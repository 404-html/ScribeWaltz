00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:02.963
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.343
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.633
<v Speaker 1>one</v>

4
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>the great and powerful Pat Miller touch.</v>

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.921
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that,</v>

6
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>but you are.</v>

7
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.281
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>

8
00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

9
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>it's an honor to have you in here.</v>

10
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching your show for a long time and you're a contrarian thinker.</v>

11
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:19.470
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

12
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>And you've,</v>

13
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>you've prompted a lot of people to think differently,</v>

14
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe it means,</v>

17
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>I think information prompts people to think differently.</v>

18
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>when they get pounded with us enough and hear it enough,</v>

20
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>eventually it starts to sink in,</v>

21
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

23
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:32.881
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

24
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:33.091
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

25
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>And when you talk about,</v>

26
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>guys who have been around like you,</v>

28
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>you are one of the real pioneers of MMA.</v>

29
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.711
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the reasons why I really wanted to have you in here.</v>

31
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I remember back when you were fighting,</v>

32
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>I remember back when you fought Matt Hume and what was that like?</v>

33
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Extreme Strand.</v>

34
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

35
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>That was John Peretti's thing.</v>

37
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:50.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

38
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.031
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

39
00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 1>you've been around,</v>

40
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.221
<v Speaker 1>you've been around.</v>

41
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>You were the early days.</v>

42
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Bare knuckle.</v>

43
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:56.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

46
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>you know when the thing is,</v>

47
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.621
<v Speaker 1>I always tell people,</v>

48
00:00:58.621 --> 00:00:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Dan Severn yeah,</v>

49
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>we flock to withdraw who's 270 pounds at the time.</v>

50
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>And he was still obviously pretty tough back then.</v>

51
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:07.021
<v Speaker 1>Still Pretty Mobile.</v>

52
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>It was not a,</v>

53
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.341
<v Speaker 1>not a fun fight.</v>

54
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you carrying his weight around for 30 minutes,</v>

55
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>but it was tough.</v>

56
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>But Matthew human was the guy that made me realize that I wasn't a fighter yet</v>

57
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.720
<v Speaker 1>cause I was 15 and no,</v>

58
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>I think I was ranked fourth in the world.</v>

59
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I fought Matt ragdolled him for basically the whole first round through him</v>

60
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>around like a rag doll.</v>

61
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>But he was just biding his time and wait.</v>

62
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>And then they caught me with some knees and damaged my nose and the ref or the,</v>

63
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.381
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

64
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>the referee and the doctor stopped the fight because back then it was very</v>

65
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>controversial.</v>

66
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want a guy with a crushed nose or whatever and so they stopped the</v>

67
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:38.851
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

68
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 1>But I realized at that point he knew a lot more than I did.</v>

69
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 1>He had.</v>

70
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>That was an interesting fight because I totally disagree with that.</v>

71
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:46.321
<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>

72
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:46.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

73
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:47.101
<v Speaker 1>I was watching it.</v>

74
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:47.401
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

75
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

76
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.380
<v Speaker 1>How can you stop a fight for a broken nose?</v>

77
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>

79
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.120
<v Speaker 1>I got headbutted.</v>

80
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I used to spar with a lot of pro boxers and I got headbutted by a pro boxer and</v>

81
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>he separated the cartilage from the bone.</v>

82
00:01:58.141 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>So that gap is still there.</v>

83
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they felt.</v>

84
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 1>My nose was bleeding a little bit,</v>

85
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:03.301
<v Speaker 1>but so that's why,</v>

86
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>that's why they stopped it.</v>

87
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

88
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.430
<v Speaker 1>but broken noses,</v>

89
00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

90
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>it happens and it's not dangerous.</v>

91
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe somebody saw those movies where you like,</v>

92
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>like remembering a movie guy would hit the bottom of the guy's nose and drive</v>

93
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 1>the bone up and it was like Mike Tyson talking about it,</v>

94
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:18.654
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

95
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

96
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>He didn't like these puts it,</v>

97
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:21.100
<v Speaker 1>puts it,</v>

98
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>but the one up to the brain,</v>

99
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 1>that might be the worst Mike Tyson impression ever heard.</v>

100
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let that go though.</v>

101
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.171
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing my best.</v>

102
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Doing my best man back then.</v>

103
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:30.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

104
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Nobody really knew.</v>

105
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Like what was dangerous,</v>

106
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>what wasn't dangerous.</v>

107
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:34.441
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like,</v>

108
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

109
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>a body of fights that we could draw upon.</v>

110
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>And I was doing televised debates with politicians at the time.</v>

111
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>We really to keep the sport legal in the state that I was scheduled to fight</v>

112
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:44.491
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

113
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>So think of how stressful it is to train for a fight,</v>

114
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:48.174
<v Speaker 1>stay healthy,</v>

115
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.440
<v Speaker 1>try and pay your bills,</v>

116
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>do all the stuff you're doing.</v>

117
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time I'm debating politicians in that state who are trying to</v>

118
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:57.570
<v Speaker 1>pass a bill to ban the sport that I'm scheduled to fight in that state.</v>

119
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.793
<v Speaker 1>I'm panicking,</v>

120
00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm freaking out.</v>

121
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>So I do my homework and I'd get in debates like represented the Boleyn from</v>

122
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Illinois.</v>

123
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.091
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

124
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>by the time we got done with the debate,</v>

125
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>he goes all agree with Mr [inaudible].</v>

126
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously,</v>

127
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that they expected to go into a debate with a punch drunk box and by the</v>

129
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>time the debate was done,</v>

130
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>I crushed him.</v>

131
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.081
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

132
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

133
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe if we could just do away with headbutts.</v>

134
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

135
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

136
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>that was his rebuttal at the end of it.</v>

137
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.823
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

139
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>I see how they think and I see that.</v>

140
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

141
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>But I think today,</v>

142
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>even to this day,</v>

143
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind headbutts.</v>

144
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't either because you train for them.</v>

145
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.341
<v Speaker 1>If they're legal,</v>

146
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're training for.</v>

147
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>And it's a legit technique.</v>

148
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Like why is it okay to slam your elbow into someone's face?</v>

149
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>But it's not okay to slam your forehand into someone's face.</v>

150
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

151
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's very effective.</v>

152
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 1>If a guy's tying you up in the guard and his head's right there,</v>

153
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>you can do that and he can't really do it back to you.</v>

154
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>It's an eye.</v>

155
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

156
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

157
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I watched when I was in my first no holds barred tournament in Chicago.</v>

158
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.631
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

159
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember the name of it anymore.</v>

160
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.113
<v Speaker 1>It's been so long.</v>

161
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.463
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

162
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I saw a guy get headbutted 42 times in the first round and he ended up winning</v>

163
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:05.914
<v Speaker 1>with a triangle.</v>

164
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Why you ended up winning the fight?</v>

165
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>It was Marcel loverage versus this guy named Johnson.</v>

166
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:10.751
<v Speaker 1>Mike Johnson,</v>

167
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I think his name was Marcel loverage ends up losing after crushing him with</v>

168
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 1>headbutts.</v>

169
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Mike Johnson's in the shower,</v>

170
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>they're running cold water on him,</v>

171
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>trying to wake him back up and he collapses and they have to throw in an</v>

172
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>alternate.</v>

173
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

174
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.030
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>

175
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

176
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Headbutts up,</v>

177
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>obviously were legal then,</v>

178
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

179
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

180
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Headbutts like nat was marked the hammer.</v>

182
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Coleman,</v>

183
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>he's on the ground,</v>

184
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 1>knees on the ground.</v>

185
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 1>You see the head on the ground.</v>

186
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

187
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.510
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

188
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>you think about when Coleman was in his prime,</v>

189
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 1>he was all about headbutts and when he fought Maurice and he took more ease</v>

190
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:42.040
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

191
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.430
<v Speaker 1>That was back in the days when headbutts were legal and Maury Smith,</v>

192
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>he defended against all that doing all of this.</v>

193
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

195
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>It's just another technique and,</v>

196
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>but without that technique,</v>

197
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like when I,</v>

198
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:53.974
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

199
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>one of the ones when I realized that taekwondo is very limited was when I</v>

200
00:04:57.071 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>started working out with kickboxers and I started getting punched in the face</v>

201
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

202
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

203
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.043
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

204
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.370
<v Speaker 1>But if I learned,</v>

205
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.533
<v Speaker 1>I've learned this,</v>

206
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

207
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 1>thing that is only good if somebody doesn't punch you in the face.</v>

208
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.291
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

209
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 1>this is terrible,</v>

210
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.440
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

211
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 1>you were an open thinker obviously,</v>

212
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 1>and you realize that the thing was with early MMA,</v>

213
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 1>everybody was so tied to their technique.</v>

214
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like being tied to a religion and refusing to see something else.</v>

215
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.493
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of that.</v>

216
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 1>So guys who are taekwondo experts,</v>

217
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers this,</v>

218
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 1>that they were so,</v>

219
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>so attached to their art that they refuse to learn anything else and they just</v>

220
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 1>die because of it.</v>

221
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 1>They get crushed because of it.</v>

222
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:36.910
<v Speaker 1>And I just early on when these guys are dumb asses,</v>

223
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you want to know how to do a lot of things?</v>

224
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:40.910
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have a big tool box,</v>

225
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>but there was always a lot of pride in your art,</v>

226
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.271
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

227
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 1>There was always a lot of guys like wrestlers who were only in the wrestling or</v>

228
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:47.261
<v Speaker 1>kickboxers,</v>

229
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>the only in the mortality just want to stand up.</v>

230
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to go to the ground.</v>

231
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:54.610
<v Speaker 1>They just want to stand up and that that just costs you in the long run.</v>

232
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you see like a real complete,</v>

233
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>like a guy</v>

234
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 2>like mighty mouse,</v>

235
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 2>like a guy like mighty mouse is at the top of the heap trained by Matt,</v>

236
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.451
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hume,</v>

237
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:02.661
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

238
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

239
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

240
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

241
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 2>And he can do everything.</v>

242
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

243
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean it doesn't matter if you're a wrestler,</v>

244
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if you're a kickboxer,</v>

245
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>

246
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked everywhere with that guy.</v>

247
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 2>And it's because he's got this just incredibly well rounded skill sets.</v>

248
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 2>And I think the days of the specialist I think are still,</v>

249
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 2>they're still kind of here.</v>

250
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised with that still the case.</v>

251
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

252
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 2>There's a few guys that can still pull it off,</v>

253
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.670
<v Speaker 2>but the guys that can pull it off or like the Damien Maya's or the wonder boys.</v>

254
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

255
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:29.621
<v Speaker 2>Like wonder boy,</v>

256
00:06:29.621 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 2>it's just such an elite striker that is,</v>

257
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 2>if he can keep the fight standing,</v>

258
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 2>he can kind of work a lot of guys and because so many guys have not done karate</v>

259
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:37.844
<v Speaker 2>and things like that.</v>

260
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

261
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 2>he's like a Rubik's cube.</v>

262
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:41.200
<v Speaker 2>They can't figure out.</v>

263
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

264
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Well he's long and that weird sideways stance with that front leg.</v>

265
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

266
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Those guys who have a good front leg like that karate style point fighting style</v>

267
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 2>that they're used to blitzing in with that good front leg.</v>

268
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Very hard to gauge that distance.</v>

269
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 2>So different.</v>

270
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

271
00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 2>I think Woodley did the best job of anybody in in fighting him and I think</v>

272
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.810
<v Speaker 2>that's like a roadmap for it because like people booed Woodley and gave Woodley</v>

273
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:06.471
<v Speaker 2>a lot of shit,</v>

274
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 2>but look Woodley's the one who heard him in both fights.</v>

275
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

276
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 2>And that that's the way you got to fight that guy.</v>

277
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 2>You can't just charge after that guy you had the criticisms of Woodley in my</v>

278
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 2>mind I think,</v>

279
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

280
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.310
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

281
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.050
<v Speaker 2>it's a two man dance right when we kept as title.</v>

282
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

283
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately that's all that matters.</v>

284
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

285
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

286
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:25.160
<v Speaker 2>If I'm the champ,</v>

287
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to keep my title.</v>

288
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing enough to when I'm not there to be the most exciting fight.</v>

289
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.010
<v Speaker 2>That was my mentality because I knew once you get,</v>

290
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 2>cause I fought totally different before I got to the EOC.</v>

291
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:39.440
<v Speaker 2>I was just a psychopath and go out and just go a hundred miles an hour until the</v>

292
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 2>guy was done.</v>

293
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

294
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 2>But once you get in the UFC,</v>

295
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 2>then that's okay,</v>

296
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:44.150
<v Speaker 2>we can cut you if you lose.</v>

297
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.481
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

298
00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:44.781
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

299
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:45.111
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

300
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:46.370
<v Speaker 2>now I gotta change the way I fight.</v>

301
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.521
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

302
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 2>there's also the wind bonus.</v>

303
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean especially now,</v>

304
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 2>did they have the wind bonus?</v>

305
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

306
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 2>that's tagged to me is a real issue.</v>

307
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.460
<v Speaker 2>I think a guy should be paid what they get paid.</v>

308
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.330
<v Speaker 2>I think if you're,</v>

309
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.290
<v Speaker 2>you have a contract,</v>

310
00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:59.060
<v Speaker 2>the contract for x amount of money,</v>

311
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 2>if you have points on the paper view that's on top of that,</v>

312
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:03.440
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that your win or loss,</v>

313
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.350
<v Speaker 2>it could be in the hands of what we have deemed completely incompetent judges.</v>

314
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 2>I see it every week,</v>

315
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.013
<v Speaker 2>every week.</v>

316
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 2>And you do a lot of commentary yourself in these smaller shows.</v>

317
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.221
<v Speaker 2>I'd imagine.</v>

318
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's even worse.</v>

319
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.250
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

320
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've gotten in trouble to the point where we had people come to us and</v>

321
00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 2>go look the promoters at different Oregon that from different organizations when</v>

322
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:26.121
<v Speaker 2>there was really,</v>

323
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:27.170
<v Speaker 2>really bad decisions.</v>

324
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:27.891
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

325
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 2>when I was working with Michael Chavela especially,</v>

326
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.310
<v Speaker 2>we were brutal on the athletic commissions and we'd hear about it and go,</v>

327
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 2>you guys need to back back off.</v>

328
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.093
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it too.</v>

329
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.740
<v Speaker 2>I heard it from athletic commissions too,</v>

330
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.280
<v Speaker 2>but I'd say go fuck yourself.</v>

331
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

332
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.380
<v Speaker 2>there's guys in there that are fighting for their life.</v>

333
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 2>They literally trained for months and months and some point,</v>

334
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.740
<v Speaker 2>someone who literally doesn't even understand martial arts is giving these guys</v>

335
00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:49.574
<v Speaker 2>a decision,</v>

336
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.900
<v Speaker 2>a loss or a win.</v>

337
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's 50% of their money.</v>

338
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.990
<v Speaker 2>And that's crazy.</v>

339
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 2>I remember the first time I witnessed it as far as a coach when my IFL team was</v>

340
00:08:58.021 --> 00:08:58.900
<v Speaker 2>fighting in taxes.</v>

341
00:08:58.901 --> 00:08:59.401
<v Speaker 2>We are fighting,</v>

342
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:02.970
<v Speaker 2>I think bosses team and I looked at the judges and all of them.</v>

343
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:04.040
<v Speaker 2>One of them had a uh,</v>

344
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:09.230
<v Speaker 2>a bouffant hairdo and old lady and then two old guys with white hair.</v>

345
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 2>And I went back to the locker room and I go,</v>

346
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:12.024
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

347
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 2>you can't let this go to the judges.</v>

348
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 2>They're like one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel.</v>

349
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 2>They know nothing about what they're watching.</v>

350
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Like we are in deep shit.</v>

351
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 2>If we can't do it well it's,</v>

352
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:27.270
<v Speaker 2>I think boxing is a very complicated art and I think it's a very difficult thing</v>

353
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 2>to see to score,</v>

354
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's way more easy to score then martial arts.</v>

355
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

356
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.150
<v Speaker 2>There's so much going on when a fight goes to the ground.</v>

357
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:36.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

358
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who,</v>

359
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.690
<v Speaker 2>a judge who literally said to me in the middle of a flight,</v>

360
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 2>one of the female judges or referees rather,</v>

361
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

362
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.170
<v Speaker 2>judges,</v>

363
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.910
<v Speaker 2>one of female judges turned him and go,</v>

364
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 2>what is he doing?</v>

365
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Like what is he doing now?</v>

366
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Speaker 2>The guy was going for Kamora.</v>

367
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:49.523
<v Speaker 2>What is he doing?</v>

368
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.853
<v Speaker 2>What is he doing?</v>

369
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.773
<v Speaker 2>Adelaide.</v>

370
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.001
<v Speaker 2>Adelaide Berg,</v>

371
00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:53.151
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

372
00:09:53.151 --> 00:09:53.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

373
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:53.990
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>

374
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.000
<v Speaker 2>we've heard you,</v>

375
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.930
<v Speaker 2>you talked about her during one of the UFC.</v>

376
00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean carmia joking around with his lady.</v>

377
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Very nice lady.</v>

378
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

379
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:03.760
<v Speaker 2>But like I said,</v>

380
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 2>my mom's a really nice lady too.</v>

381
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:06.610
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to judge when a judge,</v>

382
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.250
<v Speaker 2>but I said the Adelaide bird before,</v>

383
00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 2>the pride in Las Vegas Lawler was fighting in that one.</v>

384
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

385
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:11.730
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

386
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to ask.</v>

387
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.180
<v Speaker 2>And I walked up to her and I go,</v>

388
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.001
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

389
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:15.834
<v Speaker 2>I'm new to the sport.</v>

390
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Could you tell me what a triangle choke is?</v>

391
00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:18.420
<v Speaker 2>And she looked at me and went,</v>

392
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.570
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

393
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:20.403
<v Speaker 2>walked away.</v>

394
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:23.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

395
00:10:23.671 --> 00:10:26.010
<v Speaker 2>she's just [inaudible] maybe she's like,</v>

396
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:26.844
<v Speaker 2>this is a trap.</v>

397
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I fucking pat villages to try and trap guy with cauliflower ears asking me new</v>

398
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.670
<v Speaker 2>to this sport.</v>

399
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

400
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 2>He probably had like a transparent grin,</v>

401
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.950
<v Speaker 2>like you couldn't hold it back.</v>

402
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 2>You know those Grenz just it's,</v>

403
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.300
<v Speaker 2>it's sad that this goes,</v>

404
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:42.970
<v Speaker 2>it's awful.</v>

405
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.640
<v Speaker 2>They suspend fighters constantly,</v>

406
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:47.910
<v Speaker 2>but one are they going to start suspending referees and judges?</v>

407
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.440
<v Speaker 2>I think I've only seen it one time.</v>

408
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.180
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

409
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean judges in,</v>

410
00:10:51.021 --> 00:10:51.261
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

411
00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:51.491
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

412
00:10:51.491 --> 00:10:53.340
<v Speaker 2>in for sure referees as well.</v>

413
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.560
<v Speaker 2>But I think that the,</v>

414
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 2>the real thing that's so disappointing to me is that there's a wealth of martial</v>

415
00:10:58.711 --> 00:10:59.880
<v Speaker 2>arts experts out there.</v>

416
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Like there's so many.</v>

417
00:11:01.221 --> 00:11:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

418
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.230
<v Speaker 2>there's so many good coaches that would be great judges.</v>

419
00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:06.860
<v Speaker 2>There's so many great x fighters.</v>

420
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 2>There's so many people that are just really well versed in martial arts.</v>

421
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:11.520
<v Speaker 2>They'd be able to tell.</v>

422
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.640
<v Speaker 2>And I also think three people is a ridiculously small number.</v>

423
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.771
<v Speaker 2>I think for you you're,</v>

424
00:11:15.771 --> 00:11:16.770
<v Speaker 2>you're like five judges.</v>

425
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

426
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 2>like five judges would.</v>

427
00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:18.971
<v Speaker 2>I think it makes sense.</v>

428
00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of the shitty decisions.</v>

429
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.220
<v Speaker 2>That's a good idea because if it's two and one and you like,</v>

430
00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:24.780
<v Speaker 2>there's sometimes you get a split decision.</v>

431
00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:25.021
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

432
00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:26.100
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck?</v>

433
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Like one person saw this completely wrong and the other two guys got it right.</v>

434
00:11:30.301 --> 00:11:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Thank God the other two guys were there.</v>

435
00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:31.621
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

436
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:32.880
<v Speaker 2>if there's five people,</v>

437
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.440
<v Speaker 2>and this happens more than once,</v>

438
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:34.681
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

439
00:11:34.681 --> 00:11:34.891
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

440
00:11:34.891 --> 00:11:35.910
<v Speaker 2>we've got a weak link here.</v>

441
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.290
<v Speaker 2>Let's get rid of this person.</v>

442
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

443
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:38.603
<v Speaker 2>Let's get rid of this person.</v>

444
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.640
<v Speaker 2>One judge will have it unanimous one way and the other judges will have it</v>

445
00:11:41.641 --> 00:11:42.420
<v Speaker 2>unanimous the other.</v>

446
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:42.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

447
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:42.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

448
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.660
<v Speaker 2>how the heck they should be.</v>

449
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.070
<v Speaker 2>They should be held accountable.</v>

450
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:47.361
<v Speaker 2>They should.</v>

451
00:11:47.361 --> 00:11:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Someone should have to sit down with them and say,</v>

452
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 2>got to explain.</v>

453
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.971
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

454
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:51.661
<v Speaker 2>what are you seeing?</v>

455
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:52.081
<v Speaker 2>Like what's,</v>

456
00:11:52.081 --> 00:11:53.130
<v Speaker 2>let's watch the round.</v>

457
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Sit Down with me</v>

458
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 1>and tell me how you think this guy was getting the fuck beat out of him.</v>

459
00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.673
<v Speaker 1>Was winning.</v>

460
00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:58.751
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

461
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:01.140
<v Speaker 1>it's criminal dude seen,</v>

462
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.070
<v Speaker 1>screwed up.</v>

463
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

464
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:03.580
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

465
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.360
<v Speaker 1>it's heartbreaking.</v>

466
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.193
<v Speaker 1>It's heartbreaking.</v>

467
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 1>It literally is like stealing money from these kids,</v>

468
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:08.360
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

469
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.193
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

470
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 1>I just don't like the wind bonus,</v>

471
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:11.231
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

472
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's a bad,</v>

473
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody fights harder for it.</v>

474
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.201
<v Speaker 1>See.</v>

475
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:14.860
<v Speaker 1>And I don't even,</v>

476
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't even necessarily subscribe to,</v>

477
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.290
<v Speaker 1>fight of the night and knock out of the night and stuff like that.</v>

479
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

480
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

481
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

482
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.090
<v Speaker 1>I think they just bring back the yellow cards for stalling type stuff.</v>

483
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.301
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

484
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 1>But how pride did it,</v>

485
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.920
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

486
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a great way to do things.</v>

487
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 1>And when pride did it,</v>

488
00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:30.880
<v Speaker 1>what did they take 10% of your purse?</v>

489
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:31.961
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

490
00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 1>And know,</v>

491
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 1>and they would end up,</v>

492
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:33.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

493
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:35.590
<v Speaker 1>you'd get dqued eventually,</v>

494
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

495
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

496
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 1>We pull the red card and you're done.</v>

497
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:37.741
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

498
00:12:37.741 --> 00:12:39.280
<v Speaker 1>If it was more than one yellow card,</v>

499
00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:40.010
<v Speaker 1>you get DQ.</v>

500
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.540
<v Speaker 1>So they would give you a yellow card if they thought that you were either doing</v>

501
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:45.230
<v Speaker 1>something illegal or if style,</v>

502
00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:46.750
<v Speaker 1>age of stalling or whatever.</v>

503
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:47.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

504
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:48.520
<v Speaker 1>in college wrestling.</v>

505
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:50.110
<v Speaker 1>And they knew that they had to change things,</v>

506
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:50.651
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

507
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:52.990
<v Speaker 1>They had to speed up the action and they started calling,</v>

508
00:12:52.991 --> 00:12:56.410
<v Speaker 1>stalling a lot faster in college wrestling and it changed college wrestling guys</v>

509
00:12:56.411 --> 00:12:56.990
<v Speaker 1>get after it.</v>

510
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

511
00:12:57.881 --> 00:13:01.360
<v Speaker 1>my problem with it though is that there's referees at separate fighters when</v>

512
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:03.400
<v Speaker 1>they're working real hard against the cage.</v>

513
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 1>And I think again,</v>

514
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 1>it's guys who don't understand,</v>

515
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand how difficult it says when you have,</v>

516
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:10.240
<v Speaker 1>one guy was trying to take the other guy down,</v>

517
00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:13.690
<v Speaker 1>the other guy is trying to defend their landing shots in between trying to open</v>

518
00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:15.340
<v Speaker 1>up space and then the referee will say,</v>

519
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:16.170
<v Speaker 1>keep working.</v>

520
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to separate you guys get,</v>

521
00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:17.741
<v Speaker 1>don't work.</v>

522
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck are you watching it?</v>

523
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 1>They're battling their battles.</v>

524
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.990
<v Speaker 1>They literally don't understand the position.</v>

525
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

526
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

527
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a giant problem.</v>

528
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.160
<v Speaker 1>And think about how many referees have never truly trained right?</v>

529
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.170
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

530
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:29.830
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

531
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.700
<v Speaker 1>And if they did train,</v>

532
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:32.080
<v Speaker 1>it was a long fucking time ago.</v>

533
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:34.450
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the guys going in there with big fat guts.</v>

534
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:37.390
<v Speaker 1>And how many times have you called fights and all the years you've been calling</v>

535
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:39.250
<v Speaker 1>fights and been saying,</v>

536
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 1>he's out,</v>

537
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.073
<v Speaker 1>he's out,</v>

538
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:41.891
<v Speaker 1>he's out,</v>

539
00:13:41.891 --> 00:13:42.701
<v Speaker 1>stopped the fight,</v>

540
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:43.321
<v Speaker 1>stopped the fight,</v>

541
00:13:43.321 --> 00:13:43.990
<v Speaker 1>stopped the fight.</v>

542
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you're so close to it that you don't see it as well.</v>

543
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:47.470
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

544
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.400
<v Speaker 1>that's not an excuse.</v>

545
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:50.060
<v Speaker 1>It's an excuse because you know,</v>

546
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.750
<v Speaker 1>you've trained for so many years in martial arts,</v>

547
00:13:52.751 --> 00:13:53.320
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

548
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:53.651
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

549
00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 1>when somebody is unconscious from a choke,</v>

550
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:55.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

551
00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:57.040
<v Speaker 1>when a joints getting destroyed,</v>

552
00:13:57.041 --> 00:13:57.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

553
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:58.690
<v Speaker 1>you've been around it enough.</v>

554
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.490
<v Speaker 1>You've trained high level enough where you see it,</v>

555
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

556
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.360
<v Speaker 1>you can see their stomach where it's going in and out really hard.</v>

557
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:04.751
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

558
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:05.440
<v Speaker 1>they're unconscious,</v>

559
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.273
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

560
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Where referees look at somebody in their eyes are wide open while his eyes are</v>

561
00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:09.551
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>

562
00:14:09.551 --> 00:14:11.700
<v Speaker 1>So we must be conscious Europe moron.</v>

563
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand,</v>

564
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:12.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

565
00:14:12.711 --> 00:14:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

566
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

567
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.980
<v Speaker 1>What do you have thoughts on?</v>

568
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

569
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:16.900
<v Speaker 1>forcing tap outs?</v>

570
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Like if a guy gets his arm broken,</v>

571
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.320
<v Speaker 1>like that's a controversial thing.</v>

572
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Like if stopping a fight,</v>

573
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.160
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about Tim Silvia and Frank Mir?</v>

574
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

575
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Tim got his forearms crazy one because in that one I kind of agree with her</v>

576
00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:30.130
<v Speaker 1>because it wasn't an elbow,</v>

577
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.500
<v Speaker 1>it was the middle of the arm.</v>

578
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Both forearm bones went at the same time.</v>

579
00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:37.150
<v Speaker 1>And so I didn't see that angle.</v>

580
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

581
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.630
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

582
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Tim's back was to us in the corner and herb stops it and I,</v>

583
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.810
<v Speaker 1>and Tim gets up and he's like,</v>

584
00:14:43.811 --> 00:14:44.260
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>

585
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:44.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

586
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.760
<v Speaker 1>doing a great acting job,</v>

587
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.390
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

588
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.223
<v Speaker 1>Tim,</v>

589
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:47.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

590
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason was able to pull that off.</v>

591
00:14:49.661 --> 00:14:49.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

592
00:14:49.871 --> 00:14:50.800
<v Speaker 1>that's not a pleasant feeling.</v>

593
00:14:50.801 --> 00:14:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

594
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

595
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:56.650
<v Speaker 1>your arms snap in height and Tim gets up and he's like yelling at her.</v>

596
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I go in,</v>

597
00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I start yelling at Herbert.</v>

598
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.081
<v Speaker 1>Herb's like Pat,</v>

599
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God,</v>

600
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:02.210
<v Speaker 1>his arm is broken.</v>

601
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.470
<v Speaker 1>He's pleased.</v>

602
00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 1>And then I see the replay on the big screen and I got her,</v>

603
00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:06.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

604
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I remember the crowd was booing and then we played the replay back and I'm like,</v>

605
00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:11.330
<v Speaker 1>watch it,</v>

606
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.170
<v Speaker 1>watch it right here.</v>

607
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Slashing here.</v>

608
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:13.340
<v Speaker 1>But he'd go,</v>

609
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.860
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

610
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.711
<v Speaker 1>And then I told him,</v>

611
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I go wave to the crowd when we walk out of the cage with your broken arm.</v>

612
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.740
<v Speaker 1>So Tim goes like,</v>

613
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.190
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

614
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:22.941
<v Speaker 1>And then we got back,</v>

615
00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:25.700
<v Speaker 1>we got backstage and the doctor looked at it and I go,</v>

616
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:26.781
<v Speaker 1>how bad is that?</v>

617
00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

618
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

619
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.363
<v Speaker 1>fucking arts.</v>

620
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

621
00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:29.480
<v Speaker 1>This hurts.</v>

622
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

623
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

624
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:30.920
<v Speaker 1>It was bad.</v>

625
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.730
<v Speaker 1>So the doctor that did the doctor then,</v>

626
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.220
<v Speaker 1>the doctor that did it was a good,</v>

627
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.091
<v Speaker 1>good friend of mine,</v>

628
00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:38.060
<v Speaker 1>orthopedic Guy who I trained for many years.</v>

629
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.500
<v Speaker 1>He was a bull rider at one time and then became an orthopedic surgeon and then</v>

630
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:43.970
<v Speaker 1>trained with me and kickboxing.</v>

631
00:15:43.971 --> 00:15:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

632
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.081
<v Speaker 1>Tough guy.</v>

633
00:15:45.081 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Tough,</v>

634
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.710

<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

637
00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:52.991
<v Speaker 1>I've never had to order plates for a tibia bone to replace to put some of these</v>

638
00:15:55.551 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 1>foreign bones back together.</v>

639
00:15:56.541 --> 00:15:56.840
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

640

641
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

642
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.651
<v Speaker 1>Tim's,</v>

643
00:15:59.651 --> 00:16:00.120
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

644

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

645
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:00.800
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

646
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.850
<v Speaker 1>his bones were massive.</v>

647
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:02.181
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

648
00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:03.014
<v Speaker 1>they don't even make,</v>

649
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I had to use Tibia plates.</v>

650
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

651
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

652
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Healed 100%.</v>

653
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

654
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

655
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's a long time though,</v>

656
00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:10.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

657
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Like Dad,</v>

658
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.600
<v Speaker 1>dad really struggled with that.</v>

659
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.100
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

660
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I remember him saying thank you to herb dean for saving as career.</v>

661
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

662
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.451
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

663
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:18.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

664
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

665
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.150
<v Speaker 1>if he let him go on and that,</v>

666
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 1>that thing got taken down.</v>

667
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Here it goes.</v>

668
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Once it breaks through the skin,</v>

669
00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:25.460
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

670
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.420
<v Speaker 1>That becomes a giant issue for infections.</v>

671
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.341
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of,</v>

672
00:16:28.341 --> 00:16:29.174
<v Speaker 1>here it is right here.</v>

673
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Jamie pulled it up.</v>

674
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.461
<v Speaker 1>Frank Mir.</v>

675
00:16:31.461 --> 00:16:33.920
<v Speaker 1>That mother fucker has broken more arms.</v>

676
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.300
<v Speaker 1>They're not showing it right here.</v>

677
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

678
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.790
<v Speaker 1>it says was right on the cup is that may play.</v>

679
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:38.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

680
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.260
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

681
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.450
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing about metal cups.</v>

682
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird little loophole.</v>

683
00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

684
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.780
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird angle to look at.</v>

685
00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:45.614
<v Speaker 1>That</v>

686
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Daddy,</v>

687
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:48.860
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird angle.</v>

688
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:49.753
<v Speaker 1>That was ugly.</v>

689
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:50.360
<v Speaker 1>It was ugly.</v>

690
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Those metal cups,</v>

691
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:51.561
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

692
00:16:51.561 --> 00:16:52.390
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird,</v>

693
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:52.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

694
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.140
<v Speaker 1>still loophole.</v>

695
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Like you could still wear those,</v>

696
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.200
<v Speaker 1>those tie cops steal.</v>

697
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to,</v>

698
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.550
<v Speaker 1>but you're kicking metal and it's also a crazy fulcrum.</v>

699
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.160
<v Speaker 1>If you got a guy in an arm bar that's,</v>

700
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:04.730
<v Speaker 1>you got to fucking metal rod there.</v>

701
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I like it though.</v>

702
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:05.980
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

703
00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:06.813
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you do.</v>

704
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.860
<v Speaker 1>But the thing with the old timers that taught me and k one and Muay Thai was you</v>

705
00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:16.910
<v Speaker 1>take those metal cups and you take a sheet metal screws from the inside out and</v>

706
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:17.720
<v Speaker 1>you screw this,</v>

707
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.910
<v Speaker 1>put the sheet metal screws through and then back them back out.</v>

708
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:22.040
<v Speaker 1>So there's raised edges everywhere on it,</v>

709
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:22.933
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

710
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:23.781
<v Speaker 1>So you wear that.</v>

711
00:17:23.781 --> 00:17:24.180
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

712
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.170
<v Speaker 1>if they need you or kick you in the groin at shreds their meetup on their knee</v>

713
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:27.860
<v Speaker 1>or their foot.</v>

714
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

715
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:32.180
<v Speaker 1>So that's what the old tie fighters would do is that's the way they would do</v>

716
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:32.571
<v Speaker 1>their cups.</v>

717
00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:33.920
<v Speaker 1>So that's how I started doing it.</v>

718
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.690
<v Speaker 1>So if they're going to low blow me,</v>

719
00:17:35.691 --> 00:17:37.310
<v Speaker 1>they're going to shred the fricking leg up.</v>

720
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:41.090
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is it also works if you get a guy and you mount them and</v>

721
00:17:41.091 --> 00:17:42.650
<v Speaker 1>you drive that thing into his sternum,</v>

722
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.320
<v Speaker 1>then you've got like you're shoving into his sternum.</v>

723
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.580
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a weapon.</v>

724
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:47.930
<v Speaker 1>It seems a little bit,</v>

725
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 1>it seems a little bit like little cheating.</v>

726
00:17:50.191 --> 00:17:50.660
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

727
00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.001
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

728
00:17:51.001 --> 00:17:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

729
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.880
<v Speaker 1>there was a couple of other guys that did that back in the day,</v>

730
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 1>especially the Chicago circuit because I was fighting kickboxing and in Chicago</v>

731
00:17:57.571 --> 00:17:58.560
<v Speaker 1>a lot was Chicago,</v>

732
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:00.120
<v Speaker 1>like a rougher circuit dude.</v>

733
00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:00.570
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

734
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

735
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.740
<v Speaker 1>they would do k one rules Muay Thai and then I started in the PKC style</v>

736
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.390
<v Speaker 1>originally and I hated it because it was,</v>

737
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:06.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:18:06.901 --> 00:18:07.800
<v Speaker 1>the light tree,</v>

739
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.450
<v Speaker 1>like the dragsters,</v>

740
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.480
<v Speaker 1>the old PKC was you get one kick in one light lights like PKA.</v>

741
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

742
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:16.651
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

743
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Basically it was all the same shit right above the waist.</v>

744
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Kickboxing.</v>

745
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

746
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:21.750
<v Speaker 1>With the Silk Pants and that shit.</v>

747
00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:22.670
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

748
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.270
<v Speaker 1>it was brutal foam boots on.</v>

749
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:25.110
<v Speaker 1>So when I started,</v>

750
00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't flexible.</v>

751
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:26.101
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

752
00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:28.800
<v Speaker 1>That was a wrestler who had some boxing experience.</v>

753
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.740
<v Speaker 1>And the reason they did that was so boxers wouldn't come in and destroy</v>

754
00:18:31.741 --> 00:18:32.540
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

755
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

756
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.220
<v Speaker 1>So the karate guys could survive and do pretty well.</v>

757
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 1>So that just having to get the allotted eight kicks per round.</v>

758
00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I hated it because it was all kick above the waist.</v>

759
00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't that flexible.</v>

760
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty shitty.</v>

761
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:45.390
<v Speaker 1>It kicks when I,</v>

762
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.261
<v Speaker 1>when I first started.</v>

763
00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

764
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.910
<v Speaker 1>So it was just a waste of time.</v>

765
00:18:47.911 --> 00:18:51.330
<v Speaker 1>And then I ran into the movie tie thing and the k one rules fights,</v>

766
00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:51.660
<v Speaker 1>and I went,</v>

767
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.381
<v Speaker 1>this is my thing.</v>

768
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:53.400
<v Speaker 1>I can kick them in the legs.</v>

769
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:54.234
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>

770
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:54.571
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

771
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:56.310
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time we got kicked in the leg,</v>

772
00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:56.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

773
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:56.971
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

774
00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:58.380
<v Speaker 1>this is such a game changer.</v>

775
00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Because in taekwondo it was like,</v>

776
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:00.803
<v Speaker 1>it was illegal.</v>

777
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.320
<v Speaker 1>It was illegal to kick below the waist and it was legal to punch in the face.</v>

778
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.720
<v Speaker 1>So it was great for learning dexterity of the legs.</v>

779
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.860
<v Speaker 1>But the f the moment I started training with Thai guys and I got kicked once,</v>

780
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.431
<v Speaker 1>just once,</v>

781
00:19:11.431 --> 00:19:11.830
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

782
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:12.663
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

783
00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.350
<v Speaker 1>should do this,</v>

784
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.470
<v Speaker 1>this should be the thing that's so painful.</v>

785
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.311
<v Speaker 1>It's so painful.</v>

786
00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:18.210
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

787
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not just painful.</v>

788
00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like your leg goes dead.</v>

789
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

790
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:21.470
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

791
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.190
<v Speaker 1>it's this weird feeling.</v>

792
00:19:23.191 --> 00:19:23.520
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

793
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

794
00:19:24.001 --> 00:19:24.834
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>

795
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.640
<v Speaker 1>the SOA effective.</v>

796
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

797
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.210
<v Speaker 1>And also that you could do it from such a close range.</v>

798
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.020
<v Speaker 1>They can be in the clinch and blast somebody in the leg and her.</v>

799
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

800
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.690
<v Speaker 1>So the worst experience of my life sparring was Arthur Murray on a Souza.</v>

801
00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:43.320
<v Speaker 1>He was the guy in the old ibcs in Brazil that laid Vander Lee silver's.</v>

802
00:19:43.321 --> 00:19:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I wide open and all the meat was hanging down past his eye.</v>

803
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.760
<v Speaker 1>That was Arthur Mariana Sousa.</v>

804
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:48.990
<v Speaker 1>And they remembered that guy,</v>

805
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.681
<v Speaker 1>great striker,</v>

806
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:52.620
<v Speaker 1>trained in Holland for a lot of years and he would come up with Omri Pritesh and</v>

807
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:53.454
<v Speaker 1>live with me.</v>

808
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.970
<v Speaker 1>When Tash was the elite guy on the planet grappling,</v>

809
00:19:56.971 --> 00:19:57.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

810
00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.990
<v Speaker 1>So we had the best of both worlds where the wicked striker and one of the best</v>

811
00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:03.510
<v Speaker 1>grapplers in the world and he'd come up and then we'd just train hard,</v>

812
00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:04.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

813
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:04.891
<v Speaker 1>For six,</v>

814
00:20:04.891 --> 00:20:05.850
<v Speaker 1>eight weeks at a time.</v>

815
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.280
<v Speaker 1>And Arthur started low kicking the shit on there.</v>

816
00:20:09.281 --> 00:20:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Everybody at my gym,</v>

817
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.780
<v Speaker 1>we weren't great Muay Thai guys at that time,</v>

818
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:13.730
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

819
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.170
<v Speaker 1>the experience of watching he,</v>

820
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.133
<v Speaker 1>he started,</v>

821
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:17.980
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing,</v>

822
00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 1>he started getting to the back leg,</v>

823
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

824
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

825
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.400
<v Speaker 1>you can throw the cross and step outside and come back and,</v>

826
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 1>and just tap me on the same spot over and over on your back leg and you're</v>

827
00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:28.110
<v Speaker 1>always taking your weight off that leg off the cross.</v>

828
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Your weight goes on it.</v>

829
00:20:29.431 --> 00:20:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Then it comes back off of it as you're stepping right when the kick hit.</v>

830
00:20:32.381 --> 00:20:33.121
<v Speaker 1>So it's like Jello,</v>

831
00:20:33.121 --> 00:20:33.954
<v Speaker 1>your clubs and yellow.</v>

832
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll just cut right to the femur bone every time he,</v>

833
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.210
<v Speaker 1>he kicked me like three times in a row in the exact same spot and that I went</v>

834
00:20:42.211 --> 00:20:43.044
<v Speaker 1>and went</v>

835
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.241
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

836
00:20:45.241 --> 00:20:45.780
<v Speaker 1>patch,</v>

837
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.070
<v Speaker 1>you know with a Brazilian accent.</v>

838
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.291
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

839
00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:47.561
<v Speaker 1>patch,</v>

840
00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

841
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:48.251
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

842
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Kick you in that leg anymore.</v>

843
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:49.811
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

844
00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:50.231
<v Speaker 1>no dude,</v>

845
00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:51.610
<v Speaker 1>I need to learn the hard way.</v>

846
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.701
<v Speaker 1>I need to learn the hard way.</v>

847
00:20:52.701 --> 00:20:52.890
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

848
00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:53.141
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

849
00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:53.590
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

850
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.140
<v Speaker 1>cross low kick fall down balling.</v>

851
00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.710
<v Speaker 1>He had Jens Pulver jumping like this,</v>

852
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.573
<v Speaker 1>like a monkey.</v>

853
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.120
<v Speaker 1>He was so afraid of his low kicks and then you fucked for days afterwards.</v>

854
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

855
00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:05.254
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to get chicken</v>

856
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Gabe.</v>

857
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:06.810
<v Speaker 3>When you try to train,</v>

858
00:21:06.811 --> 00:21:07.740
<v Speaker 3>you're all jacked up.</v>

859
00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:08.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

860
00:21:08.701 --> 00:21:09.190
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

861
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.360
<v Speaker 3>it's an amazing skill that,</v>

862
00:21:11.361 --> 00:21:14.100
<v Speaker 3>that the ties really figured out how to do it right.</v>

863
00:21:14.101 --> 00:21:15.670
<v Speaker 3>And me Kill Catia and obviously had it,</v>

864
00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:16.710
<v Speaker 3>a lot of martial arts had it,</v>

865
00:21:16.711 --> 00:21:17.610
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

866
00:21:17.611 --> 00:21:19.200
<v Speaker 3>the ties figured it out.</v>

867
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

868
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.820
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of crazy when you think about this one small island.</v>

869
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.520
<v Speaker 3>It's one small country and they,</v>

870
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.930
<v Speaker 3>because of gambling and because they had all those fights and they just figured</v>

871
00:21:30.931 --> 00:21:32.700
<v Speaker 3>out a totally different method of training,</v>

872
00:21:32.701 --> 00:21:34.040
<v Speaker 3>a totally different method of fighting.</v>

873
00:21:34.041 --> 00:21:34.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

874
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

875
00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Pretty impressive.</v>

876
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.810
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about the history of of Thai fighting between the,</v>

877
00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.940
<v Speaker 1>the Laotians on the ties during times of peace,</v>

878
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.900
<v Speaker 1>the soldiers would fight each other and all that sort of stuff.</v>

879
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Just a bunch of scary people and they're the nicest people in the world.</v>

880
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.621
<v Speaker 1>The nicest people.</v>

881
00:21:48.621 --> 00:21:51.140
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't meet any nicer people who will completely requeue.</v>

882
00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:52.240
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird because like</v>

883
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:53.150
<v Speaker 3>when you meet ties,</v>

884
00:21:53.151 --> 00:21:54.410
<v Speaker 3>especially even tie fighters,</v>

885
00:21:54.411 --> 00:21:55.730
<v Speaker 3>they're so friendly.</v>

886
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.550
<v Speaker 3>They're so friendly and humble and warm.</v>

887
00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.940
<v Speaker 3>And then when you watch him fight like</v>

888
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

889
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of crazy.</v>

890
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

891
00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:03.161
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

892
00:22:03.161 --> 00:22:03.910
<v Speaker 1>so my,</v>

893
00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:04.721
<v Speaker 1>my Muay Thai coach,</v>

894
00:22:04.721 --> 00:22:05.850
<v Speaker 1>a guy named long longly,</v>

895
00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.000
<v Speaker 1>his last name was not long way.</v>

896
00:22:07.001 --> 00:22:08.860
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot longer than that.</v>

897
00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:09.900
<v Speaker 1>But he was a stadium champion,</v>

898
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:10.631
<v Speaker 1>lived in Peoria,</v>

899
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:15.631
<v Speaker 1>Illinois and the ghetto and he had a little shitty basement with type with like</v>

900
00:22:16.511 --> 00:22:16.970
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

901
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:17.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

902
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.060
<v Speaker 1>banana bags and all that sort of stuff.</v>

903
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.710
<v Speaker 1>And I found the amount of sheer luck.</v>

904
00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said,</v>

905
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.280
<v Speaker 1>there's this guy in Peoria that was a stadium champion.</v>

906
00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:25.114
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy.</v>

907
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.410
<v Speaker 1>So I went to see him and he taught me how to clinch do clench work and he was</v>

908
00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:30.910
<v Speaker 1>140 pounds maybe.</v>

909
00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:34.060
<v Speaker 1>And he put you in the clench all the years of wrestling and everything else.</v>

910
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:34.894
<v Speaker 1>Didn't matter.</v>

911
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean I felt like a dog in a lake with a raccoon hanging on my head.</v>

912
00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.020
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

913
00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:40.290
<v Speaker 1>to me</v>

914
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.680
<v Speaker 3>one thing that people don't realize that there are real fans of the sport is</v>

915
00:22:43.681 --> 00:22:45.810
<v Speaker 3>that Moitai is a lot about grappling.</v>

916
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

917
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.490
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot about that clinch work.</v>

918
00:22:47.491 --> 00:22:51.690
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things that I really like lion fight above a lot of the</v>

919
00:22:51.691 --> 00:22:55.200
<v Speaker 3>other kickboxing organizations is that they let those guys work in the clinch</v>

920
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.910
<v Speaker 3>and elbows in the clinch.</v>

921
00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:57.973
<v Speaker 3>And they say it's a,</v>

922
00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:58.471
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

923
00:22:58.471 --> 00:22:59.820
<v Speaker 3>like we were saying about headbutts,</v>

924
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.490
<v Speaker 3>these elements are very effective,</v>

925
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:03.810
<v Speaker 3>so why remove them?</v>

926
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:09.480
<v Speaker 1>It's the what's tolerable to the politicians and the public and all the other</v>

927
00:23:09.481 --> 00:23:10.314
<v Speaker 1>guard</v>

928
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:10.930
<v Speaker 3>clinch.</v>

929
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Everything should be there,</v>

930
00:23:12.101 --> 00:23:12.670
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

931
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:13.810
<v Speaker 3>I think everything should be there.</v>

932
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:16.360
<v Speaker 3>I think the real issue is that the cage,</v>

933
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.590
<v Speaker 3>the real issue is the cage.</v>

934
00:23:17.591 --> 00:23:18.191
<v Speaker 3>My opinion,</v>

935
00:23:18.191 --> 00:23:20.530
<v Speaker 3>because the cage presents this artificial barrier,</v>

936
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.771
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

937
00:23:20.771 --> 00:23:21.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've been,</v>

938
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm beating a dead horse here because I've been saying they should find a</v>

939
00:23:23.921 --> 00:23:24.790
<v Speaker 3>basketball courts.</v>

940
00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:25.241
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

941
00:23:25.241 --> 00:23:27.410
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to have a basketball game and a basketball court,</v>

942
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.270
<v Speaker 1>we serve a striker,</v>

943
00:23:29.271 --> 00:23:29.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

944
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

945
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.420
<v Speaker 1>The rustlers are able to get you against the cage.</v>

946
00:23:32.421 --> 00:23:33.710
<v Speaker 1>You Yank your legs out from underneath you.</v>

947
00:23:33.711 --> 00:23:34.610
<v Speaker 1>I beat the shit out of you.</v>

948
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.210
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

949
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.070
<v Speaker 1>it is an advantage for the wrestlers.</v>

950
00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.070
<v Speaker 3>It's also an advantage for the wrestlers and that a guy's not going to be able</v>

951
00:23:40.071 --> 00:23:42.710
<v Speaker 3>to put his back up against the cage and get back up again.</v>

952
00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.693
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

953
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.500
<v Speaker 3>Rambler has you down the center.</v>

954
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to</v>

955
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 1>earn that stand up.</v>

956
00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:50.540
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna have to actually either reverse the position or figure out a real</v>

957
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:54.620
<v Speaker 1>escape because so many guys are so good at wall walking and there's so many,</v>

958
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.180
<v Speaker 1>and they're also good at defending a submission by keeping one side pressed up</v>

959
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:00.890
<v Speaker 1>against the cage and then attend tender back.</v>

960
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

961
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:01.980
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

962
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's an artificial environment like the cage and it's also,</v>

963
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.430
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to see,</v>

964
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.690
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in the audience,</v>

965
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:09.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

966
00:24:09.411 --> 00:24:11.690
<v Speaker 1>it's actually better sometimes to be home watching.</v>

967
00:24:11.691 --> 00:24:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

968
00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.700
<v Speaker 1>I like the boxing rings for fights.</v>

969
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:14.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

970
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.070
<v Speaker 1>they go through the ropes now and then whatever.</v>

971
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.023
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

972
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.000
<v Speaker 1>But it's a lot better for people at home watching the,</v>

973
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 1>and for the live crowd,</v>

974
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.460
<v Speaker 1>there's just not that cage.</v>

975
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.760
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that focus problem and cameras.</v>

976
00:24:25.761 --> 00:24:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

977
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:26.481
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

978
00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I think Bella tour actually nailed it with their kickboxing ring because they</v>

979
00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:32.930
<v Speaker 1>put this big circle around it so you can't fall through.</v>

980
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Like remember when Bernard Hopkins fought Joe Smith and his last fight,</v>

981
00:24:36.381 --> 00:24:38.720
<v Speaker 1>he went through the ropes and landed on his fucking head.</v>

982
00:24:38.721 --> 00:24:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

983
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:39.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

984
00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:41.900
<v Speaker 1>this is a terrible way for a legend to go out,</v>

985
00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.050
<v Speaker 1>like to be,</v>

986
00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:43.411
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

987
00:24:43.411 --> 00:24:47.000
<v Speaker 1>it's the rope ropes were loose and he gets clipped while he was already going</v>

988
00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:47.330
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

989
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:48.470
<v Speaker 1>You just goes right through the hill.</v>

990
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

991
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.390
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous that he could fall four feet and land on his fucking head.</v>

992
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:55.700
<v Speaker 1>That was the fight where Bernard was talking tons of shit before the fight.</v>

993
00:24:55.701 --> 00:24:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

994
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Was he talking lot of Shit?</v>

995
00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:58.500
<v Speaker 1>He was talking a lot of shows.</v>

996
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:59.300
<v Speaker 1>His last fight,</v>

997
00:24:59.300 --> 00:24:59.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

998
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.490
<v Speaker 1>and probably realized,</v>

999
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean Bernard Hopkins was getting his ass kicked by Antwan Eccles who trained</v>

1000
00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:07.280
<v Speaker 1>at pinions boxing gym in Iowa where I trained.</v>

1001
00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:08.114
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1002
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And one was scary dude.</v>

1003
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:09.981
<v Speaker 1>He was scary.</v>

1004
00:25:09.981 --> 00:25:10.310
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>

1005
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:14.210
<v Speaker 1>he got side sidetracked and derailed by horrible management.</v>

1006
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.220
<v Speaker 1>They really screwed his,</v>

1007
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.031
<v Speaker 1>his career up.</v>

1008
00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:21.860
<v Speaker 1>But he was the scariest boxer that I have ever seen and been in the gym with.</v>

1009
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1010
00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:22.880
<v Speaker 1>that guy would,</v>

1011
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.080
<v Speaker 1>he's looking like he's punching at half speed and just crushing people was 16</v>

1012
00:25:27.081 --> 00:25:29.020
<v Speaker 1>ounce sparring gloves on destroying Pete.</v>

1013
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.460
<v Speaker 1>I remember Anton Antwan went down to,</v>

1014
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.080
<v Speaker 1>it was South America,</v>

1015
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Ecuador or wherever the hell it was.</v>

1016
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:36.800
<v Speaker 1>That was when,</v>

1017
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1018
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Norris was fighting</v>

1019
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Simon Brown,</v>

1020
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.343
<v Speaker 1>Terri,</v>

1021
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Terri,</v>

1022
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.963
<v Speaker 1>Terri Norris,</v>

1023
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.310
<v Speaker 1>the smaller one,</v>

1024
00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:46.551
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1025
00:25:46.551 --> 00:25:46.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1026
00:25:46.761 --> 00:25:47.390
<v Speaker 1>To turn,</v>

1027
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:47.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1028
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Michael Nunn was defending his title there and Antwan I'll has got on the card</v>

1029
00:25:52.641 --> 00:25:55.580
<v Speaker 1>because Michael Nunn was the pound for pound best fighter in the world.</v>

1030
00:25:55.581 --> 00:25:56.330
<v Speaker 1>He was out of Davenport.</v>

1031
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Iowa also were right.</v>

1032
00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.920
<v Speaker 1>So they were doing about your sparring and they were training down there,</v>

1033
00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:02.330
<v Speaker 1>getting used to the altitude and they,</v>

1034
00:26:02.331 --> 00:26:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Antwan one walked into the gym and he started sparring with three time world</v>

1035
00:26:05.301 --> 00:26:06.890
<v Speaker 1>champions and beating the shit out of all of them.</v>

1036
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:08.443
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

1037
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.021
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1038
00:26:09.021 --> 00:26:10.100
<v Speaker 1>you need to back off.</v>

1039
00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:10.670
<v Speaker 1>You need to,</v>

1040
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:11.540
<v Speaker 1>you need to stop this.</v>

1041
00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:13.550
<v Speaker 1>And it's a month out from the fight and he doesn't care.</v>

1042
00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:15.890
<v Speaker 1>He's knocking the shit out of all these three time world champs.</v>

1043
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:16.761
<v Speaker 1>And they'd go,</v>

1044
00:26:16.761 --> 00:26:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you're basically what Antoinne said to all of them was,</v>

1045
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:21.710
<v Speaker 1>if you guys can't handle it,</v>

1046
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:22.544
<v Speaker 1>stay out of my running.</v>

1047
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't care who you are or what your titles are.</v>

1048
00:26:25.851 --> 00:26:26.684
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to rescue,</v>

1049
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.250
<v Speaker 1>so toughen up.</v>

1050
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I own the ring now.</v>

1051
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1052
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.950
<v Speaker 1>That's how good he was.</v>

1053
00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.890
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about that kind of sparring though?</v>

1054
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.113
<v Speaker 1>I think it's great.</v>

1055
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's great to just go to war?</v>

1056
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.600
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1057
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:37.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1058
00:26:37.941 --> 00:26:38.251
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1059
00:26:38.251 --> 00:26:38.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1060
00:26:38.571 --> 00:26:39.770
<v Speaker 1>there has to be a limit obviously,</v>

1061
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.510
<v Speaker 1>because the ties don't do it like that at all.</v>

1062
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1063
00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:42.711
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing though.</v>

1064
00:26:42.711 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 1>That's because the low kicks and knees,</v>

1065
00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:44.941
<v Speaker 1>the elbows,</v>

1066
00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:45.750
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of stuff.</v>

1067
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 1>But it's also because they fight a lot,</v>

1068
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:47.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1069
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:47.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:48.414
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting every week,</v>

1071
00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:48.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.441
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

1073
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:49.891
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1074
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:50.101
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1075
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 1>you're smart.</v>

1076
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.481
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1077
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:53.100
<v Speaker 1>the thing is you can't,</v>

1078
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:54.480
<v Speaker 1>and I say it a million times,</v>

1079
00:26:54.481 --> 00:26:55.111
<v Speaker 1>I've said it for years.</v>

1080
00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:58.920
<v Speaker 1>You can't become a race car driver by going down the highway at 55 he's just</v>

1081
00:26:58.921 --> 00:26:59.850
<v Speaker 1>don't have the reaction time.</v>

1082
00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:00.970
<v Speaker 1>You're not used to that.</v>

1083
00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.760
<v Speaker 1>See Highspeed that high endurance,</v>

1084
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.110
<v Speaker 1>everything else that goes on,</v>

1085
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.680
<v Speaker 1>you have to get used to that and everything slows down eventually.</v>

1086
00:27:07.681 --> 00:27:07.891
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1087
00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:09.270
<v Speaker 1>With experience and time,</v>

1088
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:10.530
<v Speaker 1>things slow down for you.</v>

1089
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I can remember when I first started fighting kickboxing and everything was like</v>

1090
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.380
<v Speaker 1>a tunnel this big and all I could hear was me breathing.</v>

1091
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:17.563
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1092
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.673
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1093
00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:19.683
<v Speaker 1>Anything else.</v>

1094
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.540
<v Speaker 1>But then later on in my career,</v>

1095
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:22.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1096
00:27:22.861 --> 00:27:25.120
<v Speaker 1>you'd see punches come at you and you'd move this slow,</v>

1097
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.663
<v Speaker 1>but it was actually,</v>

1098
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:27.810
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1099
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:28.410
<v Speaker 1>So it just,</v>

1100
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.990
<v Speaker 1>it happens with time and you've experienced that with everything you've done,</v>

1101
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:31.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1102
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:35.400
<v Speaker 1>We come martial arts more accustomed to it and then you become more relaxed.</v>

1103
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.580
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder like is there a way to keep the speed but at least take something</v>

1104
00:27:41.011 --> 00:27:41.844
<v Speaker 1>off the shots.</v>

1105
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is where you put the shin pads on the head gear,</v>

1106
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.560
<v Speaker 1>the 16 ounce gloves,</v>

1107
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:47.460
<v Speaker 1>you'd go at high speed,</v>

1108
00:27:47.461 --> 00:27:48.121
<v Speaker 1>you go hard,</v>

1109
00:27:48.121 --> 00:27:49.170
<v Speaker 1>you hit takedowns hard,</v>

1110
00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:50.004
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of stuff,</v>

1111
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.990
<v Speaker 1>you know a couple of times a week.</v>

1112
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.361
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

1113
00:27:52.361 --> 00:27:52.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1114
00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:54.360
<v Speaker 1>you can't take that kind of punishment constantly.</v>

1115
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.800
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1116
00:27:55.801 --> 00:27:57.080
<v Speaker 1>mornings would be conditioning,</v>

1117
00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:57.901
<v Speaker 1>strength stuff,</v>

1118
00:27:57.901 --> 00:27:58.471
<v Speaker 1>technique,</v>

1119
00:27:58.471 --> 00:27:59.131
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of stuff.</v>

1120
00:27:59.131 --> 00:27:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Then the nighttime was,</v>

1121
00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:00.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1122
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.291
<v Speaker 1>more high speed,</v>

1123
00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:02.124
<v Speaker 1>hard takedowns.</v>

1124
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.380
<v Speaker 1>And as a coach I had to look and go,</v>

1125
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:04.770
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1126
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.880
<v Speaker 1>tonight's takedowns.</v>

1127
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.650
<v Speaker 1>But if I saw people getting tired,</v>

1128
00:28:07.651 --> 00:28:08.670
<v Speaker 1>fatigued and sloppy,</v>

1129
00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I knew an injury was about to happen.</v>

1130
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.681
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1131
00:28:10.681 --> 00:28:12.270
<v Speaker 1>let's go to the ground now getting the guard,</v>

1132
00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:13.090
<v Speaker 1>lets go from there.</v>

1133
00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Let's do,</v>

1134
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1135
00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 1>do some ground and pound drills,</v>

1136
00:28:15.031 --> 00:28:15.864
<v Speaker 1>this and that.</v>

1137
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:16.681
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

1138
00:28:16.681 --> 00:28:16.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1139
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.790
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1140
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:21.060
<v Speaker 1>it's important to go high speed until you start seeing mistakes happen because</v>

1141
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:22.320
<v Speaker 1>of sloppiness fatigue.</v>

1142
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.620
<v Speaker 1>That's when people get hurt.</v>

1143
00:28:23.621 --> 00:28:25.710
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got to pull the reigns back on everybody.</v>

1144
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.270
<v Speaker 1>When you were running your gym,</v>

1145
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.120
<v Speaker 1>the military fighting systems was the gym.</v>

1146
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys were the kings.</v>

1147
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.600
<v Speaker 1>You got to think about who came out at your gym.</v>

1148
00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:34.351
<v Speaker 1>Matt Hughes,</v>

1149
00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Robbie Lawler,</v>

1150
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean Jens Pulver,</v>

1151
00:28:37.351 --> 00:28:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Tim Silvia,</v>

1152
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.190
<v Speaker 1>and then a host of other killers that people just forgot.</v>

1153
00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:41.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1154
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.100
<v Speaker 1>we had a lot of people obviously that would come and train with us.</v>

1155
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:44.963
<v Speaker 1>Rich Franklin,</v>

1156
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:46.303
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1157
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Dave [inaudible] who was 85 pound champ for a while.</v>

1158
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:50.034
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

1159
00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.050
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the best martial artists I've ever seen.</v>

1160
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:53.520
<v Speaker 1>People don't even know about it.</v>

1161
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.700
<v Speaker 1>The guy was incredible trained with Greg Nelson for a good portion of his</v>

1162
00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:57.031
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

1163
00:28:57.031 --> 00:28:57.481
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

1164
00:28:57.481 --> 00:29:02.481
<v Speaker 1>but I think we had 92 people made it to televise careers and I think 30 or so I</v>

1165
00:29:02.911 --> 00:29:03.870
<v Speaker 1>made it to the UFC.</v>

1166
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:04.831
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty impressed.</v>

1167
00:29:04.831 --> 00:29:05.221
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1168
00:29:05.221 --> 00:29:05.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1169
00:29:05.551 --> 00:29:06.750
<v Speaker 1>when I added it all up,</v>

1170
00:29:06.751 --> 00:29:10.640
<v Speaker 1>somebody asked me to do that and I added it all up and I went through all the,</v>

1171
00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.640
<v Speaker 1>the televised cards and I remembered it was I think 92 people and I thought,</v>

1172
00:29:14.641 --> 00:29:16.500
<v Speaker 1>you know that it's pretty impressive.</v>

1173
00:29:16.501 --> 00:29:17.520
<v Speaker 1>We had a lot of killers.</v>

1174
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.450
<v Speaker 1>We had a lot of killers.</v>

1175
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:29:19.261 --> 00:29:22.740
<v Speaker 1>And you also were the first big Super Gym,</v>

1177
00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:23.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1178
00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:28.650
<v Speaker 1>You were the first big American gym that was producing like world champion</v>

1179
00:29:28.651 --> 00:29:29.760
<v Speaker 1>besides like the lions down.</v>

1180
00:29:29.761 --> 00:29:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's true.</v>

1181
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:32.100
<v Speaker 1>The lion's den too.</v>

1182
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:32.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1183
00:29:32.521 --> 00:29:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I guess they were the first we had to go.</v>

1184
00:29:33.941 --> 00:29:34.291

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.040
<v Speaker 1>We had a good rapport with the lion's den,</v>

1188
00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:40.050
<v Speaker 1>didn't produce as many world champions.</v>

1222
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:24.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1223
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:24.821
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1224
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:25.654
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy that uh,</v>

1225
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.090
<v Speaker 2>he suffered through that Vioxx Shit.</v>

1226
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:31.360
<v Speaker 2>You know that Vioxx stuff that people were taking for heart attacks and all</v>

1227
00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:31.630
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1228
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Stroke a stroke through Vioxx.</v>

1229
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:37.000
<v Speaker 2>They pulled that shit off the market and when people were taking it,</v>

1231
00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:38.500
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people were taking getting strokes.</v>

1232
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.350
<v Speaker 2>I think someone Vioxx and Celebrex,</v>

1233
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:42.571
<v Speaker 2>Celebrex and other ones.</v>

1234
00:30:42.571 --> 00:30:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Celebrex was bad too.</v>

1235
00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1236
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.590
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of weird drugs that people were taken for arthritis that I guess</v>

1237
00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:48.670
<v Speaker 2>it was like a blood thinner.</v>

1238
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:48.941
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1239
00:30:48.941 --> 00:30:49.774
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

1240
00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1241
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.620
<v Speaker 2>That was a lot of a lot of professional athletes who were suffering from</v>

1242
00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:55.690
<v Speaker 2>inflammation and pain and getting beat up and stuff.</v>

1243
00:30:55.691 --> 00:30:56.920
<v Speaker 2>We're all taking it and it was,</v>

1244
00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:57.101
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1245
00:30:57.101 --> 00:30:57.940
<v Speaker 2>it was wrecking people.</v>

1246
00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1247
00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1248
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.010
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

1249
00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:01.000
<v Speaker 2>but back to your gym,</v>

1250
00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.620
<v Speaker 2>like when you guys were doing it,</v>

1251
00:31:02.621 --> 00:31:05.080
<v Speaker 2>you guys were kind of creating the roadmap.</v>

1252
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:05.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1253
00:31:05.861 --> 00:31:07.270
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't really a lot.</v>

1254
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean the lines then had their crazy,</v>

1255
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1256
00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:11.281
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1257
00:31:11.281 --> 00:31:11.531
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1258
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:14.250
<v Speaker 2>the initiation that they would do right,</v>

1259
00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.210
<v Speaker 2>where they would run you through this and sync gauntlet.</v>

1260
00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1261
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.270
<v Speaker 2>It was similar to what I guess Ken had to go through in Japan,</v>

1262
00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.950
<v Speaker 2>but candidate put that together.</v>

1263
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:22.083
<v Speaker 2>They had,</v>

1264
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.100
<v Speaker 2>they had their own little methods as well.</v>

1265
00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:25.660
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say little methods.</v>

1266
00:31:25.661 --> 00:31:26.490
<v Speaker 2>They had their own food.</v>

1267
00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.060
<v Speaker 2>They were very big and very crazy,</v>

1268
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.670
<v Speaker 2>but you guys like there wasn't,</v>

1269
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:31.630
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't like,</v>

1270
00:31:31.631 --> 00:31:34.740
<v Speaker 2>now you have att have Tristar,</v>

1271
00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.420
<v Speaker 2>you have all these different gyms you could sort of model after,</v>

1272
00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:38.800
<v Speaker 2>you know Rufus is camp.</v>

1273
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.300
<v Speaker 2>There's all these different places we can say,</v>

1274
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:40.720
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1275
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.280
<v Speaker 2>all these elite fighters come out of here.</v>

1276
00:31:42.281 --> 00:31:43.210
<v Speaker 2>How are they doing it?</v>

1277
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:43.511
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1278
00:31:43.511 --> 00:31:44.620
<v Speaker 2>I've trained with these guys,</v>

1279
00:31:44.621 --> 00:31:47.290
<v Speaker 2>I know their methods and here's what they do for strength and conditioning.</v>

1280
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Here's how they take a here's how to do the recovery work.</v>

1281
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:53.080
<v Speaker 2>You guys were basically at the front of the line.</v>

1283
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.930
<v Speaker 2>There was nobody back there for you to look at.</v>

1284
00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1285
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.300
<v Speaker 2>what I was lucky enough to be,</v>

1286
00:31:58.301 --> 00:31:59.020
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1287
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't a world class restaurant.</v>

1288
00:32:00.451 --> 00:32:01.151
<v Speaker 2>It was a good Russell.</v>

1289
00:32:01.151 --> 00:32:02.320
<v Speaker 2>I beat some very good wrestlers,</v>

1290
00:32:02.321 --> 00:32:04.990
<v Speaker 2>but that was not by any means even remotely worldclass.</v>

1291
00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:05.843
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1292
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.290
<v Speaker 2>I had some boxing experience.</v>

1293
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.690
<v Speaker 2>I've been around some great boxers so I at least had that to start with.</v>

1294
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.610
<v Speaker 2>But I recognized,</v>

1295
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:13.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1296
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.440
<v Speaker 2>I want to be,</v>

1297
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:14.860
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

1298
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I want to be good enough to spar 12 rounds with a worldclass boxer and hang,</v>

1299
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.360
<v Speaker 2>hang and go an hour straight with a worldclass BJJ black belt and go back and</v>

1300
00:32:25.121 --> 00:32:28.180
<v Speaker 2>forth with them and battle tooth and nail to be able to hang in there.</v>

1301
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:28.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1302
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.270
<v Speaker 2>the eyewear wrestling room during the summer with the hot club guys who were</v>

1303
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:35.560
<v Speaker 2>absolute beast and frigging throw it around and bouncing off walls and spar with</v>

1304
00:32:35.561 --> 00:32:35.920
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

1305
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.950
<v Speaker 2>good kickboxers and be able to do all that stuff and then understand how the,</v>

1306
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 2>how to put it all together.</v>

1307
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.590
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that,</v>

1308
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1309
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:48.730
<v Speaker 1>at least enabled me to explain grappling and wrestling to a Stryker from Stryker</v>

1310
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 1>standpoint and vice versa.</v>

1311
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:51.560
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1312
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.680
<v Speaker 1>So that was understanding angles from a striking standpoint,</v>

1313
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.220
<v Speaker 1>from a wrestling standpoint and being able to explain it and understand people.</v>

1314
00:32:58.221 --> 00:33:00.110
<v Speaker 1>And then you got to read people,</v>

1315
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:00.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1316
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:00.930
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

1317
00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:01.790
<v Speaker 1>their personality,</v>

1318
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:02.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1319
00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.530
<v Speaker 1>You got to coach everybody different.</v>

1320
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:07.610
<v Speaker 1>You can't coach everybody the same way because some people want to get screamed</v>

1321
00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:09.920
<v Speaker 1>at and some people want a pat on the back of the hug.</v>

1322
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.581
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1323
00:33:10.581 --> 00:33:11.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just you got to read people differently.</v>

1324
00:33:11.961 --> 00:33:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Personalities are big deal.</v>

1325
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.200
<v Speaker 1>When you were putting together,</v>

1326
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:16.550
<v Speaker 1>when you were training fighters,</v>

1327
00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:17.211
<v Speaker 1>you first,</v>

1328
00:33:17.211 --> 00:33:18.200
<v Speaker 1>you started off,</v>

1329
00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:19.580
<v Speaker 1>when you first start doing it,</v>

1330
00:33:19.581 --> 00:33:23.510
<v Speaker 1>you were still fighting and you still had a couple of fights along the way.</v>

1331
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1332
00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.410
<v Speaker 1>But when you are putting together like training,</v>

1333
00:33:27.411 --> 00:33:29.990
<v Speaker 1>say if you were training fighter for a big fight in the UFC,</v>

1334
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.720
<v Speaker 1>how did you put together their camp?</v>

1335
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Did you leave it up to them in some ways?</v>

1336
00:33:35.451 --> 00:33:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Did you just have them attend the regular group training sessions?</v>

1337
00:33:39.111 --> 00:33:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Did you give them individualized attention?</v>

1338
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1339
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:41.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1340
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I would give them individual attention.</v>

1341
00:33:44.121 --> 00:33:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

1342
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.553
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

1343
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.450
<v Speaker 1>I had to kind of figure out,</v>

1344
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.160
<v Speaker 1>everybody's body was different.</v>

1345
00:33:49.161 --> 00:33:49.910
<v Speaker 1>How to find that,</v>

1346
00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:53.090
<v Speaker 1>that balance between aerobic and anaerobic endurance.</v>

1347
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:53.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1348
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.970
<v Speaker 1>some people needed more of one or the other.</v>

1349
00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1350
00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.330
<v Speaker 1>and then they'd come to team training and everybody,</v>

1351
00:33:59.390 --> 00:33:59.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1352
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:04.840
<v Speaker 1>you've got 40 guys in the room who are all a bunch of killers and you just get</v>

1353
00:34:05.061 --> 00:34:05.571
<v Speaker 1>new guys.</v>

1354
00:34:05.571 --> 00:34:08.150
<v Speaker 1>And everybody was pretty good about knowing this guy's getting ready for a</v>

1355
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:08.421
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1356
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Don't fucking hurting.</v>

1357
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:10.250
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1358
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:11.390
<v Speaker 1>that's really important,</v>

1359
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:12.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1360
00:34:12.141 --> 00:34:12.500
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1361
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.250
<v Speaker 1>so we were pretty good about as a group looking out for somebody but pushing</v>

1362
00:34:16.251 --> 00:34:18.410
<v Speaker 1>them to their limit constantly or double team.</v>

1363
00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:19.071
<v Speaker 1>And I'm constantly,</v>

1364
00:34:19.071 --> 00:34:19.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1365
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:22.760
<v Speaker 1>every minute of the new guy jumping in on I'm type stuff and doing that sort of,</v>

1366
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:23.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1367
00:34:23.031 --> 00:34:23.864
<v Speaker 1>so it was,</v>

1368
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1369
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:25.400
<v Speaker 1>and obviously,</v>

1370
00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:26.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1371
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:29.810
<v Speaker 1>helping a guy like Hughes who wasn't the best striker,</v>

1372
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.670
<v Speaker 1>we've got to do what we can to get them better at it,</v>

1373
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.593
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1374
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Or a striker who can't stop the take down.</v>

1375
00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.050
<v Speaker 1>We've got to figure out how to help this guy.</v>

1376
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I gotta put him with a bunch of wrestlers and just having constantly sprawling,</v>

1377
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.280
<v Speaker 1>sprawling and sprawling and guys would alternate and shoot and shoot and shoot</v>

1378
00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:44.810
<v Speaker 1>and make them work at work at work at,</v>

1379
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:45.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1380
00:34:45.411 --> 00:34:46.100
<v Speaker 1>that was the,</v>

1381
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.280
<v Speaker 1>it was just different for each guy I guess.</v>

1382
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Now did you,</v>

1383
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:53.300
<v Speaker 1>did you have anything specific that you would do in between camps?</v>

1384
00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you had a guy like cues and you say like he,</v>

1385
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:57.110
<v Speaker 1>he wins this fight,</v>

1386
00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.520
<v Speaker 1>now I have some time off.</v>

1387
00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Would you start working with them on specific things like you would you have a</v>

1388
00:35:02.931 --> 00:35:03.920
<v Speaker 1>program you'd say like,</v>

1389
00:35:03.921 --> 00:35:04.101
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

1390
00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:05.090
<v Speaker 1>we really got to tighten up,</v>

1391
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:05.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1392
00:35:05.361 --> 00:35:06.730
<v Speaker 1>your standup defense or we have,</v>

1393
00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:07.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1394
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:08.720
<v Speaker 1>if they were healthy and stuff like that.</v>

1395
00:35:08.721 --> 00:35:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1396
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:09.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1397
00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:10.100
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1398
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.450
<v Speaker 1>there was just guys that it's so hard for people to be well rounded.</v>

1399
00:35:14.451 --> 00:35:15.051
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

1400
00:35:15.051 --> 00:35:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're that good at one thing.</v>

1401
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Hughes was such a powerful wrestler that and so good on the ground that it was,</v>

1402
00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:23.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1403
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.410
<v Speaker 1>it was a challenge.</v>

1404
00:35:24.411 --> 00:35:26.960
<v Speaker 1>So we had to definitely work extra with that.</v>

1405
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:27.441
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1406
00:35:27.441 --> 00:35:32.441
<v Speaker 1>Matt was the first guy who was a really great wrestler who also was outstanding</v>

1407
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:33.210
<v Speaker 1>at submissions.</v>

1408
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1409
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.290
<v Speaker 1>He really changed the game because like,</v>

1410
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:37.260
<v Speaker 1>like when he,</v>

1411
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 1>that far</v>

1412
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.840
<v Speaker 3>side arm bar and George St Pierre,</v>

1413
00:35:39.841 --> 00:35:41.490
<v Speaker 3>it has a very tactical move.</v>

1414
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:45.990
<v Speaker 3>And to have a powerhouse wrestler hit that in a world title fight.</v>

1415
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like that to me,</v>

1416
00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:49.410
<v Speaker 3>I think Matt doesn't get enough credit.</v>

1417
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:49.921
<v Speaker 3>Maybe see,</v>

1418
00:35:49.921 --> 00:35:51.090
<v Speaker 3>just because you know,</v>

1419
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:53.340
<v Speaker 3>time passes and you start looking at George Saint Pierre,</v>

1420
00:35:53.341 --> 00:35:54.171
<v Speaker 3>he started looking at all,</v>

1421
00:35:54.171 --> 00:35:56.340
<v Speaker 3>all these other guys with would lose the champ now.</v>

1422
00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.360
<v Speaker 3>And you sorta just forget like that Matt was the blueprint.</v>

1423
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.880
<v Speaker 3>This is what happens when a really strong,</v>

1424
00:36:02.881 --> 00:36:05.690
<v Speaker 3>powerful wrestler absorbs the ground.</v>

1425
00:36:05.691 --> 00:36:06.350
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1426
00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:07.011
<v Speaker 1>Scary dude.</v>

1427
00:36:07.011 --> 00:36:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1428
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.641
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1429
00:36:07.641 --> 00:36:08.540
<v Speaker 1>that's where you go.</v>

1430
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:10.580
<v Speaker 1>You're not a Bjj guy.</v>

1431
00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:10.940
<v Speaker 1>You're a,</v>

1432
00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.170
<v Speaker 1>you're a catch as catch can.</v>

1433
00:36:12.171 --> 00:36:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Rustler right.</v>

1434
00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1435
00:36:13.161 --> 00:36:15.200
<v Speaker 1>you understand how to destroy somebody.</v>

1436
00:36:15.201 --> 00:36:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Control position,</v>

1437
00:36:16.041 --> 00:36:17.360
<v Speaker 1>beat 'em up and hit,</v>

1438
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:17.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1439
00:36:17.721 --> 00:36:18.590
<v Speaker 1>power submissions,</v>

1440
00:36:18.591 --> 00:36:19.371
<v Speaker 1>finesse submissions,</v>

1441
00:36:19.371 --> 00:36:19.651
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1442
00:36:19.651 --> 00:36:20.490
<v Speaker 1>all that different stuff.</v>

1443
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1444
00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:21.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1445
00:36:21.291 --> 00:36:22.124
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1446
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.941
<v Speaker 1>and when he was,</v>

1447
00:36:22.941 --> 00:36:23.721
<v Speaker 1>was in his prime,</v>

1448
00:36:23.721 --> 00:36:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he first,</v>

1449
00:36:24.861 --> 00:36:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I refereed his second fight and he destroyed some poor Brazilian and the guy was</v>

1450
00:36:29.481 --> 00:36:30.350
<v Speaker 1>a really good,</v>

1451
00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:34.580
<v Speaker 1>legit blackbelt and Hughes beat him half to death and it was in Chicago.</v>

1452
00:36:34.581 --> 00:36:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I refereed it and I walked up to me when I go,</v>

1453
00:36:36.711 --> 00:36:38.420
<v Speaker 1>did you ever come to Iowa?</v>

1454
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:39.950
<v Speaker 1>I know I'll make you a world champ.</v>

1455
00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.330
<v Speaker 1>There's just no doubt in my mind.</v>

1456
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:42.770
<v Speaker 1>That was the only guy I ever said that to.</v>

1457
00:36:42.771 --> 00:36:45.020
<v Speaker 1>The only guy I ever recruited to be honest with you,</v>

1458
00:36:45.021 --> 00:36:45.854
<v Speaker 1>for the most part.</v>

1459
00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:47.750
<v Speaker 1>So he shows up.</v>

1460
00:36:47.751 --> 00:36:49.640
<v Speaker 1>He drives three and a half hours from Hillsboro,</v>

1461
00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Illinois.</v>

1462
00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I've got bronchitis at the time,</v>

1463
00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.990
<v Speaker 1>which made it even worse.</v>

1464
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:55.483
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1465
00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:55.821
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>

1466
00:36:55.821 --> 00:36:56.654
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

1467
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:57.110
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

1468
00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.160
<v Speaker 1>let's get this workout in.</v>

1469
00:36:58.161 --> 00:36:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1470
00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.990
<v Speaker 1>So we wrestled and grappled,</v>

1471
00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:00.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1472
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.060
<v Speaker 1>takedowns to submissions,</v>

1473
00:37:02.061 --> 00:37:02.894
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

1474
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.810
<v Speaker 1>And about 30 minutes into it,</v>

1475
00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't breathe in.</v>

1476
00:37:07.081 --> 00:37:07.881
<v Speaker 1>This guy is a monster.</v>

1477
00:37:07.881 --> 00:37:10.700
<v Speaker 1>I've had even 50 submissions and he's shaken out to all of them.</v>

1478
00:37:10.701 --> 00:37:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Literally just like bounced me off the walls.</v>

1479
00:37:12.771 --> 00:37:13.910
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking strong.</v>

1480
00:37:13.911 --> 00:37:14.744
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it.</v>

1481
00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:15.530
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>

1482
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:16.251
<v Speaker 1>I was a strong guy.</v>

1483
00:37:16.251 --> 00:37:16.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1484
00:37:16.521 --> 00:37:21.080
<v Speaker 1>at the time I was probably mentioned three 65 could dunk a basketball and run a</v>

1485
00:37:21.081 --> 00:37:25.160
<v Speaker 1>four four 40 so I was not a slouch athlete when I was in my prime and I couldn't</v>

1486
00:37:25.161 --> 00:37:26.000
<v Speaker 1>believe this guy.</v>

1487
00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.540
<v Speaker 1>I had never experienced somebody my size being the strong in my life,</v>

1488
00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.160
<v Speaker 1>that it's armor strength,</v>

1489
00:37:31.161 --> 00:37:31.461
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1490
00:37:31.461 --> 00:37:32.060
<v Speaker 1>his roots,</v>

1491
00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:32.720
<v Speaker 1>it is real.</v>

1492
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.640
<v Speaker 1>And I grew up half the Russell farmers,</v>

1493
00:37:34.641 --> 00:37:35.300
<v Speaker 1>trust me,</v>

1494
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.230
<v Speaker 1>the Royce Alger is,</v>

1495
00:37:36.231 --> 00:37:37.160
<v Speaker 1>and although Sundance,</v>

1496
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:37.491
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1497
00:37:37.491 --> 00:37:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1498
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:39.140
<v Speaker 1>But I said to him,</v>

1499
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.251
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1500
00:37:40.251 --> 00:37:40.820
<v Speaker 1>hold on man.</v>

1501
00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:41.001
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1502
00:37:41.001 --> 00:37:41.571
<v Speaker 1>I can't breathe.</v>

1503
00:37:41.571 --> 00:37:42.291
<v Speaker 1>I got bronchitis.</v>

1504
00:37:42.291 --> 00:37:42.950
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1505
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:43.783
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

1506
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.241
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1507
00:37:44.241 --> 00:37:44.931
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you got.</v>

1508
00:37:44.931 --> 00:37:46.070
<v Speaker 1>And I drove three and a half hours,</v>

1509
00:37:46.071 --> 00:37:46.701
<v Speaker 1>we're working out.</v>

1510
00:37:46.701 --> 00:37:51.170
<v Speaker 1>And he grabbed me and fucking train doubled me onto my back all the way across</v>

1511
00:37:51.171 --> 00:37:52.020
<v Speaker 1>the room slams.</v>

1512
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:52.780
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1513
00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.330
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1514
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:53.811
<v Speaker 1>we're here,</v>

1515
00:37:53.811 --> 00:37:54.560
<v Speaker 1>let's get it done.</v>

1516
00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.150
<v Speaker 1>So I got him in one guillotine.</v>

1517
00:37:56.151 --> 00:37:57.260
<v Speaker 1>I lifted him off its feet.</v>

1518
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I ran him backwards.</v>

1519
00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.830
<v Speaker 1>And Randy was hard as I could ask first end of the wall.</v>

1520
00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:01.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1521
00:38:01.471 --> 00:38:01.760
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

1522
00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.570
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to kill him.</v>

1523
00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:06.830
<v Speaker 1>I was so pissed because he is just a freak and he went limp.</v>

1524
00:38:06.831 --> 00:38:08.150
<v Speaker 1>He went unconscious for a second.</v>

1525
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.070
<v Speaker 1>So I let go of it and he slid down the wall,</v>

1526
00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:10.731
<v Speaker 1>hit his knees,</v>

1527
00:38:10.731 --> 00:38:11.730
<v Speaker 1>woke back up and train,</v>

1528
00:38:11.731 --> 00:38:13.670
<v Speaker 1>doubled me again onto my back and went back at it.</v>

1529
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.863
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1530
00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.190
<v Speaker 1>So we get done,</v>

1531
00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.100
<v Speaker 1>we get done with this hour or something,</v>

1532
00:38:18.101 --> 00:38:19.760
<v Speaker 1>work out of just go,</v>

1533
00:38:19.761 --> 00:38:19.971
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1534
00:38:19.971 --> 00:38:20.600
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1535
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.560
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at him and I go,</v>

1536
00:38:21.561 --> 00:38:22.010
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1537
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.843
<v Speaker 1>what do you on?</v>

1538
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.721
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1539
00:38:23.721 --> 00:38:24.554
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

1540
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1541
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:29.210
<v Speaker 1>what are you taking you on some fucking steroids or what?</v>

1542
00:38:29.211 --> 00:38:30.044
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1543
00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:30.891
<v Speaker 1>and he got pissed.</v>

1544
00:38:30.891 --> 00:38:31.281
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1545
00:38:31.281 --> 00:38:32.810
<v Speaker 1>don't ever accuse me of that again.</v>

1546
00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:33.321
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1547
00:38:33.321 --> 00:38:34.154
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

1548
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:34.581
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1549
00:38:34.581 --> 00:38:35.500
<v Speaker 1>don't ever say again.</v>

1550
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

1551
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:40.180
<v Speaker 1>That was like the one thing where if somebody said to anything like that,</v>

1552
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 1>he was so offended because he was just a farm boy.</v>

1553
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:44.530
<v Speaker 1>His brother was frigging just as strong if not stronger.</v>

1554
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:44.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1555
00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:46.240
<v Speaker 1>His brother was a gorilla too.</v>

1556
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.010
<v Speaker 1>And his brother fought in UFC wants,</v>

1557
00:38:48.011 --> 00:38:48.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1558
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1559
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.400
<v Speaker 1>And walking back to the locker room after that fight,</v>

1560
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:52.330
<v Speaker 1>his brother mark goes,</v>

1561
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.370
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't really all I expected.</v>

1562
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

1563
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:56.831
<v Speaker 1>it was fun,</v>

1564
00:38:56.831 --> 00:38:58.000
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think I'm,</v>

1565
00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:58.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm going to,</v>

1566
00:38:58.991 --> 00:39:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't enjoy that that much.</v>

1567
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:01.541
<v Speaker 1>And he killed the guy.</v>

1568
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:02.374
<v Speaker 1>He beat the shit out of it.</v>

1569
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1570
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1571
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.210
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1572
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:04.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1573
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean even identical twins,</v>

1574
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.530
<v Speaker 1>they don't necessarily think identically.</v>

1575
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1576
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1577
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1578
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:09.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1579
00:39:09.851 --> 00:39:10.684
<v Speaker 1>Matt was a,</v>

1580
00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:15.280
<v Speaker 1>he was a real freak and a real important figure in the history of MMA,</v>

1581
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:15.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1582
00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:16.100
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1583
00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.330
<v Speaker 1>cause you gotta think 1993 it all starts.</v>

1584
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.450
<v Speaker 1>And then from then on it's been sort of this learning experience,</v>

1585
00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:24.310
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what works and what doesn't work.</v>

1586
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:25.390
<v Speaker 1>And in my opinion,</v>

1587
00:39:25.391 --> 00:39:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Matt is one of the big pieces to that puzzle because we had had some powerful</v>

1588
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:30.761
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers of course,</v>

1589
00:39:30.761 --> 00:39:32.680
<v Speaker 1>yet Coleman and so many other guys.</v>

1590
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:34.900
<v Speaker 1>And they were basically all about ground and pound.</v>

1591
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:35.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1592
00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:36.750
<v Speaker 1>the only time Coleman got a submission,</v>

1593
00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:37.840
<v Speaker 1>the UFC was when he,</v>

1594
00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.370
<v Speaker 1>he fucking headlock Dan Severen or can't open,</v>

1595
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.700
<v Speaker 1>take the lag in the head,</v>

1596
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.650
<v Speaker 1>the head go head lock.</v>

1597
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:47.830
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to eat something like that.</v>

1598
00:39:47.831 --> 00:39:48.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1599
00:39:48.071 --> 00:39:49.360
<v Speaker 1>It was like a judo star.</v>

1600
00:39:49.361 --> 00:39:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Pressor a compressor.</v>

1601
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1602
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1603
00:39:51.251 --> 00:39:51.491
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1604
00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:54.250
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to get stuck and that would that fuck a gorilla back then.</v>

1605
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.190
<v Speaker 1>He was ungodly strong when I trained him for the pride Grand Prix,</v>

1606
00:39:57.191 --> 00:39:57.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1607
00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1608
00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.680
<v Speaker 1>He called me up and he goes,</v>

1609
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I want to come there and train with you.</v>

1610
00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:03.250
<v Speaker 1>And He'd lost two or three fights in a row at that point.</v>

1611
00:40:03.251 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 1>So he was kind of cannon fodder put into that pride Grand Prix.</v>

1612
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.390
<v Speaker 1>He was just a name at that point.</v>

1613
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.501
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

1614
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:08.980
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1615
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.491
<v Speaker 1>come you,</v>

1616
00:40:09.491 --> 00:40:09.911
<v Speaker 1>come here,</v>

1617
00:40:09.911 --> 00:40:11.140
<v Speaker 1>you got to do everything I tell you to do.</v>

1618
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:11.530
<v Speaker 1>We're going to,</v>

1619
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:12.311
<v Speaker 1>we're going to train hard.</v>

1620
00:40:12.311 --> 00:40:12.581
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

1621
00:40:12.581 --> 00:40:13.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to torture you.</v>

1622
00:40:13.311 --> 00:40:13.371
<v Speaker 1>Got,</v>

1623
00:40:13.371 --> 00:40:13.780
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>

1624
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:14.613
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

1625
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:15.850
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

1626
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.440
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to come there.</v>

1627
00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I think because I had so many scary dudes at the time,</v>

1628
00:40:19.811 --> 00:40:21.520
<v Speaker 1>like Steve Ross who wasn't even a fighter,</v>

1629
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.650
<v Speaker 1>could kill every fighter I've ever train.</v>

1630
00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:24.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1631
00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:25.120
<v Speaker 1>he'd just walk in the room,</v>

1632
00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:27.370
<v Speaker 1>take off his fatigues from hunting,</v>

1633
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.760
<v Speaker 1>beat the shit out of everybody in the room and then go back out hunting or</v>

1634
00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:31.210
<v Speaker 1>fishing.</v>

1635
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:31.751
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>

1636
00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:32.230
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1637
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.880
<v Speaker 1>that was Steve Ross and he didn't fight.</v>

1638
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.350
<v Speaker 1>He fought four times and just goes,</v>

1639
00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:37.060
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1640
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1641
00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1642
00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into it,</v>

1643
00:40:39.191 --> 00:40:40.930
<v Speaker 1>but I'll come into the gym and help everybody get ready.</v>

1644
00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:41.470
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1645
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.090
<v Speaker 1>he helped me coach my IFL team,</v>

1646
00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.690
<v Speaker 1>but he was the guy that after I fought Lindland,</v>

1647
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:48.250
<v Speaker 1>when I got kicked out of my weight division,</v>

1648
00:40:48.251 --> 00:40:49.120
<v Speaker 1>when the UFC goes,</v>

1649
00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.950
<v Speaker 1>you gotta move up weight division.</v>

1650
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:51.783
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

1651
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.290
<v Speaker 1>why did they tell you you have to move up?</v>

1652
00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:53.771
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

1653
00:40:53.771 --> 00:40:56.170
<v Speaker 1>you've trained yourself out of a spot.</v>

1654
00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.110
<v Speaker 1>You have Jason Black,</v>

1655
00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.860
<v Speaker 1>rob Lawler and Matt Hughes all at one 70 they're all ranked,</v>

1656
00:41:02.861 --> 00:41:04.150
<v Speaker 1>I think in the s at the time,</v>

1657
00:41:04.151 --> 00:41:05.170
<v Speaker 1>top 10 in the world.</v>

1658
00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:06.363
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

1659
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.271
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

1660
00:41:07.271 --> 00:41:09.940
<v Speaker 1>I had done my comeback fight after losing the title,</v>

1661
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Carlos knocked out Shonie Carter.</v>

1662
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.100
<v Speaker 1>So in my contract it said that I have an automatic rematch clause.</v>

1663
00:41:15.101 --> 00:41:15.934
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1664
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:16.930
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

1665
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:17.260
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

1666
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.040
<v Speaker 1>not happening.</v>

1667
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.450
<v Speaker 1>You're moving up to one 85 and I go,</v>

1668
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not big enough for one 85 right.</v>

1669
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.290
<v Speaker 1>But I realized at that point,</v>

1670
00:41:23.291 --> 00:41:26.620
<v Speaker 1>business wise how easily I could be discarded.</v>

1671
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1672
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:28.180
<v Speaker 1>And it Kinda,</v>

1673
00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.460
<v Speaker 1>it kinda ruined me to be honest with you mentally.</v>

1674
00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:30.850
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

1675
00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:31.181
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1676
00:41:31.181 --> 00:41:31.271
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1677
00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I think I want to do this.</v>

1678
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.280
<v Speaker 1>But neither here nor there.</v>

1679
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Lindland after we fought,</v>

1680
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:40.510
<v Speaker 1>he came to my gym to train for one of his fights and Steve Rusk is there that</v>

1681
00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 1>day and rusk was a great Greco guy and now it's the Olympic silver medalist,</v>

1682
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Greco guy going against a guy that's an unknown and Rusk ragdolls and we're</v>

1683
00:41:50.301 --> 00:41:54.500
<v Speaker 1>doing winner stays on the mat and Lynn Lynn gets taken down and linen won't</v>

1684
00:41:54.501 --> 00:41:55.130
<v Speaker 1>leave the mat.</v>

1685
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.470
<v Speaker 1>He can't believe he's getting taken down by a known name.</v>

1686
00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1687
00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.630
<v Speaker 1>So Russ does it to him again.</v>

1688
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:00.493
<v Speaker 1>It does it to him again.</v>

1689
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.340
<v Speaker 1>That was a tune him again.</v>

1690
00:42:01.341 --> 00:42:02.540
<v Speaker 1>And finally the whole team goes,</v>

1691
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Lindland get off the mat,</v>

1692
00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:04.640
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1693
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck out.</v>

1694
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1695
00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Linen comes over and sits next to me.</v>

1696
00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:07.940
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1697
00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.170
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck is that guy?</v>

1698
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.141
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1699
00:42:10.141 --> 00:42:11.030
<v Speaker 1>let's Steve Ross.</v>

1700
00:42:11.031 --> 00:42:12.190
<v Speaker 1>He's just these,</v>

1701
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Steve,</v>

1702
00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.450
<v Speaker 1>he's just everybody.</v>

1703
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:17.600
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those guys in gyms out there that don't want to fight with their super</v>

1704
00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:18.290
<v Speaker 1>high level.</v>

1705
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Danaher was telling me about some guys that he has in his gym that wreck some of</v>

1706
00:42:22.191 --> 00:42:24.200
<v Speaker 1>his best top guys that go in competition.</v>

1707
00:42:24.201 --> 00:42:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1708
00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1709
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:25.191
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1710
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:27.890
<v Speaker 1>rusk was a guy who he grabbed,</v>

1711
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.700
<v Speaker 1>it was Dave Strauser who fought in the UFC for awhile.</v>

1712
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.750
<v Speaker 1>They was a tough guy.</v>

1713
00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:32.630
<v Speaker 1>It was very tough.</v>

1714
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.220
<v Speaker 1>But Russ grabbed the,</v>

1715
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:35.203
<v Speaker 1>he was in,</v>

1716
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.053
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1717
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Dave's guard and he grabbed his foot and his shin bone and went like,</v>

1718
00:42:39.171 --> 00:42:40.730
<v Speaker 1>this one was going to just break his foot off.</v>

1719
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.211
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1720
00:42:41.211 --> 00:42:42.200
<v Speaker 1>That's how strong this guy was.</v>

1721
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.720
<v Speaker 1>And Strausser taps out.</v>

1722
00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.640
<v Speaker 1>It gets up and looking at him like,</v>

1723
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.820
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I'm ever grappling with you again.</v>

1724
00:42:49.821 --> 00:42:50.031
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1725
00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:50.811
<v Speaker 1>stay away from me.</v>

1726
00:42:50.811 --> 00:42:53.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't want any part of you ever again.</v>

1727
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1728
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:54.741
<v Speaker 1>Nick Ackerman,</v>

1729
00:42:54.741 --> 00:42:56.480
<v Speaker 1>who was a national champion wrestler,</v>

1730
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:59.330
<v Speaker 1>he won the hodge trophy the same year.</v>

1731
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Cael Sanderson the one they,</v>

1732
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:01.520
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

1733
00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.353
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1734
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.320
<v Speaker 1>co recipients of it.</v>

1735
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.170
<v Speaker 1>And that Ackerman was the guy who was a national champ who had,</v>

1736
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:10.640
<v Speaker 1>his legs were gone from his knees down and Ackerman was almost as tall as me on</v>

1737
00:43:10.641 --> 00:43:11.210
<v Speaker 1>his knees.</v>

1738
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:15.050
<v Speaker 1>That was another guy in our gym that was so strong that he would just,</v>

1739
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:17.350
<v Speaker 1>he could just crush your ribs by squeezing it.</v>

1740
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Just massive,</v>

1741
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:19.483
<v Speaker 1>massive power.</v>

1742
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:20.930
<v Speaker 1>It makes you wonder like,</v>

1743
00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:24.770
<v Speaker 1>what would it be like to grapple Carolyn when he's in his prime?</v>

1744
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Cause even the great grapplers would grapple him and go,</v>

1745
00:43:28.641 --> 00:43:30.470
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is that all about?</v>

1746
00:43:30.471 --> 00:43:30.850
<v Speaker 1>He would,</v>

1747
00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:31.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1748
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.020
<v Speaker 1>he was gut wrenching people and snap and spines.</v>

1749
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Literally snap and spines.</v>

1750
00:43:34.821 --> 00:43:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Like when guys would flatten out,</v>

1751
00:43:36.651 --> 00:43:39.020
<v Speaker 1>when you'd see a 290 pound man panic,</v>

1752
00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.000
<v Speaker 1>like lay down flat on his stomach,</v>

1753
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:44.600
<v Speaker 1>try to flatten out and do everything they can to keep from getting launched and</v>

1754
00:43:44.601 --> 00:43:49.020
<v Speaker 1>he would pick them up like a half empty sack of potatoes and a fucking slam the</v>

1755
00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

1756
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.340
<v Speaker 1>You ever see his parents know?</v>

1757
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Tiny little people.</v>

1758
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1759
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1760
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.720
<v Speaker 1>They called them the experiment where they gym gymnast.</v>

1761
00:43:56.721 --> 00:43:59.960
<v Speaker 1>One was a gymnast or something and the other one was a little power lifter or</v>

1762
00:43:59.961 --> 00:44:00.410
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1763
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1764
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

1765
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:01.941
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

1766
00:44:01.941 --> 00:44:02.721
<v Speaker 1>But they were like five,</v>

1767
00:44:02.721 --> 00:44:03.290
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

1768
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1769
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:04.311
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1770
00:44:04.311 --> 00:44:04.881
<v Speaker 1>you see him,</v>

1771
00:44:04.881 --> 00:44:06.980
<v Speaker 1>he was just this fucking giant panther.</v>

1772
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.930
<v Speaker 1>He really was like a panther.</v>

1773
00:44:08.931 --> 00:44:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Like he didn't,</v>

1774
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:11.420
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even move like a big guy.</v>

1775
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:13.040
<v Speaker 1>He moves like a small guy.</v>

1776
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1777
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:14.750
<v Speaker 1>And he was a giant.</v>

1778
00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1779
00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1780
00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.450
<v Speaker 1>there was probably some,</v>

1781
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:19.610
<v Speaker 1>some sort of beat the system with that.</v>

1782
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1783
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.150
<v Speaker 1>what beaten the system that was a part of this system.</v>

1784
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:25.010
<v Speaker 1>That fucking guy was on everything.</v>

1785
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.750
<v Speaker 1>100% when you look at his face,</v>

1786
00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:31.010
<v Speaker 1>his forehead came forward and everything just looked massive amounts of growth,</v>

1787
00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of stuff.</v>

1788
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Probably had them on growth and he was a little baby.</v>

1789
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1790
00:44:34.621 --> 00:44:37.630
<v Speaker 1>they'd probably just shot him up with growth from the time he was little.</v>

1791
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:38.550
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>

1792
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:39.630
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking terrifying.</v>

1793
00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:41.760
<v Speaker 1>But look what they're doing right now in China.</v>

1794
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:42.271
<v Speaker 1>There he is.</v>

1795
00:44:42.271 --> 00:44:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Here's Carolyn in his prime,</v>

1796
00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:45.290
<v Speaker 1>like picking up a massive,</v>

1797
00:44:45.291 --> 00:44:45.691
<v Speaker 1>massive,</v>

1798
00:44:45.691 --> 00:44:46.471
<v Speaker 1>massive man.</v>

1799
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:47.970
<v Speaker 1>This guys battle it to look at this.</v>

1800
00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:48.853
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1801
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean that guy,</v>

1802
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:56.550
<v Speaker 1>that giant dude on the bottom probably never had anybody rag Tom like that</v>

1803
00:44:56.551 --> 00:44:57.384
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1804
00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.170
<v Speaker 1>And it was also like the way he would work out when you see like some of the</v>

1805
00:45:01.171 --> 00:45:02.220
<v Speaker 1>shit that he would do,</v>

1806
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:06.840
<v Speaker 1>like some of his kettle bell workouts and shield cast that he would do with club</v>

1807
00:45:06.841 --> 00:45:09.150
<v Speaker 1>bells and steel plates and shit.</v>

1808
00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:10.470
<v Speaker 1>He was all about movement,</v>

1809
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:11.490
<v Speaker 1>circular,</v>

1810
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:16.490
<v Speaker 1>circular motions like so your gym having all that true functional fit,</v>

1811
00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:18.930
<v Speaker 1>like to see Indian clubs in your jam.</v>

1812
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

1813
00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:19.891
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1814
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:20.724
<v Speaker 1>he gets it.</v>

1815
00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.661
<v Speaker 1>He really gets it.</v>

1816
00:45:21.661 --> 00:45:22.261
<v Speaker 1>Indian clubs,</v>

1817
00:45:22.261 --> 00:45:23.610
<v Speaker 1>I collect all the old ones.</v>

1818
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1819
00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:25.350
<v Speaker 1>And team woodlands,</v>

1820
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.030
<v Speaker 1>the huge wood ones,</v>

1821
00:45:27.031 --> 00:45:27.630
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1822
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:28.411
<v Speaker 1>All that sort of stuff.</v>

1823
00:45:28.411 --> 00:45:33.000
<v Speaker 1>So a guy named Ed Thomas taught me about true functional fitness long before any</v>

1824
00:45:33.001 --> 00:45:35.040
<v Speaker 1>of this crossfit crap and all this stuff came out,</v>

1825
00:45:35.041 --> 00:45:35.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1826
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.780
<v Speaker 1>So Ed Thomas,</v>

1827
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Dr Ed Thomas,</v>

1828
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:39.240
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't know he was a doctor.</v>

1829
00:45:39.241 --> 00:45:40.650
<v Speaker 1>He just showed up at my gym one day.</v>

1830
00:45:40.651 --> 00:45:43.710
<v Speaker 1>He walks in a little unassuming dude and he goes,</v>

1831
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:44.401
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1832
00:45:44.401 --> 00:45:45.330
<v Speaker 1>he goes patio Simon,</v>

1833
00:45:45.331 --> 00:45:45.871
<v Speaker 1>Ed Thomas.</v>

1834
00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:46.704
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1835
00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:48.900
<v Speaker 1>do you have time for me to teach you some stuff?</v>

1836
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:49.943
<v Speaker 1>And when I went,</v>

1837
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:50.750
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

1838
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:51.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1839
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was the middle of the day,</v>

1840
00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.130
<v Speaker 1>nothing was going on.</v>

1841
00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.230
<v Speaker 1>So he brings in Indian clubs,</v>

1842
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:56.190
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells,</v>

1843
00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:57.870
<v Speaker 1>old med medicine balls,</v>

1844
00:45:57.871 --> 00:45:58.830
<v Speaker 1>old leather stuff.</v>

1845
00:45:58.831 --> 00:45:59.820
<v Speaker 1>And I at the time,</v>

1846
00:45:59.821 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 1>never seen any of this stuff.</v>

1847
00:46:00.871 --> 00:46:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know anything about it.</v>

1848
00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:02.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1849
00:46:02.251 --> 00:46:04.350
<v Speaker 1>he was raised in the Turner halls in Davenport,</v>

1850
00:46:04.351 --> 00:46:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Iowa,</v>

1851
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.680
<v Speaker 1>and that's where he learned functional fitness on the Turner Halls were brought</v>

1852
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:09.020
<v Speaker 1>by the Germans here because the,</v>

1853
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.410
<v Speaker 1>the German Jews,</v>

1854
00:46:10.411 --> 00:46:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Turner halls back in Germany to train a generation to become warriors,</v>

1855
00:46:14.161 --> 00:46:14.994
<v Speaker 1>to protect the nation.</v>

1856
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:16.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's where that mentality came from.</v>

1857
00:46:16.741 --> 00:46:18.420
<v Speaker 1>So everything they did was cargo nets,</v>

1858
00:46:18.421 --> 00:46:19.201
<v Speaker 1>pommel horses,</v>

1859
00:46:19.201 --> 00:46:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Indian clubs,</v>

1860
00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:20.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1861
00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.780
<v Speaker 1>heavy kettle bells,</v>

1862
00:46:21.781 --> 00:46:23.760
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of crazy just functional fitness stuff.</v>

1863
00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:25.050
<v Speaker 1>They would climb cargo nets,</v>

1864
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:26.870
<v Speaker 1>serpentine and signed of them.</v>

1865
00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1866
00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:30.960
<v Speaker 1>they would swing the cargo nets and the kids would Serpentini in and out of them</v>

1867
00:46:30.961 --> 00:46:31.830
<v Speaker 1>as it was swinging.</v>

1868
00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.030
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of crazy stuff.</v>

1869
00:46:33.031 --> 00:46:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1870
00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1871
00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:37.230
<v Speaker 1>definitely the rings that were doing a lot of the rings stuff and power,</v>

1872
00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:37.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1873
00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:38.820
<v Speaker 1>being able to do iron crosses,</v>

1874
00:46:38.821 --> 00:46:39.654
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of stuff.</v>

1875
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the way they raised their kids.</v>

1876
00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.350
<v Speaker 1>And so he was at the time,</v>

1877
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it's still is one of the first and foremost guys on functional fitness.</v>

1878
00:46:46.891 --> 00:46:49.260
<v Speaker 1>He was the guy that taught me how to train upside down with gravity boots,</v>

1879
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:53.850
<v Speaker 1>doing all kinds of crazy stuff with medicine balls and kettle bells and bands</v>

1880
00:46:53.851 --> 00:46:55.440
<v Speaker 1>and everything else you could do standing up,</v>

1881
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:56.640
<v Speaker 1>you could do upside down.</v>

1882
00:46:56.641 --> 00:46:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And he rebuilt me at the time,</v>

1883
00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 1>but he came in,</v>

1884
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:01.800
<v Speaker 1>taught me for an hour.</v>

1885
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:02.101
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1886
00:47:02.101 --> 00:47:03.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave this equipment here with Ya.</v>

1887
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.200
<v Speaker 1>You can teach your guys what I taught you and I'll come back another time.</v>

1888
00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:08.461
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1889
00:47:08.461 --> 00:47:08.641
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1890
00:47:08.641 --> 00:47:09.720
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking for a second.</v>

1891
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I got on the phone and I turned around.</v>

1892
00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:11.960
<v Speaker 1>He was gone.</v>

1893
00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Well he said he was a three times in Vietnam.</v>

1894
00:47:16.081 --> 00:47:16.914
<v Speaker 1>He was a tunnel rat.</v>

1895
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.570
<v Speaker 1>He signed up for extra tours.</v>

1896
00:47:18.571 --> 00:47:19.740
<v Speaker 1>He would go in and kill the Vietcong,</v>

1897
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.130
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>

1898
00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.240
<v Speaker 1>sleep amongst the bodies,</v>

1899
00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:24.600
<v Speaker 1>and then go back out and find another tunnel and kill people again.</v>

1900
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:25.321
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're going for.</v>

1901
00:47:25.321 --> 00:47:25.771
<v Speaker 1>Three years.</v>

1902
00:47:25.771 --> 00:47:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Just hardcore guy.</v>

1903
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 1>But I'm the guy that owned times at,</v>

1904
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:30.791
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>

1905
00:47:30.791 --> 00:47:33.190
<v Speaker 1>his kid was trained and underneath me and he goes,</v>

1906
00:47:33.191 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 1>I heard you met a friend of mine.</v>

1907
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:34.871
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

1908
00:47:34.871 --> 00:47:35.211
<v Speaker 1>who's that?</v>

1909
00:47:35.211 --> 00:47:35.501
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1910
00:47:35.501 --> 00:47:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Ed Thomas.</v>

1911
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:36.911
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

1912
00:47:36.911 --> 00:47:37.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1913
00:47:37.061 --> 00:47:37.990
<v Speaker 1>he didn't say he was a doctor,</v>

1914
00:47:37.991 --> 00:47:40.690
<v Speaker 1>but I could tell he was one of the most intelligent people I've ever met in my</v>

1915
00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:41.524
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1916
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:41.951
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1917
00:47:41.951 --> 00:47:42.131
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1918
00:47:42.131 --> 00:47:42.310
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1919
00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:43.090
<v Speaker 1>he's a scholar.</v>

1920
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:43.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1921
00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:45.340
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a warrior genius,</v>

1922
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:46.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1923
00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

1924
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:47.343
<v Speaker 1>And he's still,</v>

1925
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:48.220
<v Speaker 1>he's still up in De Moines,</v>

1926
00:47:48.221 --> 00:47:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Iowa.</v>

1927
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Haven't talked to him for a few years,</v>

1928
00:47:50.291 --> 00:47:53.380
<v Speaker 1>but that guy taught me what real fitness was about.</v>

1929
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.293
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1930
00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:55.661
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1931
00:47:55.661 --> 00:47:56.494
<v Speaker 1>what year was this,</v>

1932
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Dear God,</v>

1933
00:47:58.330 --> 00:47:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

1934
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I've been having to head so much or whatever.</v>

1935
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:00.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1936
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Now you're great for a guy who's been hitting add as many as you,</v>

1937
00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.170
<v Speaker 1>but I never had a concussion.</v>

1938
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.480
<v Speaker 1>I will say that we must have never had a concussion.</v>

1939
00:48:07.481 --> 00:48:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1940
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1941
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:08.881
<v Speaker 1>But what is it?</v>

1942
00:48:08.881 --> 00:48:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Concussion.</v>

1943
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Concussion is like,</v>

1944
00:48:10.571 --> 00:48:10.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1945
00:48:10.691 --> 00:48:11.890
<v Speaker 1>they check your pupils.</v>

1946
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:13.450
<v Speaker 1>They're not dialing directly.</v>

1947
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.313
<v Speaker 1>None of it.</v>

1948
00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:14.861
<v Speaker 1>None of them.</v>

1949
00:48:14.861 --> 00:48:16.000
<v Speaker 1>No concussions and all,</v>

1950
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.200
<v Speaker 1>all that hard sparring.</v>

1951
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1952
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

1953
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:19.280
<v Speaker 1>I find that hard to believe it.</v>

1954
00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.280
<v Speaker 1>He never got hit with a shot that they didn't see coming.</v>

1955
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:22.653
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>

1956
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:23.650
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

1957
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1958
00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1959
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Besides one time in a huge fight where a dude hit me in the side of the head</v>

1960
00:48:27.281 --> 00:48:27.761
<v Speaker 1>with a brick,</v>

1961
00:48:27.761 --> 00:48:28.810
<v Speaker 1>and I saw it last second,</v>

1962
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I at least rolled with it.</v>

1963
00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:31.540
<v Speaker 1>And that didn't give you a concussion?</v>

1964
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.090
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1965
00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1966
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:32.981
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1967
00:48:32.981 --> 00:48:33.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1968
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:34.540
<v Speaker 1>it was a huge bro.</v>

1969
00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:35.910
<v Speaker 1>It was hip hop night at the nightclub.</v>

1970
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I was bouncing that,</v>

1971
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:36.881
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1972
00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:37.714
<v Speaker 1>sounds like fun.</v>

1973
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:42.370
<v Speaker 1>And the head and the Illinois Gang bangers and the Iowa gangbangers started</v>

1974
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:45.100
<v Speaker 1>going at it and I tried breaking it up and they all attacked me.</v>

1975
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1976
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

1977
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:47.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's when I,</v>

1978
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.951
<v Speaker 1>everybody was wearing,</v>

1979
00:48:47.951 --> 00:48:48.671
<v Speaker 1>it was winter time.</v>

1980
00:48:48.671 --> 00:48:49.780
<v Speaker 1>So I was choking people.</v>

1981
00:48:49.781 --> 00:48:52.750
<v Speaker 1>A guy got me in a headlock and I was grabbing people by their coat lapels.</v>

1982
00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:55.660
<v Speaker 1>And I'd hit my head in between his head and his head and I'd choke him</v>

1983
00:48:55.661 --> 00:48:56.171
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

1984
00:48:56.171 --> 00:49:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I'd find a new coat and I was working my way backwards out the front door and</v>

1985
00:49:00.011 --> 00:49:01.360
<v Speaker 1>finally snuck out of the headlock,</v>

1986
00:49:01.361 --> 00:49:02.290
<v Speaker 1>put him in a rear choke,</v>

1987
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:03.400
<v Speaker 1>went backwards off the door.</v>

1988
00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:04.510
<v Speaker 1>He went limp.</v>

1989
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:05.350
<v Speaker 1>I dropped him.</v>

1990
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.080
<v Speaker 1>And then as I turned to get out into the street,</v>

1991
00:49:08.081 --> 00:49:09.520
<v Speaker 1>cause there was cops everywhere at that point.</v>

1992
00:49:09.521 --> 00:49:10.241
<v Speaker 1>There's dogs,</v>

1993
00:49:10.241 --> 00:49:10.530
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1994
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:11.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a snow storm.</v>

1995
00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:12.611
<v Speaker 1>Last second,</v>

1996
00:49:12.611 --> 00:49:16.360
<v Speaker 1>I see this coming at the side of my head and I duck and it bounces off my head</v>

1997
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:17.890
<v Speaker 1>and this dude goes,</v>

1998
00:49:17.891 --> 00:49:18.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1999
00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:21.450
<v Speaker 1>like I was going to go down and I turned and I looked at him and rifle came with</v>

2000
00:49:21.451 --> 00:49:22.720
<v Speaker 1>a right hand and knocked him out.</v>

2001
00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.720
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing you know there's just dogs diving into the crowd.</v>

2002
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:27.160
<v Speaker 1>It was a good one.</v>

2003
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:27.970
<v Speaker 1>That was a fun one.</v>

2004
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Dogs,</v>

2005
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:29.523
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

2006
00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.420
<v Speaker 1>No dogs work.</v>

2007
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:32.343
<v Speaker 1>They work,</v>

2008
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:33.580
<v Speaker 1>they work real well.</v>

2009
00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:36.280
<v Speaker 1>That's not good because they don't know who the fuck they're biting.</v>

2010
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:37.091
<v Speaker 1>They might bite you.</v>

2011
00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:38.410
<v Speaker 1>They might bite the bad guys.</v>

2012
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:39.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2013
00:49:39.221 --> 00:49:41.680
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck dogs don't know who the bouncer is?</v>

2014
00:49:41.681 --> 00:49:43.080
<v Speaker 1>You know they clear crowd out real quick though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And massive mass stuff there.</v>

2047
00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:19.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2048
00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I had brindle mastiff and I always loved to have males and I had a stalker for</v>

2049
00:50:23.741 --> 00:50:25.510
<v Speaker 1>three years who was a psychopath.</v>

2050
00:50:25.511 --> 00:50:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2051
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:28.370
<v Speaker 1>So that was when I got first mass duff king.</v>

2052
00:50:28.371 --> 00:50:30.710
<v Speaker 1>He was 210 pounds,</v>

2053
00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:32.870
<v Speaker 1>but he was a brindle scary look like a Bengal tiger.</v>

2054
00:50:32.871 --> 00:50:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2055
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:37.160
<v Speaker 1>And he that those dogs are so powerful,</v>

2056
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:37.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2057
00:50:37.791 --> 00:50:41.480
<v Speaker 1>at that size when they're truly in shape where you can't stop them.</v>

2058
00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.960
<v Speaker 1>And there were people that were using mass stuffs for police work and they</v>

2059
00:50:44.961 --> 00:50:48.380
<v Speaker 1>stopped using them because a 210 pound mass mastiff on a human being,</v>

2060
00:50:48.381 --> 00:50:49.730
<v Speaker 1>they can kill them really fast.</v>

2061
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.930
<v Speaker 1>This is not a,</v>

2062
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:51.950
<v Speaker 1>this is not a bite dog.</v>

2063
00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:54.440
<v Speaker 1>This is a dog that can just have a screw,</v>

2064
00:50:54.441 --> 00:50:56.250
<v Speaker 1>go loose and rip somebody,</v>

2065
00:50:56.251 --> 00:50:57.140
<v Speaker 1>throw it out in a heartbeat.</v>

2066
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:58.150
<v Speaker 1>It just too big and powerful.</v>

2067
00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:01.520
<v Speaker 1>That hurts them if something hurts them and they think,</v>

2068
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:01.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2069
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:02.563
<v Speaker 1>this is a fight,</v>

2070
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.140
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2071
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to rip your fucking head clean off your body.</v>

2072
00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:07.270
<v Speaker 1>And that mass,</v>

2073
00:51:07.271 --> 00:51:10.790
<v Speaker 1>they've tested me a couple times for Alpha position in the house.</v>

2074
00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:11.683
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

2075
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:12.523
<v Speaker 1>it was one time up,</v>

2076
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:17.420
<v Speaker 1>a plastic bag in the wind was rolling through the woods and on my property and</v>

2077
00:51:17.421 --> 00:51:19.490
<v Speaker 1>he ran and he grabbed it and I told him,</v>

2078
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:19.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2079
00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:20.840
<v Speaker 1>King come here front.</v>

2080
00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:23.600
<v Speaker 1>And he came up to me and I put my hand on the plastic bag and he goes,</v>

2081
00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:25.811
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2082
00:51:25.811 --> 00:51:26.181
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2083
00:51:26.181 --> 00:51:26.881
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>

2084
00:51:26.881 --> 00:51:27.530
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2085
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:28.460
<v Speaker 1>this is test time.</v>

2086
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:31.130
<v Speaker 1>So I ripped the bag and it came out of his mouth.</v>

2087
00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2088
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.560
<v Speaker 1>And he really got pissed off at me.</v>

2089
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:34.603
<v Speaker 1>I was testing him.</v>

2090
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:36.380
<v Speaker 1>So at that point I'm like,</v>

2091
00:51:36.381 --> 00:51:36.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2092
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I can't back down to it now because this is it.</v>

2093
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:43.520
<v Speaker 1>So I put my fist against his teeth that he was showing and it was going to do it</v>

2094
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:47.970
<v Speaker 1>till it sees this and he's like this with his teeth going there,</v>

2095
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it,</v>

2096
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Joe it.</v>

2097
00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:53.360
<v Speaker 1>And finally he turned and backed off and then I pet him and he was wagging his</v>

2098
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:53.931
<v Speaker 1>tail and I was like,</v>

2099
00:51:53.931 --> 00:51:54.764
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:56.750

00:51:57.880 --> 00:51:58.190

00:53:08.751 --> 00:53:08.971
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2159
00:53:08.971 --> 00:53:09.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2160
00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:09.890
<v Speaker 3>to get angry.</v>

2161
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:10.910
<v Speaker 3>They'd talk to them raw.</v>

2162
00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:14.390
<v Speaker 3>They would hawk out when they turn green now they were just big.</v>

2163
00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:15.393
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2164
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:15.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2165
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:16.850
<v Speaker 3>It seems like they should.</v>

2166
00:53:16.851 --> 00:53:17.684
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2167
00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they did.</v>

2168
00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:18.961
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2169
00:53:18.961 --> 00:53:19.711
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they did.</v>

2170
00:53:19.711 --> 00:53:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I think they just look at the findings.</v>

2171
00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.041
<v Speaker 1>Jamie found it.</v>

2172
00:53:23.041 --> 00:53:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2173
00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh dear God.</v>

2174
00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2175
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.813
<v Speaker 3>That's scary.</v>

2176
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:31.170
<v Speaker 3>That was like real bad CGI to boy when you watched that movie.</v>

2177
00:53:31.171 --> 00:53:32.910
<v Speaker 3>It's funny cause that wasn't that long ago,</v>

2178
00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:33.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2179
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:35.790
<v Speaker 3>I think that was only like 15 years ago.</v>

2180
00:53:35.791 --> 00:53:36.624
<v Speaker 3>What year was that?</v>

2181
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:38.003
<v Speaker 3>If you had to guess?</v>

2182
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:39.923
<v Speaker 3>15 years ago.</v>

2183
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.660
<v Speaker 3>So his dad,</v>

2184
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:43.530
<v Speaker 3>my dog,</v>

2185
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:44.363
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Cash,</v>

2186
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:49.110
<v Speaker 3>his dad curly was in fear factor and that was literally what he was built.</v>

2187
00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Like wow.</v>

2188
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:50.970
<v Speaker 3>But smaller than that,</v>

2189
00:53:50.971 --> 00:53:51.610
<v Speaker 3>obviously that's,</v>

2190
00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:52.650
<v Speaker 3>that's when he helps out.</v>

2191
00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.230
<v Speaker 3>So they took him and sort of exaggerated him.</v>

2192
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

2193
00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:58.350
<v Speaker 3>Basically looked like that you could find him just,</v>

2194
00:53:58.351 --> 00:54:00.960
<v Speaker 3>just Google regency mastiff curly.</v>

2195
00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:01.661
<v Speaker 3>He was a,</v>

2196
00:54:01.661 --> 00:54:05.010
<v Speaker 3>a famous stud cause it's just fucking ridiculous dog.</v>

2197
00:54:05.011 --> 00:54:08.040
<v Speaker 3>But the thing about the dog was when we had him on the set,</v>

2198
00:54:08.041 --> 00:54:09.540
<v Speaker 3>he would just fucking chill.</v>

2199
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.830
<v Speaker 3>He was a black dog.</v>

2200
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:11.940
<v Speaker 3>So none of those are him.</v>

2201
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.560
<v Speaker 3>It's probably a lot of dogs named curly.</v>

2202
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.010
<v Speaker 3>It's all right.</v>

2203
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:14.843
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

2204
00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:15.923
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2205
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:17.820
<v Speaker 3>the dog was just so friendly,</v>

2206
00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:18.420
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2207
00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.980
<v Speaker 3>and then when it was time to go,</v>

2208
00:54:19.981 --> 00:54:21.420
<v Speaker 3>when they put the bite suit on people,</v>

2209
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:25.560
<v Speaker 3>it was hilarious because we were using [inaudible] for awhile and you get like a</v>

2210
00:54:25.561 --> 00:54:27.760
<v Speaker 3>big football player type dude is about two 40.</v>

2211
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.570
<v Speaker 3>They can't bring them down cause they could hold onto it and they could,</v>

2212
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:31.740
<v Speaker 3>that dog is only 60,</v>

2213
00:54:31.741 --> 00:54:32.330
<v Speaker 3>70 pounds.</v>

2214
00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:33.720
<v Speaker 3>He come around curly,</v>

2215
00:54:33.721 --> 00:54:36.300
<v Speaker 3>grab a hold of you and it would be like they got hit by a truck.</v>

2216
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.580
<v Speaker 3>It would just go fly in and crash to the ground.</v>

2217
00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:41.130
<v Speaker 3>And one of the ones that we did was actually my friend,</v>

2218
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.170
<v Speaker 3>ed's girlfriend was on the show.</v>

2219
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:43.801
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2220
00:54:43.801 --> 00:54:43.921
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2221
00:54:43.921 --> 00:54:44.850
<v Speaker 3>I knew her before.</v>

2222
00:54:44.851 --> 00:54:45.181
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

2223
00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:45.871
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus.</v>

2224
00:54:45.871 --> 00:54:49.650
<v Speaker 3>I felt bad because she weighed like a buck 10 and they're putting her in this</v>

2225
00:54:49.651 --> 00:54:54.651
<v Speaker 3>fucking bite suit and then curly hits her like literally like she got hit by a</v>

2226
00:54:54.691 --> 00:54:55.524
<v Speaker 3>tree.</v>

2227
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:56.700
<v Speaker 3>Like someone took a tree,</v>

2228
00:54:56.701 --> 00:54:59.400
<v Speaker 3>one of those swinging trees and just boom.</v>

2229
00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:00.270
<v Speaker 3>Did she get her skills?</v>

2230
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:01.170
<v Speaker 3>She was okay.</v>

2231
00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:01.441
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

2232
00:55:01.441 --> 00:55:02.274
<v Speaker 3>she's a tough kid.</v>

2233
00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.030
<v Speaker 3>How many,</v>

2234
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:05.610
<v Speaker 3>how many episodes of fear factor did you do where you were like,</v>

2235
00:55:05.611 --> 00:55:09.240
<v Speaker 3>this is horrible to do to one when they had a ride bulls one,</v>

2236
00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:10.480
<v Speaker 3>when they had a drink come there.</v>

2237
00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.073
<v Speaker 3>I'll</v>

2238
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:17.880
<v Speaker 3>see the dog gets these people just boom,</v>

2239
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:18.780
<v Speaker 3>get down bitch.</v>

2240
00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:20.580
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not going nowhere.</v>

2241
00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:20.851
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2242
00:55:20.851 --> 00:55:21.684
<v Speaker 3>nice.</v>

2243
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:25.520
<v Speaker 3>But the problem was with these dogs is they bite so hard that if they get ahold</v>

2244
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:26.940
<v Speaker 3>of a bone through the suit,</v>

2245
00:55:26.941 --> 00:55:27.870
<v Speaker 3>they can break a bone.</v>

2246
00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:28.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2247
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.453

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:29.881
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:32.040
<v Speaker 3>You had people drink Kombucha on free.</v>

2251
00:55:32.041 --> 00:55:32.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't drink.</v>

2252
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.280
<v Speaker 3>I never saw.</v>

2253
00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:33.840
<v Speaker 3>What was it like?</v>

2254
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:34.673
<v Speaker 3>It never aired.</v>

2255
00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.000
<v Speaker 3>It was a donkey come.</v>

2260
00:55:44.221 --> 00:55:45.750
<v Speaker 3>they had a day at a drink,</v>

2261

00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

2267
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:53.340
<v Speaker 3>there's two episodes where I said,</v>

2268
00:55:53.341 --> 00:55:54.174
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>

2269
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:57.270
<v Speaker 3>One of them was riding bulls and the other one was the donkey Kong people got</v>

2270
00:55:57.271 --> 00:55:57.720
<v Speaker 3>hurt.</v>

00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Did you have a conversation with that,</v>

2303
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Paul?</v>

2304
00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Because he understands that's a ball.</v>

2305
00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:35.920
<v Speaker 1>That's how bull are so big.</v>

2306
00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:36.701
<v Speaker 1>Because we were,</v>

2307
00:56:36.701 --> 00:56:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I was standing next to the person while they were,</v>

2308
00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:39.430
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

2309
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2310
00:56:39.671 --> 00:56:41.260
<v Speaker 1>there's the pen and they,</v>

2311
00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:41.890
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2312
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:44.080
<v Speaker 1>they sit on top of the ball and you're right there.</v>

2313
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:46.630
<v Speaker 1>So I'm standing right next to him on the platform and I'm like,</v>

2314
00:56:46.631 --> 00:56:47.464
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

2315
00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you're going to hang on.</v>

2316
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.310
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

2317
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:51.070
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2318
00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:55.750
<v Speaker 1>my first year in college wrestling at Sioux Empire up by the South Dakota</v>

2319
00:56:55.751 --> 00:56:56.584
<v Speaker 1>border,</v>

2320
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:57.700
<v Speaker 1>middle of nowhere,</v>

2321
00:56:57.820 --> 00:56:59.730
<v Speaker 1>we got recruited by a guy that was an all American.</v>

2322
00:56:59.731 --> 00:57:00.940
<v Speaker 1>And I was state Johnny Johnson,</v>

2323
00:57:00.941 --> 00:57:01.751
<v Speaker 1>who was the coach up there,</v>

2324
00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:02.584
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2325
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:04.240
<v Speaker 1>And myself and three other buddies,</v>

2326
00:57:04.241 --> 00:57:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Mike Wolf from American pickers.</v>

2327
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Rustled with me that year up there.</v>

2328
00:57:08.081 --> 00:57:08.914
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2329
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:10.250
<v Speaker 1>And he's actually a tough guy.</v>

2330
00:57:10.251 --> 00:57:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Lot of people don't realize it.</v>

2331
00:57:11.171 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Mike Wolf's actually a really tough dude.</v>

2332
00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2333
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:15.760
<v Speaker 1>but to keep ourselves busy,</v>

2334
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:17.560
<v Speaker 1>we would go,</v>

2335
00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:18.880
<v Speaker 1>all the wrestlers would go,</v>

2336
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.810
<v Speaker 1>and there was,</v>

2337
00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:21.490
<v Speaker 1>there was fields everywhere next to the college.</v>

2338
00:57:21.491 --> 00:57:23.380
<v Speaker 1>It was small junior college in the middle of nowhere.</v>

2339
00:57:23.381 --> 00:57:24.214
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2340
00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:28.240
<v Speaker 1>So there was this huge Angus bull in the field right by the college.</v>

2341
00:57:28.241 --> 00:57:31.750
<v Speaker 1>So we would go over there and the first guy that could grab the bull's head</v>

2342
00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:33.011
<v Speaker 1>would win the money.</v>

2343
00:57:33.011 --> 00:57:34.000
<v Speaker 1>We put money in the pot,</v>

2344
00:57:34.001 --> 00:57:34.271
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2345
00:57:34.271 --> 00:57:35.350
<v Speaker 1>So we're running around the,</v>

2346
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:36.340
<v Speaker 1>the owner,</v>

2347
00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.090
<v Speaker 1>the farm owner,</v>

2348
00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:39.700
<v Speaker 1>the farmer pulls up one time in his pickup truck and he goes,</v>

2349
00:57:39.701 --> 00:57:40.990
<v Speaker 1>what do you idiots doing?</v>

2350
00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:42.080
<v Speaker 1>We got,</v>

2351
00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.310
<v Speaker 1>we put money in a pot and the first guy that can grab the bolts head wins and</v>

2352
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:45.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2353
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:46.030
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2354
00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:46.990
<v Speaker 1>that's the game we're playing,</v>

2355
00:57:46.991 --> 00:57:47.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2356
00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:48.310
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

2357
00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:49.810
<v Speaker 1>you got to stay off my property,</v>

2358
00:57:49.811 --> 00:57:50.081
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2359
00:57:50.081 --> 00:57:51.310
<v Speaker 1>knock this shit off.</v>

2360
00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:54.880
<v Speaker 1>And then we got to where the sheep would always escape another farm and come</v>

2361
00:57:54.881 --> 00:57:57.250
<v Speaker 1>onto the lawn of the college.</v>

2362
00:57:57.700 --> 00:57:59.830
<v Speaker 1>And Mike Wolfe and I got in trouble one day.</v>

2363
00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:01.301
<v Speaker 1>We'd take these,</v>

2364
00:58:01.301 --> 00:58:03.100
<v Speaker 1>these rams and we'd smack them in the forehead,</v>

2365
00:58:03.101 --> 00:58:06.160
<v Speaker 1>palm in the forehead to get them to jump up on their back legs and try and smash</v>

2366
00:58:06.161 --> 00:58:06.850
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

2367
00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.160
<v Speaker 1>And then we'd sidestep them and headlock him and throw him and stuff.</v>

2368
00:58:09.161 --> 00:58:09.994
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

2369
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:12.190
<v Speaker 1>that's what we were doing for fun back then.</v>

2370
00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:12.990
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2371
00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:13.823
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2372
00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:14.441
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

2373
00:58:14.441 --> 00:58:15.274
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2374
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:16.623
<v Speaker 1>Mike Wolfe,</v>

2375
00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:20.500
<v Speaker 1>one of the ladies that worked in the cafeteria sauce doing it and she goes,</v>

2376
00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.060
<v Speaker 1>you boys leave those animals alone.</v>

2377
00:58:22.061 --> 00:58:22.301
<v Speaker 1>Quit.</v>

2378
00:58:22.301 --> 00:58:23.021
<v Speaker 1>Stop doing that.</v>

2379
00:58:23.021 --> 00:58:23.261
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2380
00:58:23.261 --> 00:58:24.094
<v Speaker 1>That's cruel.</v>

2381
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:25.060
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't hurting him.</v>

2382
00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:25.841
<v Speaker 1>We were just having the phone.</v>

2383
00:58:25.841 --> 00:58:26.920
<v Speaker 1>We were born college kids,</v>

2384
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:27.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2385
00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.473
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2386
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:29.890
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2387
00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:30.131
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2388
00:58:30.131 --> 00:58:31.660
<v Speaker 1>but you should see what squirrel does to them.</v>

2389
00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.990
<v Speaker 1>And Squirrel was one of the basketball players from east Saint Louis who played</v>

2390
00:58:34.991 --> 00:58:36.070
<v Speaker 1>on the basketball team up there.</v>

2391
00:58:36.071 --> 00:58:37.720
<v Speaker 1>And we had guys from Miami,</v>

2392
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:38.680
<v Speaker 1>south side of Chicago,</v>

2393
00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:39.550
<v Speaker 1>East St Louis,</v>

2394
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:40.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2395
00:58:40.031 --> 00:58:43.000
<v Speaker 1>just tough ghetto kids who got thrown into this,</v>

2396
00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:43.871
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2397
00:58:43.871 --> 00:58:44.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2398
00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 1>farm atmosphere.</v>

2399
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:47.500
<v Speaker 1>It was totally foreign for them,</v>

2400
00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.450
<v Speaker 1>but we made the joke,</v>

2401
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:53.200
<v Speaker 1>and this was a very religious cafeteria lady and I said,</v>

2402
00:58:53.201 --> 00:58:54.670
<v Speaker 1>you should see what squirrels doing to them.</v>

2403
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.480
<v Speaker 1>And the next day we came in for lunch.</v>

2404
00:58:56.481 --> 00:58:59.530
<v Speaker 1>She was scolding squirrel about beastiality and he's looking at me.</v>

2405
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:04.600
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2406
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:05.441
<v Speaker 1>that was good times.</v>

2407
00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:06.274
<v Speaker 1>Good Times Fan.</v>

2408
00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:06.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2409
00:59:06.551 --> 00:59:08.650
<v Speaker 1>That's a ridiculous thing to do with your time.</v>

2410
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:10.060
<v Speaker 1>We had nothing else to do.</v>

2411
00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

2412
00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.190
<v Speaker 1>You should find something else until he needed somebody.</v>

2413
00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Some guidance.</v>

2414
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

2415
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.900
<v Speaker 1>that's the uh,</v>

2416
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.310
<v Speaker 1>hey warden Iowa,</v>

2417
00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:20.320
<v Speaker 1>which was right on the South Dakota border,</v>

2418
00:59:20.321 --> 00:59:21.110
<v Speaker 1>tiny little town.</v>

2419
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:21.950
<v Speaker 1>The college was there.</v>

2420
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:27.640
<v Speaker 1>And One night I went drinking and I got in a fight with a bike gang and they</v>

2421
00:59:27.861 --> 00:59:29.330
<v Speaker 1>were beating me with pool cues.</v>

2422
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:30.540
<v Speaker 1>But if that's not,</v>

2423
00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:31.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2424
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.030
<v Speaker 1>whatever it happened.</v>

2425
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:34.340
<v Speaker 1>But I had a guy,</v>

2426
00:59:34.341 --> 00:59:37.130
<v Speaker 1>a biker was at the urinal and I walked into the bathroom and he goes,</v>

2427
00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:39.380
<v Speaker 1>quit dragging your feet.</v>

2428
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:40.783
<v Speaker 1>Eight man.</v>

2429
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:41.631
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

2430
00:59:41.631 --> 00:59:41.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2431
00:59:41.841 --> 00:59:43.820
<v Speaker 1>people that mind their business don't get the shit kicked out of him.</v>

2432
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.013
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2433
00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:45.471
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

2434
00:59:45.471 --> 00:59:45.890
<v Speaker 1>bring it.</v>

2435
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:47.210
<v Speaker 1>So I crushed the toilet with him,</v>

2436
00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:47.781
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2437
00:59:47.781 --> 00:59:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I beat his head on the toilet and powder the toilet.</v>

2438
00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:51.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like roadhouse.</v>

2439
00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:51.741
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2440
00:59:51.741 --> 00:59:56.270
<v Speaker 1>but then the other bikers heard the commotion and I came out of there and they</v>

2441
00:59:56.271 --> 00:59:57.660
<v Speaker 1>all started beating me with pool cues.</v>

2442
00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.930
<v Speaker 1>And I was fighting my way out of there and I made my way out.</v>

2443
01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I got back to the school and my scalp all split open and everywhere.</v>

2444
01:00:03.591 --> 01:00:07.520
<v Speaker 1>And my arms are beat to hell from blocking pool cues and I lost my gold</v>

2445
01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:07.911
<v Speaker 1>necklace,</v>

2446
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>so I had to go down there the next day to go back and get my frigging necklace.</v>

2447
01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:14.960
<v Speaker 1>It was a big rope chain necklace that my girlfriend at the time of bought for me</v>

2448
01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.750
<v Speaker 1>and I walked in and I go,</v>

2449
01:00:17.751 --> 01:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I lost my chain here last night.</v>

2450
01:00:19.011 --> 01:00:19.611
<v Speaker 1>And the owner goes,</v>

2451
01:00:19.611 --> 01:00:19.791
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2452
01:00:19.791 --> 01:00:20.031
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2453
01:00:20.031 --> 01:00:21.680
<v Speaker 1>you put five people in the hospital last night.</v>

2454
01:00:21.681 --> 01:00:21.891
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2455
01:00:21.891 --> 01:00:23.510
<v Speaker 1>don't ever come back here again man.</v>

2456
01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

2457
01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.670
<v Speaker 1>don't come back.</v>

2458
01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.580
<v Speaker 1>This is so that's just the way it was dealt.</v>

2459
01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:29.300
<v Speaker 1>The Iowa,</v>

2460
01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:30.133
<v Speaker 1>that was Iowa.</v>

2461
01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.093
<v Speaker 1>That's what we did for fun.</v>

2462
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Has such a reputation for a tough guys when it comes to wrestling.</v>

2463
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

2464
01:00:37.161 --> 01:00:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I will wrestlers,</v>

2465
01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:38.680
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2466
01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2467
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.650
<v Speaker 1>you know like there's like Thai kickboxers,</v>

2468
01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Iowa wrestling.</v>

2469
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:45.380
<v Speaker 1>It was always this thing.</v>

2470
01:00:45.381 --> 01:00:48.980
<v Speaker 1>It was almost synonymous with Iowa when Gable was coaching the eyewear wrestling</v>

2471
01:00:48.981 --> 01:00:52.640
<v Speaker 1>team beat up the football team and the basketball team on numerous occasions</v>

2472
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>he'd have to go get those guys out of jail.</v>

2473
01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:56.180
<v Speaker 1>They just beat up the whole team.</v>

2474
01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2475
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:57.590
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine,</v>

2476
01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:57.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2477
01:00:57.831 --> 01:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>if someone actually thought they were a tough guy and they talked to those tough</v>

2478
01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:01.180
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

2479
01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:01.521
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2480
01:01:01.521 --> 01:01:01.701
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2481
01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>we've got to show you something because you're going through this life with his</v>

2482
01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:09.020
<v Speaker 1>delusional perspective and a blue and the Ed bannock and guys like that.</v>

2483
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Just King Mueller back in those days,</v>

2484
01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:12.531
<v Speaker 1>some very,</v>

2485
01:01:12.531 --> 01:01:13.610
<v Speaker 1>very scary wrestlers.</v>

2486
01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people truly understand the difference between them and regular</v>

2487
01:01:16.671 --> 01:01:17.504
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>

2488
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.110
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

2489
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they've ever expire.</v>

2490
01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to like just lock up with them to experience it.</v>

2491
01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>The explosiveness,</v>

2492
01:01:24.531 --> 01:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>the tendon strength,</v>

2493
01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>just the power of the sheer of just violence.</v>

2494
01:01:28.461 --> 01:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>If those guys can bring in a short burst of energy,</v>

2495
01:01:31.251 --> 01:01:35.990
<v Speaker 1>it's until you get used to it and you see it all the time and in fighting a guy</v>

2496
01:01:35.991 --> 01:01:39.560
<v Speaker 1>who's never trained with guys at that level of athleticism,</v>

2497
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:44.390
<v Speaker 1>right suddenly find themselves getting mauled by a superior human being going,</v>

2498
01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

2499
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I never had any idea a human like this even existed.</v>

2500
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:48.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2501
01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:50.300
<v Speaker 1>you see it when you'll well fights.</v>

2502
01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2503
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:51.051
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

2504
01:01:51.051 --> 01:01:51.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2505
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Romeo gets ahold of guys when DOL,</v>

2506
01:01:53.121 --> 01:01:58.121
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a guy who metaled in every single international competition</v>

2507
01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>he ever and beat Cael Sanderson when was was 18 years old,</v>

2508
01:02:02.271 --> 01:02:02.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2509
01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2510
01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:03.920
<v Speaker 1>That's a scary dude.</v>

2511
01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Beat him twice.</v>

2512
01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2513
01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:08.230
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking monster and when he gets a hold of guys,</v>

2514
01:02:08.231 --> 01:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>he could see the way he rag dolls people.</v>

2515
01:02:09.921 --> 01:02:10.161
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2516
01:02:10.161 --> 01:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2517
01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:12.740
<v Speaker 1>But that's what it is.</v>

2518
01:02:12.741 --> 01:02:15.440
<v Speaker 1>It's just this next level athleticism,</v>

2519
01:02:15.441 --> 01:02:16.640
<v Speaker 1>next level strength,</v>

2520
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:17.900
<v Speaker 1>next level technique.</v>

2521
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>And then also just being</v>

2522
01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:24.700
<v Speaker 2>forged in the competition of that Cuban Westling program.</v>

2523
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the podcast I had with him last week?</v>

2524
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.810
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2525
01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:32.010
<v Speaker 2>I had him on last week with Joey Diaz and Joey Diaz translated for him and they</v>

2526
01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:33.050
<v Speaker 2>went back and forth like,</v>

2527
01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

2528
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:34.700
<v Speaker 2>you always try to speak,</v>

2529
01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:36.060
<v Speaker 2>speak as much as he could in English.</v>

2530
01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:38.690
<v Speaker 2>And then Joey would sort of translate the stuff that he couldn't write.</v>

2531
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.680
<v Speaker 2>He just detailed his,</v>

2532
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:44.130
<v Speaker 2>his time in the system and the Cuban wrestling system and how intense it was.</v>

2533
01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

2534
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:45.091
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2535
01:02:45.091 --> 01:02:46.380
<v Speaker 2>think about their communist country.</v>

2536
01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:47.660
<v Speaker 2>That's your ticket.</v>

2537
01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2538
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:49.890
<v Speaker 2>To at least leading a halfway decent life.</v>

2539
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.790
<v Speaker 2>We'll just to eat.</v>

2540
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:54.210
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about the difference between the way the elite guys would eat in</v>

2541
01:02:54.211 --> 01:02:55.650
<v Speaker 2>ways where they would sleep.</v>

2542
01:02:55.651 --> 01:02:56.790
<v Speaker 2>They would get three meals a day,</v>

2543
01:02:56.791 --> 01:02:57.830
<v Speaker 2>the other guys would get to,</v>

2544
01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:59.370
<v Speaker 2>and the food would be better.</v>

2545
01:02:59.371 --> 01:03:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Everything would be better.</v>

2546
01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.200
<v Speaker 2>That would motivate you to win.</v>

2547
01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:01.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2548
01:03:01.621 --> 01:03:02.640
<v Speaker 2>And they're all together.</v>

2549
01:03:02.641 --> 01:03:03.211
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

2550
01:03:03.211 --> 01:03:03.991
<v Speaker 2>They're all trained together.</v>

2551
01:03:03.991 --> 01:03:06.360
<v Speaker 2>So the guys who want your spot or right next to you,</v>

2552
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:07.411
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows like,</v>

2553
01:03:07.411 --> 01:03:07.561
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2554
01:03:07.561 --> 01:03:08.730
<v Speaker 2>you got a hurt wrist.</v>

2555
01:03:08.731 --> 01:03:09.241
<v Speaker 2>They know.</v>

2556
01:03:09.241 --> 01:03:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows everything.</v>

2557
01:03:10.141 --> 01:03:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2558
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.101
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2559
01:03:11.101 --> 01:03:13.200
<v Speaker 2>that competition just makes you a machine.</v>

2560
01:03:13.201 --> 01:03:14.790
<v Speaker 2>And the guy that's eaten two meals a day,</v>

2561
01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:15.020
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>

2562
01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:15.840
<v Speaker 2>three meals a day,</v>

2563
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.201
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

2564
01:03:16.201 --> 01:03:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

2565
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Does.</v>

2566
01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:17.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2567
01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:19.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2568
01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:19.830
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2569
01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:21.060
<v Speaker 2>and then on top of that,</v>

2570
01:03:21.061 --> 01:03:23.130
<v Speaker 2>you have these fucking incredible genetics.</v>

2571
01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:23.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2572
01:03:23.641 --> 01:03:26.460
<v Speaker 2>the Cubans have a unfucking believable genetics.</v>

2573
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:27.621
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>

2574
01:03:27.621 --> 01:03:28.680
<v Speaker 2>an amazing pot.</v>

2575
01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:29.523
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

2576
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:33.960
<v Speaker 2>that's really one of the more fascinating things about competition is to see all</v>

2577
01:03:33.961 --> 01:03:34.950
<v Speaker 2>these variables.</v>

2578
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.490
<v Speaker 2>And it's to see like when you think you've reached this high level,</v>

2579
01:03:38.491 --> 01:03:39.181
<v Speaker 2>I'll look at this,</v>

2580
01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:40.560
<v Speaker 2>there's another level past that.</v>

2581
01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.040
<v Speaker 2>There's another level passed that and let you get,</v>

2582
01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:48.080
<v Speaker 2>you see guys who in no way shape or form should be a champion or upper echelon</v>

2583
01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.100
<v Speaker 2>athletically or genetically,</v>

2584
01:03:50.101 --> 01:03:51.300
<v Speaker 2>but they figured out how to do it.</v>

2585
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:51.661
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2586
01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:51.990
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2587

01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2595
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:58.290

01:03:58.890 --> 01:03:59.041

01:04:00.301 --> 01:04:00.601
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>

2600
01:04:00.601 --> 01:04:01.800
<v Speaker 2>Alvin on the streets.</v>

2601
01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2602
01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:02.401
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2603
01:04:02.401 --> 01:04:02.700
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2604
01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.670
<v Speaker 2>And you got in an argument with him for whatever reason you think I'm going to</v>

2605
01:04:05.671 --> 01:04:06.990
<v Speaker 2>kick this guy's ass.</v>

2606
01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.990
<v Speaker 2>He's wearing a sweater with a tie underneath it.</v>

2607
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:10.680
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a car sale,</v>

2608
01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:11.070
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

2609
01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:12.420
<v Speaker 2>The guy's tougher than shit.</v>

2610
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:13.890
<v Speaker 2>He's just would've never guessed.</v>

2611
01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:14.671
<v Speaker 2>You'd never guess.</v>

2612
01:04:14.671 --> 01:04:14.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2613
01:04:14.821 --> 01:04:15.690
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of those guys,</v>

2614
01:04:15.691 --> 01:04:15.841
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2615
01:04:15.841 --> 01:04:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Evan Dunham,</v>

2616
01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:17.131
<v Speaker 2>you'd never know.</v>

2617
01:04:17.131 --> 01:04:17.640

2618

<v Speaker 2>done them.</v>

2619
01:04:17.911 --> 01:04:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Looks like a nice gentleman.</v>

2620
01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:21.000
<v Speaker 2>I'll beat the fuck out of you.</v>

2621
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.020
<v Speaker 2>And you just go home and go,</v>

2622
01:04:22.021 --> 01:04:22.854
<v Speaker 2>I'm never fighting the,</v>

2623
01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.210
<v Speaker 2>this is just the stupid.</v>

2624
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:24.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2625
01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Well you'd learn that in Jujitsu too.</v>

2626
01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:27.450
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I first started training,</v>

2627
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I would get choked out by guys to just looked like nothing.</v>

2628
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:31.810
<v Speaker 2>Compared to the weight 150 pounds.</v>

2629
01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:32.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2630
01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:32.880
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2631
01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.880
<v Speaker 2>especially now like I think now a Jujitsu is really been a adopted by a lot of,</v>

2632
01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:41.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2633
01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:41.970
<v Speaker 2>like Eddie calls.</v>

2634
01:04:41.971 --> 01:04:43.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm like nervous acids,</v>

2635
01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:43.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2636
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Because they really are like these guys who are just really smart or into the</v>

2637
01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:50.780
<v Speaker 2>technique and into the fact that it's,</v>

2638
01:04:50.781 --> 01:04:53.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a Jujitsu by a computer programmer.</v>

2639
01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2640
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:54.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2641
01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:57.060
<v Speaker 2>That level of thinking through things and that's cool.</v>

2642
01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.970
<v Speaker 2>I've rolled with a lot of guys like that and go this,</v>

2643
01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:00.343
<v Speaker 2>this is stupid.</v>

2644
01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:01.440
<v Speaker 2>This guy is,</v>

2645
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.970
<v Speaker 2>especially now with the leg lock game,</v>

2646
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:03.930
<v Speaker 2>with a leg lock game,</v>

2647
01:05:03.931 --> 01:05:06.390
<v Speaker 2>it seems like strength is less of a factor.</v>

2648
01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.151
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2649
01:05:07.151 --> 01:05:07.440
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't,</v>

2650
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.340
<v Speaker 2>you guys are isolating legs and you're constantly defending against that and</v>

2651
01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:13.980
<v Speaker 2>whatever strength that you do have in your back and your core and your upper</v>

2652
01:05:13.981 --> 01:05:14.460
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

2653
01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.990
<v Speaker 2>you're not really getting a chance to utilize it.</v>

2654
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:19.050
<v Speaker 2>You're just trying to defend if you don't understand the positions.</v>

2655
01:05:19.051 --> 01:05:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2656
01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:20.170
<v Speaker 2>And they get,</v>

2657
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:20.891
<v Speaker 2>they get deep,</v>

2658
01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:22.810
<v Speaker 2>they get a couple of steps in on you and you're like,</v>

2659
01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:23.470
<v Speaker 2>oof.</v>

2660
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:23.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2661
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.570
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take a strong guy.</v>

2662
01:05:25.571 --> 01:05:27.010
<v Speaker 2>And I always loved leg locks.</v>

2663
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:27.940
<v Speaker 2>I love leg locks.</v>

2664
01:05:27.941 --> 01:05:29.350
<v Speaker 2>And the guy like Dave Manet,</v>

2665
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hume,</v>

2666
01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:33.040
<v Speaker 2>those guys were all sick leg lockers,</v>

2667
01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:33.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2668
01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2669
01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:34.580
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2670
01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.560

<v Speaker 2>I'm Matt Hume Wrestle in that.</v>

2675
01:05:42.101 --> 01:05:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that one time were Peretti put together a thing with Dan Gable</v>

2676
01:05:46.301 --> 01:05:47.860
<v Speaker 2>was the commentator with Peretti.</v>

2677
01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:49.180
<v Speaker 2>He went against an Olympic wrestler.</v>

2678
01:05:49.181 --> 01:05:51.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure my Johnson Kenny Monday.</v>

2679
01:05:51.011 --> 01:05:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Kenny Monday,</v>

2680
01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:52.360
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Kenny mom.</v>

2681
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Cause either Kevin because Kevin Jackson lost the Sherman Jackson loss to frank</v>

2682
01:05:56.861 --> 01:05:57.490

2683
01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:58.000

<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson House to Frank.</v>

2688
01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.720
<v Speaker 2>Frank got him in a foot lock.</v>

2689
01:06:04.721 --> 01:06:05.021
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2690
01:06:05.021 --> 01:06:05.400
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2691
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:05.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2692
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:06.453
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2693
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:07.391
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2694
01:06:07.391 --> 01:06:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Kenny Monday.</v>

2695
01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:12.070
<v Speaker 2>That's when Kurt Angle was calling the action and I was sitting next to Kurt</v>

2696
01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Angle and Kurt was asking me questions.</v>

2697
01:06:13.661 --> 01:06:14.020
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>

2698
01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:14.700
<v Speaker 2>what's he doing?</v>

2699
01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2700
01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:16.900
<v Speaker 2>So what do you what to say on the air and stuff,</v>

2701
01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:17.500
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2702
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:18.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2703
01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:19.510
<v Speaker 2>That was an interesting thing.</v>

2704
01:06:19.511 --> 01:06:20.770
<v Speaker 2>That submission tournament.</v>

2705
01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:22.210
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was great.</v>

2706
01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:23.530
<v Speaker 2>I thought if they were to ever do it again,</v>

2707
01:06:23.531 --> 01:06:23.980
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2708
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.330
<v Speaker 2>but they kind of do that now anyway.</v>

2709
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:26.470
<v Speaker 2>They do do that now,</v>

2710
01:06:26.471 --> 01:06:30.040
<v Speaker 2>but for whatever reason it doesn't get that much attention.</v>

2711
01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:30.874
<v Speaker 2>Although Eddie,</v>

2712
01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Eddie bravos figured out a way to give it a little bit more attention.</v>

2713
01:06:33.401 --> 01:06:35.290
<v Speaker 2>If he's seen combat Jujitsu a little bit,</v>

2714
01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.950
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it basically like pankration style slaps like open hand strikes.</v>

2715
01:06:38.951 --> 01:06:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2716
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:40.420
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2717
01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:40.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2718
01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:41.410
<v Speaker 2>it opens up,</v>

2719
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:41.651
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2720
01:06:41.651 --> 01:06:44.290
<v Speaker 2>it's also like what we were talking about before with,</v>

2721
01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:44.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2722
01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.850
<v Speaker 2>there's some stuff that you can get away with an MMA because there's no head</v>

2723
01:06:47.851 --> 01:06:48.400
<v Speaker 2>buds.</v>

2724
01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.400
<v Speaker 2>There's some stuff that you can get away with another styles like in,</v>

2725
01:06:51.401 --> 01:06:54.220
<v Speaker 2>in kickbox even cause there is no clinching and there's no elbows,</v>

2726
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:54.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2727
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.650
<v Speaker 2>There's all these different little things.</v>

2728
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:57.543
<v Speaker 2>Well with,</v>

2729
01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:58.900
<v Speaker 2>with Jujitsu,</v>

2730
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:01.380
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of positions where a guy could just smack you in the face.</v>

2731
01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:02.550
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to let go the lock.</v>

2732
01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:06.550
<v Speaker 2>And now guys are doing that with combat Jujitsu and it's a good intermediary</v>

2733
01:07:06.551 --> 01:07:07.900
<v Speaker 2>step between,</v>

2734
01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:10.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a good way to find out if you're meant for MMA to that too.</v>

2735
01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2736
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:11.491
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2737
01:07:11.491 --> 01:07:11.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2738
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:12.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2739
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:13.023
<v Speaker 2>I find that he,</v>

2740
01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:14.770
<v Speaker 2>I've always found Eddie really interesting.</v>

2741
01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.293
<v Speaker 2>He's a trip.</v>

2742
01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:18.490
<v Speaker 2>He's a trip and you can tell he's a thinker,</v>

2743
01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.241
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2744
01:07:19.241 --> 01:07:19.480
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

2745
01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.640
<v Speaker 2>he's a very analytical guy,</v>

2746
01:07:21.641 --> 01:07:24.490
<v Speaker 2>very analytical grappler with great flexibility.</v>

2747
01:07:24.491 --> 01:07:26.040
<v Speaker 2>I just always would watch them go,</v>

2748
01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:27.640
<v Speaker 2>this guy's fucking slick man.</v>

2749
01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.930
<v Speaker 2>And he knows a lot of shit,</v>

2750
01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.250
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to Jujitsu.</v>

2751
01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:30.980
<v Speaker 2>And I'm talking,</v>

2752
01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:31.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2753
01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:31.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2754
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna see him tomorrow morning.</v>

2755
01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

2756
01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:34.670
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

2757
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2758
01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:35.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2759
01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.213
<v Speaker 2>Sam triply?</v>

2760
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:36.731
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2761
01:07:36.731 --> 01:07:37.770
<v Speaker 2>No Sam very well.</v>

2762
01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.850
<v Speaker 2>So I'm doing that show.</v>

2763
01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2764
01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:41.111
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2765
01:07:41.111 --> 01:07:41.831
<v Speaker 2>and he's going to be there.</v>

2766
01:07:41.831 --> 01:07:45.280
<v Speaker 2>I want him to explain flat earth to me because he's not going to be able to,</v>

2767
01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:47.801
<v Speaker 2>I want to know.</v>

2768
01:07:47.801 --> 01:07:48.970
<v Speaker 2>But this is what it is.</v>

2769
01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:52.030
<v Speaker 2>Eddie thinks that everybody's lying,</v>

2770
01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:54.520
<v Speaker 2>that everybody and NASA and the government,</v>

2771
01:07:54.521 --> 01:07:55.360
<v Speaker 2>and because of that,</v>

2772
01:07:55.361 --> 01:07:59.020
<v Speaker 2>I believe he has a blind spot and that he lived there telling you the world's</v>

2773
01:07:59.021 --> 01:07:59.381
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

2774
01:07:59.381 --> 01:07:59.681
<v Speaker 2>He's saying,</v>

2775
01:07:59.681 --> 01:07:59.801
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2776
01:07:59.801 --> 01:08:00.520
<v Speaker 2>it can't be round.</v>

2777
01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2778
01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:02.290
<v Speaker 2>And it's not a good way to think.</v>

2779
01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:02.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2780
01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:05.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's the same reason why he's so good at Jujitsu.</v>

2781
01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:09.400
<v Speaker 2>It's cause he sees an idea and he just pursues it and chases after it turns to</v>

2782
01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:11.230
<v Speaker 2>the right digits is like,</v>

2783
01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.213
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

2784
01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:12.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2785
01:08:12.941 --> 01:08:13.751
<v Speaker 2>it's all quantified.</v>

2786
01:08:13.751 --> 01:08:14.360
<v Speaker 2>It's all right there.</v>

2787
01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Two bodies.</v>

2788
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:15.801
<v Speaker 2>It's all very simple.</v>

2789
01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 2>There's no</v>

2790
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.630
<v Speaker 1>mystery.</v>

2791
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.841
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2792
01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:17.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2793
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.960
<v Speaker 1>it's just a figure.</v>

2794
01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:19.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just figuring out a puzzle.</v>

2795
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2796
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>But I can see how people get that way because I was a guy who,</v>

2797
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2798
01:08:24.741 --> 01:08:25.730
<v Speaker 1>not to go off on a tangent,</v>

2799
01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:27.140
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's fun to think about.</v>

2800
01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:31.700
<v Speaker 1>In 1971 when I was a young boy standing in line in Albia,</v>

2801
01:08:31.701 --> 01:08:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Iowa with my grandma and my mom when the farm collapse was happening and when</v>

2802
01:08:34.701 --> 01:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Nixon took us off the gold standard,</v>

2803
01:08:36.231 --> 01:08:37.064
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2804
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Shit fell apart for the farmers right away.</v>

2805
01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:43.370
<v Speaker 1>And my grandma was one of the first people in line to get her money out of the</v>

2806
01:08:43.371 --> 01:08:44.690
<v Speaker 1>farmer's national bank in Albia,</v>

2807
01:08:44.691 --> 01:08:45.524
<v Speaker 1>Iowa.</v>

2808
01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:46.221
<v Speaker 1>And she got it out.</v>

2809
01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:47.750
<v Speaker 1>And I remember still to this day,</v>

2810
01:08:47.751 --> 01:08:49.550
<v Speaker 1>standing there and asking my mom and my grandma,</v>

2811
01:08:49.551 --> 01:08:50.600
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is going on?</v>

2812
01:08:50.601 --> 01:08:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Why is this happening?</v>

2813
01:08:51.681 --> 01:08:52.431
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

2814
01:08:52.431 --> 01:08:53.330
<v Speaker 1>You could see the panic.</v>

2815
01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:58.670
<v Speaker 1>The farmers went for blocks right from all around that part of Iowa and it just,</v>

2816
01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.420
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what started the wheels turning in my head about being a</v>

2817
01:09:02.421 --> 01:09:03.320
<v Speaker 1>contrarian thinker.</v>

2818
01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:09.160
<v Speaker 1>There's real conspiracies and there's real things where people misunderstand the</v>

2819
01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.310
<v Speaker 1>actual facts.</v>

2820
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2821
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Flatters not one of them.</v>

2822
01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2823
01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:13.840
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

2824
01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:14.620
<v Speaker 1>it's just not,</v>

2825
01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:15.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2826
01:09:15.610 --> 01:09:16.780
<v Speaker 1>there's so many stuff.</v>

2827
01:09:16.781 --> 01:09:17.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2828
01:09:17.001 --> 01:09:20.570
<v Speaker 1>looked snipers used the curvature of the earth to calculate ballistics.</v>

2829
01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2830
01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:21.591
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2831
01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:21.981
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2832
01:09:21.981 --> 01:09:22.814
<v Speaker 1>it's a real thing,</v>

2833
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:23.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2834
01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:23.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2835
01:09:23.421 --> 01:09:24.710
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of shit that's not real,</v>

2836
01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:25.850
<v Speaker 1>but I want Eddie to tell me,</v>

2837
01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I want him to explain it is going to be frustrating.</v>

2838
01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:30.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I believe in anymore.</v>

2839
01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.550
<v Speaker 1>He might've let it go by now.</v>

2840
01:09:31.551 --> 01:09:32.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hope and he did.</v>

2841
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:32.841
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2842
01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:34.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't talk to him about it anymore.</v>

2843
01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:34.911
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2844
01:09:34.911 --> 01:09:38.240
<v Speaker 1>we had a few conversations about it on the podcast and initially he thought it</v>

2845
01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:38.690
<v Speaker 1>was stupid.</v>

2846
01:09:38.690 --> 01:09:40.250
<v Speaker 1>He thought the flat earth concept was too,</v>

2847
01:09:40.251 --> 01:09:40.640
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2848
01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.490
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden he started being open minded to it.</v>

2849
01:09:42.491 --> 01:09:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2850
01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:44.090
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you saying?</v>

2851
01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck are you saying?</v>

2852
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:46.483
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

2853
01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.550
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2854
01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:49.520
<v Speaker 1>and he kept going to the fake the moon landing.</v>

2855
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:50.990
<v Speaker 1>They send me the same people.</v>

2856
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2857
01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:51.780
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

2858
01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:52.640
<v Speaker 1>if they did,</v>

2859
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:54.440
<v Speaker 1>that was a long fucking time ago.</v>

2860
01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:55.670
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about people right now.</v>

2861
01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:58.700
<v Speaker 1>There's satellites all over the world that they,</v>

2862
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:00.740
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that think satellites are fake.</v>

2863
01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2864
01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.200
<v Speaker 1>I think anything's dinosaurs aren't real.</v>

2865
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2866
01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2867
01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2868
01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.250
<v Speaker 1>You know what's interesting and I never,</v>

2869
01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:11.020
<v Speaker 1>and the first time I fought in the UFC I went into things.</v>

2870
01:10:11.021 --> 01:10:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaurs or business.</v>

2871
01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2872
01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:13.453
<v Speaker 1>It hurts.</v>

2873
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:14.423
<v Speaker 1>Hurts my head.</v>

2874
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I went into the,</v>

2875
01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:19.130
<v Speaker 1>the production trailer and my first UFC,</v>

2876
01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to see what was going on in there.</v>

2877
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.991
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2878
01:10:20.991 --> 01:10:21.380
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

2879
01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:24.320
<v Speaker 1>that always intrigued me how TV was put together.</v>

2880
01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:25.154
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2881
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:28.190
<v Speaker 1>And that was lucky enough to bring my daughter to one of our broadcast with</v>

2882
01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:30.710
<v Speaker 1>access TV and Lonnie,</v>

2883
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:31.370
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

2884
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:33.410
<v Speaker 1>he's the expert to find the satellites.</v>

2885
01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:35.000
<v Speaker 1>He's got an APP on his phone.</v>

2886
01:10:35.001 --> 01:10:36.260
<v Speaker 1>If you ever seen guys do that.</v>

2887
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:36.650
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2888
01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:39.860
<v Speaker 1>He has an app on his phone where he can punch it in and do this across the sky.</v>

2889
01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.060
<v Speaker 1>It's spot all the,</v>

2890
01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:42.051
<v Speaker 1>the satellites.</v>

2891
01:10:42.051 --> 01:10:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2892
01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2893
01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:43.310
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

2894
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:45.180
<v Speaker 1>So he knows how to dial into them.</v>

2895
01:10:45.181 --> 01:10:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Call Up.</v>

2896
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:46.281
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2897
01:10:46.281 --> 01:10:46.650
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2898
01:10:46.650 --> 01:10:48.350
<v Speaker 1>the coordinates to turn the,</v>

2899
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.661
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2900
01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:51.830
<v Speaker 1>the dish towards and lock onto a percentage of the satellite,</v>

2901
01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:52.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2902
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:54.050
<v Speaker 1>receptor to get it being back down,</v>

2903
01:10:54.051 --> 01:10:54.884
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of stuff.</v>

2904
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:57.260
<v Speaker 1>So he was teaching my daughter how all that stuff was done.</v>

2905
01:10:57.261 --> 01:10:58.270
<v Speaker 1>And it was first time I'd ever seen,</v>

2906
01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:58.551
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

2907
01:10:58.551 --> 01:10:59.384
<v Speaker 1>this was pretty,</v>

2908
01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:00.410
<v Speaker 1>pretty amazing stuff.</v>

2909
01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:01.401
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2910
01:11:01.401 --> 01:11:04.550
<v Speaker 1>you can see the curvature of the earth and how the satellites are set across the</v>

2911
01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:05.001
<v Speaker 1>horizon.</v>

2912
01:11:05.001 --> 01:11:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2913
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2914
01:11:05.541 --> 01:11:06.710
<v Speaker 1>you could track satellites.</v>

2915
01:11:06.711 --> 01:11:07.131
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>

2916
01:11:07.131 --> 01:11:08.630
<v Speaker 1>these guys don't even believe in satellites.</v>

2917
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Here's what the problem is.</v>

2918
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:12.680
<v Speaker 1>If someone has no,</v>

2919
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>and they put</v>

2920
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:16.170
<v Speaker 3>together a video and that video,</v>

2921
01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.780
<v Speaker 3>they're articulate and they sound calm,</v>

2922
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:23.900
<v Speaker 3>they use big words and they show you images that they're claiming show that the</v>

2923
01:11:24.241 --> 01:11:25.021
<v Speaker 3>earth is flat,</v>

2924
01:11:25.021 --> 01:11:27.090
<v Speaker 3>that there's an ice wall outside of Antarctica,</v>

2925
01:11:27.091 --> 01:11:28.560
<v Speaker 3>and that the government won't let you go there.</v>

2926
01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:30.060
<v Speaker 3>They start saying all these things,</v>

2927
01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:31.560
<v Speaker 3>if there's no one there,</v>

2928
01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.810
<v Speaker 3>no like Neil degrasse Tyson type guy.</v>

2929
01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:34.211
<v Speaker 3>There he's go,</v>

2930
01:11:34.211 --> 01:11:34.381
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2931
01:11:34.381 --> 01:11:34.501
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2932
01:11:34.501 --> 01:11:35.040
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2933
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:35.790
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2934
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:36.541
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>

2935
01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:37.374
<v Speaker 3>And here's why.</v>

2936
01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.290
<v Speaker 3>And here's how we know and here's what we found out and here's a test you can do</v>

2937
01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:40.810
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

2938
01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Here's how you can figure it out,</v>

2939
01:11:41.851 --> 01:11:42.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2940
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:42.863
<v Speaker 3>And here's Wiki,</v>

2941
01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.570
<v Speaker 3>what you could find online and here.</v>

2942
01:11:44.571 --> 01:11:47.610
<v Speaker 3>And like for the longest time they were trying to say that there was no full</v>

2943
01:11:47.611 --> 01:11:48.780
<v Speaker 3>pictures of the earth.</v>

2944
01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:49.681
<v Speaker 3>That the,</v>

2945
01:11:49.681 --> 01:11:50.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2946
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:50.290
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2947
01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:50.730
<v Speaker 3>the earth,</v>

2948
01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:51.660
<v Speaker 3>like every photo you see,</v>

2949
01:11:51.661 --> 01:11:52.740
<v Speaker 3>if the earth is a composite,</v>

2950
01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:53.250
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2951
01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:55.770
<v Speaker 3>does it fucking Japanese satellite called the hemo Ari aid.</v>

2952
01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.940
<v Speaker 3>It takes full,</v>

2953
01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.800
<v Speaker 3>full images of the earth.</v>

2954
01:11:58.801 --> 01:11:59.820
<v Speaker 3>High resolution,</v>

2955
01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:01.620
<v Speaker 3>every 10 minutes you can go Google it,</v>

2956
01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:02.700
<v Speaker 3>you can watch them.</v>

2957
01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:03.250
<v Speaker 3>There's the,</v>

2958
01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:04.560
<v Speaker 3>NASA has one too.</v>

2959
01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:09.630
<v Speaker 3>There's giant photos of the fucking earth from 22,000 miles out or whatever the</v>

2960
01:12:09.631 --> 01:12:10.464
<v Speaker 3>hell it is.</v>

2961
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.753
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

2962
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:12.660
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking real.</v>

2963
01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:15.480
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of shit to think about.</v>

2964
01:12:15.481 --> 01:12:16.440
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>

2965
01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.550
<v Speaker 3>That's not one of them,</v>

2966
01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.200
<v Speaker 3>like that's been solved.</v>

2967
01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:20.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2968
01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm into the geopolitical and domestic policy shit.</v>

2969
01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2970
01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:24.573
<v Speaker 1>That's where I,</v>

2971
01:12:25.690 --> 01:12:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I was drawn more about what's really going on,</v>

2972
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:28.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2973
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:29.590
<v Speaker 1>behind the news,</v>

2974
01:12:29.591 --> 01:12:30.424
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of stuff.</v>

2975
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:31.690
<v Speaker 1>This is bullshit.</v>

2976
01:12:31.691 --> 01:12:34.990
<v Speaker 1>And I was lucky to train a lot of law enforcement and then military high level</v>

2977
01:12:34.991 --> 01:12:37.900
<v Speaker 1>military and get connected to Intel guys who go,</v>

2978
01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:38.441
<v Speaker 1>pat,</v>

2979
01:12:38.441 --> 01:12:39.460
<v Speaker 1>we need to talk like,</v>

2980
01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:39.941
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2981
01:12:39.941 --> 01:12:40.930
<v Speaker 1>you're completely off.</v>

2982
01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain things to you.</v>

2983
01:12:42.671 --> 01:12:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2984
01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:43.721
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2985
01:12:43.721 --> 01:12:44.201
<v Speaker 1>as far as like,</v>

2986
01:12:44.201 --> 01:12:45.340
<v Speaker 1>what were you completely off about?</v>

2987
01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2988
01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you what I was right about when I called up my buddy and I go,</v>

2989
01:12:49.931 --> 01:12:50.764
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2990
01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:52.000
<v Speaker 1>four years ago,</v>

2991
01:12:52.001 --> 01:12:52.631
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

2992
01:12:52.631 --> 01:12:53.670
<v Speaker 1>four and a half years ago,</v>

2993
01:12:53.671 --> 01:12:54.504
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2994
01:12:54.730 --> 01:12:55.541
<v Speaker 1>we're funding Isis,</v>

2995
01:12:55.541 --> 01:12:56.020
<v Speaker 1>aren't we?</v>

2996
01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:56.231
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2997
01:12:56.231 --> 01:12:56.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2998
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:57.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2999
01:12:57.130 --> 01:12:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3000
01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:57.720
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3001
01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.540
<v Speaker 1>those the go between guy.</v>

3002
01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.373
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

3003
01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:02.770
<v Speaker 1>I'll news for Isis friggin Al Shabaab.</v>

3004
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:04.270
<v Speaker 1>What are you fucking think?</v>

3005
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:07.720
<v Speaker 1>So why did they fund isis to take out Syria?</v>

3006
01:13:08.290 --> 01:13:09.011
<v Speaker 1>It was obvious,</v>

3007
01:13:09.011 --> 01:13:09.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3008
01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.720
<v Speaker 1>The mujahideen in Afghanistan,</v>

3009
01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.310
<v Speaker 1>the frigging take out the Russians,</v>

3010
01:13:12.311 --> 01:13:15.910
<v Speaker 1>but the way I looked at it was when that was going on funding,</v>

3011
01:13:15.911 --> 01:13:17.830
<v Speaker 1>the Mujahideen was to bankrupt Russia,</v>

3012
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:18.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3013
01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3014
01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.710
<v Speaker 1>We wanted them to go bankrupt and it worked.</v>

3015
01:13:20.711 --> 01:13:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Reagan was,</v>

3016
01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:23.350
<v Speaker 1>was a genius in that park.</v>

3017
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:26.770
<v Speaker 1>The diabolical part of course is Russian and American both fighting over the</v>

3018
01:13:26.771 --> 01:13:27.940
<v Speaker 1>resources of Afghanistan.</v>

3019
01:13:28.210 --> 01:13:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3020
01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:30.950
<v Speaker 1>But Isis was just theirs.</v>

3021
01:13:31.690 --> 01:13:32.501
<v Speaker 1>That's some weird shit.</v>

3022
01:13:32.501 --> 01:13:37.450
<v Speaker 1>When you have a 50,000 man army just appear out of nowhere with professional</v>

3023
01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:42.460
<v Speaker 1>cameramen and editors and producers and directors making the high level films</v>

3024
01:13:44.501 --> 01:13:45.251
<v Speaker 1>that they were putting out,</v>

3025
01:13:45.251 --> 01:13:48.490
<v Speaker 1>where it's every three seconds they're cut in different angles professionally</v>

3026
01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:50.770
<v Speaker 1>put together films of people being burned.</v>

3027
01:13:50.771 --> 01:13:51.604
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3028
01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:52.700
<v Speaker 1>this is this,</v>

3029
01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.560
<v Speaker 1>this is too weird.</v>

3030
01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:54.251
<v Speaker 1>This is too weird.</v>

3031
01:13:54.251 --> 01:13:55.750
<v Speaker 1>You know when people stop talking about,</v>

3032
01:13:55.930 --> 01:13:57.490
<v Speaker 1>do you remember when they blame</v>

3033
01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:00.150
<v Speaker 3>Ghazi on some bullshit video,</v>

3034
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:02.100
<v Speaker 3>some video that someone made,</v>

3035
01:14:02.101 --> 01:14:02.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3036
01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:05.130
<v Speaker 3>What was it like the tears of Muslims or something like that,</v>

3037
01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:06.000
<v Speaker 3>or I forget that.</v>

3038
01:14:06.001 --> 01:14:07.070
<v Speaker 3>Nobody even knew it existed.</v>

3039
01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.190
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knew it existed.</v>

3040
01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.810
<v Speaker 3>And everybody knew it was bullshit.</v>

3041
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.920
<v Speaker 3>And they were pushing that as a,</v>

3042
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:12.160
<v Speaker 3>like this is what</v>

3043
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.660
<v Speaker 1>was the motivation behind.</v>

3044
01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:14.711
<v Speaker 1>And everybody was like,</v>

3045
01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:16.750
<v Speaker 1>what have you had Perato on your show?</v>

3046
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.290
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3047
01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:18.123
<v Speaker 1>Who's this?</v>

3048
01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:19.810
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

3049
01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:20.321
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

3050
01:14:20.321 --> 01:14:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Former seal.</v>

3051
01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.050
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>

3052
01:14:22.050 --> 01:14:22.883
<v Speaker 1>Toronto.</v>

3053
01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:24.051
<v Speaker 1>Rol Name.</v>

3054
01:14:24.051 --> 01:14:24.930
<v Speaker 1>T a presumptive.</v>

3055
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.560
<v Speaker 1>His last name's Perato,</v>

3056
01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:28.150
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's a former seal.</v>

3057
01:14:28.151 --> 01:14:30.640
<v Speaker 1>There were several seals obviously that ran to try and help,</v>

3058
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3059
01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.460
<v Speaker 1>the ambassador and some of the other guys,</v>

3060
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Toronto lived through it.</v>

3061
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:36.430
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3062
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:36.680
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3063
01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.030
<v Speaker 1>when he talks about it,</v>

3064
01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.513
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3065
01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:42.670
<v Speaker 1>they're moving massive amounts of weapons through Libya,</v>

3066
01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:43.930
<v Speaker 1>into Syria,</v>

3067
01:14:43.931 --> 01:14:45.430
<v Speaker 1>into other places in the Middle East.</v>

3068
01:14:45.431 --> 01:14:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3069
01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:47.470
<v Speaker 1>There's just a fact that it's happening.</v>

3070
01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:50.470
<v Speaker 1>And that whole thing going down,</v>

3071
01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I think was a way for them to just cover it all up in a remove and erase any</v>

3072
01:14:54.941 --> 01:14:55.870
<v Speaker 1>people that knew about it.</v>

3073
01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:56.853
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3074
01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it spells out to me.</v>

3075
01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Pretty obvious because it's documented.</v>

3076
01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.280
<v Speaker 1>It's all documented that weapons were being moved.</v>

3077
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.120
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at,</v>

3078
01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:05.673
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3079
01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:09.070
<v Speaker 1>arsenal of weapons manufacturing in Bulgaria.</v>

3080
01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:12.460
<v Speaker 1>So Leon had goats and shy by who I had on my podcast,</v>

3082
01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:14.374
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3083
01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.170
<v Speaker 1>She was the Bulgarian reporter that got fired for it.</v>

3084
01:15:17.171 --> 01:15:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Now you had a podcast?</v>

3085

<v Speaker 1>It's a barn with a satellite and the satellite dish down next to the bar.</v>

01:15:55.571 --> 01:15:57.900
<v Speaker 1>the Isis fighters took here.</v>

3126
01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.290
<v Speaker 1>I took her to their weapons cache.</v>

3127
01:15:59.291 --> 01:15:59.411
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>going into Libya,</v>

3146
01:16:29.621 --> 01:16:31.480
<v Speaker 1>going into the Ukraine,</v>

3147
01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:32.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3148
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:35.560
<v Speaker 1>We're a bunch of shit was going down there and every one of those places who</v>

3149
01:16:35.561 --> 01:16:35.921
<v Speaker 1>showed up,</v>

3150
01:16:35.921 --> 01:16:36.290
<v Speaker 1>the broker,</v>

3151
01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:37.123
<v Speaker 1>the deals,</v>

3152
01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:38.553
<v Speaker 1>John Mccain,</v>

3153
01:16:39.010 --> 01:16:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3154
01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:40.593
<v Speaker 1>John Mccain,</v>

3155
01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:41.493
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3156
01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:42.700
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

3157
01:16:42.701 --> 01:16:43.600
<v Speaker 1>we can't prove it,</v>

3158
01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.830
<v Speaker 1>but there's people telling me that potentially there's an offshore company that</v>

3159
01:16:47.831 --> 01:16:51.190
<v Speaker 1>owns a big percentage of arsenal weapons manufacturing in Bulgaria,</v>

3160
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:51.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3161
01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.530
<v Speaker 1>So that's the kind of stuff I'm going in.</v>

3162
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm into who's who's causing it?</v>

3163
01:16:55.901 --> 01:16:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Why are they causing it?</v>

3164
01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.210
<v Speaker 1>The truth,</v>

3165
01:16:58.210 --> 01:16:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a truth seeker.</v>

3166
01:16:59.410 --> 01:16:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3167
01:16:59.580 --> 01:16:59.700
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3168
01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Would you seem like that kind of guy?</v>

3169
01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.060
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

3170
01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Do don't you think that that stuff is exposed at a level that's never been</v>

3171
01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.780
<v Speaker 1>possible before because of the Internet and that these people are probably used</v>

3172
01:17:11.781 --> 01:17:15.020
<v Speaker 1>to operating in a certain way that they'd been doing for decades and now they're</v>

3173
01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:15.890
<v Speaker 1>having to adjust.</v>

3174
01:17:16.570 --> 01:17:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3175
01:17:17.150 --> 01:17:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3176
01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:21.860
<v Speaker 1>and when people like you just doing these podcasts and talking about it,</v>

3177
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:25.790
<v Speaker 1>which opens the minds of other people and has them thinking about it,</v>

3178
01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:26.110
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3179
01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:26.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3180
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:28.440
<v Speaker 1>w w who are the people screaming the most of the,</v>

3181
01:17:28.441 --> 01:17:28.891
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>

3182
01:17:28.891 --> 01:17:29.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3183
01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:30.680
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even a Trump supporter.</v>

3184
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:31.551
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3185
01:17:31.551 --> 01:17:32.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm a rand Paul Guy.</v>

3186
01:17:32.451 --> 01:17:33.830
<v Speaker 1>You've got to fucking Rand Paul Shirt on,</v>

3187
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:34.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3188
01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:34.970
<v Speaker 1>The Ron Paul Guy,</v>

3189
01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:39.170
<v Speaker 1>you've got to teach him take down defense off of a one a lawnmower.</v>

3190
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.033
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3191
01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.680
<v Speaker 1>So you got blindsided in his defense,</v>

3192
01:17:42.681 --> 01:17:43.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3193
01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:43.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3194
01:17:43.341 --> 01:17:45.990
<v Speaker 1>But it was at about this neighborhood tack.</v>

3195
01:17:45.991 --> 01:17:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Those neighbors alluded tech.</v>

3196
01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:47.991
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3197
01:17:47.991 --> 01:17:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Good Times.</v>

3198
01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:49.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3199
01:17:49.071 --> 01:17:49.480
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3200
01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:49.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3201
01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a risky thing to do live right next to a guy on a,</v>

3202
01:17:52.371 --> 01:17:52.830
<v Speaker 1>tag them.</v>

3203
01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3204
01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Like you're fucking burning the bridge.</v>

3205
01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what kind of sentence that guy got though.</v>

3206
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:58.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3207
01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.720
<v Speaker 1>I haven't kept up on that,</v>

3208
01:17:59.721 --> 01:18:00.830
<v Speaker 1>but that was given sentence.</v>

3209
01:18:00.831 --> 01:18:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Yet during the presidential run,</v>

3210
01:18:02.421 --> 01:18:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I was given speeches for Rand Paul,</v>

3211
01:18:04.011 --> 01:18:05.570
<v Speaker 1>a couple of them to introduce him.</v>

3212
01:18:05.571 --> 01:18:08.930
<v Speaker 1>So I give a speech and then bringing them out and I got to know him a little bit</v>

3213
01:18:08.931 --> 01:18:09.764
<v Speaker 1>better in Iowa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

3233
01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:36.560
<v Speaker 1>going after an industry,</v>

3234
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:37.670
<v Speaker 1>crushing it,</v>

3235
01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:38.780
<v Speaker 1>ruining that stock.</v>

3236
01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.310
<v Speaker 1>And then my buddies by the company,</v>

3237
01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:44.510
<v Speaker 1>right when the stock collapses and then bringing it back up like the Gi bill for</v>

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.250
<v Speaker 1>a University of Memphis,</v>

01:18:50.601 --> 01:18:52.490
<v Speaker 1>The stock goes from 100 down to $3.</v>

3242
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Obama's buddy goes in and buys it,</v>

3243
01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:55.010
<v Speaker 1>then they go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3245
01:18:55.221 --> 01:18:56.960
<v Speaker 1>we're going to allow GI money to go back into it.</v>

3246
01:18:56.961 --> 01:18:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Now stock goes back up.</v>

3247
01:18:58.190 --> 01:18:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3248
01:18:58.790 --> 01:19:00.260

<v Speaker 1>it's some bad stuff.</v>

3251
01:19:01.971 --> 01:19:03.940
<v Speaker 1>And we just do our best to follow it.</v>

3252
01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:04.641
<v Speaker 1>Educate people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3290
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:51.480
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking about this recently,</v>

3291
01:19:51.481 --> 01:19:55.140
<v Speaker 1>about how half of what it is to be president and is to get yourself into a</v>

3292
01:19:55.141 --> 01:19:56.550
<v Speaker 1>position where after you're out,</v>

3293
01:19:56.551 --> 01:19:58.860
<v Speaker 1>you can make these crazy speeches for these bankers.</v>

3294
01:19:58.861 --> 01:19:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Like why is that?</v>

3295
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3296
01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:01.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

3297
01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:02.790
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like our man,</v>

3298
01:20:02.791 --> 01:20:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3299
01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:03.060
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3300
01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I told you there was a time when a good friend of mine who was an agent me at</v>

3301
01:20:07.621 --> 01:20:10.920
<v Speaker 1>the time got me involved because of all the years in MMA and martial arts,</v>

3302
01:20:10.921 --> 01:20:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I've met people from all over the world who had eventually moved in the piece up</v>

3303
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:18.060
<v Speaker 1>positions of power in government or cities or this or that.</v>

3304
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:19.171
<v Speaker 1>And so they said,</v>

3305
01:20:19.171 --> 01:20:23.490
<v Speaker 1>we want you to help us get our foot in the door to sell waste to energy</v>

3306
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.353
<v Speaker 1>projects.</v>

3307
01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.670
<v Speaker 1>So it was basically a,</v>

3308
01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.380
<v Speaker 1>a facility that bonds anything garbage.</v>

3309
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3310
01:20:28.681 --> 01:20:31.380
<v Speaker 1>you can burn tires and the thing at low oxygen levels,</v>

3311
01:20:31.381 --> 01:20:32.790
<v Speaker 1>so the emissions are very low,</v>

3312
01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:34.290
<v Speaker 1>but that generates electricity,</v>

3313
01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3314
01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:38.400
<v Speaker 1>And in Europe it was everybody from the city,</v>

3315
01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:39.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3316
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:42.360
<v Speaker 1>province that contrary and the European Union,</v>

3317
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:44.040
<v Speaker 1>everybody wanted a piece of the projects.</v>

3318
01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3319
01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:48.060
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way they do business in Europe and South America and other</v>

3320
01:20:48.061 --> 01:20:48.894
<v Speaker 1>places like that.</v>

3321
01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:52.320
<v Speaker 1>They have to have a different model for it here for the corruption.</v>

3322
01:20:52.321 --> 01:20:52.531
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3323
01:20:52.531 --> 01:20:55.410
<v Speaker 1>They just do things differently here and that's just the way it is.</v>

3324
01:20:55.411 --> 01:20:58.260
<v Speaker 1>They've made adjustments and either way they're going to find their way around</v>

3325
01:20:58.261 --> 01:20:58.740
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3326
01:20:58.740 --> 01:20:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3327
01:20:59.130 --> 01:21:02.580
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there's no corruption is ridiculous.</v>

3328
01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3329
01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:04.200
<v Speaker 1>No one thinks that.</v>

3330
01:21:04.230 --> 01:21:08.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's how much corruption is there and how many people are out there exposing</v>

3331
01:21:08.311 --> 01:21:10.560
<v Speaker 1>it and putting their neck out there to expose it.</v>

3332
01:21:10.561 --> 01:21:12.930
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of the problem because if you really know about it,</v>

3333
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:15.360
<v Speaker 1>that means you're probably entrenched in the system too.</v>

3334
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3335
01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:17.530
<v Speaker 1>And the cognitive dissonance of the,</v>

3336
01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:22.700
<v Speaker 1>the citizenry of knowing that Hillary Clinton and a few other people sold,</v>

3337
01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:24.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3338
01:21:24.391 --> 01:21:25.350
<v Speaker 1>the document just came out.</v>

3339
01:21:25.351 --> 01:21:27.690
<v Speaker 1>It was 15 million kilograms,</v>

3340
01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.830
<v Speaker 1>15 million kilograms of depleted uranium,</v>

3341
01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:32.713
<v Speaker 1>yellow cake.</v>

3342
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:33.833
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3343
01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Sold to the Russians.</v>

3344
01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:38.910
<v Speaker 1>At what point in any part of a discussion on any planet,</v>

3345
01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:44.240
<v Speaker 1>is it okay to sell your enemy 15 million kilograms of frigging uranium?</v>

3346
01:21:44.370 --> 01:21:46.340
<v Speaker 1>What was the justification behind it?</v>

3347
01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:48.630
<v Speaker 1>They agreed that this is a fact.</v>

3348
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:50.060
<v Speaker 1>This is what's a fact?</v>

3349
01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:50.721
<v Speaker 1>It's a fact.</v>

3350
01:21:50.721 --> 01:21:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Agreed.</v>

3351
01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:51.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's this,</v>

3352
01:21:51.631 --> 01:21:53.640
<v Speaker 1>is there any dispute that this is a fact?</v>

3353
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:54.240
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3354
01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.073
<v Speaker 1>There is no,</v>

3355
01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.230
<v Speaker 1>there's no they,</v>

3356
01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:59.010
<v Speaker 1>but they sit there and use the excuse.</v>

3357
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3358
01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:02.070
<v Speaker 1>there was eight other people that had to sign off on this.</v>

3359
01:22:02.190 --> 01:22:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3360
01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.473
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

3361
01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3362
01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:06.870
<v Speaker 1>but it was suddenly that company,</v>

3363
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:10.710
<v Speaker 1>suddenly that company invests $145 million in the,</v>

3364
01:22:10.711 --> 01:22:11.940
<v Speaker 1>in the Clinton Foundation.</v>

3365
01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:12.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3366
01:22:12.541 --> 01:22:13.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem.</v>

3367
01:22:13.531 --> 01:22:16.920
<v Speaker 1>That Clinton Foundation is fucking insane and all these people that were blind</v>

3368
01:22:16.921 --> 01:22:18.900
<v Speaker 1>supporters of Hillary that didn't look at that like,</v>

3369
01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:20.093
<v Speaker 1>how do you not,</v>

3370
01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.020
<v Speaker 1>how do you not find a giant problem with that?</v>

3371
01:22:22.050 --> 01:22:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3372
01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:23.233
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3373
01:22:23.290 --> 01:22:24.960
<v Speaker 1>and that book by Schweitzer talks about it,</v>

3374
01:22:25.650 --> 01:22:27.360
<v Speaker 1>he goes in detail about that stuff.</v>

3375
01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3376
01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:28.081
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

3377
01:22:28.081 --> 01:22:28.690
<v Speaker 1>How's this sobriety?</v>

3378
01:22:28.690 --> 01:22:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised that that's what that was just going to say after the Clinton cash</v>

3379
01:22:31.951 --> 01:22:32.581
<v Speaker 1>to the Russians.</v>

3380
01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Do Clinton cash was bad enough.</v>

3381
01:22:34.021 --> 01:22:34.890
<v Speaker 1>This one's even worse.</v>

3382
01:22:34.891 --> 01:22:35.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised he's not dead.</v>

3383
01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how many people are actually reading it.</v>

3384
01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:38.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3385
01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:39.421
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3386
01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:42.150
<v Speaker 1>I feel like they think that there's always going to be a certain amount of that</v>

3387
01:22:42.151 --> 01:22:44.670
<v Speaker 1>stuff out there and they just tolerate it and they just,</v>

3388
01:22:44.671 --> 01:22:46.950
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's not really fucking up their business,</v>

3389
01:22:46.951 --> 01:22:47.641
<v Speaker 1>cause it's not,</v>

3390
01:22:47.641 --> 01:22:49.230
<v Speaker 1>the politicians are still allowing it.</v>

3391
01:22:49.530 --> 01:22:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Law enforcement still allowing it and no one's really going after them.</v>

3392
01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:53.251
<v Speaker 1>It makes you wonder,</v>

3393
01:22:53.251 --> 01:22:56.880
<v Speaker 1>like if Hillary had actually gotten into the White House and she faced the same</v>

3394
01:22:56.881 --> 01:22:59.360
<v Speaker 1>scrutiny that Trump is facing right now over the Russian pros,</v>

3395
01:22:59.361 --> 01:23:01.830
<v Speaker 1>we know none of this would be uncovered had she won.</v>

3396
01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:02.101
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3397
01:23:02.101 --> 01:23:02.460
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3398
01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:02.621
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3399
01:23:02.621 --> 01:23:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

3400
01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3401
01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.530
<v Speaker 1>All of this stuff would have been swept the rug.</v>

3402
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3403
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Most likely.</v>

3404
01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And all this stuff with McCabe and uh,</v>

3405
01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:09.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3406
01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:14.940
<v Speaker 1>struck and page and call me and all these people of going out of their way to</v>

3407
01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:18.670
<v Speaker 1>try and derail Trump to get these FISA court,</v>

3408
01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:20.230
<v Speaker 1>frigging spa surveillance,</v>

3409
01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:25.231
<v Speaker 1>frigging warrants to spy on a president elect and then a sitting president.</v>

3410
01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:26.373
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>

3411
01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:28.240
<v Speaker 1>At what point is our people not,</v>

3412
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:30.370
<v Speaker 1>not charged with treason for that?</v>

3413
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.713
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3414
01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:33.093
<v Speaker 1>When</v>

3415
01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:35.470
<v Speaker 1>they were [inaudible],</v>

3416
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:38.440
<v Speaker 1>they were doing this spine before he ever won the presidency.</v>

3417
01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that if he was doing something wrong with the Russians,</v>

3418
01:23:41.261 --> 01:23:43.210
<v Speaker 1>they would have frigging made it mainstream news and,</v>

3419
01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.770
<v Speaker 1>and bustled him for it?</v>

3420
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:45.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3421
01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:49.270
<v Speaker 1>there's for sure some dummies and his staff that made some inappropriate</v>

3422
01:23:49.271 --> 01:23:50.320
<v Speaker 1>meetings and had some,</v>

3423
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:50.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3424
01:23:50.621 --> 01:23:52.180
<v Speaker 1>they definitely had some intentions.</v>

3425
01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:52.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3426
01:23:52.601 --> 01:23:53.920
<v Speaker 1>but they had something on him.</v>

3427
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:55.360
<v Speaker 1>The way I look at it as this,</v>

3428
01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:56.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3429
01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:57.580
<v Speaker 1>if you win the presidency,</v>

3430
01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to send whoever is underneath me.</v>

3431
01:24:00.431 --> 01:24:01.270
<v Speaker 1>If I'm the president,</v>

3432
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:04.750
<v Speaker 1>we have to have meetings with diplomats from other countries to make the</v>

3433
01:24:04.751 --> 01:24:05.560
<v Speaker 1>transition.</v>

3434
01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:05.861
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3435
01:24:05.861 --> 01:24:06.610
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the,</v>

3436
01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:07.480
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the deal,</v>

3437
01:24:07.481 --> 01:24:08.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3438
01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:08.950
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

3439
01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:09.730
<v Speaker 1>That goes on.</v>

3440
01:24:09.730 --> 01:24:10.960
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way it is.</v>

3441
01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.340
<v Speaker 1>But that's not what they're talking about.</v>

3442
01:24:12.341 --> 01:24:13.810
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about before the presidency.</v>

3443
01:24:13.811 --> 01:24:17.560
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about having meetings with Russians long before,</v>

3444
01:24:17.650 --> 01:24:17.891
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3445
01:24:17.891 --> 01:24:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Where they had planned this whole thing out.</v>

3446
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Like they got enough.</v>

3447
01:24:21.131 --> 01:24:21.910
<v Speaker 1>They're all dirty.</v>

3448
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:22.510
<v Speaker 1>They've got nothing.</v>

3449
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:23.060
<v Speaker 1>They got nothing.</v>

3450
01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:24.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean like if they had something new,</v>

3451
01:24:24.401 --> 01:24:25.360
<v Speaker 1>it would be out there.</v>

3452
01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:28.390
<v Speaker 1>It's that projection and diversion and everything else.</v>

3453
01:24:28.391 --> 01:24:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Because you know the Podesta's we're doing lobbying for the biggest friggin</v>

3454
01:24:31.901 --> 01:24:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Russian bank in the world.</v>

3455
01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:33.461
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3456
01:24:33.461 --> 01:24:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3457
01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:36.460
<v Speaker 1>In Washington DC that it never comes up.</v>

3458
01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:39.650
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like there's too many things to pay attention to that.</v>

3459
01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:41.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like they did everything.</v>

3460
01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:42.260
<v Speaker 1>They just how you,</v>

3461
01:24:42.261 --> 01:24:43.120
<v Speaker 1>how do you keep up?</v>

3462
01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:44.320
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

3463
01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.400
<v Speaker 1>how do you corral it?</v>

3464
01:24:45.401 --> 01:24:45.830
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>

3465
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:50.530
<v Speaker 1>all the corruption for the stock market to natural resources to everything.</v>

3466
01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3467
01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:51.141
<v Speaker 1>It's almost,</v>

3468
01:24:51.141 --> 01:24:52.300
<v Speaker 1>there's too many things to take,</v>

3469
01:24:52.301 --> 01:24:53.080
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to.</v>

3470
01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3471
01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:53.780
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3472
01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:54.581
<v Speaker 1>it's mind boggling.</v>

3473
01:24:54.581 --> 01:24:56.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like a giant room full of spaghetti.</v>

3474
01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3475
01:24:57.130 --> 01:24:57.970
<v Speaker 1>And you're in the middle of it.</v>

3476
01:24:58.140 --> 01:24:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Not just doing this.</v>

3477
01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:01.240
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking exciting way to put it.</v>

3478
01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:02.620
<v Speaker 1>That is what it's like.</v>

3479
01:25:02.650 --> 01:25:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3480
01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.620
<v Speaker 1>It does that to your brain when you tried to comprehend all of it.</v>

3481
01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:06.491
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

3482
01:25:06.491 --> 01:25:08.260
<v Speaker 1>when we do shows and we talk about this stuff,</v>

3483
01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:09.123
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3484
01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:10.030
<v Speaker 1>it's mind boggling.</v>

3485
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:11.020
<v Speaker 1>How many episodes have you done?</v>

3486

01:25:23.170 --> 01:25:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Conspiracy farm.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Check it out.</v>

3498
01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:27.221
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3499
01:25:27.221 --> 01:25:28.840
<v Speaker 1>so when you started this out,</v>

3500
01:25:28.841 --> 01:25:29.591
<v Speaker 1>what was the intention?</v>

3501
01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Just to something you're interested in?</v>

3502
01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:31.481
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3503
01:25:31.481 --> 01:25:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I did Jeffery's podcast,</v>

3504
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.930
<v Speaker 1>it's me speaking to you.</v>

3505
01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:37.630
<v Speaker 1>And at the very end of it it was three conspiracy questions.</v>

3506
01:25:37.690 --> 01:25:38.523
<v Speaker 1>True or false,</v>

3507
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:39.160
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3508
01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3509
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.911
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

3510
01:25:39.911 --> 01:25:41.200
<v Speaker 1>can I elaborate on them though?</v>

3511
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Cause it might be something that I've actually researched.</v>

3512
01:25:43.391 --> 01:25:43.601
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3513
01:25:43.601 --> 01:25:43.751
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3514
01:25:43.751 --> 01:25:44.021
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3515
01:25:44.021 --> 01:25:44.620
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

3516
01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:45.453
<v Speaker 1>at the end of it,</v>

3517
01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:46.571
<v Speaker 1>he asked me,</v>

3518
01:25:46.571 --> 01:25:47.590
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the questions were,</v>

3519
01:25:47.591 --> 01:25:49.540
<v Speaker 1>but after we were done,</v>

3520
01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:49.721
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3521
01:25:49.721 --> 01:25:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3522
01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:53.440
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to do this podcast and I want to call it the conspiracy farm</v>

3523
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:56.830
<v Speaker 1>and I want to talk about geopolitical domestic policy stuff.</v>

3524
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Unless anything goes,</v>

3525
01:25:58.271 --> 01:25:59.104

3529
01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:01.293
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

3530
01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.201
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3531
01:26:02.201 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 1>So we've had great guests,</v>

3532
01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:04.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3533
01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:05.720
<v Speaker 2>a couple of navy seals,</v>

3534
01:26:05.721 --> 01:26:08.180
<v Speaker 2>former Spetsnaz terrorist hunter.</v>

3535
01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3536
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:11.390
<v Speaker 2>well if you're going to do Sam Tripoli's podcast,</v>

3537
01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:12.440
<v Speaker 2>tin foil hat,</v>

3538
01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.160
<v Speaker 2>just understand that it's a different kind of conspiracy theory podcasts.</v>

3539
01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:18.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like his big foot psychic.</v>

3540
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Like those kind of questions.</v>

3541
01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:22.443
<v Speaker 2>You're going,</v>

3542
01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:23.493
<v Speaker 2>oh dear God.</v>

3543
01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:25.620
<v Speaker 2>And expect to get a contact high from the room.</v>

3544
01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:29.330
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to ask you about that George Saint Pierre stuff with Ufos.</v>

3545
01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:30.740
<v Speaker 2>I think its head trauma.</v>

3546
01:26:31.190 --> 01:26:31.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3547
01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3548
01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:32.810
<v Speaker 2>Where did he,</v>

3549
01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:34.610
<v Speaker 2>did he have sex with this hot green check?</v>

3550
01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:35.503
<v Speaker 2>Maybe did,</v>

3551
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:36.590
<v Speaker 2>but if I had a gas,</v>

3552
01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:40.190
<v Speaker 2>the way he was describing things is very similar to the way people describe</v>

3553
01:26:40.191 --> 01:26:42.650
<v Speaker 2>things when they've experienced successive head trauma.</v>

3554
01:26:42.710 --> 01:26:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3555
01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:43.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3556
01:26:43.311 --> 01:26:44.450
<v Speaker 2>Because he missed his time.</v>

3557
01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.550
<v Speaker 2>He's memory's not not good.</v>

3558
01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:50.270
<v Speaker 2>He'll get home and then he'll let have groceries that he bought and left in his</v>

3559
01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:51.590
<v Speaker 2>trunk and not even realize it.</v>

3560
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:53.930
<v Speaker 2>And they will go out to his trunk and the rotten and he's like,</v>

3561
01:26:53.931 --> 01:26:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember going to this door.</v>

3562
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:56.380
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3563
01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:57.150
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3564
01:26:57.150 --> 01:26:58.100
<v Speaker 2>so he's got,</v>

3565
01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.220
<v Speaker 2>I think he's got this idea that this,</v>

3566
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.350
<v Speaker 2>these glitches in his mind,</v>

3567
01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:07.880
<v Speaker 2>it's not a fucking coincidence that the guy got punched in the head.</v>

3568
01:27:07.881 --> 01:27:10.520
<v Speaker 2>I think they did a stat before the Bisping fight.</v>

3569
01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it was more than 800 times you got hit in the head and his UFC career.</v>

3570
01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Forget about all the gym training.</v>

3571
01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Forget about all the other stuff.</v>

3572
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.761
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3573
01:27:19.761 --> 01:27:21.350
<v Speaker 2>And forget about the fights outside the UFC.</v>

3574
01:27:21.351 --> 01:27:25.120
<v Speaker 2>Did he had before he got into the UFC when he was in Tko remember?</v>

3575
01:27:25.210 --> 01:27:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3576
01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:29.060
<v Speaker 2>So he's experienced a lot of head trauma.</v>

3577
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:33.020
<v Speaker 2>One of the symptoms of head trauma is memory loss issues and mean.</v>

3578
01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3579
01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:35.600
<v Speaker 2>and Hendricks hit him hard a lot.</v>

3580
01:27:35.630 --> 01:27:35.871
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3581
01:27:35.871 --> 01:27:36.440
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>

3582
01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:36.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3583
01:27:36.741 --> 01:27:38.120
<v Speaker 2>And he's only one guy that hit him hard.</v>

3584
01:27:38.121 --> 01:27:38.241
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3585
01:27:38.241 --> 01:27:39.230
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys hit him hard.</v>

3586
01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Matt Serra scrambled is fucking brain.</v>

3587
01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:41.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3588
01:27:41.931 --> 01:27:45.410
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys hit him hard and that's just outside of sparring.</v>

3589
01:27:45.411 --> 01:27:45.561
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3590
01:27:45.561 --> 01:27:49.010
<v Speaker 2>that's us outside of everything else that he's done sparring with Rory Mcdonald</v>

3591
01:27:49.011 --> 01:27:51.620
<v Speaker 2>and Wonderboy and all the other guys that he had a spar with.</v>

3592
01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3593
01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I think that's most likely what it is.</v>

3594
01:27:55.730 --> 01:27:57.200
<v Speaker 2>People who have been,</v>

3595
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:59.000
<v Speaker 2>who've experienced a lot of head trauma,</v>

3596
01:27:59.030 --> 01:28:01.490
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the real problems with it is um,</v>

3597
01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:02.933
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3598
01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:04.311
<v Speaker 2>what does,</v>

3599
01:28:04.311 --> 01:28:05.780
<v Speaker 2>what does the dude from the Chicago bears,</v>

3600
01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:06.650
<v Speaker 2>that famous guy,</v>

3601
01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:07.613
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

3602
01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.080
<v Speaker 2>quarterback from the bears fall?</v>

3603
01:28:10.090 --> 01:28:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Mcmann?</v>

3604
01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3605
01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:13.320
<v Speaker 2>Mcmahon was on the cover of sports illustrated talking about it,</v>

3606
01:28:13.530 --> 01:28:14.930
<v Speaker 2>but he'll be in the middle of his,</v>

3607
01:28:14.931 --> 01:28:15.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3608
01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:17.540
<v Speaker 2>his living room holding these keys.</v>

3609
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:19.760
<v Speaker 2>He had no idea how it's keys got in his hand,</v>

3610
01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:20.780
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know where he's going.</v>

3611
01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3612
01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Where am I going?</v>

3613
01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:22.131
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3614
01:28:22.131 --> 01:28:23.390
<v Speaker 2>why am I standing there holding my keys?</v>

3615
01:28:23.690 --> 01:28:24.590
<v Speaker 2>You just forget.</v>

3616
01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:25.141
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

3617
01:28:25.141 --> 01:28:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Scary.</v>

3618
01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:25.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3619
01:28:25.911 --> 01:28:27.260
<v Speaker 2>there's really skin actions.</v>

3620
01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:27.411
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3621
01:28:27.411 --> 01:28:29.000
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's been so impressive that you,</v>

3622
01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:30.380
<v Speaker 2>with your long fight career,</v>

3623
01:28:30.381 --> 01:28:32.080
<v Speaker 2>you kickbox you box dude.</v>

3624
01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:32.451
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3625
01:28:32.451 --> 01:28:33.770
<v Speaker 2>you had a lot of MMA fights.</v>

3626
01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I think I learned early on with the kickboxing and boxing and I looked at the</v>

3627
01:28:36.771 --> 01:28:38.750
<v Speaker 2>older guys and listen to them talk and went,</v>

3628
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be that guy.</v>

3629
01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:41.960
<v Speaker 2>So I started paying attention to defense.</v>

3630
01:28:41.961 --> 01:28:45.140
<v Speaker 2>I started watching films on great boxers with great defense,</v>

3631
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:46.101
<v Speaker 2>footwork,</v>

3632
01:28:46.101 --> 01:28:46.934
<v Speaker 2>head movement.</v>

3633
01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:47.361
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3634
01:28:47.361 --> 01:28:48.500
<v Speaker 2>all that sort of stuff and just,</v>

3635
01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:49.923
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

3636
01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:51.260
<v Speaker 2>and it was the key.</v>

3637
01:28:51.261 --> 01:28:53.090
<v Speaker 2>I never got hit with anything I didn't see.</v>

3638
01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.650
<v Speaker 2>I think you have sturdy jeans too.</v>

3639
01:28:54.651 --> 01:28:55.011
<v Speaker 2>You've got them.</v>

3640
01:28:55.011 --> 01:28:56.330
<v Speaker 2>Croatian gene helps.</v>

3641
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:57.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it helps.</v>

3642
01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:59.150
<v Speaker 2>So I'm the smallest Croatian on the planet.</v>

3643
01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:01.401
<v Speaker 2>When you run in,</v>

3644
01:29:01.401 --> 01:29:02.300
<v Speaker 2>the Croatians</v>

3645
01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:02.941
<v Speaker 1>are all huge,</v>

3646
01:29:02.941 --> 01:29:03.900
<v Speaker 1>like Cinco Cro,</v>

3647
01:29:03.901 --> 01:29:04.830
<v Speaker 1>cop type character,</v>

3648
01:29:04.831 --> 01:29:05.310
<v Speaker 1>steep,</v>

3649
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:05.671
<v Speaker 1>steep,</v>

3650
01:29:05.671 --> 01:29:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Emile say choose a bear of a human being.</v>

3651
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3652
01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.113
<v Speaker 1>Super.</v>

3653
01:29:09.150 --> 01:29:09.810
<v Speaker 1>But that's just so,</v>

3654
01:29:09.810 --> 01:29:12.660
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen the Olympic water polo team from Croatia?</v>

3655
01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:13.150
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3656
01:29:13.150 --> 01:29:15.390
<v Speaker 1>What can scariest dudes on the planet are going?</v>

3657
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:16.290
<v Speaker 1>All massive.</v>

3658
01:29:16.291 --> 01:29:16.621
<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>

3659
01:29:16.621 --> 01:29:18.270
<v Speaker 1>eight guys that just will drown you.</v>

3660
01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:19.410
<v Speaker 1>What happened to you?</v>

3661
01:29:19.411 --> 01:29:24.030
<v Speaker 1>There was a time where someone claimed that you had neck surgery and you didn't</v>

3662
01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:26.340
<v Speaker 1>like a doctor said something about it.</v>

3663
01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:29.610
<v Speaker 1>I was training for a fight with frank Trigg outside of the UFC.</v>

3664
01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:34.530
<v Speaker 1>It was the first round warm enough and I get hit with a left hook and my neck</v>

3665
01:29:34.531 --> 01:29:37.470
<v Speaker 1>crunched and my left arm dropped and wouldn't work anymore.</v>

3666
01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

3667
01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:39.983
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

3668
01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:41.850
<v Speaker 1>this just wouldn't lift at all.</v>

3669
01:29:41.851 --> 01:29:42.270
<v Speaker 1>It was done.</v>

3670
01:29:42.270 --> 01:29:43.103
<v Speaker 1>It was dead.</v>

3671
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Kitten move your hand?</v>

3672
01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:44.461
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3673
01:29:44.461 --> 01:29:45.210
<v Speaker 1>everything was dead.</v>

3674
01:29:45.210 --> 01:29:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3675
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:46.920
<v Speaker 1>So how long did that last?</v>

3676
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:47.161
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

3677
01:29:47.161 --> 01:29:47.761
<v Speaker 1>well here,</v>

3678
01:29:47.761 --> 01:29:48.594
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

3679
01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:50.130
<v Speaker 1>that was the end of the first round.</v>

3680
01:29:50.131 --> 01:29:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I got cracked with it,</v>

3681
01:29:51.031 --> 01:29:51.864
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3682
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:53.420
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

3683
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.610
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3684
01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:54.720
<v Speaker 1>let's pick it up the second round.</v>

3685
01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.390
<v Speaker 1>And I hit him with like four or five,</v>

3686
01:29:57.391 --> 01:29:58.260
<v Speaker 1>right hands in a row.</v>

3687
01:29:58.261 --> 01:29:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's all I could do.</v>

3688
01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And it crushed his nose and he had to have surgery because I was so pissed off</v>

3689
01:30:02.341 --> 01:30:02.850
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>

3690
01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3691
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:03.930
<v Speaker 1>he blasted me.</v>

3692
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3693
01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:04.550
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3694
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:06.330
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think it was necessarily malicious,</v>

3695
01:30:06.331 --> 01:30:08.100
<v Speaker 1>but we were still warming up and he cranked.</v>

3696
01:30:08.101 --> 01:30:08.411
<v Speaker 1>I left,</v>

3697
01:30:08.411 --> 01:30:08.880
<v Speaker 1>took on me,</v>

3698
01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:09.713
<v Speaker 1>it was bad.</v>

3699
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:12.980
<v Speaker 1>So over time everything started to atrophy on this side of the body and</v>

3700
01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.330
<v Speaker 1>everything started falling apart and it was very painful.</v>

3701
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:18.120
<v Speaker 1>And I went to a neurosurgeon and got an MRI.</v>

3702
01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Neurosurgeon goes,</v>

3703
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.581
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

3704
01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:21.310
<v Speaker 1>your spinal cord,</v>

3705
01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:21.610
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3706
01:30:21.610 --> 01:30:22.760
<v Speaker 1>your disc exploded.</v>

3707
01:30:22.761 --> 01:30:25.800
<v Speaker 1>It exploded into your spinal cord and almost separate it against the other side</v>

3708
01:30:25.801 --> 01:30:26.700
<v Speaker 1>of your spinal canal.</v>

3709
01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.380
<v Speaker 1>And he goes to make things worse.</v>

3710
01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:29.220
<v Speaker 1>You have so much to know.</v>

3711
01:30:29.221 --> 01:30:30.900
<v Speaker 1>So there's no fluid in there.</v>

3712
01:30:30.901 --> 01:30:32.310
<v Speaker 1>There's no spinal canal.</v>

3713
01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:36.420
<v Speaker 1>It's all scar tissue crushing your spinal cord everywhere surgically.</v>

3714
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:37.343
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3715
01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:38.570
<v Speaker 1>So you're in you.</v>

3716
01:30:38.730 --> 01:30:41.040
<v Speaker 1>This was bound to happen over all the years of abuse.</v>

3717
01:30:41.041 --> 01:30:42.060
<v Speaker 1>People wrenching on your neck,</v>

3718
01:30:42.061 --> 01:30:43.050
<v Speaker 1>punching you and everything else.</v>

3719
01:30:43.051 --> 01:30:44.730
<v Speaker 1>It just eventually gave way.</v>

3720
01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:46.540
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>

3721
01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:47.520
<v Speaker 1>you have to have surgery.</v>

3722
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:48.420
<v Speaker 1>You're Christopher Reeves.</v>

3723
01:30:48.421 --> 01:30:50.070
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like you fall off,</v>

3724
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:51.210
<v Speaker 1>you fall off a ladder,</v>

3725
01:30:51.211 --> 01:30:51.930
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

3726
01:30:51.930 --> 01:30:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to have surgery.</v>

3727
01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:53.671
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

3728
01:30:53.671 --> 01:30:53.851
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3729
01:30:53.851 --> 01:30:54.684
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do it.</v>

3730
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Talk to another neurosurgeon.</v>

3731
01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:57.300
<v Speaker 1>He said the same thing.</v>

3732
01:30:57.301 --> 01:31:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Then I talked to my cousin at John Hopkins and he goes,</v>

3733
01:31:01.650 --> 01:31:02.970
<v Speaker 1>you're truly a moron.</v>

3734
01:31:02.971 --> 01:31:03.930
<v Speaker 1>You have to have surgery.</v>

3735
01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:04.351
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

3736
01:31:04.351 --> 01:31:04.651
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

3737
01:31:04.651 --> 01:31:05.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do it.</v>

3738
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:08.040
<v Speaker 1>So three guys tell you three medical experts.</v>

3739
01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.280
<v Speaker 1>So I rehabbed and like,</v>

3740
01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I got this to come back.</v>

3741
01:31:10.710 --> 01:31:11.543
<v Speaker 1>How'd you do it?</v>

3742
01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3743
01:31:12.150 --> 01:31:12.983
<v Speaker 1>there was some,</v>

3744
01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:16.800
<v Speaker 1>some neural work by a guy at Palmer College of Chiropractic,</v>

3745
01:31:16.801 --> 01:31:17.790
<v Speaker 1>which is in Davenport.</v>

3746
01:31:18.330 --> 01:31:19.230
<v Speaker 1>He's uh,</v>

3747
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3748
01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:20.151
<v Speaker 1>during his,</v>

3749
01:31:20.151 --> 01:31:21.150
<v Speaker 1>his named Doctor Dave Journey.</v>

3750
01:31:21.151 --> 01:31:22.860
<v Speaker 1>He's the best athlete to ever come out of Iowa.</v>

3751
01:31:22.861 --> 01:31:23.221
<v Speaker 1>But he's a,</v>

3752
01:31:23.221 --> 01:31:25.530
<v Speaker 1>he's a genius when it comes to rebuilding the human body.</v>

3753
01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:29.280
<v Speaker 1>He was the strength and conditioning guy for us Olympic teams,</v>

3754
01:31:29.281 --> 01:31:32.070
<v Speaker 1>some of the sports and then was also on the bobsled team.</v>

3755
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Guy Was a freak.</v>

3756
01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:34.170
<v Speaker 1>So what kind of stuff did he do?</v>

3757
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:35.850
<v Speaker 1>He decompressions he,</v>

3758
01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:36.510
<v Speaker 1>he no he,</v>

3759
01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:36.961
<v Speaker 1>well that,</v>

3760
01:31:36.961 --> 01:31:40.710
<v Speaker 1>but he put me in weird positions on a table on my side and they would block</v>

3761
01:31:40.711 --> 01:31:41.220
<v Speaker 1>certain,</v>

3762
01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:44.850
<v Speaker 1>they would put pressure points to stop certain nerves from working all this</v>

3763
01:31:44.851 --> 01:31:48.960
<v Speaker 1>other stuff and tell me to move certain parts of my body and trying to get most</v>

3764
01:31:48.961 --> 01:31:53.070
<v Speaker 1>like Raul for rerouting rerouting of the nervous system and got things going</v>

3765
01:31:53.071 --> 01:31:55.920
<v Speaker 1>again and rebuilt me and I got to wear,</v>

3766
01:31:55.921 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 1>this was back to 100% it happened one other time where this side and this arms</v>

3767
01:32:00.101 --> 01:32:01.540
<v Speaker 1>two inches smaller than this one.</v>

3768
01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:01.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3769
01:32:01.991 --> 01:32:02.771
<v Speaker 1>I could see it at,</v>

3770
01:32:02.771 --> 01:32:05.440
<v Speaker 1>my shoulder's gone here quite a bit.</v>

3771
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:06.640
<v Speaker 1>There's some things I just can't do.</v>

3772
01:32:06.641 --> 01:32:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can still do pull ups in a bunch of other stuff.</v>

3773
01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.000
<v Speaker 1>There's just things I can't do.</v>

3774
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:12.100
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering if my mind was playing tricks on me.</v>

3775
01:32:12.101 --> 01:32:12.380
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

3776
01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:14.770
<v Speaker 1>it's your right arm looks boss went through the same thing.</v>

3777
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3778
01:32:15.610 --> 01:32:17.860
<v Speaker 1>And this is in your neck right now as well.</v>

3779
01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:18.713
<v Speaker 1>They've uh,</v>

3780
01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.580
<v Speaker 1>my vertebraes fused together on their own.</v>

3781
01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:23.180
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to fuse them with wild.</v>

3782
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3783
01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Chunks of bones together on their own.</v>

3784
01:32:25.421 --> 01:32:25.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3785
01:32:25.631 --> 01:32:28.690
<v Speaker 1>So the surgery that they wanted to do diffuse my vertebraes together,</v>

3786
01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:30.400
<v Speaker 1>my body did it on its own.</v>

3787
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3788
01:32:31.330 --> 01:32:32.740
<v Speaker 1>I've never even heard of such a thing.</v>

3789
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3790
01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:33.761
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3791
01:32:33.761 --> 01:32:37.180
<v Speaker 1>long enough when the disc is destroyed and dissolves and then it just all grows</v>

3792
01:32:37.181 --> 01:32:37.571
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3793
01:32:37.571 --> 01:32:39.680
<v Speaker 1>So my vertebra grew together on their luck.</v>

3794
01:32:40.050 --> 01:32:41.830
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the craziest things I've ever heard.</v>

3795
01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:42.191
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3796
01:32:42.191 --> 01:32:43.840
<v Speaker 1>So I just have to be careful listening to you.</v>

3797
01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:46.960
<v Speaker 1>I just have to be careful because I've been paralyzed twice from the neck down.</v>

3798
01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I got hit with an uppercut on the forehead.</v>

3799
01:32:48.761 --> 01:32:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't even a hard punch from Jessie Lennox.</v>

3800
01:32:51.011 --> 01:32:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I was sparring with Jesse before my last fight with Thomas Denny and he hit me</v>

3801
01:32:55.901 --> 01:32:56.450
<v Speaker 1>with an uppercut.</v>

3802
01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:57.041
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't even hard,</v>

3803
01:32:57.041 --> 01:32:59.920
<v Speaker 1>but the whiplash shut everything down from here down.</v>

3804
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:02.110
<v Speaker 1>And I went ragdoll and dropped on my knees,</v>

3805
01:33:02.230 --> 01:33:02.831
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

3806
01:33:02.831 --> 01:33:03.641
<v Speaker 1>And when I was going down,</v>

3807
01:33:03.641 --> 01:33:03.830
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

3808
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:04.660
<v Speaker 1>oh my neck.</v>

3809
01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:07.060
<v Speaker 1>And I knew that it was really bad.</v>

3810
01:33:07.061 --> 01:33:11.770
<v Speaker 1>And then another time I got cranked from underneath here and everything's shut</v>

3811
01:33:11.771 --> 01:33:12.400
<v Speaker 1>down again.</v>

3812
01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:12.821
<v Speaker 1>But right.</v>

3813
01:33:12.821 --> 01:33:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Both the cuts?</v>

3814
01:33:14.290 --> 01:33:14.591
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3815
01:33:14.591 --> 01:33:17.320
<v Speaker 1>this was a somebodies head was under the heck you're trying to bear hug me.</v>

3816
01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3817
01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:18.190
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3818
01:33:18.190 --> 01:33:18.551
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

3819
01:33:18.551 --> 01:33:21.190
<v Speaker 1>the upper cut was right before the Thomas Danny fight a couple of weeks before.</v>

3820
01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:22.210
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>

3821
01:33:22.210 --> 01:33:22.601
<v Speaker 1>well shit,</v>

3822
01:33:22.601 --> 01:33:24.010
<v Speaker 1>I can't get hit at all now.</v>

3823
01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.890
<v Speaker 1>So I went into that Thomas Denny fight and just said,</v>

3824
01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:27.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3825
01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:28.770
<v Speaker 1>he's not a powerhouse puncher.</v>

3826
01:33:28.771 --> 01:33:29.604
<v Speaker 1>I by any means,</v>

3827
01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:31.150
<v Speaker 1>but I can't get hit at all.</v>

3828
01:33:31.151 --> 01:33:34.030
<v Speaker 1>So it just danced around for the first five minutes and then knock him out early</v>

3829
01:33:34.031 --> 01:33:35.590
<v Speaker 1>in the second round and you know,</v>

3830
01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:36.910
<v Speaker 1>got out of there without getting hit.</v>

3831
01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:40.270
<v Speaker 1>But it's amazing the sense of urgency you get when you know you could be</v>

3832
01:33:40.271 --> 01:33:41.104
<v Speaker 1>paralyzed.</v>

3833
01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I wish I would.</v>

3834
01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:42.551
<v Speaker 1>I wish,</v>

3835
01:33:42.551 --> 01:33:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I wish I would have fought like that my whole career.</v>

3836
01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3837
01:33:45.730 --> 01:33:47.110
<v Speaker 1>And then you really never get hit.</v>

3838
01:33:47.230 --> 01:33:48.063
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3839
01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:51.070
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just glad my neck gave out before my brain did.</v>

3840
01:33:51.490 --> 01:33:53.050
<v Speaker 1>So your neck now,</v>

3841
01:33:53.051 --> 01:33:53.884
<v Speaker 1>how is it?</v>

3842
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3843
01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.380
<v Speaker 1>I have to be careful.</v>

3844
01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:57.311
<v Speaker 1>I still have to be careful.</v>

3845
01:33:57.311 --> 01:33:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever thought about getting one of those artificial discs?</v>

3846
01:34:00.090 --> 01:34:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3847
01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:00.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3848
01:34:00.731 --> 01:34:04.120
<v Speaker 1>that do that at this point they would have to saw my vertebraes apart and it</v>

3849
01:34:04.121 --> 01:34:06.640
<v Speaker 1>wasn't meant for her to have them see healing up like that.</v>

3850
01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:07.740
<v Speaker 1>And when they will,</v>

3851
01:34:07.741 --> 01:34:09.280
<v Speaker 1>they sealed together on their own.</v>

3852
01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.153
<v Speaker 1>It does happen.</v>

3853
01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It does happen.</v>

3854
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3855
01:34:11.710 --> 01:34:12.491
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3856
01:34:12.491 --> 01:34:15.040
<v Speaker 1>So when your right arm come back to a normal size,</v>

3857
01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:16.540
<v Speaker 1>it's been like this for years now.</v>

3858
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:17.321
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3859
01:34:17.321 --> 01:34:18.400
<v Speaker 1>I did tons of Rehab.</v>

3860
01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:19.001
<v Speaker 1>This was,</v>

3861
01:34:19.001 --> 01:34:20.200
<v Speaker 1>how long ago did this happen?</v>

3862
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:21.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3863
01:34:21.221 --> 01:34:22.600
<v Speaker 1>when I was training for the frank Trigg fight,</v>

3864
01:34:22.601 --> 01:34:23.291
<v Speaker 1>when it first happened,</v>

3865
01:34:23.291 --> 01:34:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even remember again.</v>

3866
01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:25.630
<v Speaker 1>That's what dates,</v>

3867
01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:26.171
<v Speaker 1>dates are.</v>

3868
01:34:26.171 --> 01:34:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Just think about how many fights you've called.</v>

3869
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:29.833
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3870
01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember certain years of like any fight I could name or could you pull</v>

3871
01:34:35.951 --> 01:34:36.160
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

3872
01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I see you as kind of a guy with a photographic memory,</v>

3873
01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.420
<v Speaker 1>so you're having things that are interesting.</v>

3874
01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.081
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty sharp,</v>

3875
01:34:41.081 --> 01:34:41.680
<v Speaker 1>but it was kind of like,</v>

3876
01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.500
<v Speaker 1>that's my wife.</v>

3877
01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:42.821
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

3878
01:34:42.821 --> 01:34:44.440
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker doesn't meant shit.</v>

3879
01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Very selective memory.</v>

3880
01:34:47.651 --> 01:34:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3881
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.791
<v Speaker 1>But with fights,</v>

3882
01:34:48.791 --> 01:34:50.170
<v Speaker 1>I have a particularly good memory.</v>

3883
01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I everything to me because of fighting for all those years coaching for all</v>

3884
01:34:53.711 --> 01:34:55.540
<v Speaker 1>those years and doing commentary for all those years.</v>

3885
01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:58.250
<v Speaker 1>One big massive just fights.</v>

3886
01:34:58.251 --> 01:35:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll remember the huge trig fights for sure.</v>

3887
01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:01.790
<v Speaker 1>I'll remember,</v>

3888
01:35:01.791 --> 01:35:03.140
<v Speaker 1>you know Tim went on the title,</v>

3889
01:35:03.141 --> 01:35:03.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3890
01:35:03.381 --> 01:35:04.130
<v Speaker 1>I remembered that,</v>

3891
01:35:04.130 --> 01:35:05.030
<v Speaker 1>that sort of stuff.</v>

3892
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:07.430
<v Speaker 1>But everything else is honestly but,</v>

3893
01:35:07.431 --> 01:35:12.200
<v Speaker 1>or like a Jason Black who's in a war with a guy from American top team and he</v>

3894
01:35:12.201 --> 01:35:13.370
<v Speaker 1>comes back and he sits in the,</v>

3895
01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:14.330
<v Speaker 1>sits on the stool.</v>

3896
01:35:14.331 --> 01:35:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Some of the funniest shit I've ever seen was in fights.</v>

3897
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3898
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:19.190
<v Speaker 1>You've seen it and I think you might even been calling the fight.</v>

3899
01:35:19.191 --> 01:35:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Jason Black sits down and it's been a war for two rounds of just insanity.</v>

3900
01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:25.280
<v Speaker 1>And Jason Black was a great wrestler,</v>

3901
01:35:25.281 --> 01:35:26.780
<v Speaker 1>just tough as nails kind of guy.</v>

3902
01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:27.651
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

3903
01:35:27.651 --> 01:35:28.041
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>

3904
01:35:28.041 --> 01:35:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3905
01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:30.080
<v Speaker 1>stop boxing with this guy.</v>

3906
01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Let's go out.</v>

3907
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

3908
01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.360
<v Speaker 1>let's take him down.</v>

3909
01:35:32.361 --> 01:35:33.171
<v Speaker 1>Let's get him on his back.</v>

3910
01:35:33.171 --> 01:35:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep him there.</v>

3911
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Less rough him up and let's win this round.</v>

3912
01:35:36.111 --> 01:35:38.330
<v Speaker 1>And we win the fight and we get out of here and he's doing this while I'm</v>

3913
01:35:38.331 --> 01:35:38.880
<v Speaker 1>talking to him,</v>

3914
01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.490
<v Speaker 1>he's just looking around at the crowd,</v>

3915
01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:41.531
<v Speaker 1>kind of like this.</v>

3916
01:35:41.531 --> 01:35:41.751
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

3917
01:35:41.751 --> 01:35:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>

3918
01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Jason fucking look at me.</v>

3919
01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:44.720
<v Speaker 1>And he looks at me and he goes,</v>

3920
01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:45.091
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3921
01:35:45.091 --> 01:35:45.381
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

3922
01:35:45.381 --> 01:35:46.400
<v Speaker 1>what I just tell you to do?</v>

3923
01:35:46.401 --> 01:35:47.234
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

3924
01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:48.293
<v Speaker 1>go out and dance with him.</v>

3925
01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:51.170
<v Speaker 1>And the Fertitta brothers are right there and Dana.</v>

3926
01:35:51.171 --> 01:35:53.360
<v Speaker 1>And they start laughing their asses off and I go,</v>

3927
01:35:53.361 --> 01:35:53.661
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3928
01:35:53.661 --> 01:35:54.650
<v Speaker 1>go out and do what you want to do.</v>

3929
01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.430
<v Speaker 1>So he went out,</v>

3930
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:56.450
<v Speaker 1>it turned into a brawl.</v>

3931
01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:57.290
<v Speaker 1>He ended up losing the,</v>

3932
01:35:58.670 --> 01:36:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Jason is one of the guys,</v>

3933
01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:04.010
<v Speaker 1>the first guys that I saw cut weight to the point where I was like,</v>

3934
01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:04.730
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3935
01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:09.730
<v Speaker 1>he might die when he went to 55 he was a fucking anatomy lesson.</v>

3936
01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:12.140
<v Speaker 1>You remember?</v>

3937
01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3938
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:16.400
<v Speaker 1>he sure you remember when that mother fucker had zero fat.</v>

3939
01:36:16.730 --> 01:36:17.750
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

3940
01:36:17.751 --> 01:36:19.730
<v Speaker 1>And he was really a strong guy.</v>

3941
01:36:19.731 --> 01:36:20.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was,</v>

3942
01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean if he got help position,</v>

3943
01:36:21.731 --> 01:36:22.830
<v Speaker 1>she ate it under.</v>

3944
01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>

3945
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.130
<v Speaker 1>One of the toughest guys I've ever been around.</v>

3946
01:36:25.131 --> 01:36:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he was a tweener like maybe a little too big for 52 for seven or 50</v>

3947
01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:31.400
<v Speaker 1>or 70 small for seven.</v>

3948
01:36:31.401 --> 01:36:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3949
01:36:32.150 --> 01:36:34.970
<v Speaker 1>it was a rough day or a few guys like that that would like,</v>

3950
01:36:34.971 --> 01:36:35.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3951
01:36:35.241 --> 01:36:36.590
<v Speaker 1>real world class fighters.</v>

3952
01:36:36.591 --> 01:36:40.040
<v Speaker 1>But the reality of those seventies is you're dealing with guys that are cutting</v>

3953
01:36:40.041 --> 01:36:41.390
<v Speaker 1>from two oh five and up.</v>

3954
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:44.030
<v Speaker 1>And the reality that 50 fives is that like,</v>

3955
01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:46.550
<v Speaker 1>that's not fucking horrible strain for your body.</v>

3956
01:36:47.290 --> 01:36:48.123
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

3957
01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:49.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3958
01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:52.070
<v Speaker 1>seeing guys cut weight and being a lot of trouble physically.</v>

3959
01:36:52.071 --> 01:36:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3960
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:54.620
<v Speaker 1>But our thing was always make weight no matter what.</v>

3961
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:55.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3962
01:36:55.311 --> 01:36:56.240
<v Speaker 1>that's just the way it was.</v>

3963
01:36:56.750 --> 01:37:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I think I had one guy that didn't make weight for a fight in the IFL and he got</v>

3964
01:37:00.291 --> 01:37:01.790
<v Speaker 1>run out of the gym because of it.</v>

3965
01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3966
01:37:02.170 --> 01:37:02.720
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3967
01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.480
<v Speaker 1>He just got run out of the gym because everybody was so pissed at him for not</v>

3968
01:37:05.481 --> 01:37:05.990
<v Speaker 1>making weight.</v>

3969
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.823
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3970
01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3971
01:37:07.610 --> 01:37:09.050
<v Speaker 1>seen some horrible weight cuts with people,</v>

3972
01:37:09.051 --> 01:37:11.810
<v Speaker 1>but I had to wait cut where it was in New Jersey.</v>

3973
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:14.000
<v Speaker 1>The weigh ins were the day of the fight.</v>

3974
01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Which fight was the Shonie Carter at continental airlines or remains for the day</v>

3975
01:37:17.571 --> 01:37:18.740
<v Speaker 1>of the fight that morning.</v>

3976
01:37:18.741 --> 01:37:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3977
01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3978
01:37:19.490 --> 01:37:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Just the way it was and the way it broke down,</v>

3979
01:37:21.261 --> 01:37:24.350
<v Speaker 1>the way it all went down was I had a new gym,</v>

3980
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.863
<v Speaker 1>a Gold's gym,</v>

3981
01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:27.950
<v Speaker 1>building a brand new house,</v>

3982
01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:29.120
<v Speaker 1>had a brand new baby,</v>

3983
01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:32.420
<v Speaker 1>and I had to win the fight to have enough money for the down payment on the</v>

3984
01:37:32.421 --> 01:37:32.870
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

3985
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:33.081
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3986
01:37:33.081 --> 01:37:33.681
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

3987
01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:34.514
<v Speaker 1>They're already building it.</v>

3988
01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:36.320
<v Speaker 1>We already signed the paperwork and Christ.</v>

3989
01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:39.860
<v Speaker 1>So I'm cutting weight and I've been so busy that that wasn't paying enough</v>

3990
01:37:39.861 --> 01:37:41.330
<v Speaker 1>attention to my weight and I was struggling.</v>

3991
01:37:41.331 --> 01:37:45.440
<v Speaker 1>So the whole night I stayed awake the whole night and all I thought about was,</v>

3992
01:37:45.441 --> 01:37:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I know I can beat this guy.</v>

3993
01:37:46.401 --> 01:37:47.660
<v Speaker 1>This guy is not going to beat me.</v>

3994
01:37:47.690 --> 01:37:49.800
<v Speaker 1>But if he head butts me or for whatever reason,</v>

3995
01:37:49.801 --> 01:37:52.250
<v Speaker 1>and I don't win the fight and lose that money,</v>

3996
01:37:52.251 --> 01:37:52.941
<v Speaker 1>I lose my house.</v>

3997
01:37:52.941 --> 01:37:53.391
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3998
01:37:53.391 --> 01:37:54.051
<v Speaker 1>I start to panic.</v>

3999
01:37:54.051 --> 01:37:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4000
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:55.770
<v Speaker 1>And when you're cutting weight like that,</v>

4001
01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:56.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4002
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:58.140
<v Speaker 1>everything's magnified a hundred times.</v>

4003
01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:58.590
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

4004
01:37:58.590 --> 01:37:58.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4005
01:37:58.930 --> 01:38:00.450
<v Speaker 1>just the fear and everything else.</v>

4006
01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:06.260
<v Speaker 1>And all I thought about was that water and egg white or a scrambled eggs all</v>

4007
01:38:06.391 --> 01:38:07.200
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

4008
01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:08.033
<v Speaker 1>the whole night.</v>

4009
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:09.930
<v Speaker 1>And by the time it was time to weigh in,</v>

4010
01:38:09.931 --> 01:38:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I went and knocked on Matt Hughes and Jens Pulver his door and I go,</v>

4011
01:38:12.931 --> 01:38:13.350
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

4012
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:15.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm in some serious trouble right now.</v>

4013
01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm I,</v>

4014
01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 1>because I sucked on ice cubes all night and I gained like two pounds or</v>

4015
01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:19.531
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

4016
01:38:19.531 --> 01:38:20.610
<v Speaker 1>So I had to go cut again.</v>

4017
01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:21.210
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4018
01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I just don't wait just from sucking on ice cubes all night.</v>

4019
01:38:24.301 --> 01:38:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Two pounds of ice cubes,</v>

4020
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

4021
01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:26.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4022
01:38:26.221 --> 01:38:27.570
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't even know where I was at.</v>

4023
01:38:27.571 --> 01:38:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I was losing my mind.</v>

4024
01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:28.561
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4025
01:38:28.561 --> 01:38:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:30.390
<v Speaker 1>So I did that all night.</v>

4027
01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:31.253
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

4028
01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:35.190
<v Speaker 1>so I made weight and then I went back to my hotel room and I started cramping.</v>

4029
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:36.361
<v Speaker 1>Everything cramped.</v>

4030
01:38:36.361 --> 01:38:36.841
<v Speaker 1>I at the time,</v>

4031
01:38:36.841 --> 01:38:40.170
<v Speaker 1>my wrestling shoes on as tight as I could possibly tie them so my feet wouldn't</v>

4032
01:38:40.171 --> 01:38:41.004
<v Speaker 1>bend like this.</v>

4033
01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4034
01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

4035
01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.560
<v Speaker 1>And then my cat started cramping.</v>

4036
01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Everything cramped to the point where I was curled up in the fetal position and</v>

4037
01:38:47.251 --> 01:38:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I knew I had to fight that night.</v>

4038
01:38:48.810 --> 01:38:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

4039
01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:50.881
<v Speaker 1>So I couldn't see.</v>

4143
01:40:44.490 --> 01:40:46.980
<v Speaker 1>And so the first round I just took Shoney down.</v>

4144
01:40:46.981 --> 01:40:47.431
<v Speaker 1>I threw him,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just not going overboard.</v>

4151
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:57.830
<v Speaker 1>But I wanted him to be tired going into the second round.</v>

4152
01:40:57.831 --> 01:40:59.680
<v Speaker 1>How diminish to you in this state?</v>

4153

4162
01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:07.000
<v Speaker 1>So I just,</v>

4163
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.440
<v Speaker 1>I had kicked him and knock him out.</v>

4164
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I remember that and I just went,</v>

4165
01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I made it out of that with the skin of my teeth.</v>

4166
01:41:12.690 --> 01:41:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

4167
01:41:13.210 --> 01:41:13.630
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4168
01:41:13.630 --> 01:41:16.720
<v Speaker 1>But so it's just weight cutting can be very extreme.</v>

4169
01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:17.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4170
01:41:17.351 --> 01:41:17.951
<v Speaker 1>It really can.</v>

4171
01:41:17.951 --> 01:41:19.930
<v Speaker 1>But we always believed in that you have to make weight,</v>

4172
01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:20.771
<v Speaker 1>then you sign your name.</v>

4173
01:41:20.771 --> 01:41:24.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I get so pissed off and disgusted when people don't make what.</v>

4174
01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4175
01:41:24.930 --> 01:41:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4176
01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:27.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a lack of discipline for sure.</v>

4177
01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:27.730
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

4178
01:41:27.730 --> 01:41:30.370
<v Speaker 1>unless it's not physically possible for you to make the weight.</v>

4179
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a heavyweight and you want to make lightweight,</v>

4180
01:41:32.231 --> 01:41:33.370
<v Speaker 1>that's not physically possible.</v>

4181
01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:33.641
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4182
01:41:33.641 --> 01:41:34.510
<v Speaker 1>So then don't sign it.</v>

4183
01:41:34.511 --> 01:41:35.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a lack of commitment.</v>

4184
01:41:35.561 --> 01:41:35.711
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

4185
01:41:35.711 --> 01:41:36.640
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that I,</v>

4186
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm disgusted most with,</v>

4187
01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:38.710
<v Speaker 1>is that people don't,</v>

4188
01:41:38.710 --> 01:41:39.820
<v Speaker 1>aren't committed to what they do.</v>

4189
01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4190
01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:42.640
<v Speaker 1>You've obviously committed to what you do.</v>

4191
01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:44.110
<v Speaker 1>You're very good at the things that you do,</v>

4192
01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:44.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4193
01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:45.041
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

4194
01:41:45.041 --> 01:41:45.551
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious.</v>

4195
01:41:45.551 --> 01:41:46.660
<v Speaker 1>You're obviously a talented guy,</v>

4196
01:41:46.661 --> 01:41:47.860
<v Speaker 1>but you work at your craft.</v>

4197
01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:48.813
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4198
01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:49.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4199
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:50.150
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

4200
01:41:50.150 --> 01:41:51.850
<v Speaker 1>there came a time where I had to leave college,</v>

4201
01:41:51.851 --> 01:41:56.080
<v Speaker 1>just go home and take care of my alien mother and had to work three jobs and</v>

4202
01:41:56.081 --> 01:42:00.280
<v Speaker 1>realized sitting in a basement that that was raised in every time it rained,</v>

4203
01:42:00.281 --> 01:42:00.850
<v Speaker 1>it flooded.</v>

4204
01:42:00.850 --> 01:42:01.900
<v Speaker 1>My feet were in water.</v>

4205
01:42:01.901 --> 01:42:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I woke up one morning and that was doing,</v>

4206
01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:03.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4207
01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:06.250
<v Speaker 1>I had started out fighting and everything and I said,</v>

4208
01:42:06.251 --> 01:42:06.820
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

4209
01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:07.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to win a world title.</v>

4210
01:42:07.721 --> 01:42:08.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean the winning the UFC title,</v>

4211
01:42:09.010 --> 01:42:09.790
<v Speaker 1>what's it?</v>

4212
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:10.623
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

4213
01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:15.700
<v Speaker 1>And I loaded a nine millimeter pistol and I put a round in the chamber and I put</v>

4214
01:42:15.701 --> 01:42:16.720
<v Speaker 1>it in my sock drawer and I said,</v>

4215
01:42:16.721 --> 01:42:19.180
<v Speaker 1>if I don't want a world title that Gun's going in my mouth and I'm done,</v>

4216
01:42:20.050 --> 01:42:20.830
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

4217
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4218
01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:22.750
<v Speaker 1>So every time I fought,</v>

4219
01:42:23.290 --> 01:42:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I thought about that gun in my sock drawer and not wanting to go home to it.</v>

4220
01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:27.011
<v Speaker 1>And that's just,</v>

4221
01:42:27.011 --> 01:42:27.760
<v Speaker 1>that's commitment.</v>

4222
01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:28.593
<v Speaker 1>That was my,</v>

4223
01:42:28.690 --> 01:42:31.360
<v Speaker 1>that's what was needed for me to succeed at that point in my life.</v>

4224
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:32.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it was.</v>

4225
01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:35.980
<v Speaker 1>So when I see people not when they're talented and they're not committed,</v>

4226
01:42:36.010 --> 01:42:37.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anything to do with them.</v>

4227
01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:38.133
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

4228
01:42:38.170 --> 01:42:39.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time for people like that.</v>

4229
01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:42.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a guy who's committed and sucks and training every day.</v>

4230
01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4231
01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Because I love his commitment.</v>

4232
01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:45.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4233
01:42:45.221 --> 01:42:48.640
<v Speaker 1>there's some guys that just make some real critical errors,</v>

4234
01:42:48.641 --> 01:42:49.840
<v Speaker 1>but they're incredibly talented.</v>

4235
01:42:49.841 --> 01:42:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Like Norma Gum head off.</v>

4236
01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:51.311
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4237
01:42:51.311 --> 01:42:51.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4238
01:42:51.551 --> 01:42:53.680
<v Speaker 1>when he missed fight the fight with Tony Ferguson,</v>

4239
01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:54.941
<v Speaker 1>he literally,</v>

4240
01:42:54.941 --> 01:42:56.260
<v Speaker 1>his body was shutting down.</v>

4241
01:42:56.261 --> 01:42:57.610
<v Speaker 1>They'd had to take him to the hospital.</v>

4242
01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I'll comes to preparation though.</v>

4243
01:42:58.720 --> 01:42:59.740
<v Speaker 1>She didn't red haired better.</v>

4244
01:42:59.770 --> 01:43:00.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4245
01:43:00.041 --> 01:43:02.380
<v Speaker 1>He should have gotten lighter beforehand.</v>

4246
01:43:02.381 --> 01:43:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Should've watched the Diet.</v>

4247
01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Now that he has a nutritionist,</v>

4248
01:43:05.171 --> 01:43:07.930
<v Speaker 1>he made weighed pretty easy for his last fight with Barboza and now he's going</v>

4249
01:43:07.931 --> 01:43:09.700
<v Speaker 1>to be fighting for the title and the guy's a monster.</v>

4250
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:10.900
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking monster.</v>

4251
01:43:10.901 --> 01:43:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4252
01:43:11.290 --> 01:43:11.951
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

4253
01:43:11.951 --> 01:43:13.510
<v Speaker 1>aspirin had a real good point.</v>

4254
01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4255
01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:16.420
<v Speaker 1>what they do with one fc I think is the way to do it.</v>

4256
01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:17.051
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4257
01:43:17.051 --> 01:43:17.861
<v Speaker 1>with one FC,</v>

4258
01:43:17.861 --> 01:43:18.641
<v Speaker 1>they test you,</v>

4259
01:43:18.641 --> 01:43:22.720
<v Speaker 1>they have a hydration test and they test you and whatever weight the champions</v>

4260
01:43:22.721 --> 01:43:23.200
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

4261
01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:26.650
<v Speaker 1>they just bumped everybody up a notch and they bumped him up to one 85.</v>

4262
01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4263
01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:27.430
<v Speaker 1>He'll like,</v>

4264
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:28.570
<v Speaker 1>there's no cutting weight here.</v>

4265
01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:32.770
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's just an unfortunate part of martial arts is this weight</v>

4266
01:43:32.771 --> 01:43:33.604
<v Speaker 1>cutting shit,</v>

4267
01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:34.450
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>

4268
01:43:34.450 --> 01:43:34.900
<v Speaker 1>boxing,</v>

4269
01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:35.340
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

4270
01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:35.890
<v Speaker 1>think about,</v>

4271
01:43:35.890 --> 01:43:36.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4272
01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:37.320
<v Speaker 1>they complained about the,</v>

4273
01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:39.280
<v Speaker 1>the fighters cutting weight.</v>

4274
01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:40.173
<v Speaker 1>That's for,</v>

4275
01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:40.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4276
01:43:40.811 --> 01:43:41.111
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

4277
01:43:41.111 --> 01:43:42.190
<v Speaker 1>four times a year.</v>

4278
01:43:42.250 --> 01:43:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Really not that hard.</v>

4279
01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4280
01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Try cutting weight your entire life every wrestling season.</v>

4281
01:43:47.770 --> 01:43:49.330
<v Speaker 1>And when you Russell during the winter,</v>

4282
01:43:49.570 --> 01:43:50.201
<v Speaker 1>then spring,</v>

4283
01:43:50.201 --> 01:43:51.650
<v Speaker 1>summer for freestyle and Greco.</v>

4284
01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4285
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:56.090
<v Speaker 2>That was probably the thing that made me so small compared to my brothers.</v>

4286
01:43:56.091 --> 01:43:56.601
<v Speaker 2>They were all six,</v>

4287
01:43:56.601 --> 01:43:56.781
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

4288
01:43:56.781 --> 01:43:56.991
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

4289
01:43:56.991 --> 01:43:58.040
<v Speaker 2>five sure is.</v>

4290
01:43:58.041 --> 01:44:01.310
<v Speaker 2>I cut weight from sixth grade all the way through high school and into college</v>

4291
01:44:01.311 --> 01:44:02.144
<v Speaker 2>and then fighting.</v>

4292
01:44:02.150 --> 01:44:02.421
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4293
01:44:02.421 --> 01:44:02.810
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>

4294
01:44:02.810 --> 01:44:04.280
<v Speaker 2>during my growing years though,</v>

4295
01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:05.443
<v Speaker 2>I was starving.</v>

4296
01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4297
01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:06.860
<v Speaker 2>That's just the way it was.</v>

4298
01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:08.840
<v Speaker 2>And so it stunted my growth most likely.</v>

4299
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:09.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it did.</v>

4300
01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:10.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4301
01:44:10.101 --> 01:44:10.370
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

4302
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I knew a lot of guys from wrestling that were like that.</v>

4303
01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.910
<v Speaker 2>The brothers were big and they were small,</v>

4304
01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:16.730
<v Speaker 2>but I think that it's just unnecessary for MMA.</v>

4305
01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:16.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4306
01:44:16.941 --> 01:44:19.880
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with professional athletes at the highest level of the game.</v>

4307
01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.710
<v Speaker 2>I think they should just cut it out.</v>

4308
01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:23.940
<v Speaker 2>I just think they should implement going to happen though.</v>

4309
01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's going to look at the drive.</v>

4310
01:44:25.890 --> 01:44:27.770
<v Speaker 2>See if they do the one FC rules.</v>

4311
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:29.270
<v Speaker 2>They test you three times.</v>

4312
01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:30.351
<v Speaker 2>They test your weight,</v>

4313
01:44:30.351 --> 01:44:31.490
<v Speaker 2>they get a base weight off of you.</v>

4314
01:44:31.491 --> 01:44:32.510
<v Speaker 2>They get hydration levels.</v>

4315
01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has to follow that same look.</v>

4316
01:44:35.451 --> 01:44:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has to follow the Usada rules.</v>

4317
01:44:37.490 --> 01:44:38.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

4318
01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:38.781
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>

4319
01:44:38.781 --> 01:44:39.200
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4320
01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:40.640
<v Speaker 2>the rules like in,</v>

4321
01:44:40.670 --> 01:44:44.120
<v Speaker 2>in reference to guys using performance enhancing drugs,</v>

4322
01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:48.080
<v Speaker 2>it's just as critical to keep guys from fighting dehydrated or from being</v>

4323
01:44:48.081 --> 01:44:48.914
<v Speaker 2>dehydrated.</v>

4324
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:49.823
<v Speaker 2>Now it's,</v>

4325
01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:51.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously there's risks.</v>

4326
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:52.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4327
01:44:52.130 --> 01:44:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Fighting dehydrated.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4357
01:45:40.130 --> 01:45:40.963
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a peek ahead,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you just had to go way back now we alive.</v>

4362
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:47.480
<v Speaker 3>Joe Camacho.</v>

4363
01:45:47.690 --> 01:45:48.370
<v Speaker 3>I needed a bucket.</v>

4364
01:45:48.370 --> 01:45:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Joey Camacho.</v>

4365
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:50.090
<v Speaker 3>That's who it was.</v>

4366
01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:51.193
<v Speaker 3>Joey Camacho.</v>

4367
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:52.521
<v Speaker 3>I remembered that.</v>

4368
01:45:52.521 --> 01:45:53.300
<v Speaker 3>That was horrific.</v>

4369
01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:54.890
<v Speaker 3>That was 2000 man.</v>

4370
01:45:54.891 --> 01:45:55.790
<v Speaker 3>Time flies.</v>

4371
01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:57.013
<v Speaker 3>How crazy.</v>

4372
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:58.051
<v Speaker 3>Cut.</v>

4373
01:45:58.051 --> 01:45:58.884
<v Speaker 3>Melted.</v>

4374
01:45:59.240 --> 01:45:59.990
<v Speaker 3>Tough guy.</v>

4375
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.920
<v Speaker 3>Can't hold his piss.</v>

4376
01:46:01.130 --> 01:46:01.963
<v Speaker 3>Now we know.</v>

4377
01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:03.950
<v Speaker 3>That's probably why I had a hard time cutting weight.</v>

4378
01:46:04.150 --> 01:46:05.030
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

4379
01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:06.403
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4380
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:07.540
<v Speaker 3>pull that fight up.</v>

01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:10.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna see that fight and make you a Arturo Gotti.</v>

4382
01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Joey Camacho.</v>

4383
01:46:12.050 --> 01:46:13.280
<v Speaker 3>That was a disturbing one.</v>

4384
01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:17.480
<v Speaker 3>The thing is like you see so many of those kind of Kaos in MMA.</v>

4385
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:18.950
<v Speaker 3>It makes you realize,</v>

01:46:20.511 --> 01:46:25.220

4389
01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:30.230
<v Speaker 3>this is Arturo Gotti when he was really world class two at the top of his game.</v>

4390
01:46:30.750 --> 01:46:32.510
<v Speaker 3>What they're working on a movie or something.</v>

4391
01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:33.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4393
01:46:33.531 --> 01:46:36.560
<v Speaker 3>he was killed by his girlfriend and just killed by his girlfriend.</v>

4394
01:46:36.561 --> 01:46:37.910
<v Speaker 3>She got away with it or his wife,</v>

4395
01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:42.050
<v Speaker 3>his wife was this Brazilian chick and she got out of jail when she got out of</v>

4396
01:46:42.051 --> 01:46:42.291
<v Speaker 3>jail.</v>

4397
01:46:42.291 --> 01:46:43.130
<v Speaker 3>She was smiling.</v>

4398
01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:44.240
<v Speaker 3>It's really disturbing.</v>

4399
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:46.010
<v Speaker 3>He got clipped there with a left hook.</v>

4400
01:46:46.730 --> 01:46:47.840
<v Speaker 3>It was real bad.</v>

4401
01:46:47.841 --> 01:46:48.141
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4402
01:46:48.141 --> 01:46:48.974
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4403
01:46:49.410 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 3>they think that</v>

4404
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:50.843
<v Speaker 2>there was some severe,</v>

4405
01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:51.061
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4406
01:46:51.061 --> 01:46:51.900
<v Speaker 2>there's the KL.</v>

4407
01:46:52.230 --> 01:46:54.490
<v Speaker 2>They think there's some severe uh,</v>

4408
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:56.730
<v Speaker 2>corruption involved in her,</v>

4409
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:57.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4410
01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:57.990
<v Speaker 2>her acquittal,</v>

4411
01:46:57.990 --> 01:47:01.830
<v Speaker 2>cause she got acquitted in Brazil and they said that he was,</v>

4412
01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:03.390
<v Speaker 2>he committed suicide,</v>

4413
01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:07.020
<v Speaker 2>but he had some sort of blunt force trauma on his head.</v>

4414
01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:07.801
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

4415
01:47:07.801 --> 01:47:09.990
<v Speaker 2>it was a big deal and it was very,</v>

4416
01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:13.230
<v Speaker 2>it was very sad for a lot of people that were Arturo Gotti fans because</v>

4417
01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:16.860
<v Speaker 2>his fights with Micky ward were,</v>

4418
01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:20.460
<v Speaker 2>there's fights where guys are matched perfectly,</v>

4419
01:47:20.670 --> 01:47:22.860
<v Speaker 2>where it's like their skill level.</v>

4420
01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:25.640
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about a Turo Gadi and Micky Ward and how God,</v>

4421
01:47:25.650 --> 01:47:28.050
<v Speaker 2>he was a pat Miletich returns from the restroom.</v>

4422
01:47:28.290 --> 01:47:29.640
<v Speaker 2>How God he was,</v>

4423
01:47:29.641 --> 01:47:30.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4424
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:32.010
<v Speaker 2>killed by his girlfriend or his wife.</v>

4425
01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4426
01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:33.750
<v Speaker 2>And acquitted.</v>

4427
01:47:33.930 --> 01:47:37.080
<v Speaker 2>She was acquitted and it's like pretty obvious it's someone murdered them and</v>

4428
01:47:37.081 --> 01:47:38.490
<v Speaker 2>they pass it off as a,</v>

4429
01:47:38.491 --> 01:47:39.324
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4430
01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.090
<v Speaker 2>as a suicide and then because of domestic or something.</v>

4431
01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:42.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4432
01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:43.290
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4433
01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:44.330
<v Speaker 2>She fucking killed him,</v>

4434
01:47:44.331 --> 01:47:44.940
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4435
01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:46.410
<v Speaker 2>And when she got out of jail,</v>

4436
01:47:46.411 --> 01:47:47.550
<v Speaker 2>she was smiling.</v>

4437
01:47:47.551 --> 01:47:48.240
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

4438
01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:49.230
<v Speaker 2>she's like taking,</v>

4439
01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:51.660
<v Speaker 2>they're taking pictures of her leaving jail.</v>

4440
01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:53.820
<v Speaker 2>I think there's just a Brazil job.</v>

4441
01:47:53.850 --> 01:47:56.610
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't you no corruption in Brazil is bad,</v>

4442
01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:57.211
<v Speaker 2>is bad.</v>

4443
01:47:57.211 --> 01:47:57.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4444
01:47:57.540 --> 01:47:59.610
<v Speaker 2>they tried to get rid of the fucking president recently.</v>

4445
01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4446
01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:01.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened with that.</v>

4447
01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:02.640
<v Speaker 2>They were just stealing money,</v>

4448
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:03.370
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

4449
01:48:03.370 --> 01:48:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4450
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:08.040
<v Speaker 2>There's some severe corruption in Brazil and apparently in this case most people</v>

4451
01:48:08.041 --> 01:48:11.190
<v Speaker 2>think that she killed him and that she got away with it.</v>

4452
01:48:11.191 --> 01:48:11.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4453
01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:13.830
<v Speaker 2>To get an understanding too of the Brazilian people,</v>

4454
01:48:13.831 --> 01:48:15.200
<v Speaker 2>you have to read a book called um,</v>

4455
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:16.223
<v Speaker 2>to Guerrero.</v>

4456
01:48:16.810 --> 01:48:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Never heard of that.</v>

4457
01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:18.253
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4458
01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:19.800
<v Speaker 2>I saw the city of God though.</v>

4459
01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4460
01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:23.070
<v Speaker 2>You want to understand fucking Brazilians.</v>

4461
01:48:23.071 --> 01:48:23.761
<v Speaker 2>Watch that movie.</v>

4462
01:48:23.761 --> 01:48:24.510
<v Speaker 2>City of God.</v>

4463
01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:25.201
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of it.</v>

4464
01:48:25.201 --> 01:48:26.310
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

4465
01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:27.830
<v Speaker 2>It was just tell me about this movie.</v>

4466
01:48:27.831 --> 01:48:28.970
<v Speaker 2>And so ultra,</v>

4467
01:48:29.050 --> 01:48:34.050
<v Speaker 2>ultra rare or to Guerrero was a book about Sasha and Ernst Simmel to Russians</v>

4468
01:48:34.531 --> 01:48:39.531
<v Speaker 2>who had engineering degrees who went to Brazil around 1920 1921 during the</v>

4469
01:48:39.901 --> 01:48:40.734
<v Speaker 2>diamond rush.</v>

4470
01:48:40.770 --> 01:48:41.603
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4471
01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:42.750
<v Speaker 2>And this was when,</v>

4472
01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:44.380
<v Speaker 2>ironically I think when the,</v>

4473
01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:46.200
<v Speaker 2>the Gracie started learning Jujitsu,</v>

4474
01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:47.940
<v Speaker 2>right about the same,</v>

4475
01:48:47.941 --> 01:48:48.870
<v Speaker 2>about the same area.</v>

4476
01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:53.580
<v Speaker 2>So Ernst and Sasha [inaudible] both were catch wrestling guys and boxers and it</v>

4477
01:48:53.581 --> 01:48:54.720
<v Speaker 2>just tough Russians,</v>

4478
01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:55.160
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4479
01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:56.400
<v Speaker 2>We know how tough Russians are.</v>

4480
01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:58.073
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

4481
01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:02.370
<v Speaker 2>they are working their way through Brazil and through the Mato Grosso,</v>

4482
01:49:02.371 --> 01:49:04.860
<v Speaker 2>stopping at ranches and towns fixing guns.</v>

4483
01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Cause the Brazilians didn't know how to fix our guns to pay their way further in</v>

4484
01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:11.700
<v Speaker 2>as they were getting towards the rivers and all that sort of stuff.</v>

4485
01:49:11.770 --> 01:49:14.130
<v Speaker 2>And to find diamonds is that that was our thing.</v>

4486
01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:15.930
<v Speaker 2>But during all of this,</v>

4487
01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:17.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4488
01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Sasha semel was fighting,</v>

4489
01:49:20.210 --> 01:49:24.300
<v Speaker 2>no holds barred fights against Paraguayan strong men and all this sort of stuff</v>

4490
01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:25.340
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

4491
01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:25.801
<v Speaker 2>in the ring.</v>

4492
01:49:25.801 --> 01:49:30.330
<v Speaker 2>And then he became a guy who was what's called a to guerrera guy who can use a</v>

4493
01:49:30.331 --> 01:49:33.390
<v Speaker 2>spear and kill one of the big cats in the jungles back then that was killing the</v>

4494
01:49:33.391 --> 01:49:34.224
<v Speaker 2>cattle,</v>

4495
01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:35.550
<v Speaker 2>killing the ranch hands,</v>

4496
01:49:35.551 --> 01:49:36.181
<v Speaker 2>all this sort of stuff.</v>

4497
01:49:36.181 --> 01:49:37.380
<v Speaker 2>These are 400 pound cats,</v>

4498
01:49:37.381 --> 01:49:37.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4499
01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:39.990
<v Speaker 2>These are big scary panthers in the jungle.</v>

4500
01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:43.710
<v Speaker 2>So he went and sought out and found a,</v>

4501
01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:48.220
<v Speaker 2>a Indian or Brazilian Indian who was supposedly</v>

4502
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:48.311
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

4503
01:49:48.311 --> 01:49:49.360
<v Speaker 1>took rare the expert.</v>

4504
01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:51.640
<v Speaker 1>And he found this guy and the guy's just drunk,</v>

4505
01:49:51.730 --> 01:49:52.630
<v Speaker 1>just completely drunk.</v>

4506
01:49:53.110 --> 01:49:53.411
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

4507
01:49:53.411 --> 01:49:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I want you to take me and teach me how to do this.</v>

4508
01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:59.320
<v Speaker 1>And so they go and the guys drinking the whole time and he goes,</v>

4509
01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:01.210
<v Speaker 1>they run across a big cat.</v>

4510
01:50:01.211 --> 01:50:05.620
<v Speaker 1>And what these cats would do is riflemen on horses would go track the cats,</v>

4511
01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:07.510
<v Speaker 1>the cats would double back on them,</v>

4512
01:50:07.630 --> 01:50:08.800
<v Speaker 1>take them off their horse and kill them,</v>

4513
01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:09.191
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4514
01:50:09.191 --> 01:50:10.270
<v Speaker 1>So they were killing rifleman.</v>

4515
01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:11.650
<v Speaker 1>So these cats were smart.</v>

4516
01:50:12.850 --> 01:50:14.350
<v Speaker 1>So this guy taught him though.</v>

4517
01:50:14.351 --> 01:50:17.710
<v Speaker 1>He watched this guy drunk kill a 400 pound cat with a spear.</v>

4518
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:20.260
<v Speaker 1>And then he taught him how they would sit on their paws,</v>

4519
01:50:20.261 --> 01:50:21.790
<v Speaker 1>whether they were going high to attack you,</v>

4520
01:50:21.791 --> 01:50:22.900
<v Speaker 1>whether they were coming low,</v>

4521
01:50:22.901 --> 01:50:24.040
<v Speaker 1>how to position the spear,</v>

4522
01:50:24.041 --> 01:50:24.874
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of stuff.</v>

4523
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:26.190
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4524
01:50:26.190 --> 01:50:26.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4525
01:50:26.590 --> 01:50:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Sasha semel became a white guy who'd killed 33 big cats for ranches,</v>

4526
01:50:30.850 --> 01:50:31.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4527
01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Why this beer?</v>

4528
01:50:32.630 --> 01:50:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4529
01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:33.761
<v Speaker 1>it's the coolest.</v>

4530
01:50:33.761 --> 01:50:34.361
<v Speaker 1>It's the coolest,</v>

4531
01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:35.560
<v Speaker 1>but you couldn't write it any better.</v>

4532
01:50:35.561 --> 01:50:38.140
<v Speaker 1>But to tell you about the Brazilian mindset,</v>

4533
01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:39.400
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy in one of the,</v>

4534
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:40.331
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4535
01:50:40.331 --> 01:50:45.331
<v Speaker 1>gun Smith blacksmith shops where they were fixing guns for people that this one</v>

4536
01:50:45.941 --> 01:50:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian had an attitude and Sasha insulted him in front of the friends.</v>

4537
01:50:50.530 --> 01:50:51.520
<v Speaker 1>So this guy,</v>

4538
01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:54.190
<v Speaker 1>then once you insulted Brazilian back in those days,</v>

4539
01:50:54.191 --> 01:50:54.670
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

4540
01:50:54.670 --> 01:50:57.520
<v Speaker 1>they have to kill you because you disrespected them so badly in front of their</v>

4541
01:50:57.521 --> 01:50:59.540
<v Speaker 1>family and friends and that that's,</v>

4542
01:50:59.590 --> 01:51:00.670
<v Speaker 1>they're just hot blooded people,</v>

4543
01:51:00.671 --> 01:51:01.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4544
01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:02.780
<v Speaker 1>You've been around enough resilience.</v>

4545
01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:03.850
<v Speaker 1>They're hot blooded people,</v>

4546
01:51:03.851 --> 01:51:05.560
<v Speaker 1>a Vandelay Silva when he loses his temper,</v>

4547
01:51:05.561 --> 01:51:06.670
<v Speaker 1>and it's a pretty scary dude.</v>

4548
01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:12.100
<v Speaker 1>So this guy tracks them for awhile and then they hire a guy that's the sheriff</v>

4549
01:51:12.101 --> 01:51:16.750
<v Speaker 1>of Pasa Fundo who has a necklace of human ears to prove he brings back the ears</v>

4550
01:51:16.751 --> 01:51:18.100
<v Speaker 1>of the person you paid him to kill,</v>

4551
01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:19.780
<v Speaker 1>and that's how he got paid.</v>

4552
01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:20.141
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4553
01:51:20.141 --> 01:51:22.780
<v Speaker 1>So he had a necklace of human ears and he was hunting Sasha,</v>

4554
01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:23.081
<v Speaker 1>or it's,</v>

4555
01:51:23.081 --> 01:51:24.310
<v Speaker 1>it's the coolest book you've ever read.</v>

4556
01:51:24.670 --> 01:51:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4557
01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:26.190
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible to her,</v>

4558
01:51:26.590 --> 01:51:28.040
<v Speaker 1>to Grerrero Tig,</v>

4559

4561
01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:30.400

4562
01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:31.233
<v Speaker 1>O,</v>

4563
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:32.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's a rare book.</v>

4564
01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:33.400
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine,</v>

4565
01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Amsti Tig,</v>

4566
01:51:34.810 --> 01:51:35.940
<v Speaker 1>r e R.</v>

4567
01:51:35.941 --> 01:51:36.240
<v Speaker 1>O.</v>

4568
01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:36.670
<v Speaker 1>R.</v>

4569
01:51:36.670 --> 01:51:37.060
<v Speaker 1>O.</v>

4570
01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:37.893
<v Speaker 1>Two Guerrero.</v>

4571
01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:38.891
<v Speaker 1>It's a rare book.</v>

4572
01:51:38.891 --> 01:51:39.730
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find,</v>

4573
01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:42.640
<v Speaker 1>and John Wayne was going to make a movie about it,</v>

4574
01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:44.680
<v Speaker 1>but they couldn't do the movie.</v>

4575
01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:46.720
<v Speaker 1>They were going to do it in the 50s or whatever it was,</v>

4576
01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:49.450
<v Speaker 1>but they couldn't because the Amazon was still too dangerous.</v>

4577
01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:52.160
<v Speaker 1>There's cannibals everywhere and all kinds of stuff and you know,</v>

4578
01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:53.530
<v Speaker 1>malaria and everything else.</v>

4579
01:51:53.531 --> 01:51:54.310
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

4580
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:59.310
<v Speaker 1>there's actually a documentary about going there to do the site surveys and all</v>

4581
01:51:59.501 --> 01:52:00.101
<v Speaker 1>that sort of stuff.</v>

4582
01:52:00.101 --> 01:52:00.800
<v Speaker 1>And they went,</v>

4583
01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.560
<v Speaker 1>you have malaria and South America?</v>

4584
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

4585
01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:03.791
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

4586
01:52:03.791 --> 01:52:06.760
<v Speaker 1>malaria is just an Amazon in the Amazon and stuff like that.</v>

4587
01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:07.893
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4588
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:09.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they've got plenty of diseases,</v>

4589
01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:09.921
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

4590
01:52:09.921 --> 01:52:10.520

4593
01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:15.310
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4594
01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:15.620
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4595
01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:16.341
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard of that.</v>

4596
01:52:16.341 --> 01:52:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4597
01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:20.660
<v Speaker 3>The Lost City of Z is a book that they turned into a movie a couple of years ago</v>

4598
01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:25.370
<v Speaker 3>about this guy and it turned out that what he had discovered has now been proven</v>

4599
01:52:25.371 --> 01:52:27.740
<v Speaker 3>that there was some ancient systems.</v>

4600
01:52:27.741 --> 01:52:28.310
<v Speaker 3>They're a,</v>

4601
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:29.143
<v Speaker 3>some ancient,</v>

4602
01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:30.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4603
01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:31.010
<v Speaker 3>civilizations,</v>

4604
01:52:31.010 --> 01:52:31.821
<v Speaker 3>civilization,</v>

4605
01:52:31.821 --> 01:52:33.710
<v Speaker 3>but also irrigation systems.</v>

4606
01:52:33.711 --> 01:52:34.091
<v Speaker 3>And they've,</v>

4607
01:52:34.091 --> 01:52:37.430
<v Speaker 3>they've figured out that they had all these roads and stuff because of satellite</v>

4608
01:52:37.431 --> 01:52:41.960
<v Speaker 3>imagery there and some new technology where they can look through the bushes and</v>

4609
01:52:41.961 --> 01:52:42.291
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

4610
01:52:42.291 --> 01:52:45.650
<v Speaker 3>the jungle foliage and stuff and these and</v>

4611
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.903
<v Speaker 2>roads and everything.</v>

4612
01:52:47.410 --> 01:52:48.120
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

4613
01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:48.870
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

4614
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:49.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4615
01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:49.940
<v Speaker 2>there he is.</v>

4616
01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:50.773
<v Speaker 2>That's him.</v>

4617
01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Is that a spear right next to him?</v>

4618
01:52:51.981 --> 01:52:53.500
<v Speaker 2>There's pictures of gunner,</v>

4619
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:55.180
<v Speaker 2>a spear gun with a bandit on it.</v>

4620
01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

4621
01:52:55.580 --> 01:53:00.470
<v Speaker 2>But there's pictures of him with spears going up against cats to Jesus Christ.</v>

4622
01:53:00.471 --> 01:53:01.304
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

4623
01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:02.960
<v Speaker 2>he was hardcore,</v>

4624
01:53:02.961 --> 01:53:03.794
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4625
01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:05.690
<v Speaker 2>There's this beer that's a spear,</v>

4626
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:07.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's a fucking animal.</v>

4627
01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Jesus cried.</v>

4628
01:53:08.721 --> 01:53:09.650
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

4629
01:53:09.651 --> 01:53:10.251
<v Speaker 2>I think about that.</v>

4630
01:53:10.251 --> 01:53:11.270
<v Speaker 2>I spoke to his son.</v>

4631
01:53:11.271 --> 01:53:11.510
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

4632
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:12.343
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

4633
01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:15.110
<v Speaker 2>I was writing the screenplay on his life.</v>

4634
01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4635
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:17.000
<v Speaker 2>And I talked to his son,</v>

4636
01:53:17.001 --> 01:53:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Sasha junior about it.</v>

4637
01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:20.120
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

4638
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:23.390
<v Speaker 2>he eventually just didn't want to do the life rights thing and all that.</v>

4639
01:53:23.391 --> 01:53:25.400
<v Speaker 2>And what if the eight though the Jaguars,</v>

4640
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:26.660
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

4641
01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Do you know mountain lions?</v>

4642
01:53:28.671 --> 01:53:29.504
<v Speaker 2>Delicious?</v>

4643
01:53:29.660 --> 01:53:30.493
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

4644
01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:31.550
<v Speaker 2>I have people that say so.</v>

4645
01:53:31.551 --> 01:53:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Their favorite food.</v>

4646
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

4647
01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:33.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4648
01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:34.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4649
01:53:34.281 --> 01:53:36.110
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea you could even eat it,</v>

4650
01:53:36.111 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's apparently a more delicious version of pork.</v>

4651
01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4652

4654
01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:43.310
<v Speaker 2>like the back loin.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's things I'll eat and things I won't,</v>

4659
01:53:47.661 --> 01:53:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'd eat a predator.</v>

4660
01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I eat the fuck out of a mountain line.</v>

4665
01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

4670
01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I saw that one and I saw one of them in Santa Barbara.</v>

4671
01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:01.060

4673
01:54:03.831 --> 01:54:07.070
<v Speaker 2>and I saw this thing run across the road and at first I thought it was a coyote.</v>

4674
01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Then it saw the tail and I went,</v>

4675
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:09.681
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

4702
01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:46.240
<v Speaker 2>symbolizes our intrusion into the wild world and the consequences of it.</v>

4703

<v Speaker 2>There's an enormous cat that lives in the Hollywood hills and there's a photo of</v>

4731
01:55:23.841 --> 01:55:24.410
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

4732

01:55:26.301 --> 01:55:27.130
<v Speaker 2>they're everywhere.</v>

4736
01:55:27.130 --> 01:55:27.963
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking everywhere.</v>

4737
01:55:27.970 --> 01:55:29.930
<v Speaker 2>When killed my chicken just two days ago.</v>

4738
01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

4739
01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:30.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4740
01:55:30.591 --> 01:55:31.231
<v Speaker 2>I have chickens.</v>

4741
01:55:31.231 --> 01:55:31.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4742
01:55:31.490 --> 01:55:31.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4743
01:55:31.781 --> 01:55:32.150
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

4744
01:55:32.150 --> 01:55:32.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4745
01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:33.830
<v Speaker 2>I was out in the backyard.</v>

4746
01:55:33.831 --> 01:55:37.070
<v Speaker 2>So the jump on the roof of the chicken coop and then jump over the top of the</v>

4747
01:55:37.071 --> 01:55:37.760
<v Speaker 2>fence.</v>

4748
01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.560
<v Speaker 2>There's so graceful though.</v>

4749
01:55:39.590 --> 01:55:40.190
<v Speaker 2>They're smart.</v>

4750
01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:41.450
<v Speaker 2>It's all so smart.</v>

4751
01:55:41.451 --> 01:55:41.841
<v Speaker 2>One of my,</v>

4752
01:55:41.841 --> 01:55:43.100
<v Speaker 2>one of my good buddies who,</v>

4753
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:45.930
<v Speaker 1>he sold his company to Orkin,</v>

4754
01:55:45.931 --> 01:55:48.810
<v Speaker 1>so he was an expert at getting rid of deer,</v>

4755
01:55:48.811 --> 01:55:49.890
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of Coyote's,</v>

4756
01:55:49.891 --> 01:55:51.500
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of anything off your property,</v>

4757
01:55:51.530 --> 01:55:53.490
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of raccoons out of your house,</v>

4758
01:55:53.491 --> 01:55:53.911
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

4759
01:55:53.911 --> 01:55:54.121
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4760
01:55:54.121 --> 01:55:54.930
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

4761
01:55:54.930 --> 01:55:57.630
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy that started trapping when he was 10 years old.</v>

4762
01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4763
01:55:58.230 --> 01:56:00.300
<v Speaker 1>And some of my buddies did that and he was one of them,</v>

4764
01:56:00.690 --> 01:56:01.680
<v Speaker 1>but he became the expert,</v>

4765
01:56:01.681 --> 01:56:03.810
<v Speaker 1>sold his company to Oregon for a lot of money.</v>

4766
01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:07.710
<v Speaker 1>But he is the first and foremost guy besides one other guy,</v>

4767
01:56:07.711 --> 01:56:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I think world worldwide that is the expert in trapping coyotes.</v>

4768
01:56:12.211 --> 01:56:13.470
<v Speaker 1>And when he explains it to you,</v>

4769
01:56:13.471 --> 01:56:14.304
<v Speaker 1>you sit there and go,</v>

4770
01:56:14.610 --> 01:56:16.150
<v Speaker 1>how smart are these?</v>

4771
01:56:16.151 --> 01:56:17.880
<v Speaker 1>And if there's anything out of place,</v>

4772
01:56:17.881 --> 01:56:20.220
<v Speaker 1>they never take the same way back to their den ever.</v>

4773
01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:21.840
<v Speaker 1>They always go a different route.</v>

4774
01:56:21.841 --> 01:56:24.700
<v Speaker 1>They're smart about covering their tracks and to trap him.</v>

4775
01:56:24.730 --> 01:56:25.440
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4776
01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:26.880
<v Speaker 1>if you do one thing wrong,</v>

4777
01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:27.690
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

4778
01:56:27.690 --> 01:56:29.400
<v Speaker 1>they recognize it right away and they're gone.</v>

4779
01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:31.860
<v Speaker 1>So he had to go and really study,</v>

4780
01:56:31.861 --> 01:56:34.620
<v Speaker 1>research and disagree years by Dan Flores.</v>

4781
01:56:34.621 --> 01:56:36.030
<v Speaker 1>It's called Coyote America.</v>

4782
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:36.840
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4783
01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:37.673
<v Speaker 1>Dan is a,</v>

4784
01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:38.890
<v Speaker 1>he's a professor at,</v>

4785
01:56:38.891 --> 01:56:41.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it was he from university in New Mexico.</v>

4786
01:56:41.670 --> 01:56:42.810
<v Speaker 1>He's from New Mexico,</v>

4787
01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:44.160
<v Speaker 1>genius guy.</v>

4788
01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:49.220
<v Speaker 1>But he went into great detail about how intelligent these fucking things I about</v>

4789
01:56:49.471 --> 01:56:51.840
<v Speaker 1>how native Americans used to think they were gods.</v>

4790
01:56:52.210 --> 01:56:54.900
<v Speaker 1>They were tricksters and they're basically wolves.</v>

4791
01:56:55.050 --> 01:56:55.950
<v Speaker 1>There are small wolf.</v>

4792
01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:56.281
<v Speaker 1>Miniature,</v>

4793
01:56:56.281 --> 01:56:56.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4794
01:56:56.540 --> 01:56:56.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4795
01:56:56.910 --> 01:56:57.743
<v Speaker 1>They're just a miniature,</v>

4796
01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:58.730
<v Speaker 1>super intelligent.</v>

4797
01:56:58.730 --> 01:56:59.250
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

4798
01:56:59.250 --> 01:57:02.430
<v Speaker 1>my old house that I had that had some timber on it and stuff.</v>

4799
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I had a fox down across the creek on the hillside,</v>

4800
01:57:05.791 --> 01:57:06.361
<v Speaker 1>the five watts,</v>

4801
01:57:06.361 --> 01:57:06.660
<v Speaker 1>a hawk,</v>

4802
01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Fox coming back with squirrels and rabbits every morning at four or five when</v>

4803
01:57:09.661 --> 01:57:10.490
<v Speaker 1>that'd be up to get warm,</v>

4804
01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:11.251
<v Speaker 1>get workouts in,</v>

4805
01:57:11.251 --> 01:57:12.150
<v Speaker 1>they'd be drinking coffee.</v>

4806
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I'd have Turkey vultures on my frigging Turkey.</v>

4807
01:57:15.061 --> 01:57:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Vultures are this big man.</v>

4808
01:57:16.201 --> 01:57:17.034
<v Speaker 1>They're massive.</v>

4809
01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:18.790
<v Speaker 1>And they'd sit on the railing of my,</v>

4810
01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:19.290
<v Speaker 1>my pad,</v>

4811
01:57:19.290 --> 01:57:20.340
<v Speaker 1>my porch outside.</v>

4812
01:57:20.341 --> 01:57:20.551
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4813

<v Speaker 1>They're huge.</v>

4851
01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:07.741
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy of mine,</v>

4852
01:58:07.741 --> 01:58:08.790
<v Speaker 1>my friend John Dudley,</v>

4853
01:58:08.791 --> 01:58:10.830
<v Speaker 1>he bought a farm out in Iowa.</v>

4854
01:58:10.831 --> 01:58:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Just a hunt whitetail.</v>

4879
01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:41.530
<v Speaker 1>They're well fed all the time.</v>

4880
01:58:41.890 --> 01:58:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

4881
01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:43.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4882
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:44.050
<v Speaker 1>did I hit a deer?</v>

4883
01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:44.621
<v Speaker 1>What was it,</v>

4884
01:58:44.621 --> 01:58:46.810
<v Speaker 1>a year and a half ago with my F-150 and all it was,</v>

4885
01:58:46.811 --> 01:58:51.070
<v Speaker 1>was his chest hit the front quarter up front of the quarter panel and scraped</v>

4886
01:58:51.071 --> 01:58:52.930
<v Speaker 1>down at and destroy the whole side of my truck.</v>

4887
01:58:53.110 --> 01:58:53.943
<v Speaker 1>Just destroyed it.</v>

4888
01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:54.670
<v Speaker 1>They're that big.</v>

4889
01:58:54.670 --> 01:58:55.420
<v Speaker 1>They're tanks.</v>

4890
01:58:55.420 --> 01:58:55.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4891
01:58:55.811 --> 01:58:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine hitting a moose.</v>

4892
01:58:57.730 --> 01:59:00.220
<v Speaker 1>My Dad hit a moose almost killing Jesus.</v>

4893
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.770
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

4894
01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:01.090
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4895
01:59:01.090 --> 01:59:01.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4896
01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:06.320
<v Speaker 1>the vehicle caught on fire because the moose crushed into the engine compartment</v>

4897
01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:10.100
<v Speaker 1>and caved in the front of the vehicle and then it all caught on fire.</v>

4898
01:59:10.101 --> 01:59:12.560
<v Speaker 1>And my dad had the to and go out the kick the back of window off to get out</v>

4899
01:59:12.610 --> 01:59:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

4900
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:15.520
<v Speaker 1>And if you hawk it a moose,</v>

4901
01:59:15.521 --> 01:59:16.960
<v Speaker 1>if you stop and then Hawk it a moose,</v>

4902
01:59:16.961 --> 01:59:17.794
<v Speaker 1>I'll kick your ass.</v>

4903
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:19.510
<v Speaker 1>They'll run in and smash your car.</v>

4904
01:59:19.810 --> 01:59:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4905
01:59:20.140 --> 01:59:22.000
<v Speaker 1>So you've just seen a moose.</v>

4906
01:59:22.450 --> 01:59:23.560
<v Speaker 1>I went on a fishing trip,</v>

4907
01:59:23.590 --> 01:59:26.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the many fishing trips I went on in Canada with a friend of mine,</v>

4908
01:59:26.081 --> 01:59:26.914
<v Speaker 1>Mark Lewis,</v>

4909
01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:29.530
<v Speaker 1>and we were in a v bottom boat.</v>

4910
01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:32.320
<v Speaker 1>There was three of us and we were going the English river system,</v>

4911
01:59:32.321 --> 01:59:35.350
<v Speaker 1>if you ever want to go fishing in the summer for bad ass fish,</v>

4912
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:36.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean you'll,</v>

4913
01:59:36.281 --> 01:59:37.840
<v Speaker 1>you'll wear out catching fish up there.</v>

4914
01:59:37.930 --> 01:59:42.160
<v Speaker 1>It's north of lake of the woods and we were going across the lake and the</v>

4915
01:59:42.161 --> 01:59:45.460
<v Speaker 1>English river system is massive and it's endless amounts of islands.</v>

4916
01:59:45.461 --> 01:59:47.020
<v Speaker 1>You can get lost really easy up there.</v>

4917
01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:51.010
<v Speaker 1>But we were cutting across the lake and we got into this bay and there was a</v>

4918
01:59:51.011 --> 01:59:52.390
<v Speaker 1>moose swimming across the band,</v>

4919
01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:54.250
<v Speaker 1>you know the huge rack on it and everything else.</v>

4920
01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:55.750
<v Speaker 1>And my buddy mark goes,</v>

4921
01:59:55.960 --> 01:59:56.793
<v Speaker 1>pull up next to it.</v>

4922
01:59:58.090 --> 01:59:58.361
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4923
01:59:58.361 --> 01:59:58.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4924
01:59:58.490 --> 01:59:59.530
<v Speaker 1>just pull up right to its ass.</v>

4925
01:59:59.531 --> 02:00:03.550
<v Speaker 1>And so I pulled up kind of just on its ass and he jumps out of the boat on its</v>

4926
02:00:03.551 --> 02:00:04.300
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

4927
02:00:04.300 --> 02:00:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh no he did.</v>

4928
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:07.623
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

4929
02:00:08.010 --> 02:00:10.540
<v Speaker 1>so he's riding on the back of the Moose and the Moose was doing this,</v>

4930
02:00:10.541 --> 02:00:13.480
<v Speaker 1>trying to get to him and finally he jumps off,</v>

4931
02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>climbs back in the boat.</v>

4932
02:00:14.381 --> 02:00:17.770
<v Speaker 1>We turned away and write down the moose hit shallow ground and came up right</v>

4933
02:00:17.771 --> 02:00:18.820
<v Speaker 1>after he would have been dead.</v>

4934
02:00:18.970 --> 02:00:19.803
<v Speaker 1>He would have been dead.</v>

4935
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Big fucking animal.</v>

4936
02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:23.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4937
02:00:23.231 --> 02:00:27.250
<v Speaker 2>They're one of the rare deer species that almost regularly charges people.</v>

4938
02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4939
02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:28.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4940
02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:28.901
<v Speaker 2>They fuck people up.</v>

4941
02:00:28.901 --> 02:00:30.340
<v Speaker 2>All the things run into Duluth,</v>

4942
02:00:30.341 --> 02:00:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Minnesota in downtown and smash everybody.</v>

4943
02:00:32.410 --> 02:00:32.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4944
02:00:32.621 --> 02:00:33.710
<v Speaker 2>They just stomped people in,</v>

4945
02:00:33.711 --> 02:00:35.410
<v Speaker 2>in Alaska too.</v>

4946
02:00:35.411 --> 02:00:40.120
<v Speaker 2>And it's usually the problem is if you find them a female that's with our babies</v>

4947
02:00:40.121 --> 02:00:40.570
<v Speaker 2>are done,</v>

4948
02:00:40.570 --> 02:00:41.440
<v Speaker 2>that's when you're in real,</v>

4949
02:00:41.441 --> 02:00:42.011
<v Speaker 2>real trouble.</v>

4950
02:00:42.011 --> 02:00:42.141
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4951
02:00:42.141 --> 02:00:42.370
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4952
02:00:42.370 --> 02:00:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4953
02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:43.780
<v Speaker 2>So do you hunt much?</v>

4954
02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:44.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4955
02:00:44.081 --> 02:00:44.500
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>

4956
02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4957

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4982
02:01:16.991 --> 02:01:18.130
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty bad back there.</v>

4983
02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4984

<v Speaker 2>45 yard indoor range.</v>

4985

<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>

4986
02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:21.600
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

4987
02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:22.433
<v Speaker 2>Keep practice.</v>

4988
02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:24.760
<v Speaker 1>The doctor that I told you about,</v>

4989
02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Tyson Cobb,</v>

4990
02:01:25.850 --> 02:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>the orthopedic surgeon that fixed him,</v>

4991
02:01:27.121 --> 02:01:27.954
<v Speaker 1>his arm,</v>

4992
02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>he was a bow hunter who went and got crocodile in Africa,</v>

4993
02:01:31.450 --> 02:01:31.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4994
02:01:31.751 --> 02:01:33.140
<v Speaker 1>big old giant games,</v>

4995
02:01:33.141 --> 02:01:33.974
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

4996
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

4997
02:01:36.130 --> 02:01:36.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4998
02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:38.380
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that he haunted was,</v>

4999
02:01:38.410 --> 02:01:39.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5000
02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5001
02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>killing a grizzly</v>

5002
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:41.750
<v Speaker 2>with a bow is some scary stuff.</v>

5003
02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:42.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5004
02:01:42.021 --> 02:01:43.880
<v Speaker 2>That's a real risky proposition.</v>

5005
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:44.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5006
02:01:44.061 --> 02:01:44.660
<v Speaker 2>But he did,</v>

5007
02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:45.500
<v Speaker 2>he did stuff like that.</v>

5008
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5009
02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:49.130
<v Speaker 2>My friend Dudley that I was telling you about that lives in Iowa,</v>

5010
02:01:49.131 --> 02:01:50.270
<v Speaker 2>he does that too.</v>

5011
02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:51.620
<v Speaker 2>He goes all over the world and,</v>

5012
02:01:51.710 --> 02:01:53.120
<v Speaker 2>and hunts you miss.</v>

5013
02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:53.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5014
02:01:53.841 --> 02:01:54.441
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

5015
02:01:54.441 --> 02:01:55.310
<v Speaker 2>very risky.</v>

5016
02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Very risky.</v>

5017
02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5018
02:01:56.690 --> 02:01:57.800
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

5019
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:59.143
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5020
02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:02.060
<v Speaker 2>the thing about the grizzly hunting is like,</v>

5021
02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:04.220
<v Speaker 2>people don't like it.</v>

5022
02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Like it's gotten to the point where in BC they've outlawed it,</v>

5023
02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:07.910
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5024
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:08.271
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

5025
02:02:08.271 --> 02:02:08.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5026
02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:10.040
<v Speaker 2>they really shouldn't have.</v>

5027
02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:13.100
<v Speaker 2>And the reason being is that you've got to control the populations because</v>

5028
02:02:13.101 --> 02:02:15.860
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing that eats them like except them.</v>

5029
02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:17.360
<v Speaker 2>They're all cannibals.</v>

5030
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:18.051
<v Speaker 2>All Grizzlies,</v>

5031
02:02:18.051 --> 02:02:18.291
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

5032
02:02:18.291 --> 02:02:19.760
<v Speaker 2>even black bears are all cannibals.</v>

5033
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Sticky.</v>

5034
02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:20.930
<v Speaker 2>The cubs,</v>

5035
02:02:20.930 --> 02:02:21.950
<v Speaker 2>the cubs all the time.</v>

5036
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:23.120
<v Speaker 2>And if one of them dies,</v>

5037
02:02:23.121 --> 02:02:23.870
<v Speaker 2>like if you,</v>

5038
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:27.110
<v Speaker 2>I've been black bear hunting before and if you shoot a black bear and like maybe</v>

5039
02:02:27.111 --> 02:02:30.000
<v Speaker 2>you shoot it like right before dark and it runs off into the Bush camp,</v>

5040
02:02:30.190 --> 02:02:31.100
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to go after it.</v>

5041
02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:32.390
<v Speaker 2>You come back in the morning,</v>

5042
02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:33.253
<v Speaker 2>bears are eating it.</v>

5043
02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5044
02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:34.220
<v Speaker 2>they eat,</v>

5045
02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:35.120
<v Speaker 2>they eat their own.</v>

5046
02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I've just been a guy that,</v>

5047
02:02:36.050 --> 02:02:36.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5048
02:02:36.750 --> 02:02:38.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't have time to hunt.</v>

5049
02:02:38.091 --> 02:02:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5050
02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:39.740
<v Speaker 2>I've gone deer hunting a couple times.</v>

5051
02:02:39.741 --> 02:02:40.360
<v Speaker 2>I just never,</v>

5052
02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:40.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5053
02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm more of a fish.</v>

5054
02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I love to fish.</v>

5055
02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:42.800
<v Speaker 2>I do too.</v>

5056
02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:43.131
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5057
02:02:43.131 --> 02:02:44.000
<v Speaker 2>So that's my fishing.</v>

5058
02:02:44.001 --> 02:02:44.720
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>

5059
02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I'll fish for,</v>

5060
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5061
02:02:46.581 --> 02:02:48.500
<v Speaker 2>I've fished for shark off a beach before.</v>

5062
02:02:48.830 --> 02:02:50.290
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that people get mad at it.</v>

5063
02:02:50.291 --> 02:02:51.590
<v Speaker 2>They get mad if eat sharks now.</v>

5064
02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Well we let them go.</v>

5065
02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:53.241
<v Speaker 2>We let them go.</v>

5066
02:02:53.241 --> 02:02:53.511
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5067
02:02:53.511 --> 02:02:53.930
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

5068
02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:54.501
<v Speaker 2>not a big deal.</v>

5069
02:02:54.501 --> 02:02:56.570
<v Speaker 2>But I watched a guy from black barks,</v>

5070
02:02:56.750 --> 02:02:57.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5071
02:02:57.050 --> 02:02:58.130
<v Speaker 2>tackle company.</v>

5072
02:02:58.430 --> 02:03:00.020
<v Speaker 2>They taught me how to do it off the beach.</v>

5073
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:02.660
<v Speaker 2>These guys are catching 14 foot hammerheads off the beach.</v>

5074
02:03:02.661 --> 02:03:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

5075
02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Do you know one of the best places to hunt to fish for sharks rather is off of</v>

5076
02:03:06.621 --> 02:03:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Catalina or right out,</v>

5077
02:03:08.150 --> 02:03:08.990
<v Speaker 2>right out of your wife?</v>

5078
02:03:09.170 --> 02:03:09.501
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5079
02:03:09.501 --> 02:03:10.520
<v Speaker 2>for a Maaco.</v>

5080
02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5081
02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:12.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the best Maaco Shark,</v>

5082
02:03:12.770 --> 02:03:13.603
<v Speaker 2>which are massive.</v>

5083
02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:14.361
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

5084
02:03:14.361 --> 02:03:14.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5085
02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5086
02:03:15.470 --> 02:03:15.741
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5087
02:03:15.741 --> 02:03:17.000
<v Speaker 2>but they taught me how to do that.</v>

5088
02:03:17.001 --> 02:03:18.140
<v Speaker 2>I love fishing for Barracuda,</v>

5089
02:03:18.141 --> 02:03:19.250
<v Speaker 2>just cause they're so aggressive.</v>

5090
02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:20.270
<v Speaker 2>It's a fun fish.</v>

5091
02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

5092
02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:22.240
<v Speaker 2>They're scarier than hell.</v>

5093
02:03:22.241 --> 02:03:23.690
<v Speaker 2>As fast as they hit a lure.</v>

5094
02:03:23.691 --> 02:03:24.250
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

5095
02:03:24.250 --> 02:03:25.130
<v Speaker 2>But crazy looking at,</v>

5096
02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:27.490
<v Speaker 2>and I love Musky Pike fishing bass fishing.</v>

5097
02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Say they look like a pike on steroids.</v>

5098
02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:30.231
<v Speaker 2>That's what they are.</v>

5099
02:03:30.231 --> 02:03:31.820
<v Speaker 2>They're the sea water fish.</v>

5100
02:03:32.150 --> 02:03:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

5101
02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Muskies are awesome.</v>

5102
02:03:33.441 --> 02:03:36.950
<v Speaker 2>So I went musky fishing at the [inaudible] Indian reservation.</v>

5103
02:03:37.550 --> 02:03:40.460
<v Speaker 2>It's the Chippewa flowage where the biggest muskie in the world was ever caught.</v>

5104
02:03:40.461 --> 02:03:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5105
02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

5106
02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:44.300
<v Speaker 2>How much is that a 67 pounds Saturday?</v>

5107
02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:44.780
<v Speaker 2>One thing,</v>

5108
02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:45.201
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

5109
02:03:45.201 --> 02:03:45.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

5110
02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:46.131
<v Speaker 2>it's huge.</v>

5111
02:03:46.131 --> 02:03:46.610
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>

5112
02:03:46.610 --> 02:03:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Coyote size.</v>

5113
02:03:47.690 --> 02:03:51.500
<v Speaker 2>But they've found jaws and teeth of muskies that are twice that size,</v>

5114
02:03:51.650 --> 02:03:51.950
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5115
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Just washed up on shore type stuff.</v>

5116
02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:55.250
<v Speaker 2>So there's huge muskie still.</v>

5117
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:58.070
<v Speaker 2>But the guy that took me fishing,</v>

5118
02:03:58.080 --> 02:03:58.821
<v Speaker 2>he took a job.</v>

5119
02:03:58.821 --> 02:04:01.880
<v Speaker 2>He used to work in Vegas for the casino down in Vegas.</v>

5120
02:04:01.881 --> 02:04:02.810
<v Speaker 2>I forget which one.</v>

5121
02:04:03.170 --> 02:04:05.330
<v Speaker 2>And he left that and went back to Wisconsin,</v>

5122
02:04:05.331 --> 02:04:07.970
<v Speaker 2>northern Wisconsin because he wanted to muskie fish.</v>

5123
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.301
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5124
02:04:08.301 --> 02:04:11.420
<v Speaker 2>So he took a job with the Lakota Indian reservations just so he could musky</v>

5125
02:04:11.421 --> 02:04:13.160
<v Speaker 2>fishing and he was the vice president.</v>

5126
02:04:13.190 --> 02:04:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

5127
02:04:15.110 --> 02:04:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of that.</v>

5128
02:04:16.131 --> 02:04:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Fucking their tear.</v>

5129
02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:17.660
<v Speaker 2>They're terrifying.</v>

5130
02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:18.001
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5131
02:04:18.001 --> 02:04:21.110
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a person that's like a person the size to fish.</v>

5132
02:04:21.590 --> 02:04:22.100
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

5133
02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:23.660
<v Speaker 2>that's less than 60 pounds.</v>

5134
02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:24.440
<v Speaker 2>But those will,</v>

5135
02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:25.460
<v Speaker 2>those will attack you.</v>

5136
02:04:25.610 --> 02:04:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

5137
02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:27.141
<v Speaker 2>They'll attack you there.</v>

5138
02:04:27.141 --> 02:04:30.860
<v Speaker 2>That I knew a dude who invented a lure.</v>

5139
02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:32.493
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5140
02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:33.471

5143
02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

5144
02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:38.430
<v Speaker 2>someone invented a lore that was a duck.</v>

5147
02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:44.420
<v Speaker 1>You Hook them through the tail and throw them out on top of the lake and let</v>

5148
02:04:44.421 --> 02:04:45.710
<v Speaker 1>them swim around in a Musky would hit him.</v>

02:04:53.001 --> 02:04:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Then as you read it in the paddles,</v>

5156
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:59.190
<v Speaker 3>the feet would move and the Musky would think it's a real duck.</v>

5157
02:04:59.191 --> 02:04:59.850
<v Speaker 3>And they jack.</v>

02:05:09.361 --> 02:05:10.140
<v Speaker 3>so nice.</v>

5168
02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:10.411
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

5169
02:05:10.411 --> 02:05:13.260
<v Speaker 3>this is my fishing days or a long fucking time ago.</v>

5170
02:05:13.290 --> 02:05:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5171
02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:16.530
<v Speaker 3>This is like when I was a very early teenager,</v>

5172
02:05:16.531 --> 02:05:18.720
<v Speaker 3>like 1314 I was so connected to fishing.</v>

5173
02:05:18.721 --> 02:05:19.554
<v Speaker 3>I fish constantly.</v>

5174
02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:20.393
<v Speaker 3>I still fish.</v>

5175
02:05:20.610 --> 02:05:21.443
<v Speaker 3>I still love it,</v>

5176
02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:22.141
<v Speaker 3>but a,</v>

5177
02:05:22.141 --> 02:05:24.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm out of the loop in turns of like that.</v>

5178
02:05:24.541 --> 02:05:25.560
<v Speaker 3>This is a regular thing.</v>

5179
02:05:25.561 --> 02:05:27.420
<v Speaker 3>So this is a duck also.</v>

5180
02:05:27.421 --> 02:05:28.021
<v Speaker 3>The duck is like,</v>

5181
02:05:28.021 --> 02:05:28.980
<v Speaker 3>he's running away</v>

5182
02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:30.691
<v Speaker 1>at a Musky,</v>

5183
02:05:30.691 --> 02:05:32.320
<v Speaker 1>comes in Jackson and make him look panicked,</v>

5184
02:05:32.330 --> 02:05:32.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5185
02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:33.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5186
02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:34.583
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

5187
02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:39.240
<v Speaker 1>he was the vice president of the Musky World Association and he took me fishing</v>

5188
02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:40.913
<v Speaker 1>and he goes there,</v>

5189
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:43.090
<v Speaker 1>we have tons of muskies that we've radio tag.</v>

5190
02:05:43.110 --> 02:05:43.471
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

5191
02:05:43.471 --> 02:05:44.460
<v Speaker 1>but we're not going to use that.</v>

5192
02:05:44.461 --> 02:05:45.061
<v Speaker 1>That's cheating.</v>

5193
02:05:45.061 --> 02:05:45.871
<v Speaker 1>I know their patterns.</v>

5194
02:05:45.871 --> 02:05:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

5195
02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:47.263
<v Speaker 1>tag a Musky.</v>

5196
02:05:47.370 --> 02:05:50.530
<v Speaker 1>They just put punched the thing by the Dorsal fan and it's got the little,</v>

5197
02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:53.060
<v Speaker 1>gives out a transmitter and you know,</v>

5198
02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:55.140
<v Speaker 1>you can find out their patterns or whatever.</v>

5199
02:05:55.860 --> 02:05:56.371
<v Speaker 1>But he goes,</v>

5200
02:05:56.371 --> 02:05:58.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll take your Musky fishing tomorrow if you want to go.</v>

5201
02:05:58.201 --> 02:05:58.411
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

5202
02:05:58.411 --> 02:05:58.591
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5203
02:05:58.591 --> 02:05:58.951
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

5204
02:05:58.951 --> 02:06:01.860
<v Speaker 1>So we go to the bait store and he gets chubs this big.</v>

5205
02:06:02.070 --> 02:06:02.820
<v Speaker 1>That's the bait.</v>

5206
02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>So you're holding your hand out about a foot and a half there,</v>

5207
02:06:06.270 --> 02:06:08.040
<v Speaker 1>at least 1214 inch fish,</v>

5208
02:06:08.070 --> 02:06:08.281
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5209
02:06:08.281 --> 02:06:09.114
<v Speaker 1>That's the bait.</v>

5210
02:06:09.150 --> 02:06:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5211
02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:12.090
<v Speaker 1>And he'd hook 'em through by the Dorsal Fan.</v>

5212
02:06:12.450 --> 02:06:13.410
<v Speaker 1>We'd go out in the boat,</v>

5213
02:06:13.590 --> 02:06:16.110
<v Speaker 1>drop the Chub straight down,</v>

5214
02:06:16.140 --> 02:06:19.230
<v Speaker 1>then we'd go back to the island and he had a rod holder,</v>

5215
02:06:19.231 --> 02:06:20.160
<v Speaker 1>put the pole in there,</v>

5216
02:06:20.161 --> 02:06:20.761
<v Speaker 1>set the drag,</v>

5217
02:06:20.761 --> 02:06:21.271
<v Speaker 1>real light,</v>

5218
02:06:21.271 --> 02:06:24.900
<v Speaker 1>put a Bob at the top of the line so you could see the bobber move if something</v>

5219
02:06:24.901 --> 02:06:25.734
<v Speaker 1>was taken off with it.</v>

5220
02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And we did that four separate times with four lines.</v>

5221
02:06:28.410 --> 02:06:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And then we sat in the boat and ate sandwiches and just talked and then all of a</v>

5222
02:06:32.791 --> 02:06:34.560
<v Speaker 1>sudden the bobber takes off and he goes,</v>

5223
02:06:34.561 --> 02:06:34.801
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

5224
02:06:34.801 --> 02:06:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pull up you run and grab the pole.</v>

5225
02:06:36.241 --> 02:06:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Jumped back in the boat.</v>

5226
02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:38.400
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

5227
02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:39.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to maneuver you and keep you.</v>

5228
02:06:39.781 --> 02:06:43.080
<v Speaker 1>You have to stay over the top of the fish and with Musky trolling motor scare</v>

5229
02:06:43.081 --> 02:06:43.740
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

5230
02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:46.530
<v Speaker 1>But a regular boat motor island does not for some reason.</v>

5231
02:06:46.590 --> 02:06:49.230
<v Speaker 1>So I'm learning a ton of stuff from this guy and he goes,</v>

5232
02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:50.670
<v Speaker 1>we have to for 25 minutes.</v>

5233
02:06:50.670 --> 02:06:54.420
<v Speaker 1>You have to let him turn that fish head first and then swallow.</v>

5234
02:06:54.510 --> 02:06:56.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the rule about 25 minutes.</v>

5235
02:06:56.041 --> 02:06:56.491
<v Speaker 1>It takes them,</v>

5236
02:06:56.491 --> 02:06:57.181
<v Speaker 1>they take their time,</v>

5237
02:06:57.181 --> 02:06:58.020
<v Speaker 1>they wait till it's dead,</v>

5238
02:06:58.021 --> 02:07:01.800
<v Speaker 1>they crush it with their jaws and they slowly flip it and then they swallow it</v>

5239
02:07:01.890 --> 02:07:02.281
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

5240
02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:04.620
<v Speaker 1>but if it starts to run anytime before that,</v>

5241
02:07:04.621 --> 02:07:05.760
<v Speaker 1>you have to try and set the hook.</v>

5242
02:07:05.790 --> 02:07:06.623
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way it is.</v>

5243
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.831
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5244
02:07:07.831 --> 02:07:09.300
<v Speaker 1>and this is my first time Musky fishing.</v>

5245
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:10.800
<v Speaker 1>When they start chewing on them,</v>

5246
02:07:10.801 --> 02:07:11.634
<v Speaker 1>you just wait.</v>

5247
02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5248
02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:12.481
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5249
02:07:12.481 --> 02:07:13.231
<v Speaker 1>You stay over him.</v>

5250
02:07:13.231 --> 02:07:13.710
<v Speaker 1>But so the,</v>

5251
02:07:13.710 --> 02:07:15.870
<v Speaker 1>the Musky will be swimming a size that fucker.</v>

5252
02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5253
02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:18.030
<v Speaker 1>So there'll be swimming along.</v>

5254
02:07:18.031 --> 02:07:19.230
<v Speaker 1>So somebody caught that,</v>

5255
02:07:19.620 --> 02:07:20.760
<v Speaker 1>caught that bass,</v>

5256
02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:20.940
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5257
02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:22.750
<v Speaker 3>Then the [inaudible] got a hold of that.</v>

5258
02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:23.860
<v Speaker 3>They just have the Musky.</v>

5259
02:07:23.861 --> 02:07:24.694
<v Speaker 3>They just have the bat.</v>

5260
02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:24.951
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5261
02:07:24.951 --> 02:07:26.510
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to let them turn them and then set the hook.</v>

5262
02:07:26.511 --> 02:07:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll catch the Musky.</v>

5263
02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5264
02:07:28.100 --> 02:07:29.150
<v Speaker 1>But so that's what we did.</v>

5265
02:07:29.151 --> 02:07:30.620
<v Speaker 1>And at about 17 minutes it took off,</v>

5266
02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:31.580
<v Speaker 1>started to run.</v>

5267
02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I set the hook and I caught a 52 inch musky first.</v>

5268
02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

5269
02:07:35.930 --> 02:07:36.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5270
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

5271
02:07:37.301 --> 02:07:38.800
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I set the hook in a log.</v>

5272
02:07:38.890 --> 02:07:40.820
<v Speaker 2>That is a big fucking thing.</v>

5273
02:07:40.821 --> 02:07:41.670
<v Speaker 2>And I really cool stuff.</v>

5274
02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:43.210
<v Speaker 2>The two inch Musky man.</v>

5275
02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:43.811
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5276
02:07:43.811 --> 02:07:45.070
<v Speaker 2>they're a northern pike.</v>

5277
02:07:45.071 --> 02:07:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Fishing is very fun.</v>

5278
02:07:45.981 --> 02:07:47.050
<v Speaker 2>I've done that in Alberta.</v>

5279
02:07:47.170 --> 02:07:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Some of my favorite times.</v>

5280
02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:49.960
<v Speaker 2>They hit hard.</v>

5281
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5282
02:07:50.141 --> 02:07:52.360
<v Speaker 2>And so the English river system where we used to go,</v>

5283
02:07:52.810 --> 02:07:53.643
<v Speaker 2>if you catch up,</v>

5284
02:07:54.050 --> 02:07:55.420
<v Speaker 2>you know a pike this long,</v>

5285
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:57.670
<v Speaker 2>you leave it on the hook cause a big ones common.</v>

5286
02:07:57.850 --> 02:07:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5287
02:07:58.410 --> 02:07:59.740
<v Speaker 2>And then the first time it happened to me,</v>

5288
02:08:00.010 --> 02:08:01.120
<v Speaker 2>scared the living shit out of it.</v>

5289
02:08:01.300 --> 02:08:05.500
<v Speaker 2>So when you catch a pike that's two feet long and you just leave it on the hook,</v>

5290
02:08:05.530 --> 02:08:07.090
<v Speaker 2>let it swim around up there anyway.</v>

5291
02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:09.030
<v Speaker 2>And you're just hoping that no you're not.</v>

5292
02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:10.173
<v Speaker 2>It's common.</v>

5293
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.960
<v Speaker 2>It's common.</v>

5294
02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:12.100
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5295
02:08:12.610 --> 02:08:13.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5296
02:08:13.150 --> 02:08:13.840
<v Speaker 2>So a big one.</v>

5297
02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:14.673
<v Speaker 2>This one here.</v>

5298
02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5299
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:16.343
<v Speaker 2>Watch</v>

5300
02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:18.670
<v Speaker 2>fucking cannibals.</v>

5301
02:08:19.450 --> 02:08:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Cannibals in the Goldwater world number babe.</v>

5302

5303

5304
02:08:29.741 --> 02:08:30.580
<v Speaker 2>that's underneath it.</v>

5305
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:32.590
<v Speaker 2>There's such a crazy animal too,</v>

5306
02:08:32.770 --> 02:08:36.820
<v Speaker 2>like pike seen prehistoric and they are cannibals without a doubt.</v>

5307
02:08:36.850 --> 02:08:37.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5308
02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:38.313
<v Speaker 2>Babe Winkelman.</v>

5309
02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:40.600
<v Speaker 2>I watched the video while I was in Canada fishing.</v>

5310
02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:44.890
<v Speaker 2>We were at the lodge and Babe Winkelman is asking this guy who's a an Indian</v>

5311
02:08:44.891 --> 02:08:45.370
<v Speaker 2>guide.</v>

5312
02:08:45.370 --> 02:08:46.180
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

5313
02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:47.050
<v Speaker 2>so what do pike?</v>

5314
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:48.310
<v Speaker 2>And the guide goes,</v>

5315
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:50.440
<v Speaker 2>pike the Pike.</v>

5316
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.890
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

5317
02:08:50.890 --> 02:08:51.101
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5318
02:08:51.101 --> 02:08:51.850
<v Speaker 2>what to Pikey?</v>

5319
02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:52.121
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

5320
02:08:52.121 --> 02:08:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Pike like they breed.</v>

5321
02:08:53.891 --> 02:08:54.724
<v Speaker 2>So they have food.</v>

5322
02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:56.110
<v Speaker 2>That's what they eat.</v>

5323
02:08:57.440 --> 02:08:58.900
<v Speaker 2>It's just they're just aggressive.</v>

5324
02:08:58.901 --> 02:08:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Mean Fish.</v>

5325
02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:00.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5326
02:09:00.311 --> 02:09:03.760
<v Speaker 2>And they live in that dog eat dog cold water environment where there's three</v>

5327
02:09:03.761 --> 02:09:05.440
<v Speaker 2>feet of ice above them half the time.</v>

5328
02:09:05.470 --> 02:09:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

5329
02:09:05.890 --> 02:09:06.101
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5330
02:09:06.101 --> 02:09:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5331
02:09:06.490 --> 02:09:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Well all those animals up there like,</v>

5332
02:09:08.350 --> 02:09:08.651
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

5333
02:09:08.651 --> 02:09:09.670
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about bears.</v>

5334
02:09:09.670 --> 02:09:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Have bears being cannibals and hike,</v>

5335
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:13.630
<v Speaker 2>being cannibals and the fucking deer,</v>

5336
02:09:13.631 --> 02:09:14.850
<v Speaker 2>350 pounds.</v>

5337
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:16.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just a tough hardcore world.</v>

5338
02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5339
02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:19.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean when it gets that God damn cold,</v>

5340
02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:21.160
<v Speaker 2>it's a tough world.</v>

5341
02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Then you go to a whole nother level and go to places like Africa and Australia</v>

5342
02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:25.540
<v Speaker 2>and it's hot.</v>

5343
02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:27.220
<v Speaker 2>It's another world too.</v>

5344
02:09:27.330 --> 02:09:29.140
<v Speaker 2>Everything's deadly in Australia.</v>

5345
02:09:29.141 --> 02:09:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even want to live there.</v>

5346
02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:30.790
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

5347
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Adam Green Tree.</v>

5348
02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Listen to Pat Miletich,</v>

5349
02:09:33.010 --> 02:09:36.560
<v Speaker 2>my friend Adam who shot that a water buffalo head in Australia,</v>

5350
02:09:36.670 --> 02:09:38.800
<v Speaker 2>keeps trying to get me to go down there and hunt with me with him.</v>

5351
02:09:38.801 --> 02:09:39.310
<v Speaker 2>And he's,</v>

5352
02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:42.340
<v Speaker 2>every time he sends me pictures of spiders kill you,</v>

5353
02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:44.080
<v Speaker 2>a lizard that can kill your own snakes.</v>

5354
02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5355
02:09:45.070 --> 02:09:45.491
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

5356
02:09:45.491 --> 02:09:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Everything kills centipedes and they have these gigantic 2000 pound buffaloes</v>

5357
02:09:50.291 --> 02:09:53.980
<v Speaker 2>that are super hyper aggressive and they're roaming around smash you.</v>

5358
02:09:54.130 --> 02:09:54.371
<v Speaker 2>They will,</v>

5359
02:09:54.371 --> 02:09:55.330
<v Speaker 2>they have to kill them though.</v>

5360
02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:56.051
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing.</v>

5361
02:09:56.051 --> 02:09:57.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like the grizzly bear thing.</v>

5362
02:09:57.311 --> 02:09:58.510
<v Speaker 2>They don't have predators,</v>

5363
02:09:59.090 --> 02:09:59.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5364
02:09:59.530 --> 02:09:59.831
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

5365
02:09:59.831 --> 02:10:01.150
<v Speaker 2>in Alaska,</v>

5366
02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:02.140
<v Speaker 2>but they're herbivores.</v>

5367
02:10:02.141 --> 02:10:04.330
<v Speaker 2>So they're kind of meant to be handed in my mind.</v>

5368
02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:05.390
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

5369
02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:05.950
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

5370
02:10:05.950 --> 02:10:07.510
<v Speaker 2>But there's nothing to hunt them out there.</v>

5371
02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5372
02:10:07.730 --> 02:10:10.900
<v Speaker 2>The problem with Australia is that these are invasive species.</v>

5373
02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I got pretty much everything over there.</v>

5374
02:10:12.581 --> 02:10:15.160
<v Speaker 2>So the ranchers brought them there or something for someone brought them there a</v>

5375
02:10:15.161 --> 02:10:16.270
<v Speaker 2>long time ago.</v>

5376
02:10:16.330 --> 02:10:19.180
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand's the craziest place because New Zealand is essentially,</v>

5377
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5378
02:10:19.690 --> 02:10:19.990
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

5379
02:10:19.990 --> 02:10:22.880
<v Speaker 2>they set it up as a wild game park for rich a year,</v>

5380
02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Europeans long time ago.</v>

5381
02:10:25.210 --> 02:10:29.260
<v Speaker 2>And so now they have these enormous stags and all these huge animals that live</v>

5382
02:10:29.261 --> 02:10:29.650
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

5383
02:10:29.650 --> 02:10:31.420
<v Speaker 2>but no predators.</v>

5384
02:10:31.630 --> 02:10:33.500
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes they have to thin the herd,</v>

5385
02:10:33.501 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 2>they have to fly</v>

5386
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.930
<v Speaker 2>over with helicopters and gun him down.</v>

5387
02:10:36.170 --> 02:10:36.291
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5388
02:10:36.291 --> 02:10:37.124
<v Speaker 2>they hunt.</v>

5389
02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:37.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5390
02:10:37.670 --> 02:10:38.570
<v Speaker 2>we're allowed,</v>

5391
02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:40.190
<v Speaker 2>they made a rule in Bettendorf,</v>

5392
02:10:40.191 --> 02:10:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Iowa within city limits.</v>

5393
02:10:41.601 --> 02:10:43.460
<v Speaker 2>You can hunt deer with a bow.</v>

5394
02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5395
02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Within city limits because there's just so many of them.</v>

5396
02:10:46.070 --> 02:10:47.480
<v Speaker 2>You'll see a herd of 50 of them.</v>

5397
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:48.950
<v Speaker 2>They do that in Pennsylvania too.</v>

5398
02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5399
02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:49.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5400
02:10:49.581 --> 02:10:52.610
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of places where they just get so overrun that they have what they</v>

5401
02:10:52.611 --> 02:10:53.540
<v Speaker 2>call urban hunting.</v>

5402
02:10:53.570 --> 02:10:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5403
02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:54.651
<v Speaker 2>But people set up,</v>

5404
02:10:54.651 --> 02:10:56.660
<v Speaker 2>tree stands in their backyard and you know,</v>

5405
02:10:56.680 --> 02:10:56.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5406
02:10:56.930 --> 02:10:57.950
<v Speaker 2>as far as the fishing goes,</v>

5407
02:10:57.951 --> 02:10:58.784
<v Speaker 2>you should go noodling,</v>

5408
02:10:59.510 --> 02:11:00.650
<v Speaker 2>noodling for catfish.</v>

5409
02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:03.080
<v Speaker 2>You got to bite your hand talk that,</v>

5410
02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:06.830
<v Speaker 2>that seems so stupid because occasionally you fuck up and get a snapping turtle.</v>

5411
02:11:06.831 --> 02:11:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5412
02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:07.873
<v Speaker 2>Or beaver.</v>

5413
02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:10.413
<v Speaker 2>Beaver.</v>

5414
02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:13.190
<v Speaker 2>And that's a beaver that can shoot down a tree.</v>

5415
02:11:13.191 --> 02:11:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Magic what it do to your wrists.</v>

5416
02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:15.113
<v Speaker 2>It would hurt.</v>

5417
02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

5418
02:11:16.010 --> 02:11:17.270
<v Speaker 2>I did at one time and that was,</v>

5419
02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:18.980
<v Speaker 2>it went noodling one time.</v>

5420
02:11:18.990 --> 02:11:19.820
<v Speaker 2>I actually got lucky.</v>

5421
02:11:19.820 --> 02:11:20.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5422
02:11:20.031 --> 02:11:20.261
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

5423
02:11:20.261 --> 02:11:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5424
02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:21.710
<v Speaker 2>It was like 14 pounder,</v>

5425
02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:23.150
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5426
02:11:23.150 --> 02:11:24.620
<v Speaker 2>But when they snapped on your arm,</v>

5427
02:11:24.621 --> 02:11:25.520
<v Speaker 2>it scares the shit out of you.</v>

5428
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:25.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5429
02:11:25.701 --> 02:11:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure right now,</v>

5430
02:11:26.691 --> 02:11:29.900
<v Speaker 2>what is the idea is that the catfish thinks you're intruding or they think it's</v>

5431
02:11:29.901 --> 02:11:30.410
<v Speaker 2>a fish.</v>

5432
02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:31.820
<v Speaker 2>All they do think it's our hands,</v>

5433
02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:32.110
<v Speaker 2>a fish,</v>

5434
02:11:32.110 --> 02:11:33.600
<v Speaker 2>and they get to see your hand is bait.</v>

5435
02:11:33.670 --> 02:11:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5436
02:11:34.070 --> 02:11:34.903
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

5437
02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I like fishing poles.</v>

5438
02:11:36.771 --> 02:11:38.930
<v Speaker 2>I like to be in a boat or on the shore.</v>

5439
02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:39.411
<v Speaker 2>I like all the,</v>

5440
02:11:39.411 --> 02:11:41.570
<v Speaker 2>all the sophisticated intelligent things.</v>

5441
02:11:41.571 --> 02:11:41.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5442
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:42.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5443
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:44.750
<v Speaker 2>So I was going to ask you,</v>

5444
02:11:44.751 --> 02:11:45.110
<v Speaker 2>how's it,</v>

5445
02:11:45.110 --> 02:11:46.880
<v Speaker 2>how's it been working with Jimmy Smith?</v>

5446
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:47.840
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>

5447
02:11:48.650 --> 02:11:49.483
<v Speaker 2>He's brilliant.</v>

5448
02:11:49.670 --> 02:11:50.311
<v Speaker 2>He's a very smart,</v>

5449
02:11:50.311 --> 02:11:51.860
<v Speaker 2>trying to get him hired about four years ago.</v>

5450
02:11:52.350 --> 02:11:54.080
<v Speaker 2>And it was because the UFC was looking for God,</v>

5451
02:11:54.110 --> 02:11:54.471
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

5452

5457
02:12:00.411 --> 02:12:01.131

02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:25.370
<v Speaker 2>it'll be a good time.</v>

5480
02:12:25.690 --> 02:12:30.260
<v Speaker 2>He cut his teeth doing a TV show about combat sports.</v>

5481
02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:30.980
<v Speaker 2>More about,</v>

5482
02:12:30.980 --> 02:12:33.590
<v Speaker 2>he did [inaudible] around the world or whatever.</v>

5483
02:12:33.591 --> 02:12:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Learning different arts.</v>

5484
02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Was it called fight support?</v>

5485
02:12:36.050 --> 02:12:36.771
<v Speaker 2>What was it called?</v>

5486
02:12:36.771 --> 02:12:37.311
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

5487
02:12:37.311 --> 02:12:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Fight quest fight.</v>

5488
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:40.183
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

5489
02:12:40.190 --> 02:12:40.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5490
02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:41.510
<v Speaker 2>he did that.</v>

5491
02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:43.280
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I think he's,</v>

5492
02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:47.870
<v Speaker 2>but he also had MMA fights and he's a legit black belt in Jujitsu.</v>

5493
02:12:48.110 --> 02:12:48.680
<v Speaker 2>He's no,</v>

5494
02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:49.370
<v Speaker 2>he knows this stuff.</v>

5495
02:12:49.370 --> 02:12:51.560
<v Speaker 2>Super Smart and well read guy too.</v>

5496
02:12:51.650 --> 02:12:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5497
02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:52.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

5498
02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:52.851
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited.</v>

5499
02:12:52.851 --> 02:12:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited that he's on board.</v>

5500
02:12:54.021 --> 02:12:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5501
02:12:54.530 --> 02:12:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I always liked listening to him.</v>

5502
02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:55.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5503
02:12:55.911 --> 02:12:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Bella tour fucked up.</v>

5504
02:12:57.200 --> 02:12:58.160
<v Speaker 2>They fucked up and they left.</v>

5505
02:12:58.190 --> 02:12:58.580
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>

5506
02:12:58.580 --> 02:12:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering what,</v>

5507
02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:00.720
<v Speaker 2>so what,</v>

5508
02:13:00.730 --> 02:13:01.060
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

5509
02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:01.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm not to Pry,</v>

5510
02:13:01.971 --> 02:13:05.240
<v Speaker 2>but my guess was he just asked for more money probably because he has an offer</v>

5511
02:13:05.241 --> 02:13:06.050
<v Speaker 2>from the UFC,</v>

5512
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:06.890
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't match it.</v>

5513
02:13:06.891 --> 02:13:07.670
<v Speaker 2>So he took,</v>

5514
02:13:07.670 --> 02:13:08.001
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5515
02:13:08.001 --> 02:13:08.420
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

5516
02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:12.350
<v Speaker 2>they didn't want him leaving for the UFC four years ago when I tried to get him</v>

5517
02:13:12.351 --> 02:13:12.741
<v Speaker 2>hired.</v>

5518
02:13:12.741 --> 02:13:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5519
02:13:13.010 --> 02:13:13.940
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

5520
02:13:14.060 --> 02:13:17.810
<v Speaker 2>there was like a big hullabaloo and they wound up keeping them.</v>

5521
02:13:18.050 --> 02:13:22.040
<v Speaker 2>And then I think his contract was up and I think the way he described it was</v>

5522
02:13:22.041 --> 02:13:23.660
<v Speaker 2>they actually wanted to give him less money.</v>

5523
02:13:24.090 --> 02:13:24.740
<v Speaker 2>He was getting,</v>

5524
02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:28.490
<v Speaker 2>and I think they're just experiencing some severe budget cuts.</v>

5525
02:13:28.730 --> 02:13:30.890
<v Speaker 2>If you think about Bella tours market,</v>

5526
02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 2>like what they're trying</v>

5527
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:32.730
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

5528
02:13:32.730 --> 02:13:34.560
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a paper view business.</v>

5529
02:13:34.590 --> 02:13:34.751
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5530
02:13:34.751 --> 02:13:35.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5531
02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:36.720
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't have a paper review business,</v>

5532
02:13:36.721 --> 02:13:38.730
<v Speaker 1>where's the bulk of all your money coming from?</v>

5533
02:13:38.731 --> 02:13:40.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like kind of bleeding Viacom.</v>

5534
02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5535
02:13:40.860 --> 02:13:41.340
<v Speaker 1>I just thought,</v>

5536
02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:42.030
<v Speaker 1>I just thought,</v>

5537
02:13:42.030 --> 02:13:42.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5538
02:13:42.301 --> 02:13:43.134
<v Speaker 1>when it happened,</v>

5539
02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:44.431
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

5540
02:13:44.431 --> 02:13:47.910
<v Speaker 1>why didn't they change the name when coker was brought in to takeover?</v>

5541
02:13:47.930 --> 02:13:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5542
02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:50.970
<v Speaker 1>It made zero sense to me because Bella tour had that,</v>

5543
02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:52.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5544
02:13:52.231 --> 02:13:53.220
<v Speaker 1>from Bjorn Rep knee.</v>

5545
02:13:53.221 --> 02:13:57.510
<v Speaker 1>I've never been to Bjorn revenue fan Bjorn revenue from that boxing promoter</v>

5546
02:13:57.511 --> 02:13:58.080
<v Speaker 1>type,</v>

5547
02:13:58.080 --> 02:13:58.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5548
02:13:58.491 --> 02:13:59.324
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>

5549
02:13:59.730 --> 02:14:01.800
<v Speaker 1>And everybody that I talked to in that,</v>

5550
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:03.210
<v Speaker 1>in that business,</v>

5551
02:14:03.330 --> 02:14:05.820
<v Speaker 1>they were all terrified and intimidated and everything else.</v>

5552
02:14:06.010 --> 02:14:06.541
<v Speaker 1>A lot of shit.</v>

5553
02:14:06.541 --> 02:14:06.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5554
02:14:06.841 --> 02:14:07.381
<v Speaker 1>it was just a lot.</v>

5555
02:14:07.381 --> 02:14:08.071
<v Speaker 1>I never met the guy.</v>

5556
02:14:08.071 --> 02:14:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about him other than the bad things that I've heard from</v>

5557
02:14:10.531 --> 02:14:10.850
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>

5558
02:14:10.850 --> 02:14:11.131
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5559
02:14:11.131 --> 02:14:12.180
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

5560
02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:13.710
<v Speaker 1>King Mo calling him a Dick Rider,</v>

5561
02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:17.670
<v Speaker 1>kick low king king,</v>

5562
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:19.920
<v Speaker 1>King Mo and I go back and forth on,</v>

5563
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.581
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet,</v>

5564
02:14:20.581 --> 02:14:21.414
<v Speaker 1>on Facebook and stuff.</v>

5565
02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I'll deliberately piss him off on po political stuff and just get him,</v>

5566
02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:26.790
<v Speaker 1>get him,</v>

5567
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:29.640
<v Speaker 1>get him Sunday or appreciated talent when it comes to fighting.</v>

5568
02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:30.141
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5569
02:14:30.141 --> 02:14:30.420
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

5570
02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:33.030
<v Speaker 1>he that guy was a monster.</v>

5571
02:14:33.031 --> 02:14:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Physical problems though.</v>

5572
02:14:34.141 --> 02:14:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Like with the Mercer,</v>

5573
02:14:35.550 --> 02:14:37.700
<v Speaker 1>he had some serious staph infection.</v>

5574
02:14:37.770 --> 02:14:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5575
02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Some real bad ones that wrecked him.</v>

5576
02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:41.730
<v Speaker 1>That fucking shit scared.</v>

5577
02:14:41.731 --> 02:14:42.361
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy though.</v>

5578
02:14:42.361 --> 02:14:42.870
<v Speaker 1>We talk,</v>

5579
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:44.880
<v Speaker 1>we talk now and then when I see a good stuff he has,</v>

5580
02:14:44.881 --> 02:14:45.714
<v Speaker 1>he's cool dude.</v>

5581
02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:46.783
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

5582
02:14:46.890 --> 02:14:47.490
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

5583
02:14:47.490 --> 02:14:47.731
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

5584
02:14:47.731 --> 02:14:49.290
<v Speaker 1>where were we when we were talking about,</v>

5585
02:14:49.291 --> 02:14:51.990
<v Speaker 1>but we should have changed the name.</v>

5586
02:14:52.410 --> 02:14:55.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just synonymous with tournaments and the guy loses a title and suddenly</v>

5587
02:14:55.921 --> 02:14:57.030
<v Speaker 1>he's thrown back into a tournament.</v>

5588
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:58.020
<v Speaker 1>He's already made his name.</v>

5589
02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:00.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just a shitty business model.</v>

5590
02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:03.510
<v Speaker 1>And Bella Torah was for the Spanish speaking crowd,</v>

5591
02:15:03.511 --> 02:15:03.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5592
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what they were trying to get out of that whole thing word right?</v>

5593
02:15:07.220 --> 02:15:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's or Roman word for gladiator or some shit.</v>

5594
02:15:10.141 --> 02:15:10.471
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

5595
02:15:10.471 --> 02:15:12.030
<v Speaker 1>it started out as,</v>

5596
02:15:12.031 --> 02:15:12.864
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5597

5598
02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:18.540
<v Speaker 1>but it just didn't make sense with coke taken over.</v>

5599
02:15:18.541 --> 02:15:22.150
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to watch the Geritol posy fight.</v>

5600
02:15:23.070 --> 02:15:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see a pap military flight.</v>

5601
02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:25.191
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind.</v>

5602
02:15:25.191 --> 02:15:26.024

<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

5609
02:15:31.351 --> 02:15:31.770

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5611
02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:33.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a young man's sport.</v>

5612
02:15:33.271 --> 02:15:34.680
<v Speaker 1>It's guys that are animals,</v>

5613
02:15:34.681 --> 02:15:35.461
<v Speaker 1>fast movers,</v>

02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:41.900
<v Speaker 1>invincible human beings in their mid twenties to thirties early thirties I guy</v>

5617
02:15:43.651 --> 02:15:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

5618
02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:44.290
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

5619
02:15:44.290 --> 02:15:47.610
<v Speaker 1>just 45 but 45 years old with MMA miles on them.</v>

5620
02:15:47.630 --> 02:15:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5621
02:15:48.030 --> 02:15:48.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the real issue,</v>

5622
02:15:49.110 --> 02:15:49.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5623
02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:50.250
<v Speaker 1>It's that these guys,</v>

5624
02:15:50.251 --> 02:15:54.000
<v Speaker 1>their bodies have been beaten up for so many decades in the gym and all the</v>

5625
02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.930
<v Speaker 1>years of wrestling and kickboxing and yeah,</v>

5626
02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:57.480
<v Speaker 1>they're just not the same.</v>

5627
02:15:57.510 --> 02:15:58.280
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5628
02:15:58.280 --> 02:15:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5629
02:15:58.680 --> 02:15:59.490
<v Speaker 1>It takes its toll.</v>

5630
02:15:59.490 --> 02:16:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It definitely takes its toll and you're just not,</v>

5631
02:16:02.010 --> 02:16:02.761
<v Speaker 1>you're just not the same.</v>

5632
02:16:02.761 --> 02:16:02.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5633
02:16:02.941 --> 02:16:04.970
<v Speaker 1>there's part of me that respects the shit out of a guy like hoists.</v>

5634
02:16:04.971 --> 02:16:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Gracie is still a fucking savage.</v>

5635
02:16:06.661 --> 02:16:09.390
<v Speaker 1>If 50 years of age ready to throw down with anybody,</v>

5636
02:16:09.391 --> 02:16:10.380
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't fight me.</v>

5637
02:16:10.620 --> 02:16:11.453
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't sign up.</v>

5638
02:16:11.550 --> 02:16:12.383
<v Speaker 1>When was this?</v>

5639
02:16:12.630 --> 02:16:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to,</v>

5640
02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5641
02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5642
02:16:14.580 --> 02:16:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean with Bella tour,</v>

5643
02:16:15.540 --> 02:16:16.111
<v Speaker 1>I said pricking,</v>

5644
02:16:16.111 --> 02:16:17.330
<v Speaker 1>get Gracie to fight me.</v>

5645
02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:18.960
<v Speaker 1>When he was fighting Shamrock,</v>

5646
02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I confronted shamrock on access.</v>

5647
02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:23.560
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the worst fights that I had passed.</v>

5648
02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:25.710
<v Speaker 1>When Matt beat the Shit out of him,</v>

5649
02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Matt took his back,</v>

5650
02:16:27.330 --> 02:16:29.320
<v Speaker 1>was smashed him and I was like,</v>

5651
02:16:29.321 --> 02:16:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

5652
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:30.641
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5653
02:16:30.641 --> 02:16:31.360
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

5654
02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:33.400
<v Speaker 1>this is so mismatched.</v>

5655
02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:36.010
<v Speaker 1>So the voices in a different era and Matt is,</v>

5656
02:16:36.130 --> 02:16:37.540
<v Speaker 1>even though Matt's not ranked,</v>

5657
02:16:37.541 --> 02:16:39.190
<v Speaker 1>he's a legit blackbelt right,</v>

5658
02:16:39.250 --> 02:16:39.640
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5659
02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:42.940
<v Speaker 1>And a stud wrestler and a physical freak,</v>

5660
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:48.030
<v Speaker 1>an end super experienced with modern high level MMA hoists was living in the</v>

5661
02:16:49.241 --> 02:16:50.074
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

5662
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:51.190
<v Speaker 1>And the thing was with that,</v>

5663
02:16:51.191 --> 02:16:54.220
<v Speaker 1>that was after rob Lawler worry mark on myself,</v>

5664
02:16:54.221 --> 02:16:54.911
<v Speaker 1>Tim Silvia,</v>

5665
02:16:54.911 --> 02:16:55.541
<v Speaker 1>Gann Mcgee,</v>

5666
02:16:55.541 --> 02:16:56.231
<v Speaker 1>Chuck Lidell,</v>

5667
02:16:56.231 --> 02:16:58.240
<v Speaker 1>all of us were on that movie set in Mexico,</v>

5668
02:16:58.900 --> 02:16:59.890
<v Speaker 1>that Paul Walker film.</v>

5669
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5670
02:17:00.550 --> 02:17:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5671
02:17:01.210 --> 02:17:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Paul was great guy.</v>

5672
02:17:01.940 --> 02:17:02.320
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

5673
02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:04.330
<v Speaker 1>he was legitimately a good human being.</v>

5674
02:17:04.331 --> 02:17:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you knew him and all that.</v>

5675
02:17:05.531 --> 02:17:06.161
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't know him,</v>

5676
02:17:06.161 --> 02:17:06.994
<v Speaker 1>but I heard the stuff,</v>

5677
02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:10.780
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that he did on the set to stick up for the small guys was incredible.</v>

5678
02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we got time to talk about it,</v>

5679
02:17:12.401 --> 02:17:13.030
<v Speaker 1>but not,</v>

5680
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.481
<v Speaker 1>we're not.</v>

5681
02:17:13.481 --> 02:17:14.290
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

5682
02:17:14.290 --> 02:17:15.123
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5683
02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:16.590
<v Speaker 1>we had gotten done with that.</v>

5684
02:17:16.610 --> 02:17:19.060
<v Speaker 1>We'd become friends with Paul Walker and Oakley Lemon,</v>

5685
02:17:19.061 --> 02:17:21.400
<v Speaker 1>who was his stunt double for everything.</v>

5686
02:17:21.401 --> 02:17:21.920
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

5687
02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:22.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5688
02:17:22.450 --> 02:17:24.310
<v Speaker 1>the stunt guys were all really cool with us.</v>

5689
02:17:24.550 --> 02:17:27.280
<v Speaker 1>We kind of gravitate towards them because there's stunt guys when we're</v>

5690
02:17:27.281 --> 02:17:27.671
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>

5691
02:17:27.671 --> 02:17:28.750
<v Speaker 1>We got along really well with them,</v>

5692
02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:31.150
<v Speaker 1>but Laurence Fishburne was on the set,</v>

5693
02:17:31.151 --> 02:17:32.080
<v Speaker 1>the Keratin brothers,</v>

5694
02:17:32.081 --> 02:17:32.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5695
02:17:32.610 --> 02:17:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm a kid from Iowa going,</v>

5696
02:17:34.001 --> 02:17:34.960
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking awesome,</v>

5697
02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:35.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5698
02:17:35.230 --> 02:17:35.501
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>

5699
02:17:35.501 --> 02:17:36.334
<v Speaker 1>these are cool too.</v>

5700
02:17:36.350 --> 02:17:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

5701
02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:37.780
<v Speaker 1>just to be around these guys.</v>

5702
02:17:37.781 --> 02:17:38.950
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

5703
02:17:39.220 --> 02:17:44.220
<v Speaker 1>so they were all at that fight in La and Paul Walker and all his actor buddies</v>

5704
02:17:44.321 --> 02:17:45.011
<v Speaker 1>were in one row,</v>

5705
02:17:45.011 --> 02:17:48.010
<v Speaker 1>right behind them was Oakley lemon and all his stunt guys.</v>

5706
02:17:48.310 --> 02:17:52.570
<v Speaker 1>And so Paul Walker was a Gracie Jujitsu student.</v>

5707
02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:54.340
<v Speaker 1>He loved that.</v>

5708
02:17:54.580 --> 02:17:56.950
<v Speaker 1>And so they were cheering for voice.</v>

5709
02:17:56.980 --> 02:17:58.360
<v Speaker 1>All the stunt guys were treating from that.</v>

5710
02:17:59.020 --> 02:17:59.890
<v Speaker 1>They're the hardcore,</v>

5711
02:17:59.891 --> 02:18:00.250
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

5712
02:18:00.250 --> 02:18:00.850
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

5713
02:18:00.850 --> 02:18:01.683
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

5714
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Matt just dismantles it rex and completely,</v>

5715
02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:07.180
<v Speaker 1>and I turn around,</v>

5716
02:18:07.181 --> 02:18:10.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm up on the deck outside the cage and I turned around and Paul Walker and all</v>

5717
02:18:10.931 --> 02:18:13.330
<v Speaker 1>this actor buddies are like the US like Holy Shit.</v>

5718
02:18:13.330 --> 02:18:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

5719
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this just happened standing on the chairs.</v>

5720
02:18:16.901 --> 02:18:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Behind them is Oakley Lemon and all the,</v>

5721
02:18:19.210 --> 02:18:20.280
<v Speaker 1>all the stunt guys going,</v>

5722
02:18:20.530 --> 02:18:21.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5723
02:18:21.050 --> 02:18:21.883
<v Speaker 1>military.</v>

5724
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:22.930
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

5725
02:18:23.230 --> 02:18:23.920
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

5726
02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:24.430
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

5727
02:18:24.430 --> 02:18:27.790
<v Speaker 1>but I saw half that crowd crying.</v>

5728
02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5729
02:18:28.330 --> 02:18:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Cause they saw a god get destroyed.</v>

5730
02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:34.780
<v Speaker 1>But I mean this is a hero to hoist is like for martial arts.</v>

5731
02:18:34.810 --> 02:18:35.590
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

5732
02:18:35.590 --> 02:18:37.090
<v Speaker 1>he was a legitimate hero.</v>

5733
02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:40.240
<v Speaker 1>He was the first guy to win the ultimate fighting championship.</v>

5734
02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:42.490
<v Speaker 1>And the way he did it was like,</v>

5735
02:18:42.491 --> 02:18:42.671
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

5736

5738
02:18:45.571 --> 02:18:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Little skinny guy.</v>

5739
02:18:46.751 --> 02:18:47.710
<v Speaker 1>There's just mainly people.</v>

5740
02:18:47.711 --> 02:18:50.020
<v Speaker 1>And the thing was with all of that,</v>

5741
02:18:50.110 --> 02:18:50.943
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5742
02:18:51.550 --> 02:18:54.910
<v Speaker 1>then the Gracies came back with Hughes was just a better athlete and used all</v>

5743
02:18:54.911 --> 02:18:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

5744
02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Gracie Jujitsu to beat Gracie Jiu Jitsu.</v>

5745
02:18:58.270 --> 02:18:59.620
<v Speaker 1>So I went through all the stuff.</v>

5746
02:18:59.621 --> 02:19:02.030
<v Speaker 1>He hit a duck under on hoist when hoists tried to hit him with an elbow.</v>

5747
02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:02.271
<v Speaker 1>The road,</v>

5748
02:19:02.271 --> 02:19:05.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like hitting with a half Nelson when hoy started regained guard,</v>

5749
02:19:05.171 --> 02:19:06.040
<v Speaker 1>when Matt took his back,</v>

5750
02:19:06.041 --> 02:19:07.810
<v Speaker 1>that was just a bunch of wrestling mixed in there.</v>

5751
02:19:07.930 --> 02:19:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5752
02:19:08.710 --> 02:19:11.440
<v Speaker 1>And so then they brought out Alomeda.</v>

5753
02:19:11.470 --> 02:19:11.651
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

5754
02:19:11.651 --> 02:19:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Meda was their dog to come and beat Matt.</v>

5755
02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5756
02:19:14.260 --> 02:19:17.110
<v Speaker 1>So they put in Alomeda who was bigger than that?</v>

5757
02:19:17.260 --> 02:19:17.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5758
02:19:17.501 --> 02:19:18.970
<v Speaker 1>he's a big dude for that weight division.</v>

5759
02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:19.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5760
02:19:19.961 --> 02:19:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Matt deliberately hit him with a wrestling front headlock and choke him</v>

5761
02:19:22.391 --> 02:19:22.990
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

5762
02:19:22.990 --> 02:19:23.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5763
02:19:23.231 --> 02:19:26.410
<v Speaker 1>it was a position that a lot of Jujitsu guys are used to being in there and they</v>

5764
02:19:26.411 --> 02:19:27.250
<v Speaker 1>just relaxed.</v>

5765
02:19:27.350 --> 02:19:28.190
<v Speaker 1>They're waiting for you to spin</v>

5766
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:29.023
<v Speaker 2>to the back,</v>

5767
02:19:29.090 --> 02:19:30.800
<v Speaker 2>but instead of spinning to the back matches,</v>

5768
02:19:30.801 --> 02:19:31.970
<v Speaker 2>crank that sucker down.</v>

5769
02:19:31.971 --> 02:19:33.370
<v Speaker 2>When you shut off your stuff,</v>

5770
02:19:33.380 --> 02:19:37.080
<v Speaker 2>the head under the armpit and you crank that down and then twist it,</v>

5771
02:19:37.170 --> 02:19:37.650
<v Speaker 2>crushed it.</v>

5772
02:19:37.650 --> 02:19:38.151
<v Speaker 2>You just get,</v>

5773
02:19:38.151 --> 02:19:38.751
<v Speaker 2>you get choked.</v>

5774
02:19:38.751 --> 02:19:40.640
<v Speaker 2>That's all there is actually a gorilla like Matt.</v>

5775
02:19:40.670 --> 02:19:41.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5776
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:42.230
<v Speaker 2>And so when they did the interview,</v>

5777
02:19:42.231 --> 02:19:44.150
<v Speaker 2>you were probably the guy doing the interview and he goes,</v>

5778
02:19:44.540 --> 02:19:44.901
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

5779
02:19:44.901 --> 02:19:45.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5780
02:19:45.141 --> 02:19:49.160
<v Speaker 2>it was just nice to use wrestling on a Jujitsu and to cut him unconscious.</v>

5781
02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Not just yet.</v>

5782
02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:52.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Ricardo knew that that could put them out.</v>

5783
02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5784
02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:53.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5785
02:19:53.250 --> 02:19:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of us have been in those positions before,</v>

5786
02:19:55.821 --> 02:19:59.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's usually a transitionary position where a guy turns and gets you back on</v>

5787
02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:00.890
<v Speaker 2>like no one's ever done it since either,</v>

5788
02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:01.390
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

5789
02:20:01.390 --> 02:20:01.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5790
02:20:01.730 --> 02:20:03.440
<v Speaker 2>no one's ever talked to the guy on the wrestling.</v>

5791
02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:04.191
<v Speaker 2>Guys in wrestling,</v>

5792
02:20:04.191 --> 02:20:05.180
<v Speaker 2>we'll use that stuff.</v>

5793
02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:08.030
<v Speaker 2>You know like Dave little bitch who wrestled for Purdue,</v>

5794
02:20:08.031 --> 02:20:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Dave and Julie A.</v>

5795
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:09.011
<v Speaker 2>Little bit,</v>

5796
02:20:09.011 --> 02:20:09.111
<v Speaker 2>Jay,</v>

5797
02:20:09.111 --> 02:20:13.370
<v Speaker 2>we're all Americans at Purdue and they were beasts and obviously little bitch.</v>

5798
02:20:13.371 --> 02:20:15.860
<v Speaker 2>They were Croatian psycho correlations in Michigan City,</v>

5799
02:20:15.861 --> 02:20:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Indiana where they grew up and little bitch used to use a move that they named</v>

5800
02:20:20.061 --> 02:20:22.880
<v Speaker 2>the little bitch where it was a,</v>

5801
02:20:23.900 --> 02:20:25.640
<v Speaker 2>you'd include what the fuck is the name of it,</v>

5802
02:20:25.641 --> 02:20:26.211
<v Speaker 2>not a Doris,</v>

5803
02:20:26.211 --> 02:20:27.290
<v Speaker 2>but Anaconda.</v>

5804
02:20:27.450 --> 02:20:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Anaconda.</v>

5805
02:20:28.010 --> 02:20:31.370
<v Speaker 2>It was an anaconda in college wrestling and it looked like you had a front</v>

5806
02:20:31.371 --> 02:20:33.980
<v Speaker 2>headlock and he would choke people unconscious.</v>

5807
02:20:33.981 --> 02:20:34.880
<v Speaker 2>As soon as they'd go lip,</v>

5808
02:20:34.881 --> 02:20:35.810
<v Speaker 2>he'd grab the chin,</v>

5809
02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:36.730
<v Speaker 2>roll him and pin him.</v>

5810
02:20:37.090 --> 02:20:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

5811
02:20:37.650 --> 02:20:42.320
<v Speaker 2>he was doing that with Turner about that Dave Little Bitch pin bill Tate from</v>

5812
02:20:42.321 --> 02:20:42.831
<v Speaker 2>Iowa state.</v>

5813
02:20:42.831 --> 02:20:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Bill Tate was a Waterloo,</v>

5814
02:20:43.761 --> 02:20:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Iowa guy and he put them asleep.</v>

5815
02:20:45.310 --> 02:20:46.760
<v Speaker 2>He put them asleep and pinned him in the,</v>

5816
02:20:46.761 --> 02:20:48.140
<v Speaker 2>in the NCAA championships.</v>

5817
02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:48.973
<v Speaker 2>Is that illegal?</v>

5818
02:20:49.220 --> 02:20:49.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5819
02:20:49.341 --> 02:20:50.151
<v Speaker 2>it's totally illegal.</v>

5820
02:20:50.151 --> 02:20:52.760
<v Speaker 2>But referees didn't understand it because it looked like you had the arm</v>

5821
02:20:52.761 --> 02:20:53.720
<v Speaker 2>included in the headlock.</v>

5822
02:20:53.721 --> 02:20:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

5823
02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:54.350
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5824
02:20:54.350 --> 02:20:56.660
<v Speaker 2>But if you do have an arm included in a headlock,</v>

5825
02:20:56.850 --> 02:20:58.580
<v Speaker 2>well is it your fault if the guy goes asleep?</v>

5826
02:20:58.581 --> 02:20:59.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5827
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.600
<v Speaker 2>none at all.</v>

5828
02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:01.070
<v Speaker 2>But see what it is when he go to pin him,</v>

5829
02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:02.840
<v Speaker 2>if the referee recognized he went limp,</v>

5830
02:21:02.841 --> 02:21:05.880
<v Speaker 2>they would stop the match for a potentially dangerous hold or whatever she'd</v>

5831
02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:10.090
<v Speaker 2>have to do is get some of these really bad UFC referees to referee wrestling and</v>

5832
02:21:10.130 --> 02:21:11.570
<v Speaker 2>they would have no idea who that guy was that.</v>

5833
02:21:11.571 --> 02:21:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5834
02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5835
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:14.660
<v Speaker 2>But there's guys doing the juicy at the NCAAS,</v>

5836
02:21:14.661 --> 02:21:16.700
<v Speaker 2>the guy hitting the key lock on the guy trying to break his arm.</v>

5837
02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:17.600
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5838
02:21:17.930 --> 02:21:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5839
02:21:18.380 --> 02:21:21.170
<v Speaker 2>didn't I'm Mark Schultz do that in the Olympics.</v>

5840
02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:22.071
<v Speaker 2>All,</v>

5841
02:21:22.071 --> 02:21:22.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5842
02:21:22.311 --> 02:21:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if the guy's fucking arm off with that.</v>

5843
02:21:24.630 --> 02:21:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5844
02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:26.510
<v Speaker 2>I believe he's disqualified.</v>

5845
02:21:26.530 --> 02:21:30.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Schultz brothers were just scaring and Dave Schultz was unbeatable</v>

5846
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:31.400
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

5847
02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:33.560
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to build people to beat him over in Russia.</v>

5848
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:34.010
<v Speaker 2>When Ma,</v>

5849
02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:35.240
<v Speaker 2>remember when mark fought,</v>

5850
02:21:35.330 --> 02:21:36.800
<v Speaker 2>he fought big daddy Goodrich,</v>

5851
02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:38.330
<v Speaker 2>truly Marette rag doll.</v>

5852
02:21:38.780 --> 02:21:40.910
<v Speaker 2>But then in the movie they had,</v>

5853
02:21:40.970 --> 02:21:42.590
<v Speaker 2>they used a different guy.</v>

5854
02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:45.290
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have him fight in big daddy Goodrich in the movie.</v>

5855
02:21:45.291 --> 02:21:46.580
<v Speaker 2>They had him fight some Russian.</v>

5856
02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:47.930
<v Speaker 2>It was at Fox catcher or something.</v>

5857
02:21:47.931 --> 02:21:49.130
<v Speaker 2>It was a bullshit scene.</v>

5858
02:21:49.131 --> 02:21:49.461
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5859
02:21:49.461 --> 02:21:50.570
<v Speaker 2>why would you do that?</v>

5860
02:21:50.571 --> 02:21:52.130
<v Speaker 2>This is actual real history.</v>

5861
02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:56.180
<v Speaker 2>You really have a guy who's like one of the best wrestlers to ever fight in MMA.</v>

5862
02:21:56.181 --> 02:21:56.990
<v Speaker 2>To us,</v>

5863
02:21:56.990 --> 02:22:00.020
<v Speaker 2>it was a real historical moment and he took it on last second notice.</v>

5864
02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:01.360
<v Speaker 2>He fought big daddy Goodrich.</v>

5865
02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:02.330
<v Speaker 2>We all remember it.</v>

5866
02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:03.920
<v Speaker 2>But in this fucking movie,</v>

5867
02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:05.000
<v Speaker 2>you faked it.</v>

5868
02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:06.110
<v Speaker 2>You put someone else in.</v>

5869
02:22:06.170 --> 02:22:07.520
<v Speaker 2>So what else did you fake?</v>

5870
02:22:07.850 --> 02:22:12.380
<v Speaker 2>The bullshit was in this movie we are pretending this is a historical recreation</v>

5871
02:22:12.620 --> 02:22:15.390
<v Speaker 2>of a real national crime that everybody heard about.</v>

5872
02:22:15.391 --> 02:22:19.340
<v Speaker 2>It was a real tragedy and it was a tragedy against a guy who was one of the best</v>

5873
02:22:19.341 --> 02:22:21.780
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers that America had to offer for.</v>

5874
02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:22.881
<v Speaker 2>I felt,</v>

5875
02:22:22.881 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I felt like it was one of the worst examples</v>

5876
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:27.480
<v Speaker 1>of what Hollywood does.</v>

5877
02:22:27.481 --> 02:22:29.970
<v Speaker 1>The arrogance of Hollywood due to a real story,</v>

5878
02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:30.863
<v Speaker 1>a real story.</v>

5879
02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:32.280
<v Speaker 1>They just decided,</v>

5880
02:22:32.310 --> 02:22:33.330
<v Speaker 1>fuck big daddy,</v>

5881
02:22:33.331 --> 02:22:33.721
<v Speaker 1>good rich.</v>

5882
02:22:33.721 --> 02:22:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Why have him in there and would be like Mike Tyson pretending Mike Tyson won the</v>

5883
02:22:38.641 --> 02:22:41.160
<v Speaker 1>fucking world title against Ivan Drago or something.</v>

5884
02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:41.461
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

5885
02:22:41.461 --> 02:22:45.540
<v Speaker 1>it would be something everybody knows what the real fight was.</v>

5886
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:46.663
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5887
02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:49.230
<v Speaker 1>being an Iowa Guy,</v>

5888
02:22:49.290 --> 02:22:52.800
<v Speaker 1>this whole California experience and Hollywood and all this stuff freaks me the</v>

5889
02:22:52.801 --> 02:22:53.220
<v Speaker 1>fuck out.</v>

5890
02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:53.670
<v Speaker 1>It should.</v>

5891
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:55.640
<v Speaker 1>It does was just some I,</v>

5892
02:22:55.641 --> 02:22:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I was out here pitching TV shows before the ultimate fighter.</v>

5893
02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I was pitching on ultimate ultimate fighter show to Kevin Riley,</v>

5894
02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:06.360
<v Speaker 1>who was the president of NBC at the time,</v>

5895
02:23:06.900 --> 02:23:08.220
<v Speaker 1>and John Hirschfeld,</v>

5896
02:23:08.221 --> 02:23:09.054
<v Speaker 1>who you know,</v>

5897
02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:09.511
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5898
02:23:09.511 --> 02:23:10.440
<v Speaker 1>John Hirschfield goes,</v>

5899
02:23:10.441 --> 02:23:10.621
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

5900
02:23:10.621 --> 02:23:11.431
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have maybe five,</v>

5901
02:23:11.431 --> 02:23:12.420
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes with these people,</v>

5902
02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:13.433
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5903
02:23:13.740 --> 02:23:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I had them laughing for an hour and a half and they're like,</v>

5904
02:23:16.711 --> 02:23:17.544
<v Speaker 1>this is awesome.</v>

5905
02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:18.540
<v Speaker 1>I love this show.</v>

5906
02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I love this idea and mine was much different than the ultimate fighter.</v>

5907
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5908
02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:23.250
<v Speaker 1>It actually made sense.</v>

5909
02:23:23.251 --> 02:23:26.880
<v Speaker 1>The four pillars of MMA and competing in each one and all that sort of stuff.</v>

5910
02:23:26.881 --> 02:23:27.714
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5911
02:23:28.650 --> 02:23:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5912
02:23:28.980 --> 02:23:30.990
<v Speaker 1>he called us personally and he goes,</v>

5913
02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:32.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5914
02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:33.960
<v Speaker 1>the board talked about it and the board just,</v>

5915
02:23:33.961 --> 02:23:34.530
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

5916
02:23:34.530 --> 02:23:35.363
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get it through.</v>

5917
02:23:35.620 --> 02:23:39.150
<v Speaker 1>They just don't feel mainstreams ready for this type of thing and all that.</v>

5918
02:23:39.151 --> 02:23:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Then the ultimate fighter came out on spike and the rest was history,</v>

5919
02:23:41.791 --> 02:23:45.060
<v Speaker 1>but every time I had one show sold to stars,</v>

5920
02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:47.460
<v Speaker 1>the guy that used to be the president of the Hbo,</v>

5921
02:23:47.461 --> 02:23:48.294
<v Speaker 1>I remember him.</v>

5922
02:23:48.510 --> 02:23:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Which guy?</v>

5923
02:23:49.230 --> 02:23:50.490
<v Speaker 1>The guy that got in trouble,</v>

5924
02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:51.051
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5925
02:23:51.051 --> 02:23:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5926
02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:52.440
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember his name now off.</v>

5927
02:23:52.460 --> 02:23:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I remember Brett Rhett know rex now I can all Breck.</v>

5928
02:23:56.910 --> 02:23:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5929
02:23:57.660 --> 02:23:58.231
<v Speaker 1>Chris Albrecht.</v>

5930
02:23:58.231 --> 02:23:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Chris Albright.</v>

5931
02:23:58.920 --> 02:23:59.753
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

5932
02:24:00.030 --> 02:24:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I had a show sold and then they were going to co brand it with Spartacus and</v>

5933
02:24:04.441 --> 02:24:07.890
<v Speaker 1>then the lead actor from Spartacus got terminal cancer and they couldn't cope</v>

5934
02:24:07.891 --> 02:24:09.600
<v Speaker 1>random together and that deal fell apart.</v>

5935
02:24:09.630 --> 02:24:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Then another one that I had sold fell apart because of the collapse in 2008 and</v>

5936
02:24:13.591 --> 02:24:13.981
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5937
02:24:13.981 --> 02:24:14.161
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

5938
02:24:14.161 --> 02:24:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I can't win anything.</v>

5939
02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Like deal set business.</v>

5940
02:24:17.791 --> 02:24:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Also like if you're an outsider and you're coming in here to try to pitch</v>

5941
02:24:20.881 --> 02:24:21.121
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

5942
02:24:21.121 --> 02:24:23.310
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people they already know that they're pitching things,</v>

5943
02:24:23.311 --> 02:24:23.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5944
02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to imagine if you're a guy that's a producer or you know,</v>

5945
02:24:26.641 --> 02:24:27.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5946
02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:27.511
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5947
02:24:27.511 --> 02:24:29.370
<v Speaker 1>an executive rather at some sort of a network,</v>

5948
02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:32.150
<v Speaker 1>you've got people knocking on your door all day long.</v>

5949
02:24:32.151 --> 02:24:35.490
<v Speaker 1>You're used to quality from certain people or when you want to see you've seen</v>

5950
02:24:35.491 --> 02:24:36.360
<v Speaker 1>their work before.</v>

5951
02:24:37.770 --> 02:24:39.810
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard for an outsider to get in.</v>

5952
02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:40.171
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude,</v>

5953
02:24:40.171 --> 02:24:41.004
<v Speaker 1>I finally just went,</v>

5954
02:24:41.390 --> 02:24:41.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5955
02:24:41.730 --> 02:24:44.010
<v Speaker 1>I had so many concepts written on a laptop.</v>

5956
02:24:44.011 --> 02:24:46.800
<v Speaker 1>I'd sit up all hours of the night writing concepts for shows,</v>

5957
02:24:46.801 --> 02:24:47.634
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of stuff.</v>

5958
02:24:48.990 --> 02:24:50.400
<v Speaker 1>This thing that you're doing for fun,</v>

5959
02:24:50.850 --> 02:24:52.440
<v Speaker 1>you're a conspiracy farm.</v>

5960
02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:57.440
<v Speaker 1>That's probably your best way in podcasts are the best way in because the build</v>

5961
02:24:57.721 --> 02:25:01.440
<v Speaker 1>an audience and undeniable audience and we want to go to,</v>

5962
02:25:01.470 --> 02:25:01.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5963
02:25:01.950 --> 02:25:02.671
<v Speaker 1>black sites,</v>

5964
02:25:02.671 --> 02:25:03.061
<v Speaker 1>CIA,</v>

5965
02:25:03.061 --> 02:25:03.721
<v Speaker 1>black sites,</v>

5966
02:25:03.721 --> 02:25:04.120
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

5967
02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:07.500
<v Speaker 1>and arrest us and drag our ass in there.</v>

5968
02:25:07.620 --> 02:25:07.921
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5969
02:25:07.921 --> 02:25:09.030
<v Speaker 1>We want to get in trouble,</v>

5970
02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:09.361
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5971
02:25:09.361 --> 02:25:12.060
<v Speaker 1>And we want to go to places where we don't want that.</v>

5972
02:25:12.090 --> 02:25:13.560
<v Speaker 1>We're going to push say you'd want that.</v>

5973
02:25:13.561 --> 02:25:14.340
<v Speaker 1>You don't want that?</v>

5974
02:25:14.340 --> 02:25:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

5975
02:25:15.060 --> 02:25:15.361
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5976
02:25:15.361 --> 02:25:16.111
<v Speaker 1>I get what you're saying.</v>

5977
02:25:16.111 --> 02:25:17.700
<v Speaker 1>But we want to push the envelope,</v>

5978
02:25:17.790 --> 02:25:18.031
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5979
02:25:18.031 --> 02:25:19.470
<v Speaker 1>We want to push the envelope when we want to.</v>

5980
02:25:19.770 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 1>We want to expose the real facts behind what's really going on and that would</v>

5981
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:24.851
<v Speaker 3>cause some heat.</v>

5982
02:25:24.851 --> 02:25:26.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that we eventually get a call.</v>

5983
02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:31.870
<v Speaker 3>You know where you need to kind of divert off the path you're on without a</v>

5984
02:25:31.871 --> 02:25:32.200
<v Speaker 3>doubt.</v>

5985
02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:33.190
<v Speaker 3>You look at forward to that call.</v>

5986
02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:34.710
<v Speaker 3>Are you starting to do a show like that?</v>

5987
02:25:34.750 --> 02:25:35.980
<v Speaker 3>I did Joe Rogan questions,</v>

5988
02:25:35.981 --> 02:25:36.431
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

5989
02:25:36.431 --> 02:25:41.170
<v Speaker 3>but mostly it was on big foot and Ufo stuff.</v>

5990
02:25:41.171 --> 02:25:43.130
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to get in trouble from aliens,</v>

5991
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5992
02:25:43.630 --> 02:25:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5993
02:25:44.380 --> 02:25:47.230
<v Speaker 3>it was mostly almost all bullshit.</v>

5994
02:25:47.290 --> 02:25:48.160
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

5995
02:25:48.161 --> 02:25:51.670
<v Speaker 3>And I was much more interested in conspiracy theories before I did that show,</v>

5996
02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:55.030
<v Speaker 3>but in the six months that I did that show and all these different people that I</v>

5997
02:25:55.031 --> 02:25:56.620
<v Speaker 3>interviewed and all the stuff you saw in the air,</v>

5998
02:25:56.621 --> 02:26:01.621
<v Speaker 3>it was just a fraction of the total mass of all the people that I talk to mostly</v>

5999
02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:02.680
<v Speaker 3>was bullshit.</v>

6000
02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:04.000
<v Speaker 3>Mostly is crazy people.</v>

6001
02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:09.120
<v Speaker 3>Most of these people that just have a bad way of looking at reality,</v>

6002
02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:10.830
<v Speaker 3>like they're there.</v>

6003
02:26:11.300 --> 02:26:14.710
<v Speaker 3>They have confirmation bias and the way they look at things,</v>

6004
02:26:14.711 --> 02:26:18.010
<v Speaker 3>they just have this very distorted version of what the truth is.</v>

6005
02:26:18.190 --> 02:26:20.470
<v Speaker 3>And they also want big foot to be real.</v>

6006
02:26:20.471 --> 02:26:21.880
<v Speaker 3>They want aliens to be real.</v>

6007
02:26:21.881 --> 02:26:25.150
<v Speaker 3>They want the government to be spraying shit out of planes above us all the</v>

6008
02:26:25.151 --> 02:26:25.984
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

6009
02:26:26.050 --> 02:26:26.771
<v Speaker 3>It's all just,</v>

6010
02:26:26.771 --> 02:26:27.604
<v Speaker 3>but we've had,</v>

6011
02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:30.910
<v Speaker 3>we've had Brennan who was head of the CIA admit to that though,</v>

6012
02:26:30.911 --> 02:26:31.360
<v Speaker 3>at least.</v>

6013
02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:31.541
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6014
02:26:31.541 --> 02:26:36.541
<v Speaker 3>they admit to one thing that they have looked into weather modification,</v>

6015
02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:42.600
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that every fucking south west flight is spraying aluminum and all</v>

6016
02:26:42.641 --> 02:26:43.780
<v Speaker 3>this different shit in the air.</v>

6017
02:26:43.810 --> 02:26:44.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6018
02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:44.981
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

6019
02:26:44.981 --> 02:26:48.250
<v Speaker 3>They've experimented on using it for warfare.</v>

6020
02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:48.581
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6021
02:26:48.581 --> 02:26:49.750
<v Speaker 3>they've looked into everything.</v>

6022
02:26:49.751 --> 02:26:50.850
<v Speaker 3>They've looked at [inaudible] house,</v>

6023
02:26:50.851 --> 02:26:52.090
<v Speaker 3>fear over your enemy,</v>

6024
02:26:52.690 --> 02:26:53.201
<v Speaker 3>your enemy,</v>

6025
02:26:53.201 --> 02:26:54.400
<v Speaker 3>and have storms breakout on them.</v>

6026
02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:55.091
<v Speaker 3>There's that.</v>

6027
02:26:55.091 --> 02:26:56.320
<v Speaker 3>And also to,</v>

6028
02:26:56.321 --> 02:26:56.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6029
02:26:56.730 --> 02:26:57.070
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

6030
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:57.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6031
02:26:57.371 --> 02:26:58.151
<v Speaker 3>in Abu Dhabi,</v>

6032
02:26:58.151 --> 02:26:59.410
<v Speaker 3>they make it rain every week.</v>

6033
02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:01.750
<v Speaker 3>They make it rain fell two times a year.</v>

6034
02:27:01.751 --> 02:27:02.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6035
02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:02.950
<v Speaker 3>just do it with,</v>

6036
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:05.050
<v Speaker 3>they just throw money in the air and it fucking rains.</v>

6037
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:09.460
<v Speaker 3>Like they just figured out a way to cloud seed and that cloud seeding has been</v>

6038
02:27:09.461 --> 02:27:10.090
<v Speaker 3>around forever.</v>

6039
02:27:10.090 --> 02:27:10.710
<v Speaker 3>That's real.</v>

6040
02:27:10.710 --> 02:27:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6041
02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:14.050
<v Speaker 3>But that's not what you're seeing when you see planes fly overhead and you see</v>

6042
02:27:14.051 --> 02:27:15.970
<v Speaker 3>those clouds that form behind the planes,</v>

6043
02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.130
<v Speaker 3>that is a reaction between the jet engines,</v>

6044
02:27:18.250 --> 02:27:19.720
<v Speaker 3>the condensation in the atmosphere,</v>

6045
02:27:19.721 --> 02:27:20.680
<v Speaker 3>the heat of the jet engine.</v>

6046
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:22.930
<v Speaker 3>And that was never sold on it for a long time.</v>

6047
02:27:22.931 --> 02:27:24.370
<v Speaker 3>I was never sold on that at all.</v>

6048
02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:25.233
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

6049
02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:25.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6050
02:27:25.450 --> 02:27:26.140
<v Speaker 3>I was never,</v>

6051
02:27:26.140 --> 02:27:26.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6052
02:27:26.561 --> 02:27:27.160
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

6053
02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:29.200
<v Speaker 3>the nine 11 conspiracies and stuff like that.</v>

6054
02:27:29.201 --> 02:27:33.190
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that I've noticed about that is you can see the detonations going</v>

6055
02:27:33.191 --> 02:27:34.860
<v Speaker 3>off on building seven when it never got,</v>

6056
02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:39.460
<v Speaker 3>you don't see detonations when you see soft floors collapsing and the pressure</v>

6057
02:27:39.490 --> 02:27:40.840
<v Speaker 3>of these floors collapsing,</v>

6058
02:27:40.841 --> 02:27:42.550
<v Speaker 3>causing these windows to blow out,</v>

6059
02:27:42.570 --> 02:27:43.030
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

6060
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:45.730
<v Speaker 3>This is just what would happen if something was paying scribe to it,</v>

6061
02:27:45.731 --> 02:27:46.540
<v Speaker 3>is what I'm saying.</v>

6062
02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:47.373
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you're saying.</v>

6063
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:48.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't subscribe to it either.</v>

6064
02:27:48.940 --> 02:27:49.773
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6065
02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:55.030
<v Speaker 3>who knows what the fuck happened with all the shit behind the scenes.</v>

6066
02:27:55.150 --> 02:27:57.670
<v Speaker 3>But what we do know is that a bunch of people capitalize on that,</v>

6067
02:27:57.671 --> 02:27:58.980
<v Speaker 3>which makes it look like conspiracy.</v>

6068
02:27:58.990 --> 02:28:02.270
<v Speaker 3>All the intelligence reports that came out before that happened was that the</v>

6069
02:28:02.350 --> 02:28:05.660
<v Speaker 3>terrorist planned on using planes as missiles to take down building.</v>

6070
02:28:05.950 --> 02:28:08.350
<v Speaker 3>We knew that at least that's where I stopped.</v>

6071
02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:11.710
<v Speaker 3>I lean much more towards incompetence than I do.</v>

6072
02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:12.830
<v Speaker 3>Massive conspiracy.</v>

6073
02:28:12.831 --> 02:28:13.664
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of Barney fife,</v>

6074
02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:14.553
<v Speaker 3>keystone cops.</v>

6075
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:16.023
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

6076
02:28:16.390 --> 02:28:17.260
<v Speaker 3>But who knows.</v>

6077
02:28:17.610 --> 02:28:17.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6078
02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:20.110
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to talk to you about marathons,</v>

6079
02:28:20.230 --> 02:28:21.380
<v Speaker 3>about ultra marathons.</v>

6080
02:28:21.381 --> 02:28:21.831
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>

6081
02:28:21.831 --> 02:28:22.010
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

6082
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:22.830
<v Speaker 1>got into,</v>

6083
02:28:22.830 --> 02:28:22.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6084
02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:24.320
<v Speaker 1>when did you start getting into this?</v>

6085
02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:26.360
<v Speaker 1>It was a couple of years ago,</v>

6086
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:27.680
<v Speaker 1>John Byrne,</v>

6087
02:28:27.681 --> 02:28:32.360
<v Speaker 1>who is a professor at a college in my hometown and he and his family had taken</v>

6088
02:28:32.361 --> 02:28:35.570
<v Speaker 1>martial arts from me for years and he one day walked up to me,</v>

6089
02:28:35.571 --> 02:28:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 2012 or earlier,</v>

6090
02:28:40.010 --> 02:28:40.611
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

6091
02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:40.851
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

6092
02:28:40.851 --> 02:28:41.061
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

6093
02:28:41.061 --> 02:28:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank you for all the confidence you've given me.</v>

6094
02:28:43.310 --> 02:28:44.420
<v Speaker 1>And he was an amazing guy,</v>

6095
02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:45.141
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

6096
02:28:45.141 --> 02:28:47.510
<v Speaker 1>very smart guy and a great athlete,</v>

6097
02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:49.250
<v Speaker 1>great basketball player.</v>

6098
02:28:49.251 --> 02:28:51.320
<v Speaker 1>The guys now 53 years old,</v>

6099
02:28:51.321 --> 02:28:52.154
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

6100
02:28:52.310 --> 02:28:53.270
<v Speaker 1>and never gets hurt.</v>

6101
02:28:53.330 --> 02:28:56.030
<v Speaker 1>He can do anything he wants and he does not get hurt.</v>

6102
02:28:56.031 --> 02:28:57.620
<v Speaker 1>He's just a genetic freak,</v>

6103
02:28:57.621 --> 02:28:58.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6104
02:28:58.400 --> 02:28:59.270
<v Speaker 1>But he comes to me and he goes,</v>

6105
02:28:59.271 --> 02:29:00.440
<v Speaker 1>thank you for giving me the confidence.</v>

6106
02:29:00.441 --> 02:29:01.520
<v Speaker 1>I love the martial arts training,</v>

6107
02:29:01.521 --> 02:29:02.570
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to try something new.</v>

6108
02:29:02.571 --> 02:29:02.871
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

6109
02:29:02.871 --> 02:29:03.380
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to try?</v>

6110
02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:03.651
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

6111
02:29:03.651 --> 02:29:05.000
<v Speaker 1>this thing called the Leadville 100.</v>

6112
02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:06.493
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

6113
02:29:06.740 --> 02:29:07.640
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is that?</v>

6114
02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:08.451
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

6115
02:29:08.451 --> 02:29:08.661
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6116
02:29:08.661 --> 02:29:09.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a high altitude,</v>

6117
02:29:09.531 --> 02:29:11.360
<v Speaker 1>a hundred mile race through the Colorado Rockies.</v>

6118
02:29:11.361 --> 02:29:11.661
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

6119
02:29:11.661 --> 02:29:13.100
<v Speaker 1>how many days is this supposed to take?</v>

6120
02:29:13.101 --> 02:29:13.371
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

6121
02:29:13.371 --> 02:29:13.641
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

6122
02:29:13.641 --> 02:29:14.780
<v Speaker 1>you do it all at once.</v>

6123
02:29:16.100 --> 02:29:19.080
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do a hundred miles without basically stopped.</v>

6124
02:29:19.081 --> 02:29:19.371
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

6125
02:29:19.371 --> 02:29:19.551
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6126
02:29:19.551 --> 02:29:20.540
<v Speaker 1>he goes about every 10 miles,</v>

6127
02:29:20.541 --> 02:29:22.640
<v Speaker 1>you get new food and fluids and you just keep going.</v>

6128
02:29:23.550 --> 02:29:23.870
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

6129
02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:24.320
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

6130
02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:24.831
<v Speaker 1>Go do it,</v>

6131
02:29:24.831 --> 02:29:25.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6132
02:29:25.250 --> 02:29:26.240
<v Speaker 1>And he went and he finished.</v>

6133
02:29:26.390 --> 02:29:27.920
<v Speaker 1>He barely barely made the cutoff,</v>

6134
02:29:27.921 --> 02:29:29.000
<v Speaker 1>which is 30 hours.</v>

6135
02:29:29.090 --> 02:29:30.110
<v Speaker 1>You have to do it right.</v>

6136
02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:31.760
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>

6137
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:33.200
<v Speaker 1>this is really cool.</v>

6138
02:29:33.390 --> 02:29:36.350
<v Speaker 1>And it was a couple of years ago where he sent me a message and he goes,</v>

6139
02:29:36.351 --> 02:29:37.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm training for Leadville again.</v>

6140
02:29:38.210 --> 02:29:39.043
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

6141
02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:41.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a good idea for me to jump in.</v>

6142
02:29:41.630 --> 02:29:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I want to do something extreme.</v>

6143
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:46.280
<v Speaker 1>And since I quit fighting,</v>

6144
02:29:46.310 --> 02:29:48.890
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't ever find that was just that void in my life,</v>

6145
02:29:48.891 --> 02:29:49.430
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

6146
02:29:49.430 --> 02:29:50.930
<v Speaker 1>And my health was deteriorating.</v>

6147
02:29:50.931 --> 02:29:52.790
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't figure out how to get back in shape because,</v>

6148
02:29:53.420 --> 02:29:53.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6149
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I was in pain constantly.</v>

6150
02:29:55.131 --> 02:29:55.821
<v Speaker 1>I had asthma,</v>

6151
02:29:55.821 --> 02:29:56.571
<v Speaker 1>all this other stuff.</v>

6152
02:29:56.571 --> 02:29:57.860
<v Speaker 1>I found out that that was gluten,</v>

6153
02:29:58.050 --> 02:29:59.000
<v Speaker 1>the gluten problem.</v>

6154
02:29:59.540 --> 02:29:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6155
02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:01.460
<v Speaker 1>And I thought before that I thought,</v>

6156
02:30:01.461 --> 02:30:04.520
<v Speaker 1>if somebody says I'm gluten sensitive or I have allergy to gluten,</v>

6157
02:30:04.521 --> 02:30:04.701
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

6158
02:30:04.701 --> 02:30:05.490
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

6159
02:30:05.490 --> 02:30:06.323
<v Speaker 1>What is gluten?</v>

6160
02:30:06.440 --> 02:30:07.273
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6161
02:30:07.520 --> 02:30:09.590
<v Speaker 1>But I was running into so many physical problems.</v>

6162
02:30:09.591 --> 02:30:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I started training with these guys and I'd be crippled for two,</v>

6163
02:30:12.021 --> 02:30:12.531
<v Speaker 1>three days.</v>

6164
02:30:12.531 --> 02:30:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I'd be in so much pain that I couldn't do anything.</v>

6165
02:30:14.930 --> 02:30:17.360
<v Speaker 1>And then my buddy goes and I was getting ready to eat,</v>

6166
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:18.840
<v Speaker 1>start eating oxy cottons.</v>

6167
02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:19.461
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

6168
02:30:19.461 --> 02:30:19.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6169
02:30:19.731 --> 02:30:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I could survive on Motrin,</v>

6170
02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:21.913
<v Speaker 1>all the pain,</v>

6171
02:30:22.250 --> 02:30:22.911
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

6172
02:30:22.911 --> 02:30:24.800
<v Speaker 1>But I got to the point where I flying.</v>

6173
02:30:25.160 --> 02:30:28.700
<v Speaker 1>I'd walked five gates in the airport and have to stop and sit down.</v>

6174
02:30:28.701 --> 02:30:29.540
<v Speaker 1>I was in so much pain.</v>

6175
02:30:29.570 --> 02:30:30.860
<v Speaker 1>My arthritis was just horrible.</v>

6176
02:30:30.861 --> 02:30:31.970
<v Speaker 1>I'd be soaked in sweat,</v>

6177
02:30:32.390 --> 02:30:32.901
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

6178
02:30:32.901 --> 02:30:35.570
<v Speaker 1>So I had all these problems and I figured if I train with these guys,</v>

6179
02:30:35.571 --> 02:30:36.590
<v Speaker 1>it'll bring me out of this,</v>

6180
02:30:37.130 --> 02:30:38.840
<v Speaker 1>this point in life,</v>

6181
02:30:39.260 --> 02:30:40.340
<v Speaker 1>and it will change my life.</v>

6182
02:30:40.341 --> 02:30:41.151
<v Speaker 1>And I'll get back to the,</v>

6183
02:30:41.151 --> 02:30:41.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6184
02:30:41.451 --> 02:30:44.480
<v Speaker 1>pat mental chip of the old while I was falling apart.</v>

6185
02:30:44.481 --> 02:30:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Worse because of the intensity of the training.</v>

6186
02:30:47.210 --> 02:30:48.650
<v Speaker 1>So my buddy did blood tests on me.</v>

6187
02:30:48.651 --> 02:30:49.484
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

6188
02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:51.320
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be dead in three years from a heart attack.</v>

6189
02:30:51.321 --> 02:30:52.610
<v Speaker 1>There's so much inflammation in your body.</v>

6190
02:30:52.611 --> 02:30:53.990
<v Speaker 1>If you don't stop eating gluten,</v>

6191
02:30:54.020 --> 02:30:54.231
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

6192
02:30:54.231 --> 02:30:55.100
<v Speaker 1>what the Hell is gluten?</v>

6193
02:30:55.101 --> 02:30:55.311
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

6194
02:30:55.311 --> 02:30:55.911
<v Speaker 1>wheat and soy.</v>

6195
02:30:55.911 --> 02:30:57.470
<v Speaker 1>You have to stop eating where you're dead.</v>

6196
02:30:57.490 --> 02:30:58.980
<v Speaker 1>He swings gluten.</v>

6197
02:30:59.290 --> 02:31:00.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6198
02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:01.100
<v Speaker 1>wheat and soy.</v>

6199
02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:02.300
<v Speaker 1>So it's all about how,</v>

6200
02:31:02.301 --> 02:31:02.750
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

6201
02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:04.670
<v Speaker 1>I thought it's all modified grains.</v>

6202
02:31:04.920 --> 02:31:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Soy.</v>

6203
02:31:05.500 --> 02:31:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Soy has been modified,</v>

6204
02:31:06.531 --> 02:31:09.560
<v Speaker 1>like black beans have been modified for a certain amount of time.</v>

6205
02:31:09.561 --> 02:31:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Your body doesn't digest black.</v>

6206
02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Black beans really like a waste of time to eat.</v>

6207
02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:13.701
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

6208
02:31:13.701 --> 02:31:14.271
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

6209
02:31:14.271 --> 02:31:17.210
<v Speaker 1>the wheat and the soy is what was causing the inflammation along with the</v>

6210
02:31:17.211 --> 02:31:19.770
<v Speaker 1>spraying that goes on with wheat and soy fields.</v>

6211
02:31:19.771 --> 02:31:20.550
<v Speaker 1>It's really bad,</v>

6212
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:20.761
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6213
02:31:20.761 --> 02:31:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6214
02:31:21.450 --> 02:31:22.283
<v Speaker 1>So anyway.</v>

6215
02:31:22.810 --> 02:31:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6216
02:31:23.500 --> 02:31:24.091
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>

6217
02:31:24.091 --> 02:31:24.541
<v Speaker 1>Bad stuff.</v>

6218
02:31:24.541 --> 02:31:25.374
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

6219
02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:27.240
<v Speaker 1>he said you'll be dead in three years from a heart attack.</v>

6220
02:31:27.241 --> 02:31:28.350
<v Speaker 1>There's so much inflammation.</v>

6221
02:31:28.830 --> 02:31:29.581
<v Speaker 1>You have asthma,</v>

6222
02:31:29.581 --> 02:31:30.900
<v Speaker 1>you have three forms of arthritis,</v>

6223
02:31:30.901 --> 02:31:32.070
<v Speaker 1>your digestion system,</v>

6224
02:31:32.080 --> 02:31:33.810
<v Speaker 1>your digestive system is destroyed.</v>

6225
02:31:33.811 --> 02:31:33.991
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

6226
02:31:33.991 --> 02:31:34.950
<v Speaker 1>how's your temper been lately?</v>

6227
02:31:34.951 --> 02:31:35.161
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

6228
02:31:35.161 --> 02:31:35.701
<v Speaker 1>not real good.</v>

6229
02:31:35.701 --> 02:31:35.941
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

6230
02:31:35.941 --> 02:31:37.230
<v Speaker 1>your brain's getting destroyed.</v>

6231
02:31:37.860 --> 02:31:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Your thinking process is screwed up because the chemicals that your stomach is</v>

6232
02:31:41.281 --> 02:31:43.140
<v Speaker 1>given off is affecting the way you think.</v>

6233
02:31:43.140 --> 02:31:44.940
<v Speaker 1>It's your second stomach or your second brain.</v>

6234
02:31:44.941 --> 02:31:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6235
02:31:45.630 --> 02:31:45.961
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

6236
02:31:45.961 --> 02:31:46.950
<v Speaker 1>so you have to understand that.</v>

6237
02:31:46.951 --> 02:31:48.150
<v Speaker 1>So I quit cold Turkey,</v>

6238
02:31:48.151 --> 02:31:48.984
<v Speaker 1>stopped eating.</v>

6239
02:31:49.310 --> 02:31:51.780
<v Speaker 1>It took about a week before my arthritis subsided.</v>

6240
02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Started to go away.</v>

6241
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:57.480
<v Speaker 1>I went from running three mile runs and feeling miserable for three days to 10</v>

6242
02:31:57.481 --> 02:31:57.991
<v Speaker 1>months later.</v>

6243
02:31:57.991 --> 02:32:01.170
<v Speaker 1>I did a 75 mile run in 10 in 10 months though from,</v>

6244
02:32:01.260 --> 02:32:04.380
<v Speaker 1>from not eating that garbage it was it a race,</v>

6245
02:32:04.381 --> 02:32:05.370
<v Speaker 1>the 75 mile run.</v>

6246
02:32:05.480 --> 02:32:06.780
<v Speaker 1>It was actually a training run.</v>

6247
02:32:06.781 --> 02:32:08.490
<v Speaker 1>It was a training run with the guys and that we,</v>

6248
02:32:08.491 --> 02:32:08.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6249
02:32:08.730 --> 02:32:08.970
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

6250
02:32:08.970 --> 02:32:11.130
<v Speaker 1>they worked me up from um,</v>

6251
02:32:11.500 --> 02:32:11.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6252
02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:12.391
<v Speaker 1>three mile run,</v>

6253
02:32:12.391 --> 02:32:13.290
<v Speaker 1>10 mile run,</v>

6254
02:32:13.291 --> 02:32:13.891
<v Speaker 1>12 miles,</v>

6255
02:32:13.891 --> 02:32:14.970
<v Speaker 1>1518,</v>

6256
02:32:14.971 --> 02:32:15.790
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

6257
02:32:15.790 --> 02:32:16.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6258
02:32:16.050 --> 02:32:18.300
<v Speaker 1>drop back down to a 10 mile run on the weekend.</v>

6259
02:32:18.301 --> 02:32:19.860
<v Speaker 1>They'd always do the long runs on the weekends.</v>

6260
02:32:19.861 --> 02:32:22.380
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times I was doing these runs on no sleep because I'd done a</v>

6261
02:32:22.381 --> 02:32:23.250
<v Speaker 1>broadcast Friday night,</v>

6262
02:32:23.910 --> 02:32:24.360
<v Speaker 1>get home,</v>

6263
02:32:24.360 --> 02:32:26.580
<v Speaker 1>get home the next day on Saturday,</v>

6264
02:32:26.581 --> 02:32:26.791
<v Speaker 1>half,</v>

6265
02:32:26.791 --> 02:32:27.780
<v Speaker 1>no sleep because you know,</v>

6266
02:32:27.781 --> 02:32:30.390
<v Speaker 1>you can finish late and you got to fly home first thing in the morning is what I</v>

6267
02:32:30.391 --> 02:32:31.224
<v Speaker 1>always did,</v>

6268
02:32:31.410 --> 02:32:36.060
<v Speaker 1>operating on no sleep and then start and we'd just 30 mile run 35 45 50 and then</v>

6269
02:32:36.061 --> 02:32:38.040
<v Speaker 1>a 75 mile run along with the stuff,</v>

6270
02:32:38.041 --> 02:32:40.680
<v Speaker 1>training during the week that a lot of it I was doing on the road too.</v>

6271
02:32:41.220 --> 02:32:43.920
<v Speaker 1>And it's just an amazing group.</v>

6272
02:32:43.950 --> 02:32:46.650
<v Speaker 1>It's probably the coolest group of people I've been around.</v>

6273
02:32:46.651 --> 02:32:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And David Clark,</v>

6274
02:32:47.761 --> 02:32:52.761
<v Speaker 1>who is a guy that served as a role model for me just reading his book,</v>

6275
02:32:53.580 --> 02:32:54.890
<v Speaker 1>which is called out there,</v>

6276
02:32:55.860 --> 02:32:59.700
<v Speaker 1>ultra recovery it guy that was 320 pound alcoholic who changed his life one day</v>

6277
02:32:59.701 --> 02:33:02.550
<v Speaker 1>and decided to become a bad ass ultra runner.</v>

6278
02:33:02.850 --> 02:33:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6279
02:33:03.630 --> 02:33:04.170
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

6280
02:33:04.170 --> 02:33:05.280
<v Speaker 1>being around those people,</v>

6281
02:33:05.281 --> 02:33:05.630
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

6282
02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:06.630
<v Speaker 1>they don't show pain.</v>

6283
02:33:06.870 --> 02:33:07.560
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

6284
02:33:07.560 --> 02:33:09.900
<v Speaker 1>they just don't show pain even when they're in misery.</v>

6285
02:33:10.890 --> 02:33:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6286
02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:11.641
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6287
02:33:11.641 --> 02:33:12.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird mindset.</v>

6288
02:33:12.900 --> 02:33:13.280
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

6289
02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:18.280
<v Speaker 1>it's so much different than MMA where 25 minutes of misery and exhausting fight</v>

6290
02:33:19.080 --> 02:33:19.913
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

6291
02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Now that I've gone through some of this stuff,</v>

6292
02:33:21.991 --> 02:33:22.200
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6293
02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:23.033
<v Speaker 1>it's a joke.</v>

6294
02:33:23.070 --> 02:33:27.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a complete joke because when you're out there running 75 miles,</v>

6295
02:33:27.001 --> 02:33:27.481
<v Speaker 1>50 miles,</v>

6296
02:33:27.481 --> 02:33:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I ran 50 miles in 97 degree heat with the same percentage of humidity on a</v>

6297
02:33:32.221 --> 02:33:33.900
<v Speaker 1>blacktop country road in Iowa.</v>

6298
02:33:34.380 --> 02:33:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Getting scorched went through probably four hours of heatstroke.</v>

6299
02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:40.320
<v Speaker 1>My brain was getting cooked.</v>

6300
02:33:40.380 --> 02:33:40.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6301
02:33:40.651 --> 02:33:41.670
<v Speaker 1>I literally felt like I was,</v>

6302
02:33:42.210 --> 02:33:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I could die at any time and these guys are laughing at me.</v>

6303
02:33:47.010 --> 02:33:47.843
<v Speaker 1>They're laughing.</v>

6304
02:33:47.910 --> 02:33:52.910
<v Speaker 1>They had me in a field at mile 30 a farmer's yard hosing me down with cold water</v>

6305
02:33:53.461 --> 02:33:57.270
<v Speaker 1>from the farmer's house just to get my body temperature down so I could get</v>

6306
02:33:57.271 --> 02:33:57.930
<v Speaker 1>going again.</v>

6307
02:33:57.930 --> 02:33:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6308
02:33:58.260 --> 02:33:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

6309
02:33:58.740 --> 02:34:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Just crazy stuff like that.</v>

6310
02:34:00.031 --> 02:34:00.151
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

6311
02:34:00.151 --> 02:34:01.450
<v Speaker 1>they're just hardcore to,</v>

6312
02:34:01.460 --> 02:34:05.160
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing group of people and I encourage people to work their way up,</v>

6313
02:34:05.161 --> 02:34:07.430
<v Speaker 1>try and find a running group and try it because it's,</v>

6314
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:08.280
<v Speaker 1>it's cool shit.</v>

6315
02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:10.890
<v Speaker 1>How often you do it now I backed off of late.</v>

6316
02:34:10.891 --> 02:34:11.724
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing more,</v>

6317
02:34:11.970 --> 02:34:13.740
<v Speaker 1>kind of getting back into grappling a little bit,</v>

6318
02:34:13.770 --> 02:34:15.150
<v Speaker 1>doing a little bit of kickboxing,</v>

6319
02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:16.620
<v Speaker 1>grappling even with your neck.</v>

6320
02:34:16.660 --> 02:34:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I tell people,</v>

6321
02:34:17.591 --> 02:34:17.831
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

6322
02:34:17.831 --> 02:34:18.700
<v Speaker 1>don't go for the gold.</v>

6323
02:34:19.890 --> 02:34:20.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6324
02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:24.010
<v Speaker 1>and I had to tell the grant and there's a lot of good grapplers at the place.</v>

6325
02:34:24.011 --> 02:34:25.570
<v Speaker 1>I go to a summit,</v>

6326
02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:27.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a wrestling and Jujitsu facility.</v>

6327
02:34:27.341 --> 02:34:28.141
<v Speaker 1>Crossfits in there,</v>

6328
02:34:28.141 --> 02:34:28.974
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of other stuff.</v>

6329
02:34:29.290 --> 02:34:32.230
<v Speaker 1>But some of the guys that I used to train or the senior guys down there and</v>

6330
02:34:32.231 --> 02:34:32.380
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

6331
02:34:32.380 --> 02:34:33.880
<v Speaker 1>there's some really technical guys,</v>

6332
02:34:33.881 --> 02:34:34.750
<v Speaker 1>some 10th planet guides.</v>

6333
02:34:34.751 --> 02:34:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Actually Joel Loughlin,</v>

6334
02:34:36.450 --> 02:34:36.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6335
02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:37.420
<v Speaker 1>follows,</v>

6336
02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:39.130
<v Speaker 1>follows that system quite a bit.</v>

6337
02:34:39.131 --> 02:34:39.461
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>

6338
02:34:39.461 --> 02:34:41.230
<v Speaker 1>he's former special forces guy.</v>

6339
02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:42.800
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

6340
02:34:42.850 --> 02:34:43.990
<v Speaker 1>I just said to everybody,</v>

6341
02:34:44.020 --> 02:34:45.460
<v Speaker 1>the first few times I went down there I go,</v>

6342
02:34:45.461 --> 02:34:45.970
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

6343
02:34:45.970 --> 02:34:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I have no desire to be a world champion again.</v>

6344
02:34:47.891 --> 02:34:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I've been paralyzed twice from the neck down.</v>

6345
02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I have no desire to get into frigging brawls with any of you.</v>

6346
02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:54.461
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

6347
02:34:54.461 --> 02:34:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to get back in shape and just grapple and kind of fun again.</v>

6348
02:34:57.280 --> 02:34:57.730
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

6349
02:34:57.730 --> 02:34:58.563
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

6350
02:34:58.570 --> 02:34:59.440
<v Speaker 1>let's understand that.</v>

6351
02:34:59.441 --> 02:35:00.310
<v Speaker 1>First and foremost,</v>

6352
02:35:00.311 --> 02:35:02.920
<v Speaker 1>if you go for crazy submissions on my neck,</v>

6353
02:35:02.921 --> 02:35:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to like you a whole lot.</v>

6354
02:35:05.260 --> 02:35:06.093
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

6355
02:35:06.370 --> 02:35:06.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6356
02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:08.080
<v Speaker 1>so I'm doing a lot of that.</v>

6357
02:35:08.170 --> 02:35:11.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm slowly getting kind of back into the mindset of ramping back up with the</v>

6358
02:35:11.261 --> 02:35:12.800
<v Speaker 1>running and stuff like that.</v>

6359
02:35:12.801 --> 02:35:15.580
<v Speaker 1>And my brother who's 58 who never ran,</v>

6360
02:35:15.581 --> 02:35:17.260
<v Speaker 1>he did Leadville last year.</v>

6361
02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:18.273
<v Speaker 1>Was it last year?</v>

6362
02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6363
02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6364
02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:20.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6365
02:35:20.591 --> 02:35:23.920
<v Speaker 1>that's a guy that never ran and most people take their lifetime to be able to do</v>

6366
02:35:23.921 --> 02:35:24.530
<v Speaker 1>a marathon.</v>

6367
02:35:24.530 --> 02:35:26.200
<v Speaker 1>He did 50 miles at Leadville,</v>

6368
02:35:26.620 --> 02:35:28.300
<v Speaker 1>missed the cutoff at 50 miles,</v>

6369
02:35:28.690 --> 02:35:32.380
<v Speaker 1>but he's 58 years old and never ran before and just he was in love with it.</v>

6370
02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:33.550
<v Speaker 1>He fell in love with it.</v>

6371
02:35:33.551 --> 02:35:34.420
<v Speaker 1>He's in the mountains,</v>

6372
02:35:34.860 --> 02:35:35.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6373
02:35:35.081 --> 02:35:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I already live my sports streams.</v>

6374
02:35:36.311 --> 02:35:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

6375
02:35:36.700 --> 02:35:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I already won a world title.</v>

6376
02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I've done some cool shit.</v>

6377
02:35:39.490 --> 02:35:40.840
<v Speaker 1>So to me running that,</v>

6378
02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:42.160
<v Speaker 1>when I saw the course and went,</v>

6379
02:35:42.161 --> 02:35:42.760
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

6380
02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:43.750
<v Speaker 1>this is intimidating,</v>

6381
02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:45.250
<v Speaker 1>this is to look at a mountain and no,</v>

6382
02:35:45.251 --> 02:35:49.330
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go over it at the 40 to 50 mile mark and then 50 to 60 going back.</v>

6383
02:35:49.500 --> 02:35:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's some scary shit.</v>

6384
02:35:50.621 --> 02:35:51.454
<v Speaker 1>It's intimidated.</v>

6385
02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:53.500
<v Speaker 1>My brother was totally the opposite mindset.</v>

6386
02:35:53.501 --> 02:35:54.334
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

6387
02:35:54.970 --> 02:35:56.440
<v Speaker 1>this is the coolest Shit I've ever done in my life.</v>

6388
02:35:56.470 --> 02:35:59.800
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't bomb and down that mountain was the coolest thing I've ever done in</v>

6389
02:35:59.801 --> 02:36:00.191
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

6390
02:36:00.191 --> 02:36:00.911
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing.</v>

6391
02:36:00.911 --> 02:36:01.481
<v Speaker 1>And I just went,</v>

6392
02:36:01.481 --> 02:36:03.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the way the mind supposed to work for stuff like this.</v>

6393
02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:04.750
<v Speaker 1>He got it.</v>

6394
02:36:04.750 --> 02:36:05.583
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

6395
02:36:05.690 --> 02:36:08.110
<v Speaker 1>So well it is a lot of it is how you approach things.</v>

6396
02:36:08.111 --> 02:36:08.321
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6397
02:36:08.321 --> 02:36:09.510
<v Speaker 1>And how you approach challenges.</v>

6398
02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Like some people love the idea of something being very difficult.</v>

6399
02:36:13.331 --> 02:36:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Like what a struggle.</v>

6400
02:36:14.580 --> 02:36:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe how tough that was.</v>

6401
02:36:15.941 --> 02:36:16.511
<v Speaker 1>You get out of it,</v>

6402
02:36:16.511 --> 02:36:17.500
<v Speaker 1>you feel exhilarated.</v>

6403
02:36:17.710 --> 02:36:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Whereas other people they look at it like,</v>

6404
02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:20.110
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

6405
02:36:20.111 --> 02:36:25.111
<v Speaker 1>I need a couch and a beer and a sandwich and a good TV show about fucking,</v>

6406
02:36:26.290 --> 02:36:26.790
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

6407
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6408
02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

6409
02:36:27.910 --> 02:36:28.601
<v Speaker 1>But I did,</v>

6410
02:36:28.601 --> 02:36:33.220
<v Speaker 1>so I did Leadville a couple of years back and John Byrne and I went out two</v>

6411
02:36:33.221 --> 02:36:35.320
<v Speaker 1>weeks early and I had to leave from Colorado,</v>

6412
02:36:35.321 --> 02:36:38.680
<v Speaker 1>fly back to providence to do a broadcast and then fly back.</v>

6413
02:36:38.681 --> 02:36:40.540
<v Speaker 1>He picked me up at the airport and we went back up.</v>

6414
02:36:41.710 --> 02:36:43.360
<v Speaker 1>But while I was with him for the first couple of days,</v>

6415
02:36:43.361 --> 02:36:44.800
<v Speaker 1>we went out up Mount Elbert,</v>

6416
02:36:44.801 --> 02:36:46.270
<v Speaker 1>which is the tallest mountain in Colorado.</v>

6417
02:36:46.271 --> 02:36:47.500
<v Speaker 1>And I felt the altitude,</v>

6418
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:49.750
<v Speaker 1>I felt the alligator 14 five or whatever it was.</v>

6419
02:36:49.751 --> 02:36:50.111
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

6420
02:36:50.111 --> 02:36:51.190
<v Speaker 1>it was painful on the way up.</v>

6421
02:36:51.790 --> 02:36:54.220
<v Speaker 1>And then we got caught on a storm on the top of the mountain,</v>

6422
02:36:54.221 --> 02:36:54.911
<v Speaker 1>a bad storm,</v>

6423
02:36:54.911 --> 02:36:58.780
<v Speaker 1>hail downpour and lightening hitting everywhere all over the mountain.</v>

6424
02:36:58.780 --> 02:37:03.760
<v Speaker 1>We had the bomb down this mountain as fast as we could and I trashed my quads.</v>

6425
02:37:03.820 --> 02:37:04.031
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6426
02:37:04.031 --> 02:37:07.000
<v Speaker 1>And we're real close to the actual race at that point,</v>

6427
02:37:07.001 --> 02:37:07.151
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

6428
02:37:07.151 --> 02:37:08.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like a week and a half away.</v>

6429
02:37:09.130 --> 02:37:10.290
<v Speaker 1>And so then I got on a plane,</v>

6430
02:37:10.300 --> 02:37:11.200
<v Speaker 1>flew to Providence,</v>

6431
02:37:11.890 --> 02:37:12.700
<v Speaker 1>and I was panicking.</v>

6432
02:37:12.700 --> 02:37:13.091
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

6433
02:37:13.091 --> 02:37:15.710
<v Speaker 1>this is some serious shit I'm about to do.</v>

6434
02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6435
02:37:16.430 --> 02:37:17.630
<v Speaker 1>And I started sweating.</v>

6436
02:37:17.660 --> 02:37:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I'd never had anxiety attacks before in my life.</v>

6437
02:37:19.611 --> 02:37:19.941
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

6438
02:37:19.941 --> 02:37:21.350
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you thinking,</v>

6439
02:37:21.351 --> 02:37:22.040
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

6440
02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:23.330
<v Speaker 1>this is some crazy stuff.</v>

6441
02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:24.890
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

6442
02:37:25.310 --> 02:37:27.830
<v Speaker 1>we were getting ready to go live and Michael Chavela looks at me and he goes,</v>

6443
02:37:27.831 --> 02:37:29.240
<v Speaker 1>why are you soaked?</v>

6444
02:37:30.260 --> 02:37:30.621
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

6445
02:37:30.621 --> 02:37:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking freaking out,</v>

6446
02:37:31.950 --> 02:37:32.200
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

6447
02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I got to fly back to Colorado.</v>

6448
02:37:33.501 --> 02:37:34.101
<v Speaker 1>Go do this race.</v>

6449
02:37:34.101 --> 02:37:35.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm panicking.</v>

6450
02:37:35.001 --> 02:37:35.834
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6451
02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:39.200
<v Speaker 1>And I never thought I'd be afraid of anything but that the course is that</v>

6452
02:37:39.201 --> 02:37:39.800
<v Speaker 1>intimidating.</v>

6453
02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:40.633
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6454
02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:41.571
<v Speaker 1>So Michael Goes,</v>

6455
02:37:41.571 --> 02:37:42.050
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

6456
02:37:42.050 --> 02:37:42.681
<v Speaker 1>relax.</v>

6457
02:37:42.681 --> 02:37:43.221
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

6458
02:37:43.221 --> 02:37:44.090
<v Speaker 1>So we did the show,</v>

6459
02:37:44.091 --> 02:37:45.950
<v Speaker 1>everything I got back there and it,</v>

6460
02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:46.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6461
02:37:46.401 --> 02:37:47.780
<v Speaker 1>when you're out there in the mountains,</v>

6462
02:37:47.870 --> 02:37:49.400
<v Speaker 1>you start at four o'clock in the morning.</v>

6463
02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:50.880
<v Speaker 1>And these,</v>

6464
02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:51.471
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

6465
02:37:51.471 --> 02:37:52.490
<v Speaker 1>they're hardcore runners,</v>

6466
02:37:52.491 --> 02:37:52.750
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6467
02:37:52.750 --> 02:37:53.900
<v Speaker 1>They're hardcore bad assets.</v>

6468
02:37:53.901 --> 02:37:54.171
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

6469
02:37:54.171 --> 02:37:55.580
<v Speaker 1>You'd never,</v>

6470
02:37:55.900 --> 02:37:56.960
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at them on the street,</v>

6471
02:37:56.961 --> 02:37:57.141
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

6472
02:37:57.141 --> 02:37:59.090
<v Speaker 1>there's no way that person could run five miles.</v>

6473
02:37:59.540 --> 02:38:01.310
<v Speaker 1>And they're just smiling for a hundred miles.</v>

6474
02:38:01.311 --> 02:38:02.000
<v Speaker 1>They're just going,</v>

6475
02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:02.380
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

6476
02:38:02.380 --> 02:38:02.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6477
02:38:02.710 --> 02:38:03.560
<v Speaker 1>so Courtney,</v>

6478
02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:04.221
<v Speaker 1>Courtney doe,</v>

6479
02:38:04.221 --> 02:38:04.701
<v Speaker 1>Walter is,</v>

6480
02:38:04.701 --> 02:38:05.060
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

6481
02:38:05.060 --> 02:38:05.360
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

6482
02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I had her on and she wanted the Moab to 40 by how many hours she beat the 10</v>

6483
02:38:10.911 --> 02:38:12.470
<v Speaker 1>hours and 20 miles.</v>

6484
02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:14.000
<v Speaker 1>She beat the second place guy.</v>

6485
02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:14.960
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

6486
02:38:15.950 --> 02:38:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Were there people that thought she cheated to do that?</v>

6487
02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

6488
02:38:18.390 --> 02:38:19.223
<v Speaker 1>They newer.</v>

6489
02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew her.</v>

6490
02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:20.930
<v Speaker 1>She's an animal.</v>

6491
02:38:20.930 --> 02:38:21.130
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

6492
02:38:21.130 --> 02:38:22.910
<v Speaker 1>she won a race blind.</v>

6493
02:38:23.330 --> 02:38:26.690
<v Speaker 1>She was having some sort of retinal edema so she couldn't see anything but her</v>

6494
02:38:26.691 --> 02:38:29.240
<v Speaker 1>feet [inaudible] had to tell her where to go and all that sort of stuff.</v>

6495
02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:30.110
<v Speaker 1>She had a pacer.</v>

6496
02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:32.540
<v Speaker 1>She tripped and fell and cracked her head open.</v>

6497
02:38:32.541 --> 02:38:32.801
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

6498
02:38:32.801 --> 02:38:34.250
<v Speaker 1>she went through the finish line.</v>

6499
02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Bloody and blind.</v>

6500
02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:36.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the toughest stuff.</v>

6501
02:38:36.561 --> 02:38:38.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the toughest people you're ever going to meet.</v>

6502
02:38:38.390 --> 02:38:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6503
02:38:38.650 --> 02:38:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6504
02:38:38.870 --> 02:38:40.610
<v Speaker 1>If you met her completely unassuming,</v>

6505
02:38:40.670 --> 02:38:41.720
<v Speaker 1>thin woman,</v>

6506
02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:43.460
<v Speaker 1>real silly drinks,</v>

6507
02:38:43.461 --> 02:38:44.970
<v Speaker 1>beer and eat Nachos,</v>

6508
02:38:45.020 --> 02:38:47.510
<v Speaker 1>not on some kind of crazy die eats candy.</v>

6509
02:38:47.930 --> 02:38:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6510
02:38:48.350 --> 02:38:49.580
<v Speaker 1>She's real fun to hang out with.</v>

6511
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:50.720
<v Speaker 1>That's like very easy going.</v>

6512
02:38:50.750 --> 02:38:52.400
<v Speaker 1>That's like you meet Navy seals and you go,</v>

6513
02:38:52.401 --> 02:38:53.300
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to be tough.</v>

6514
02:38:53.301 --> 02:38:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

6515
02:38:53.570 --> 02:38:53.930
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

6516
02:38:53.930 --> 02:38:57.020
<v Speaker 1>But I watched navy seals fall apart last year when my brother was doing the</v>

6517
02:38:57.021 --> 02:38:57.530
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

6518
02:38:57.530 --> 02:38:58.700
<v Speaker 1>like just fall apart.</v>

6519
02:38:58.790 --> 02:38:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Just Whitley.</v>

6520
02:38:59.530 --> 02:38:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Yet.</v>

6521
02:38:59.870 --> 02:39:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

6522
02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:01.251
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6523
02:39:01.251 --> 02:39:03.410
<v Speaker 1>if you're not physically prepared to wow,</v>

6524
02:39:03.411 --> 02:39:03.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6525
02:39:03.661 --> 02:39:04.130
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

6526
02:39:04.130 --> 02:39:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I know that some of them did the 50 miler out there.</v>

6527
02:39:06.291 --> 02:39:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6528
02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:08.480
<v Speaker 1>So they were getting ready for it.</v>

6529
02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:09.870
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

6530
02:39:09.900 --> 02:39:10.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

6531
02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:14.160
<v Speaker 1>you get dehydrated at any point or caloric deficit or all this,</v>

6532
02:39:14.260 --> 02:39:17.450
<v Speaker 1>these different altitude problems that can come about all the other stuff,</v>

6533
02:39:17.451 --> 02:39:17.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6534
02:39:17.691 --> 02:39:17.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6535
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.823
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

6536
02:39:19.270 --> 02:39:19.581
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6537
02:39:19.581 --> 02:39:21.710
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a mental thing that,</v>

6538
02:39:21.740 --> 02:39:22.540
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

6539
02:39:22.540 --> 02:39:23.250
<v Speaker 1>it's wild.</v>

6540
02:39:23.250 --> 02:39:25.610
<v Speaker 1>So fighting is the way I look at it.</v>

6541
02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:28.250
<v Speaker 1>The best way I can explain to you as fighting is so fucking easy.</v>

6542
02:39:28.740 --> 02:39:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Finding the Harrison.</v>

6543
02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:29.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6544
02:39:29.991 --> 02:39:30.824
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6545
02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:31.941
<v Speaker 1>in reality,</v>

6546
02:39:31.941 --> 02:39:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was fighting like when I fought Palae when he was ranked second in the</v>

6547
02:39:35.421 --> 02:39:35.650
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

6548
02:39:35.650 --> 02:39:36.483
<v Speaker 1>I was ranked first.</v>

6549
02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:39.620
<v Speaker 1>I didn't train for six weeks for that fight cause I was crippled,</v>

6550
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:40.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6551
02:39:40.370 --> 02:39:40.911
<v Speaker 1>I was injured,</v>

6552
02:39:40.911 --> 02:39:41.361
<v Speaker 1>low back,</v>

6553
02:39:41.361 --> 02:39:41.901
<v Speaker 1>destroyed,</v>

6554
02:39:41.901 --> 02:39:42.441
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of stuff.</v>

6555
02:39:42.441 --> 02:39:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I had 12 shots as Aila came into my back to go out and fight.</v>

6556
02:39:45.260 --> 02:39:47.870
<v Speaker 1>He's crying and he was the number two guy in the world at the time and very</v>

6557
02:39:47.871 --> 02:39:48.261
<v Speaker 1>athletic,</v>

6558
02:39:48.261 --> 02:39:49.940
<v Speaker 1>a fucking killer at the time.</v>

6559
02:39:49.970 --> 02:39:51.290
<v Speaker 1>But he couldn't do shit to hurt me.</v>

6560
02:39:51.291 --> 02:39:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Even when I was crippled,</v>

6561
02:39:52.370 --> 02:39:55.190
<v Speaker 1>he fell back for a leg lock on me and I laughed at him and he was like,</v>

6562
02:39:55.191 --> 02:39:55.401
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6563
02:39:55.401 --> 02:39:56.080
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to work,</v>

6564
02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:57.560
<v Speaker 1>so let's get right.</v>

6565
02:39:57.770 --> 02:40:00.620
<v Speaker 1>But he was hanging on my head and I'm throwing up her cuts and body shots and</v>

6566
02:40:00.621 --> 02:40:01.251
<v Speaker 1>he's plumbing me.</v>

6567
02:40:01.251 --> 02:40:04.790
<v Speaker 1>He ran up my body with knees like that,</v>

6568
02:40:04.791 --> 02:40:05.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6569
02:40:05.001 --> 02:40:05.541
<v Speaker 1>just a freak.</v>

6570
02:40:05.541 --> 02:40:06.770
<v Speaker 1>But fighting is that easy.</v>

6571
02:40:06.771 --> 02:40:10.460
<v Speaker 1>It's that simple to me because you're trying to outwit now smarter than other</v>

6572
02:40:10.461 --> 02:40:11.090
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>

6573
02:40:11.090 --> 02:40:11.421
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6574
02:40:11.421 --> 02:40:12.254
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6575
02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:14.670
<v Speaker 1>When you're running for 50 miles,</v>

6576
02:40:14.671 --> 02:40:15.540
<v Speaker 1>75 miles,</v>

6577
02:40:15.541 --> 02:40:15.901
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

6578
02:40:15.901 --> 02:40:19.290
<v Speaker 1>a hundred miles you battling with yourself the entire time.</v>

6579
02:40:19.310 --> 02:40:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6580
02:40:19.770 --> 02:40:21.180
<v Speaker 1>That's where you get mind fucked.</v>

6581
02:40:21.220 --> 02:40:21.611
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

6582
02:40:21.611 --> 02:40:21.871
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

6583
02:40:21.871 --> 02:40:22.560
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

6584
02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:23.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the scary part about it.</v>

6585
02:40:24.030 --> 02:40:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Cause you gotta face yourself.</v>

6586
02:40:25.590 --> 02:40:26.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6587
02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:27.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6588
02:40:27.391 --> 02:40:28.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing.</v>

6589
02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:28.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6590
02:40:28.981 --> 02:40:29.261
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

6591
02:40:29.261 --> 02:40:29.970
<v Speaker 1>you're in.</v>

6592
02:40:29.970 --> 02:40:31.170
<v Speaker 1>You're in the middle of a fight,</v>

6593
02:40:31.171 --> 02:40:32.130
<v Speaker 1>especially a war.</v>

6594
02:40:32.130 --> 02:40:35.670
<v Speaker 1>You're in the moment you're throwing bombs and acting and reacting and just</v>

6595
02:40:35.671 --> 02:40:38.070
<v Speaker 1>doing it and dealing with it and toughen it up.</v>

6596
02:40:38.071 --> 02:40:39.120
<v Speaker 1>You take a minute break,</v>

6597
02:40:39.121 --> 02:40:39.841
<v Speaker 1>drink some water,</v>

6598
02:40:39.841 --> 02:40:41.610
<v Speaker 1>hop right back out again for five minutes.</v>

6599
02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Is it just a completely different animal?</v>

6600
02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:44.071
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6601
02:40:44.071 --> 02:40:46.260
<v Speaker 1>You do you miss the old days of no time limits.</v>

6602
02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:46.951
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6603
02:40:46.951 --> 02:40:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I had fun back in those days because I could go a hundred miles an hour in gas</v>

6604
02:40:50.131 --> 02:40:50.941
<v Speaker 1>people out and beat them.</v>

6605
02:40:50.941 --> 02:40:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

6606
02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:51.630
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

6607
02:40:51.630 --> 02:40:52.410
<v Speaker 1>With the conditioning.</v>

6608
02:40:52.410 --> 02:40:53.243
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed that.</v>

6609
02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:53.881
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

6610
02:40:53.881 --> 02:40:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I did enjoy that.</v>

6611
02:40:55.020 --> 02:40:55.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6612
02:40:56.280 --> 02:40:58.020
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

6613
02:40:58.021 --> 02:40:58.351
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

6614
02:40:58.351 --> 02:40:59.081
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is.</v>

6615
02:40:59.081 --> 02:40:59.914
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

6616
02:40:59.940 --> 02:41:03.810
<v Speaker 1>there were fights in tournaments that would go 45 minutes and just show you</v>

6617
02:41:03.811 --> 02:41:05.280
<v Speaker 1>can't cover that on TV.</v>

6618
02:41:05.340 --> 02:41:05.581
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

6619
02:41:05.581 --> 02:41:05.761
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

6620
02:41:05.761 --> 02:41:05.921
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

6621
02:41:05.921 --> 02:41:06.721
<v Speaker 1>We just can't keep,</v>

6622
02:41:06.721 --> 02:41:07.554
<v Speaker 1>he fought Dan.</v>

6623
02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Was that a no time limit?</v>

6624
02:41:09.310 --> 02:41:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Third argument,</v>

6625
02:41:10.371 --> 02:41:11.204
<v Speaker 1>that one round fight.</v>

6626
02:41:11.250 --> 02:41:11.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6627
02:41:11.461 --> 02:41:12.240
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

6628
02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:12.931
<v Speaker 1>So it's just,</v>

6629
02:41:12.931 --> 02:41:13.650
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is.</v>

6630
02:41:13.650 --> 02:41:14.280
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

6631
02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:16.080
<v Speaker 1>people would sit down and watch it live,</v>

6632
02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:18.450
<v Speaker 1>but they're not going to watch it on TV.</v>

6633
02:41:18.451 --> 02:41:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Even though you're going to pay for,</v>

6634
02:41:19.820 --> 02:41:21.210
<v Speaker 1>for you get bummed out.</v>

6635
02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:21.481
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6636
02:41:21.481 --> 02:41:23.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the best thing.</v>

6637
02:41:23.071 --> 02:41:24.480
<v Speaker 1>In terms of entertainment value.</v>

6638
02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:25.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6639
02:41:25.170 --> 02:41:25.740
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

6640
02:41:25.740 --> 02:41:26.071
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

6641
02:41:26.071 --> 02:41:26.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

6642
02:41:26.850 --> 02:41:27.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6643
02:41:27.061 --> 02:41:27.894
<v Speaker 1>the rounds,</v>

6644
02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:29.280
<v Speaker 1>the rules,</v>

6645
02:41:29.281 --> 02:41:30.150
<v Speaker 1>all that sort of stuff.</v>

6646
02:41:30.151 --> 02:41:33.780
<v Speaker 1>That the way you look at some girls in bikinis is in between rounds.</v>

6647
02:41:34.530 --> 02:41:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Walk around with the cards.</v>

6648
02:41:36.250 --> 02:41:36.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6649
02:41:36.510 --> 02:41:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I talked to John Perretti,</v>

6650
02:41:37.411 --> 02:41:39.780
<v Speaker 1>we had John Perretti on one of my podcasts actually.</v>

6651
02:41:39.781 --> 02:41:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6652
02:41:40.140 --> 02:41:40.973
<v Speaker 1>How's he doing?</v>

6653
02:41:41.020 --> 02:41:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I know he's got some health issues,</v>

6654
02:41:42.470 --> 02:41:42.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6655
02:41:42.860 --> 02:41:43.250

6657
02:41:43.501 --> 02:41:45.930
<v Speaker 1>I know he's got the MS and some other issues and stuff like that,</v>

6658
02:41:45.931 --> 02:41:46.470
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

6659
02:41:46.470 --> 02:41:47.303
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6662
02:41:48.180 --> 02:41:50.100
<v Speaker 1>he wants people to know that he's the guy that did that.</v>

6663
02:41:50.130 --> 02:41:50.600
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

6664
02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6665
02:41:51.210 --> 02:41:54.330
<v Speaker 1>He wants people to know I'm the guy that frigging created all that stuff.</v>

6666
02:41:54.750 --> 02:41:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6667
02:41:55.060 --> 02:41:58.540
<v Speaker 1>he was the matchmaker at the time when I first started working for the UFC in</v>

6668
02:41:58.541 --> 02:41:59.101

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6673

<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

6681

02:42:09.631 --> 02:42:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I remember your debut.</v>

6683
02:42:10.860 --> 02:42:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was,</v>

02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:16.793
<v Speaker 1>How's he doing?</v>

6687
02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:18.480
<v Speaker 1>He's doing,</v>

6688
02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:18.781

<v Speaker 1>Tough motherfucker.</v>

6696

6697
02:42:28.891 --> 02:42:31.440
<v Speaker 1>thought that he was the next guy.</v>

6698

6701
02:42:36.331 --> 02:42:37.320
<v Speaker 1>so hands up wouldn't lose.</v>

6702
02:42:38.340 --> 02:42:39.210
<v Speaker 1>That was in Brazil,</v>

02:42:39.211 --> 02:42:39.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6704
02:42:39.630 --> 02:42:40.370
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>

6705
02:42:40.370 --> 02:42:41.130
<v Speaker 1>It was back then.</v>

6706
02:42:41.130 --> 02:42:41.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

02:42:50.820 --> 02:42:51.653
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6713
02:42:51.780 --> 02:42:52.613
<v Speaker 1>the old days.</v>

6714
02:42:53.220 --> 02:42:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6715
02:42:53.790 --> 02:42:54.481
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

6716
02:42:54.481 --> 02:42:55.350
<v Speaker 1>It's been so long.</v>

6717
02:42:55.380 --> 02:42:57.330
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting when you stop and think about it,</v>

6718
02:42:57.360 --> 02:42:59.070
<v Speaker 1>how many thousands of flights with you called?</v>

6719
02:42:59.460 --> 02:43:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I've seen way too many people get fucked up.</v>

6720
02:43:01.350 --> 02:43:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

6721
02:43:02.100 --> 02:43:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm real numb to watch it.</v>

6722
02:43:03.691 --> 02:43:04.530
<v Speaker 1>People get beat up.</v>

6723
02:43:04.750 --> 02:43:05.220
<v Speaker 1>That's my,</v>

6724
02:43:05.220 --> 02:43:05.970
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing.</v>

6725
02:43:05.970 --> 02:43:07.170
<v Speaker 1>That's too,</v>

6726
02:43:08.070 --> 02:43:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I would say as my coaching career progressed,</v>

6727
02:43:10.531 --> 02:43:11.364
<v Speaker 1>as I got older,</v>

6728
02:43:11.470 --> 02:43:15.580
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're young and you're full of testosterone in near a psychopath</v>

6729
02:43:16.060 --> 02:43:16.930
<v Speaker 1>and you're coaching,</v>

6730
02:43:16.931 --> 02:43:17.261
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

6731
02:43:17.261 --> 02:43:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6732
02:43:17.470 --> 02:43:18.303
<v Speaker 1>let's go do this.</v>

6733
02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:18.791
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

6734
02:43:18.791 --> 02:43:19.450
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

6735
02:43:19.450 --> 02:43:21.610
<v Speaker 1>And as I got older and mellowed out,</v>

6736
02:43:22.420 --> 02:43:25.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean I had to lay down on the floor of the locker room before the first Hugh's</v>

6737
02:43:25.721 --> 02:43:26.554
<v Speaker 1>trig fight.</v>

6738
02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Cause I knew Trigg was a dangerous dude,</v>

6739
02:43:28.570 --> 02:43:30.580
<v Speaker 1>just a tough son of a bitch and a good wrestler.</v>

6740
02:43:30.581 --> 02:43:31.414
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6741
02:43:31.630 --> 02:43:33.130
<v Speaker 1>And I was really nervous for that fight.</v>

6742
02:43:33.131 --> 02:43:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I had to lay on my back and just decompress for 30 minutes before that fight</v>

6743
02:43:36.190 --> 02:43:39.180
<v Speaker 1>just to go out and just coach with,</v>

6744
02:43:39.250 --> 02:43:39.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6745
02:43:39.850 --> 02:43:40.990
<v Speaker 1>with a car mine,</v>

6746
02:43:41.530 --> 02:43:41.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6747
02:43:41.911 --> 02:43:42.080
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

6748
02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:42.913
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

6749
02:43:43.390 --> 02:43:43.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6750
02:43:43.780 --> 02:43:45.400
<v Speaker 1>when he was fought Carlos Newton,</v>

6751
02:43:45.401 --> 02:43:49.690
<v Speaker 1>after Carlos took the title from me and Carlos comes out and we were infuriated</v>

6752
02:43:49.691 --> 02:43:51.940
<v Speaker 1>because he's walking out with two playboy bunnies and you know,</v>

6753
02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:52.990
<v Speaker 1>acting and that was,</v>

6754
02:43:52.991 --> 02:43:53.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6755
02:43:53.231 --> 02:43:53.741
<v Speaker 1>it's a show,</v>

6756
02:43:53.741 --> 02:43:54.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6757
02:43:54.010 --> 02:43:54.461
<v Speaker 1>It's a show.</v>

6758
02:43:54.461 --> 02:43:55.900
<v Speaker 1>It's how it was when that big ramp.</v>

6759
02:43:56.850 --> 02:43:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6760
02:43:57.220 --> 02:44:01.060
<v Speaker 1>And so he was standing there and I was all pumped up and I was like,</v>

6761
02:44:01.061 --> 02:44:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

6762
02:44:01.870 --> 02:44:02.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6763
02:44:02.291 --> 02:44:04.720
<v Speaker 1>we had to get mad off a tractor on the farm to come and fight him.</v>

6764
02:44:04.780 --> 02:44:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6765
02:44:05.350 --> 02:44:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Cause my automatic rematch clause got,</v>

6766
02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:09.850
<v Speaker 1>they reneged on that and say it's your choice.</v>

6767
02:44:09.851 --> 02:44:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Either Mac and fight him or somebody from another camp.</v>

6768
02:44:11.861 --> 02:44:13.420
<v Speaker 1>But if Matt or somebody from another,</v>

6769
02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:14.850
<v Speaker 1>if somebody from another camp fights,</v>

6770
02:44:14.851 --> 02:44:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've got the winter no matter what.</v>

6771
02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:18.220
<v Speaker 1>But if Matt fights him and loses,</v>

6772
02:44:18.221 --> 02:44:18.580
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

6773
02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:19.870
<v Speaker 1>you can rematch Carlos.</v>

6774
02:44:19.871 --> 02:44:20.651
<v Speaker 1>But if Matt wins,</v>

6775
02:44:20.651 --> 02:44:22.480
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's Kinda tough cause we're buddies.</v>

6776
02:44:22.481 --> 02:44:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6777
02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:23.613
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6778
02:44:23.710 --> 02:44:26.020
<v Speaker 1>So Matt standing inside the cage and I'm pumped.</v>

6779
02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely pumped.</v>

6780
02:44:27.070 --> 02:44:27.221
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

6781
02:44:27.221 --> 02:44:28.280
<v Speaker 1>you got to smash this guy.</v>

6782
02:44:28.281 --> 02:44:28.781
<v Speaker 1>I'm screaming.</v>

6783
02:44:28.781 --> 02:44:29.021
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

6784
02:44:29.021 --> 02:44:30.120
<v Speaker 1>you got to fucking smash him.</v>

6785
02:44:30.460 --> 02:44:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And Matt turns around and he goes,</v>

6786
02:44:32.470 --> 02:44:33.101
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be okay,</v>

6787
02:44:33.101 --> 02:44:33.934

02:44:38.710 --> 02:44:39.780
<v Speaker 1>That was a crazy winter.</v>

6795
02:44:39.790 --> 02:44:41.410
<v Speaker 1>That's when he slammed him with a triangle.</v>

6796
02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6797
02:44:42.130 --> 02:44:42.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6798
02:44:43.960 --> 02:44:44.710
<v Speaker 1>The entire crowd.</v>

6799
02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Their mouths were hanging open.</v>

6800
02:44:45.970 --> 02:44:47.110
<v Speaker 1>They'd never seen anything like that.</v>

6801
02:44:47.111 --> 02:44:47.410
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

6802
02:44:47.410 --> 02:44:48.910
<v Speaker 1>well was he kinda half out?</v>

6803
02:44:49.300 --> 02:44:50.260
<v Speaker 1>He was out triangle.</v>

6804
02:44:50.290 --> 02:44:51.370
<v Speaker 1>He was just out with the triangle.</v>

6805
02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:54.820
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] was going out and slammed him and then went out.</v>

6806
02:44:54.850 --> 02:44:55.683
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

6807
02:44:56.780 --> 02:44:57.730
<v Speaker 1>that's why he jumped up and said,</v>

6808
02:44:57.731 --> 02:44:58.391
<v Speaker 1>I want Matt.</v>

6809
02:44:58.391 --> 02:44:58.571
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6810
02:44:58.571 --> 02:45:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Matt sits up like this and he's kind of looking around and I dove over the cage</v>

6811
02:45:03.430 --> 02:45:08.430
<v Speaker 1>and my let my legs catch on one side so that that could barely touch Matt's head</v>

6812
02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:09.491
<v Speaker 1>with my hand.</v>

6813
02:45:09.491 --> 02:45:10.960
<v Speaker 1>And they scraped his hair really fast and I'm like,</v>

6814
02:45:10.961 --> 02:45:11.201

02:45:11.201 --> 02:45:11.441

02:45:11.441 --> 02:45:11.711
<v Speaker 1>get up,</v>

6817
02:45:11.711 --> 02:45:12.010
<v Speaker 1>get up.</v>

6818
02:45:12.010 --> 02:45:12.843
<v Speaker 1>I knew he was out.</v>

6819
02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

6820
02:45:13.270 --> 02:45:14.021
<v Speaker 1>so get up,</v>

6821
02:45:14.021 --> 02:45:15.280
<v Speaker 1>get up and he stands up and he goes,</v>

6822
02:45:15.970 --> 02:45:16.803
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

6823
02:45:17.050 --> 02:45:17.681
<v Speaker 1>And Jeremy Goes,</v>

6825
02:45:21.310 --> 02:45:21.970
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

6826
02:45:21.970 --> 02:45:22.600
<v Speaker 1>That was cool.</v>

6827
02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:23.530
<v Speaker 1>That was a cool fight.</v>

6828
02:45:24.250 --> 02:45:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6829
02:45:24.580 --> 02:45:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Very intense.</v>

6830
02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:25.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6831
02:45:25.391 --> 02:45:26.230
<v Speaker 1>that was very intense.</v>

6832
02:45:26.231 --> 02:45:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Carlos Newton was one of the most technical Jujitsu guys.</v>

6833
02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:29.853
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

6834
02:45:29.980 --> 02:45:31.990
<v Speaker 1>He was very athletic dude.</v>

6835
02:45:32.100 --> 02:45:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6836
02:45:32.790 --> 02:45:36.100
<v Speaker 1>One of the best sites I've ever seen to this day was he and Dan Henderson.</v>

6837
02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

6838
02:45:36.970 --> 02:45:38.320
<v Speaker 1>That was an insane fight.</v>

6839
02:45:38.321 --> 02:45:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6840
02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:39.590
<v Speaker 1>those guys are great fight.</v>

6841
02:45:39.790 --> 02:45:43.110
<v Speaker 1>That was 97 [inaudible] 97 and possibly somewhere in that era.</v>

6842
02:45:43.420 --> 02:45:44.590
<v Speaker 1>That was one of my early days.</v>

6843
02:45:44.620 --> 02:45:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Chuck Ladell made his UFC debut.</v>

6844
02:45:47.230 --> 02:45:50.350
<v Speaker 1>I think he fought noe Hernandez and appreciate he's wearing wrestling shoes.</v>

6845
02:45:50.380 --> 02:45:50.631
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6846
02:45:50.631 --> 02:45:52.600
<v Speaker 1>he Hernandez trained with me for that fight.</v>

6847
02:45:52.601 --> 02:45:53.434
<v Speaker 1>And no,</v>

6848
02:45:53.490 --> 02:45:54.850
<v Speaker 1>he got hurt before that flight.</v>

6849
02:45:54.851 --> 02:45:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what he injured,</v>

6850
02:45:56.740 --> 02:45:57.431
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

6851
02:45:57.431 --> 02:45:58.810
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't train hard for that fight.</v>

6852
02:45:58.811 --> 02:46:00.010
<v Speaker 1>So he wasn't in great shape.</v>

6853
02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:02.770
<v Speaker 1>But he was knocking the shit out of chuck until he ran out of gas.</v>

6854
02:46:02.771 --> 02:46:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was boxing Chuck's ears off,</v>

6855
02:46:05.150 --> 02:46:06.060
<v Speaker 1>knocking down a flight.</v>

6856
02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Peretti came to chuck and told them if you want to keep working and to keep</v>

6857
02:46:09.381 --> 02:46:10.400
<v Speaker 1>fighting for the UFC,</v>

6858
02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:11.660
<v Speaker 2>do not take this guy down.</v>

6859
02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:12.621
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

6860
02:46:12.621 --> 02:46:12.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6861
02:46:12.921 --> 02:46:14.420
<v Speaker 2>because they found out the chuck was a wrestler.</v>

6862
02:46:14.510 --> 02:46:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Ah Wow.</v>

6863
02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:16.520
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

6864
02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:18.020
<v Speaker 2>those are the dirty days.</v>

6865
02:46:19.250 --> 02:46:20.750
<v Speaker 2>That was a Gary shot.</v>

6866
02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:21.430
<v Speaker 2>The Gary Shaw,</v>

6867
02:46:21.430 --> 02:46:21.980
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

6868
02:46:21.980 --> 02:46:23.950
<v Speaker 2>Petros Ellian sharematch type stuff.</v>

6869
02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:24.793
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6870
02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Petros only had to stand up with Kimbo cause he replaced shamrock.</v>

6871
02:46:27.730 --> 02:46:28.760
<v Speaker 2>Aw Man,</v>

6872
02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:30.320
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about that guy.</v>

6873
02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:33.200
<v Speaker 2>One of the greatest interviews ever was Dana white after that.</v>

6874
02:46:33.950 --> 02:46:35.360
<v Speaker 2>Remember when he looks at the camera and he goes,</v>

6875
02:46:35.361 --> 02:46:35.931
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

6876
02:46:35.931 --> 02:46:38.450
<v Speaker 2>It's book and that's fucking illegal.</v>

6877
02:46:38.451 --> 02:46:38.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6878
02:46:38.841 --> 02:46:40.010
<v Speaker 2>it is fucking illegal.</v>

6879
02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:42.440
<v Speaker 2>That was the dumbest matchup to when I,</v>

6880
02:46:42.441 --> 02:46:46.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a video of me in the green room of the punchline in Atlanta,</v>

6881
02:46:46.701 --> 02:46:47.534
<v Speaker 2>Georgia.</v>

6882
02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:52.460
<v Speaker 2>I had gotten off stage and I was waiting to see Ken shamrock fight keep Kimbo</v>

6883
02:46:52.490 --> 02:46:52.790
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

6884
02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:53.211
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

6885
02:46:53.211 --> 02:46:54.380
<v Speaker 2>what a fight this is going to be.</v>

6886
02:46:54.530 --> 02:46:56.960
<v Speaker 2>I get off stage and they say,</v>

6887
02:46:57.020 --> 02:46:57.410
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6888
02:46:57.410 --> 02:47:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Ken shamrock got hurt and warming up and Kimbo is now fighting Seth Petras</v>

6889
02:47:02.690 --> 02:47:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Ellie.</v>

6890
02:47:03.170 --> 02:47:03.650
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

6891
02:47:03.650 --> 02:47:03.861
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6892
02:47:03.861 --> 02:47:05.350
<v Speaker 2>this is a terrible idea.</v>

6893
02:47:05.370 --> 02:47:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Fucking and I said it and I said to the camera,</v>

6894
02:47:08.420 --> 02:47:09.530
<v Speaker 2>it's like the craziest thing ever.</v>

6895
02:47:09.531 --> 02:47:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

6896
02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:10.791
<v Speaker 2>Seth Patch jail.</v>

6897
02:47:10.791 --> 02:47:11.690
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna fuck him up.</v>

6898
02:47:12.050 --> 02:47:12.471
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

6899
02:47:12.471 --> 02:47:12.801
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

6900
02:47:12.801 --> 02:47:14.370
<v Speaker 2>we're assuming he's going to take him down and submit it.</v>

6901
02:47:14.420 --> 02:47:14.810
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

6902
02:47:14.810 --> 02:47:16.130
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was going to KLM.</v>

6903
02:47:16.580 --> 02:47:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Seth was way better striker.</v>

6904
02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:19.460
<v Speaker 2>I thought something was going to take him down.</v>

6905
02:47:19.490 --> 02:47:21.500
<v Speaker 2>I thought Seth is a karate striker,</v>

6906
02:47:21.501 --> 02:47:24.160
<v Speaker 2>like at legit season black belts.</v>

6907
02:47:24.161 --> 02:47:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6908
02:47:24.380 --> 02:47:24.580
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

6909
02:47:24.580 --> 02:47:24.861
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

6910
02:47:24.861 --> 02:47:25.370
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

6911
02:47:25.370 --> 02:47:26.840
<v Speaker 2>he could submit guys,</v>

6912
02:47:26.930 --> 02:47:27.620
<v Speaker 2>but he's just a,</v>

6913
02:47:27.620 --> 02:47:30.290
<v Speaker 2>he was on another level as a mixed martial artist.</v>

6914
02:47:30.291 --> 02:47:31.980
<v Speaker 2>I was like Kimbos ineffective.</v>

6915
02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:35.390
<v Speaker 2>So here's me while this is happening,</v>

6916
02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:38.070
<v Speaker 5>if I'm wrong and never see this to go to the beginning,</v>

6917
02:47:38.700 --> 02:47:39.090
<v Speaker 5>hold on.</v>

6918
02:47:39.090 --> 02:47:40.830
<v Speaker 2>It's what it said in the beginning.</v>

6919
02:47:41.170 --> 02:47:42.280
<v Speaker 5>Fuck Kimbo slice.</v>

6920
02:47:42.510 --> 02:47:43.840
<v Speaker 5>This is a last minute replacement.</v>

6921
02:47:44.070 --> 02:47:44.930
<v Speaker 5>I got to take set parts.</v>

6922
02:47:44.980 --> 02:47:45.640
<v Speaker 5>Set purchase though.</v>

6923
02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:46.473
<v Speaker 5>He's gonna fuck him up</v>

6924
02:47:47.980 --> 02:47:49.420
<v Speaker 5>if I'm wrong and never see this.</v>

6925
02:47:51.310 --> 02:47:54.970
<v Speaker 5>So it happens in the green row in literally the fight is six seconds long.</v>

6926
02:48:00.370 --> 02:48:01.430
<v Speaker 5>Well</v>

6927
02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:08.633
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

6928
02:48:12.470 --> 02:48:13.880
<v Speaker 2>You look older.</v>

6929
02:48:13.881 --> 02:48:15.470
<v Speaker 2>There was a beard.</v>

6930
02:48:15.590 --> 02:48:16.880
<v Speaker 2>I had that full beard back then.</v>

6931
02:48:17.090 --> 02:48:18.350
<v Speaker 2>That was after Evan died.</v>

6932
02:48:18.590 --> 02:48:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Whenever Tanner died,</v>

6933
02:48:19.611 --> 02:48:20.570
<v Speaker 2>we all grew beards.</v>

6934
02:48:20.660 --> 02:48:20.941
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

6935
02:48:20.941 --> 02:48:21.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

6936
02:48:21.220 --> 02:48:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6937
02:48:22.010 --> 02:48:22.821
<v Speaker 2>That was a bad deal,</v>

6938
02:48:22.821 --> 02:48:23.400
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6939
02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:24.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm sad.</v>

6940
02:48:24.140 --> 02:48:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Very bad.</v>

6941
02:48:24.710 --> 02:48:24.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6942
02:48:24.951 --> 02:48:25.641
<v Speaker 2>That guy was,</v>

6943
02:48:25.641 --> 02:48:26.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6944
02:48:26.180 --> 02:48:27.950
<v Speaker 2>I think he rolled out there into the desert.</v>

6945
02:48:27.951 --> 02:48:28.641
<v Speaker 2>It was on a mission,</v>

6946
02:48:28.641 --> 02:48:30.260
<v Speaker 2>I think might have,</v>

6947
02:48:30.330 --> 02:48:30.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6948
02:48:30.940 --> 02:48:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe when he was out there he decided to go that way.</v>

6949
02:48:34.131 --> 02:48:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you just really did get lost and couldn't find his water.</v>

6950
02:48:36.861 --> 02:48:38.930
<v Speaker 2>But that's one of the hottest places on earth.</v>

6951
02:48:38.950 --> 02:48:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6952
02:48:39.350 --> 02:48:41.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean he gets to the one thirties and stuff.</v>

6953
02:48:41.890 --> 02:48:42.723
<v Speaker 2>It's just not,</v>

6954
02:48:42.810 --> 02:48:43.643
<v Speaker 2>that was a bummer.</v>

6955
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:44.211
<v Speaker 2>It a bummer.</v>

6956
02:48:44.211 --> 02:48:45.020
<v Speaker 2>He was a great guy.</v>

6957
02:48:45.020 --> 02:48:46.520
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting guy too.</v>

6958
02:48:46.580 --> 02:48:46.941
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6959
02:48:46.941 --> 02:48:47.171
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

6960
02:48:47.171 --> 02:48:47.341
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

6961
02:48:47.341 --> 02:48:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I really wasn't into the money.</v>

6962
02:48:48.741 --> 02:48:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Really wasn't mean.</v>

6963
02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:52.400
<v Speaker 2>He was into the journey and difficult quite,</v>

6964
02:48:52.401 --> 02:48:53.870
<v Speaker 2>he probably would've loved the ultra running.</v>

6965
02:48:54.170 --> 02:48:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6966
02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:54.801
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

6967
02:48:54.801 --> 02:48:56.000
<v Speaker 2>And he fought down.</v>

6968
02:48:56.150 --> 02:48:58.580
<v Speaker 2>What was the show in Texas that they were doing back then?</v>

6969
02:48:58.610 --> 02:49:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Cause he cut his teeth in that circuit down there in Texas.</v>

6970
02:49:01.731 --> 02:49:03.080
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what shows those.</v>

6971
02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Remember he fought checks is fighting championship or something.</v>

6972
02:49:05.810 --> 02:49:08.400
<v Speaker 2>He was a tough motherfucker man when he fought Dave Turrell.</v>

6973
02:49:08.550 --> 02:49:09.383
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

6974
02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:11.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean Dave Terrell had them in a guillotine,</v>

6975
02:49:11.490 --> 02:49:13.430
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't tap and then he starts smashing them and that,</v>

6976
02:49:13.431 --> 02:49:14.940
<v Speaker 3>that's how he wanted to try was talented.</v>

6977
02:49:14.970 --> 02:49:15.421
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

6978
02:49:15.421 --> 02:49:16.140
<v Speaker 3>Yay was,</v>

6979
02:49:16.140 --> 02:49:18.930
<v Speaker 3>but he was mentally like he would fall apart.</v>

6980
02:49:18.931 --> 02:49:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6981
02:49:19.530 --> 02:49:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Well he did in that fight,</v>

6982
02:49:20.850 --> 02:49:22.470
<v Speaker 3>or at least he gassed out.</v>

6983
02:49:22.500 --> 02:49:23.040
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

6984
02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:24.300
<v Speaker 3>something happened in that fight.</v>

6985
02:49:24.301 --> 02:49:24.871
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

6986
02:49:24.871 --> 02:49:28.200
<v Speaker 3>that was the word is that his talent never matched up to his performances.</v>

6987
02:49:28.590 --> 02:49:30.180
<v Speaker 3>And as a Jujitsu player though,</v>

6988
02:49:30.181 --> 02:49:31.140
<v Speaker 3>he was very,</v>

6989
02:49:31.141 --> 02:49:32.070
<v Speaker 3>very successful.</v>

6990
02:49:32.071 --> 02:49:32.820
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

6991
02:49:32.820 --> 02:49:34.410
<v Speaker 3>I saw him fighting Abu Dhabi.</v>

6992
02:49:34.411 --> 02:49:36.120
<v Speaker 3>Who's a fucking [inaudible] man.</v>

6993
02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:40.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was phenomenal and to this day produces some of the best black belts.</v>

6994
02:49:40.350 --> 02:49:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Who's the best grappler on the planet now?</v>

6995
02:49:42.061 --> 02:49:42.540
<v Speaker 3>You think?</v>

6996
02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:43.470
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

6997
02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:45.030
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to tell.</v>

6998
02:49:45.031 --> 02:49:45.271
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6999
02:49:45.271 --> 02:49:46.770
<v Speaker 3>it's probably Danaher's guys.</v>

7000
02:49:46.771 --> 02:49:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

7001
02:49:47.220 --> 02:49:47.640
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

7002
02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:47.960
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

7003
02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:52.020
<v Speaker 3>it's probably Gordon Ryan or maybe Gary Tonin or one of those guys.</v>

7004
02:49:52.020 --> 02:49:52.290
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

7005
02:49:52.290 --> 02:49:54.900
<v Speaker 3>But then there's a lot of really high level Jujitsu guys.</v>

7006
02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:55.261
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

7007
02:49:55.261 --> 02:49:56.520
<v Speaker 3>the thing is these,</v>

7008
02:49:56.700 --> 02:49:59.970
<v Speaker 3>no one has caught up to Donna hers leg game.</v>

7009
02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:00.631
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

7010
02:50:00.631 --> 02:50:00.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

7011
02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:02.340
<v Speaker 3>there's a few guys,</v>

7012
02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:03.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

7013
02:50:03.180 --> 02:50:06.240
<v Speaker 3>there's Craig Jones out of Australia that's on a real high level.</v>

7014
02:50:06.241 --> 02:50:06.570
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

7015
02:50:06.570 --> 02:50:09.780
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of guys that are closing in,</v>

7016
02:50:09.900 --> 02:50:12.870
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like what Donna is doing and he,</v>

7017
02:50:12.871 --> 02:50:13.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

7018
02:50:13.100 --> 02:50:15.750
<v Speaker 3>Donna her is such a fucking wizard.</v>

7019
02:50:16.110 --> 02:50:19.650
<v Speaker 3>He's such a genius in his application of his mind,</v>

7020
02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:19.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7021
02:50:19.981 --> 02:50:21.780
<v Speaker 3>cause Danaher's severely crippled.</v>

7022
02:50:21.781 --> 02:50:24.030
<v Speaker 3>He's got a one fake hip and they're gonna,</v>

7023
02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:25.800
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna replace one of his knees.</v>

7024
02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:30.360
<v Speaker 3>And he hurt his knee a long time ago from a rugby accident and they,</v>

7025
02:50:30.660 --> 02:50:32.640
<v Speaker 3>his knee was so loose and fucked up,</v>

7026
02:50:32.641 --> 02:50:36.330
<v Speaker 3>but they shortened his tendons to stitch them back together again.</v>

7027
02:50:36.331 --> 02:50:40.290
<v Speaker 3>But they shortened them too much and he never could fully extend his leg.</v>

7028
02:50:40.650 --> 02:50:42.330
<v Speaker 3>And he was fucked up from then on out.</v>

7029
02:50:42.331 --> 02:50:46.630
<v Speaker 3>And then it's caused by a defect in his hip because Lord,</v>

7030
02:50:46.830 --> 02:50:47.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

7031
02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:49.830
<v Speaker 3>I wore out his hip so he's severely injured.</v>

7032
02:50:50.250 --> 02:50:52.230
<v Speaker 3>But his mind is a genius.</v>

7033
02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:53.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's just very,</v>

7034
02:50:53.701 --> 02:50:54.001
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

7035
02:50:54.001 --> 02:50:55.110
<v Speaker 3>very intelligent guy.</v>

7036
02:50:55.130 --> 02:50:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Superior intellect and his,</v>

7037
02:50:57.840 --> 02:51:02.840
<v Speaker 3>the way he's applied like that thought process to Jujitsu is just incredibly</v>

7038
02:51:02.941 --> 02:51:03.600
<v Speaker 3>unique.</v>

7039
02:51:03.600 --> 02:51:04.291
<v Speaker 3>And so those guys,</v>

7040
02:51:04.291 --> 02:51:05.041
<v Speaker 3>Eddy Cummings,</v>

7041
02:51:05.041 --> 02:51:05.880
<v Speaker 3>Nikki Ryan,</v>

7042
02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:06.481
<v Speaker 3>Gordon,</v>

7043
02:51:06.481 --> 02:51:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Ryan like this,</v>

7044
02:51:07.441 --> 02:51:08.231
<v Speaker 3>this Donna,</v>

7045
02:51:08.231 --> 02:51:08.971
<v Speaker 3>her death squad,</v>

7046
02:51:08.971 --> 02:51:09.750
<v Speaker 3>what they call,</v>

7047
02:51:09.750 --> 02:51:12.690
<v Speaker 3>I have to think that at least in terms of accomplishments,</v>

7048
02:51:12.691 --> 02:51:16.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean that guy submitted a Cyborg Ricardo a brew.</v>

7049
02:51:16.081 --> 02:51:18.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean fucking easy if you watch that fight.</v>

7050
02:51:18.360 --> 02:51:19.620
<v Speaker 3>And I had um,</v>

7051
02:51:19.800 --> 02:51:23.040
<v Speaker 3>John Danaher on the podcast breakdown what he did to Cyborg.</v>

7052
02:51:23.130 --> 02:51:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Cyborg is a multiple time world champion and Gordon Ryan went right through him</v>

7053
02:51:27.271 --> 02:51:28.740
<v Speaker 3>and Gordon Ryan 22 years old.</v>

7054
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:29.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

7055
02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:30.390
<v Speaker 3>I think somewhere around there.</v>

7056
02:51:31.500 --> 02:51:32.101
<v Speaker 3>I look at it.</v>

7057
02:51:32.101 --> 02:51:32.730
<v Speaker 3>Good,</v>

7058
02:51:32.730 --> 02:51:33.071
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

7059
02:51:33.071 --> 02:51:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Grapplers throughout history from back the early Gracie's,</v>

7060
02:51:36.551 --> 02:51:36.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7061
02:51:36.731 --> 02:51:37.750
<v Speaker 1>the foreign law burns,</v>

7062
02:51:37.751 --> 02:51:39.370
<v Speaker 1>all these scary dudes and stuff.</v>

7063
02:51:39.371 --> 02:51:43.570
<v Speaker 1>And as it moves forward in time and just watching guys how they,</v>

7064
02:51:44.170 --> 02:51:46.630
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a constant cyclical,</v>

7065
02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:49.000
<v Speaker 1>there's a cycle there of you.</v>

7066
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:50.530
<v Speaker 1>You learn how to defend stuff,</v>

7067
02:51:50.560 --> 02:51:51.281
<v Speaker 1>you hit stuff,</v>

7068
02:51:51.281 --> 02:51:52.930
<v Speaker 1>people learn how to defend it and you move on.</v>

7069
02:51:52.931 --> 02:51:57.010
<v Speaker 1>And it's this constant cycle of it and the new shit coming out and creative</v>

7070
02:51:57.011 --> 02:51:57.401
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

7071
02:51:57.401 --> 02:51:59.470
<v Speaker 1>And I just watch it evolve and go,</v>

7072
02:51:59.471 --> 02:51:59.711
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

7073
02:51:59.711 --> 02:52:00.130
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

7074
02:52:00.130 --> 02:52:02.420
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could stay young forever just along with it.</v>

7075
02:52:02.440 --> 02:52:03.020
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

7076
02:52:03.020 --> 02:52:03.641
<v Speaker 1>With your body.</v>

7077
02:52:03.641 --> 02:52:03.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7078
02:52:03.941 --> 02:52:04.191
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

7079
02:52:04.191 --> 02:52:06.340
<v Speaker 1>it's an unfortunate thing that your mind,</v>

7080
02:52:06.390 --> 02:52:10.240
<v Speaker 1>he absorbs all these techniques and you understand how to compete better,</v>

7081
02:52:10.390 --> 02:52:11.500
<v Speaker 1>but your body just gives out.</v>

7082
02:52:11.501 --> 02:52:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7083
02:52:11.920 --> 02:52:13.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing with the MMA especially,</v>

7084
02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a race to amass enough knowledge to one a title before the body</v>

7085
02:52:18.851 --> 02:52:19.210
<v Speaker 1>gives out.</v>

7086
02:52:19.210 --> 02:52:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

7087
02:52:19.650 --> 02:52:20.483
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

7088
02:52:20.860 --> 02:52:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why TRT was so interesting,</v>

7089
02:52:23.090 --> 02:52:23.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7090
02:52:23.281 --> 02:52:27.700
<v Speaker 1>like the TRT v toward days because you had v toward choose to the tits.</v>

7091
02:52:28.210 --> 02:52:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And with all that experience,</v>

7092
02:52:30.161 --> 02:52:30.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7093
02:52:30.461 --> 02:52:35.020
<v Speaker 1>veto made his UFC debut back when I called my first fight and it was when I was</v>

7094
02:52:35.021 --> 02:52:39.340
<v Speaker 1>a post fight interview or rather UFC 12 that was his debut at 19 years of age.</v>

7095
02:52:39.610 --> 02:52:44.610
<v Speaker 1>So here you had him at 37 juiced out of his fucking mind with muscles on his</v>

7096
02:52:44.921 --> 02:52:45.754
<v Speaker 1>eyebrows.</v>

7097
02:52:46.030 --> 02:52:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was so jacked when he fought Rockhold when he fight Bisbing I mean</v>

7098
02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:55.960
<v Speaker 1>clearly he was not just taking testosterone replacement therapy.</v>

7099
02:52:56.170 --> 02:52:57.190
<v Speaker 1>He was juiced up.</v>

7100
02:52:57.430 --> 02:53:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was way above normal levels.</v>

7101
02:53:00.310 --> 02:53:01.900
<v Speaker 1>I remember UFC Brazil,</v>

7102
02:53:01.901 --> 02:53:05.100
<v Speaker 1>I was fighting Vandelay and veto.</v>

7103
02:53:05.101 --> 02:53:05.921
<v Speaker 1>We're fighting each other.</v>

7104
02:53:05.921 --> 02:53:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7105
02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7106
02:53:06.940 --> 02:53:08.260
<v Speaker 1>And you knew that was a collision.</v>

7107
02:53:08.320 --> 02:53:08.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7108
02:53:08.801 --> 02:53:09.910
<v Speaker 1>that was too scary dudes.</v>

7109
02:53:10.390 --> 02:53:11.920
<v Speaker 1>If he told her shoes for that fight.</v>

7110
02:53:12.280 --> 02:53:13.360
<v Speaker 1>But here's the crazy thing,</v>

7111
02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my locker room and I'm getting ready to fight and one of the tours</v>

7112
02:53:18.371 --> 02:53:19.910
<v Speaker 1>trainers comes in via tore,</v>

7113
02:53:19.911 --> 02:53:22.480
<v Speaker 1>sent them to get me to come give him a pep talk.</v>

7114
02:53:22.690 --> 02:53:23.523
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

7115
02:53:23.590 --> 02:53:26.740
<v Speaker 1>That was the fight when he had hid for like three days.</v>

7116
02:53:27.250 --> 02:53:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Cause he was terrified.</v>

7117
02:53:28.510 --> 02:53:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Fatty Lou was so scary.</v>

7118
02:53:29.810 --> 02:53:30.460
<v Speaker 1>He was having,</v>

7119
02:53:30.460 --> 02:53:33.160
<v Speaker 1>he was having just this I think a mental breakdown,</v>

7120
02:53:33.670 --> 02:53:34.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7121
02:53:34.040 --> 02:53:37.690
<v Speaker 1>an anxiety attack about fighting veto or about fighting Vandelay Silva.</v>

7122
02:53:38.350 --> 02:53:41.980
<v Speaker 1>So he's in his locker room and he's sitting in the corner and he was light with</v>

7123
02:53:41.981 --> 02:53:42.701
<v Speaker 1>his eyes big.</v>

7124
02:53:42.701 --> 02:53:43.600
<v Speaker 1>He's scared to death.</v>

7125
02:53:44.020 --> 02:53:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And I walked in there and I'm like,</v>

7126
02:53:45.580 --> 02:53:46.413
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

7127
02:53:46.450 --> 02:53:46.871
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

7128
02:53:46.871 --> 02:53:47.980
<v Speaker 1>we're fighting for world titles.</v>

7129
02:53:48.200 --> 02:53:49.120
<v Speaker 1>What are you do it?</v>

7130
02:53:49.150 --> 02:53:50.050
<v Speaker 1>What is wrong with you?</v>

7131
02:53:50.051 --> 02:53:50.884
<v Speaker 1>Let's fucking go,</v>

7132
02:53:50.900 --> 02:53:53.350
<v Speaker 1>let's fuck a Kelly's guys are getting all pumped up.</v>

7133
02:53:53.351 --> 02:53:53.681
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

7134
02:53:53.681 --> 02:53:54.514
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

7135
02:53:56.350 --> 02:53:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Well he had gotten beaten down by Randy before that.</v>

7136
02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:00.560
<v Speaker 1>That fight took a lot out of it.</v>

7137
02:54:00.700 --> 02:54:04.720
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't the same guy for a long time after that for the most brutal fight I've</v>

7138
02:54:04.721 --> 02:54:05.411
<v Speaker 1>ever seen in my life.</v>

7139
02:54:05.411 --> 02:54:07.870
<v Speaker 1>That was Amerigo [inaudible] and Don Frye.</v>

7140
02:54:08.200 --> 02:54:11.260
<v Speaker 1>I remember that in Cobo Arena in Detroit too big.</v>

7141
02:54:11.290 --> 02:54:12.940
<v Speaker 1>It was way too strong.</v>

7142
02:54:12.970 --> 02:54:16.460
<v Speaker 1>It was horrifying because Omri had shot on him and</v>

7143
02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:19.150
<v Speaker 1>he's walking his feet,</v>

7146
02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:24.420

7147
02:54:24.420 --> 02:54:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

7148
02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:26.680

7151
02:54:28.330 --> 02:54:30.580
<v Speaker 1>And all you can hear over the top of everything is,</v>

7156
02:54:36.060 --> 02:54:38.020
<v Speaker 1>like someone was being slaughtered in front of her,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7159
02:54:39.730 --> 02:54:41.440
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got as Valdo Alvarez,</v>

02:55:31.641 --> 02:55:32.480
