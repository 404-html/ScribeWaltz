00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.190
Oh,

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.380
sweet baby.

3
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:04.921
Jesus.

4
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:05.760
We're back again.

5
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:06.594
Ladies and gentlemen,

6
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.200
this a episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by

7
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:11.280
Squarespace.

8
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.331
What's that,

9
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:13.164
Joe Rogan.

10
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.120
Why am I talking about myself in the third person?

11
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.620
I've been bored with these things.

12
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.260
Squarespace is a new sponsor and it's a very cool,

13
00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:21.094
when I'm excited about it,

14
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.570
it's an extremely easy way to build an awesome website.

15
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.370
Everything is integrated.

16
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.730
You just go online and,

17
00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:32.100
and the whole setup is there for you.

18
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.050

20
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.490
to learn html.

21
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:37.320
It's super intuitive how they do it.

22
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:39.090
And you don't even have to spend money to try it.

23
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.991
If you go there,

24
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:40.824

Start building your website.

30
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.050
You can create your own online store.

31
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:50.310
It's really bad ass.

32
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.911

33
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:51.930

37
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:56.791
IPAD,

38
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:57.481
iPhone,

39
00:00:57.481 --> 00:00:58.290
android.

40
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.020
You get a free domain name if you sign up for a year.

41
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.860
Um,

42
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.990
then if you decide to use it,

43
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.190
you go,

44
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.580

45
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.750
go to squarespace.com,

46
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:08.790

47
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:09.061

you know what?

50
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:10.291
I tried this out.

51
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.124
I like it.

52
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.170
I'm going to make a website here and I'm gonna put it online.

53
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.750
Use the Code Joe Three.

54
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:16.381
It's three,

55
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:17.580
because now we're in a bunch of mark.

56
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.420
I don't know why they decided to have the number with the correlating with the

57
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:22.200
mark talking months.

58

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.320
<v 1>and if you want to sell something,</v>

74
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.670
they have a shop,

75
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.210
a feature that you can just pretty much sell anything you want to.

76
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.110
And it's really easy to upload images and it's super easy to create your own

80
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.530
It's a very cool website.

81
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.320
We're also brought to you by Ting Tang is,

82
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.610
as we said on the podcast,

83
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:08.570
if we're selling something,

84
00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:08.871
it's,

85
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:09.101
it's,

86
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:10.280
it's always going to be a good product.

87
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.780
We're not selling anything that's dog shit.

88
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.710
Um,

89
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.120
and we also wouldn't,

90
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:17.120
one of the things that we like is companies that have a good ethic behind them

91
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.120
and I've never even heard of a company like Tang before.

92
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.560
The waiting is with Ting is a cell phone company that uses the sprint backbone,

93
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.060
but they have no contracts and the way they have it set up,

94
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.250
you can buy all high end android phones.

95
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.170
They have the Samsung Galaxy s three,

96
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:36.950
the galaxy note to all those like serious killer android phones.

97
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.790
Well,

98
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.301
when you,

99
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:39.470
when you use them,

100
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:40.460
like say if you,

101
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.671
you know,

102
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:42.980
you have a plan that has x amount of minutes.

103
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.920
If you don't use a certain amount of service,

104
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.000
you use less than you thought you would take to actually drops you down.

105
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.220
So you hit credits and credits you the difference on your next bill.

106
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.440
So that mean that is like,

107
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.880
I've never even heard of that before.

108
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.400
They actually drop you down to the next level and they credit you the difference

109
00:03:02.401 --> 00:03:02.850
in money.

110
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.450
I mean,

111
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.283
that's amazing.

112
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.981
That's a,

113
00:03:04.981 --> 00:03:06.000
it's a beautiful company.

114
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.200
I think companies,

115
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.870
some companies like Tang are starting to realize,

116
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.970
do you don't have to rip people off to make money.

117
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.380
You don't have to extract every last drop of blood out of them to make money.

118
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.530
What you can do is offer people a good service within an ethical ideal behind

119
00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:22.021
it.

120
00:03:22.021 --> 00:03:22.780
And uh,

121
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.981
no,

122
00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:23.671
try to rip them off,

123
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:26.280
just trying to give him something good and people will respond.

124
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.121
And uh,

125
00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:28.800
that is what we've been seeing with Ting.

126
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.980
If you go to rogan.ting.com you can save 25 bucks off of either one of the

127
00:03:34.891 --> 00:03:37.080
android devices or their service.

128
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.590
Um,

129
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.610
I've got a lot of people from Twitter that have contacted me after switching

130
00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:44.400
over to tank and told me how much money they're saving and a,

131
00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:44.671
you know,

132
00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:46.140
like real substantial money.

133
00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:48.000
And people were very happy with the service.

134
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:52.920
It's on sprint and it's not like it's a small mom and pop cell phone company.

135
00:03:52.921 --> 00:03:54.120
It's on the sprint backbone.

136
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.841
They uh,

137
00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:55.830
they buy time there,

138
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.211
so it's,

139
00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:57.750
it's a really bad ass service.

140
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.280
So please go and check it out.

141
00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:01.140
rogan.ting.com.

142
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.920

150
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.220
That's quite show.

Dammit.

153
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.800
It's a comedy show.

154
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.450
This Thursday night at the,

155
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:15.960
uh,

156
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.170
one of the coolest comedy clubs in the southern California area.

157
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.250

158
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.060

there's like a couple of blocks on Melrose where you might catch somebody's

172
00:04:46.101 --> 00:04:46.790
walking around.

173
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.180
Right.

174
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.481
But,

175
00:04:47.481 --> 00:04:47.780
uh,

176
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.471
for the most part,

177
00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:50.030
people are not really walking around,

178
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.500
you know,

179
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.350
and their cars.

180
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.950
Yeah.

181
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.670
That's about it.

182
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.031
So,

183
00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:53.211
uh,

184
00:04:53.211 --> 00:04:56.600
it's this Thursday night and the lineup is a Yoshi,

185
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.200
uh,

186
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.330
you've heard him on our podcast and she didn't,

187
00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.481
no,

188
00:04:59.481 --> 00:05:01.010
she didn't podcast a,

189
00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:01.720
he's also,

190
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.040
a lot of times it's on David chose podcasts.

191
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.551
Very,

192
00:05:04.551 --> 00:05:05.251
very funny guy.

193
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:06.150
Billy button now.

194
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:07.010
A very funny guy.

195
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.510
Jason [inaudible] of course,

196
00:05:08.511 --> 00:05:09.890
our buddy we've had him on before.

197
00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:10.251
It's very,

198
00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:15.251
very cool guy and funny guy and Tony Hinchcliffe really hot up and coming comic.

199
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.080
I really believe that Tony Hinchcliffe like five,

200
00:05:18.081 --> 00:05:19.610
six years from now is going to be like,

201
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.890
<v 1>he's,</v>

202
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:20.570
he's serious.

203
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.931
Fuck up.

204
00:05:20.931 --> 00:05:21.191
You know what?

205
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:24.710
I was watching him last night and the most amazing thing about him is how fast

206
00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:25.041
he was.

207
00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:26.390
Like he was doing a,

208
00:05:26.391 --> 00:05:26.960
uh,

209
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.850
Don Barrett's goes,

210
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.011
uh,

211
00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:30.260
what do you think the lead singer of counting crows,

212
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.610
is he Jewish or not Jewish?

213
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.960
And Tony Goes,

214
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.350
uh,

215
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.670
Jewish Jewish.

216
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.670
It should be the accounting crows

217
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.430
and it was so fast.

218
00:05:40.431 --> 00:05:40.671
I was like,

219
00:05:40.671 --> 00:05:42.390
how the fuck did you do that that fast?

220
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.620
He's,

221
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.811
he's,

222
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:42.911
he's,

223
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:43.490
it's hilarious.

224
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.061
<v 0>He's a very,</v>

225
00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:44.691
very funny guy.

226
00:05:44.691 --> 00:05:46.130
So that's our next Thursday night.

227
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.053
It's Thursday.

228
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.600
I'm sorry.

229
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.400
This as the next one that comes up.

230
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.000
Yeah,

231
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.690
this one,

232
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.050
this one and three days and it's American Comedy code.com for tickets.

233
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.390
We were also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com.

234
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.690
Um,

235
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.070
but one the things you start carrying it.

236
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.551
It's o,

237
00:05:58.551 --> 00:05:58.731
n,

238
00:05:58.731 --> 00:05:58.971
N,

239
00:05:58.971 --> 00:05:59.804
I t.

240
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.230
Um,

241
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.340
one of the things that,

242
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:01.880
uh,

243
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.180
we started carrying his,

244
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.870
we started carrying these fitness,

245
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.410
uh,

246
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.800
apparatus things like kettlebells and now we've added to them,

247
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:10.381
we have a,

248
00:06:10.381 --> 00:06:11.214
a mace,

249
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.210
which is this crazy pipe with a metal ball.

250
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:17.720
It looks like a mapping and a steel club against not a weapon.

251
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.770
Club bells are a very functional way to,

252
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:22.100
uh,

253
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.820
to get straight,

254
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.990
especially in your shoulders.

255
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.100
They're not even that heavy.

256
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:25.521
The ones,

257
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:25.761
uh,

258
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:28.460
I use you use between like 15 and 25 pounds.

259
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.600
It seems like nothing.

260
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.170
But when you do all these things like they're called shield casts and all these

261
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:35.630
different exercises with the clubs,

262
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.150
you'd be amazed at how much they wear you out.

263
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.020
Um,

264
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.020
one of the things that on it is interested in,

265
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.200
and then really the only thing we're interested in is things that increase your

266
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:46.370
physical performance.

267
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.480
Um,

268
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.010
is a lot of people out there doing like bicep curls and doing like traditional

269
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:55.040
weightlifting exercises and they don't really understand,

270
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.630
uh,

271
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.191
like what,

272
00:06:56.191 --> 00:06:59.600
what you can get some benefit out of any kind of lifting weights,

273
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.230
but to really get the maximum amount of benefit from your time,

274
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:08.030
you wanted to do something that involves your whole body and you'd be amazed at

275
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:10.800
what kind of a workout you can get with a 35 pound kettle bell.

276
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.091
I mean,

277
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:12.380
it is phenomenal.

278
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:12.591
Me.

279
00:07:12.591 --> 00:07:13.680
You can get it.

280
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.891
I mean,

281
00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:14.091
I mean,

282
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:15.380
I'm talking 20 minutes in,

283
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.870
you're ready to die from a 35 pound Kettlebell.

284
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.010
Um,

285
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.860
go to [inaudible] dot com and check out all of the,

286
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:22.694
um,

287
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.331
all the,

288
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:24.200
all the fitness equipment.

289
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:25.520
And I always advise anybody,

290
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:27.500
if you've been thinking about doing something like that,

291
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.610
get a trainer.

292
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:33.610
Just hire at least once to have someone show you how to do the proper maneuvers

293
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.280
so you're not,

294
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.340
you use proper technique and not putting a lot of strain on your body.

295
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.211
You really should,

296
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:39.021
if you can afford it,

297
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:39.854
get a trainer.

298
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.521
If you can't,

299
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:44.800
there are some online videos you can get off of youtube that are good,

300
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.320
um,

301
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.430
instructional videos,

302
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:50.240
but it's very important to start light and use good form.

303
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.870
You can always get injured in lifting weights,

304
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.541
boss route,

305
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:54.680
and we'll tell you about that later.

306
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:55.240
Um,

307
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.450
I,

308
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:55.731
you know,

309
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:57.830
I've been injured many times exercising.

310
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.000
It's just part of the program.

311
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:00.170
If you want to get fit,

312
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.600
you have to take chances and if you take chances,

313
00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:03.440
sometimes you get hurt.

314
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.430
But you want to minimize that as much as possible.

315
00:08:05.431 --> 00:08:07.940
And one of the best ways is good form use.

316
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.180
Always use good form.

317
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.930
Never allow yourself to get sloppy when you're training.

318
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.460
And if you feel like you're getting sloppy,

319
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:15.620
most likely you're using two heavyweight.

320
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.220
Um,

321
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.630
it's just for functional strength.

322
00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:20.660
You really can't beat the stuff that we have at [inaudible] dot com battle

323
00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:20.991
ropes,

324
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:21.741
kettle bells,

325
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:23.000
Macy's steel clubs.

326
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.020
We also have a gang of supplements including the famous Alpha brain,

327
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.080
one of the best cognitive enhancing supplement I've ever taken.

328
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.711
It's a,

329
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:31.970
as far as vitamins go,

330
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.680
not including certain smart drugs that probably will be illegal soon.

331
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:37.940
But other than that,

332
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.080
Alpha brains is shit.

333
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.980
It's uh,

334
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.560
it's all basically the building blocks for human neurotransmitters.

335
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.270
It's all,

336
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.900
all the essential nutrients that help your mind function at its best.

337
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:48.620
Um,

338
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.200
there's a lot of controversy when it comes to any of this stuff and that's one

339
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:52.160
of the reasons why it on it.

340
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.480

sincere.

355
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:21.121

356
00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:21.300
uh,

357
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.190

358
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:23.421

Same here.

374
00:09:58.651 --> 00:09:58.891
You know,

375
00:09:58.891 --> 00:09:59.111
I'm,

376
00:09:59.111 --> 00:10:01.230
I'm amazed with the commercials.

377
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:04.440
You Fox shit mother fuckers,

378
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:04.711
you know,

379
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:05.011
that's,

380
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:06.740
that's great way to,

381
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:07.171
you know,

382
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:07.920
get it out there.

383
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.071
Well,

384
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:08.851
you know what it is,

385
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:09.170
man,

386
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.560
you gotta be yourself.

387
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.700
You've got to always be yourself,

388
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:12.330
you know,

389
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.940
and anybody who doesn't want to hear that kind of stuff,

390
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:15.810
I don't want them less than.

391
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.390
So it's a way of filtering out tight asses.

392
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.940
I don't think that anybody hit the delete button right now.

393
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:21.961
You never know,

394
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:22.291
man.

395
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:24.450
This dude's will get pissed off at anything.

396
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.320
They will decide that your commercial is the reason why their life sucks.

397
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.150
This motherfucker in his audit,

398
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.810
fuck you and fuck on it,

399
00:10:31.811 --> 00:10:33.420
and they'll shoot their fucking computers.

400
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.810
There's someone out there that you're,

401
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:35.590
you're catching them.

402
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.800
They're there at nine before you even meet them.

403
00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:39.180
Just Eh,

404
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.770
and then they just decide.

405
00:10:40.771 --> 00:10:43.230
It's that fucking boss route and o tube trainer.

406
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:43.711
Yes.

407
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:47.900
That sent me over the Tacos that my wife gave it to me just before I walked out

408
00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:48.251
and she says,

409
00:10:48.251 --> 00:10:49.081
you're going to be on camera,

410
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:49.440
right?

411
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.273
Yeah.

412
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.353
You're that

413
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.930
<v 0>trainer is a,</v>

414
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.820
it's like for include improving the strength of your lungs.

415
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:56.480
Is that what it is?

416
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.313
That's it and cool.

417
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.720
Yeah.

418
00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.810
We talked about it as much,

419
00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:59.630
you don't know,

420
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.000
boss route and former UFC heavyweight champion.

421
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.510
If you're not into the world of martial arts,

422
00:11:05.511 --> 00:11:07.310
I should always introduce my guests.

423
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:07.781
I never do.

424
00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:08.750
I just start conversations.

425
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.500
Bosses,

426
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:09.980
a good friends,

427
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.050
but a good friend for years and one of the,

428
00:11:12.051 --> 00:11:14.240
one of the greatest mixed martial arts fighters in history,

429
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.200
we legit,

430
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.441
you're a,

431
00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:15.801
you're a,

432
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:16.520
you're a legend.

433
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.353
Like you know,

434
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:17.931
you,

435
00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:19.900
when you fought a [inaudible] Osaka,

436
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:20.600
you know,

437
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.590
that was a,

438
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:26.620
that was like one of the highest level MMA fights that we had ever seen up to

439
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.140
that day.

440
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:27.351
You know,

441
00:11:27.351 --> 00:11:27.771
like you,

442
00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:28.280
you,

443
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.870
when you came into the scene,

444
00:11:29.871 --> 00:11:31.160
when you won the heavyweight title,

445
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.170
you elevated the entire sport.

446
00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:34.400
Like you were the fucking man.

447
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:35.440
Wow.

448
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.130
You know?

449
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:36.491
<v 2>No,</v>

450
00:11:36.491 --> 00:11:36.731
no,

451
00:11:36.731 --> 00:11:37.420
I didn't know that.

452
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:37.901
I do know,

453
00:11:37.901 --> 00:11:40.900
I recently found out that that was actually the first heavyweight champion.

454
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:41.950
I didn't know that.

455
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:42.101
Well,

456
00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:45.610
you were actually super fights for you.

457
00:11:45.611 --> 00:11:46.690
Not only that you are,

458
00:11:46.691 --> 00:11:48.700
you were only about 210,

459
00:11:48.701 --> 00:11:50.770
220 pounds at your heaviest.

460
00:11:50.771 --> 00:11:51.360
Right.

461
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:51.741
I was,

462
00:11:51.741 --> 00:11:52.260
um,

463
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:52.570
at,

464
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.100
at the fight I was under

465
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.731
<v 4>210.</v>

466
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:55.541
It was 200 and over.

467
00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:59.140
I literally had to drink water at the way in to make two or three because

468
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:00.690
otherwise I said it's not going to be a title fight.

469
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.091
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

470
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:02.400
You had to be above the,

471
00:12:02.401 --> 00:12:05.130
the light heavyweight limit was two or three at 1.2,

472
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:05.993
100,

473
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.240
two or three in Japan.

474
00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:07.451
Right?

475
00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:08.100
Pride.

476
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.560
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

477
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.190
Call A,

478
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.360
they called it middleweight though.

479
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.340
It's what is that?

480
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:15.130
That is 93 kilos I believe is two or three.

481
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.040
Yeah.

482
00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.873
Or 91.

483
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.270
So you are a small heavyweight man.

484
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:20.210
You know,

485
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:23.430
at that time that a and h you could get away with it nowadays,

486
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:23.651
you know,

487
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:25.180
I would find it to a five because it's very,

488
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:25.381
I'm,

489
00:12:25.381 --> 00:12:26.840
I'm already walking around almost the two,

490
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:27.080
five.

491
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.790
But at that time you fought,

492
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.000
I liked the word heavyweight title much better.

493
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.950
And the world he's made guys,

494
00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:34.060
when you beat up the list,

495
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.481
you know,

496
00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:34.980
the big,

497
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.813
big guy,

498
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:36.401
uh,

499
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:38.650
you only had to survive there for like four minutes.

500
00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.720
If they brought an onslaught and,

501
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.320
and then,

502
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:41.531
you know,

503
00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:42.520
it was smooth sailing from there.

504
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:42.701
You know,

505
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:43.031
you could,

506
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:43.480
uh,

507
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.190
where am I done?

508
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:44.461
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

509
00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:44.691
To,

510
00:12:44.691 --> 00:12:46.230
to a lot of mixed martial arts fans.

511
00:12:46.231 --> 00:12:47.130
When you look at the,

512
00:12:47.131 --> 00:12:47.251
uh,

513
00:12:47.251 --> 00:12:48.360
the errors of fighting you,

514
00:12:48.361 --> 00:12:51.660
you certainly brought in and the error of the technical striker into the

515
00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:56.400
heavyweight combat sports cause you and Mari Smith will really like the first

516
00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:58.320
guys and of course he's came after you,

517
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.800
but there were the first guys to,

518
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.161
you know,

519
00:13:02.161 --> 00:13:04.830
to really till this,

520
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.100
it's like have like real technical striking,

521
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:08.910
you know,

522
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.540
not just powerful guys who can knock anybody out because there was always going

523
00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:13.380
to be a lot of those.

524
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.170
But like did you see the Bernard Hopkins fight this weekend?

525
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.411
No,

526
00:13:16.411 --> 00:13:17.010
I did not.

527
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:17.730
Great fight.

528
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.930
He want again want again.

529
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.323
This guy is unbelievable.

530
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.650
What you can learn.

531
00:13:22.651 --> 00:13:26.700
Like anybody who's like interested in any sort of martial art watching that

532
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.150
Bernard Hopkins files,

533
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.390
she knows really good with that.

534
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:30.060
Yep.

535
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.260
His technique is perfect.

536
00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:32.011
His defense,

537
00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:35.370
the way he rolls away from shots and even then he occasionally got hit,

538
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.720
but he knows how to cover up.

539
00:13:36.721 --> 00:13:41.700
He knows how to protect himself and that the technical fighters are always going

540
00:13:41.701 --> 00:13:42.420
to have an edge.

541
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.830
It's not easy to be technical.

542
00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:45.220
The instincts that just to go,

543
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.170
ah,

544
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.250
go crazy and attack,

545
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.520
but there's gotta be a method to your madness and that's what separates the men

546
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.140
from the great men,

547
00:13:52.141 --> 00:13:52.590
from,

548
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:53.423
you know the other fighters.

549
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:53.750
<v 4>Well,</v>

550
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.230
you were talking about Barbara Schmidt and I have to tell this really funny

551
00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:58.500
story real fast because I fought him twice actually in,

552
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:02.140
in pancreas and it was just one time I kicked him in the head and I go,

553
00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:02.231
oh,

554
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:02.741
this is easy.

555
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:03.940
I made a switch kick,

556
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.720
but I slipped and I fell on the ground and he wants to jump on top of me and I

557
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:07.931
go,

558
00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:08.131
wait,

559
00:14:08.131 --> 00:14:08.920
wait.

560
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.780
And he stopped and I get up and I go,

561
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:11.614
thank you.

562
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.820
It's just that stop.

563
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:15.011
Yeah.

564
00:14:15.011 --> 00:14:15.940
You told me this before,

565
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.070
that was unbelievably ridiculous.

566
00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:18.940
You hypnotize them.

567
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.280
That's a use Jedi mind tricks.

568
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:22.241
Timeout.

569
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:22.720
Timeout.

570
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.553
Wait one second.

571
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:29.110
<v 0>You were having some back pains as far back as the [inaudible],</v>

572
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:29.970
<v 4>right?</v>

573
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:30.481
Yeah.

574
00:14:30.481 --> 00:14:31.680
It all started there,

575
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:32.603
you know,

576
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.500
six weeks before the CACHACA fired,

577
00:14:34.501 --> 00:14:38.220
I had Dell Goler the wrestler and I'm in a triangle choke,

578
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.670
and he thought it was smart to lift me up and slammed me down and he slammed me

579
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.580
with my head against a wall in the corner.

580
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.760
And that really did some damage to me.

581
00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:48.031
You know,

582
00:14:48.031 --> 00:14:48.161
I,

583
00:14:48.161 --> 00:14:49.200
I had a baby at the time,

584
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:50.370
she couldn't even lay on my chest.

585
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.750
I couldn't breathe,

586
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.490
couldn't cough,

587
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:52.791
you know,

588
00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:53.021
and I,

589
00:14:53.021 --> 00:14:54.210
I brought that a hole,

590
00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.400
that thing with me too.

591
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:57.110
The Randleman fight as well,

592
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:57.920
you know.

593
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.401
But you know,

594
00:14:58.401 --> 00:15:01.640
once they put me on the posters and they introduced me like world's greatest

595
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:02.090
more stores,

596
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.510
I don't know.

597
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.440
I can't say no.

598
00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:04.700
Now I gotta I gotta do this thing,

599
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.331
you know.

600
00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:05.661
So I,

601
00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:05.871
uh,

602
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:07.790
I remember I was in the dressing room.

603
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:12.790
I had this big a syringe with Lidocaine and I was injecting myself in between my

604
00:15:13.941 --> 00:15:14.241
ribs.

605
00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:18.110
And then the camera crew came in and they see me and it was at the time,

606
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:23.111
I believe with universal soldiers and they see me ejecting and they turned

607
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:23.750
around,

608
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.391
they ran out,

609
00:15:24.391 --> 00:15:25.520
they thought I was doing something illegal.

610
00:15:25.521 --> 00:15:25.701
I said,

611
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:25.941
dude,

612
00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:28.850
I'm just putting a lot of gain in a year because it was so painful.

613
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.070
So this is when you were about to fight,

614
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.170
you were pumping yourself full with Lidacain?

615
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:33.660
Yeah.

616
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.493
In between the ribs.

617
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.571
You,

618
00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:35.990
um,

619
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.280
did you ever get an Mri for that?

620
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.270
Find out what that was?

621
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:38.780
No,

622
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.380
that just,

623
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.000
it just went away after years,

624
00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:42.620
took a long time to sleep,

625
00:15:42.621 --> 00:15:42.861
just,

626
00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:46.100
I took a lot of sleep medication at the time because it would hurt during sleep.

627
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:46.791
Yeah.

628
00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:49.540
You probably had a bulging disc or something or a herniated,

629
00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.230
a lot of policy disco,

630
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:51.501
you know,

631
00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:54.500
I just had neck surgery two years ago and then I now had it again,

632
00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:55.640
uh,

633
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.580
early this year and now they fused three discs together.

634
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.230
Now was finally like yesterday.

635
00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:00.411
They,

636
00:16:00.411 --> 00:16:01.280
before it started,

637
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.890
I feel slightly slowly lift my arm.

638
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:05.330
She has a whole dent in here.

639
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:05.991
Yeah.

640
00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:06.561
See and hear,

641
00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:08.630
it's all gone and it's really weird.

642
00:16:08.631 --> 00:16:09.411
All those muscles,

643
00:16:09.411 --> 00:16:11.130
they have to start refiring so to say.

644
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.950
And so it's cause the nerves were cut off.

645
00:16:12.951 --> 00:16:14.170
They were pinched binders.

646
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.013
Herniation,

647
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:15.900
yeah.

648
00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.701
Lost complete power,

649
00:16:16.701 --> 00:16:16.911
man.

650
00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:17.271
That's a,

651
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:20.090
it's a scary thing when you can grab the milk out of the fridge anymore,

652
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.200
you know?

653
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.510
And especially if you're used to doing 100 pull ups,

654
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:24.291
you know,

655
00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:24.681
so,

656
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:25.040
uh,

657
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.291
yeah,

658
00:16:25.291 --> 00:16:25.531
that,

659
00:16:25.531 --> 00:16:25.880
that,

660
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.750
that kind of scare me.

661
00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:26.991
So,

662
00:16:26.991 --> 00:16:27.670
but now we're,

663
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.540
we're back on track and hopefully it comes back.

664
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.460
So you got three discs fused,

665
00:16:31.461 --> 00:16:33.260
so upper and lower to one,

666
00:16:33.261 --> 00:16:34.490
so it's three in a row,

667
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:34.911
three in a row,

668
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:35.091
five,

669
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:35.900
six and seven.

670
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.470
And um,

671
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:37.340
is that an issue?

672
00:16:37.341 --> 00:16:41.060
And putting pressure on the discs above it and below it will,

673
00:16:41.061 --> 00:16:43.130
it will happen for especially the one below it,

674
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:43.521
you know,

675
00:16:43.521 --> 00:16:44.750
that's what they already want me for.

676
00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:45.640
But like my,

677
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.090
my mobility is the same.

678
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:48.860
I was amazed when I came out because they told me,

679
00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:49.071
you know,

680
00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:50.510
three districts a big deal and,

681
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:51.500
but I,

682
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.440
I don't feel any different than I was before.

683
00:16:54.441 --> 00:16:55.540
So That's interesting.

684
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.030
Yeah.

685
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.450
So you probably were hindered in your mobility anyway because your disc issue.

686
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.380
That's probably the case.

687
00:17:00.381 --> 00:17:01.040
Yeah.

688
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.410
I'm going through a little bit of a halt.

689
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.460
<v 0>That's great now too,</v>

690
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.200
but I don't have any numbness or anything,

691
00:17:05.201 --> 00:17:06.460
but I'll be getting it treated.

692
00:17:06.461 --> 00:17:10.240
I've been getting rolfing done and I'm getting spinal decompression and they put

693
00:17:10.241 --> 00:17:11.800
you in a machine and stretch you out

694
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.531
<v 4>golfing.</v>

695
00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:13.730
Last week I had that down,

696
00:17:13.731 --> 00:17:15.420
but his old lady that comes in and a,

697
00:17:15.421 --> 00:17:16.520
it just kills me.

698
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:18.020
Terrorized body.

699
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.060
It's amazing.

700
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:19.791
It's painful,

701
00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:20.390
right?

702
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.751
<v 0>It is.</v>

703
00:17:20.751 --> 00:17:23.540
And you know when it really fascinating conversation I had with this a woman

704
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:26.930
yesterday who is a chiropractor who told me you would be surprised,

705
00:17:26.931 --> 00:17:29.420
like people take a anti-inflammatories,

706
00:17:29.421 --> 00:17:31.670
but how much of um,

707
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:37.030
how much you can do with food just by eating a resveratrol.

708
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.020
I'm cutting out all your wheat and cutting out pasta and gluten and all that

709
00:17:42.021 --> 00:17:42.680
crap.

710
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.070
She's like,

711
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.580
you would,

712
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.150
you would decrease your inflammation so much from all that stuff.

713
00:17:47.151 --> 00:17:48.800
Like we don't understand that we have,

714
00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:52.170
like we have very powerful immune systems for the most part and we're constantly

715
00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.040
fighting things off.

716
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:54.690
But your body is using,

717
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:59.691
your body is fighting off like inflammation all the time and it's better.

718
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.620
It's better at doing it when it's not being poisoned and when your body doesn't

719
00:18:04.621 --> 00:18:05.910
have wheat to deal with,

720
00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:07.440
like we don't think about it,

721
00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:08.820
but pasta and bread,

722
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:09.900
all that delicious stuff,

723
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.310
it was fucking terrible for you.

724
00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:11.850
It's like,

725
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:12.900
it's basically sugar.

726
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.940
It's just as sloppy gooey fucking nonsense that your body's not really supposed

727
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:18.774
to be eating.

728
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:23.840
And then she was going on and on about [inaudible] and resveratrol and all these

729
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:24.984
different uh,

730
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.630
antioxidants and eating a clean,

731
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:29.220
much more like Paleo Diet.

732
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.100
<v 5>I'm trying,</v>

733
00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.430
I'm trying actually gluten free more now.

734
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.331
More often.

735
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:35.530
Not completely because as well.

736
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.433
Yeah.

737
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:37.231
But uh,

738
00:18:37.231 --> 00:18:37.471
you know,

739
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:38.910
I same breakfast,

740
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.890
a shitty breakfast all the time.

741
00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:42.060
I had this brown rice,

742
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:46.200
Craig Brown rice with the hot water and honey and I've been eating them for the

743
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.690
last years because he's the only foot I otherwise I don't eat till like four

744
00:18:48.691 --> 00:18:49.524
o'clock.

745
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.740
I am not hungry during the day at force myself to drink this thing.

746
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:55.830
And then when the in my stomach I get hungry and are now,

747
00:18:55.831 --> 00:18:58.170
actually I just ate a Burrito just before I came here,

748
00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.640
which is amazing for me

749
00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:00.820
<v 0>because normally I never eat.</v>

750
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.200
So you really have been,

751
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.850
is this because of your injury?

752
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:04.561
<v 5>No,</v>

753
00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:04.681
no,

754
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:04.830
no.

755
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.840
I had my whole life had that,

756
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:07.111
you know,

757
00:19:07.111 --> 00:19:07.944
I will wake up,

758
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.860
same brand and everything with me if it works and never change it.

759
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:11.851
Like I have to strain,

760
00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:13.110
same stretching routine.

761
00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.220
I was talking about it last time,

762
00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:17.070
but I'll share the same food when I think my whole career,

763
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.490
I eight six slices of bread in the morning with like a,

764
00:19:20.491 --> 00:19:23.170
a marmalade jelly on it though because I believe that the peel,

765
00:19:23.171 --> 00:19:23.911
the orange peel,

766
00:19:23.911 --> 00:19:24.541
you know that it,

767
00:19:24.541 --> 00:19:24.840
uh,

768
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.940
stopped lactic acid from getting into your muscles.

769
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.630
And I always had that feeling with it as sometimes I edit peanut butter and that

770
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.560
was my breakfast.

771
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.880
And when I say that,

772
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.690
that means my entire career I would do the same thing and we'll wake up very

773
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:37.111
early,

774
00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:38.310
two hours before my workout,

775
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.000
eat,

776
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.960
go back to sleep.

777
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.860
And then when I would wake up and will be digested and I was not training.

778
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.120
Wow.

779
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.460
But that's not like what I mean.

780
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.090
Nutritionist would ever tell you no,

781
00:19:48.091 --> 00:19:48.201
no,

782
00:19:48.201 --> 00:19:48.390
no.

783
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.091
The best thing I,

784
00:19:49.091 --> 00:19:50.200
you know Ryan Parson,

785
00:19:50.201 --> 00:19:51.030
she know he was a,

786
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.790
with me with my last fight when I was training together with Kevin,

787
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.210
Kevin,

788
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:54.421
Kevin,

789
00:19:54.421 --> 00:19:54.610
Jim,

790
00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.240
she was there all the time for real because they said,

791
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.361
oh,

792
00:19:57.361 --> 00:19:58.260
it's a publicity stunt.

793
00:19:58.261 --> 00:19:58.891
Him in the corner high.

794
00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:01.710
He was a pretty much every day helping me training,

795
00:20:01.711 --> 00:20:02.544
shouting,

796
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.833
screaming,

797
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.850
and Ryan Parsons where the last fight,

798
00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:06.600
when you see me,

799
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.950
I look the best I've ever looked.

800
00:20:07.951 --> 00:20:08.160
I go,

801
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:08.640
my God,

802
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:08.911
you know,

803
00:20:08.911 --> 00:20:09.744
this is,

804
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.780
but it was just because that was the first time in my life.

805
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.430
I had a diet.

806
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.660
I ate like six,

807
00:20:15.661 --> 00:20:16.980
seven times a day.

808
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.120
Small portions,

809
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:18.571
fish,

810
00:20:18.571 --> 00:20:19.020
chicken,

811
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.321
rice,

812
00:20:19.321 --> 00:20:19.680
all that,

813
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.090
all that stuff that I never did.

814
00:20:21.091 --> 00:20:22.980
I ate pizza and steaks and beer.

815
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:23.671
You know,

816
00:20:23.671 --> 00:20:24.660
when I was competing,

817
00:20:24.661 --> 00:20:24.841
I,

818
00:20:24.841 --> 00:20:26.070
that just worked for me.

819
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:26.881
So again,

820
00:20:26.881 --> 00:20:30.120
why would I break a windrow money or why you were in training camp?

821
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:30.501
Yeah.

822
00:20:30.501 --> 00:20:30.660
I,

823
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.081
you know,

824
00:20:31.081 --> 00:20:32.310
actually in a home in Japan,

825
00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:32.881
you done and stuff.

826
00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:35.100
When you go from Holland to Japan,

827
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:35.701
there's an a,

828
00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:36.930
an a a time difference,

829
00:20:36.931 --> 00:20:39.990
which is daytime is nighttime for you.

830
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:40.320
Right?

831
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.880
So that means you're awake all night and around seven o'clock at night in the

832
00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:45.480
morning,

833
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.620
that in becomes 11 o'clock at in your,

834
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:48.100
where you come

835
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.790
<v 4>from,</v>

836
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.990
you're going to start falling asleep.

837
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:52.270
So I go after the first two fights.

838
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.370
I don't want to take sleeping pills because I'm going to compete at the,

839
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.670
I've always figured like a medication slows me down.

840
00:20:57.671 --> 00:20:57.980
And I said,

841
00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.140
I always stayed away from that.

842
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.011
But then I say,

843
00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:00.260
you know,

844
00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.093
let's go out.

845
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.440
We've got great Rappongi here and we'd drink a couple of beers and it worked,

846
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.801
you know,

847
00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:07.660
I will come home and fall asleep and uh,

848
00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:08.590
that became my,

849
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.121
you know,

850
00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:10.954
how you saying my,

851
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.280
my schedule became your,

852
00:21:12.281 --> 00:21:15.130
before the fight I would just go out and get a couple of beers and then fuck how

853
00:21:15.131 --> 00:21:15.641
many beers?

854
00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:16.474
Three.

855
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.343
Five,

856
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.700
yeah.

857
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.560
Five beers before a fight.

858
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.270
You know your in all of it.

859
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:22.751
So what you,

860
00:21:22.751 --> 00:21:23.950
you kind of used to that,

861
00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:24.191
you know,

862
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:24.370
in,

863
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.330
in the evening you're drinking,

864
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.930
you're doing just in the and a what is a Germany?

865
00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:31.360
They actually in the army they drink during the day.

866
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.090
There's people that own the arm.

867
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.381
Yeah.

868
00:21:33.381 --> 00:21:35.930
The LEWITT Lieutenant Society and Shit Explains

869
00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:36.973
<v 0>Hitler.</v>

870
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.660
They were hammered.

871
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:41.603
It made sense.

872
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.600
That's hilarious.

873
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.460
So whether they just drink a beer with lunch or something,

874
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:45.101
<v 4>I guess.</v>

875
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:45.331
Yeah.

876
00:21:45.331 --> 00:21:45.461
Yeah.

877
00:21:45.461 --> 00:21:46.270
No they do.

878
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:46.601
You know,

879
00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:47.381
I was at a training,

880
00:21:47.381 --> 00:21:48.520
a d elite special forces.

881
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:50.560
They did the same thing during the day they drink beer.

882
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.750
<v 0>Wow.</v>

883
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:52.351
That's crazy.

884
00:21:52.351 --> 00:21:54.900
I never would have thought that that would ever happen in the army.

885
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.540
When know some places the,

886
00:21:57.541 --> 00:21:59.520
it's common that you drink wine with lunch.

887
00:21:59.521 --> 00:22:00.360
Like in France.

888
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.530
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

889
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.570
Ingres I had Larry Papadopoulos with me.

890
00:22:03.571 --> 00:22:03.871
He would,

891
00:22:03.871 --> 00:22:08.370
every morning he had a his port with him and he would drink a glass of port

892
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.233
every morning.

893
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:09.691
Yeah.

894
00:22:09.691 --> 00:22:10.680
Like a half a glass,

895
00:22:10.681 --> 00:22:10.921
you know,

896
00:22:10.921 --> 00:22:12.510
he said it will fight all the,

897
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.950
what do your immune system,

898
00:22:13.951 --> 00:22:14.701
it's good for that.

899
00:22:14.701 --> 00:22:15.880
And so

900
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:17.520
<v 0>he just likes beer.</v>

901
00:22:17.521 --> 00:22:18.280
That mother fucker.

902
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:18.770
Yeah.

903
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.070
Likes to get a kick in the money.

904
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.420
That's crazy.

905
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.111
So,

906
00:22:22.111 --> 00:22:22.440
um,

907
00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.460
that's the,

908
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.901
you've,

909
00:22:23.901 --> 00:22:25.440
we were afraid of sleeping pills,

910
00:22:25.441 --> 00:22:27.780
but you weren't afraid of the repercussions of alcohol?

911
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:28.680
<v 4>No.</v>

912
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:28.861
No,

913
00:22:28.861 --> 00:22:30.600
because it doesn't do anything.

914
00:22:30.601 --> 00:22:31.680
I believe it's natural.

915
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.970
Right.

916
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:33.150
I wouldn't get tanked,

917
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.660
but I have moments that when I would,

918
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.330
but the stare down and it,

919
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.181
which I never did.

920
00:22:39.181 --> 00:22:39.510
I,

921
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.841
you know,

922
00:22:39.841 --> 00:22:42.750
only when they tried to intimidate me then I will put it on in them,

923
00:22:42.751 --> 00:22:43.021
you know?

924
00:22:43.021 --> 00:22:43.201
But,

925
00:22:43.201 --> 00:22:43.800
uh,

926
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.940
otherwise we'll just look down.

927
00:22:44.941 --> 00:22:45.450
But I,

928
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:46.020
I,

929
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:50.650
I knew they would smell like the food is coming from your month ago.

930
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:51.450
Like,

931
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.410
this guy is crazy.

932
00:22:52.411 --> 00:22:52.890
You know?

933
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.150
I always thought actually,

934
00:22:54.151 --> 00:22:56.370
because at the end they didn't do it anymore because it was finding here in

935
00:22:56.371 --> 00:22:59.040
America and I didn't need it because I'm falling asleep,

936
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.353
but I was thought,

937
00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:00.841
you know,

938
00:23:00.841 --> 00:23:01.770
to go to the,

939
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.800
to be for just before you go to the center of the cage,

940
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.510
flushed with whiskey in your mouth,

941
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.040
spit out to go to him and then let them think that you're hammered,

942
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:11.641
you know,

943
00:23:11.641 --> 00:23:13.200
just to get inside their heads.

944
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.571
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

945
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:16.030
There's some guys that show up in Jujitsu class drunk.

946
00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:16.901
There's this one dude,

947
00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:18.250
he used to be drunk all the time.

948
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:18.911
We'd roll with them.

949
00:23:18.911 --> 00:23:19.121
You know,

950
00:23:19.121 --> 00:23:19.990
he smelled a whiskey.

951
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.351
Well,

952
00:23:20.351 --> 00:23:21.250
there's a lot of guys stone,

953
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.113
right?

954
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:27.850
So different though in that stone doesn't fuck with your reflexes.

955
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.480
Not to me.

956
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:28.920
These,

957
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.441
it doesn't,

958
00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:31.030
does it fuck with my reaction time?

959
00:23:31.031 --> 00:23:33.640
I actually feel like I'm probably better at Jiu Jitsu when I'm high.

960
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.350
I guys feel like that.

961
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.610
That's why so many of them rolls,

962
00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:36.890
roll,

963
00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:37.723
stoned,

964
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:38.510
you know,

965
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.251
get more creative.

966
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:39.610
Alter.

967
00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.110
I actually come up with more stuff.

968
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:41.531
Yeah.

969
00:23:41.531 --> 00:23:42.130
More creative,

970
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:42.941
more relaxed,

971
00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:44.950
more completely focused on what you're doing.

972
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.040
They say that it's easier

973
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.873
<v 2>to get into it,</v>

974
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.020
you know,

975
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:48.390
wouldn't,

976
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:49.221
wouldn't work for me.

977
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:50.000
I'm a plant,

978
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:50.721
one of those guys.

979
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:51.321
If I do it,

980
00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:53.960
I'm sitting in a meeting and there's no,

981
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.280
you ask me two questions.

982
00:23:55.281 --> 00:23:56.114
Hey boss,

983
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:56.983
what's your,

984
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.720
what's your Christian and everybody Christian names and where you were born.

985
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.560
I go out,

986
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.080
Sebastian and they will all was the other question.

987
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:03.330
You know,

988
00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:03.450
I,

989
00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.191
I literally,

990
00:24:04.191 --> 00:24:05.360
my friends would laugh.

991
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:07.070
I'd five second memory.

992
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.293
It's amazing.

993
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:09.800
While everybody's different.

994
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:11.990
So when you were,

995
00:24:11.991 --> 00:24:13.460
when you were competing,

996
00:24:13.461 --> 00:24:14.031
so no,

997
00:24:14.031 --> 00:24:15.440
we'd even though you live in Holland.

998
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:15.981
No,

999
00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:16.371
never.

1000
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:16.641
Never.

1001
00:24:16.641 --> 00:24:18.010
It was never my daughter.

1002
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:18.651
I smoke weed.

1003
00:24:18.651 --> 00:24:19.484
Isn't that funny?

1004
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.140
You know it is because it's not,

1005
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.370
it's not taboo.

1006
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:23.271
It's not taboo.

1007
00:24:23.271 --> 00:24:23.511
You know,

1008
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:24.520
it's like drinking age.

1009
00:24:24.521 --> 00:24:25.281
You don't have in holiday,

1010
00:24:25.281 --> 00:24:26.210
I think you'd now have,

1011
00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:27.530
it's maybe 14 or something,

1012
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:28.561
but you never,

1013
00:24:28.561 --> 00:24:29.630
he never had a drinking age.

1014
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.860
But all these kids,

1015
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:31.730
they are not going to say,

1016
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:31.911
hey,

1017
00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:33.290
I want to drink because it's cool.

1018
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:33.521
You know,

1019
00:24:33.521 --> 00:24:34.600
because it is not cool.

1020
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.440
And 12 year old and 14 year old kid can do it.

1021
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:37.220
Right.

1022
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:37.521
Yeah.

1023
00:24:37.521 --> 00:24:38.320
It's no big deal.

1024
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:38.470
Yeah.

1025
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:39.560
That's just a part of life.

1026
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:40.011
Yeah.

1027
00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:40.701
12 year old,

1028
00:24:40.701 --> 00:24:41.540
13 year old kid.

1029
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.441
Holy Shit.

1030
00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:43.310
That's hilarious.

1031
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.810
I wasn't,

1032
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:44.220
I was,

1033
00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.160
I was in America and a half a year and then I went back to Holland to,

1034
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.950
to visit the family and it was looking at an a,

1035
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:50.780
they call it the puppet care,

1036
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:51.850
whatever theater.

1037
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:52.820
This is the two,

1038
00:24:52.821 --> 00:24:57.821
two little curtains open up and there are people from haulers are everywhere and

1039
00:24:58.941 --> 00:25:00.950
from the country and they can say whatever.

1040
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.030
Whatever's on their mind.

1041
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.850
And there were two little kids sitting there with a,

1042
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.590
with a bottle of wine again.

1043
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.873
And they said,

1044
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.060
yeah,

1045
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:10.250
we like to drink beer.

1046
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:10.941
And they were drinking.

1047
00:25:10.941 --> 00:25:12.150
And I look at my wife and I go,

1048
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.680
Ooh,

1049
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.250
matches.

1050
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.580
This happens in America where people are going to say it's insane.

1051
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:16.911
I mean,

1052
00:25:16.911 --> 00:25:20.390
there were six or eight years old and they were drinking a beer.

1053
00:25:20.391 --> 00:25:20.631
Yeah.

1054
00:25:20.631 --> 00:25:21.141
My parents,

1055
00:25:21.141 --> 00:25:21.420
you know,

1056
00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.850
order not really against it.

1057
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.481
I go,

1058
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:24.021
Whoa,

1059
00:25:24.021 --> 00:25:24.440
dude.

1060
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.120
And then the curtain closed again.

1061
00:25:26.121 --> 00:25:27.020
It was the wireless thing.

1062
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.420
Imagine at Strip clubs and the girls are wearing bibs.

1063
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.541
Well,

1064
00:25:29.541 --> 00:25:30.380
they don't have strip clubs.

1065
00:25:30.381 --> 00:25:31.214
They have whorehouses.

1066
00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:31.730
Right?

1067
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.971
Yeah.

1068
00:25:31.971 --> 00:25:32.181
I mean,

1069
00:25:32.181 --> 00:25:35.650
Holland is a totally different thing to have a whole area where it's all whore,

1070
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:35.850
whore.

1071
00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:36.650
Whorehouses right?

1072
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:37.070
Yeah,

1073
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.281
yeah,

1074
00:25:37.281 --> 00:25:37.440
yeah.

1075
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.121
The Red Light district,

1076
00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:38.211
hey,

1077
00:25:38.211 --> 00:25:38.430
yes.

1078
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.160
That pretty much every town you have,

1079
00:25:40.161 --> 00:25:40.791
the red led to stick,

1080
00:25:40.791 --> 00:25:41.810
not only in Amsterdam.

1081
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:42.351
I mean,

1082
00:25:42.351 --> 00:25:43.370
think about that for a second.

1083
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.840
Not a whorehouse.

1084
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:45.171
No.

1085
00:25:45.171 --> 00:25:46.340
A whore neighborhood.

1086
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.500
They got a whole hoard neighborhood.

1087
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:49.620
Yeah.

1088
00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:54.130
Windowshopping incidences of HIV and all of Europe and Lois,

1089
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.700
incidents of heroin addiction,

1090
00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.110
which is really crazy.

1091
00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.310
They all get tested.

1092
00:25:58.550 --> 00:25:59.830
They all need to be legal there.

1093
00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:00.681
There's a lot of testing.

1094
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:01.000
They're going,

1095
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:01.470
yeah.

1096
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.790
You know,

1097
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:02.511
and you'll be amazed.

1098
00:26:02.511 --> 00:26:03.740
You walk there like if the red,

1099
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:08.360
the red light district in Amsterdam and you see girls that you go like,

1100
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.841
you know,

1101
00:26:08.841 --> 00:26:09.890
there could be the girl next door.

1102
00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:10.701
It's amazing.

1103
00:26:10.701 --> 00:26:15.701
The amount of different plethora as though about Berwyn say oh girls that they

1104
00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:19.670
have and it's not the s w they wouldn't even think about it the same way we

1105
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:20.420
think about it.

1106
00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.253
Like the,

1107
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:25.760
the way life is there from the get go is so much different than the way life is

1108
00:26:25.761 --> 00:26:26.360
here.

1109
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.890
That in my opinion,

1110
00:26:27.891 --> 00:26:28.281
like to,

1111
00:26:28.281 --> 00:26:28.491
to,

1112
00:26:28.491 --> 00:26:32.350
to change our laws and to make it so that prostitution's legal and make some

1113
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.670
marijuana just openly tolerated everywhere.

1114
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.220
And kids can drink at 12 like,

1115
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:37.791
man,

1116
00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:39.410
you would almost have to start from scratch.

1117
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:39.681
Yeah.

1118
00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:40.514
You have to.

1119
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:41.181
It's a,

1120
00:26:41.181 --> 00:26:41.900
and it's a Ma,

1121
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:42.980
like I couldn't do it.

1122
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.160
If you go to the red light districts,

1123
00:26:44.161 --> 00:26:48.610
sometimes you see like eight guys in a row waiting in front of one SPEC windows.

1124
00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.453
She's hot.

1125
00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:52.070
Fucking imagine the guy comes out,

1126
00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:52.321
he is,

1127
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:53.900
he like an ugly dude giving get it done.

1128
00:26:53.901 --> 00:26:54.780
Then you get to go in,

1129
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:55.561
you know,

1130
00:26:55.561 --> 00:26:56.280
it's not for me,

1131
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.730
it's like don't get Sushi on Sundays and go to a Korean spa at nine o'clock at

1132
00:26:59.731 --> 00:27:00.564
night.

1133
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:01.853
It's a Bra.

1134
00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.330
Yeah,

1135
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.160
it seems like Holland.

1136
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:08.730
It's all it all just more laid back.

1137
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.110
More fun.

1138
00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.520
Wilder people.

1139
00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:12.240
Right?

1140
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:12.841
Like big,

1141
00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:14.340
big kickboxing scene.

1142
00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:15.540
Huge kickboxing scene.

1143
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.321
You know,

1144
00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:16.800
I was,

1145
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.380
I was just watching today on Facebook.

1146
00:27:19.381 --> 00:27:23.940
Somebody posted the Magiro gym on my Facebook from 83 there was,

1147
00:27:23.941 --> 00:27:25.230
when Andre Barilla Mun,

1148
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:26.250
we're still alive.

1149
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.350
You know the guy who got killed and tortured.

1150
00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.500
There's a big story and hall.

1151
00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.120
It was a phenomenal kickbox.

1152
00:27:31.121 --> 00:27:31.321
And you,

1153
00:27:31.321 --> 00:27:33.480
so rob came on mil of oil globally.

1154
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:34.440
I mean,

1155
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.273
Fred royals,

1156
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:38.610
the eight guys from that gym roll world champions.

1157
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.900
I mean they went to Thailand,

1158
00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:40.501
beat the thighs.

1159
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:40.951
It wasn't saying.

1160
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:44.910
I went to a show at the op Ada Holland Holland where there were four world title

1161
00:27:44.911 --> 00:27:49.560
fights and they broadcast it a life to Thailand and the best Thai boxers came

1162
00:27:49.561 --> 00:27:53.010
down and there was like [inaudible] and core.

1163
00:27:53.011 --> 00:27:55.590
Rob came and all these guys and we won four out of four.

1164
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:56.640
They're not these guys out.

1165
00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:57.660
It was the craziest thing.

1166
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.550
It never happened after that again.

1167
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.970
Well the Dutch style incorporated a lot more striking with the hands.

1168
00:28:02.971 --> 00:28:03.360
Right.

1169
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.800
It's a lot more boxing technique.

1170
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:05.261
That's it.

1171
00:28:05.261 --> 00:28:06.840
Tie again tying it together.

1172
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.420
That's I think the biggest and it has great hands.

1173
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.200
Everybody has great hands there and the,

1174
00:28:11.201 --> 00:28:15.540
the Dutch style of a striking is really like to the lay person.

1175
00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:16.950
It looks like you just kicking and punching,

1176
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:17.541
but the,

1177
00:28:17.541 --> 00:28:17.840
the,

1178
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.500
the technical aspects of it,

1179
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:21.780
like I've taken some classes with rob came in before,

1180
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.720
the way he breaks things down in there,

1181
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.180
like patterns and how to follow these paths.

1182
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.130
He's got like these automatic patterns that he does.

1183
00:28:29.131 --> 00:28:30.330
Like when your foot is here,

1184
00:28:30.331 --> 00:28:30.991
he's doing this.

1185
00:28:30.991 --> 00:28:31.781
When his arm is here,

1186
00:28:31.781 --> 00:28:32.550
he's doing that.

1187
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:35.370
He hits with the left hook and then it's the right leg kick and he's got like

1188
00:28:35.371 --> 00:28:36.030
this,

1189
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:36.301
you know,

1190
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:39.870
this really technical system that when you seem sparring,

1191
00:28:39.871 --> 00:28:42.150
it's really fascinating to watch it in action.

1192
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:42.511
Yeah,

1193
00:28:42.511 --> 00:28:45.810
because he just taught himself to do it all the time.

1194
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.740
Like when I,

1195
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.390
when I hold focus Mitts for my guys,

1196
00:28:48.391 --> 00:28:53.000
I have shin pads on myself and out of the blue I kick and I'll do an admit

1197
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:53.760
combination.

1198
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.060
Whenever they don't expect it and they got whatever left Geeky counters with the

1199
00:28:57.061 --> 00:28:57.511
cross hook,

1200
00:28:57.511 --> 00:28:59.370
locate any other kind of who cross low kick,

1201
00:28:59.640 --> 00:28:59.880
you know?

1202
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.110
And then we changed the combination,

1203
00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:01.591
right buddy,

1204
00:29:01.591 --> 00:29:02.370
left hook,

1205
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:03.330
low kick or you know,

1206
00:29:03.331 --> 00:29:03.991
or left hook,

1207
00:29:03.991 --> 00:29:04.501
right body,

1208
00:29:04.501 --> 00:29:04.881
you know,

1209
00:29:04.881 --> 00:29:06.000
and liver shot.

1210
00:29:06.001 --> 00:29:06.360
Right?

1211
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.450
I mean ideas but it's all the time them into the head.

1212
00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:11.430
So that in combat at all comes out,

1213
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.320
oh automatically here tech come should bump up their show character and whether

1214
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:15.511
you,

1215
00:29:15.511 --> 00:29:19.320
it's gotta be a started with a body shot and then a hat or a head body or had

1216
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:20.101
had a buddy buddy,

1217
00:29:20.101 --> 00:29:20.910
whatever it is.

1218
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:23.310
That's what people really truly don't understand about.

1219
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.173
Um,

1220
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:25.260
about the,

1221
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:25.501
what,

1222
00:29:25.501 --> 00:29:29.220
it's what's required in order to pull something off under extreme stress.

1223
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:29.630
Yep.

1224
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.850
You know,

1225
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:31.170
we had Sam Sheridan,

1226
00:29:31.171 --> 00:29:31.770
he's uh,

1227
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.300
he wrote that book of fighter's mind.

1228
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.470
If I just have somebody recently talk to me about it,

1229
00:29:36.471 --> 00:29:37.680
you have very good book actually.

1230
00:29:37.681 --> 00:29:37.951
Great.

1231
00:29:37.951 --> 00:29:38.040
He,

1232
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.000
and he's got a great new one out called the disaster diaries and it's all

1233
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
<v 0>about pressure in dealing with natural disaster is horrible situations where</v>

1234
00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:50.910
people's character gets exposed and how to stay calm.

1235
00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.380
And one of the things he's talking about in the book is about like what,

1236
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:55.861
what,

1237
00:29:55.861 --> 00:29:57.840
how your body moves in,

1238
00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:59.790
in a competition and that you,

1239
00:29:59.791 --> 00:30:02.160
the only things that are going to come out,

1240
00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.570
are there things that you've drilled into your brain to the point where they're

1241
00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:07.710
in your subconscious.

1242
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:08.930
So like the,

1243
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.130
the left Hook whizzes by your head.

1244
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.200
The counters right there,

1245
00:30:12.201 --> 00:30:13.410
it's just automatic.

1246
00:30:13.411 --> 00:30:16.290
It has to be automatic because you're not going to have time to think and you're

1247
00:30:16.291 --> 00:30:17.520
going to be flooded with adrenaline.

1248
00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.421
<v 5>I had an a,</v>

1249
00:30:18.421 --> 00:30:19.350
a guy who came to me,

1250
00:30:19.351 --> 00:30:22.200
he actually won the amateur title last weekend to Yens Growl.

1251
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.090
He was 38 years old when he came to me.

1252
00:30:24.091 --> 00:30:26.320
It was 245 pounds as a power lifter,

1253
00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:27.810
and he wanted to train.

1254
00:30:27.811 --> 00:30:28.230
He had to,

1255
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:29.720
he had a torn bicep yet,

1256
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.530
this big bar sticking out of his arm,

1257
00:30:31.531 --> 00:30:31.861
and he said,

1258
00:30:31.861 --> 00:30:32.070
well,

1259
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.731
when do you want to trade?

1260
00:30:32.731 --> 00:30:32.971
He said,

1261
00:30:32.971 --> 00:30:33.480
tomorrow.

1262
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.790
So I grabbed him by the bar and I pulled him to the side and I say,

1263
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:36.871
now really working,

1264
00:30:36.871 --> 00:30:37.471
right then he goes,

1265
00:30:37.471 --> 00:30:37.591
yeah,

1266
00:30:37.591 --> 00:30:37.861
I didn't know,

1267
00:30:37.861 --> 00:30:39.150
but maybe we can start with kicks.

1268
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:39.930
I said,

1269
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:40.321
first of all,

1270
00:30:40.321 --> 00:30:41.220
we got to lose that weight.

1271
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:41.641
I mean,

1272
00:30:41.641 --> 00:30:42.600
this is going to stop you.

1273
00:30:42.601 --> 00:30:43.650
You can't even scratch your back.

1274
00:30:43.651 --> 00:30:44.431
And he started training,

1275
00:30:44.431 --> 00:30:44.731
training,

1276
00:30:44.731 --> 00:30:45.420
training,

1277
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.220
and every time he would ask me,

1278
00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:47.941
boss,

1279
00:30:47.941 --> 00:30:49.320
when you were on the ground and your site much,

1280
00:30:49.321 --> 00:30:50.780
you teach us Denise to the thighs,

1281
00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:51.210
right?

1282
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:51.600
Yeah.

1283
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.140
That's allowed,

1284
00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:52.381
right?

1285
00:30:52.381 --> 00:30:52.680
Yeah.

1286
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:52.861
What?

1287
00:30:52.861 --> 00:30:52.981
Why?

1288
00:30:52.981 --> 00:30:54.090
It's not been anybody doing it.

1289
00:30:54.091 --> 00:30:54.451
I said,

1290
00:30:54.451 --> 00:30:55.021
because they're still,

1291
00:30:55.021 --> 00:30:55.800
but they don't do that.

1292
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.001
I said,

1293
00:30:56.001 --> 00:30:57.000
why wait till you're fighting?

1294
00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:59.250
And then another Chi Asian in a clean,

1295
00:30:59.251 --> 00:31:01.560
she know you can hit the tie stall or elbowed him and yeah,

1296
00:31:01.561 --> 00:31:03.660
why is nobody doing it now or wait until you're fighting,

1297
00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:04.890
you'll find out when you're fighting.

1298
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.050
And every week he came back with another question.

1299
00:31:07.051 --> 00:31:07.470
I say,

1300
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:08.303
just wait.

1301
00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.870
Now I had a few combinations.

1302
00:31:09.871 --> 00:31:10.920
I have combinations.

1303
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:12.440
I give you like three combinations,

1304
00:31:12.441 --> 00:31:13.950
standup attack combinations,

1305
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.380
three up against a wall and an underground.

1306
00:31:16.381 --> 00:31:16.950
Some.

1307
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.080
So there's only six you get.

1308
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:21.240
But when they come back at you,

1309
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.370
almost a guarantee they're going to knock you out.

1310
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.761
You know,

1311
00:31:23.761 --> 00:31:25.590
they're just really solid combination.

1312
00:31:25.591 --> 00:31:29.580
So one of them was an a big hoop net to the spleen,

1313
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.000
but you keep your whole demeanor low and while you,

1314
00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:33.030
and then you're hitting high,

1315
00:31:33.031 --> 00:31:34.590
but everything stays low.

1316
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:38.190
So he thinks it's not a buddy shot now to fight started.

1317
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.120
It was amateur,

1318
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:39.953
so it was,

1319
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.820
it was all over the place and nothing,

1320
00:31:41.821 --> 00:31:42.481
oh my God.

1321
00:31:42.481 --> 00:31:43.470
And his hands went up.

1322
00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.580
But the one thing came back and was the right hook to the body right into it.

1323
00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.060
Then that's how we knocked about and you see and there you see like even in all

1324
00:31:51.061 --> 00:31:51.751
that chaos,

1325
00:31:51.751 --> 00:31:54.030
because I always know that people,

1326
00:31:54.031 --> 00:31:55.980
when when I knocked out my first Tai boxer,

1327
00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:57.480
if they would at the moment of knockout,

1328
00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.550
it would a blind folded me.

1329
00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:02.730
They would've called him 500 guys and then they put my blind full of say,

1330
00:32:02.731 --> 00:32:02.941
okay,

1331
00:32:02.941 --> 00:32:03.390
who?

1332
00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:04.223
Who did you fight?

1333
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.960
I had no clue who I fought it.

1334
00:32:05.961 --> 00:32:06.860
It's like the,

1335
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:10.290
it's a person but you can't judge doesn't have a face.

1336
00:32:10.291 --> 00:32:11.011
It's like Eh,

1337
00:32:11.011 --> 00:32:11.311
you know,

1338
00:32:11.311 --> 00:32:12.420
there's too much going on.

1339
00:32:12.421 --> 00:32:13.770
It's like the first night driving a car,

1340
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:15.750
but once you can channel all that,

1341
00:32:15.751 --> 00:32:18.000
he knows to listen to their corner and doing that stuff,

1342
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.110
then it comes together.

1343
00:32:19.111 --> 00:32:20.730
But at the end it's all panic.

1344
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.310
One combination came back and it happened to knock them out.

1345
00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.060
<v 0>You wouldn't,</v>

1346
00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:24.430
why?

1347
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.350
How do the Dutch figured that out?

1348
00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:30.280
How'd the Dutch figure out to add the hand combinations and the boxing

1349
00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:31.010
combinations?

1350
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:35.770
Because the ties were already using their hands but much less so than they were

1351
00:32:35.771 --> 00:32:36.550
using their legs.

1352
00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:37.510
I have no clue.

1353
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:37.710
I,

1354
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.510
I think just the size of their daddies.

1355
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:39.980
Yeah.

1356
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.320
<v 4>I don't,</v>

1357
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.031
I think just,

1358
00:32:41.031 --> 00:32:41.580
uh,

1359
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.830
it automatically came with him,

1360
00:32:42.831 --> 00:32:43.120
you know,

1361
00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.640
[inaudible] I truly believe it really started at Magiro gym there,

1362
00:32:46.641 --> 00:32:47.001
you know,

1363
00:32:47.001 --> 00:32:48.260
then in which Bob Caymen,

1364
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:49.520
so all those guys there,

1365
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.151
you know,

1366
00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:52.570
and then a Shucker rekey all although Shams manhole,

1367
00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:52.911
you know,

1368
00:32:52.911 --> 00:32:55.160
of core hammers and everybody started coming.

1369
00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:58.490
I recently saw a video from a Roman records when he was 19 years old,

1370
00:32:58.491 --> 00:32:58.731
you know,

1371
00:32:58.731 --> 00:32:59.600
and that was at the time when,

1372
00:32:59.601 --> 00:33:02.240
the first time when I saw him destroying somebody's,

1373
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.351
my buddy told me,

1374
00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:03.621
he says,

1375
00:33:03.621 --> 00:33:04.311
watch this man.

1376
00:33:04.311 --> 00:33:05.091
You're going to freak out.

1377
00:33:05.091 --> 00:33:06.600
And I thought he's going to get killed this kid.

1378
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.240
But he just drilled,

1379
00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:12.230
he gave him a low kick and the guy flies horizontal in the air and he falls.

1380
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:12.981
And I was like,

1381
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:13.491
what?

1382
00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:13.821
I mean,

1383
00:33:13.821 --> 00:33:16.340
you got to see pictures of him when he was giddy.

1384
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:16.611
Yeah.

1385
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:19.460
Ramon Dekkers unfortunately just passed away,

1386
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.810
I think two weeks ago.

1387
00:33:20.811 --> 00:33:20.991
Right.

1388
00:33:20.991 --> 00:33:21.890
You had a 27.

1389
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:22.320
Now.

1390
00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.210
He had,

1391
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.730
apparently it had a heart attack while he was riding his bike.

1392
00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:26.883
Um,

1393
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:28.220
he was amazing.

1394
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:32.540
Amazing guy to watch and you could watch the older fights and then the newer

1395
00:33:32.541 --> 00:33:32.871
fights,

1396
00:33:32.871 --> 00:33:33.320
as you know,

1397
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:33.801
he got older,

1398
00:33:33.801 --> 00:33:34.634
he got thicker,

1399
00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.511
more muscular.

1400
00:33:35.511 --> 00:33:36.041
But you're right.

1401
00:33:36.041 --> 00:33:38.750
In the early days when he first started finding these very,

1402
00:33:38.751 --> 00:33:39.530
very thin,

1403
00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:40.190
he was the,

1404
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:43.370
he was the eye every interview for 25 years.

1405
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:44.091
I've been saying it,

1406
00:33:44.091 --> 00:33:44.924
you know,

1407
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.240
the best striker,

1408
00:33:47.241 --> 00:33:47.541
you know,

1409
00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:48.420
Emma May bloodline,

1410
00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:52.660
she teachers company that wants to do something with me and I'm over them or may

1411
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.110
have a whole show with kickboxing.

1412
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:55.363
And I say no,

1413
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:56.450
you know,

1414
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:57.150
from Holland,

1415
00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.000
you know the,

1416
00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:58.430
that,

1417
00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.100
that you got to go to a Ramon Dekkers Peter,

1418
00:34:01.101 --> 00:34:01.950
it's an as to host.

1419
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:02.803
That's not me.

1420
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.411
You know,

1421
00:34:03.411 --> 00:34:06.800
I'm did Emmi because these guys are just really good,

1422
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.430
you know,

1423
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.671
and I,

1424
00:34:07.671 --> 00:34:10.530
and my whole style was pretty much what decker did.

1425
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:10.960
And I,

1426
00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.100
I took that and I took Mike Tyson,

1427
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:13.761
you know,

1428
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:17.300
because he's the most powerful striker and I that my whole style like that

1429
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:18.620
square up set up square,

1430
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.520
oh you gotta be a smaller target.

1431
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:21.141
All these people,

1432
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:22.400
you're not going to do some apps do it.

1433
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.151
I mean,

1434
00:34:23.151 --> 00:34:23.451
uh,

1435
00:34:23.451 --> 00:34:24.110
that,

1436
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.460
that will stop you from body shots.

1437
00:34:25.461 --> 00:34:26.960
The Tyson never go down to his buddy.

1438
00:34:26.961 --> 00:34:27.201
No,

1439
00:34:27.201 --> 00:34:27.681
he did not,

1440
00:34:27.681 --> 00:34:27.921
you know,

1441
00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:29.510
and he fought against the best people in the world,

1442
00:34:29.511 --> 00:34:32.720
but he knocks people out with a jab because it's not a jap anymore.

1443
00:34:32.721 --> 00:34:34.910
It's a straight punch at the moment when you square up,

1444
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:35.781
you know,

1445
00:34:35.781 --> 00:34:36.440
and uh,

1446
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.670
and that's why I believe that.

1447
00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:41.780
But it was Mike that was Decker's was included in that decker squared up with

1448
00:34:41.781 --> 00:34:42.700
God's also,

1449
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.060
but not as much,

1450
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:44.923
but he didn't know.

1451
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:46.520
Yeah.

1452
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.630
Also have to sprawl.

1453
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:48.201
That was a,

1454
00:34:48.201 --> 00:34:49.220
that was a big difference.

1455
00:34:49.221 --> 00:34:49.370
Right.

1456
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.160
This shifting like watching Bernard Hopkins this weekend,

1457
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.371
I mean,

1458
00:34:52.371 --> 00:34:54.460
he stands totally sideways box.

1459
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:55.303
Unbelievable.

1460
00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.200
And you can't do that in MMA.

1461
00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.460
It's too easy to take you down.

1462
00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:58.780
Yup.

1463
00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.960
And leg kicks to.

1464
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:00.651
Yeah.

1465
00:35:00.651 --> 00:35:01.100
But yeah,

1466
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:01.820
also,

1467
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:02.031
yeah,

1468
00:35:02.031 --> 00:35:02.630
but also,

1469
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.590
I cannot imagine,

1470
00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:04.400
you know,

1471
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.560
Duane Ludwig when he knocked out Deon spillover,

1472
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.420
we knew what the answer was going to do,

1473
00:35:08.421 --> 00:35:10.010
but he spent all the way in one line.

1474
00:35:10.011 --> 00:35:10.940
He's a South Pole.

1475
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.040
If he wants to throw a left of a right hook,

1476
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:14.300
he has to load up.

1477
00:35:14.301 --> 00:35:16.910
So we thought if you write straight,

1478
00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:17.660
that's it.

1479
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.170
Right.

1480
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.760
And you can watch the fight at the moment.

1481
00:35:19.761 --> 00:35:22.040
He doesn't once and drained it and she,

1482
00:35:22.041 --> 00:35:23.960
and do you see Dwayne looking at me like damn,

1483
00:35:23.961 --> 00:35:24.441
I missed that one.

1484
00:35:24.441 --> 00:35:26.030
But right away he does it again.

1485
00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:27.980
And Dwayne Nielsen right away with a straight punch.

1486
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:29.800
Well it's still does.

1487
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.380
How's this vicious technical right hand too?

1488
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:36.180
You know the way he throws it and it's like it's so crisp and that's how he got

1489
00:35:36.181 --> 00:35:36.231
it.

1490
00:35:36.231 --> 00:35:38.130
The fastest knockout ever in the

1491
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:38.970
<v 0>UFC history.</v>

1492
00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.140
<v 5>It's is one of those guys that I have no clue.</v>

1493
00:35:41.141 --> 00:35:42.610
It was just talking to my buddy about it.

1494
00:35:42.611 --> 00:35:44.950
It's like this guy is the nicest guy.

1495
00:35:44.951 --> 00:35:46.690
Does everything right as do drugs,

1496
00:35:46.691 --> 00:35:47.331
isn't drank,

1497
00:35:47.331 --> 00:35:47.690
does it?

1498
00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.650
She knows that Colleen has guy out there for some reason,

1499
00:35:50.651 --> 00:35:54.980
he always has these crazy injuries like you misstep and he breaks his ankle or

1500
00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:56.351
pull out his knee.

1501
00:35:56.351 --> 00:35:56.861
And I always go,

1502
00:35:56.861 --> 00:35:57.694
why is that?

1503
00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:58.301
You know,

1504
00:35:58.301 --> 00:36:00.160
such a good guy deserve so much better.

1505
00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.270
<v 0>It's physical.</v>

1506
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:01.661
It's just,

1507
00:36:01.661 --> 00:36:02.110
you know,

1508
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:02.943
it's life.

1509
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.491
You know,

1510
00:36:03.491 --> 00:36:05.560
you only got so many miles you could put on that car.

1511
00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.513
That's true.

1512
00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.270
After awhile,

1513
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:08.680
ball joints start braking.

1514
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.430
It's a crazy thing when you think about Duane had so many fights,

1515
00:36:12.431 --> 00:36:12.641
you know,

1516
00:36:12.641 --> 00:36:14.500
before he even got to the UFC,

1517
00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:18.580
he had a so many king of the cage fights and you know,

1518
00:36:18.581 --> 00:36:20.200
he had kickboxing bouts.

1519
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.800
You know,

1520
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.530
he won a world title and Moy talk,

1521
00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:22.840
right?

1522
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.470
Yes he did.

1523
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.770
Yeah.

1524
00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:25.420
So that's a lot of wear and tear.

1525
00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.370
A lot of wear and tear on your body.

1526
00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:28.283
You know,

1527
00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:29.081
<v 5>I show,</v>

1528
00:36:29.081 --> 00:36:30.910
I saw Dwayne first time when I did the bus routes.

1529
00:36:30.911 --> 00:36:31.391
Amputation.

1530
00:36:31.391 --> 00:36:31.561
You're like,

1531
00:36:31.561 --> 00:36:32.620
she had a lot of fighters.

1532
00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:33.510
Uh,

1533
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:36.160
nowadays she'll became bigger fighters come from that.

1534
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.410
A tournament that we had.

1535
00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.350
And it was so bad as that one mode.

1536
00:36:41.351 --> 00:36:44.980
You had to fight four times in one night and it was almost no weight classes.

1537
00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:47.700
And they do that recently to glory is a long time.

1538
00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:47.960
Yeah.

1539
00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.070
Uh,

1540
00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:48.903
Gloria does.

1541
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:50.323
It's striking,

1542
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.520
but he,

1543
00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.060
that's where I found Dwayne for the first time he was there and we needed an

1544
00:36:55.061 --> 00:36:57.460
opponent for somebody and a GSL.

1545
00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.110
I'll do it.

1546
00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:02.020
And this little kid jumps up and he finds this guy 30 pound heavier.

1547
00:37:02.021 --> 00:37:03.070
Noxzema woulda had cake.

1548
00:37:03.071 --> 00:37:03.550
And I go,

1549
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.000
Ooh,

1550
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.440
I got to know this kid is,

1551
00:37:05.441 --> 00:37:07.500
and then we became friends instantly there.

1552
00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:08.231
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1553
00:37:08.231 --> 00:37:09.580
Dwayne has been around very,

1554
00:37:09.581 --> 00:37:10.420
very nice guy.

1555
00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.910
And now he's the head trainer at a Alpha male.

1556
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:13.420
Yeah.

1557
00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:13.960
That's great.

1558
00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.681
How cool is that?

1559
00:37:14.681 --> 00:37:15.130
He did.

1560
00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:16.180
Was teaching a seminar there.

1561
00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.410
I love watching guys like you move into a commentating careers too.

1562
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.710
Yup.

1563
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:21.101
You A,

1564
00:37:21.101 --> 00:37:22.450
your host MMA live now,

1565
00:37:22.451 --> 00:37:22.691
right?

1566
00:37:22.691 --> 00:37:23.600
What is it inside of them?

1567
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:24.913
Inside of my main,

1568
00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:25.341
what does that,

1569
00:37:25.341 --> 00:37:26.770
my main lives that even exist in anymore?

1570
00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.960
I don't know all these different fucking names.

1571
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:29.861
The porn thing is,

1572
00:37:29.861 --> 00:37:30.970
it's on access TV.

1573
00:37:30.971 --> 00:37:33.940
It's you and Kenny rice and guests always.

1574
00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:34.630
And uh,

1575
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:35.680
he'd been doing it a long time now.

1576
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.570
<v 5>Shake.</v>

1577
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:37.080
She has man.

1578
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.630
It's a crazy,

1579
00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:39.120
yeah.

1580
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.000
Every wig gets a great gig.

1581
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:41.481
It is.

1582
00:37:41.481 --> 00:37:43.950
This is the Gig that salt,

1583
00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:44.870
uh,

1584
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:47.030
pulled me out of all the stress,

1585
00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:47.511
you know,

1586
00:37:47.511 --> 00:37:48.360
I was people,

1587
00:37:48.361 --> 00:37:51.410
I have no clue what I had to do to stay here,

1588
00:37:51.411 --> 00:37:52.310
to survive with,

1589
00:37:52.311 --> 00:37:53.180
for my family.

1590
00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:53.721
You know,

1591
00:37:53.721 --> 00:37:56.630
the first nine years I missed every Christmas,

1592
00:37:56.631 --> 00:37:59.510
every new year because I was in Japan doing those big shows.

1593
00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:00.291
You know,

1594
00:38:00.291 --> 00:38:01.550
I missed the holidays,

1595
00:38:01.551 --> 00:38:02.361
birthdays,

1596
00:38:02.361 --> 00:38:05.060
I missed the birth of my youngest daughter.

1597
00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.120
I mean a whole because I had to go otherwise there was no more money.

1598
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.680
We give people think when you're on TV,

1599
00:38:09.681 --> 00:38:10.850
but the paper view Uri,

1600
00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:11.840
he's rich.

1601
00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.770
It doesn't work like that,

1602
00:38:12.771 --> 00:38:13.041
you know?

1603
00:38:13.041 --> 00:38:13.261
And,

1604
00:38:13.261 --> 00:38:16.220
and I had to come back and right away I had to do a seminar here and the seminar

1605
00:38:16.221 --> 00:38:16.521
there,

1606
00:38:16.521 --> 00:38:18.830
and constant traveling constantly.

1607
00:38:18.831 --> 00:38:20.480
And then when inside of a May came along,

1608
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:21.171
you know,

1609
00:38:21.171 --> 00:38:24.380
they gave me the basic income and that was the first time in my 11.

1610
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.540
Now I actually have the power to say no,

1611
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:27.231
you know,

1612
00:38:27.231 --> 00:38:28.700
and now it's an actually,

1613
00:38:28.701 --> 00:38:31.550
financially he's also much better because now they're going to,

1614
00:38:31.551 --> 00:38:32.221
if you say no,

1615
00:38:32.221 --> 00:38:32.600
this hell,

1616
00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.433
I'll double it.

1617
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:33.710
No,

1618
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.870
no,

1619
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:34.571
I really know it.

1620
00:38:34.571 --> 00:38:34.701
Oh,

1621
00:38:34.701 --> 00:38:35.800
what about we triple it?

1622
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:36.280
You see

1623
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:36.850
<v 4>it's,</v>

1624
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:39.940
but I didn't have that power all the way back and now for me,

1625
00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:41.200
if it really doesn't interest me,

1626
00:38:41.201 --> 00:38:42.250
I'd rather stay with the family.

1627
00:38:42.251 --> 00:38:42.521
You know what?

1628
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:43.061
I missed enough.

1629
00:38:43.061 --> 00:38:45.910
I'm trying to catch up now and see if I can do that.

1630
00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:46.541
Yeah,

1631
00:38:46.541 --> 00:38:48.070
that's a tough thing.

1632
00:38:48.071 --> 00:38:49.150
You are the commentator,

1633
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:52.990
the head commentary and pride and you were constantly going back and forth for

1634
00:38:52.991 --> 00:38:53.081
that.

1635
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:54.550
How many fights did you go over there to cover?

1636
00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.490
12 year because you have Bushido at her one time.

1637
00:38:57.491 --> 00:39:00.070
Also I 12 a year when I became citizen here,

1638
00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:00.281
right.

1639
00:39:00.281 --> 00:39:04.960
I had to count how many times I left the country and I had a passport and I go,

1640
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:05.651
my God,

1641
00:39:05.651 --> 00:39:06.700
this is an insane number.

1642
00:39:06.701 --> 00:39:11.701
So I went to my old passport and I started counting 152 times I've been to

1643
00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:13.540
Japan,

1644
00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.850
but that's Holland and an America.

1645
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.171
Is that crazy?

1646
00:39:17.171 --> 00:39:18.220
I mean we're talking about that.

1647
00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:22.000
That's a three year solid straight because every time it was at least average a

1648
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.600
week because sometimes it was four days but many times a week or or or I say

1649
00:39:25.601 --> 00:39:28.570
sometimes even for three weeks to train there because I had no training partners

1650
00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:29.404
in the holidays.

1651
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.680
You are still thinking about finding back then to whatever kept you from

1652
00:39:32.681 --> 00:39:37.180
fighting in pride because I was Ruben Warpath I was going to come back.

1653
00:39:37.181 --> 00:39:39.000
I was going to come back when uh,

1654
00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.150
you know I had many injuries.

1655
00:39:40.151 --> 00:39:43.030
I started really because all the injuries tend to night is I had,

1656
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:47.890
I think it comes from all the cortisone I took when I was a kid and that started

1657
00:39:47.891 --> 00:39:50.140
really to flaring up and once that starts,

1658
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:50.470
man,

1659
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.500
it's training till the fight is going to be nightmare.

1660
00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:57.150
You have about 45 minutes to train without it and then it will hit you,

1661
00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:57.910
you,

1662
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:58.540
you,

1663
00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:01.480
you know as much about stop training because everything will go downhill from

1664
00:40:01.481 --> 00:40:04.510
there and then you're in pain for an hour and a half intense.

1665
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.210
It's like really intense pain and you know,

1666
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:08.530
it sucks the life out of me.

1667
00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:09.820
And not happy anymore.

1668
00:40:09.821 --> 00:40:12.910
And I didn't want to train and I couldn't eat because of the pain.

1669
00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:13.481
Wow.

1670
00:40:13.481 --> 00:40:14.410
This tendonitis is,

1671
00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:15.880
you believe it's from cortisone shots.

1672
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.720
I took way too many conditions when I was a kid because I was so sick,

1673
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.650
you know,

1674
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:21.280
at a,

1675
00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:21.821
but anyway,

1676
00:40:21.821 --> 00:40:25.690
then when I started recently training a little bit and just striking,

1677
00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:25.901
you know,

1678
00:40:25.901 --> 00:40:29.530
I tried to stay away from grappling because if I have to power out or something

1679
00:40:29.531 --> 00:40:30.370
then it would hit again.

1680
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:31.421
And then,

1681
00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:32.020
um,

1682
00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:32.531
when,

1683
00:40:32.531 --> 00:40:33.280
um,

1684
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.330
Ken shamrock came,

1685
00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:34.931
I said,

1686
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:35.764
listen,

1687
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.120
I want to be first fight.

1688
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:37.601
You know,

1689
00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:38.740
I come out of retirement for him.

1690
00:40:38.741 --> 00:40:39.101
I want to,

1691
00:40:39.101 --> 00:40:39.731
I'm going to find him.

1692
00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:40.590
But he declined.

1693
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:40.841
He said,

1694
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:40.931
no,

1695
00:40:40.931 --> 00:40:41.770
we already did it.

1696
00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.540
We don't need to do it again.

1697
00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:44.050
So,

1698
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:44.980
but that was the,

1699
00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.740
I was going to fight for the fight.

1700
00:40:47.741 --> 00:40:51.670
And then it was almost happened with Vandelay at the dynamite show because there

1701
00:40:51.671 --> 00:40:55.390
was a mix between k one and an h and m and mixed martial arts,

1702
00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:56.224
a pride.

1703
00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.453
And um,

1704
00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.880
I said they looking for an opponent for ventilator.

1705
00:40:59.881 --> 00:41:00.210
I said,

1706
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:00.400
oh,

1707
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.180
I'll fire him.

1708
00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:01.760
I said,

1709
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.090
what,

1710
00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.110
what are we doing on a rule on this?

1711
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.260
And I haven't been ground fighting for three years.

1712
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.251
What about this?

1713
00:41:06.251 --> 00:41:06.940
People want to see this.

1714
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:07.330
Anyway,

1715
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:10.270
we'll put on the PRI gloves and we do k one rules.

1716
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.841
You know,

1717
00:41:10.841 --> 00:41:12.460
I think that's what people would love to see.

1718
00:41:12.461 --> 00:41:13.294
Right.

1719
00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:14.290
And then also,

1720
00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:18.250
I didn't happen at last segment and it was not because of that would have been

1721
00:41:18.251 --> 00:41:18.521
great,

1722
00:41:18.521 --> 00:41:18.791
I think,

1723
00:41:18.791 --> 00:41:19.900
because at that time almost,

1724
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.760
I pretty a shake a shape.

1725
00:41:21.761 --> 00:41:25.690
I started kicking a Amir's type ads and he,

1726
00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.810
his whole arms were bruised up the next day he goes,

1727
00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:30.230
I think you already said.

1728
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:30.591
So,

1729
00:41:30.591 --> 00:41:31.000
uh,

1730
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:31.660
I felt good.

1731
00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:32.111
Ah,

1732
00:41:32.111 --> 00:41:34.010
that would have been an amazing to say,

1733
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.030
<v 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1734
00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:35.601
I still,

1735
00:41:35.601 --> 00:41:36.740
till this day I always say,

1736
00:41:36.741 --> 00:41:40.790
why isn't there a company that comes out with that idea that I just said they

1737
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:41.960
did cage combat.

1738
00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:42.440
It's gone,

1739
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:42.830
but yeah.

1740
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:43.111
Yeah.

1741
00:41:43.111 --> 00:41:43.890
And uh,

1742
00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:44.723
what is his name?

1743
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.020
John Wayne Parks Australia.

1744
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:49.243
Do you know who he is?

1745
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.760
I heard about a bad ass.

1746
00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:51.860
Kickbox are very,

1747
00:41:51.861 --> 00:41:52.311
very good.

1748
00:41:52.311 --> 00:41:53.870
Kickboxer that's fun.

1749
00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:54.411
Yeah.

1750
00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:55.130
And he's uh,

1751
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:55.963
he's calling it,

1752
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:58.700
I think it's called caged Moyie Thai or something like that.

1753
00:41:58.701 --> 00:41:58.910
Let me,

1754
00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:01.330
let me find out how many minutes.

1755
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:02.830
Like 500 bucks as well.

1756
00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:04.460
They do it like for three minute rounds.

1757
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:05.201
Sandwich,

1758
00:42:05.201 --> 00:42:05.960
cable and done.

1759
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:06.111
Yeah.

1760
00:42:06.111 --> 00:42:07.790
I think that's how they're doing it.

1761
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.980
Um,

1762
00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.960
let me find this,

1763
00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:14.060
cause I know there were,

1764
00:42:14.061 --> 00:42:14.894
uh,

1765
00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:15.680
he's a,

1766
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.880
he's a good dude too.

1767
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.720
I want to get PC though.

1768
00:42:18.721 --> 00:42:19.554
That's exciting.

1769
00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:20.621
Yeah,

1770
00:42:20.621 --> 00:42:20.931
yeah,

1771
00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:21.430
yeah.

1772
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:22.263
Watch out.

1773
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:23.560
Yeah,

1774
00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:23.870
it's,

1775
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:24.710
it is interesting,

1776
00:42:24.711 --> 00:42:25.131
isn't it?

1777
00:42:25.131 --> 00:42:25.964
That uh,

1778
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:29.710
they other strikers striking sports never switched it.

1779
00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.441
A little gloves.

1780
00:42:30.441 --> 00:42:31.700
I never tried the little gloves.

1781
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:32.803
It's amazing.

1782
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:36.170
It's amazing because now we realize that it doesn't really,

1783
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:37.503
you know,

1784
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.950
it's not really any difference I guess.

1785
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:40.820
But the impact,

1786
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:44.240
I think only body shots maybe because it's a smaller surface,

1787
00:42:44.241 --> 00:42:45.860
it penetrates to easier I think,

1788
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:47.980
but I don't think that the had,

1789
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.171
you know,

1790
00:42:48.171 --> 00:42:51.420
even with a bare knuckle hitting your head or with the glove.

1791
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.700
But if I have to say,

1792
00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:54.860
I do think that with the glove has more impact.

1793
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.260
People don't understand that bare knuckle,

1794
00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:57.801
bare knuckle,

1795
00:42:57.801 --> 00:42:58.730
you could really hurt yourself.

1796
00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.730
Also punching some hardheaded dude in the forehead.

1797
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.061
Oh,

1798
00:43:02.061 --> 00:43:03.570
that's what I used to do when it was a bounce.

1799
00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:04.040
Also,

1800
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:04.630
I was at,

1801
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:05.030
look at it,

1802
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.641
my fellow bonuses,

1803
00:43:05.641 --> 00:43:05.961
I say,

1804
00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:06.461
check this out.

1805
00:43:06.461 --> 00:43:07.370
There's somebody who was angry.

1806
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:12.170
I let her throw a punch and I just leaned forward to hit the top of my head,

1807
00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:13.131
you know,

1808
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:13.964
and uh,

1809
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.730
it's a fun way to pull a trick on somebody because they,

1810
00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:17.840
they hit you once.

1811
00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:19.010
Yeah.

1812
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.843
Once.

1813
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:25.190
So John Wayne Pars Company's called Caged Moy Tai and uh,

1814
00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:25.791
it is,

1815
00:43:25.791 --> 00:43:26.180
uh,

1816
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.930
it is essentially that it's a movie tie in a cage.

1817
00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.190
Ever make left a,

1818
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.971
I'm going to make gloves.

1819
00:43:31.971 --> 00:43:33.950
I believe at something like gloves 11.

1820
00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.150
It looks like him on my gloves.

1821
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:35.870
Yeah.

1822
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:36.540
Um,

1823
00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:36.850
the,

1824
00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:39.740
there's a difference in the way you can defend yourself too with those boxing

1825
00:43:39.741 --> 00:43:40.574
gloves.

1826
00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.570
A big difference.

1827
00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:41.840
You know,

1828
00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.190
it used to cover yourself up,

1829
00:43:43.191 --> 00:43:47.120
you cover so much more area and then they glove goes right behind it right

1830
00:43:47.121 --> 00:43:47.820
through the middle.

1831
00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:48.430
Yeah.

1832
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:49.263
Interesting.

1833
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:49.710
Yeah.

1834
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:51.080
Especially buddy shots also.

1835
00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:52.190
Yeah.

1836
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.461
Right.

1837
00:43:52.461 --> 00:43:53.800
You really can dig in with,

1838
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:54.010
Oh,

1839
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:54.561
I shot.

1840
00:43:54.561 --> 00:43:56.000
It's not a blunt object,

1841
00:43:56.001 --> 00:43:56.740
it's sharp.

1842
00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.360
That's why finally we see guys,

1843
00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.201
you know,

1844
00:44:00.201 --> 00:44:00.800
doing it.

1845
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.870
I always talk about the,

1846
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:02.900
I never get it.

1847
00:44:02.901 --> 00:44:04.010
I always tell my students,

1848
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:05.150
I say fighting is really easy,

1849
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:05.680
right?

1850
00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.100
You hit somebody really hunting ahead.

1851
00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.490
Defense will go up and there's the buddy for you or you do it the other way

1852
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:10.790
around.

1853
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:11.590
Like forming that.

1854
00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:14.990
If the body real hot until they have to defend it and then you go on top.

1855
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:16.940
Now when you rock somebody,

1856
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:18.051
step back,

1857
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:21.170
what is he going to defend when you hit somebody at the under chin?

1858
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.520
Well he's going to defend his hat.

1859
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:27.290
Why on earth would you start hitting the hat now this is your mom to go to the

1860
00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:28.850
body but hit it hard.

1861
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.320
Cross who cross to the body.

1862
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:31.363
You know,

1863
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.620
combinations like that hit as hard as she can.

1864
00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:38.510
That defense has to come down and then you go back to the head and they planted

1865
00:44:38.511 --> 00:44:39.100
themselves,

1866
00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.410
need attack the legs.

1867
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:41.870
But I mean there's only,

1868
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.590
there's a few fighters out there.

1869
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:48.300
The last one I saw using it was Rory macdonald against Bj Penn who dropped him

1870
00:44:48.301 --> 00:44:50.280
with a body shot or your window not dropping,

1871
00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:52.890
but he was hurt and right away he went back to the head,

1872
00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:53.731
you know,

1873
00:44:53.731 --> 00:44:54.270
and that's,

1874
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:54.541
you know,

1875
00:44:54.541 --> 00:44:57.360
get them into comfort zone again to bring the hands up and then go for the buddy

1876
00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:57.630
again.

1877
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:59.250
You see in that kit that I say,

1878
00:44:59.251 --> 00:45:01.140
oh is she now he's thinking,

1879
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:01.381
well,

1880
00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:03.560
he's one of those new Rory Macdonald's,

1881
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:06.390
one of those new breed of guys that is getting great at everything.

1882
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.630
He doesn't just have one specialty like a wrestler who learned some ground and

1883
00:45:09.631 --> 00:45:10.200
pound.

1884
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:10.690
Now he's a,

1885
00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:14.400
he's essentially mixed martial artists from the jump and so it was very

1886
00:45:14.401 --> 00:45:17.430
technical and in all aspects of his attack.

1887
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.410
But you're right in the striking,

1888
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:24.590
we're just sort of starting to see people who have a more nuanced understanding

1889
00:45:25.321 --> 00:45:26.550
of different kicks.

1890
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:26.971
You know,

1891
00:45:26.971 --> 00:45:28.290
like how about front kicks?

1892
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:30.780
All of a sudden people land in front kicks to the face.

1893
00:45:30.781 --> 00:45:31.380
Yep.

1894
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:31.621
Yeah.

1895
00:45:31.621 --> 00:45:32.550
Never happened.

1896
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.151
That did not.

1897
00:45:33.151 --> 00:45:36.430
All the fights we've seen and how you guys got knocked out with a front kick to

1898
00:45:36.431 --> 00:45:36.910
the face.

1899
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:38.410
I did not give up but I,

1900
00:45:38.411 --> 00:45:40.380
I kicked him under his nose and a frank shamrock.

1901
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:41.520
It's a front kick to know,

1902
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:43.110
say you had a shoe on too.

1903
00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:45.570
He smelled that

1904
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.470
pancreas was a weird thing.

1905
00:45:49.471 --> 00:45:51.030
If anybody who has never seen it before,

1906
00:45:51.031 --> 00:45:55.920
they wore shoes and then shin guards over the shoes and you couldn't punch to

1907
00:45:55.921 --> 00:45:56.431
the face.

1908
00:45:56.431 --> 00:45:58.560
He had a slap open hand.

1909
00:45:58.590 --> 00:45:58.980
Yup.

1910
00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:02.010
But boss was the only one to figure out that instead of slapping,

1911
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:03.750
use punch combinations.

1912
00:46:03.751 --> 00:46:06.270
But just pull the hand way back and,

1913
00:46:06.271 --> 00:46:06.781
and you know,

1914
00:46:06.781 --> 00:46:08.790
you're essentially blast them with the palm.

1915
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.700
And in a way it's even better because you can't break your hand.

1916
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.713
You know,

1917
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:13.051
I,

1918
00:46:13.051 --> 00:46:17.940
until this day I still don't get it that people don't use it because I always

1919
00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:18.721
say it's very simple.

1920
00:46:18.721 --> 00:46:19.560
If I'm standing here,

1921
00:46:19.561 --> 00:46:21.150
this is the target,

1922
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:22.350
a left hook right straight.

1923
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:25.740
If I conduct with the connect with the left took up to close from my ride

1924
00:46:25.741 --> 00:46:26.250
straight,

1925
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.150
it doesn't have power.

1926
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.600
It needs,

1927
00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.900
it needs space to do get power to,

1928
00:46:29.901 --> 00:46:30.081
to,

1929
00:46:30.081 --> 00:46:30.371
to,

1930
00:46:30.371 --> 00:46:30.870
to get,

1931
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:31.920
pick up speed so to say.

1932
00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:32.773
Right.

1933
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.350
But if I do a palm strike and I,

1934
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:36.001
but I do it.

1935
00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:38.040
Yeah you see it already but I pull all the way back.

1936
00:46:38.041 --> 00:46:43.020
I hit with this bony part here and I hit under air just here underneath the air,

1937
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.500
but now the straight punch is way better lined up.

1938
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.460
Then they'll have to have bright,

1939
00:46:47.461 --> 00:46:48.211
strange combination.

1940
00:46:48.211 --> 00:46:48.900
I don't get it.

1941
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:52.380
I get it across Hook because with the cross you bring the head backwards and the

1942
00:46:52.381 --> 00:46:52.541
hook,

1943
00:46:52.541 --> 00:46:53.374
we'll catch it,

1944
00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:54.750
but it have to look right straight.

1945
00:46:54.751 --> 00:46:58.560
I say use a palm strike and it says still till this day they don't do it.

1946
00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:01.110
It's essentially a bitch slap right hand combination.

1947
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:01.711
That's it.

1948
00:47:01.711 --> 00:47:02.490
That's what it is.

1949
00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:03.960
Maybe they don't do it because of that.

1950
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:04.470
They think,

1951
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.830
you know,

1952
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:05.431
but how cool is,

1953
00:47:05.431 --> 00:47:09.790
I believe slept on the couch and today you have to keep your hands close to you.

1954
00:47:09.791 --> 00:47:10.320
You can't,

1955
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.180
you're not supposed to strike with your hands open.

1956
00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:12.900
I mean,

1957
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.660
I guess you could probably get away with a karate chop or something like that,

1958
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:18.150
but the issue is going forward and poking eyes.

1959
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.600
We have a real problem with a I Pogues.

1960
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:21.090
Wow.

1961
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:24.180
You're a guy had been around a long time and you fought,

1962
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:24.660
you know,

1963
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.160
the bare knuckle days did,

1964
00:47:26.161 --> 00:47:26.451
did,

1965
00:47:26.451 --> 00:47:28.800
was there as many I pokes back then as there are now.

1966
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:30.003
You don't know

1967
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.910
<v 4>what really messed me up as the pro wrestling I started doing after,</v>

1968
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:36.910
after my chemo was over and I started,

1969
00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:37.650
you know,

1970
00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:39.820
I felt that I could do something again and uh,

1971
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:40.260
you know,

1972
00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.710
he asked me to do pro wrestling.

1973
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.080
My first fight,

1974
00:47:44.081 --> 00:47:48.340
I break a disc in my back and then the second one I rupture my eyeball with a

1975
00:47:48.341 --> 00:47:50.320
finger in my eye because she don't block the punch.

1976
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:51.310
She let him hit you.

1977
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.020
And a third almost.

1978
00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:53.300
Oh yeah.

1979
00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:56.740
An eardrum that's been broke for six years straight because I,

1980
00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:57.521
because you fly,

1981
00:47:57.521 --> 00:47:58.770
you can't fix it because you,

1982
00:47:58.771 --> 00:48:01.240
you cannot fly for six weeks when to do it.

1983
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.961
Actually,

1984
00:48:01.961 --> 00:48:03.070
it is a funny story.

1985
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:06.790
My first pro wrestling match was with Don Frye was in my corner.

1986
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:10.990
I was fighting this guy and he knew she my or something and was at the Tokyo

1987
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.020
Dome,

1988
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.790
right to so 60,000 people.

1989
00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:13.691
And uh,

1990
00:48:13.691 --> 00:48:13.941
you,

1991
00:48:13.941 --> 00:48:14.860
you go through a,

1992
00:48:14.861 --> 00:48:15.251
you know,

1993
00:48:15.251 --> 00:48:16.060
and uh,

1994
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.350
this is what you do in the beginning.

1995
00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:20.510
Then you ad Lib a little bit and then in the middle of you do this and they ad

1996
00:48:20.511 --> 00:48:21.490
lib some morning and the edge,

1997
00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:21.761
you know,

1998
00:48:21.761 --> 00:48:22.150
you got the,

1999
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:23.630
of the orchestrated progresses.

2000
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.020
Yeah.

2001
00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:24.270
Pro.

2002
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:24.520
Yeah,

2003
00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.353
real promising.

2004
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.640
And um,

2005
00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:26.890
it,

2006
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:28.900
it was gonna he was gonna at the start,

2007
00:48:28.901 --> 00:48:29.980
he was going to pick me up,

2008
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:34.030
throw me in the corner and gave me like three elbows in the face and then he

2009
00:48:34.031 --> 00:48:34.841
would go to the,

2010
00:48:34.841 --> 00:48:36.610
to the audience like woo.

2011
00:48:36.611 --> 00:48:37.910
And he would drop me with an elbow.

2012
00:48:37.911 --> 00:48:39.130
I will take an eight count,

2013
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:39.371
you know,

2014
00:48:39.371 --> 00:48:41.050
and then I would start,

2015
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.110
but I'd never progressed in my life before.

2016
00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:48.270
So he attacks me and the first Albo he gives and he's perfectly timed.

2017
00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:52.060
But the second one is a little harder and the third one hits me full.

2018
00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.570
And my automatic reflex kicks in and I go boom.

2019
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.920
And I hit him in the face and he goes,

2020
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.850
Ooh.

2021
00:48:57.850 --> 00:48:58.683
And he's out.

2022
00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.690
So I look at Don and he goes,

2023
00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:03.563
and I go,

2024
00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:03.881
no.

2025
00:49:03.881 --> 00:49:04.381
And the referee,

2026
00:49:04.381 --> 00:49:06.470
he's walking around with a guy and he goes,

2027
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:07.343
Juan.

2028
00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:12.340
And he walks around too and just start dragging the time,

2029
00:49:12.341 --> 00:49:13.174
you know?

2030
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:14.130
Hey,

2031
00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:14.800
yeah.

2032
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.840
He started twitching and he started waking up,

2033
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:18.550
you know the dog for a moment.

2034
00:49:18.551 --> 00:49:19.090
He goes like,

2035
00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:19.600
dude,

2036
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.141
that was crazy.

2037
00:49:20.141 --> 00:49:20.974
I say he hit me hard.

2038
00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:22.180
So then the next time,

2039
00:49:22.181 --> 00:49:22.750
so did you,

2040
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:25.900
did the guy get up and finish the and he finished the match so it almost

2041
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.580
unconscious gushers oh,

2042
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:28.590
he was with his eyes open.

2043
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.460
It was when you wake him up,

2044
00:49:30.461 --> 00:49:31.294
what do you tell him?

2045
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:31.571
No,

2046
00:49:31.571 --> 00:49:31.901
nothing.

2047
00:49:31.901 --> 00:49:32.560
Afterwards.

2048
00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.700
Everybody got scared.

2049
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:34.691
So they came to me.

2050
00:49:34.691 --> 00:49:35.141
The second one,

2051
00:49:35.141 --> 00:49:35.800
he goes,

2052
00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.180
please put down no real fight.

2053
00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:37.570
I said,

2054
00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:38.500
you don't hit me.

2055
00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:39.670
I know have to hit you.

2056
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:40.520
It's very simple.

2057
00:49:40.521 --> 00:49:41.080
You know,

2058
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:41.913
he hit me hard,

2059
00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:42.160
you know?

2060
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.450
That's why right.

2061
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:44.590
He took advantage of you,

2062
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:45.251
I guess.

2063
00:49:45.251 --> 00:49:45.700
I don't know.

2064
00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:46.780
Maybe it was on purpose.

2065
00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:47.231
Maybe not,

2066
00:49:47.231 --> 00:49:48.064
but uh,

2067
00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.360
but there wasn't as many.

2068
00:49:49.361 --> 00:49:50.510
I pokes back there and then them,

2069
00:49:50.511 --> 00:49:50.950
no,

2070
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:51.720
none of them are mine.

2071
00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.210
Is that,

2072
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:53.730
why do you think that's happening so much?

2073
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:55.660
I never hit like this,

2074
00:49:55.661 --> 00:49:57.700
but I'm going to hands and I would all the way pulled back.

2075
00:49:57.701 --> 00:49:58.534
I never touched.

2076
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:59.141
You know,

2077
00:49:59.141 --> 00:50:03.160
I think it's also a lot of guys who have no a good control and you know,

2078
00:50:03.161 --> 00:50:03.551
if they,

2079
00:50:03.551 --> 00:50:04.271
I mean to,

2080
00:50:04.271 --> 00:50:05.140
I poke somebody,

2081
00:50:05.141 --> 00:50:05.620
I'm,

2082
00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:08.200
I cannot even imagine that I would never happen with me.

2083
00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:09.820
Well there'll be polishing off.

2084
00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:10.780
That's what everyone is doing.

2085
00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:13.540
Well they got that because you know,

2086
00:50:13.541 --> 00:50:14.374
you had,

2087
00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:14.981
you know,

2088
00:50:14.981 --> 00:50:18.790
you were fighting over the hands open and you weren't poking guy's eyes.

2089
00:50:18.791 --> 00:50:19.451
That's what I mean.

2090
00:50:19.451 --> 00:50:19.751
You know,

2091
00:50:19.751 --> 00:50:21.340
and I never impact course.

2092
00:50:21.341 --> 00:50:22.600
I never took a big,

2093
00:50:22.601 --> 00:50:23.111
big issue.

2094
00:50:23.111 --> 00:50:25.210
Now to the point where it's almost,

2095
00:50:25.211 --> 00:50:26.200
it looks like it's on purpose.

2096
00:50:26.201 --> 00:50:26.831
Sometimes you know,

2097
00:50:26.831 --> 00:50:27.664
you're going to really do it.

2098
00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:29.320
<v 0>I would hate to speculate,</v>

2099
00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.940
but it's a very unfortunate aspect of having the ability to have open fingers.

2100
00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:38.710
And I was wondering if you think there would could be a way we could cover over

2101
00:50:38.711 --> 00:50:41.500
the tips with like maybe a soft leather.

2102
00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:45.130
So it was all like one smooth piece over the top,

2103
00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:48.880
but it was soft enough so that he could still grapple because most people don't

2104
00:50:48.881 --> 00:50:49.361
understand.

2105
00:50:49.361 --> 00:50:51.280
You don't really grapple like that anyway.

2106
00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:51.550
No,

2107
00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:55.290
you use your whole hand and the only time you eat the thumb even is involved is

2108
00:50:55.291 --> 00:50:56.230
with the risk control.

2109
00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:58.690
I mean most of the time when I'm grabbing things,

2110
00:50:58.691 --> 00:51:00.640
I'm grabbing things like this cause I,

2111
00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.770
I'm pulling with my thumb.

2112
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:06.160
I give myself the added muscle down with my thumb.

2113
00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.470
Whereas you don't have that if you do.

2114
00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.440
<v 5>Not only that,</v>

2115
00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:09.480
this situation,

2116
00:51:09.481 --> 00:51:10.081
for instance,

2117
00:51:10.081 --> 00:51:11.170
when somebody has a mountain,

2118
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.350
me and a and then never get this anyway,

2119
00:51:13.351 --> 00:51:13.680
uh,

2120
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:14.530
people that amount,

2121
00:51:14.531 --> 00:51:15.780
they let themselves just buck up.

2122
00:51:15.781 --> 00:51:17.130
I always say it's so simple.

2123
00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.630
I mean just fricking buck up.

2124
00:51:18.631 --> 00:51:20.190
You don't bring your feet close to your bus.

2125
00:51:20.191 --> 00:51:20.791
Stop bucking up.

2126
00:51:20.791 --> 00:51:21.870
He needs to look for balance.

2127
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.211
Right.

2128
00:51:22.211 --> 00:51:25.350
I guess keep hitting you now at the moment he looks for Bella should catch one

2129
00:51:25.351 --> 00:51:27.630
hand and then it's what I always say to my students,

2130
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:29.460
these two fingers had a strongest.

2131
00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:30.181
So what I do,

2132
00:51:30.181 --> 00:51:34.110
I grab two and two because that's a stronger grip around the wrist.

2133
00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:35.010
Then when I do this,

2134
00:51:35.011 --> 00:51:35.730
see she might,

2135
00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.880
and she does the carpal tunnel as sometimes I could.

2136
00:51:37.881 --> 00:51:38.090
Uh,

2137
00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.200
I that comes with the neck is the worst.

2138
00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:40.910
<v 0>Say this,</v>

2139
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:41.930
these three,

2140
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.540
three fingers on each hand.

2141
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.850
<v 5>On,</v>

2142
00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:45.780
on one wrist.

2143
00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:46.350
Yeah,

2144
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:49.470
a goal route on the wrist and a and a bullet to one side.

2145
00:51:49.471 --> 00:51:51.720
I look up the foot and I throw him to the other side.

2146
00:51:51.721 --> 00:51:52.500
It's sort of easy,

2147
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.333
simple reversal.

2148
00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:54.520
<v 0>This,</v>

2149
00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.280
the grabbing like this is stronger than grabbing them.

2150
00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:57.711
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

2151
00:51:57.711 --> 00:51:58.481
because she looked,

2152
00:51:58.481 --> 00:52:00.390
this hand is here and the other end the had,

2153
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.800
look how open your grip becomes because of the forearm.

2154
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.700
But if you have around two fingers here and the attitude fingers there,

2155
00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:10.100
you got a really strong grip on one hand,

2156
00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:13.260
even when you're on the bottom and he hits you with the other head.

2157
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:15.261
<v 0>I see what you're saying.</v>

2158
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:17.510
For folks that don't know what the fuck you're talking about,

2159
00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:20.350
but what he's saying is that w at the,

2160
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.650
the base of the wrist,

2161
00:52:21.651 --> 00:52:22.700
it's the thinnest.

2162
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.010
So the more strength you have,

2163
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:28.520
more strength in your hands when your fingers are completely wrapped around

2164
00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:31.550
something and the finger and the index finger and the thumb are touching

2165
00:52:31.551 --> 00:52:34.700
together and the more your fingers are spread out,

2166
00:52:34.701 --> 00:52:36.830
the less power you have to grab ahold of something.

2167
00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.240
So in that,

2168
00:52:38.241 --> 00:52:39.830
in the case of the human body,

2169
00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:42.860
you're better off grabbing the wrist with three fingers and three fingers.

2170
00:52:42.861 --> 00:52:43.790
That was a very wise,

2171
00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:44.420
yeah,

2172
00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:44.631
yeah,

2173
00:52:44.631 --> 00:52:44.840
that's,

2174
00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:45.470
that's very,

2175
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:46.101
very smart.

2176
00:52:46.101 --> 00:52:49.460
And so that's what you would do and then fight for a to try to get out of the

2177
00:52:49.461 --> 00:52:50.070
mouth,

2178
00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:50.490
<v 5>you know?</v>

2179
00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:50.780
Yeah,

2180
00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:51.350
because it's,

2181
00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:53.660
it's pretty easy once first of all,

2182
00:52:53.661 --> 00:52:55.640
mount never allowed him to sit on your chest.

2183
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:57.980
That's a bad mom because then you can buck up whatever you want.

2184
00:52:57.981 --> 00:52:58.761
There is no leverage,

2185
00:52:58.761 --> 00:52:58.971
you know,

2186
00:52:58.971 --> 00:52:59.804
so he doesn't move.

2187
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:00.661
So the first thing,

2188
00:53:00.661 --> 00:53:01.281
but I always say,

2189
00:53:01.281 --> 00:53:02.810
keep your elbows here always.

2190
00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:04.820
Plus if he's already a high chest,

2191
00:53:04.821 --> 00:53:07.400
I pushed my elbow share and our wiggle myself upward.

2192
00:53:07.401 --> 00:53:08.570
She don't have to push him down,

2193
00:53:08.571 --> 00:53:11.920
but you can push yourself up or it's because the end result is the same right

2194
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:12.171
now.

2195
00:53:12.171 --> 00:53:13.310
Once he's on your belly,

2196
00:53:13.311 --> 00:53:16.820
the other great thing that comes with it is that his feet are underneath your

2197
00:53:16.821 --> 00:53:17.131
leg,

2198
00:53:17.131 --> 00:53:21.110
so now with your other foot you can catch one of those feet.

2199
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:23.570
You can go listen to this right now going,

2200
00:53:23.571 --> 00:53:25.890
what the fuck is he talking about?

2201
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:26.100
He

2202
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:26.490
<v 4>can,</v>

2203
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:27.070
you can get,

2204
00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:27.700
yeah,

2205
00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:32.700
so I can catch one of his feet here and then if I grabbed his right arm and I

2206
00:53:33.931 --> 00:53:36.690
pull this to the side and at the moment I have it here,

2207
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:39.720
I look at and I'll pull them to that side.

2208
00:53:39.721 --> 00:53:40.650
I take this base.

2209
00:53:40.651 --> 00:53:42.360
It was really good guys.

2210
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.261
Yeah,

2211
00:53:43.261 --> 00:53:43.690
it works.

2212
00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:44.460
Really good guy.

2213
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:48.240
Who's the best guy you ever pull that off on in training?

2214
00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:49.351
That's the whole thing.

2215
00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:49.980
I don't know.

2216
00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:52.980
When someone tells me like someone in the budget or a new technique,

2217
00:53:52.981 --> 00:53:53.270
I'm like,

2218
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:54.103
hmm,

2219
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:55.200
revolutionary technique.

2220
00:53:55.201 --> 00:53:56.810
I just take your post and your post away.

2221
00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:57.750
It's a very nice,

2222
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.920
uh,

2223
00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.570
basically think,

2224
00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:03.120
I think I had to maybe college Newton with it.

2225
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:04.530
Get your shit over at the time,

2226
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:05.131
you know,

2227
00:54:05.131 --> 00:54:06.260
because I've been using that a lot.

2228
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:06.871
You know if you,

2229
00:54:06.871 --> 00:54:07.591
if you're mounting,

2230
00:54:07.591 --> 00:54:08.640
you put an arm around my neck,

2231
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:09.360
you're on your back.

2232
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.290
I guarantee you that.

2233
00:54:10.291 --> 00:54:11.160
I'll go real fast.

2234
00:54:11.161 --> 00:54:12.180
I wait for those moments.

2235
00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:13.080
I extended,

2236
00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.020
I go lay like this.

2237
00:54:14.021 --> 00:54:15.330
That means please take my neck.

2238
00:54:15.331 --> 00:54:15.690
Man.

2239
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:16.770
When you first started,

2240
00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:18.210
you weren't a submission guy at all.

2241
00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:19.650
You were mostly just a standup guy,

2242
00:54:19.651 --> 00:54:19.861
right?

2243
00:54:19.861 --> 00:54:23.370
When you first started competing in pancreas and then what was it like?

2244
00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:24.630
Which fight was it?

2245
00:54:24.631 --> 00:54:28.290
The really major realize that they can share shamrock last one put me in a knee

2246
00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:28.561
bar.

2247
00:54:28.561 --> 00:54:31.700
I trained four weeks to not get caught in a knee bar for knock.

2248
00:54:31.701 --> 00:54:33.480
He taught me one way to stop it.

2249
00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:34.160
He said,

2250
00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:35.030
[inaudible] God,

2251
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:39.000
he's going to slip over your hip and you see me in the fight waiting for him to

2252
00:54:39.001 --> 00:54:40.620
slip over my hip to catch the foot.

2253
00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:43.620
And he threw the leg over my head and I go,

2254
00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:44.820
mother,

2255
00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:45.371
you know he,

2256
00:54:45.371 --> 00:54:45.691
he,

2257
00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:46.091
they,

2258
00:54:46.091 --> 00:54:47.790
they sent me up with,

2259
00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:49.410
but that moment on I said,

2260
00:54:49.411 --> 00:54:49.591
okay,

2261
00:54:49.591 --> 00:54:50.880
this won't ever happen again.

2262
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.470
Now I'm going to listen to people,

2263
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:56.340
but I'm also going to find out if it's really that right way.

2264
00:54:56.341 --> 00:54:58.110
And then I started just breaking down everything.

2265
00:54:58.111 --> 00:54:59.180
I found one sparring partner,

2266
00:54:59.181 --> 00:55:01.020
Leo van Dyke and we went nuts.

2267
00:55:01.021 --> 00:55:02.310
We went three times a day.

2268
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.301
We are rolling,

2269
00:55:03.301 --> 00:55:03.571
rolling,

2270
00:55:03.571 --> 00:55:03.811
rolling.

2271
00:55:03.811 --> 00:55:05.520
Watching on the fights.

2272
00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:06.331
See a move.

2273
00:55:06.331 --> 00:55:06.690
Go.

2274
00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:06.991
Okay.

2275
00:55:06.991 --> 00:55:08.670
How do you get out while I can do this?

2276
00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:08.851
Okay.

2277
00:55:08.851 --> 00:55:09.690
How can I stop that?

2278
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:09.851
Oh,

2279
00:55:09.851 --> 00:55:11.100
you do the agile breaking down,

2280
00:55:11.101 --> 00:55:11.461
breaking down,

2281
00:55:11.461 --> 00:55:14.490
breaking essentially taught yourself a little bit of instruction from other

2282
00:55:14.491 --> 00:55:16.740
people and a lot of it from tape and trial and error.

2283
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:17.490
Yeah,

2284
00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:18.360
just like that.

2285
00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:18.840
You know,

2286
00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:20.850
I had my big DVDs of combat,

2287
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.180
right?

2288
00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:24.960
I had a phone call a long time ago this before I knew Bj Penn personally,

2289
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:26.821
and he said,

2290
00:55:26.821 --> 00:55:27.600
um,

2291
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.470
um,

2292
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.190
uh,

2293
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:30.000
hey bosses,

2294
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.710
Bj [inaudible] Japan.

2295
00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:32.050
Yeah.

2296
00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:32.190
Hey,

2297
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.580
how are you doing?

2298
00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:32.791
Yeah,

2299
00:55:32.791 --> 00:55:34.080
I'm getting ready for a runner.

2300
00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:35.490
It was [inaudible] was fighting against him.

2301
00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:36.460
Uh,

2302
00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:36.930
I said,

2303
00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:37.411
why are you calling?

2304
00:55:37.411 --> 00:55:37.681
He says,

2305
00:55:37.681 --> 00:55:38.141
I'm watching you.

2306
00:55:38.141 --> 00:55:39.600
Instructionals and I say,

2307
00:55:39.601 --> 00:55:40.291
so he says,

2308
00:55:40.291 --> 00:55:41.850
the best instructor I've ever seen in my life,

2309
00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:42.481
I go,

2310
00:55:42.481 --> 00:55:43.111
you're kidding me.

2311
00:55:43.111 --> 00:55:43.531
And he says,

2312
00:55:43.531 --> 00:55:43.681
yeah,

2313
00:55:43.681 --> 00:55:44.151
I gotta go.

2314
00:55:44.151 --> 00:55:44.840
We gotta go.

2315
00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:45.300
Hey,

2316
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.230
can I use that quote?

2317
00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:48.480
Because that's a great quote,

2318
00:55:48.481 --> 00:55:49.860
but he was also a mess with,

2319
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.240
I do a lot of hand control.

2320
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.710
My arm bars are different.

2321
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:54.420
My way of breaking your grip.

2322
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:56.070
If I break your grip,

2323
00:55:56.071 --> 00:55:56.970
you'll never escape.

2324
00:55:56.971 --> 00:55:59.610
I guarantee you that if you break my grip,

2325
00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:01.200
I already set myself up.

2326
00:56:01.201 --> 00:56:02.100
If my legs are locked,

2327
00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:05.280
my elbows right away here and at the moment they stop bulling.

2328
00:56:05.281 --> 00:56:09.150
I throw my other legs in the same line as you and I have to make it really tiny

2329
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:09.420
role.

2330
00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.800
The folks listening to this,

2331
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:13.860
this is all very baffling,

2332
00:56:13.861 --> 00:56:18.420
but it's very exciting because there's a bunch of different branches of

2333
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:20.490
grappling in MMA.

2334
00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:20.881
You know,

2335
00:56:20.881 --> 00:56:24.210
there's like the catch wrassling sort branch where

2336
00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:29.210
<v 0>you know a lot of gene labelle taught guys and a lot like Josh Barnett as well,</v>

2337
00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.170
very catch wrestling oriented,

2338
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:34.620
oriented and of course is a Brazilian jujitsu oriented.

2339
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.800
But there's also like the Japanese style,

2340
00:56:37.801 --> 00:56:42.480
which was sort of a combination of the both like Sakuraba who had a lot of Karl

2341
00:56:42.481 --> 00:56:45.030
gotch influence who's like one of the early,

2342
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:45.250
uh,

2343
00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:49.260
catch wrestling guys to go over to Japan and teach these guys all these

2344
00:56:49.261 --> 00:56:49.921
different techniques.

2345
00:56:49.921 --> 00:56:52.860
But he also had the Japanese martial arts and you know,

2346
00:56:52.861 --> 00:56:53.180
and the,

2347
00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:53.470
the,

2348
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.880
the,

2349
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.700
the judo a submissions and everything as well.

2350
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:58.200
Really fascinating.

2351
00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:58.790
Uh,

2352
00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:59.200
when,

2353
00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:02.670
when you stop and think about when you started,

2354
00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:05.190
I mean the first UFC fight was in 93.

2355
00:57:05.191 --> 00:57:06.420
When was your first pancreas fight?

2356
00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.310
93 yeah,

2357
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.630
so two months before,

2358
00:57:09.631 --> 00:57:10.770
a month before September.

2359
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.740
You were there in the beginning of the blossom.

2360
00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:14.640
You know,

2361
00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.760
it must be really interesting to see all these new techniques.

2362
00:57:17.761 --> 00:57:20.310
And all these walls and really a lot of ancient techniques,

2363
00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:22.410
but become mainstream in new,

2364
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:24.510
<v 5>what I love about [inaudible],</v>

2365
00:57:24.511 --> 00:57:27.650
and this is something I figured out all show like in the early days because

2366
00:57:27.651 --> 00:57:28.030
she's like,

2367
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:31.670
I always say an example is the simple figure for everybody knows if they get

2368
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.920
four,

2369
00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:32.680
right.

2370
00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.101
I said,

2371
00:57:33.101 --> 00:57:35.350
but if you can create a way,

2372
00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:37.360
you seem to like an Americana Americana.

2373
00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:39.100
I called her figure for reverse takeover.

2374
00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.140
So if a hammerlock I mean,

2375
00:57:41.141 --> 00:57:41.800
just so many names.

2376
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:42.200
That's why I,

2377
00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.033
yeah.

2378
00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:43.850
Um,

2379
00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:44.020
uh,

2380
00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:46.570
also they always forget to push the arm down now.

2381
00:57:46.571 --> 00:57:46.991
Certainly,

2382
00:57:46.991 --> 00:57:47.441
but I mean,

2383
00:57:47.441 --> 00:57:47.761
you know,

2384
00:57:47.761 --> 00:57:48.581
she'll hear you.

2385
00:57:48.581 --> 00:57:49.181
You can't do it.

2386
00:57:49.181 --> 00:57:49.811
You push it down.

2387
00:57:49.811 --> 00:57:50.321
Come on dude.

2388
00:57:50.321 --> 00:57:51.370
You have to know this is your

2389
00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:53.430
<v 0>folks listening.</v>

2390
00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:54.570
There's a technique.

2391
00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:55.021
It's like,

2392
00:57:55.021 --> 00:57:55.261
you know,

2393
00:57:55.261 --> 00:57:56.880
when a guy's like showing you his muscle,

2394
00:57:56.881 --> 00:57:57.870
like you look at my bicep,

2395
00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:58.500
boom.

2396
00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:03.500
Well that if you take that arm and just drop it down to the ribs and then pull

2397
00:58:05.011 --> 00:58:06.180
the arm backwards,

2398
00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:10.170
this is surprisingly small amount of room that you can move where you're in

2399
00:58:10.171 --> 00:58:11.430
excruciating pain.

2400
00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:15.570
But if you keep it up there where you show like the muscle,

2401
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:16.740
you can move way back.

2402
00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:17.591
<v 5>People roll out.</v>

2403
00:58:17.591 --> 00:58:19.700
Did they ask you to submit shirts?

2404
00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:20.760
But you can get out of it.

2405
00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:21.120
But,

2406
00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.740
but what I always say is everybody knows it's probably the first submission

2407
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:24.583
they'd been taught.

2408
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:29.280
But if you can create different ways to go that submit to set test submission

2409
00:58:29.281 --> 00:58:29.490
show,

2410
00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:30.420
it's undetected,

2411
00:58:30.421 --> 00:58:31.860
it's like the right straight to the face,

2412
00:58:31.861 --> 00:58:32.700
you know it's going to come.

2413
00:58:32.701 --> 00:58:36.840
But if I find a way to bring to deliver it undetected and that's cancer,

2414
00:58:36.841 --> 00:58:38.580
same for a forum submissions.

2415
00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:42.780
And that's why I always found two or three or sometimes four,

2416
00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:44.160
sorry,

2417
00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.860
four different ways to go to one combination.

2418
00:58:46.861 --> 00:58:50.070
And when I start mixing those up also I go from one to four,

2419
00:58:50.071 --> 00:58:51.390
then I go for two to four,

2420
00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:51.930
you know,

2421
00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:52.621
then you know,

2422
00:58:52.621 --> 00:58:53.940
eventually you catch somebody in a,

2423
00:58:53.941 --> 00:58:57.120
a guy was really good with that also is no guarantee in the early days,

2424
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.511
you know,

2425
00:58:57.511 --> 00:59:00.810
he's got triangle armbar old plotter and a constantly pop up,

2426
00:59:00.811 --> 00:59:00.961
up,

2427
00:59:00.961 --> 00:59:01.111
up,

2428
00:59:01.111 --> 00:59:01.290
up,

2429
00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:01.451
up,

2430
00:59:01.451 --> 00:59:01.791
up cost.

2431
00:59:01.791 --> 00:59:02.280
You aren't,

2432
00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:02.611
you know,

2433
00:59:02.611 --> 00:59:02.851
and,

2434
00:59:02.851 --> 00:59:04.050
and that's what I like,

2435
00:59:04.051 --> 00:59:04.884
you know,

2436
00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:05.790
find different ways.

2437
00:59:05.791 --> 00:59:06.690
And that's the coolest one.

2438
00:59:06.691 --> 00:59:07.524
I see nowadays.

2439
00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:09.960
You see guys get so creative,

2440
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:12.210
suddenly there's a submission and I go walk by,

2441
00:59:12.211 --> 00:59:12.631
rewind,

2442
00:59:12.631 --> 00:59:12.961
they go,

2443
00:59:12.961 --> 00:59:14.220
how the hell did he said that?

2444
00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:15.061
And then you know,

2445
00:59:15.061 --> 00:59:18.180
and that's something I really enjoy watching,

2446
00:59:18.181 --> 00:59:18.451
you know,

2447
00:59:18.451 --> 00:59:20.040
when I can't see it coming.

2448
00:59:20.041 --> 00:59:21.650
Then I got like okay is,

2449
00:59:21.651 --> 00:59:22.190
that's really

2450
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.730
<v 0>cool.</v>

2451
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:23.180
Now when,

2452
00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:24.620
what do you miss about pride?

2453
00:59:24.621 --> 00:59:26.180
Do you miss anything about the rules?

2454
00:59:26.181 --> 00:59:29.410
Cause there's like a lot of debate about like whether or not the pride rules

2455
00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:30.410
where the best rules.

2456
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:34.400
A lot of people think that they favored the more skillful fighter and they were

2457
00:59:34.401 --> 00:59:38.450
more chaotic because they had stopped soccer kicks,

2458
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:39.920
but yet no elbows.

2459
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.120
<v 5>You know,</v>

2460
00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:44.110
I always said elbows and now you know,

2461
00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:47.440
now we see guys start knocking people out with them.

2462
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:51.520
But normally if a fight's get stopped by elbows,

2463
00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:53.500
95% is because of a cut.

2464
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:54.180
No,

2465
00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:55.013
because of a knockout.

2466
00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:55.781
So,

2467
00:59:55.781 --> 00:59:57.700
and then I say that is not a real win.

2468
00:59:57.701 --> 00:59:59.260
If you think about it under the street,

2469
00:59:59.261 --> 00:59:59.930
if you get caught,

2470
00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:00.763
you won't stop by,

2471
01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:01.061
you know,

2472
01:00:01.061 --> 01:00:01.930
you keep on fighting.

2473
01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:02.231
It's not,

2474
01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:04.120
the cut's not going to do anything to you knocking them out.

2475
01:00:04.121 --> 01:00:04.970
And that's why I say no.

2476
01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:08.500
Sometimes I like it even better and east of the phase on the ground and take the

2477
01:00:08.501 --> 01:00:09.550
elbows out for eye care,

2478
01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:10.180
you know?

2479
01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:14.770
And I think the ring makes it also a little bit more technical because you can't

2480
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:15.703
walk out,

2481
01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:16.361
you know,

2482
01:00:16.361 --> 01:00:16.631
just,

2483
01:00:16.631 --> 01:00:18.040
it's a whole different strategy.

2484
01:00:18.041 --> 01:00:18.940
Suddenly you can luck.

2485
01:00:18.941 --> 01:00:19.990
Some people are standing,

2486
01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:21.340
you can lock them up in the corner.

2487
01:00:21.341 --> 01:00:22.360
You can do that in a cage.

2488
01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.000
It see it.

2489
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:23.700
So this is the,

2490
01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.880
it's a whole different strategy.

2491
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.461
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2492
01:00:25.461 --> 01:00:29.450
You can't use the cage to push your back against it to get away.

2493
01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:31.280
You can't reverse people as easily.

2494
01:00:31.281 --> 01:00:32.630
There's a lot the wall,

2495
01:00:32.631 --> 01:00:34.270
I mean the cage is almost like a knife,

2496
01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.300
a weapon in there.

2497
01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:36.350
It's almost like a tool.

2498
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:36.831
<v 5>And now,</v>

2499
01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:38.540
especially now we see pat us,

2500
01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:38.781
you know,

2501
01:00:38.781 --> 01:00:39.870
coming up with the crazy stuff,

2502
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.420
pushing off with a straight bar.

2503
01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:42.110
Is that one I did,

2504
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:42.943
but that cake,

2505
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:43.670
that was,

2506
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:45.020
that was really crazy actually,

2507
01:00:45.021 --> 01:00:48.080
that pushing off and then a within a knee.

2508
01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:50.020
<v 0>Oh,</v>

2509
01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:50.880
the trainer from Gilbert.

2510
01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.630
I IFL all the way back.

2511
01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.340
Lucian Lucian Carbine.

2512
01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:57.850
He used to do that on the bottom rope and Thai boxing and decline.

2513
01:00:57.851 --> 01:01:00.550
She would stomp on the bottom rope and I'm hoping he did the face.

2514
01:01:00.551 --> 01:01:01.630
Did you see um,

2515
01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:01.990
uh,

2516
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:04.150
Anthony Pettis has started throwing knees that way.

2517
01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:04.930
How cool.

2518
01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:08.110
And how did he slipped it around housing the inventory.

2519
01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.580
That defense is crazy.

2520
01:01:09.581 --> 01:01:09.800
Yeah.

2521
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.710
He's got a great time of the fucker.

2522
01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:11.981
Yeah.

2523
01:01:11.981 --> 01:01:12.310
Yes.

2524
01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:12.541
He's,

2525
01:01:12.541 --> 01:01:12.700
I mean,

2526
01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:15.100
cause Donald Cowboy Cerrone is a bad motherfucker too.

2527
01:01:15.101 --> 01:01:18.820
And when he stopped him with a body shot and you could see cowboy didn't want to

2528
01:01:18.821 --> 01:01:19.331
acknowledge it,

2529
01:01:19.331 --> 01:01:21.610
he blasted him once with a kick to the body.

2530
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:23.740
And all you saw was cowboys APP.

2531
01:01:23.741 --> 01:01:26.530
Just thanks for the plug by the way.

2532
01:01:26.531 --> 01:01:31.531
I [inaudible] it's a liver shot like boss route knows the power of the liver

2533
01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.060
shot and he's,

2534
01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:33.401
you know,

2535
01:01:33.401 --> 01:01:34.960
from bosses commentary,

2536
01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:37.080
you've always been so adamant about,

2537
01:01:37.081 --> 01:01:37.390
you know,

2538
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:41.350
attacking the liver folks who don't know on your person when he hit you with a

2539
01:01:41.351 --> 01:01:42.130
left hook,

2540
01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:46.930
there's an area where your liver is where if you take a sizable impact on that

2541
01:01:46.931 --> 01:01:47.650
liver,

2542
01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:50.010
your body just shuts down and it's,

2543
01:01:50.011 --> 01:01:51.850
it's a weird thing to watch.

2544
01:01:51.850 --> 01:01:53.140
It's a weird thing to feel,

2545
01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:53.561
you know,

2546
01:01:53.561 --> 01:01:55.690
everybody's felt that everybody who's ever trained is Felton.

2547
01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.250
My first Thai boxing class,

2548
01:01:57.790 --> 01:01:59.170
I got drunk to deliver shot.

2549
01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:00.620
That's where my love comes from.

2550
01:02:00.621 --> 01:02:01.454
Delivering shunt.

2551
01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:05.530
I was underground breathing and asking him what essay says that I left hook to

2552
01:02:05.531 --> 01:02:06.364
the buddy.

2553
01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:07.151
That's where your liver is.

2554
01:02:07.151 --> 01:02:07.810
Look at it and go,

2555
01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:08.800
oh man.

2556
01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:09.600
And then

2557
01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.900
<v 5>it's when I started focusing because I knew right away I was like all,</v>

2558
01:02:12.901 --> 01:02:15.420
I thought it was a bad ass because I end karate.

2559
01:02:15.421 --> 01:02:18.690
I was beating people up in my a trading in an in taekwondo.

2560
01:02:18.691 --> 01:02:20.040
But when I went to Thai

2561
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.440
<v 4>boxing because we were not used to really punching the hat.</v>

2562
01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:22.890
Yeah.

2563
01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:23.161
You know,

2564
01:02:23.161 --> 01:02:24.630
when they started taking my head,

2565
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.450
my hands flew up way too high of course,

2566
01:02:27.451 --> 01:02:30.930
and exposing overexposing my body and that's where the body shot.

2567
01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:33.010
<v 0>I have the exact same story.</v>

2568
01:02:33.011 --> 01:02:37.240
I started out in taekwondo and realized it was like right around the time,

2569
01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:37.750
um,

2570
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:40.270
I wanted to try to make the u s national team.

2571
01:02:40.271 --> 01:02:44.200
I'd won the Massachusetts State Championship like four years in a row and I won

2572
01:02:44.201 --> 01:02:44.911
the u s cop.

2573
01:02:44.911 --> 01:02:45.490
I want some,

2574
01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:46.600
want some good tournaments,

2575
01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:47.531
but I got,

2576
01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:48.364
or the u s open,

2577
01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:53.370
but I got to the nationals in 1988 by the time I was doing that though,

2578
01:02:54.731 --> 01:02:58.450
I'd already started boxing and I realized I was full of Shit.

2579
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.510
Like I really like everybody that takes karate,

2580
01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:03.760
at least back in the day before the UFC came around,

2581
01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:05.410
everybody that took Judah,

2582
01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.600
everybody that took whatever you took,

2583
01:03:07.601 --> 01:03:09.580
you thought what you had was the shit.

2584
01:03:09.581 --> 01:03:10.210
That was it.

2585
01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:11.320
He didn't need anything else.

2586
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.460
I got super lucky.

2587
01:03:12.461 --> 01:03:13.031
There was a guy named,

2588
01:03:13.031 --> 01:03:17.470
Joe Lake was a great guy who was a boxing coach at this gym that I was working

2589
01:03:17.471 --> 01:03:19.630
out at and I was teaching a taekwondo class there.

2590
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:21.580
And so he started teaching me how to box,

2591
01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:22.990
so I had to teach him some kicks.

2592
01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:26.290
So I was teaching this guy some kicks and then we started doing some sparring

2593
01:03:26.291 --> 01:03:26.620
with a,

2594
01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:30.550
he bringing some boxers that I could spar with and I just got the fuck beat out

2595
01:03:30.551 --> 01:03:30.701
of me.

2596
01:03:30.701 --> 01:03:31.210
And I was like,

2597
01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:32.770
oh Jesus Christ,

2598
01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:34.960
like trying to kick box with these guys.

2599
01:03:34.961 --> 01:03:35.530
It was,

2600
01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:37.180
my hands were so terrible.

2601
01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:37.901
My I did,

2602
01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:41.260
I was so unaware of how easy it was to punch me in the face.

2603
01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:45.490
And I went through that extreme sort of a transition where you realize like,

2604
01:03:45.491 --> 01:03:46.270
wow,

2605
01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:47.170
I got a lot to learn.

2606
01:03:47.171 --> 01:03:47.561
Like I,

2607
01:03:47.561 --> 01:03:51.820
I developed a style that's based on no punching to the face.

2608
01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.380
So it's an unrealistic style.

2609
01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:56.710
But those guys that come from that unrealistic style,

2610
01:03:56.711 --> 01:03:57.850
because there's so many kicks,

2611
01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:02.530
they have a dexterity and the kicking dexterity that very few other guys ever

2612
01:04:02.531 --> 01:04:03.150
develop.

2613
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.301
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

2614
01:04:03.301 --> 01:04:03.451
yeah.

2615
01:04:03.451 --> 01:04:03.601
No,

2616
01:04:03.601 --> 01:04:03.871
it does.

2617
01:04:03.871 --> 01:04:06.540
There's a few guys that kick really fricking hot comb front.

2618
01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:07.650
I call no break arms.

2619
01:04:07.651 --> 01:04:09.270
She knows way that us,

2620
01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:09.541
you know,

2621
01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:10.351
he's a really good point.

2622
01:04:10.351 --> 01:04:11.180
Anderson Silva,

2623
01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.720
the thing that I had though,

2624
01:04:12.721 --> 01:04:14.610
when they beat me up to first class,

2625
01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.040
I went back home and I'd always tell my students,

2626
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:19.170
I always say if I could do what you can do it in.

2627
01:04:19.171 --> 01:04:19.321
Oh,

2628
01:04:19.321 --> 01:04:20.170
because people did a,

2629
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:20.491
they say,

2630
01:04:20.491 --> 01:04:20.671
yeah,

2631
01:04:20.671 --> 01:04:21.600
but it comes easy to me.

2632
01:04:21.601 --> 01:04:22.740
I sure maybe it can,

2633
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:24.210
but I work really hard as well.

2634
01:04:24.211 --> 01:04:24.630
Don't alone.

2635
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:29.460
Don't forget that I stood for hours in front of the mirror with my hands for

2636
01:04:29.461 --> 01:04:31.320
hours and I was not going to drop my hands.

2637
01:04:31.321 --> 01:04:32.410
And my wife at the time said,

2638
01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:33.391
you're crazy.

2639
01:04:33.391 --> 01:04:33.661
I said,

2640
01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:33.811
no,

2641
01:04:33.811 --> 01:04:33.881
no,

2642
01:04:33.881 --> 01:04:33.940
no,

2643
01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:34.590
no.

2644
01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:36.030
This will not happen again.

2645
01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.820
And the next day I went back and I just almost cleaned.

2646
01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:40.400
They cleaned up everybody.

2647
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:41.220
They almost thought,

2648
01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:45.150
they thought that I was pulling a trick on them that already knew how to box.

2649
01:04:45.151 --> 01:04:47.250
So to tie bucks and it was just came in and I said,

2650
01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:47.401
no,

2651
01:04:47.401 --> 01:04:49.560
I spent four hours in front of the mirror yesterday,

2652
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:50.281
my hands,

2653
01:04:50.281 --> 01:04:51.270
and they're going to drive anymore.

2654
01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.760
They guide over the liver shots.

2655
01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:53.640
He's still at the best of me.

2656
01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:54.474
He was really good.

2657
01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.690
Well that's the only way to get great is to be obsessive.

2658
01:04:57.691 --> 01:04:57.871
Right.

2659
01:04:57.871 --> 01:04:58.320
That's it.

2660
01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.160
You gotta be crazy.

2661
01:04:59.400 --> 01:04:59.641
I,

2662
01:04:59.641 --> 01:04:59.731
I,

2663
01:04:59.731 --> 01:05:00.091
you know,

2664
01:05:00.091 --> 01:05:01.280
I tell this story and I,

2665
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.280
you probably heard it before.

2666
01:05:02.281 --> 01:05:04.980
I would wake up my wife in the middle of the night because they would dream of

2667
01:05:04.981 --> 01:05:09.030
submission and then I would put her in that submission I would say,

2668
01:05:09.031 --> 01:05:09.271
hey,

2669
01:05:09.271 --> 01:05:09.841
it's your shoulder,

2670
01:05:09.841 --> 01:05:10.110
right?

2671
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:10.500
Yes.

2672
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.100
My shoulder.

2673
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:14.430
I would write it down and then I would go to sleep in the next day would go,

2674
01:05:14.431 --> 01:05:15.870
and this happens at least six times.

2675
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:18.010
This doesn't happen up and use her as

2676
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.970
<v 2>a grappling dummies.</v>

2677
01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:20.560
I will wake her up and I said,

2678
01:05:20.561 --> 01:05:20.691
man,

2679
01:05:20.691 --> 01:05:21.360
I got another one.

2680
01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:23.230
My whole house was full of little postits.

2681
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:23.831
Yeah,

2682
01:05:23.831 --> 01:05:24.431
I was nuts,

2683
01:05:24.431 --> 01:05:24.680
man.

2684
01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:25.491
I am already hosted.

2685
01:05:25.491 --> 01:05:28.780
Jerry told Mario Sperry told me once that when he was,

2686
01:05:28.781 --> 01:05:29.081
he was,

2687
01:05:29.081 --> 01:05:30.660
when I first to learn Jujitsu,

2688
01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.410
I practice a triangle.

2689
01:05:32.411 --> 01:05:37.000
I have my girlfriend CD in my car and I go back and it said bow and he just

2690
01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:40.020
would practice triangle over and over again and she's just like stabbing on and

2691
01:05:40.021 --> 01:05:41.140
doing my fuck you.

2692
01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:48.280
His girlfriend is a grappling dummy is slapping triangles on it.

2693
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.851
I'm like,

2694
01:05:48.851 --> 01:05:48.940
well,

2695
01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:49.900
she should be honored.

2696
01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:51.520
That's the Mario that's,

2697
01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:52.300
it was buried,

2698
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:55.780
but she's not with him anymore and he married her.

2699
01:05:55.781 --> 01:05:56.231
I don't know,

2700
01:05:56.231 --> 01:05:57.850
maybe it's a maybe a payback.

2701
01:05:58.330 --> 01:05:59.410
You got to see,

2702
01:05:59.470 --> 01:05:59.890
uh,

2703
01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:01.480
in commentating and pride,

2704
01:06:01.481 --> 01:06:04.390
you got to see some of the most historic sites and MMA history.

2705
01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:04.631
Oh,

2706
01:06:04.631 --> 01:06:04.901
I mean,

2707
01:06:04.901 --> 01:06:05.681
those days,

2708
01:06:05.681 --> 01:06:06.580
in my opinion.

2709
01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:07.900
And that's just my opinion.

2710
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:09.161
I look,

2711
01:06:09.161 --> 01:06:09.941
I worked for the UFC.

2712
01:06:09.941 --> 01:06:10.870
Obviously I'm biased.

2713
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:13.180
I think the greatest fighters live today.

2714
01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:13.470
She,

2715
01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:13.710
yeah.

2716
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:13.851
Yeah.

2717
01:06:13.851 --> 01:06:14.684
I think Tj,

2718
01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:15.880
the level of fighters,

2719
01:06:15.881 --> 01:06:16.691
is that a highest,

2720
01:06:16.691 --> 01:06:18.580
the highest level it's ever been in the UFC,

2721
01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:19.900
whether it's Anderson Silva,

2722
01:06:19.901 --> 01:06:20.621
George Saint Pierre,

2723
01:06:20.621 --> 01:06:21.454
Jon Jones,

2724
01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:23.110
that's the highest level it's ever existed.

2725
01:06:23.111 --> 01:06:28.111
But as far as like the greatest events of you were there for those 90,000 seat

2726
01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:30.970
of just [inaudible] 91 and a half.

2727
01:06:30.971 --> 01:06:31.420
They came,

2728
01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.620
parachutes came in.

2729
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:34.800
It was the wildest thing and Gnocchi,

2730
01:06:34.801 --> 01:06:35.131
right?

2731
01:06:35.131 --> 01:06:36.310
He lived with a parachute.

2732
01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:36.900
Yeah.

2733
01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:40.000
I had to cut off the top of the roof was opening the show.

2734
01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:40.811
I mean,

2735
01:06:40.811 --> 01:06:41.644
it was insane.

2736
01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:43.060
It was the craziest to Christ.

2737
01:06:43.061 --> 01:06:46.090
A small show would be 45,000 people.

2738
01:06:46.091 --> 01:06:49.290
Those considered the normal show and was this land?

2739
01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:50.400
How did he go?

2740
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.930
I remember when it started,

2741
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.300
the wind was going really hard and I go,

2742
01:06:55.301 --> 01:06:56.650
this is going to go wrong.

2743
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:59.530
Somebody is going to be like a fly.

2744
01:06:59.531 --> 01:07:00.400
Squatter it up,

2745
01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:03.460
split it up as against whatever is there,

2746
01:07:03.461 --> 01:07:04.660
but I mean they came in,

2747
01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:05.320
they did a,

2748
01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.011
it was phenomenal.

2749
01:07:06.011 --> 01:07:06.790
It was the craziest thing.

2750
01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:09.120
The Japanese sense of pageantry.

2751
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:10.430
Do you want a water or something man?

2752
01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:10.631
No,

2753
01:07:10.631 --> 01:07:10.721
no,

2754
01:07:10.721 --> 01:07:10.871
no.

2755
01:07:10.871 --> 01:07:11.800
That makes it worse with me.

2756
01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:15.430
I'll let like a diet coke for some reason seems to work.

2757
01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.181
Do we have anything?

2758
01:07:16.181 --> 01:07:18.610
I don't think we have a document that ginger ale maybe.

2759
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:18.881
Yeah,

2760
01:07:18.881 --> 01:07:19.840
I'll try coconut water.

2761
01:07:19.841 --> 01:07:21.370
We have coconut water jugs of water.

2762
01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.150
I liked that.

2763
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:23.190
We have coconut water,

2764
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.040
Coco cafe.

2765
01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:25.870
It's coconut water with Espresso in it.

2766
01:07:25.871 --> 01:07:26.560
It's delicious.

2767
01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.270
Won't try that.

2768
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:28.780
I'll try to get me one of them to Jamie.

2769
01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:29.913
Um,

2770
01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:30.820
please.

2771
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:31.530
Uh,

2772
01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:32.051
but the,

2773
01:07:32.051 --> 01:07:34.510
the sense of pageantry that the Japanese,

2774
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:36.430
I still on this TV right here,

2775
01:07:36.431 --> 01:07:39.580
I have best of prides and a lot of times before the,

2776
01:07:39.581 --> 01:07:39.830
uh,

2777
01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:40.160
the,

2778
01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.830
the podcasts,

2779
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:45.130
I'll watch like a bunch of pride fights in a row and if sometimes I forgot,

2780
01:07:45.131 --> 01:07:46.180
I would saying they were,

2781
01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:46.501
you know,

2782
01:07:46.501 --> 01:07:46.680
I,

2783
01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.570
I remembered a time when Dana White was there with chocolate del,

2784
01:07:49.571 --> 01:07:49.871
you know,

2785
01:07:49.871 --> 01:07:52.130
and it was shooting down the first row waiting at a,

2786
01:07:52.131 --> 01:07:55.720
it started and I looked at Dana and he was like,

2787
01:07:55.721 --> 01:07:56.554
whoa.

2788
01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:57.671
I mean,

2789
01:07:57.671 --> 01:07:59.100
and I looked at him and I right.

2790
01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:03.940
It was the craziest ever that coco cafe stuff.

2791
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:04.660
Um,

2792
01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:05.530
we don't,

2793
01:08:05.531 --> 01:08:06.460
these are our sponsors,

2794
01:08:06.461 --> 01:08:07.271
but they're cool people.

2795
01:08:07.271 --> 01:08:08.130
They're sending us bullshit.

2796
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:10.720
It's called Coco cafe and the other stuff that's over there,

2797
01:08:10.721 --> 01:08:12.580
which is unbelievably delicious.

2798
01:08:12.581 --> 01:08:14.680
That's c two o coconut water.

2799
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:15.860
Last time when I was here.

2800
01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:16.830
And you had that.

2801
01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.410
I buy it by the appellate now too.

2802
01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.020
You know what the good is this with the cigar?

2803
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:24.730
<v 0>[inaudible] is a good combination.</v>

2804
01:08:25.090 --> 01:08:25.391
Yeah,

2805
01:08:25.391 --> 01:08:26.260
it's delicious.

2806
01:08:26.261 --> 01:08:28.690
Sweet coconut juice because it's from Thailand.

2807
01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.591
C Two O.

2808
01:08:29.591 --> 01:08:30.010
Um,

2809
01:08:30.010 --> 01:08:30.781
they said that they're,

2810
01:08:30.781 --> 01:08:32.800
those coconut trees are small.

2811
01:08:32.801 --> 01:08:35.200
They're only like five feet tall and not like,

2812
01:08:35.201 --> 01:08:35.350
oh,

2813
01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:35.771
regular,

2814
01:08:35.771 --> 01:08:36.760
crazy coconut tree,

2815
01:08:36.761 --> 01:08:41.761
but it's a Thai coconut that you want Amy and Brian's has the Thai coconut Nctl,

2816
01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:44.810
but sometimes they have the little bubbles in little show aired.

2817
01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:47.050
This one you can get two different ones.

2818
01:08:47.051 --> 01:08:50.890
The green one has a little chunks of coconut as well.

2819
01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.050
That's what I put in my morning shake.

2820
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:57.830
Make a hemp force with a hemp protein or make a shake with a,

2821
01:08:58.130 --> 01:08:58.963
yeah.

2822
01:08:59.530 --> 01:09:01.390
Not even psychoactives good for everything.

2823
01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:01.660
No,

2824
01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:01.870
it's,

2825
01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:02.081
well,

2826
01:09:02.081 --> 01:09:03.250
it is good for loading everything.

2827
01:09:03.251 --> 01:09:04.190
That's what's crazy about it.

2828
01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:04.630
It will.

2829
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:06.340
The hempcrete,

2830
01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:07.174
have you heard of this?

2831
01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:10.010
They got to this hemp concrete and it's,

2832
01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:11.590
it's actually flexible.

2833
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.730
Yeah,

2834
01:09:12.730 --> 01:09:13.563
for real.

2835
01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:17.030
It's called hempcrete and the same,

2836
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:19.600
I said they haven't had to an Olympic stadium.

2837
01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:20.081
Well,

2838
01:09:20.081 --> 01:09:21.340
they're harder than it's hot.

2839
01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:22.360
This is what's crazy.

2840
01:09:22.361 --> 01:09:25.180
They're harder than regular concrete and lighter.

2841
01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:28.380
And because it moves its way better for buildings because it can break,

2842
01:09:28.381 --> 01:09:28.680
you know,

2843
01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.740
ways nice.

2844
01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.690
Hemp is a crazy plan.

2845
01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:32.140
It does.

2846
01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:33.610
It doesn't even seem real.

2847
01:09:33.790 --> 01:09:36.610
And what a lot of people don't know is that it's not,

2848
01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.650
it's when you're talking about,

2849
01:09:38.651 --> 01:09:39.580
like you say,

2850
01:09:39.581 --> 01:09:39.940
hemp,

2851
01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.640
people think you're thinking of my pot and thinking about getting high.

2852
01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:45.030
It has nothing to do with getting high.

2853
01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.260
It has to do with it.

2854
01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:46.751
Yeah.

2855
01:09:46.751 --> 01:09:48.040
What I just mean as a,

2856
01:09:48.041 --> 01:09:49.390
as a product,

2857
01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:50.770
as a commodity,

2858
01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.390
it's an amazing plant.

2859
01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:56.110
Just what can do is you can get the stock like the,

2860
01:09:56.111 --> 01:09:56.351
the,

2861
01:09:56.351 --> 01:09:56.441
uh,

2862
01:09:56.441 --> 01:09:57.274
the base of it.

2863
01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.600
It's hard as a rock,

2864
01:09:58.601 --> 01:10:00.730
but yet it's a light like styrofoam.

2865
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:01.370
It's crazy.

2866
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:02.111
It's an alien.

2867
01:10:02.111 --> 01:10:03.210
It's like an alien planet.

2868
01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:06.070
There's no plan on the planet like him and it's illegal.

2869
01:10:06.071 --> 01:10:10.900
These fuckheads Jesus boss Rutan it's really illegal in Japan,

2870
01:10:10.901 --> 01:10:11.201
right?

2871
01:10:11.201 --> 01:10:11.381
I mean,

2872
01:10:11.381 --> 01:10:13.900
if you get caught in Japan trouble,

2873
01:10:13.901 --> 01:10:14.141
right?

2874
01:10:14.141 --> 01:10:14.380
Yeah,

2875
01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:14.590
yeah,

2876
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:15.423
yeah.

2877
01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.240
Was that weird spending so much time in that,

2878
01:10:18.241 --> 01:10:18.971
that culture?

2879
01:10:18.971 --> 01:10:20.770
Because Brian and I went last year.

2880
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.170
There was a our both of our first time and we were like,

2881
01:10:23.171 --> 01:10:24.040
Holy Shit,

2882
01:10:24.041 --> 01:10:24.940
this place is nuts.

2883
01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:25.401
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2884
01:10:25.401 --> 01:10:25.921
You brought a lot,

2885
01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:26.310
uh,

2886
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.531
the,

2887
01:10:26.531 --> 01:10:26.711
the,

2888
01:10:26.711 --> 01:10:26.981
the,

2889
01:10:26.981 --> 01:10:27.710
the pills,

2890
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:29.030
the THC pills.

2891
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:30.680
Did you bring those love because the legal red,

2892
01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:32.390
you can get them on their prescription.

2893
01:10:32.391 --> 01:10:33.960
What's the name again of those years?

2894
01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:35.450
Yeah.

2895
01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:36.150
Yeah.

2896
01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:36.983
Fuck you up.

2897
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:37.221
Yeah.

2898
01:10:37.221 --> 01:10:38.900
But I mean if you go to Japan,

2899
01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.600
you better bring that you so you want to get high,

2900
01:10:41.601 --> 01:10:42.434
you mean?

2901
01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:42.921
Yeah.

2902
01:10:42.921 --> 01:10:44.240
If you get offered wheat in Japan,

2903
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.601
oh no.

2904
01:10:44.601 --> 01:10:45.650
It's very easy to get there.

2905
01:10:45.651 --> 01:10:45.800
Yeah.

2906
01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:45.981
No,

2907
01:10:45.981 --> 01:10:46.180
it's,

2908
01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:49.170
if you go through a bong gets all crazy things that,

2909
01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:49.330
yeah,

2910
01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:50.510
all those African dudes,

2911
01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.800
those African Jews are wandering the streets trying to offer you a massage.

2912
01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:54.610
Is that where we went?

2913
01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:55.443
Capone Gay.

2914
01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.131
That's the one.

2915
01:10:58.131 --> 01:10:59.150
That's the place I went to.

2916
01:10:59.151 --> 01:11:00.320
Like I said before,

2917
01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:02.913
that's what you were going,

2918
01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:03.341
yeah,

2919
01:11:03.341 --> 01:11:03.720
that's it.

2920
01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.340
They were funky.

2921
01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:05.173
That was it.

2922
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:06.560
Was it weird though,

2923
01:11:06.561 --> 01:11:08.900
being over in that culture like on a regular basis?

2924
01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.810
I have a buddy with me,

2925
01:11:11.811 --> 01:11:14.070
so [inaudible] young and I know for four years been

2926
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.660
<v 4>bullied as was a kid until you know,</v>

2927
01:11:15.661 --> 01:11:19.110
also stood up and not to bully out and start getting any wants to start

2928
01:11:19.111 --> 01:11:19.381
fighting.

2929
01:11:19.381 --> 01:11:23.100
And he's coming out here also and he's here for the first weekend and he wants

2930
01:11:23.101 --> 01:11:24.300
to stay for three months to train.

2931
01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:25.411
And he also said,

2932
01:11:25.411 --> 01:11:25.651
you know,

2933
01:11:25.651 --> 01:11:25.951
yeah,

2934
01:11:25.951 --> 01:11:26.820
it's hard to,

2935
01:11:26.821 --> 01:11:27.031
you know,

2936
01:11:27.031 --> 01:11:27.691
your family.

2937
01:11:27.691 --> 01:11:28.530
And he especially,

2938
01:11:28.531 --> 01:11:28.711
you know,

2939
01:11:28.711 --> 01:11:30.840
because he's used to his family all the time around.

2940
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.651
And I said,

2941
01:11:31.651 --> 01:11:31.891
you know,

2942
01:11:31.891 --> 01:11:34.180
I know exactly what you're going through because I had that deal with sometimes

2943
01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:35.310
I went five weeks over there,

2944
01:11:35.311 --> 01:11:37.410
I was a hotel room and it was it,

2945
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:37.801
you know,

2946
01:11:37.801 --> 01:11:38.500
you go in the morning,

2947
01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.010
go train,

2948
01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:39.511
you go back,

2949
01:11:39.511 --> 01:11:39.981
you eat,

2950
01:11:39.981 --> 01:11:40.870
you go train,

2951
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:42.050
you go back and then you,

2952
01:11:42.051 --> 01:11:42.361
you know,

2953
01:11:42.361 --> 01:11:42.841
that's it.

2954
01:11:42.841 --> 01:11:43.980
And then you'll video games.

2955
01:11:43.981 --> 01:11:45.070
I was very good at fortune.

2956
01:11:45.071 --> 01:11:45.751
What fight or you know,

2957
01:11:45.751 --> 01:11:47.820
like blame these big video games there.

2958
01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:48.870
But that's,

2959
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:50.670
there is nobody to communicate.

2960
01:11:50.671 --> 01:11:52.260
There's no going out district.

2961
01:11:52.261 --> 01:11:54.480
The only thing they have is a Roppongi.

2962
01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.990
But for the rest is not like he can walk into a bar somewhere.

2963
01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:57.391
It's not.

2964
01:11:57.391 --> 01:11:59.460
Plus you don't want to do that because you're in training.

2965
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.810
Right.

2966
01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:00.061
You know,

2967
01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:01.410
so it's uh,

2968
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:01.681
yeah,

2969
01:12:01.681 --> 01:12:02.280
it's hard.

2970
01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.021
It's hard to,

2971
01:12:03.021 --> 01:12:03.990
at that moment to be there.

2972
01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.050
This is very weird,

2973
01:12:05.051 --> 01:12:06.810
but the people are completely different.

2974
01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:07.680
You know,

2975
01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.610
it's quiet.

2976
01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.510
Everything is,

2977
01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:10.540
yeah,

2978
01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:11.050
it's a,

2979
01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:13.530
it's a weird feeling to me though.

2980
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:16.890
I truly believe that it completely changed my fighting style.

2981
01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.990
I was a super aggressive fighter.

2982
01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.180
That's why I put this big arts on my hand in the beginning.

2983
01:12:21.181 --> 01:12:23.550
But in Holland I will come out very technical,

2984
01:12:23.551 --> 01:12:24.031
you know,

2985
01:12:24.031 --> 01:12:24.671
Poem Jab,

2986
01:12:24.671 --> 01:12:25.151
Low k,

2987
01:12:25.151 --> 01:12:25.471
cup up,

2988
01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:25.621
up,

2989
01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:25.801
up,

2990
01:12:25.801 --> 01:12:26.200
up.

2991
01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.033
I will get hit.

2992
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:32.010
You know what it was like disconnect and then it would just tear them up.

2993
01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:32.160
I,

2994
01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.340
that's why I got like 13 first round knockouts,

2995
01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:34.861
you know,

2996
01:12:34.861 --> 01:12:36.540
just blasted people over this.

2997
01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:37.560
Wouldn't we hit him out of the ring?

2998
01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:39.540
Almost just totally lost control.

2999
01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:41.220
He would try to start our technical,

3000
01:12:41.221 --> 01:12:42.590
but then you'd just get crazy when you go,

3001
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:42.931
oh,

3002
01:12:42.931 --> 01:12:44.850
I got to hit that and I got so angry and I,

3003
01:12:44.851 --> 01:12:46.490
and then when I went to Japan I realized,

3004
01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:49.290
well these guys are known to to take a hit,

3005
01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:50.011
you know?

3006
01:12:50.011 --> 01:12:50.940
And I figured if I,

3007
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.790
when I found out that there was the funniest part,

3008
01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:54.540
no way classes.

3009
01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.570
So my guy was two 45 I go and that's not a problem here.

3010
01:12:57.571 --> 01:12:57.751
No.

3011
01:12:57.751 --> 01:12:57.961
I said,

3012
01:12:57.961 --> 01:12:58.261
okay,

3013
01:12:58.261 --> 01:12:58.441
good,

3014
01:12:58.441 --> 01:12:58.591
good,

3015
01:12:58.591 --> 01:12:58.771
good.

3016
01:12:58.771 --> 01:12:59.581
So I'm bluffing now,

3017
01:12:59.581 --> 01:13:00.090
right?

3018
01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:00.391
I says,

3019
01:13:00.391 --> 01:13:00.970
well how many runs?

3020
01:13:00.970 --> 01:13:01.261
We got?

3021
01:13:01.261 --> 01:13:01.770
Five.

3022
01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:02.041
They said,

3023
01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:02.530
no one run.

3024
01:13:02.530 --> 01:13:02.731
I said,

3025
01:13:02.731 --> 01:13:03.210
well great,

3026
01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:03.800
how many minutes?

3027
01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:04.410
30 I said,

3028
01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:04.740
Oh yeah,

3029
01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:04.921
great,

3030
01:13:04.921 --> 01:13:05.111
great,

3031
01:13:05.111 --> 01:13:05.291
great,

3032
01:13:05.291 --> 01:13:05.451
great,

3033
01:13:05.451 --> 01:13:06.000
great.

3034
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.380
But in my mind I went,

3035
01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:09.140
Fuck.

3036
01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:09.973
And

3037
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.020
so that's why I put the arms on my head.

3038
01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:13.854
I go,

3039
01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:14.761
yeah,

3040
01:13:14.761 --> 01:13:15.151
if I,

3041
01:13:15.151 --> 01:13:18.780
if I unload myself the first two minutes I got 28 minutes to go,

3042
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:19.561
you know,

3043
01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:20.640
I don't want to take that risk.

3044
01:13:20.641 --> 01:13:22.130
And you like that better?

3045
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:23.261
Do you prefer?

3046
01:13:23.261 --> 01:13:23.621
And like,

3047
01:13:23.621 --> 01:13:26.070
like when you see like the pride 10 minute round,

3048
01:13:26.071 --> 01:13:26.791
the opening round,

3049
01:13:26.791 --> 01:13:28.530
there's a lot of debate about that as well.

3050
01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:29.461
Whether or not the,

3051
01:13:29.461 --> 01:13:29.550
uh,

3052
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:32.270
the 10 minute opening round is better or the three five,

3053
01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:32.880
you know.

3054
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.211
Well,

3055
01:13:33.211 --> 01:13:33.311
I,

3056
01:13:33.311 --> 01:13:35.270
I get tell you what they did 10 minute opening round,

3057
01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:35.760
uh,

3058
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.940
makes for a better strategical fighter that that's for sure.

3059
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:39.803
Because you got,

3060
01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:44.430
people have no cool how techy can get in one minutes or in it too much.

3061
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.550
I have these one minute drills that are doing the bag that pros come in and they

3062
01:13:48.551 --> 01:13:49.740
go home and he mine,

3063
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:50.041
you know,

3064
01:13:50.041 --> 01:13:50.371
I mean,

3065
01:13:50.371 --> 01:13:52.350
but I go berzerk you know,

3066
01:13:52.351 --> 01:13:53.280
give you combination.

3067
01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:54.810
Everything is 100%.

3068
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:56.280
You know,

3069
01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.900
saying this before I forget,

3070
01:13:57.901 --> 01:13:59.510
someone's been asking on the underground can,

3071
01:13:59.511 --> 01:14:00.210
do you still,

3072
01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:02.520
do you still sell those Bas Rutten workout tapes?

3073
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:03.000
Yeah.

3074
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.820
Still every month I used to get to finally using it.

3075
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:08.940
[inaudible] dot com [inaudible] dot com you sell it.

3076
01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:09.270
Okay.

3077
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.510
Yup.

3078
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:10.050
Because a,

3079
01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:14.750
there was a bunch of people that were a on mixed martial arts.com MMA out.

3080
01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:17.260
You will have that workout is going to be your best friend.

3081
01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.000
When I trained myself,

3082
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:21.140
it's always part of my work for real.

3083
01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.320
Once you did it ever with the numbers,

3084
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:24.100
it's great.

3085
01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:25.570
It's great because you can do it anywhere.

3086
01:14:25.571 --> 01:14:26.500
You can do it in the,

3087
01:14:26.501 --> 01:14:27.071
in the hotel.

3088
01:14:27.071 --> 01:14:28.090
I was in the hotel room,

3089
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.070
I put the band to the side with the sprawls and everything.

3090
01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.630
It was quite fun.

3091
01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:33.520
It's a fun workout.

3092
01:14:33.521 --> 01:14:33.910
Yeah,

3093
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:34.540
I love that.

3094
01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:35.800
But the 10 minutes opening route,

3095
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:36.820
if you overstretch yourself,

3096
01:14:36.821 --> 01:14:38.360
shoot yourself in the beginning of the round,

3097
01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:39.191
you know,

3098
01:14:39.191 --> 01:14:39.301
you,

3099
01:14:39.301 --> 01:14:42.550
you're going to have eight minutes left and eight minutes is a very long time,

3100
01:14:42.551 --> 01:14:42.851
you know,

3101
01:14:42.851 --> 01:14:43.090
to,

3102
01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:43.990
to come back from that.

3103
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:45.670
So I truly believe you know,

3104
01:14:45.671 --> 01:14:45.891
you,

3105
01:14:45.891 --> 01:14:47.900
you play always that danger as an uh,

3106
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:49.240
as a fighter.

3107
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:51.280
That's why I'll always send to all my guys,

3108
01:14:51.281 --> 01:14:53.520
the 38 year old guy who I said we're starting fighting.

3109
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:56.020
I said stamina is going to be your number one goal.

3110
01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:57.131
The technique.

3111
01:14:57.131 --> 01:14:57.611
We put that.

3112
01:14:57.611 --> 01:14:58.444
Number two,

3113
01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.980
I want stamina at one.

3114
01:15:00.230 --> 01:15:00.430
Right.

3115
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:00.701
You know,

3116
01:15:00.701 --> 01:15:02.380
because if you run out of gas,

3117
01:15:02.381 --> 01:15:04.420
you can have a hundred black belts is not going to save you.

3118
01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:05.590
You're going to get knocked out.

3119
01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.270
And he really did that.

3120
01:15:07.271 --> 01:15:08.710
He can go and especially with amateurs,

3121
01:15:08.711 --> 01:15:11.260
you get short rounds peak and blast them all day long.

3122
01:15:11.261 --> 01:15:11.640
He's never,

3123
01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.490
and that's how we,

3124
01:15:12.491 --> 01:15:12.731
you know,

3125
01:15:12.731 --> 01:15:15.480
he had a heart first round and then the guy started getting more tired and then

3126
01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:18.520
the third round here he just destroyed the guy knocked him out.

3127
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:20.240
And that's what finding you,

3128
01:15:20.241 --> 01:15:21.980
you play a little bit of a risk factor.

3129
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:23.410
That's why I always trained so hard.

3130
01:15:23.411 --> 01:15:25.270
I didn't want to have that risk factor in there.

3131
01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.800
I never run out of gas in my life.

3132
01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:27.011
Yeah.

3133
01:15:27.011 --> 01:15:31.240
You were never a guy that had a short gas tank even in the cold Soka fight where

3134
01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.860
you couldn't train grappling.

3135
01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:33.190
Yup.

3136
01:15:33.190 --> 01:15:34.660
And he took you down and he was,

3137
01:15:34.661 --> 01:15:34.931
you know,

3138
01:15:34.931 --> 01:15:36.830
he's basically trying to out grapple you in that fight.

3139
01:15:36.831 --> 01:15:37.664
He didn't want to stand with you.

3140
01:15:37.670 --> 01:15:40.900
You still manage to have the conditioning to take them out on the feet.

3141
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:41.200
Yeah.

3142
01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:41.510
Yeah.

3143
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:42.250
Look a sacrifice.

3144
01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:42.760
It was also,

3145
01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.290
I will show my backdoor escapes with,

3146
01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:44.680
uh,

3147
01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.550
and I always said,

3148
01:15:45.551 --> 01:15:46.180
uh,

3149
01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:46.391
I said,

3150
01:15:46.391 --> 01:15:47.040
watch that fight.

3151
01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:47.980
He takes me down.

3152
01:15:47.981 --> 01:15:48.210
She,

3153
01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:48.820
how long,

3154
01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:49.690
how long has gotten me,

3155
01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:50.411
I think what,

3156
01:15:50.411 --> 01:15:51.550
20 seconds I'm out.

3157
01:15:51.810 --> 01:15:52.110
You know,

3158
01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:53.470
it's just backdoor escapes.

3159
01:15:53.471 --> 01:15:55.480
But I would go over and over and over again.

3160
01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:55.750
You know,

3161
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:56.410
I will,

3162
01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:57.660
when I do something to enjoy yoga,

3163
01:15:57.730 --> 01:15:58.180
I do,

3164
01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:58.571
I do.

3165
01:15:58.571 --> 01:16:00.040
It is black and white with me.

3166
01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.810
I'll go all the way and,

3167
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.550
and,

3168
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:03.250
and more.

3169
01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:06.130
Will you styles always very interesting to me.

3170
01:16:06.131 --> 01:16:06.331
It's,

3171
01:16:06.331 --> 01:16:06.851
it's always,

3172
01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:10.300
it's fascinating how many different people have a different approach.

3173
01:16:10.301 --> 01:16:13.150
Like Nick Diaz is approach where he throws like,

3174
01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:16.120
he'll hit you with like 50% punches.

3175
01:16:16.121 --> 01:16:17.470
He'll just come at you like,

3176
01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.780
have you seen the video of him shadowboxing by the way?

3177
01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:21.040
Or a hitting the speed bag.

3178
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:22.330
Brion pull this up.

3179
01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:27.130
Nick Diaz hits the fucking speed bag for 23 minutes in a row.

3180
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:28.383
Wow.

3181
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.860
It's insane.

3182
01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.800
And I was one to three minutes in a row.

3183
01:16:31.810 --> 01:16:33.250
I did this five minute rounds,

3184
01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:34.870
three minutes,

3185
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:35.290
and then,

3186
01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:36.123
oh,

3187
01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:36.993
by the way,

3188
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:39.550
he had ridden his bike 15 fucking miles.

3189
01:16:40.210 --> 01:16:41.043
I'm not bullshitting.

3190
01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:42.910
He rode his bike 15 miles to the gym,

3191
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.200
sparred five,

3192
01:16:44.201 --> 01:16:45.430
five minute rounds,

3193
01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:50.640
hit the pads and then does this 23 fucking do anything with me as though I'll do

3194
01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:52.600
one,

3195
01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.080
one,

3196
01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:54.640
one I don't do about dig it,

3197
01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:55.360
dig it.

3198
01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.350
I don't do that and I go date.

3199
01:16:56.351 --> 01:16:56.501
They get,

3200
01:16:56.501 --> 01:16:56.651
they get,

3201
01:16:56.651 --> 01:16:56.990
they get to get,

3202
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:58.840
I go like really fast like that,

3203
01:16:59.440 --> 01:16:59.741
you know?

3204
01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:00.730
But that is crazy.

3205
01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:01.750
That is really,

3206
01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:02.021
yes.

3207
01:17:02.021 --> 01:17:02.481
No liked it.

3208
01:17:02.481 --> 01:17:03.010
Essence.

3209
01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:03.840
It's amazing.

3210
01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:04.440
I mean he's,

3211
01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.930
he's got incredible conditioning and he's a,

3212
01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:07.331
you know,

3213
01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:09.240
he's a couple of days away from the fight.

3214
01:17:09.241 --> 01:17:10.074
That's this weekend,

3215
01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.250
<v 0>this Saturday night,</v>

3216
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:13.170
George Saint Pierre and him are going down.

3217
01:17:13.171 --> 01:17:13.980
It's going to be crazy.

3218
01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:14.490
Oh,

3219
01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:15.250
in Montreal.

3220
01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:17.950
<v 6>This is 23 minutes of this.</v>

3221
01:17:17.951 --> 01:17:21.010
He does this boss and at the end of it all,

3222
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:22.060
he's not even that tired.

3223
01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:23.051
I mean,

3224
01:17:23.051 --> 01:17:23.831
it's fucking crazy.

3225
01:17:23.831 --> 01:17:26.350
This guy's not doing this at a slow pace.

3226
01:17:26.351 --> 01:17:27.184
Look at this.

3227
01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:30.760
Nick Diaz has,

3228
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:31.720
in my opinion,

3229
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:34.030
he's got the best cardio in in all of them.

3230
01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:35.830
But you see he's doing what I said.

3231
01:17:35.831 --> 01:17:37.810
He don't just do it more than other people.

3232
01:17:37.811 --> 01:17:39.490
Look at this man just saying,

3233
01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.170
if he does this for 23 minutes yet,

3234
01:17:41.230 --> 01:17:44.920
guess why he doesn't get burned out in a shoulders cause I always doing it

3235
01:17:44.921 --> 01:17:47.140
because the reason he does it so often,

3236
01:17:47.170 --> 01:17:47.951
and by the way,

3237
01:17:47.951 --> 01:17:48.880
when he's not doing it,

3238
01:17:48.881 --> 01:17:50.530
he's fucking doing triathlons.

3239
01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:53.140
The guys swam from Alcatraz twice,

3240
01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:53.780
you know?

3241
01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:54.191
Crazy.

3242
01:17:54.191 --> 01:17:56.320
You have to be in the water up there.

3243
01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.720
Phil would sharks.

3244
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:58.583
Yeah.

3245
01:17:58.610 --> 01:18:00.410
<v 5>Great White Meeting Habitat.</v>

3246
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:05.800
That was a big a myth also right at that time that they put planet people's

3247
01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.940
heads so they wouldn't start swimming back.

3248
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.550
Oh No.

3249
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:11.090
It's just stream is that is the worst.

3250
01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.490
The stream that that takes people out there.

3251
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.721
Most dangerous.

3252
01:18:14.721 --> 01:18:14.961
Yeah.

3253
01:18:14.961 --> 01:18:15.794
The time.

3254
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:16.221
Yeah.

3255
01:18:16.221 --> 01:18:16.520
There's,

3256
01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.810
there's a lot of shit is dangerous.

3257
01:18:17.811 --> 01:18:18.251
First of all.

3258
01:18:18.251 --> 01:18:18.470
Water.

3259
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:19.820
It's really fucking cold up there.

3260
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:20.030
Yeah.

3261
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.570
Yeah.

3262
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:21.320
But you know what?

3263
01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.190
That's what I say again.

3264
01:18:22.191 --> 01:18:23.830
What he got this you can do,

3265
01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.410
do you just have to do it?

3266
01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:26.031
You just have to do it,

3267
01:18:26.031 --> 01:18:26.270
you know,

3268
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:27.170
and that's what the people were.

3269
01:18:27.171 --> 01:18:29.030
They run it against go run a fricking hill man.

3270
01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.120
I mean that's what I used.

3271
01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.160
<v 0>One of the things that you said or you said,</v>

3272
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:34.060
uh,

3273
01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:34.260
you,

3274
01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:35.620
you said I would do one round,

3275
01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:36.760
I would start out one minute.

3276
01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:37.240
Yup.

3277
01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:40.510
And I would go full clip and then next time I don't want a minute and a half and

3278
01:18:40.511 --> 01:18:42.070
then eventually you build up.

3279
01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:42.640
That's it.

3280
01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.473
But you got to,

3281
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:45.100
that was your style of doing it though.

3282
01:18:45.190 --> 01:18:45.380
<v 5>And,</v>

3283
01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:46.250
and you know what I do,

3284
01:18:46.251 --> 01:18:48.440
I have those one minute drills on a bag.

3285
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:49.340
I have all that.

3286
01:18:49.341 --> 01:18:50.070
We'll be focusing.

3287
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.541
It's a type,

3288
01:18:50.541 --> 01:18:51.770
it's what you just talked about.

3289
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:53.960
But I will take it even easier.

3290
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:55.760
What I will do is one minute on the bag,

3291
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.960
one minute rest and I will do 15 rounds as 30 minutes.

3292
01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:01.490
Then I would go to next week,

3293
01:19:01.491 --> 01:19:03.260
one minute of five seconds on the back,

3294
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:06.500
55 seconds rest next week for one minute,

3295
01:19:06.501 --> 01:19:07.250
10 seconds,

3296
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:08.420
56 every time,

3297
01:19:08.421 --> 01:19:12.530
five seconds more and five seconds away from your rest time at the end you're at

3298
01:19:12.531 --> 01:19:17.531
one and a half minute going crazy on the back of every punch is dis through hit

3299
01:19:19.311 --> 01:19:20.300
through someone's head,

3300
01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:23.480
like there's not one half point and then what have you done in like 30 seconds

3301
01:19:23.481 --> 01:19:24.890
rest and then 30 seconds for us,

3302
01:19:24.891 --> 01:19:26.180
one and a half minutes fall.

3303
01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:27.260
You see guys in,

3304
01:19:27.261 --> 01:19:27.520
in,

3305
01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:28.190
um,

3306
01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:32.480
in fight it and fight who suddenly unload themselves for 20,

3307
01:19:32.481 --> 01:19:33.830
30 seconds and the guest out.

3308
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:34.151
Right?

3309
01:19:34.151 --> 01:19:34.370
Right.

3310
01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:35.360
How many times do you see that?

3311
01:19:35.361 --> 01:19:36.050
How many times?

3312
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:36.231
Well,

3313
01:19:36.231 --> 01:19:37.130
there's the drill for you.

3314
01:19:37.131 --> 01:19:37.940
This,

3315
01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:38.271
you know,

3316
01:19:38.271 --> 01:19:39.530
you're going to be bizarre,

3317
01:19:39.531 --> 01:19:41.720
strong and every time it's just five seconds more,

3318
01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:42.290
you know,

3319
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:42.801
every week.

3320
01:19:42.801 --> 01:19:47.660
So if she was fine slowly and that you do together with the other drills that I

3321
01:19:47.661 --> 01:19:50.270
said going to the fight for the six minutes,

3322
01:19:50.271 --> 01:19:50.410
right.

3323
01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:50.500
From

3324
01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:53.090
<v 0>what I was getting at with the Nick Diaz thing was that it's,</v>

3325
01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:55.540
it's so interesting to see the different styles.

3326
01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:58.630
Like the way nick approaches it where he just says a lot of volume.

3327
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:59.101
Volume.

3328
01:19:59.101 --> 01:19:59.310
Yeah.

3329
01:19:59.310 --> 01:20:02.650
He doesn't blast you full blast with every shot.

3330
01:20:02.651 --> 01:20:04.360
Whereas you had a different style.

3331
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:05.980
You would even when you would,

3332
01:20:05.981 --> 01:20:07.330
you would kick their arms,

3333
01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.160
you would try

3334
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.150
<v 2>to crush them.</v>

3335
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.230
You try to break down.

3336
01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:11.220
I'm afraid of it.

3337
01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:11.941
Like I say,

3338
01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:16.170
if somebody puts his defense off up kick as hard as she can on a defense put in

3339
01:20:16.171 --> 01:20:17.680
his head that I bet a blog this,

3340
01:20:17.681 --> 01:20:18.660
because if I don't look at,

3341
01:20:18.661 --> 01:20:18.871
you know,

3342
01:20:18.871 --> 01:20:19.750
now you're inside his head,

3343
01:20:19.751 --> 01:20:19.880
do you?

3344
01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:20.581
She already great.

3345
01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:23.370
But Nick Diaz hips has a different muscles than I have.

3346
01:20:23.371 --> 01:20:24.630
I have the fast twitch fibers.

3347
01:20:24.631 --> 01:20:27.870
A lot of guys that they have that they burn a lot but he doesn't have,

3348
01:20:27.871 --> 01:20:29.670
he had to slow twitch fibers and I'm not,

3349
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:30.930
that doesn't mean it's slow,

3350
01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:32.340
but I mean it has a different,

3351
01:20:32.341 --> 01:20:33.670
he is the the insurance guy.

3352
01:20:33.671 --> 01:20:34.770
So a lot of them have that,

3353
01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:35.521
you know,

3354
01:20:35.521 --> 01:20:37.050
but all the explosive guys,

3355
01:20:37.051 --> 01:20:39.480
they really have to watch out how they fight,

3356
01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:40.121
burst,

3357
01:20:40.121 --> 01:20:40.500
look,

3358
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.020
relax,

3359
01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:41.491
burst,

3360
01:20:41.491 --> 01:20:41.881
relax.

3361
01:20:41.881 --> 01:20:45.120
You know you have to fight like a train like that because otherwise you run

3362
01:20:45.121 --> 01:20:45.451
against,

3363
01:20:45.451 --> 01:20:48.840
that's why you see all those super explosive guys they run out against and

3364
01:20:48.841 --> 01:20:50.940
that's the reason because they don't train like that.

3365
01:20:51.330 --> 01:20:53.310
One of the things that are Chael Sonnen serve,

3366
01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:55.260
he said that if you try to knock a guy out,

3367
01:20:55.261 --> 01:20:56.640
if you feel like you have an opportunity,

3368
01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:58.110
you try to knock the guy out.

3369
01:20:58.230 --> 01:20:59.340
If you don't knock them out,

3370
01:20:59.341 --> 01:21:00.810
you're probably not going to win a decision.

3371
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.321
Like,

3372
01:21:01.321 --> 01:21:02.220
do you have to realize you're,

3373
01:21:02.221 --> 01:21:03.330
you're gambling at all.

3374
01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:03.520
Yeah.

3375
01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:04.770
But Guy Survives it.

3376
01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:05.791
You might be,

3377
01:21:05.791 --> 01:21:06.840
might be out of gas.

3378
01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:07.351
Yeah.

3379
01:21:07.351 --> 01:21:08.790
But she all has the same thing.

3380
01:21:08.791 --> 01:21:10.110
It was also no knockout power.

3381
01:21:10.111 --> 01:21:10.331
You know.

3382
01:21:10.331 --> 01:21:11.430
He just told us volume,

3383
01:21:11.431 --> 01:21:11.761
volume,

3384
01:21:11.761 --> 01:21:12.091
volume,

3385
01:21:12.091 --> 01:21:12.431
volume.

3386
01:21:12.431 --> 01:21:13.170
You're like,

3387
01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:13.960
uh,

3388
01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:14.290
uh,

3389
01:21:14.290 --> 01:21:14.840
Nick Diaz,

3390
01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:15.420
he's got,

3391
01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:16.470
he's got knockout power.

3392
01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:16.921
If he wants,

3393
01:21:16.921 --> 01:21:17.870
he can drop on,

3394
01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:18.421
you know,

3395
01:21:18.421 --> 01:21:19.051
but you see it,

3396
01:21:19.051 --> 01:21:19.940
you can be chill.

3397
01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:22.860
He has got an incredible stamina is c and that's those,

3398
01:21:22.890 --> 01:21:23.190
those,

3399
01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:24.120
those muscles.

3400
01:21:24.210 --> 01:21:25.500
It's wrapping on the dude.

3401
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:26.160
Yeah,

3402
01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:26.993
yeah,

3403
01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:27.481
yeah.

3404
01:21:27.481 --> 01:21:28.060
It's a,

3405
01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:32.100
it's just such a fascinating thing to see guys start to put it all together.

3406
01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:33.270
And also the sea,

3407
01:21:33.271 --> 01:21:37.350
the whole style changing where these guys like these Roy McDonald guys that can

3408
01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:40.260
do everything are starting to sort of move ahead.

3409
01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.190
And it was explosive,

3410
01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.580
explosive also and does a lot of explosive drills.

3411
01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.050
He received his workouts.

3412
01:21:46.051 --> 01:21:47.860
He's doing a lot of like jumping over a,

3413
01:21:47.890 --> 01:21:49.350
those horses,

3414
01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:49.771
you know,

3415
01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:50.320
those uh,

3416
01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.153
saw horses,

3417
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:53.340
those barriers,

3418
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.911
what do they call?

3419
01:21:53.911 --> 01:21:54.450
Hurdles.

3420
01:21:54.450 --> 01:21:54.960
Hurdle.

3421
01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.830
A lot of hurdle jumping.

3422
01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:57.630
A lot of like power lifting.

3423
01:21:57.631 --> 01:22:01.230
A lot of like all the strength and conditioning shit that you see with like pro

3424
01:22:01.231 --> 01:22:02.070
football players,

3425
01:22:02.071 --> 01:22:03.090
pro hockey players.

3426
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:04.380
That's what you're seeing now.

3427
01:22:04.381 --> 01:22:04.501
He's,

3428
01:22:04.501 --> 01:22:06.060
you see him like real athletes.

3429
01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:06.600
Yep.

3430
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:11.400
And also guys that have multifaceted attacks for the longest time,

3431
01:22:11.401 --> 01:22:12.121
like I've always said like,

3432
01:22:12.121 --> 01:22:12.331
gosh,

3433
01:22:12.331 --> 01:22:14.550
she's throwing my leg kicks and people would get pissed at me.

3434
01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:15.031
They're like,

3435
01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:15.960
why do you keep saying that?

3436
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.100
You know he's doing well on his own.

3437
01:22:17.101 --> 01:22:17.760
I'm like,

3438
01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.593
because it's not,

3439
01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:19.861
you can do better.

3440
01:22:19.861 --> 01:22:20.161
Yeah.

3441
01:22:20.161 --> 01:22:20.410
I mean,

3442
01:22:20.410 --> 01:22:21.950
and whom I did say it well,

3443
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:22.231
yeah,

3444
01:22:22.231 --> 01:22:22.711
who am I?

3445
01:22:22.711 --> 01:22:24.930
But I'm also a guy seen a thousand fights and I,

3446
01:22:24.931 --> 01:22:26.370
I know what people,

3447
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.960
some people can do.

3448
01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.760
I know there are guys,

3449
01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:32.850
when you see a guy like Anderson Silva who basically we can do everything.

3450
01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:34.230
And when you see that guy,

3451
01:22:34.231 --> 01:22:35.850
you know that those guys are possible.

3452
01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:37.440
So when you see a guy who doesn't,

3453
01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:40.560
or when you see a guy like George St Pierre who makes it so unpredictable,

3454
01:22:40.561 --> 01:22:41.221
what he's going to do,

3455
01:22:41.221 --> 01:22:43.320
whether he's going to punch you or try to take you down.

3456
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.480
And that's part of why he so effective.

3457
01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.800
It's because he's,

3458
01:22:46.801 --> 01:22:47.101
you know,

3459
01:22:47.101 --> 01:22:47.970
he's moving,

3460
01:22:47.971 --> 01:22:48.960
he moves really well.

3461
01:22:48.961 --> 01:22:50.220
It covers distance really well.

3462
01:22:50.221 --> 01:22:52.010
And you don't know if he's shooting a double over,

3463
01:22:52.030 --> 01:22:53.040
he's throwing a punch at you.

3464
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:53.850
You don't know.

3465
01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:54.780
He makes you mix.

3466
01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.130
It makes you worry about it.

3467
01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:57.840
He's like the La Jolla I used to do,

3468
01:22:57.850 --> 01:23:02.100
you know how you would go to a fight and every time he will bring a new thing to

3469
01:23:02.101 --> 01:23:04.570
a fight and that will be his focus on and,

3470
01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:04.950
and,

3471
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:06.370
and GSB has the same thing.

3472
01:23:06.371 --> 01:23:07.890
Lifers is when he fought shake,

3473
01:23:07.891 --> 01:23:08.724
it was to Jab,

3474
01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:09.490
Jab,

3475
01:23:09.490 --> 01:23:10.450
and it was that spinning back.

3476
01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:13.600
He comes with two or three things and he will throw that the most.

3477
01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:15.550
And in between he adlibs and he,

3478
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:19.240
he does all the rest that he knows the spinning backwards from him working with

3479
01:23:19.241 --> 01:23:19.750
me.

3480
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:20.560
Oh yeah.

3481
01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.330
The whole video of me teaching them how to do it.

3482
01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:22.841
Oh Nice.

3483
01:23:22.841 --> 01:23:22.960
I,

3484
01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:23.910
we were at a,

3485
01:23:23.911 --> 01:23:27.160
at legends and Hollywood and it was the most ridiculous conversation.

3486
01:23:27.161 --> 01:23:30.370
I was talking to John Donner and he was looking for someone to teach George

3487
01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:31.900
Saint Pierre how to throw a spinning back kick.

3488
01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:32.471
He was asking me,

3489
01:23:32.471 --> 01:23:33.760
do you know any good talk when no guys,

3490
01:23:33.810 --> 01:23:34.121
here we go.

3491
01:23:34.121 --> 01:23:34.511
I'm going to go.

3492
01:23:34.511 --> 01:23:36.070
This is gonna sound crazy.

3493
01:23:36.071 --> 01:23:37.210
You're not going to believe me.

3494
01:23:37.211 --> 01:23:37.481
I go,

3495
01:23:37.481 --> 01:23:39.670
but I got to fucking nasty tourney sock take.

3496
01:23:39.671 --> 01:23:41.650
It was like my number one technique I could show him.

3497
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.960
And so I worked with George on it.

3498
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.800
We went over like a,

3499
01:23:45.801 --> 01:23:46.361
a lot of it.

3500
01:23:46.361 --> 01:23:46.691
He like,

3501
01:23:46.691 --> 01:23:48.610
he already had a decent one.

3502
01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:48.851
Yeah,

3503
01:23:48.851 --> 01:23:49.600
he just was,

3504
01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.640
he had a couple of rotates over,

3505
01:23:51.641 --> 01:23:54.120
over rotating and a lot of it was the,

3506
01:23:54.121 --> 01:23:57.910
the low knee kicking up as opposed to the higher goal kicking straight.

3507
01:23:57.911 --> 01:23:58.041
Yeah.

3508
01:23:58.041 --> 01:23:58.310
Yeah.

3509
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:59.710
Like that Tuck one knows style.

3510
01:23:59.711 --> 01:24:02.860
You started in that way from the knee backwards.

3511
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.830
Yeah.

3512
01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:06.280
The back kick is higher with us.

3513
01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:09.790
I'll lift it up higher now as far as lifting enough hires where you get the real

3514
01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:12.550
power because they don't involve the hip and a full rotation.

3515
01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:15.520
They're the only the only example Peter Smith,

3516
01:24:15.521 --> 01:24:15.791
you know,

3517
01:24:15.791 --> 01:24:16.970
remember speeding ticket.

3518
01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.330
I as a first time I saw me,

3519
01:24:19.331 --> 01:24:21.820
he was doing a cute machine tournament and um,

3520
01:24:22.150 --> 01:24:25.960
I think he wanted us six fights it and one day oh by spinning back kick.

3521
01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:26.650
And that was,

3522
01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:27.490
that was that cake.

3523
01:24:27.491 --> 01:24:27.691
Hey,

3524
01:24:27.691 --> 01:24:28.600
I need to judge in front of neat.

3525
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:29.570
He had a nasty one,

3526
01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:31.210
but it was so ridiculous.

3527
01:24:31.211 --> 01:24:31.600
Heart.

3528
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.680
It was like when the guy would crumple and it was the craziest thing ever.

3529
01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:36.851
What a guy too,

3530
01:24:36.851 --> 01:24:37.121
man.

3531
01:24:37.121 --> 01:24:37.954
He's uh,

3532
01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:42.360
he's up there now with the Roman for sure because those guys,

3533
01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.690
they knew each other as well.

3534
01:24:44.050 --> 01:24:44.730
Peter Smith.

3535
01:24:44.730 --> 01:24:45.050
Yeah,

3536
01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:45.241
yeah,

3537
01:24:45.241 --> 01:24:45.670
yeah.

3538
01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:46.700
A lot of great personnel.

3539
01:24:46.701 --> 01:24:47.340
So man.

3540
01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:47.591
Yeah,

3541
01:24:47.591 --> 01:24:48.700
he fought a funny guy,

3542
01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:50.093
man.

3543
01:24:50.170 --> 01:24:51.290
I mean he fought,

3544
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:53.770
he fought a lot of tod guys too,

3545
01:24:53.771 --> 01:24:54.011
right?

3546
01:24:54.011 --> 01:24:54.844
Yeah.

3547
01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:55.990
It's hilarious.

3548
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:57.030
Yeah,

3549
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:59.020
guys that will mix up.

3550
01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:00.040
Like I always loved it.

3551
01:25:00.041 --> 01:25:01.300
And the guy was a mix up,

3552
01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:01.900
uh,

3553
01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:05.380
karate techniques and taekwondo techniques with the Moitai like,

3554
01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:06.490
like Andy Hook.

3555
01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:06.990
I mean,

3556
01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:07.511
you throw that,

3557
01:25:07.511 --> 01:25:08.820
we'll kick to the thigh,

3558
01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:09.700
you know,

3559
01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:11.620
that's how we won the whole thing with Bernardo.

3560
01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:15.640
Bernardo got his legs messed up already with Peter Earths and everybody,

3561
01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:16.181
you know,

3562
01:25:16.181 --> 01:25:17.470
and then he smart.

3563
01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.400
It was a smart guy.

3564
01:25:18.401 --> 01:25:19.810
Andy Hook who did that.

3565
01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.510
Nobody ever did that and he did.

3566
01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.680
Then he knocked him out like that to their legs.

3567
01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:24.011
Yeah,

3568
01:25:24.011 --> 01:25:24.844
it's amazing.

3569
01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:27.730
It's an amazing technique that we'll kick to the leg.

3570
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:29.260
There's so much power to it.

3571
01:25:29.261 --> 01:25:29.651
You know it,

3572
01:25:29.651 --> 01:25:29.900
man.

3573
01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:31.660
It's like those couple era guys today.

3574
01:25:31.661 --> 01:25:36.040
I had a question on Facebook or if a pure couple where a guy against the pure

3575
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:38.440
Thai boxer who was going to win and then I go,

3576
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:38.951
but okay,

3577
01:25:38.951 --> 01:25:39.411
well I'll,

3578
01:25:39.411 --> 01:25:40.780
I'll take the pure Thai boxer.

3579
01:25:40.781 --> 01:25:41.441
I say holidays.

3580
01:25:41.441 --> 01:25:43.390
I don't mean like a then Tyler,

3581
01:25:43.391 --> 01:25:44.770
but I say the Thai book show of course,

3582
01:25:44.771 --> 01:25:46.960
because they will probably close to this and it's really fast.

3583
01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:50.320
It had been in hand range and couple of era doesn't have that,

3584
01:25:50.370 --> 01:25:50.641
you know,

3585
01:25:50.641 --> 01:25:52.540
and they have only kicks in and he's spinning.

3586
01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:54.880
But once a cake hits,

3587
01:25:54.881 --> 01:25:55.930
I mean they will.

3588
01:25:56.210 --> 01:25:59.500
I mean they have so much power when they propel that way,

3589
01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:01.990
the way they throw that cake but landing it,

3590
01:26:01.991 --> 01:26:02.824
that's the thing,

3591
01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:03.421
you know,

3592
01:26:03.421 --> 01:26:04.140
and there's a lot

3593
01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:04.771
<v 0>of movement.</v>

3594
01:26:04.771 --> 01:26:06.510
A lot of movement is easy detectable.

3595
01:26:06.810 --> 01:26:09.810
It's like when Leo Machida in that front kick on Randy,

3596
01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.060
that jumping front kick to the

3597
01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:13.560
more crazy,

3598
01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:17.940
the reason he could do it is because he's got good wrestling.

3599
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.490
He's got a black belt in Jujitsu is your good hands.

3600
01:26:20.491 --> 01:26:21.990
He's got to all the other things as well.

3601
01:26:22.230 --> 01:26:26.010
And so then you can add those karate techniques and then they become incredibly

3602
01:26:26.011 --> 01:26:26.500
deadly.

3603
01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:27.333
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

3604
01:26:27.610 --> 01:26:31.330
Talking about a Machita asked may be good to mention because one time I said,

3605
01:26:31.331 --> 01:26:31.451
yeah,

3606
01:26:31.451 --> 01:26:32.590
he doesn't have a lot of weapons.

3607
01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:33.790
I didn't mean it like that.

3608
01:26:33.791 --> 01:26:33.941
What?

3609
01:26:33.941 --> 01:26:34.301
I mean,

3610
01:26:34.301 --> 01:26:37.000
they said he doesn't use a lot of weapons.

3611
01:26:37.001 --> 01:26:37.761
He's got the faith,

3612
01:26:37.761 --> 01:26:40.480
very southpaw stance in one light karate stance,

3613
01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.370
which shuts them down for the right.

3614
01:26:42.610 --> 01:26:43.930
Like he has a sidekick,

3615
01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:46.930
but at the roundhouse kick you don't need to be worried about because he can't

3616
01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.410
use his power in there.

3617
01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:49.930
And I'm not saying people go like,

3618
01:26:49.931 --> 01:26:50.401
oh sure,

3619
01:26:50.401 --> 01:26:51.040
we can knock you out.

3620
01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.710
I'm not saying that we saw Kimbo getting knocked out with the weirdest little

3621
01:26:53.711 --> 01:26:54.430
tiny points.

3622
01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:56.860
Everybody could get knocked out when you hit them at the wrong time.

3623
01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:59.050
The wrong spot for him.

3624
01:26:59.190 --> 01:27:00.300
And you had to write down my spot.

3625
01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.000
But he says his,

3626
01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:02.830
his attacks,

3627
01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:03.431
emotional time,

3628
01:27:03.431 --> 01:27:05.950
it's the left straight or it's a left kick left straight.

3629
01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:06.250
Right.

3630
01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:07.510
Or a left kick left straight.

3631
01:27:07.511 --> 01:27:08.320
Right Hook.

3632
01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.430
And when he moves backwards,

3633
01:27:09.431 --> 01:27:14.431
I said he always moves to that site and if you bull rush him because of his

3634
01:27:14.711 --> 01:27:15.460
stance,

3635
01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:19.780
he has to start walking backwards because otherwise he can't move backwards fast

3636
01:27:19.781 --> 01:27:20.410
enough.

3637
01:27:20.410 --> 01:27:21.420
And that's what I meant to,

3638
01:27:21.421 --> 01:27:21.701
you know.

3639
01:27:21.701 --> 01:27:23.920
But he always like that with a front kick.

3640
01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:25.060
He brings something,

3641
01:27:25.061 --> 01:27:25.361
you know,

3642
01:27:25.361 --> 01:27:26.740
he has those same attacks,

3643
01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.660
but he knows him very well.

3644
01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:31.930
He's got really precision accuracy.

3645
01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:33.340
And then on top of that,

3646
01:27:33.341 --> 01:27:33.490
his,

3647
01:27:33.490 --> 01:27:35.170
his counters are bizarre,

3648
01:27:35.171 --> 01:27:37.790
but he's a tech is pretty much those attacks.

3649
01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:41.000
<v 0>Machida gets a lot of heat and you got a lot of heat in the Dan Henderson fight.</v>

3650
01:27:41.001 --> 01:27:41.211
You know,

3651
01:27:41.211 --> 01:27:43.040
I thought when I was interviewing him after the fight,

3652
01:27:43.041 --> 01:27:44.370
the whole audience was booing him.

3653
01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:47.690
And I thought that was kind of fucked up because I thought first of all,

3654
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:50.120
Dan Henderson is incredibly dangerous,

3655
01:27:50.150 --> 01:27:50.541
very,

3656
01:27:50.541 --> 01:27:50.931
very,

3657
01:27:50.931 --> 01:27:52.170
very dangerous guys.

3658
01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:53.600
Super Powerful puncher,

3659
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:54.441
ruthless,

3660
01:27:54.441 --> 01:27:58.130
very aggressive and lots of experience knocking people out,

3661
01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.260
data centers and knocked out,

3662
01:28:00.261 --> 01:28:01.490
fade or knocked out.

3663
01:28:01.491 --> 01:28:02.510
Vandelay not,

3664
01:28:02.511 --> 01:28:02.691
I mean,

3665
01:28:02.691 --> 01:28:04.730
who knows how to put knuckles to chin,

3666
01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.130
you know,

3667
01:28:05.130 --> 01:28:05.411
he's,

3668
01:28:05.411 --> 01:28:05.691
he's a,

3669
01:28:05.691 --> 01:28:06.670
he's a spooky God.

3670
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:10.550
And there's only one way to fight him and not get knocked out.

3671
01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:11.390
Don't get hit by him.

3672
01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:11.680
Yes.

3673
01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:15.740
And so Machida's number one will don't get hit by that fucking nuclear weapon.

3674
01:28:15.741 --> 01:28:16.880
This guys packing.

3675
01:28:17.210 --> 01:28:19.100
And I thought that was an exciting fight.

3676
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.990
<v 5>It wasn't exciting for,</v>

3677
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:20.261
but I,

3678
01:28:20.261 --> 01:28:21.330
I can understand that people,

3679
01:28:21.331 --> 01:28:22.330
because he's a counterfeiter,

3680
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:24.150
he waits for Henderson Henderson though.

3681
01:28:24.450 --> 01:28:28.440
I thought right from the get go he throws one punch and he stays there and I go,

3682
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:30.330
he's going to get knocked out now because,

3683
01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:32.790
but she is very good at countering.

3684
01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.980
I thought if I would fight,

3685
01:28:35.010 --> 01:28:36.870
if I was Henderson with this wrestling,

3686
01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:38.640
I would just run on him,

3687
01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:39.451
run,

3688
01:28:39.451 --> 01:28:40.171
put them up against,

3689
01:28:40.171 --> 01:28:42.890
he knows he's got to go that way because he doesn't find 95%.

3690
01:28:42.891 --> 01:28:43.770
You Watch the day before,

3691
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:45.780
take him down and go for ground and pound.

3692
01:28:45.781 --> 01:28:46.800
But whatever you do,

3693
01:28:46.801 --> 01:28:51.060
don't throw single punches or two punch combinations because he's so good at the

3694
01:28:51.061 --> 01:28:51.580
counter.

3695
01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:51.970
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

3696
01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:54.490
I think when I see a lot of older wrestlers,

3697
01:28:54.491 --> 01:28:55.540
like a Dan,

3698
01:28:55.570 --> 01:28:56.171
I mean I,

3699
01:28:56.171 --> 01:28:57.004
I know Dan,

3700
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.311
uh,

3701
01:28:57.311 --> 01:29:01.380
recently had a knee injury and his knee was really wrapped up for that fight.

3702
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:04.170
I always assume that they're going in,

3703
01:29:04.171 --> 01:29:05.400
they're banged up.

3704
01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:05.790
Yup.

3705
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:06.750
Always assume.

3706
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:07.663
Extend Sandra Hubba.

3707
01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:08.011
Yeah.

3708
01:29:08.011 --> 01:29:12.040
And I think with Dan especially because he's got so much knockout power,

3709
01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.250
it probably avoid the grappling.

3710
01:29:14.251 --> 01:29:15.690
I mean in bed he's got back issues.

3711
01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:16.190
Yeah.

3712
01:29:16.190 --> 01:29:18.150
I mean I'm sure he does these guys.

3713
01:29:18.151 --> 01:29:20.970
I mean it's fucking brutal way to make a living.

3714
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:22.520
And the 42 now,

3715
01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:23.070
I think he's 14

3716
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:24.120
<v 4>he's demands meant though.</v>

3717
01:29:24.121 --> 01:29:24.990
I really liked that.

3718
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.651
Then it's the,

3719
01:29:25.651 --> 01:29:26.071
you know,

3720
01:29:26.071 --> 01:29:29.490
the weight when he fought a fade or you know,

3721
01:29:29.491 --> 01:29:30.211
that's fatal,

3722
01:29:30.211 --> 01:29:33.060
came out banging and then you see him making up his mind like,

3723
01:29:33.090 --> 01:29:33.271
oh,

3724
01:29:33.271 --> 01:29:34.470
is it going to be like that?

3725
01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:34.950
Yeah.

3726
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:35.783
Okay,

3727
01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.080
I can do that too.

3728
01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.180
And then he freaking came,

3729
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.871
you know,

3730
01:29:39.871 --> 01:29:41.580
and that's what I love about that man.

3731
01:29:41.581 --> 01:29:41.851
He said,

3732
01:29:41.851 --> 01:29:42.451
I saw him,

3733
01:29:42.451 --> 01:29:47.451
it prides like after the first rock crawling on his knees back to the corner and

3734
01:29:47.671 --> 01:29:48.670
then he would come out and say,

3735
01:29:48.671 --> 01:29:48.940
come on,

3736
01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:51.090
like nothing happened and just fight again.

3737
01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:52.170
<v 0>He's a tough motherfucker.</v>

3738
01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:54.200
He took that first Vandelay fight.

3739
01:29:54.201 --> 01:29:55.260
He was not in good shape.

3740
01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:58.530
You could tell he just wasn't in conditioning enough for that fight.

3741
01:29:58.531 --> 01:30:01.680
And that was a scary fight for him at one point in time when the family was

3742
01:30:01.681 --> 01:30:03.210
mounting them and pounding on him,

3743
01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:05.450
beating everybody have ventilators at time.

3744
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:06.643
Yeah.

3745
01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:07.980
Angela was a spooky,

3746
01:30:07.981 --> 01:30:09.270
spooky dude back then.

3747
01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.193
And you know,

3748
01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:13.860
and also this is in pride where there's no drug testing.

3749
01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:14.281
Yup.

3750
01:30:14.281 --> 01:30:16.440
So you mean you could be on Epo,

3751
01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.940
testosterone,

3752
01:30:17.941 --> 01:30:18.541
you name it.

3753
01:30:18.541 --> 01:30:18.781
I mean,

3754
01:30:18.781 --> 01:30:19.614
it was just,

3755
01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:23.100
everybody knows that it's the dirty little thing that nobody wants to talk

3756
01:30:23.101 --> 01:30:23.900
about.

3757
01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:25.150
Those mother fuckers are juicy

3758
01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:26.213
<v 4>gills.</v>

3759
01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:27.330
It's,

3760
01:30:27.330 --> 01:30:27.711
you know,

3761
01:30:27.711 --> 01:30:28.110
you'll,

3762
01:30:28.110 --> 01:30:28.711
I always say,

3763
01:30:28.711 --> 01:30:30.650
just look at the bodies and then look at their bodies,

3764
01:30:30.651 --> 01:30:32.320
how they changed it the most of the time.

3765
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.930
There you have the answer,

3766
01:30:33.931 --> 01:30:34.231
you know.

3767
01:30:34.231 --> 01:30:36.630
And on top of that they didn't get tired.

3768
01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:37.300
Yeah.

3769
01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:38.220
I didn't get tired.

3770
01:30:38.221 --> 01:30:40.200
It was the craziest thing ever.

3771
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.860
Yeah.

3772
01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:42.600
Vandelay in his prime back then,

3773
01:30:42.601 --> 01:30:42.871
man.

3774
01:30:42.871 --> 01:30:44.340
He was so fucking scary.

3775
01:30:44.370 --> 01:30:44.731
Oh cool.

3776
01:30:44.731 --> 01:30:47.010
Was it to see back in Japan that fight?

3777
01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:47.830
Who's amazing?

3778
01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:48.130
Wow.

3779
01:30:48.130 --> 01:30:51.090
And I'm beat Brian Stann classic Vandelay.

3780
01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.950
<v 0>You know what I liked about that fight too?</v>

3781
01:30:52.951 --> 01:30:54.990
He didn't cut down to one 85 yup.

3782
01:30:55.210 --> 01:30:56.860
<v 4>I think that that's no good for him.</v>

3783
01:30:56.890 --> 01:30:57.060
Pick.

3784
01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:57.641
It hurts him.

3785
01:30:57.641 --> 01:30:58.750
I tell everybody,

3786
01:30:58.780 --> 01:30:59.410
you know,

3787
01:30:59.410 --> 01:31:00.670
this is the thing with fighters,

3788
01:31:00.810 --> 01:31:01.930
a budge of fighters.

3789
01:31:02.110 --> 01:31:04.090
When they lose in the certain way class,

3790
01:31:04.330 --> 01:31:08.200
they blame it on the outer person cutting more weight than them.

3791
01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:08.941
That's why they were starting.

3792
01:31:08.941 --> 01:31:09.161
I said,

3793
01:31:09.161 --> 01:31:09.341
dude,

3794
01:31:09.341 --> 01:31:10.240
make up a technique,

3795
01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:10.901
you know,

3796
01:31:10.901 --> 01:31:13.330
get more stamina and more technique and work harder.

3797
01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:13.811
You know?

3798
01:31:13.811 --> 01:31:14.561
That's what I would do.

3799
01:31:14.561 --> 01:31:16.070
I always find heavyweight also.

3800
01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.220
I could easily fight under two and a punch.

3801
01:31:18.221 --> 01:31:19.270
I was under 200 pounds,

3802
01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:21.490
but I didn't want to do it because I saw all these guys,

3803
01:31:21.491 --> 01:31:23.320
all my friends getting sick.

3804
01:31:23.321 --> 01:31:25.200
I mean they were all shrunk.

3805
01:31:25.201 --> 01:31:27.580
God before the five that him stressed out.

3806
01:31:27.581 --> 01:31:27.810
You know,

3807
01:31:27.810 --> 01:31:29.620
I say keep the body happy man.

3808
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:30.591
You knew your,

3809
01:31:30.591 --> 01:31:33.460
you're beating it up everyday already two times a day.

3810
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:35.220
The only thing I could do for it,

3811
01:31:35.221 --> 01:31:38.080
there's give her what it wants and I'll give him all the fluids,

3812
01:31:38.110 --> 01:31:38.890
nutrients,

3813
01:31:38.890 --> 01:31:39.531
give it to them and,

3814
01:31:39.531 --> 01:31:39.651
and,

3815
01:31:39.651 --> 01:31:41.800
and don't pull that out is the worst thing you can do.

3816
01:31:41.890 --> 01:31:44.500
<v 0>People don't understand what we're talking about if you're not into MMA,</v>

3817
01:31:44.501 --> 01:31:48.040
but there's a real issue in mixed martial arts with weight cutting.

3818
01:31:48.041 --> 01:31:52.390
And what that means is we'll guys will way say if you had to get down to 170

3819
01:31:52.391 --> 01:31:52.780
pounds,

3820
01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:53.591
there's guys that way,

3821
01:31:53.591 --> 01:31:56.830
like Anthony Rumble Johnson well over 200 pounds,

3822
01:31:57.130 --> 01:31:58.210
well over 200 pounds.

3823
01:31:58.211 --> 01:31:59.000
He's enormous.

3824
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:03.860
He's fighting heavyweight now Anthony Rumble Johnson and I think of March 23rd

3825
01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:07.040
he's fighting our Lawsky and heavyweight.

3826
01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:13.690
He used to cut down to one 70 and what that means is you essentially starve

3827
01:32:13.701 --> 01:32:18.110
yourself and then dehydrate yourself and dehydrate yourself the day before the

3828
01:32:18.111 --> 01:32:18.381
fight,

3829
01:32:18.381 --> 01:32:20.300
to the point where guys would black out,

3830
01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:21.410
guys would lose their,

3831
01:32:21.411 --> 01:32:23.090
they could move their legs,

3832
01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:26.720
like literally their legs would stop working or they would have to fight in a

3833
01:32:26.721 --> 01:32:27.261
cage fight.

3834
01:32:27.261 --> 01:32:27.870
The next day

3835
01:32:27.870 --> 01:32:29.760
<v 4>we had to pull her to ski to the Sada.</v>

3836
01:32:29.761 --> 01:32:30.130
You know,

3837
01:32:30.130 --> 01:32:30.963
you'll pass out.

3838
01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:35.870
He lost a one 27 pounds in a day and the end today,

3839
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:36.451
the guide,

3840
01:32:36.451 --> 01:32:37.061
the,

3841
01:32:37.061 --> 01:32:37.560
the,

3842
01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:40.730
he's a young kid letting commissioner said that it was the biggest difference

3843
01:32:40.731 --> 01:32:42.090
you've Edis ever saw.

3844
01:32:42.210 --> 01:32:47.210
That's almost two weight classes up that he was 27 or 28 even pounds heavier the

3845
01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:48.230
next day.

3846
01:32:48.230 --> 01:32:49.063
<v 0>Didn't hoard,</v>

3847
01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:49.490
hoard.

3848
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:51.200
Dusky was like 18 at the time.

3849
01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:51.591
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

3850
01:32:51.591 --> 01:32:52.490
I was very young.

3851
01:32:52.491 --> 01:32:52.731
Yeah,

3852
01:32:52.731 --> 01:32:53.091
I think,

3853
01:32:53.091 --> 01:32:53.360
yeah,

3854
01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.400
1819 bucks when he started fighting it,

3855
01:32:55.401 --> 01:32:56.180
the IFL.

3856
01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:56.900
So,

3857
01:32:56.900 --> 01:33:01.900
and I remember the first time because he fought the guy from Hanzo and I go,

3858
01:33:01.911 --> 01:33:02.451
oh my God,

3859
01:33:02.451 --> 01:33:03.500
because it's a baby,

3860
01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:04.041
you know,

3861
01:33:04.041 --> 01:33:04.874
you look at me

3862
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:08.041
and a,

3863
01:33:08.041 --> 01:33:09.110
and Shaun goes,

3864
01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.310
don't you worry about it,

3865
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:11.151
you watch.

3866
01:33:11.151 --> 01:33:14.990
And that he started man went to town and he became a fan favorite right away.

3867
01:33:15.230 --> 01:33:15.680
Yeah.

3868
01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:16.310
<v 0>He uh,</v>

3869
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:18.770
he looked like he had a little bit of body fat on them though.

3870
01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:18.970
I mean,

3871
01:33:18.970 --> 01:33:19.220
yeah,

3872
01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:19.791
at the time.

3873
01:33:19.791 --> 01:33:20.060
Yeah.

3874
01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:22.160
He could have like lost the weight correctly.

3875
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.991
Yeah,

3876
01:33:23.991 --> 01:33:24.750
that's true.

3877
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:26.300
They're longer weight cutting,

3878
01:33:26.301 --> 01:33:26.601
man.

3879
01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:27.434
It's just so,

3880
01:33:28.130 --> 01:33:28.881
but then again,

3881
01:33:28.881 --> 01:33:31.370
some guys not to do it well like look at Benson Henderson.

3882
01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:31.970
Yeah.

3883
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:32.750
He does a great,

3884
01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:33.860
he doesn't look sucked in.

3885
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:35.210
He is obviously very,

3886
01:33:35.211 --> 01:33:36.044
very lean.

3887
01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:36.260
Yeah.

3888
01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:37.430
He's disciplined about it.

3889
01:33:37.431 --> 01:33:38.600
And because of that,

3890
01:33:38.601 --> 01:33:39.434
when he fights,

3891
01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:41.030
he's got all the stamina in the world.

3892
01:33:41.031 --> 01:33:41.661
He can do five,

3893
01:33:41.661 --> 01:33:42.440
five minute rounds,

3894
01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:43.280
no problem.

3895
01:33:43.370 --> 01:33:44.180
And you know,

3896
01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:45.013
he's huge.

3897
01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:46.000
He's huge for one.

3898
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:46.781
<v 4>Some guys don't,</v>

3899
01:33:46.781 --> 01:33:46.911
they,

3900
01:33:46.911 --> 01:33:47.591
they used it,

3901
01:33:47.591 --> 01:33:49.030
they drink two gallons of water a day.

3902
01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:49.330
You know,

3903
01:33:49.330 --> 01:33:50.650
that's a lot of pilots right there.

3904
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:52.480
And if you only have to cut that out,

3905
01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:53.261
then it's easy.

3906
01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:56.710
But I think once you start cutting before and you start eating away muscle,

3907
01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.420
you know that you're doing it wrong.

3908
01:33:58.421 --> 01:34:02.390
And once the reserves are going to be asked for in the body and they're gonna

3909
01:34:02.410 --> 01:34:02.621
say,

3910
01:34:02.621 --> 01:34:02.921
okay,

3911
01:34:02.921 --> 01:34:03.181
I,

3912
01:34:03.181 --> 01:34:04.900
I truly believe like the brain fluid she got,

3913
01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:06.460
God knows why you're taking them away.

3914
01:34:06.461 --> 01:34:07.061
They're also,

3915
01:34:07.061 --> 01:34:07.301
you know,

3916
01:34:07.301 --> 01:34:10.480
and that is the reason to the brain is balancing upside down.

3917
01:34:10.481 --> 01:34:12.040
And that's why people get to,

3918
01:34:12.041 --> 01:34:12.874
you know,

3919
01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:13.813
uh,

3920
01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:16.680
<v 0>brain damage and people don't know this.</v>

3921
01:34:16.681 --> 01:34:18.150
But in boxing,

3922
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:21.510
I believe all of the deaths ever recorded.

3923
01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:24.900
We're below the heavyweight division because the heavyweights,

3924
01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:25.320
I mean,

3925
01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:26.820
there might be some,

3926
01:34:26.850 --> 01:34:27.330
you know,

3927
01:34:27.330 --> 01:34:30.090
some rare occurrences boxing's a tough game.

3928
01:34:30.150 --> 01:34:31.680
Some people might have died as a heavy heavyweight,

3929
01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:35.520
but most of the incidents is we're in the lighter weight classes when guys cut a

3930
01:34:35.521 --> 01:34:36.354
lot of weight.

3931
01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:39.030
And that was when they used to have the way in the day of the fight.

3932
01:34:39.450 --> 01:34:41.880
And that was also when they weren't using ivs.

3933
01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:44.190
But a lot of folks don't know is when you see these guys,

3934
01:34:44.191 --> 01:34:45.240
they dehydrate themselves.

3935
01:34:45.241 --> 01:34:48.690
One of the things that's sick about it is they go and they get fucking ivy bags

3936
01:34:48.691 --> 01:34:49.240
stuck in there.

3937
01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:52.560
I get a needle in their arm and they replenish their fluids that right?

3938
01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:52.971
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3939
01:34:52.971 --> 01:34:54.950
I would walk in a room and the whole room,

3940
01:34:54.951 --> 01:34:58.220
everybody would sit there and there's hanging everywhere,

3941
01:34:58.600 --> 01:34:58.901
<v 2>you know,</v>

3942
01:34:58.901 --> 01:34:59.990
and they get retained.

3943
01:35:00.170 --> 01:35:01.340
How about fucking blood?

3944
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:02.870
I know a guy who uh,

3945
01:35:02.871 --> 01:35:07.580
went into a room or one of the fighters is way back in the day and the guy had

3946
01:35:07.581 --> 01:35:10.580
fucking pints of blood out that they were putting back in.

3947
01:35:10.581 --> 01:35:12.980
But you see if that's blood coming out of the fridge,

3948
01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.590
that's like EPO white blood cells.

3949
01:35:15.591 --> 01:35:15.801
Yeah,

3950
01:35:15.801 --> 01:35:16.160
yeah,

3951
01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:16.800
exactly.

3952
01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:17.011
Yeah.

3953
01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:18.750
And he was also doing it to,

3954
01:35:18.751 --> 01:35:19.584
to make weight.

3955
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:23.210
They were taking blood out of them to make weight and adding extra blood in

3956
01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:27.730
idiot Smith like that EPO shits what they're doing right now.

3957
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:28.490
Also,

3958
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:30.950
you know this like your blood gets really thick,

3959
01:35:30.951 --> 01:35:32.510
your heart rate gets really low.

3960
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:33.170
You have to,

3961
01:35:33.170 --> 01:35:35.360
some of these guys have to wake up in the middle of the night,

3962
01:35:35.361 --> 01:35:37.490
jumped 10 minutes on a bike or,

3963
01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:37.941
or you know,

3964
01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:38.060
in,

3965
01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:41.480
in the home to have it end up in the bedroom because otherwise the heart stopped

3966
01:35:41.630 --> 01:35:42.463
beating and I go,

3967
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:45.080
do you really want to get a title like that?

3968
01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:47.810
Plus when you get your title and you cheated,

3969
01:35:47.811 --> 01:35:51.110
what if you use steroids or anything and you get a title?

3970
01:35:51.111 --> 01:35:51.591
How can you,

3971
01:35:51.591 --> 01:35:52.520
I was still these people.

3972
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:53.930
If I brushed my teeth,

3973
01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.220
I can look at myself in the mirror.

3974
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:56.600
I did everything without cheating.

3975
01:35:56.601 --> 01:36:01.130
Nothing ever in my body other than just good food in your teeth.

3976
01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:04.250
When you brush your teeth and you look at yourself in the mirror,

3977
01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:05.390
you're going to go like,

3978
01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:06.380
and he was a cheater.

3979
01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:06.980
I was like,

3980
01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:10.220
how competitive are you a toothbrush taking steroids to brush your teeth?

3981
01:36:10.670 --> 01:36:11.503
Oh Hey,

3982
01:36:11.650 --> 01:36:12.200
you know what?

3983
01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.310
You're going to laugh.

3984
01:36:13.311 --> 01:36:15.890
You got to my wife's lesser ass off every time she,

3985
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:17.960
because my little daughter is the same as me,

3986
01:36:17.961 --> 01:36:18.290
like,

3987
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:19.760
like movement wise,

3988
01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.140
she bounces all day long.

3989
01:36:21.141 --> 01:36:21.351
Ding,

3990
01:36:21.351 --> 01:36:21.561
Ding,

3991
01:36:21.561 --> 01:36:21.741
Ding.

3992
01:36:21.741 --> 01:36:24.680
You know and dancing 11 o'clock at night and when you hear a brushing her teeth

3993
01:36:24.681 --> 01:36:26.980
because she says the same as me,

3994
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:29.690
it's a lot of power to have the same things and aware of her.

3995
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:31.281
It's Hilarious,

3996
01:36:31.281 --> 01:36:31.491
you know.

3997
01:36:31.491 --> 01:36:34.850
And the other one says it's so cool when you see one room for my daughter it's,

3998
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:40.220
it's a garbage field and the other one is like everything is perfect.

3999
01:36:40.221 --> 01:36:43.670
Like the codepen is perfectly on the faith.

4000
01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:46.490
That's funny how their personality is the best.

4001
01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:49.160
I have one my two year old that I think might be a lesbian,

4002
01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:51.800
I don't have any problem with that,

4003
01:36:51.801 --> 01:36:52.700
but my wife does.

4004
01:36:52.701 --> 01:36:53.750
When I say she's a dyke,

4005
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:57.740
she goes and she goes and picks up like she goes and goes,

4006
01:36:57.741 --> 01:37:00.440
grabs like Batman and Spiderman.

4007
01:37:00.441 --> 01:37:01.730
She always wants to play with the hawk.

4008
01:37:01.850 --> 01:37:03.050
She wants to play with boys toys.

4009
01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:04.130
She likes it.

4010
01:37:04.130 --> 01:37:05.570
Maybe she likes boys very much.

4011
01:37:05.571 --> 01:37:06.470
So it be also,

4012
01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.470
she sees me work out.

4013
01:37:07.471 --> 01:37:08.271
So she comes over,

4014
01:37:08.271 --> 01:37:09.770
she tries punching and kicking the bag.

4015
01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:11.000
She's very aggressive.

4016
01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.030
Oh it's the best.

4017
01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:12.561
She's,

4018
01:37:12.561 --> 01:37:15.880
but the other ones like girly and Princessy said he's built different too.

4019
01:37:15.881 --> 01:37:17.300
She has like thick ankles and shit.

4020
01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:18.350
Probably a dike.

4021
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:19.850
You got to see what I have.

4022
01:37:19.851 --> 01:37:20.001
No,

4023
01:37:20.001 --> 01:37:21.020
I love lesbians,

4024
01:37:21.021 --> 01:37:21.854
man.

4025
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:22.910
You know my wife's like,

4026
01:37:22.911 --> 01:37:23.900
don't say that.

4027
01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:24.471
And I'm like,

4028
01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:25.630
how can you can?

4029
01:37:25.890 --> 01:37:26.090
Yeah.

4030
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:26.970
Not only that,

4031
01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:28.280
but my wife has gay friends.

4032
01:37:28.281 --> 01:37:29.390
She loves gay people.

4033
01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.313
You know?

4034
01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:34.490
I think you're the people with the left brain capacity.

4035
01:37:34.491 --> 01:37:35.630
They have all problems with it.

4036
01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:39.470
I truly believe you know the Trans Gender who's fighting?

4037
01:37:39.471 --> 01:37:40.730
And they asked me your last week,

4038
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.271
I said,

4039
01:37:41.271 --> 01:37:41.600
who?

4040
01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:42.610
Who even cares?

4041
01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:43.453
I care.

4042
01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.670
They need to fight transgenders.

4043
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:49.090
If a transgender is going to find the need to find out what you think.

4044
01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:49.520
So yeah.

4045
01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:50.210
Fuck yeah.

4046
01:37:50.210 --> 01:37:51.860
Why you think he's going to get her horny?

4047
01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:53.330
Oh,

4048
01:37:53.410 --> 01:37:53.601
no,

4049
01:37:53.601 --> 01:37:53.771
no,

4050
01:37:53.771 --> 01:37:53.931
no,

4051
01:37:53.931 --> 01:37:54.111
no,

4052
01:37:54.111 --> 01:37:54.321
no.

4053
01:37:54.321 --> 01:37:55.090
Physical.

4054
01:37:55.090 --> 01:37:56.050
Have an advantage

4055
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:58.210
<v 0>for the mechanical advantage of the male body.</v>

4056
01:37:58.630 --> 01:37:59.463
<v 5>Oh,</v>

4057
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.100
let's show he fights.

4058
01:38:01.101 --> 01:38:01.851
Gail kills.

4059
01:38:01.851 --> 01:38:02.361
Yeah.

4060
01:38:02.361 --> 01:38:03.020
No,

4061
01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:03.351
I didn't.

4062
01:38:03.351 --> 01:38:04.184
I didn't know that.

4063
01:38:04.190 --> 01:38:04.360
No,

4064
01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:04.471
no,

4065
01:38:04.471 --> 01:38:04.531
no,

4066
01:38:04.531 --> 01:38:04.700
no.

4067
01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:05.930
I thought he fought guys.

4068
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:06.770
Oh,

4069
01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:06.941
no,

4070
01:38:06.941 --> 01:38:07.091
no,

4071
01:38:07.091 --> 01:38:07.301
no,

4072
01:38:07.301 --> 01:38:07.470
no.

4073
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:07.970
Dad.

4074
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:08.140
No,

4075
01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:08.760
no.

4076
01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:09.330
Yeah,

4077
01:38:09.330 --> 01:38:09.681
of course.

4078
01:38:09.681 --> 01:38:10.670
He's got testosterone.

4079
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:13.280
<v 0>Me Mobby International Olympic Committee.</v>

4080
01:38:13.281 --> 01:38:15.200
If you've been a transgender,

4081
01:38:15.201 --> 01:38:17.690
if you've cut off within two years,

4082
01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.280
I think two year after two years,

4083
01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:22.930
they allow you to compete against women until they see.

4084
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:23.823
I didn't know that.

4085
01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:24.171
Yeah,

4086
01:38:24.171 --> 01:38:25.110
I think it's ridiculous.

4087
01:38:25.130 --> 01:38:25.450
No,

4088
01:38:25.450 --> 01:38:26.840
I thought just fighting with guys.

4089
01:38:26.841 --> 01:38:27.051
Is it?

4090
01:38:27.051 --> 01:38:27.451
Come on.

4091
01:38:27.451 --> 01:38:27.820
No,

4092
01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:28.653
I don't care.

4093
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.430
But the guys,

4094
01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:32.660
they would get killed without the testosterone.

4095
01:38:32.661 --> 01:38:33.231
They'd get killed.

4096
01:38:33.231 --> 01:38:35.040
You get your balls cut off and then fight against guys,

4097
01:38:35.041 --> 01:38:35.780
you're going to get killed.

4098
01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:38.160
There's a famous Muay Thai fighter who was a,

4099
01:38:38.161 --> 01:38:39.630
a lady boy who,

4100
01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:39.921
oh,

4101
01:38:39.921 --> 01:38:40.640
Yay.

4102
01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:41.660
Fought really well.

4103
01:38:41.690 --> 01:38:42.610
Kohler lady boils.

4104
01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:43.160
Yeah.

4105
01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:47.030
And then she got the operation and then she started getting knocked out because

4106
01:38:47.031 --> 01:38:48.170
once she got the operation,

4107
01:38:48.171 --> 01:38:48.891
became a woman.

4108
01:38:48.891 --> 01:38:50.270
She didn't have testosterone anymore.

4109
01:38:50.830 --> 01:38:52.190
She started really getting fucked up.

4110
01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:53.650
But it's still,

4111
01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:53.941
I mean,

4112
01:38:53.941 --> 01:38:57.470
you might not be able to beat men after you get your Dick cut off,

4113
01:38:57.471 --> 01:38:58.550
but you just took a beat.

4114
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.910
Women.

4115
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:59.480
Yep.

4116
01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:00.410
The tendons,

4117
01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:01.280
the ligaments,

4118
01:39:01.281 --> 01:39:02.600
the bone density.

4119
01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:03.800
Especially because she's,

4120
01:39:03.890 --> 01:39:06.470
she's not just like walking around.

4121
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:08.240
She's training for MMA.

4122
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.500
Yeah.

4123
01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.950
So like she has a male body.

4124
01:39:09.951 --> 01:39:11.060
That's his training for MMA.

4125
01:39:11.210 --> 01:39:12.800
And I looked at her and she's so bulky,

4126
01:39:12.801 --> 01:39:13.101
man.

4127
01:39:13.101 --> 01:39:13.341
I'm like,

4128
01:39:13.341 --> 01:39:13.581
man,

4129
01:39:13.581 --> 01:39:16.790
I can't believe that this chick is not taking something which has no balls

4130
01:39:16.791 --> 01:39:17.390
anymore.

4131
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:18.980
How she keeping this much muscle mass?

4132
01:39:18.981 --> 01:39:19.131
I mean,

4133
01:39:19.131 --> 01:39:20.570
she looks like a muscular man.

4134
01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:21.943
It's gross.

4135
01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:23.353
That's that.

4136
01:39:23.370 --> 01:39:24.720
That's that cold though.

4137
01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:27.050
Fight out of guys then that I'm okay with it.

4138
01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:30.710
How'd you feel about that whole sideboard thing when Cyborg tested positive for

4139
01:39:30.711 --> 01:39:31.544
steroids?

4140
01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:32.190
Well,

4141
01:39:32.190 --> 01:39:33.440
you don't know who that is focused.

4142
01:39:33.441 --> 01:39:34.350
So cyborg is a,

4143
01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:37.400
one of the scariest women fighters and she's a real woman,

4144
01:39:37.401 --> 01:39:40.340
but she's very masculine and very muscular.

4145
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:41.061
And she's,

4146
01:39:41.061 --> 01:39:41.330
uh,

4147
01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:42.500
she tested positive.

4148
01:39:42.690 --> 01:39:43.050
<v 5>Well,</v>

4149
01:39:43.050 --> 01:39:43.341
she,

4150
01:39:43.341 --> 01:39:44.370
she says she didn't do it.

4151
01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:45.041
I get it.

4152
01:39:45.041 --> 01:39:46.050
But people will say that,

4153
01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:46.780
but I,

4154
01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:47.250
I,

4155
01:39:47.250 --> 01:39:48.480
nobody was a shock.

4156
01:39:48.481 --> 01:39:48.790
Right.

4157
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:49.830
That by the way,

4158
01:39:49.831 --> 01:39:50.790
she looks,

4159
01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:52.890
she looks indeed that she's doing,

4160
01:39:52.891 --> 01:39:55.980
I mean the way after the fight when she was throwing up her husband at the time

4161
01:39:55.981 --> 01:39:56.461
to divorce,

4162
01:39:56.461 --> 01:39:57.010
now,

4163
01:39:57.010 --> 01:39:57.271
you know,

4164
01:39:57.271 --> 01:39:57.781
it was like,

4165
01:39:57.781 --> 01:39:58.381
Whoa,

4166
01:39:58.381 --> 01:39:59.670
she is a normal,

4167
01:39:59.671 --> 01:40:00.160
strong.

4168
01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:00.993
She was like,

4169
01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:02.521
she was so,

4170
01:40:02.521 --> 01:40:03.510
it was a,

4171
01:40:03.511 --> 01:40:03.811
you know,

4172
01:40:03.811 --> 01:40:04.770
it was not a big surprise,

4173
01:40:04.771 --> 01:40:05.730
but I always say,

4174
01:40:05.731 --> 01:40:05.910
you know,

4175
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:06.720
if you really,

4176
01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.250
if they say no and they say no,

4177
01:40:08.251 --> 01:40:09.084
I gotta you know,

4178
01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:09.550
you,

4179
01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:09.830
you,

4180
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:10.890
you have to believe them.

4181
01:40:10.891 --> 01:40:11.950
I think it's the,

4182
01:40:11.951 --> 01:40:12.121
the,

4183
01:40:12.121 --> 01:40:13.980
it will be very sad.

4184
01:40:13.981 --> 01:40:14.610
But that's me.

4185
01:40:14.610 --> 01:40:15.900
I could not lie like that.

4186
01:40:15.901 --> 01:40:17.370
It could not live in a line like that.

4187
01:40:17.371 --> 01:40:20.490
If I have to lie about that and my whole life is aligned now suddenly.

4188
01:40:20.491 --> 01:40:21.450
So I say,

4189
01:40:21.451 --> 01:40:21.750
okay,

4190
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:22.570
here's the reality.

4191
01:40:22.570 --> 01:40:27.430
<v 0>The reality is she came from a Brazilian camp known for aggressive fighters that</v>

4192
01:40:27.431 --> 01:40:29.830
may or may not have taken substances as well.

4193
01:40:29.831 --> 01:40:30.341
So there's,

4194
01:40:30.341 --> 01:40:31.121
there's that issue,

4195
01:40:31.121 --> 01:40:31.600
right?

4196
01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:34.990
That's that that's legit in escapable and then too,

4197
01:40:35.050 --> 01:40:36.130
she tested positive.

4198
01:40:36.150 --> 01:40:36.370
Yeah.

4199
01:40:36.370 --> 01:40:37.660
And once he tests positive,

4200
01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:41.510
I mean it's essentially why would we believe you any other,

4201
01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:45.370
you look like you're on steroids and you test positive for steroids.

4202
01:40:45.410 --> 01:40:45.760
Yup.

4203
01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:50.230
That is just as much of an issue to me as a transgender woman or a man who used

4204
01:40:50.231 --> 01:40:50.700
to be,

4205
01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:52.500
<v 5>well you mean when you said it,</v>

4206
01:40:52.501 --> 01:40:54.160
but to try and shit you heard

4207
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.300
<v 2>now with the ovary,</v>

4208
01:40:55.301 --> 01:40:55.411
I,

4209
01:40:55.411 --> 01:40:57.040
I read that last week with the injury,

4210
01:40:57.041 --> 01:41:00.130
I heard something on the day of inside of a May they said,

4211
01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:00.371
oh,

4212
01:41:00.371 --> 01:41:01.001
it was an injury.

4213
01:41:01.001 --> 01:41:06.001
I truly believed the reason because his testosterone was Alistair Overeem's

4214
01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:11.460
testosterone level was [inaudible] 79 so I thought that was the reason he was

4215
01:41:12.731 --> 01:41:13.980
not going to fight in,

4216
01:41:14.010 --> 01:41:17.170
in the VA because Keith guys were at set prior usage,

4217
01:41:17.410 --> 01:41:17.711
you know,

4218
01:41:17.711 --> 01:41:18.371
and that's the reason.

4219
01:41:18.371 --> 01:41:19.350
That's why he cannot find it.

4220
01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:21.270
So I'm going to explain everything.

4221
01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:27.940
We were talking about his testosterone use exemption,

4222
01:41:27.970 --> 01:41:28.061
uh,

4223
01:41:28.061 --> 01:41:30.730
Tue for testosterone replacement therapy.

4224
01:41:30.731 --> 01:41:35.731
So very controversial issue now with MMA fighters where there are taking

4225
01:41:35.831 --> 01:41:39.550
testosterone because the body doesn't produce it as much anymore.

4226
01:41:39.551 --> 01:41:40.750
And there's two reasons for that.

4227
01:41:40.751 --> 01:41:41.710
There's three actually.

4228
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:45.790
One is just the natural aging process or natural aging process and once you get

4229
01:41:45.791 --> 01:41:46.421
over 30,

4230
01:41:46.421 --> 01:41:48.430
you body starts producing less and less testosterone.

4231
01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:50.350
I would say 25 maybe.

4232
01:41:50.590 --> 01:41:50.921
Well No,

4233
01:41:50.921 --> 01:41:53.950
it slowly read it to you don't need it.

4234
01:41:53.951 --> 01:41:54.101
No,

4235
01:41:54.101 --> 01:41:54.934
you certainly don't need it.

4236
01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:00.120
But the good true issue though is when guys have taken steroids in the past,

4237
01:42:02.410 --> 01:42:06.100
they take them for prolonged periods of time and then it kills their balls and

4238
01:42:06.101 --> 01:42:08.290
so then they test really low.

4239
01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.960
That's most likely what's going on with Allister.

4240
01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:14.890
And then Keith guys have said if they find out that you prior usage,

4241
01:42:14.891 --> 01:42:16.870
because Ellis to was caught before,

4242
01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.220
this is for listeners at home,

4243
01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:19.061
you know,

4244
01:42:19.061 --> 01:42:20.530
by using testosterone.

4245
01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:21.551
Then they said,

4246
01:42:21.551 --> 01:42:21.791
okay,

4247
01:42:21.791 --> 01:42:22.541
you cannot get it.

4248
01:42:22.541 --> 01:42:24.130
As soon as the fight was in Vegas.

4249
01:42:24.131 --> 01:42:24.431
I thought,

4250
01:42:24.431 --> 01:42:24.551
oh,

4251
01:42:24.551 --> 01:42:25.301
that is the reason.

4252
01:42:25.301 --> 01:42:27.550
But then under day of the show they said,

4253
01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:27.881
oh no,

4254
01:42:27.881 --> 01:42:29.270
he just released it was his hamstring.

4255
01:42:29.290 --> 01:42:30.010
And so,

4256
01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:31.480
so when I sat there story,

4257
01:42:31.481 --> 01:42:31.811
I said,

4258
01:42:31.811 --> 01:42:31.991
well,

4259
01:42:31.991 --> 01:42:35.110
I thought it was that testosterone daily was with people,

4260
01:42:35.111 --> 01:42:35.620
right.

4261
01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:39.070
People right away because I said something about Ellis to like over a year and a

4262
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:39.903
half ago or something to go like,

4263
01:42:39.970 --> 01:42:40.211
oh,

4264
01:42:40.211 --> 01:42:42.940
it's only because he have golden glory and you know,

4265
01:42:42.941 --> 01:42:43.480
all the,

4266
01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:44.081
all that stuff.

4267
01:42:44.081 --> 01:42:44.261
I go,

4268
01:42:44.261 --> 01:42:44.561
dude,

4269
01:42:44.561 --> 01:42:45.170
I grew over,

4270
01:42:45.170 --> 01:42:46.030
you grow over it.

4271
01:42:46.090 --> 01:42:47.560
I don't have a problem with it.

4272
01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:50.320
I'm just saying what I read this week,

4273
01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:50.861
you know,

4274
01:42:50.861 --> 01:42:54.850
and I thought was the reason he couldn't compete in Nevada because Keith geysers

4275
01:42:54.851 --> 01:42:55.460
there,

4276
01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:55.960
um,

4277
01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:58.180
for folks who don't know what the fuck we're talking about,

4278
01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:00.460
testosterone is,

4279
01:43:00.461 --> 01:43:01.180
um,

4280
01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:01.511
the,

4281
01:43:01.511 --> 01:43:02.230
it's all,

4282
01:43:02.230 --> 01:43:02.441
it's,

4283
01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:04.090
it's a huge controversial issue.

4284
01:43:04.091 --> 01:43:08.260
Now Vitor Belfort is another example of it because Keith Kaiser has said that

4285
01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:13.090
because of the fact that he tested positive for steroids in 2006,

4286
01:43:13.091 --> 01:43:13.960
I believe it was.

4287
01:43:14.110 --> 01:43:16.090
I think it was when the pride that was,

4288
01:43:16.091 --> 01:43:16.451
yeah,

4289
01:43:16.451 --> 01:43:16.931
at that time,

4290
01:43:16.931 --> 01:43:17.351
Vegas,

4291
01:43:17.351 --> 01:43:17.880
right.

4292
01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:18.940
Fight against Dan Henderson.

4293
01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:22.000
When you test positive for steroids,

4294
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:23.020
they won't,

4295
01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:23.950
if you have a,

4296
01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:24.401
you know,

4297
01:43:24.401 --> 01:43:26.770
any history of doing that,

4298
01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:30.460
they assumed that the reason why your test is low is cause you ruined your body.

4299
01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:31.390
And if that's the case,

4300
01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:33.100
you're on your own because you cheated.

4301
01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:34.331
If you have a,

4302
01:43:34.331 --> 01:43:38.320
a real medical condition for why your testosterone is low,

4303
01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:42.160
then they'll grant exemptions and they've granted them for Forrest Griffin and a

4304
01:43:42.161 --> 01:43:43.030
bunch of other guys.

4305
01:43:43.090 --> 01:43:43.960
Dan Henderson,

4306
01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:47.020
famous Andy's shift 42 years old or something,

4307
01:43:47.021 --> 01:43:47.291
you know,

4308
01:43:47.291 --> 01:43:49.090
now we started with talking to h here,

4309
01:43:49.330 --> 01:43:49.600
but,

4310
01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:54.600
but a guy who's 30 or under 35 and he should not have low testosterone.

4311
01:43:55.730 --> 01:43:56.031
He shoot,

4312
01:43:56.031 --> 01:43:57.800
not unless he's going to a medical condition.

4313
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:58.250
Yeah.

4314
01:43:58.250 --> 01:43:58.620
You know,

4315
01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:01.700
I had guys that do will look at me in the shed.

4316
01:44:01.701 --> 01:44:02.001
No.

4317
01:44:02.001 --> 01:44:02.990
And I really need it.

4318
01:44:02.991 --> 01:44:03.291
And I go,

4319
01:44:03.291 --> 01:44:03.650
dude,

4320
01:44:03.650 --> 01:44:08.650
I remember you when you were two 25 you'll bagful of Zichy were freaking huge.

4321
01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:12.860
Now you're fighting a one 55 and now you want an exemption because,

4322
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:13.431
oh no,

4323
01:44:13.431 --> 01:44:15.090
I have something with my colon.

4324
01:44:15.091 --> 01:44:15.711
And whatever they say,

4325
01:44:15.711 --> 01:44:16.160
I say,

4326
01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:18.150
you know what the reason is don't be,

4327
01:44:18.210 --> 01:44:19.580
don't be here lying to me now.

4328
01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:19.911
You know,

4329
01:44:19.911 --> 01:44:23.510
and nobody ever wants to admit my boss work cause I took Roy too much.

4330
01:44:23.511 --> 01:44:24.140
Yeah.

4331
01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:28.700
But so like B [inaudible] who's active in the UFC and he's doing really well,

4332
01:44:28.701 --> 01:44:31.880
just knocked out Michael Bisping and how he's going to fight again.

4333
01:44:31.881 --> 01:44:33.170
He's gonna fight in Brazil.

4334
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:34.640
He's got to,

4335
01:44:34.670 --> 01:44:35.060
he's,

4336
01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:36.680
he can never fight in Vegas now.

4337
01:44:36.930 --> 01:44:38.390
That's what I said also in our show.

4338
01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:38.790
I,

4339
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:41.450
I gave the example of Alistair and I and I said,

4340
01:44:41.451 --> 01:44:43.960
because he said to the same thing with Frito Belfort and of course they attacked

4341
01:44:43.961 --> 01:44:46.750
me with or your or it goes to Ellis too because you left called the glory.

4342
01:44:46.770 --> 01:44:46.861
No,

4343
01:44:46.861 --> 01:44:46.981
no,

4344
01:44:46.981 --> 01:44:47.990
everybody is the same.

4345
01:44:48.170 --> 01:44:49.760
You know when I said he had a glass jaw,

4346
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:50.623
I didn't say that.

4347
01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:51.710
Look,

4348
01:44:51.710 --> 01:44:53.360
if he will closest friend,

4349
01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:54.440
I would mention it.

4350
01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:55.101
You know,

4351
01:44:55.101 --> 01:44:56.930
we did not many people need to know,

4352
01:44:57.110 --> 01:44:57.501
but then,

4353
01:44:57.501 --> 01:44:57.741
you know,

4354
01:44:57.741 --> 01:44:58.491
otherwise I say it,

4355
01:44:58.491 --> 01:45:00.560
I said about gave last because I love game of Alaska.

4356
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:01.460
I think he's a great fighter,

4357
01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:01.761
but I,

4358
01:45:01.761 --> 01:45:02.151
you know,

4359
01:45:02.151 --> 01:45:02.380
he's,

4360
01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:03.690
he's not a super strong chin,

4361
01:45:04.090 --> 01:45:04.420
you know,

4362
01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:05.780
but he's an unbelievable fighter.

4363
01:45:05.781 --> 01:45:06.800
You can see what you can do.

4364
01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:07.911
You know what I mean?

4365
01:45:07.911 --> 01:45:09.140
He took it to her junior.

4366
01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:10.890
The sound so amazing.

4367
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.570
Is this fight going to happen now because I don't know any more.

4368
01:45:13.730 --> 01:45:14.950
Junior or first was hunters that,

4369
01:45:14.951 --> 01:45:15.500
oh yes.

4370
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:16.333
Oh my God.

4371
01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:20.010
That's going to be a junior man.

4372
01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:21.290
Yeah,

4373
01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:21.980
I love,

4374
01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:25.100
I love when guys like you hear about that fine and go,

4375
01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:25.993
oh,

4376
01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:28.320
you don't know man.

4377
01:45:28.321 --> 01:45:29.990
I know he has Marcos Hunt.

4378
01:45:29.991 --> 01:45:32.630
You can't knock him out to do as our mother fucker.

4379
01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:33.321
Well,

4380
01:45:33.321 --> 01:45:34.250
you can knock them out.

4381
01:45:34.251 --> 01:45:37.100
I mean the Melvin Malcolm and you see that fight.

4382
01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:37.851
Okay.

4383
01:45:37.851 --> 01:45:39.620
Watch defining slow motion.

4384
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:42.680
I bet you because we are still cups in Holland,

4385
01:45:42.681 --> 01:45:43.250
right?

4386
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:44.061
He knocks him down.

4387
01:45:44.061 --> 01:45:44.331
Yes,

4388
01:45:44.331 --> 01:45:44.580
she,

4389
01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:45.050
he lose.

4390
01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:45.710
He falls forward.

4391
01:45:45.710 --> 01:45:47.150
But hunt falls on his cup.

4392
01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:50.570
Watch you see book hitting the Cup at any flights down I go,

4393
01:45:50.690 --> 01:45:51.910
I guarantee you the extra.

4394
01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:52.111
Yeah,

4395
01:45:52.111 --> 01:45:54.440
there's Steel Cup put sealed the deal.

4396
01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.810
Know Steel Decay,

4397
01:45:55.850 --> 01:45:59.690
but I remember Mirko Cro cop kicking him with his freaking shit in the face and

4398
01:45:59.691 --> 01:46:00.560
he just took a knee.

4399
01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:00.921
No,

4400
01:46:00.921 --> 01:46:04.310
the first time he did a flinch at all and the second time he took a knee and he

4401
01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:06.760
got up like freaking terminator and it kept going.

4402
01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:07.580
Super Samoan.

4403
01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:08.391
Scary Guy,

4404
01:46:08.391 --> 01:46:08.841
man.

4405
01:46:08.841 --> 01:46:09.291
He can,

4406
01:46:09.291 --> 01:46:10.160
he can bang,

4407
01:46:10.890 --> 01:46:11.250
Bang.

4408
01:46:11.250 --> 01:46:13.870
You see that right on the spot there,

4409
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:15.500
right on this bug where you hit that hook,

4410
01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:17.720
that overhand Hizo way,

4411
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:21.440
way more experienced striker than anybody else in the UFC.

4412
01:46:21.710 --> 01:46:25.510
He said the only thing that guys in on his level as far as experiences Allister,

4413
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:27.260
cause he's the only other guy that won the Grand Prix.

4414
01:46:27.290 --> 01:46:27.770
Yup.

4415
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:29.690
And Allison won the Grand Prix clean.

4416
01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:30.531
Whereas,

4417
01:46:30.531 --> 01:46:30.920
um,

4418
01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:35.420
hunt one it because that crazy Friday I would race SFO and then ray Sefo

4419
01:46:35.421 --> 01:46:36.350
couldn't continue.

4420
01:46:36.351 --> 01:46:39.800
So he went and he took race F I was placing one it right.

4421
01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:40.581
You know,

4422
01:46:40.581 --> 01:46:40.941
but yeah,

4423
01:46:40.941 --> 01:46:41.200
yeah,

4424
01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:41.420
yeah,

4425
01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:41.631
yeah.

4426
01:46:41.631 --> 01:46:42.290
No he did.

4427
01:46:42.290 --> 01:46:45.290
But I think got to say a Saki normally because I ended up,

4428
01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:46.130
when they spar,

4429
01:46:46.130 --> 01:46:46.581
you know,

4430
01:46:46.581 --> 01:46:48.170
I know who is half yeah.

4431
01:46:48.171 --> 01:46:48.441
But,

4432
01:46:48.441 --> 01:46:48.651
uh,

4433
01:46:48.651 --> 01:46:53.010
over Anna and [inaudible] to the finals with a broken hand and a broken arm,

4434
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.761
you know,

4435
01:46:53.761 --> 01:46:54.361
so we,

4436
01:46:54.361 --> 01:46:54.601
uh,

4437
01:46:54.601 --> 01:46:58.740
so that would be a great five between the two of those when both are healthy.

4438
01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:04.880
I love the fact that a k k one it's not really k one as much as it is glory now.

4439
01:47:05.581 --> 01:47:06.414
And uh,

4440
01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:06.810
you know,

4441
01:47:06.810 --> 01:47:07.340
there was a,

4442
01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:07.610
there's,

4443
01:47:07.610 --> 01:47:11.460
there's just been more high level kickboxing on television these days.

4444
01:47:11.461 --> 01:47:12.660
It's really coming back.

4445
01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:13.590
It's a great show.

4446
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:14.730
It really is a great show,

4447
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:15.091
you know,

4448
01:47:15.091 --> 01:47:15.924
and uh,

4449
01:47:15.980 --> 01:47:17.160
such high level strikes.

4450
01:47:17.161 --> 01:47:18.180
I was here at,

4451
01:47:18.181 --> 01:47:19.014
uh,

4452
01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:19.771
at the airport,

4453
01:47:19.771 --> 01:47:20.461
they're the casino.

4454
01:47:20.461 --> 01:47:21.450
They have there somewhere,

4455
01:47:21.451 --> 01:47:21.980
you know,

4456
01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:23.010
on a century.

4457
01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:25.830
I was there about four weeks ago.

4458
01:47:25.831 --> 01:47:29.130
There was a glory show and I was amazed with the teller they had here.

4459
01:47:29.490 --> 01:47:33.360
Like I was truly amazed to kickbox and tells coming from America and uh,

4460
01:47:33.361 --> 01:47:34.830
that was not in the past like this,

4461
01:47:34.831 --> 01:47:35.161
you know,

4462
01:47:35.161 --> 01:47:36.570
and these guys look really good.

4463
01:47:36.690 --> 01:47:36.841
Well,

4464
01:47:36.841 --> 01:47:40.440
I think MMA is fed it to the point where everybody realized how important

4465
01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.780
[inaudible] skills are to win an MMA.

4466
01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:45.720
And then more people started gravitating towards Moy Moitai.

4467
01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:46.050
Yup.

4468
01:47:46.050 --> 01:47:46.800
And then,

4469
01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:47.161
you know,

4470
01:47:47.161 --> 01:47:48.160
I think we're,

4471
01:47:48.170 --> 01:47:50.760
we're seeing when you see the highest level,

4472
01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:53.720
like you see like a Giorgio Petrosian or something like that,

4473
01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:55.740
like a real high level technical guy.

4474
01:47:55.741 --> 01:47:57.090
Like you realize like wow,

4475
01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.140
the level of striking,

4476
01:47:58.141 --> 01:47:59.670
which is probably the most entertaining,

4477
01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:01.560
entertaining and exciting part of MMA.

4478
01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:01.830
Yeah.

4479
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:05.790
The level of striking is way higher in like high level kickboxing that it is an

4480
01:48:05.791 --> 01:48:06.624
MMA right.

4481
01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:07.550
Way Higher.

4482
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:07.860
No,

4483
01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:08.480
for sure.

4484
01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.690
Like Anderson I think could,

4485
01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:11.300
could Pete and high level kickboxing,

4486
01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:12.300
you know,

4487
01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:15.590
still shop at the high cakes like his knees and,

4488
01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:19.410
and he's crazy like Trump kitchen timing and his hands are specifically really

4489
01:48:19.411 --> 01:48:19.920
good.

4490
01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:22.230
I don't know if he's got a really good roundhouse kick to the head.

4491
01:48:22.231 --> 01:48:24.200
I never really see a meg that you shouldn't have common.

4492
01:48:24.210 --> 01:48:25.640
Like in the past it,

4493
01:48:25.650 --> 01:48:27.090
you should in the SEC first round,

4494
01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.160
they're fine to you if she,

4495
01:48:29.170 --> 01:48:29.641
yeah,

4496
01:48:29.641 --> 01:48:30.061
that's true.

4497
01:48:30.061 --> 01:48:30.331
Okay,

4498
01:48:30.331 --> 01:48:30.541
good,

4499
01:48:30.541 --> 01:48:30.691
good,

4500
01:48:30.691 --> 01:48:30.811
good,

4501
01:48:30.811 --> 01:48:30.931
good.

4502
01:48:30.931 --> 01:48:31.291
Roundhouse.

4503
01:48:31.291 --> 01:48:31.981
Kicked him in the face,

4504
01:48:31.981 --> 01:48:32.521
stunned them.

4505
01:48:32.521 --> 01:48:34.920
Then the bell rang and then he finished him off in the next round.

4506
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:35.310
Yeah.

4507
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:37.230
It gets to chill.

4508
01:48:37.231 --> 01:48:39.540
He threw it from a weird angle I thought.

4509
01:48:39.541 --> 01:48:40.201
And I go like,

4510
01:48:40.201 --> 01:48:40.800
Whoa Dad.

4511
01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:41.220
But uh,

4512
01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:42.180
I think it was just,

4513
01:48:42.181 --> 01:48:42.720
he was,

4514
01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:43.890
he was too excited to fight,

4515
01:48:43.891 --> 01:48:44.610
chill.

4516
01:48:44.610 --> 01:48:46.920
And he really wants at the time on it though.

4517
01:48:46.921 --> 01:48:50.280
And that's when you start making those little like Ms. Gay mistakes that fight

4518
01:48:50.281 --> 01:48:54.240
with Stephan Bonner fight was the most brutal version of Anderson Silva.

4519
01:48:54.241 --> 01:48:54.990
That was incredible.

4520
01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:55.560
That was,

4521
01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:56.970
I was literally,

4522
01:48:56.971 --> 01:48:57.301
if I,

4523
01:48:57.301 --> 01:48:59.760
there was a moment in my life and my mouth was open.

4524
01:48:59.761 --> 01:49:01.710
That was the moment when he just moved back,

4525
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:02.161
move,

4526
01:49:02.161 --> 01:49:02.371
move.

4527
01:49:02.371 --> 01:49:03.051
And it goes boof,

4528
01:49:03.051 --> 01:49:04.530
pressed against the cage.

4529
01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:07.680
I go home and he stopped him with that needle.

4530
01:49:07.681 --> 01:49:09.120
And Stephan Bonner,

4531
01:49:09.121 --> 01:49:09.511
of course,

4532
01:49:09.511 --> 01:49:10.310
I've been in Brazil,

4533
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.860
Forrest,

4534
01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:11.693
Forrest Griffin,

4535
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:12.610
Forrest Griffin was,

4536
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:14.160
that was in my mind.

4537
01:49:14.161 --> 01:49:16.470
That was just unbelievable.

4538
01:49:16.471 --> 01:49:17.880
It was just the most amazing thing ever.

4539
01:49:17.970 --> 01:49:18.781
He manhandled them.

4540
01:49:18.781 --> 01:49:19.860
So moving,

4541
01:49:19.861 --> 01:49:23.610
letting miss cause that mission and go Boehnke ride on that button.

4542
01:49:23.611 --> 01:49:23.911
You know?

4543
01:49:23.911 --> 01:49:24.930
So beautiful.

4544
01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:25.920
He's so accurate.

4545
01:49:25.921 --> 01:49:27.120
Do you think he's the best ever?

4546
01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:27.841
You know?

4547
01:49:27.841 --> 01:49:28.170
Yeah.

4548
01:49:28.170 --> 01:49:28.381
Yeah.

4549
01:49:28.381 --> 01:49:29.540
He's up there with Federer.

4550
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:33.060
I still put up Darryl so I cannot all these great fights.

4551
01:49:33.061 --> 01:49:33.600
We saw it.

4552
01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:34.260
Pride.

4553
01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:35.380
It's gotta be up there man.

4554
01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:35.731
Because,

4555
01:49:35.731 --> 01:49:36.091
but yeah,

4556
01:49:36.091 --> 01:49:37.080
he right now,

4557
01:49:37.170 --> 01:49:37.651
I mean,

4558
01:49:37.651 --> 01:49:38.220
who gets stopped,

4559
01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:39.300
fade or in his prime,

4560
01:49:39.301 --> 01:49:41.390
like the Nogueira days wouldn't beat Noguera.

4561
01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:43.320
He was unbelievable when he beat Cro cop,

4562
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:44.383
you know,

4563
01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:45.810
he was so good back then.

4564
01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:47.100
She's beating

4565
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:49.450
<v 4>and the way he did it,</v>

4566
01:49:49.451 --> 01:49:50.420
so called

4567
01:49:51.090 --> 01:49:55.830
<v 0>I will love to see as prime or prime fade or versus a prime Cain Velasquez.</v>

4568
01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:56.760
Yeah.

4569
01:49:56.760 --> 01:49:58.420
If we could go back in time with,

4570
01:49:58.421 --> 01:49:59.011
with Kane,

4571
01:49:59.011 --> 01:50:02.140
take the cane of today back or fight fade or Ooh,

4572
01:50:02.250 --> 01:50:02.470
yeah,

4573
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:03.210
yeah.

4574
01:50:03.210 --> 01:50:04.560
That would have been an amazing fight.

4575
01:50:04.650 --> 01:50:05.040
Yeah.

4576
01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:05.850
Good stuff.

4577
01:50:05.850 --> 01:50:06.130
Yeah.

4578
01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:10.260
We were so lucky now to see this evolution of Shit and Cain is another one of

4579
01:50:10.261 --> 01:50:11.310
those guys that just,

4580
01:50:11.311 --> 01:50:11.640
uh,

4581
01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:11.911
you know,

4582
01:50:11.911 --> 01:50:13.290
he's got a full skillset,

4583
01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:13.740
throws,

4584
01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:14.371
leg kicks,

4585
01:50:14.371 --> 01:50:14.971
head kicks,

4586
01:50:14.971 --> 01:50:15.511
punches,

4587
01:50:15.511 --> 01:50:15.970
you know,

4588
01:50:15.970 --> 01:50:17.050
<v 4>and the stamina.</v>

4589
01:50:17.051 --> 01:50:17.771
I love that.

4590
01:50:17.771 --> 01:50:20.490
Although in the junior dos Santos Friday start running out again,

4591
01:50:20.491 --> 01:50:21.000
it's also,

4592
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:21.311
you know,

4593
01:50:21.311 --> 01:50:22.600
not to lift this pace,

4594
01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:24.130
but the strength got away,

4595
01:50:24.131 --> 01:50:24.401
you know,

4596
01:50:24.401 --> 01:50:25.620
to ground and pound was not,

4597
01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:26.740
not effective anymore,

4598
01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:27.910
not to knock them out.

4599
01:50:27.911 --> 01:50:29.410
And we threw 100 million punches.

4600
01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:31.960
Nobody's is saying what heavyweight.

4601
01:50:32.170 --> 01:50:33.003
And everybody goes,

4602
01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:33.210
well,

4603
01:50:33.210 --> 01:50:34.510
one guy told me one time,

4604
01:50:34.511 --> 01:50:34.870
uh,

4605
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:35.181
I say,

4606
01:50:35.181 --> 01:50:35.291
yeah,

4607
01:50:35.291 --> 01:50:36.101
but I'm heavyweight to say,

4608
01:50:36.101 --> 01:50:36.371
well look,

4609
01:50:36.371 --> 01:50:37.204
okay for [inaudible].

4610
01:50:37.210 --> 01:50:37.571
And he goes,

4611
01:50:37.571 --> 01:50:38.620
Yo buddy trains really hard.

4612
01:50:38.650 --> 01:50:39.483
And I go,

4613
01:50:39.670 --> 01:50:40.503
really did,

4614
01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:41.510
that's,

4615
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:42.141
that's the answer.

4616
01:50:42.141 --> 01:50:42.440
You

4617
01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:43.470
<v 0>give it to yourself.</v>

4618
01:50:43.471 --> 01:50:44.010
Well,

4619
01:50:44.010 --> 01:50:45.270
three really hard.

4620
01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:45.720
Um,

4621
01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:46.131
he was,

4622
01:50:46.131 --> 01:50:47.750
he's a relatively small heavyweight.

4623
01:50:47.751 --> 01:50:49.610
He's a little heavier than you at about two 40,

4624
01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:51.560
but realistically cane,

4625
01:50:51.561 --> 01:50:52.550
when you look at him has,

4626
01:50:52.590 --> 01:50:54.020
he carries more body fat as well.

4627
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:54.320
Yeah.

4628
01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:54.591
You know,

4629
01:50:54.591 --> 01:50:55.730
it's interesting how the,

4630
01:50:55.810 --> 01:50:58.280
it seems like that's about as big as you need to get.

4631
01:50:58.310 --> 01:51:01.830
Like those big 265 pound guys that cut weight and get you,

4632
01:51:01.831 --> 01:51:02.040
you,

4633
01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:02.190
oh,

4634
01:51:02.190 --> 01:51:03.340
you almost sacrifice something.

4635
01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:04.580
<v 4>You do always,</v>

4636
01:51:04.610 --> 01:51:04.881
always.

4637
01:51:04.881 --> 01:51:08.990
And I think the cane has that burning inside from his family and know what they

4638
01:51:08.991 --> 01:51:11.420
showed on TV when they did those specials on them.

4639
01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:13.370
And then he wants to provide for his family.

4640
01:51:13.371 --> 01:51:13.781
He's got the,

4641
01:51:13.781 --> 01:51:14.091
the whole,

4642
01:51:14.091 --> 01:51:14.361
you know,

4643
01:51:14.361 --> 01:51:18.590
his old fun and work in heart and he's got that mentality and I think a guy like

4644
01:51:18.591 --> 01:51:19.340
that,

4645
01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:19.671
you know,

4646
01:51:19.671 --> 01:51:23.690
that is a hard guy to beat and he will always be ready.

4647
01:51:23.691 --> 01:51:24.980
That punch with junit or sons.

4648
01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:28.090
The first time I thought Ken was going to beat him exactly the way,

4649
01:51:28.091 --> 01:51:30.890
yes he did the second time because I thought,

4650
01:51:30.891 --> 01:51:30.981
oh,

4651
01:51:30.981 --> 01:51:31.940
he's going to outwork work him.

4652
01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:36.860
[inaudible] but junior never had anybody pressing as hard as Kane can do and

4653
01:51:36.861 --> 01:51:39.980
he's going to have work coming in a championship runs probably he might seal the

4654
01:51:39.981 --> 01:51:40.670
deal there.

4655
01:51:40.670 --> 01:51:42.870
But then he got hit with that also that the,

4656
01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:46.340
I mean you can't say take anything away from junior and it was a vicious

4657
01:51:46.341 --> 01:51:47.174
knockout striker,

4658
01:51:47.450 --> 01:51:47.880
cro,

4659
01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:48.391
cop out.

4660
01:51:48.391 --> 01:51:50.570
He talked to everybody for Dumas to everybody,

4661
01:51:50.571 --> 01:51:51.010
you know?

4662
01:51:51.010 --> 01:51:51.470
Yeah,

4663
01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:51.591
yeah.

4664
01:51:51.591 --> 01:51:52.370
He's an animal.

4665
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:53.620
He really units that we're doomed.

4666
01:51:53.630 --> 01:51:53.940
Knockout.

4667
01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:54.720
It was brutal.

4668
01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:58.340
But the difference being that Cain Velasquez was injured in that fight.

4669
01:51:58.370 --> 01:51:58.581
I mean,

4670
01:51:58.581 --> 01:51:59.690
he had a pretty serious,

4671
01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:01.640
serious knee injury,

4672
01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:04.700
like he couldn't move and then you'll focus will be on that injury.

4673
01:52:04.750 --> 01:52:05.870
It's always like that.

4674
01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:06.181
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

4675
01:52:06.181 --> 01:52:06.541
So he,

4676
01:52:06.541 --> 01:52:08.190
he wasn't able to really,

4677
01:52:08.210 --> 01:52:08.550
uh,

4678
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:09.270
you know,

4679
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:10.660
like attack and have the,

4680
01:52:10.661 --> 01:52:10.960
the,

4681
01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:12.300
the mobility that he likes.

4682
01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:12.650
We mean,

4683
01:52:12.650 --> 01:52:14.970
the second fight was all about him moving forward and that's it.

4684
01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:17.600
<v 4>Taking away the striking and it puts that pace on,</v>

4685
01:52:17.601 --> 01:52:18.434
you know,

4686
01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:19.400
nobody could stop that.

4687
01:52:19.401 --> 01:52:20.450
You would know Matt Horwitz.

4688
01:52:20.451 --> 01:52:21.284
Right?

4689
01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:21.831
I mean,

4690
01:52:21.831 --> 01:52:23.480
he has almost no striking skills,

4691
01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:24.091
but he,

4692
01:52:24.091 --> 01:52:25.580
his stuff and he's got stamina,

4693
01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:26.510
you know,

4694
01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:28.400
and when he fought Mike Pyle,

4695
01:52:28.401 --> 01:52:29.630
I never forget this,

4696
01:52:29.950 --> 01:52:30.380
uh,

4697
01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:34.360
he beat my pile with a combination on the ground to the east Sacramento,

4698
01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:35.031
a submission,

4699
01:52:35.031 --> 01:52:35.990
which blew me away,

4700
01:52:36.130 --> 01:52:36.320
you know?

4701
01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.280
But he outworked him,

4702
01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:37.611
you know,

4703
01:52:37.611 --> 01:52:38.480
he's just got be tired.

4704
01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:42.440
And a later I overheard them talking and then a horse,

4705
01:52:42.441 --> 01:52:42.891
he says,

4706
01:52:42.891 --> 01:52:43.820
he's like freaking,

4707
01:52:43.821 --> 01:52:44.450
uh,

4708
01:52:44.450 --> 01:52:45.283
what is it,

4709
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:46.183
rain man,

4710
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:46.680
you know,

4711
01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:46.951
he,

4712
01:52:46.951 --> 01:52:47.750
he said,

4713
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:48.020
yeah,

4714
01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:48.271
yeah,

4715
01:52:48.271 --> 01:52:48.670
I know.

4716
01:52:48.670 --> 01:52:48.920
Yeah,

4717
01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:49.753
I know that you did.

4718
01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:50.990
You did it on four years ago.

4719
01:52:50.991 --> 01:52:52.760
I was rolling with you and you did that to me.

4720
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:54.740
So I knew that was what the character was going to be.

4721
01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:59.120
He knew he rememberable four years ago.

4722
01:52:59.120 --> 01:52:59.430
He's a,

4723
01:52:59.430 --> 01:53:00.590
he's a strange cat.

4724
01:53:00.591 --> 01:53:01.141
Matt Hart,

4725
01:53:01.141 --> 01:53:02.780
she's a great guy to a beautiful,

4726
01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:06.170
he loves to cutting weight is fasting for him.

4727
01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:06.921
He says,

4728
01:53:06.921 --> 01:53:07.101
Oh,

4729
01:53:07.101 --> 01:53:08.570
I love to fans,

4730
01:53:08.571 --> 01:53:09.710
love the trees.

4731
01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:12.470
I love the university.

4732
01:53:12.471 --> 01:53:15.680
All of its potential possibilities in the multiverse,

4733
01:53:15.681 --> 01:53:16.511
like if you hear him tell,

4734
01:53:16.511 --> 01:53:17.344
I love this guy,

4735
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:19.460
but he's a sweetheart of a guy and you're a very,

4736
01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:20.480
very tough guy too.

4737
01:53:20.481 --> 01:53:20.900
I mean,

4738
01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:22.840
and knocked out Benji radic but a headcase.

4739
01:53:23.850 --> 01:53:24.840
Crazy was that fun.

4740
01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:25.570
But again,

4741
01:53:25.570 --> 01:53:28.790
I was working and there are always these examples.

4742
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.720
I always,

4743
01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:31.370
he makes the most the best.

4744
01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:35.750
Most technical fighters in the world makes him look like crap because why?

4745
01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:39.980
He can't take a punch and you just come forward and then you can be a great

4746
01:53:39.981 --> 01:53:40.520
striker.

4747
01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:42.290
You cannot strike moving backwards.

4748
01:53:42.370 --> 01:53:43.460
If you really push it,

4749
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:46.730
you shut down the whole striking and that's how you find a great striker and

4750
01:53:46.731 --> 01:53:47.061
Matt Hall,

4751
01:53:47.061 --> 01:53:49.880
which is an interesting guy because he's not burdened down with ego.

4752
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:52.970
I think a lot of guys with all their macho bullshit,

4753
01:53:52.971 --> 01:53:54.800
like you talk a lot of shit before a fight.

4754
01:53:55.010 --> 01:53:56.790
You carry that around with you like that,

4755
01:53:56.791 --> 01:54:00.290
that that becomes like a weight that you carry when you get inside that cage.

4756
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.860
When you,

4757
01:54:00.860 --> 01:54:01.850
when you say,

4758
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:05.320
I'm going to rip his head of his shit in his negative all day,

4759
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.631
you know,

4760
01:54:05.631 --> 01:54:06.890
you know those kinds of things.

4761
01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:11.240
You have to understand that at the moment you have to go to the fight.

4762
01:54:11.330 --> 01:54:16.330
They play that clip on the big screen and you see yourself saying that and now

4763
01:54:16.341 --> 01:54:17.174
you're going to go,

4764
01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:20.210
I better do it and that's boom right away,

4765
01:54:20.211 --> 01:54:21.170
weight on your shoulders.

4766
01:54:21.171 --> 01:54:21.930
You should never do.

4767
01:54:21.930 --> 01:54:23.480
That's why I never did stare downs.

4768
01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:24.830
I don't like to get angry.

4769
01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:25.730
I don't want it to make,

4770
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:28.760
I like to say little things in interviews that pissed him off.

4771
01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:32.150
So hopefully they get really angry at me like that a whole thing with chemo.

4772
01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:34.250
Leopoldo I never asked for him,

4773
01:54:34.251 --> 01:54:34.820
you know,

4774
01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:35.241
but they,

4775
01:54:35.241 --> 01:54:35.660
they,

4776
01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:36.321
they said that,

4777
01:54:36.321 --> 01:54:36.740
oh,

4778
01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:37.580
I went to the,

4779
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:39.860
to the photo shoot for my last fight,

4780
01:54:39.861 --> 01:54:40.910
was that a WFA?

4781
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:42.780
And he was there and I say,

4782
01:54:42.781 --> 01:54:43.200
Hey Kim,

4783
01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:43.701
how are you doing?

4784
01:54:43.701 --> 01:54:45.560
And he shook my hand and he looked right away your way.

4785
01:54:45.561 --> 01:54:46.040
And I go,

4786
01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:46.401
wow.

4787
01:54:46.401 --> 01:54:47.450
I go to Jeremy Lab.

4788
01:54:47.451 --> 01:54:47.741
And I said,

4789
01:54:47.741 --> 01:54:49.370
why he was taking this fights areas,

4790
01:54:49.371 --> 01:54:49.970
right?

4791
01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:50.331
And he says,

4792
01:54:50.331 --> 01:54:50.511
yeah,

4793
01:54:50.511 --> 01:54:52.340
we told him that she specifically asked for him.

4794
01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:53.500
I said,

4795
01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:54.291
why would you say that?

4796
01:54:54.291 --> 01:54:54.710
Well,

4797
01:54:54.710 --> 01:54:55.300
that gets him,

4798
01:54:55.300 --> 01:54:55.561
you know,

4799
01:54:55.561 --> 01:54:56.391
and it gets a little angry.

4800
01:54:56.391 --> 01:54:57.230
It's better for the fight.

4801
01:54:57.710 --> 01:54:58.250
And I go,

4802
01:54:58.250 --> 01:54:58.641
okay.

4803
01:54:58.641 --> 01:55:02.180
So I figured I'm not gonna say anything because then at least he will train very

4804
01:55:02.181 --> 01:55:02.421
art,

4805
01:55:02.421 --> 01:55:02.700
you know,

4806
01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:03.650
we're going to get a good fight.

4807
01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:04.431
But,

4808
01:55:04.431 --> 01:55:04.820
uh,

4809
01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:06.990
I always thought that I specifically asked for my,

4810
01:55:06.991 --> 01:55:07.590
I did a day,

4811
01:55:07.590 --> 01:55:07.851
they say,

4812
01:55:07.851 --> 01:55:07.980
well,

4813
01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:08.451
you want to fight.

4814
01:55:08.451 --> 01:55:10.280
I say Haitian and they say,

4815
01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:10.881
why?

4816
01:55:10.881 --> 01:55:11.121
I said,

4817
01:55:11.121 --> 01:55:11.271
well,

4818
01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:12.290
they always say he's the best.

4819
01:55:12.291 --> 01:55:14.780
So I would like to testify skellies and now we don't have the money for that.

4820
01:55:15.190 --> 01:55:17.660
I saw much money would've crossed for you to find Hixon Gracie.

4821
01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:18.590
Oh,

4822
01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:20.300
now how much would it back then?

4823
01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:20.961
I would,

4824
01:55:20.961 --> 01:55:21.681
for the same thing,

4825
01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:23.990
I would fired for to Hickson.

4826
01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:26.840
They said they couldn't afford them.

4827
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:27.591
They said they couldn't.

4828
01:55:27.591 --> 01:55:27.801
Oh,

4829
01:55:27.801 --> 01:55:28.400
for him.

4830
01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:28.761
Okay.

4831
01:55:28.761 --> 01:55:28.881
Oh,

4832
01:55:28.881 --> 01:55:30.950
for me it was two 50 at the time.

4833
01:55:30.951 --> 01:55:31.940
How much would they pay Hicks?

4834
01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:32.803
How much did it?

4835
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:34.160
I think a 6 million.

4836
01:55:34.161 --> 01:55:34.601
No subjects.

4837
01:55:34.601 --> 01:55:36.110
So I something high,

4838
01:55:36.370 --> 01:55:36.741
something.

4839
01:55:36.741 --> 01:55:37.431
I don't know.

4840
01:55:37.431 --> 01:55:37.851
I don't know.

4841
01:55:37.851 --> 01:55:39.050
But I heard really great.

4842
01:55:39.051 --> 01:55:39.740
You know,

4843
01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:40.690
whenever you read any of that,

4844
01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.510
we know better.

4845
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.961
Don't believe it,

4846
01:55:41.961 --> 01:55:42.621
but no,

4847
01:55:42.621 --> 01:55:43.680
it really number.

4848
01:55:43.890 --> 01:55:44.040
But

4849
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:44.671
<v 5>I just thought,</v>

4850
01:55:44.671 --> 01:55:44.971
you know,

4851
01:55:44.971 --> 01:55:47.190
I would love to because I have nothing.

4852
01:55:47.191 --> 01:55:47.520
You know,

4853
01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:49.440
each of the night we met in China,

4854
01:55:49.441 --> 01:55:50.101
everything's cool.

4855
01:55:50.101 --> 01:55:50.311
You know,

4856
01:55:50.311 --> 01:55:52.320
there's nothing going on because he is,

4857
01:55:52.321 --> 01:55:53.220
he's a really nice guy

4858
01:55:54.170 --> 01:55:55.430
<v 0>who was talking about hoists.</v>

4859
01:55:55.431 --> 01:55:58.250
Gracie won the very first UFC and hoists Gracie,

4860
01:55:58.251 --> 01:56:03.251
who's a brilliant Brazilian Jujitsu practitioner who really kind of expose

4861
01:56:03.751 --> 01:56:06.210
Brazilian Jujitsu to America and it showed it to a,

4862
01:56:06.211 --> 01:56:07.044
showcased it.

4863
01:56:07.370 --> 01:56:10.250
His brother was the champion of the family.

4864
01:56:10.251 --> 01:56:11.001
His brother,

4865
01:56:11.001 --> 01:56:15.500
apparently by all counts is the greatest Brazilian Jujitsu artists tower.

4866
01:56:15.770 --> 01:56:18.890
And everybody who rolls with them pretty much universally says this,

4867
01:56:18.891 --> 01:56:20.750
that Hickson has just on this other level.

4868
01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:21.230
So you,

4869
01:56:21.230 --> 01:56:22.280
you wanted to fight him,

4870
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.650
Huh?

4871
01:56:22.650 --> 01:56:25.070
<v 5>Just for that I write and even that will go into ground.</v>

4872
01:56:25.071 --> 01:56:25.531
That would like,

4873
01:56:25.531 --> 01:56:27.060
because at that time I thought I chest,

4874
01:56:27.061 --> 01:56:27.480
well,

4875
01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.570
I just want to see you in Japan,

4876
01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:31.980
<v 0>in pancreas when you won the king of Pancrase,</v>

4877
01:56:32.250 --> 01:56:34.470
he had also won Japan valley too though.

4878
01:56:34.471 --> 01:56:36.000
Like within the year of that,

4879
01:56:36.001 --> 01:56:36.340
right.

4880
01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:38.650
<v 5>He was sitting there when I was in the boot of gun,</v>

4881
01:56:38.651 --> 01:56:40.340
knocked the guy out and,

4882
01:56:40.430 --> 01:56:43.570
and that was at a time when they were on the cover of black belt magazine saying

4883
01:56:43.571 --> 01:56:45.220
that up Andras this show.

4884
01:56:45.221 --> 01:56:45.341
I,

4885
01:56:45.341 --> 01:56:45.671
you know,

4886
01:56:45.671 --> 01:56:46.301
needless to say,

4887
01:56:46.301 --> 01:56:46.541
I say,

4888
01:56:46.541 --> 01:56:46.811
okay,

4889
01:56:46.811 --> 01:56:48.070
then I want to test the skills.

4890
01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:48.971
And that's,

4891
01:56:48.971 --> 01:56:49.360
uh,

4892
01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:50.620
that's where I actually challenged him.

4893
01:56:50.621 --> 01:56:51.131
I said,

4894
01:56:51.131 --> 01:56:51.371
hey,

4895
01:56:51.371 --> 01:56:52.780
I would like to fight you.

4896
01:56:52.781 --> 01:56:53.740
I don't mind the rules.

4897
01:56:53.741 --> 01:56:54.491
We will bend the rules.

4898
01:56:54.491 --> 01:56:55.001
Who will make any,

4899
01:56:55.001 --> 01:56:55.840
any real anytime.

4900
01:56:55.841 --> 01:56:56.331
And what happened,

4901
01:56:56.331 --> 01:56:56.690
you know,

4902
01:56:56.690 --> 01:56:57.840
and it never happens.

4903
01:56:57.841 --> 01:56:58.040
You know,

4904
01:56:58.040 --> 01:56:59.200
he tried to do it for pride.

4905
01:56:59.201 --> 01:57:00.050
Is that what you're trying to do with that?

4906
01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:01.060
What if bankwest was there?

4907
01:57:01.061 --> 01:57:01.570
But I said,

4908
01:57:01.570 --> 01:57:03.460
I don't mind any organization anywhere.

4909
01:57:03.461 --> 01:57:03.690
You know,

4910
01:57:03.690 --> 01:57:04.880
I left,

4911
01:57:04.930 --> 01:57:06.390
this fight happened and he didn't want me.

4912
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:09.780
Once I put the fans to decide to,

4913
01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:11.740
to care about for fining,

4914
01:57:11.950 --> 01:57:12.281
you know,

4915
01:57:12.281 --> 01:57:13.690
if you really as a fighter,

4916
01:57:13.691 --> 01:57:16.420
go in fighting for yourself,

4917
01:57:16.450 --> 01:57:17.410
it doesn't really matter.

4918
01:57:17.500 --> 01:57:18.880
I always told my guys like this,

4919
01:57:18.881 --> 01:57:19.714
if it,

4920
01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:21.550
they put me with Randy couture in this room.

4921
01:57:21.551 --> 01:57:22.900
They looked the room and we fight.

4922
01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:24.940
It doesn't really matter who wins,

4923
01:57:25.170 --> 01:57:25.450
you know,

4924
01:57:25.450 --> 01:57:26.530
if he's better at that day,

4925
01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:26.981
he wins.

4926
01:57:26.981 --> 01:57:27.521
If I'm better,

4927
01:57:27.521 --> 01:57:27.921
I'm when,

4928
01:57:27.921 --> 01:57:28.151
you know,

4929
01:57:28.151 --> 01:57:28.720
it does.

4930
01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:32.710
But the what is hard for a fighters to come out and all these people know and

4931
01:57:32.711 --> 01:57:34.960
that Chris Leben said it very funny one time on our show.

4932
01:57:34.961 --> 01:57:35.440
He says he had,

4933
01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:39.250
the guy at blockbuster told me what I should have done when I fought Anderson

4934
01:57:39.250 --> 01:57:39.490
Silva,

4935
01:57:39.490 --> 01:57:40.180
you know,

4936
01:57:40.180 --> 01:57:40.871
and then I say,

4937
01:57:40.871 --> 01:57:41.100
yeah,

4938
01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:43.810
he's seen a lot of fighters care about that.

4939
01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:45.640
I always say the fight is what we say.

4940
01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:47.020
I fight for my family wrong,

4941
01:57:47.050 --> 01:57:47.710
right away.

4942
01:57:47.710 --> 01:57:48.461
Fight for yourself,

4943
01:57:48.461 --> 01:57:49.470
man for your fight.

4944
01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:49.810
A fight.

4945
01:57:49.810 --> 01:57:50.740
If you fight for yourself,

4946
01:57:50.741 --> 01:57:51.341
you fight the best.

4947
01:57:51.341 --> 01:57:54.970
If you really don't give a damn about anybody what they think you fight really

4948
01:57:54.971 --> 01:57:56.740
the best because it is not bad,

4949
01:57:56.741 --> 01:57:57.574
too loose.

4950
01:57:57.580 --> 01:57:57.911
You know,

4951
01:57:57.911 --> 01:58:01.990
everybody can have that day and that that's the mind set I had with the action.

4952
01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:02.471
You know?

4953
01:58:02.471 --> 01:58:03.880
Although I thought it was going to beat him,

4954
01:58:04.090 --> 01:58:04.811
but I would say,

4955
01:58:04.811 --> 01:58:05.051
you know,

4956
01:58:05.051 --> 01:58:06.100
it doesn't really matter.

4957
01:58:06.101 --> 01:58:09.040
This is testing the skill against somebody who everybody thinks is the best guy

4958
01:58:09.041 --> 01:58:09.371
in the world.

4959
01:58:09.371 --> 01:58:10.210
I would love to test that.

4960
01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:11.083
That was the only thing.

4961
01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:13.100
<v 0>That was one of the things that Randy or we said that I,</v>

4962
01:58:13.190 --> 01:58:17.620
I found a very admirable that he would say that to his fighters when they were

4963
01:58:17.621 --> 01:58:18.550
going out to fight.

4964
01:58:18.551 --> 01:58:20.610
He would say even if you lose,

4965
01:58:20.630 --> 01:58:22.020
if you lose the worst thing in the world,

4966
01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:23.320
you lose and you'll be fine.

4967
01:58:23.321 --> 01:58:24.250
You still have your friends,

4968
01:58:24.251 --> 01:58:25.270
you still have your loved ones.

4969
01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:26.290
Get that out of your head.

4970
01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:27.190
Don't worry about that.

4971
01:58:27.191 --> 01:58:30.760
Don't worry about losing because sometimes if you concentrate on not losing,

4972
01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:32.590
you can't see what you're doing.

4973
01:58:33.290 --> 01:58:34.120
You can't relax.

4974
01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:35.110
<v 5>I say different.</v>

4975
01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:37.060
I say as long as you fight,

4976
01:58:37.330 --> 01:58:38.020
yes,

4977
01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:39.460
you cannot lose.

4978
01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:40.870
You go to Japan.

4979
01:58:40.871 --> 01:58:42.100
I like a Vernon

4980
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:42.731
<v 2>tiger white,</v>

4981
01:58:42.731 --> 01:58:46.190
one old boy lost a whole bunch fights in a row and it was a robot.

4982
01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:48.430
People waiting for him to get autographs and these people,

4983
01:58:48.431 --> 01:58:49.264
but he fought.

4984
01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:50.780
If you're under,

4985
01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:52.960
he's fan mentality is very different as well.

4986
01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:57.250
If you lay on the ground and somebody lifts his arm for granted potty you tab,

4987
01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:58.600
you'll never be back in Japan,

4988
01:58:58.630 --> 01:58:59.463
they'll boot you.

4989
01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:00.550
Then they got vicious,

4990
01:59:00.551 --> 01:59:01.260
you know,

4991
01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:02.440
and that's why I tell my students,

4992
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:03.430
as long as you fight,

4993
01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:04.180
you know,

4994
01:59:04.180 --> 01:59:05.710
if you leave everything out there,

4995
01:59:05.890 --> 01:59:06.191
you know,

4996
01:59:06.191 --> 01:59:07.570
it doesn't matter if you want to lose it,

4997
01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:08.020
you know,

4998
01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:09.430
to me you can never loose.

4999
01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:10.061
Well also,

5000
01:59:10.061 --> 01:59:10.894
you're always,

5001
01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:13.960
you're always involved in improving yourself.

5002
01:59:13.961 --> 01:59:15.250
You're a work in progress.

5003
01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:18.340
And until you find those great fighters who are better than you,

5004
01:59:18.490 --> 01:59:21.380
you don't realize what you need to work on that uh,

5005
01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:21.791
God,

5006
01:59:21.791 --> 01:59:23.050
you show me a guy who,

5007
01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:23.800
you know,

5008
01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:24.850
I forget who made this quote,

5009
01:59:24.851 --> 01:59:26.710
but I put it on Twitter the other day.

5010
01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:27.940
I retweeted it yesterday.

5011
01:59:28.150 --> 01:59:30.640
Show me someone who hasn't made mistakes and I'll show you someone who hasn't

5012
01:59:30.641 --> 01:59:31.270
done anything.

5013
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.770
Yeah.

5014
01:59:31.770 --> 01:59:32.620
And then that's,

5015
01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:33.101
it's true.

5016
01:59:33.101 --> 01:59:33.821
It's like you,

5017
01:59:33.821 --> 01:59:34.081
you,

5018
01:59:34.081 --> 01:59:34.360
you,

5019
01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:37.240
you have to get beat in order to really understand that at first of all,

5020
01:59:37.241 --> 01:59:40.090
how much it sucks to lose and that will motivate you more.

5021
01:59:40.330 --> 01:59:44.110
The guys that are always problematic or the guys who are super talented that win

5022
01:59:44.111 --> 01:59:44.561
easy,

5023
01:59:44.561 --> 01:59:45.790
that don't have to train hard.

5024
01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:48.410
And then some day someone catches up to them and they,

5025
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:50.110
and they lose if they lose.

5026
01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:51.000
It's always seminar.

5027
01:59:51.010 --> 01:59:51.843
You Watch,

5028
01:59:53.050 --> 01:59:54.520
they beat everybody into gym,

5029
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:55.720
dominate everybody.

5030
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:57.310
And once you fight on your own pace,

5031
01:59:57.311 --> 01:59:58.350
you never get tired.

5032
01:59:58.351 --> 01:59:59.800
You can fight for two hours.

5033
02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:04.300
But if you have that guy that push us and it stops your be interrupts your

5034
02:00:04.301 --> 02:00:04.880
breathing pattern.

5035
02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:05.770
That's what I always say.

5036
02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:06.431
You know,

5037
02:00:06.431 --> 02:00:07.450
that's the moment,

5038
02:00:07.451 --> 02:00:07.691
you know,

5039
02:00:07.691 --> 02:00:08.720
if somebody hits it back,

5040
02:00:08.721 --> 02:00:09.554
I'm standing behind him,

5041
02:00:09.580 --> 02:00:11.080
I'll kick him out of the blue to the body,

5042
02:00:12.070 --> 02:00:13.000
not to knock him out.

5043
02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:13.751
You know,

5044
02:00:13.751 --> 02:00:14.584
I had done that.

5045
02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:15.400
I do that.

5046
02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:18.610
So he has to flex at that particular moment and it interrupts his breathing

5047
02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:20.080
pattern and that's why you're getting tired,

5048
02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:20.640
you know?

5049
02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:21.520
I'm no kicking hard,

5050
02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:22.990
I'm just making him a bit,

5051
02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:23.310
oh,

5052
02:00:23.310 --> 02:00:24.143
does this.

5053
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:25.183
And I always tell her,

5054
02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:25.901
you know,

5055
02:00:25.901 --> 02:00:27.700
he interrupted it and that's how you get diarrhea.

5056
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:29.500
That's also the ratio with Nick Diaz.

5057
02:00:29.501 --> 02:00:29.801
Right?

5058
02:00:29.801 --> 02:00:30.880
With all his pat pat,

5059
02:00:30.881 --> 02:00:31.714
pat punches.

5060
02:00:31.870 --> 02:00:33.250
You never couldn't breathe.

5061
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:35.950
He never got a chance to take a break and relax.

5062
02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:36.230
Yeah.

5063
02:00:36.230 --> 02:00:38.710
He's this guy who just flies to everything.

5064
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:41.290
Now what do you think about that fight that's coming up this weekend?

5065
02:00:41.291 --> 02:00:43.030
Nick Diaz is fight and George St Pierre,

5066
02:00:43.210 --> 02:00:48.210
Johnny Hendricks is fight and Carlos condit and Jake Ellenberger is fighting a

5067
02:00:48.591 --> 02:00:49.424
Nate Marquardt,

5068
02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:51.580
assuming it's great fucking fights,

5069
02:00:51.581 --> 02:00:52.090
man.

5070
02:00:52.090 --> 02:00:53.530
That's going to be a really good show.

5071
02:00:53.531 --> 02:00:53.780
I,

5072
02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:55.210
it's a hard one.

5073
02:00:55.211 --> 02:00:57.730
You think if a GSP plays his game,

5074
02:00:57.731 --> 02:00:58.600
what do you normally does?

5075
02:00:58.601 --> 02:00:59.610
She's a really good restaurant.

5076
02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:00.790
We know he can take them down,

5077
02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:05.590
but the Nick Diaz to be underground,

5078
02:01:05.591 --> 02:01:07.120
he has to outwork him.

5079
02:01:07.210 --> 02:01:08.530
He needs to fight.

5080
02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:12.340
If he gets taken down to get back up and if he keeps fighting,

5081
02:01:12.341 --> 02:01:13.174
keeps fighting.

5082
02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:14.140
George gonna need a lot of,

5083
02:01:14.141 --> 02:01:14.441
spend,

5084
02:01:14.441 --> 02:01:15.021
a lot of energy,

5085
02:01:15.021 --> 02:01:16.630
you know it's going to be hometown for George.

5086
02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:17.950
A lot of pressure on his shoulders.

5087
02:01:17.951 --> 02:01:18.940
A lot of people don't want to.

5088
02:01:18.941 --> 02:01:19.540
Louis,

5089
02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:21.270
he knows so dead that he already,

5090
02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:22.900
that pressure may be already to care.

5091
02:01:22.901 --> 02:01:25.060
A little bit of a little bit of his stamina,

5092
02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:25.420
you know,

5093
02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:26.710
it took a little 20% of the way,

5094
02:01:26.711 --> 02:01:27.544
the motor pressure,

5095
02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:29.350
the more stamina get taken away from you.

5096
02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:29.891
You know,

5097
02:01:29.891 --> 02:01:30.880
he needs to be super,

5098
02:01:30.881 --> 02:01:34.600
super relaxed and if he doesn't let them to be super relax and constantly

5099
02:01:34.601 --> 02:01:35.200
escapes,

5100
02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:36.011
have fights,

5101
02:01:36.011 --> 02:01:37.750
the take down to fight back to get up,

5102
02:01:38.110 --> 02:01:38.441
you know,

5103
02:01:38.441 --> 02:01:40.670
then that might be a trouble for George.

5104
02:01:40.670 --> 02:01:44.180
But George was fighting last time because candid man,

5105
02:01:44.210 --> 02:01:45.620
I love that George.

5106
02:01:45.650 --> 02:01:45.960
That's,

5107
02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:47.420
that's the guy I want to see again,

5108
02:01:47.421 --> 02:01:51.500
a guy who he was working and he was working hard and that's what he needs to do

5109
02:01:51.501 --> 02:01:52.700
with Das,

5110
02:01:52.701 --> 02:01:54.290
but he needs to stay out of the garb.

5111
02:01:54.291 --> 02:01:54.831
Preferably,

5112
02:01:54.831 --> 02:01:55.910
I would say all have guards,

5113
02:01:55.911 --> 02:01:56.301
you know,

5114
02:01:56.301 --> 02:01:56.501
and,

5115
02:01:56.501 --> 02:01:57.281
and if you go into God,

5116
02:01:57.281 --> 02:01:57.510
whoa.

5117
02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:58.790
A squat,

5118
02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:00.050
don't let him close to guard.

5119
02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:04.020
That's going to be a problem for you constantly from half got squatted granum

5120
02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:04.893
pound,

5121
02:02:05.010 --> 02:02:05.360
uh,

5122
02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:07.010
playing the Jujitsu game on the ground.

5123
02:02:07.011 --> 02:02:09.140
I didn't know if it's a smart thing to do with the nick.

5124
02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:09.651
Yeah.

5125
02:02:09.651 --> 02:02:11.000
Nick has a hell of a guard.

5126
02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:11.720
New Southern.

5127
02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:13.250
The cyborg fight type.

5128
02:02:13.251 --> 02:02:13.561
Tap.

5129
02:02:13.561 --> 02:02:14.394
Cyborg.

5130
02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:16.700
The freaking collapsed on it.

5131
02:02:17.210 --> 02:02:17.480
Yeah,

5132
02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:18.320
the gummy fight.

5133
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:18.591
Yeah.

5134
02:02:18.591 --> 02:02:19.011
He's,

5135
02:02:19.011 --> 02:02:19.370
uh,

5136
02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:21.080
he's very underrated I think.

5137
02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:22.170
I think he's got a,

5138
02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:26.840
he's got a lot of Brazilian jujitsu skills that we rarely see because over the

5139
02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:29.030
past couple of years he's been beaten guys up on the feet.

5140
02:02:29.630 --> 02:02:30.350
That's it.

5141
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:30.861
And a,

5142
02:02:30.861 --> 02:02:31.221
and let,

5143
02:02:31.221 --> 02:02:33.140
now George has to overcome that,

5144
02:02:33.141 --> 02:02:34.310
reach that Longhand,

5145
02:02:34.370 --> 02:02:35.270
constantly peppering,

5146
02:02:35.271 --> 02:02:35.930
peppering them.

5147
02:02:35.930 --> 02:02:37.760
But I think he will shoot straight through it.

5148
02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:38.980
I think so,

5149
02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:39.290
yeah.

5150
02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:40.400
I think that Nate,

5151
02:02:40.401 --> 02:02:42.320
maybe if he would work really hard on any,

5152
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:47.470
sorry nick and need to deface so on a take down because I think the take down

5153
02:02:48.411 --> 02:02:51.440
will be there anyway because he's such a good restaurant,

5154
02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:52.050
you know,

5155
02:02:52.050 --> 02:02:53.180
it's going to be hard to stop him.

5156
02:02:53.181 --> 02:02:54.590
But Kenny still stop him in the,

5157
02:02:54.591 --> 02:02:55.690
in the championship rounds.

5158
02:02:55.720 --> 02:02:56.421
If it goes in there,

5159
02:02:56.421 --> 02:02:56.810
you know.

5160
02:02:56.810 --> 02:02:56.981
Well,

5161
02:02:56.981 --> 02:02:58.160
and the question's gonna be,

5162
02:02:58.170 --> 02:02:58.501
well,

5163
02:02:58.501 --> 02:02:58.710
we'll,

5164
02:02:58.710 --> 02:03:01.640
is he going to try to stop him or is he going to try to pull guard?

5165
02:03:01.641 --> 02:03:05.030
Is he going to try to roll with it and just lock up a good position right away

5166
02:03:05.031 --> 02:03:06.590
like he did with Gomi or you know,

5167
02:03:06.591 --> 02:03:07.880
like he did with Cyborg.

5168
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.480
He has a very nasty garden mean Nick Diaz is a high level black belt.

5169
02:03:11.570 --> 02:03:12.050
Yup.

5170
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:13.970
And that fucking stamina,

5171
02:03:13.971 --> 02:03:14.271
man,

5172
02:03:14.271 --> 02:03:15.190
that's a big deal to,

5173
02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:15.981
that's the thing,

5174
02:03:15.981 --> 02:03:16.281
you know,

5175
02:03:16.281 --> 02:03:17.840
if you fight a guy like that,

5176
02:03:18.050 --> 02:03:18.531
you know,

5177
02:03:18.531 --> 02:03:19.280
um,

5178
02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:19.521
what,

5179
02:03:19.521 --> 02:03:20.181
what did they say?

5180
02:03:20.181 --> 02:03:22.860
They make scout with stem or fatigue makes cowards out of man.

5181
02:03:22.890 --> 02:03:24.020
And it really is real.

5182
02:03:24.021 --> 02:03:24.800
Been there,

5183
02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:25.191
you know,

5184
02:03:25.191 --> 02:03:26.360
that you're really tired.

5185
02:03:26.660 --> 02:03:27.980
I had it in a fight and I go,

5186
02:03:27.981 --> 02:03:28.491
oh my God,

5187
02:03:28.491 --> 02:03:29.140
I hope I did.

5188
02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:31.670
Thankfully I knocked him out with the needs of the liver,

5189
02:03:31.970 --> 02:03:32.271
but,

5190
02:03:32.271 --> 02:03:32.600
uh,

5191
02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:33.170
I was,

5192
02:03:33.170 --> 02:03:34.940
I was really about to stop almost,

5193
02:03:34.941 --> 02:03:35.281
you know,

5194
02:03:35.281 --> 02:03:35.581
and you,

5195
02:03:35.581 --> 02:03:37.070
you everything syncs away.

5196
02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:37.730
You know,

5197
02:03:37.730 --> 02:03:38.690
I was sick also,

5198
02:03:38.691 --> 02:03:42.410
but I mean it starts with seminar and fatigued and then when you see him still

5199
02:03:42.411 --> 02:03:44.630
going strong at some mental crusher man.

5200
02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:45.711
And uh,

5201
02:03:45.711 --> 02:03:48.230
and that's the thing that GSP now has.

5202
02:03:48.230 --> 02:03:50.750
He knows that whatever happens,

5203
02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:52.500
it's not going to run it against it.

5204
02:03:53.190 --> 02:03:54.140
Nick's not going to run against.

5205
02:03:54.141 --> 02:03:54.830
But you know what,

5206
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:56.150
George has always been very,

5207
02:03:56.151 --> 02:03:57.980
very good condition as well,

5208
02:03:58.220 --> 02:03:58.611
you know?

5209
02:03:58.611 --> 02:03:59.090
Um,

5210
02:03:59.090 --> 02:03:59.331
it's,

5211
02:03:59.331 --> 02:04:01.820
it's interesting how many fighters get sick before fights.

5212
02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:03.350
It's a huge issue.

5213
02:04:03.410 --> 02:04:05.300
I always had it with the taekwondo days.

5214
02:04:05.301 --> 02:04:06.680
I'd get sick from the nerves,

5215
02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:09.240
but I think also a lot is the cutting weight.

5216
02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:10.313
Yes.

5217
02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:14.660
But it was also just hard training and not watching their diet.

5218
02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:15.591
And I never,

5219
02:04:15.591 --> 02:04:16.221
I never had that.

5220
02:04:16.221 --> 02:04:17.690
I brought my own food.

5221
02:04:17.930 --> 02:04:20.240
I brought my own loaf of bread and all that stuff.

5222
02:04:20.241 --> 02:04:21.740
I was not going to get food poisoning.

5223
02:04:21.741 --> 02:04:22.371
Forget about it.

5224
02:04:22.371 --> 02:04:23.330
I brought my own water.

5225
02:04:23.570 --> 02:04:23.781
You know,

5226
02:04:23.781 --> 02:04:25.280
you heard all these stories in Japan.

5227
02:04:25.290 --> 02:04:25.541
They say,

5228
02:04:25.541 --> 02:04:25.710
well,

5229
02:04:25.710 --> 02:04:26.570
something in your water.

5230
02:04:26.571 --> 02:04:28.700
I didn't want to take a risk of whether it's true or a myth or not.

5231
02:04:28.701 --> 02:04:29.534
I don't care.

5232
02:04:29.690 --> 02:04:30.620
I bring my own water,

5233
02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:31.670
nobody's going to touch it,

5234
02:04:31.671 --> 02:04:32.061
you know?

5235
02:04:32.061 --> 02:04:32.271
And,

5236
02:04:32.271 --> 02:04:32.960
uh,

5237
02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:34.940
at least I could have the dumbass thing.

5238
02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:37.760
And those are guys who go to day before,

5239
02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:38.130
go to

5240
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:39.740
<v 5>a Mcdonald's Sushi place somewhere,</v>

5241
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:40.260
you know,

5242
02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:42.180
and they're gonna eat like bad Sushi.

5243
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.661
And they go,

5244
02:04:42.661 --> 02:04:42.891
yeah,

5245
02:04:42.891 --> 02:04:43.710
it's food poisoning.

5246
02:04:43.710 --> 02:04:44.543
You're an idiot.

5247
02:04:44.650 --> 02:04:46.200
That's part of your training.

5248
02:04:46.230 --> 02:04:47.670
You should not have done that.

5249
02:04:47.970 --> 02:04:48.870
Why take that risk?

5250
02:04:48.871 --> 02:04:49.240
Yeah.

5251
02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:50.310
It's the dumbest thing you can do.

5252
02:04:50.311 --> 02:04:52.110
It's like the guys were the mouthpiece,

5253
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.801
you know?

5254
02:04:52.801 --> 02:04:55.190
But when I saw Karl appreciate five with the mouthpiece,

5255
02:04:55.191 --> 02:04:56.220
I fell out the whole time,

5256
02:04:56.221 --> 02:04:56.610
you know,

5257
02:04:56.610 --> 02:04:57.421
that drives me nuts.

5258
02:04:57.421 --> 02:04:58.830
That should be a penalty for that.

5259
02:04:59.340 --> 02:04:59.731
You know,

5260
02:04:59.731 --> 02:05:00.910
constantly fallout.

5261
02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:02.090
Like who does that?

5262
02:05:02.110 --> 02:05:03.240
You're a professional fighter.

5263
02:05:03.241 --> 02:05:04.410
You need a good mouthpiece,

5264
02:05:04.411 --> 02:05:04.570
right?

5265
02:05:04.570 --> 02:05:05.100
Yeah,

5266
02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:05.820
yeah.

5267
02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:06.250
Do you,

5268
02:05:06.250 --> 02:05:08.490
are you still training fighters on a regular basis?

5269
02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:08.791
You know,

5270
02:05:08.791 --> 02:05:13.170
it's hard now because I have that neck surgery and uh,

5271
02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:15.990
last week I did two sets of pushups.

5272
02:05:16.170 --> 02:05:16.470
Uh,

5273
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:21.470
18 imagine I did the 124 fun begging the day and uh,

5274
02:05:22.230 --> 02:05:22.531
so,

5275
02:05:22.531 --> 02:05:23.101
and I was like,

5276
02:05:23.101 --> 02:05:23.761
Oh my God,

5277
02:05:23.761 --> 02:05:24.660
I'm so weak.

5278
02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:27.300
And then after two days I lost all power.

5279
02:05:27.301 --> 02:05:31.230
So I know there is something that when it swells up or the flares up,

5280
02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:33.120
it stops my nurse from getting in a day.

5281
02:05:33.330 --> 02:05:34.710
Tomorrow I'm going to find out two more,

5282
02:05:34.711 --> 02:05:37.110
10 45 in the morning going to find out they didn't have the nerve conduction

5283
02:05:37.111 --> 02:05:38.730
test where that marketers,

5284
02:05:38.850 --> 02:05:40.740
and I think once they can open that up,

5285
02:05:41.370 --> 02:05:43.770
then everything's going to be just so you're going to have to have another

5286
02:05:43.771 --> 02:05:44.520
operation.

5287
02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:45.241
I don't know,

5288
02:05:45.241 --> 02:05:46.021
maybe they say,

5289
02:05:46.021 --> 02:05:46.221
oh,

5290
02:05:46.221 --> 02:05:50.450
well it's rest or this or maybe they do an epidural there right on the spot that

5291
02:05:50.451 --> 02:05:51.300
will loosen it up,

5292
02:05:51.340 --> 02:05:52.171
something like that.

5293
02:05:52.171 --> 02:05:52.411
But,

5294
02:05:52.411 --> 02:05:53.010
uh,

5295
02:05:53.010 --> 02:05:55.830
my nerve in my neck jumped from under low 30%.

5296
02:05:55.831 --> 02:05:57.120
He said when we opened your neck,

5297
02:05:57.150 --> 02:05:57.983
a jumped back,

5298
02:05:58.050 --> 02:06:01.560
same level of shadow 100 was been dealing with this for years,

5299
02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:02.310
years now.

5300
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:03.150
It's a nightmare.

5301
02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:03.631
But you know,

5302
02:06:03.631 --> 02:06:05.290
I used to be a crazy guy training I,

5303
02:06:05.291 --> 02:06:06.600
I scan of my own stuff,

5304
02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:07.351
you know,

5305
02:06:07.351 --> 02:06:09.330
because I was talking to people,

5306
02:06:09.331 --> 02:06:10.650
a world champions,

5307
02:06:10.651 --> 02:06:11.484
and it would teach,

5308
02:06:11.580 --> 02:06:12.413
what did they say?

5309
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:14.580
They go hard on Fridays,

5310
02:06:14.610 --> 02:06:17.790
70% and I go,

5311
02:06:17.860 --> 02:06:19.740
and what do you do for the rest of what we train?

5312
02:06:19.770 --> 02:06:20.280
I said,

5313
02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:21.780
you're spar one day a week.

5314
02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:22.621
Yeah.

5315
02:06:22.621 --> 02:06:23.460
And I started laughing.

5316
02:06:23.461 --> 02:06:23.810
I said,

5317
02:06:23.810 --> 02:06:26.340
but I say I sparked two times a day.

5318
02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:28.050
W W we go heart,

5319
02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:31.140
I'll try to knock your idea legs or your buddy or you do it to me.

5320
02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:31.981
And on the hat,

5321
02:06:31.981 --> 02:06:33.450
of course I'm not going to knock him out,

5322
02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:34.500
but I got guys,

5323
02:06:34.501 --> 02:06:35.340
I've got to control for that.

5324
02:06:35.610 --> 02:06:36.240
But we go,

5325
02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:37.073
we go.

5326
02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:37.291
Right.

5327
02:06:37.291 --> 02:06:37.710
You know,

5328
02:06:37.710 --> 02:06:38.160
I,

5329
02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:41.250
that's why I never had a ring rust when I came back in 2006.

5330
02:06:41.251 --> 02:06:41.760
You know,

5331
02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:43.500
I didn't fight for six years,

5332
02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:47.670
but I had no problem because two times a day we have a fight.

5333
02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:48.780
That's what we're doing.

5334
02:06:48.781 --> 02:06:49.860
So I felt great.

5335
02:06:50.140 --> 02:06:52.560
Then what about the wear and tear though from doing that?

5336
02:06:52.590 --> 02:06:53.423
That's the thing.

5337
02:06:54.060 --> 02:06:54.893
That's the thing,

5338
02:06:55.570 --> 02:06:56.403
uh,

5339
02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:00.900
advice to every fighter now is to always get the right equipment,

5340
02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:04.380
make sure you're packed him and make sure your ankles or tape,

5341
02:07:04.381 --> 02:07:05.214
things like that.

5342
02:07:05.310 --> 02:07:08.250
Because with the Shin protection now they got really good Shin protection that

5343
02:07:08.251 --> 02:07:09.084
has also,

5344
02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:10.170
you know what the instep,

5345
02:07:10.450 --> 02:07:11.670
they have protection there now,

5346
02:07:11.671 --> 02:07:11.941
you know,

5347
02:07:11.941 --> 02:07:13.320
so that cannot be hurt.

5348
02:07:13.321 --> 02:07:14.370
Like when you kick an elbow.

5349
02:07:14.371 --> 02:07:14.760
Right.

5350
02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:16.530
And those are bad injuries the whole time.

5351
02:07:16.531 --> 02:07:17.190
You know,

5352
02:07:17.190 --> 02:07:17.791
watch out.

5353
02:07:17.791 --> 02:07:20.880
Just just back yourself and make a good mouthpiece.

5354
02:07:20.881 --> 02:07:22.770
Get a professional mouthpiece done.

5355
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:23.000
Right.

5356
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.960
It's a put grease on your way down.

5357
02:07:24.961 --> 02:07:25.794
Watch for cuts.

5358
02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:27.240
I play everything safe.

5359
02:07:27.450 --> 02:07:28.920
Now when you have God's training though,

5360
02:07:28.921 --> 02:07:31.440
do you have them spa that same way twice a day,

5361
02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:32.250
you know,

5362
02:07:32.250 --> 02:07:33.083
going all out.

5363
02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:36.090
We have people coming in us and it went as

5364
02:07:36.090 --> 02:07:40.360
<v 2>far on Sundays and they turned around when they seem spar they go like,</v>

5365
02:07:40.361 --> 02:07:40.750
but that's,

5366
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:44.640
that started since Carlo Rommel deck cause his brother came to teach at my gym.

5367
02:07:44.710 --> 02:07:47.120
He says now we're going to support like we do in Holland and now that's,

5368
02:07:47.150 --> 02:07:48.310
that's the way we used to do it.

5369
02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:50.440
And they go hard and got going on down.

5370
02:07:50.441 --> 02:07:51.200
Yeah.

5371
02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:51.820
All the,

5372
02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:53.650
all the guys are guys are already used to it.

5373
02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:54.200
Wow.

5374
02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:55.000
They just don't care.

5375
02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:55.833
They just go.

5376
02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:56.231
But,

5377
02:07:56.231 --> 02:07:57.460
but to get the right equipment,

5378
02:07:57.461 --> 02:07:59.190
as long as you have the right equipment that you don't get me.

5379
02:07:59.250 --> 02:07:59.380
No.

5380

02:08:40.481 --> 02:08:41.410
I didn't even ask him.

5413
02:08:41.411 --> 02:08:41.771
I told him,

5414
02:08:41.771 --> 02:08:42.050

5417
02:08:46.811 --> 02:08:47.261
We're like,

5418
02:08:47.261 --> 02:08:48.094

5419
02:08:48.490 --> 02:08:48.880

5420
02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:51.140

5421
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.870
Crazy.

5422
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:53.290
He had a heart attack riding a bike.

5423
02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:53.501
I mean,

5424
02:08:53.501 --> 02:08:55.750
thinking about all the fights that guy had and also,

5425
02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:56.021
you know,

5426
02:08:56.021 --> 02:08:56.340
yeah,

5427
02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:58.210
we're talking about two or the 45 days or something.

5428
02:08:58.210 --> 02:08:59.043
You know,

5429
02:08:59.210 --> 02:08:59.921
this guy,

5430
02:08:59.921 --> 02:09:03.490
it's fighting with a broken hand and the broken foot at the same time.

5431
02:09:03.491 --> 02:09:04.301
And it would keep fighting,

5432
02:09:04.301 --> 02:09:04.511
you know,

5433
02:09:04.511 --> 02:09:07.210
the guy was just in and also living at clean,

5434
02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:10.270
healthy lifestyle now for the last six years or so.

5435
02:09:10.271 --> 02:09:10.661
You know,

5436
02:09:10.661 --> 02:09:10.901
like,

5437
02:09:10.901 --> 02:09:11.560
uh,

5438
02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:12.460
being in shape,

5439
02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:14.320
you don't have everything planned out.

5440
02:09:14.321 --> 02:09:18.070
He has this child for children's foundation that he set up in Thailand for these

5441
02:09:18.071 --> 02:09:18.641
kids who,

5442
02:09:18.641 --> 02:09:18.951
you know,

5443
02:09:18.951 --> 02:09:23.110
who had no future and he would give them money and all that stuff is now,

5444
02:09:23.230 --> 02:09:23.501
you know,

5445
02:09:23.501 --> 02:09:26.730
still going to happen to us now t shirts coming and may bloodlines is going to

5446
02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:30.130
make a t shirt 100% goes to the family or to the charity.

5447
02:09:30.131 --> 02:09:33.190
So they're working on a lot of things to keep his name out there.

5448
02:09:33.191 --> 02:09:35.750
Of course it's fucked up.

5449
02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:39.370
I can just be that great a fighter and athlete and just have a heart attack at

5450
02:09:39.371 --> 02:09:40.870
43 and just dropped dead.

5451
02:09:41.230 --> 02:09:42.430
It's a wireless thing ever.

5452
02:09:42.431 --> 02:09:42.851
You know,

5453
02:09:42.851 --> 02:09:43.480
I uh,

5454
02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:44.200
since uh,

5455
02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:45.160
he passed away.

5456
02:09:45.190 --> 02:09:47.200
I drank one and a half glass of wine.

5457
02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:50.680
[inaudible] normally I drink two classes at night or to draw,

5458
02:09:50.681 --> 02:09:52.610
maybe I right away I go,

5459
02:09:52.611 --> 02:09:53.290
oh my God,

5460
02:09:53.290 --> 02:09:54.490
this is really scary.

5461
02:09:54.491 --> 02:09:55.480
He was healthy.

5462
02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:56.501
He was good.

5463
02:09:56.501 --> 02:09:58.480
There was nothing in his family who,

5464
02:09:58.481 --> 02:09:58.751
you know,

5465
02:09:58.751 --> 02:09:59.411
bad hearts,

5466
02:09:59.411 --> 02:10:01.240
nothing just out of the blue.

5467
02:10:01.241 --> 02:10:01.601
So,

5468
02:10:01.601 --> 02:10:01.811
uh,

5469
02:10:01.811 --> 02:10:02.980
that really freaked me out.

5470
02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:03.370
Yeah.

5471
02:10:03.370 --> 02:10:06.160
Well it's gotta be freaking you out with all this nerve shit going on with your

5472
02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:06.760
bonding.

5473
02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:07.151
Yeah.

5474
02:10:07.151 --> 02:10:08.200
Once his comes back,

5475
02:10:08.230 --> 02:10:08.530
you know,

5476
02:10:08.530 --> 02:10:08.881
I,

5477
02:10:08.881 --> 02:10:11.080
I've been always blessed with all the kind of stuff.

5478
02:10:11.081 --> 02:10:11.570
I grew up,

5479
02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:11.790
it,

5480
02:10:11.790 --> 02:10:12.910
it heals fast.

5481
02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:14.560
And I think it comes because of my,

5482
02:10:14.590 --> 02:10:14.760
my,

5483
02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:15.010
my,

5484
02:10:15.010 --> 02:10:15.281
my,

5485
02:10:15.281 --> 02:10:15.970
uh,

5486
02:10:15.970 --> 02:10:17.890
Eczema that I had really bad asthma.

5487
02:10:17.891 --> 02:10:19.690
So I was recouping fast by like my,

5488
02:10:19.930 --> 02:10:21.280
if I had one said training,

5489
02:10:21.550 --> 02:10:23.670
like a wound that would be literally today,

5490
02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:24.730
she couldn't tell her what it was.

5491
02:10:24.730 --> 02:10:28.540
There we go so fast because that was what my skin was doing 24,

5492
02:10:28.541 --> 02:10:28.931
seven,

5493
02:10:28.931 --> 02:10:29.291
you know,

5494
02:10:29.291 --> 02:10:30.580
so now it's,

5495
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:32.260
I'm blessed with having that,

5496
02:10:32.290 --> 02:10:33.123
but my neck,

5497
02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:33.950
that's annoying.

5498
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:34.940
That doesn't really,

5499
02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:35.271
you know,

5500
02:10:35.271 --> 02:10:36.350
spike those blockages.

5501
02:10:36.351 --> 02:10:36.831
It's here.

5502
02:10:36.831 --> 02:10:37.431
I can feel it.

5503
02:10:37.431 --> 02:10:37.661
It's,

5504
02:10:37.661 --> 02:10:38.494
it's the lumps.

5505
02:10:38.570 --> 02:10:39.620
And what is a blockage?

5506
02:10:39.621 --> 02:10:42.580
Is it scar tissue and muscle spasms?

5507
02:10:42.590 --> 02:10:43.260
What they say?

5508
02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:45.650
What stops the nerves from getting in my arm?

5509
02:10:45.651 --> 02:10:46.251
And that's why I look,

5510
02:10:46.251 --> 02:10:47.084
it's all thin.

5511
02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:50.330
It doesn't fill up yet yet.

5512
02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:52.040
It will start happening.

5513
02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:54.470
And they said because of what you've done by,

5514
02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:55.760
by fusing the neck,

5515
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:56.511
it's alleviated.

5516
02:10:56.511 --> 02:10:59.960
Some of the pressure is I jumped back right away to 100% this is what they said.

5517
02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:02.180
So curbing to me.

5518
02:11:02.181 --> 02:11:03.740
How many people have back issues?

5519
02:11:03.741 --> 02:11:05.450
I mean it's so disturbing.

5520
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:08.180
There's so many guys were fucked up backs.

5521
02:11:08.181 --> 02:11:09.020
It's really crazy,

5522
02:11:09.021 --> 02:11:09.380
man.

5523
02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:10.700
My Shit's fucked up right now.

5524
02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:13.400
But it's just because I got three myths sizes in one day,

5525
02:11:13.401 --> 02:11:14.690
which never do that ever.

5526
02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:16.780
Well that's a sore.

5527
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:17.301
You just,

5528
02:11:17.301 --> 02:11:18.560
you're talking about muscles,

5529
02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:19.311
you know the,

5530
02:11:19.311 --> 02:11:19.431
the,

5531
02:11:19.431 --> 02:11:23.360
the issue that these fighters are having is a lot different than you pal.

5532
02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:24.200
Yeah.

5533
02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:24.950
The um,

5534
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:27.950
the wear and tear on the body's just fucking unbelievable.

5535
02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:28.580
It's brutal.

5536
02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:29.413
You look at it,

5537
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:31.710
no time to recoup all show.

5538
02:11:32.270 --> 02:11:32.810
You know,

5539
02:11:32.810 --> 02:11:33.441
I had,

5540
02:11:33.441 --> 02:11:35.450
when I was preparing for that last fight,

5541
02:11:35.930 --> 02:11:37.220
I had two times a week off.

5542
02:11:37.221 --> 02:11:39.890
I had only 10 weeks for that fight.

5543
02:11:39.891 --> 02:11:41.330
I didn't train for three years.

5544
02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:45.230
So I have 10 weeks to get a shape and two weeks from that I didn't,

5545
02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:47.720
he didn't train at all for three years.

5546
02:11:48.230 --> 02:11:48.650
No,

5547
02:11:48.650 --> 02:11:49.150
not at all.

5548
02:11:49.150 --> 02:11:49.321
I,

5549
02:11:49.321 --> 02:11:49.510
I,

5550
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:50.690
since my last fight,

5551
02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:53.780
I think I worked out maybe 25 times.

5552
02:11:53.781 --> 02:11:55.910
That's in 2006 wow.

5553
02:11:55.940 --> 02:11:56.300
Yeah,

5554
02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:59.210
that's mad that that will be at the end because I started finally I started

5555
02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:00.650
training again and then my God,

5556
02:12:00.651 --> 02:12:01.400
I feel really good.

5557
02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:02.840
Like if four weeks I was actually,

5558
02:12:03.110 --> 02:12:06.500
people always think that I just say something and that it's not too,

5559
02:12:06.501 --> 02:12:07.540
I say the boss,

5560
02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:08.510
the body actually system,

5561
02:12:08.511 --> 02:12:09.440
I use that myself,

5562
02:12:09.650 --> 02:12:10.281
the o two trade,

5563
02:12:10.281 --> 02:12:12.260
I use it myself to workout shoes myself and they go,

5564
02:12:12.261 --> 02:12:12.830
yeah,

5565
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:13.611
you're just saying that.

5566
02:12:13.611 --> 02:12:13.851
I go,

5567
02:12:13.851 --> 02:12:14.684
wait a minute,

5568
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:19.520
I can go back on my security camera and you can actually see me training in the

5569
02:12:19.521 --> 02:12:19.880
backyard.

5570
02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:23.670
So I went back on a security camera and I got it for a month back and I was

5571
02:12:23.671 --> 02:12:25.910
trading only for five fixed and at the beginning you see me,

5572
02:12:26.450 --> 02:12:27.770
I'm struggling man.

5573
02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:28.790
I'd like two minute vine.

5574
02:12:28.791 --> 02:12:29.624
It's really bad.

5575
02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:31.220
But the amazing,

5576
02:12:31.221 --> 02:12:33.740
if you see like several workouts further,

5577
02:12:34.070 --> 02:12:35.240
it's a whole different,

5578
02:12:35.241 --> 02:12:39.230
suddenly the screen for the auto trader and went from three til seven which is a

5579
02:12:39.231 --> 02:12:41.690
heavy setting already at 10 pound ankle weights,

5580
02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:42.800
heavy gloves.

5581
02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:45.580
I put weights in there also hitting and then one day,

5582
02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:46.171
yeah.

5583
02:12:46.171 --> 02:12:46.521
Yeah,

5584
02:12:46.521 --> 02:12:48.380
but I watch out with our hyper extending.

5585
02:12:48.381 --> 02:12:49.370
Then when I do that,

5586
02:12:49.610 --> 02:12:49.821
you know,

5587
02:12:49.821 --> 02:12:54.260
or I hit that boss thing so you don't don't hyper extend but it's good for the

5588
02:12:54.261 --> 02:12:55.240
burn and for everything.

5589
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:57.340
You get tired and then I,

5590
02:12:57.380 --> 02:12:58.940
I threw one time in the air,

5591
02:12:58.941 --> 02:13:03.941
something I think I maybe I hyper extended and the West just for one day to get

5592
02:13:04.011 --> 02:13:06.230
out of my head dropped and I go,

5593
02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:06.891
Oh God,

5594
02:13:06.891 --> 02:13:08.450
it's back and it was it.

5595
02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:13.370
That was in October and then they did the surgery in the January but we're

5596
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:14.960
getting yourself back in shape.

5597
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:18.260
I was and it was good and really well I start feeling great already.

5598
02:13:18.261 --> 02:13:18.911
I mean you,

5599
02:13:18.911 --> 02:13:19.401
you watch,

5600
02:13:19.401 --> 02:13:19.911
it's online.

5601
02:13:19.911 --> 02:13:24.590
It's on the Ode to train in the O two trainer blog.com you can find the video

5602
02:13:24.591 --> 02:13:25.700
there and your neck.

5603
02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:28.850
When the first operation they didn't fuse the discs would they do,

5604
02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:30.830
they made the holes around the nerves a little,

5605
02:13:31.570 --> 02:13:32.350
but it was still

5606
02:13:32.350 --> 02:13:34.960
<v 4>a little squeezing so it was only a 30% working in.</v>

5607
02:13:34.961 --> 02:13:36.550
I knew that because herniated discs,

5608
02:13:36.610 --> 02:13:37.443
is that what it was?

5609
02:13:37.870 --> 02:13:41.080
But they only worked like 30% or a little bit less and I knew that because I

5610
02:13:41.081 --> 02:13:42.850
could like with with 10 pounds,

5611
02:13:42.851 --> 02:13:44.440
he did like 25 reps.

5612
02:13:44.570 --> 02:13:47.170
Still very weak because I used to do way more with that.

5613
02:13:47.171 --> 02:13:48.250
But that makes sense.

5614
02:13:48.251 --> 02:13:51.130
With the 25 of the 30% I go okay.

5615
02:13:51.490 --> 02:13:52.930
But then when it happened in the training,

5616
02:13:52.931 --> 02:13:54.220
I think something disk,

5617
02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:56.740
that's when the the judge jam habit here.

5618
02:13:56.770 --> 02:13:58.740
Now knowing what you know and are all

5619
02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:00.330
<v 0>this experience that you have,</v>

5620
02:14:00.331 --> 02:14:03.120
especially all this experience where your body like breaking down,

5621
02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:03.540
what,

5622
02:14:03.540 --> 02:14:05.370
what do you tell finders to do now?

5623
02:14:05.371 --> 02:14:05.701
I mean do you,

5624
02:14:05.701 --> 02:14:06.061
what do you,

5625
02:14:06.061 --> 02:14:07.380
what do you advise them?

5626
02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:09.600
How do you not do what you did?

5627
02:14:09.630 --> 02:14:10.460
That was wrong.

5628
02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:11.120
<v 4>Stretch,</v>

5629
02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:11.841
stretch man.

5630
02:14:11.841 --> 02:14:12.710
Stretch a lot.

5631
02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:13.760
I would stretch.

5632
02:14:13.761 --> 02:14:15.740
I will make that one of my primary things,

5633
02:14:15.980 --> 02:14:16.311
you know,

5634
02:14:16.311 --> 02:14:17.150
watching TV,

5635
02:14:17.151 --> 02:14:18.650
just stretch while you're watching TV,

5636
02:14:18.651 --> 02:14:19.570
get to stretch bands,

5637
02:14:19.571 --> 02:14:20.404
do you know?

5638
02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:20.930
Yeah.

5639
02:14:20.930 --> 02:14:21.890
While you're watching TV,

5640
02:14:21.891 --> 02:14:24.270
you're busy with it doesn't really matter and,

5641
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:27.500
and good food don't dehydrate yourself or why she started the hydrating

5642
02:14:27.501 --> 02:14:28.280
yourself.

5643
02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:30.620
Stretch even more men because that's where you,

5644
02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:32.040
your tendons get dehydrated.

5645
02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:34.650
Everything there they ripped faster than she is.

5646
02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:36.740
See a lot of that also happened close to a fight.

5647
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:39.500
They study hydrating and to make it kick and they pull a hamstring,

5648
02:14:39.501 --> 02:14:39.880
you know,

5649
02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:41.480
that's exactly because of that reason.

5650
02:14:41.481 --> 02:14:42.740
You're dehydrating yourself.

5651
02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:44.360
Those tenants need to stay moist,

5652
02:14:44.361 --> 02:14:44.780
you know,

5653
02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:45.613
make,

5654
02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:47.630
keep it good and watch out.

5655
02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:49.340
And as far as

5656
02:14:49.340 --> 02:14:49.641
<v 0>like,</v>

5657
02:14:49.641 --> 02:14:52.450
what kind of therapy that you're doing right now for,

5658
02:14:52.451 --> 02:14:52.911
for your,

5659
02:14:52.911 --> 02:14:53.601
for your back,

5660
02:14:53.601 --> 02:14:57.290
do you do any inversion therapy or any,

5661
02:14:57.291 --> 02:14:57.860
uh,

5662
02:14:57.860 --> 02:14:58.560
nothing?

5663
02:14:58.560 --> 02:14:59.131
Were there,

5664
02:14:59.131 --> 02:14:59.964
uh,

5665
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:02.000
trying to do any sort of traction?

5666
02:15:02.370 --> 02:15:02.641
<v 4>No.</v>

5667
02:15:02.641 --> 02:15:02.770
I,

5668
02:15:02.770 --> 02:15:02.970
I,

5669
02:15:02.970 --> 02:15:03.421
what I do,

5670
02:15:03.421 --> 02:15:05.430
I have to two to a hook,

5671
02:15:05.431 --> 02:15:06.010
so to say,

5672
02:15:06.010 --> 02:15:11.010
well in my hand and I have to understand to go to the second floor with this,

5673
02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:11.730
uh,

5674
02:15:11.730 --> 02:15:12.230
hang,

5675
02:15:12.230 --> 02:15:12.950
hang.

5676
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:16.530
I just hang in a stretch my arms out and that seems to help.

5677
02:15:16.531 --> 02:15:18.810
Like last week I could do three,

5678
02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:19.950
uh,

5679
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:20.910
uh,

5680
02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:22.140
with five pounds,

5681
02:15:22.170 --> 02:15:22.980
three reps,

5682
02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:23.730
five pounds.

5683
02:15:23.730 --> 02:15:24.470
Wow.

5684
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.990
And,

5685
02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:28.500
and then I started stretching and I start mentally focusing.

5686
02:15:28.501 --> 02:15:32.970
Somebody told me just force it to be gone and the official,

5687
02:15:32.971 --> 02:15:34.860
I visualize how you could get rid of it.

5688
02:15:34.990 --> 02:15:38.100
And I started doing that and then yesterday evening at a 10,

5689
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:38.821
so,

5690
02:15:38.821 --> 02:15:39.830
and that was just in,

5691
02:15:39.831 --> 02:15:40.560
in four days.

5692
02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:41.700
But I've been also hanging.

5693
02:15:41.970 --> 02:15:45.320
How many of the guys you run into then have these issues get lots.

5694
02:15:45.390 --> 02:15:49.530
A lot of guys have the Benji radic Tito Ortiz issue as well.

5695
02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:50.050
Yeah.

5696
02:15:50.050 --> 02:15:50.301
Yeah.

5697
02:15:50.301 --> 02:15:51.610
The big nick also lost,

5698
02:15:51.611 --> 02:15:53.130
stuck or lost everything.

5699
02:15:53.131 --> 02:15:54.430
He lost this pack.

5700
02:15:54.431 --> 02:15:56.850
So I believe that's a c seven or eight or something.

5701
02:15:56.970 --> 02:15:57.541
I think I'd,

5702
02:15:57.541 --> 02:15:57.831
I,

5703
02:15:57.831 --> 02:16:00.120
I dunno how did it at sex works with me.

5704
02:16:00.121 --> 02:16:01.800
It's a biceps,

5705
02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:02.971
biceps,

5706
02:16:02.971 --> 02:16:03.301
the shoulder,

5707
02:16:03.301 --> 02:16:05.250
my shoulder starts coming back now because that there,

5708
02:16:05.251 --> 02:16:05.941
of course over here,

5709
02:16:05.941 --> 02:16:06.480
over the top.

5710
02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:07.313
That's good start.

5711
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:09.210
I see the muscle started getting there,

5712
02:16:09.211 --> 02:16:10.044
so that's good.

5713
02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:12.780
But the for the biceps and I get this,

5714
02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:13.620
uh,

5715
02:16:13.620 --> 02:16:17.730
carpal tunnel that I already had but never was a problem with me.

5716
02:16:17.731 --> 02:16:18.930
But now because the nerve,

5717
02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:19.793
it is a problem.

5718
02:16:19.980 --> 02:16:20.731
So now I can't,

5719
02:16:20.731 --> 02:16:23.190
if I grab things from a whole Hanse spasms,

5720
02:16:23.191 --> 02:16:23.491
you know,

5721
02:16:23.491 --> 02:16:26.640
it's really weird before demonstrations and I always say,

5722
02:16:26.641 --> 02:16:27.050
Gosh,

5723
02:16:27.050 --> 02:16:27.380
should she,

5724
02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:29.500
that it's not like I'm not crazy.

5725
02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:32.050
It's just my hand shoot suddenly like that.

5726
02:16:32.051 --> 02:16:33.430
And I like when I grab something,

5727
02:16:33.431 --> 02:16:34.264
I starts,

5728
02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:36.460
it's really weird when my wife started noticing,

5729
02:16:36.461 --> 02:16:37.930
because I was sitting like this the whole time,

5730
02:16:38.310 --> 02:16:38.531
he says,

5731
02:16:38.531 --> 02:16:38.761
what is,

5732
02:16:38.761 --> 02:16:39.594
what would you hands?

5733
02:16:40.350 --> 02:16:41.330
And they get it Greek.

5734
02:16:41.550 --> 02:16:42.400
You can open it up.

5735
02:16:42.670 --> 02:16:43.000
Yup.

5736
02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:43.420
Wow.

5737
02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:47.860
That's gonna be like for a dude is this bad motherfucker former UFC champion.

5738
02:16:47.861 --> 02:16:49.390
That's got to be really like disturbing.

5739
02:16:49.510 --> 02:16:49.961
It is.

5740
02:16:49.961 --> 02:16:51.030
It is really the serving.

5741
02:16:51.100 --> 02:16:54.010
I don't like to see myself as weak.

5742
02:16:54.011 --> 02:16:57.460
I started to biking now because I can do with my knees now.

5743
02:16:57.840 --> 02:16:58.120
You know,

5744
02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:01.300
I'm actually going to get a nicer bike now show I got to because of the issues

5745
02:17:01.301 --> 02:17:02.020
as well.

5746
02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:02.261
Oh yeah.

5747
02:17:02.261 --> 02:17:06.040
I have no cartilage in my knee caps and there's nothing they can do for that.

5748
02:17:06.041 --> 02:17:06.551
Now I know,

5749
02:17:06.551 --> 02:17:07.750
I know everybody's got an email.

5750
02:17:07.751 --> 02:17:07.871
Oh,

5751
02:17:07.871 --> 02:17:08.740
I notice doctor.

5752
02:17:08.770 --> 02:17:09.100
No,

5753
02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:10.750
if you go to a real surgeon,

5754
02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:14.380
they will tell you there's nothing they can do when you have no car show.

5755
02:17:14.381 --> 02:17:16.120
And he kept the only thing they cannot fix,

5756
02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:20.570
actually al trash at the colon joke told me that's the reason why the mafioso is

5757
02:17:20.571 --> 02:17:21.700
break your meat kneecaps.

5758
02:17:21.910 --> 02:17:22.870
It's inflexible.

5759
02:17:23.140 --> 02:17:23.973
He can't.

5760
02:17:24.310 --> 02:17:25.143
And uh,

5761
02:17:25.420 --> 02:17:27.760
the bolt now if had patches out,

5762
02:17:27.850 --> 02:17:31.450
they can regrow my own cartilage that you get older to have a stem cells and

5763
02:17:31.451 --> 02:17:31.751
they get,

5764
02:17:31.751 --> 02:17:33.100
and that grows itself.

5765
02:17:33.101 --> 02:17:33.641
Like if they,

5766
02:17:33.641 --> 02:17:34.690
they explained like Ma,

5767
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:35.390
uh,

5768
02:17:35.390 --> 02:17:38.170
a matter of grass when pieces are out,

5769
02:17:38.171 --> 02:17:39.610
she put pieces of grass it there.

5770
02:17:39.611 --> 02:17:41.440
And that goes with the undergrads and it's strong.

5771
02:17:41.441 --> 02:17:41.711
Again,

5772
02:17:41.711 --> 02:17:42.880
that's how cartilage works.

5773
02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:43.481
He says,

5774
02:17:43.481 --> 02:17:44.380
but if you have none,

5775
02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:47.500
there's no way they can attach it to your kneecap.

5776
02:17:47.770 --> 02:17:48.910
Now there is something they can do.

5777
02:17:48.911 --> 02:17:51.820
They have to drill a hole and attention and a Teflon plate,

5778
02:17:52.390 --> 02:17:53.470
which will work.

5779
02:17:53.471 --> 02:17:55.810
But then unique emas 35% weaker,

5780
02:17:56.050 --> 02:17:59.110
more chance of breaking and when some breaks you're really done,

5781
02:17:59.440 --> 02:17:59.771
you know.

5782
02:17:59.771 --> 02:18:00.550
So he said,

5783
02:18:00.550 --> 02:18:01.121
well will come,

5784
02:18:01.121 --> 02:18:02.890
they will find something in a couple of years.

5785
02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:04.840
But right now walking stairs,

5786
02:18:04.841 --> 02:18:05.770
getting up,

5787
02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:07.180
sitting down,

5788
02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:08.531
up or down,

5789
02:18:08.531 --> 02:18:09.070
walking,

5790
02:18:09.070 --> 02:18:10.610
everything hurts and everything.

5791
02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:12.580
My friend Steve has his knees,

5792
02:18:12.670 --> 02:18:13.990
he was on the US ski team.

5793
02:18:13.991 --> 02:18:14.781
He's had like,

5794
02:18:14.781 --> 02:18:15.160
I dunno,

5795
02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:16.840
some insane amount of knee surgeries,

5796
02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:18.640
more than 20 knee surgeries as well.

5797
02:18:18.750 --> 02:18:19.060
Yeah.

5798
02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:20.220
And he has the,

5799
02:18:20.350 --> 02:18:22.000
he had no cartilage in his needs as well.

5800
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:27.040
And he's got these steel plates that are over the tops of his,

5801
02:18:27.041 --> 02:18:27.340
uh,

5802
02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:28.173
his joint.

5803
02:18:28.290 --> 02:18:30.190
Like we're where the cartilage used to be.

5804
02:18:30.191 --> 02:18:31.330
They resurfaced it.

5805
02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:31.991
Yeah.

5806
02:18:31.991 --> 02:18:32.450
What they do,

5807
02:18:32.450 --> 02:18:34.930
they go with lasers in and then it bleeds out.

5808
02:18:34.931 --> 02:18:35.261
Right.

5809
02:18:35.261 --> 02:18:36.550
Or they can do that too.

5810
02:18:36.551 --> 02:18:37.410
But with me,

5811
02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:38.273
the kneecap,

5812
02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:39.480
like with you there,

5813
02:18:39.481 --> 02:18:40.570
they're standing on each other.

5814
02:18:40.571 --> 02:18:42.280
Those that said the kneecap,

5815
02:18:42.490 --> 02:18:44.290
when I stretch my leg and I bended,

5816
02:18:44.590 --> 02:18:45.820
it already moved again.

5817
02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.170
So whatever they attach it,

5818
02:18:47.171 --> 02:18:48.430
it's in constant motion.

5819
02:18:48.700 --> 02:18:50.800
You can't do anything like between the knees,

5820
02:18:50.801 --> 02:18:52.060
between your upper leg,

5821
02:18:52.090 --> 02:18:52.960
your lower leg.

5822
02:18:53.170 --> 02:18:53.381
Yeah.

5823
02:18:53.381 --> 02:18:57.220
Their stuff that they can put in between and we surface and they do that.

5824
02:18:57.270 --> 02:18:57.700
Uh,

5825
02:18:57.700 --> 02:18:58.200
what is it?

5826
02:18:58.200 --> 02:18:59.440
They let you bleed.

5827
02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:01.720
They let you bleed your own blood.

5828
02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.440
You know,

5829
02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:04.720
the nobody lets me bleed my own blood.

5830
02:19:05.190 --> 02:19:05.651
A movie,

5831
02:19:05.651 --> 02:19:06.330
whether it again,

5832
02:19:06.330 --> 02:19:08.290
dodge ball or something then yeah,

5833
02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:12.220
but they drill these holes in the knees and it starts bleeding and that serves

5834
02:19:12.221 --> 02:19:13.000
all like that.

5835
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:13.331
Wow.

5836
02:19:13.331 --> 02:19:13.660
Yeah.

5837
02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:14.770
That's a scenes knee.

5838
02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:16.170
That's where you see that.

5839
02:19:16.380 --> 02:19:18.280
But I can see what a kneecap goes through.

5840
02:19:18.281 --> 02:19:19.510
I can't tell that everybody,

5841
02:19:19.511 --> 02:19:20.560
I don't want to go on top,

5842
02:19:21.010 --> 02:19:22.360
but the kneecap,

5843
02:19:22.660 --> 02:19:23.320
it's,

5844
02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:24.153
you know,

5845
02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:25.900
maybe on that other stuff I can,

5846
02:19:26.260 --> 02:19:30.320
I can put something like that on the other bones.

5847
02:19:30.321 --> 02:19:32.690
Not at an ECAP will that is his kneecap?

5848
02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:34.131
Yeah.

5849
02:19:34.131 --> 02:19:34.730
One piece.

5850
02:19:34.730 --> 02:19:34.971
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

5851
02:19:34.971 --> 02:19:35.750
I got all three.

5852
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:36.080
Yeah.

5853
02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:37.640
Well that's the bottom piece.

5854
02:19:37.641 --> 02:19:39.200
And then the top piece and where,

5855
02:19:39.220 --> 02:19:40.400
where the cartilage used to be.

5856
02:19:40.401 --> 02:19:40.731
Look at this,

5857
02:19:40.731 --> 02:19:41.001
Brian,

5858
02:19:41.001 --> 02:19:41.834
have you seen it?

5859
02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:44.010
Where did he do with this?

5860
02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:45.830
Well,

5861
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:49.040
Steve's a at the cutting edge because he's a doctor himself,

5862
02:19:49.250 --> 02:19:53.060
so he's well aware of what I need his number.

5863
02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:54.313
See that's a,

5864
02:19:54.980 --> 02:19:57.570
he just popped the thing out that's um,

5865
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:59.600
for the folks at home can see it.

5866
02:19:59.601 --> 02:20:00.434
He's a,

5867
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:01.881
he's happy with it.

5868
02:20:01.881 --> 02:20:04.910
Also you can see lower as I scroll down a bit,

5869
02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:06.290
you see that white thing?

5870
02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:08.960
That white thing is a artificial meniscus.

5871
02:20:09.500 --> 02:20:11.030
So he's got the double,

5872
02:20:11.031 --> 02:20:12.170
he's got a double whammy.

5873
02:20:12.290 --> 02:20:14.480
He's got a resurface knee.

5874
02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:18.410
So the top of his bone is covered with this steel plate.

5875
02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:19.610
And uh,

5876
02:20:19.610 --> 02:20:21.920
then he also has this white stuff here,

5877
02:20:22.130 --> 02:20:22.890
which is a,

5878
02:20:22.890 --> 02:20:24.530
an artificial meniscus pad.

5879
02:20:24.780 --> 02:20:24.931
<v 4>I,</v>

5880
02:20:24.931 --> 02:20:25.321
yeah,

5881
02:20:25.321 --> 02:20:26.190
I'm still trains.

5882
02:20:26.250 --> 02:20:27.450
I need his information.

5883
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.823
That's for real.

5884
02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:30.810
I love to do that man.

5885
02:20:30.811 --> 02:20:33.320
My knee sometimes when they shoot me up a cortisone shot,

5886
02:20:33.810 --> 02:20:35.610
then for like two and a half weeks,

5887
02:20:35.970 --> 02:20:37.860
it is paradise for me.

5888
02:20:37.890 --> 02:20:39.300
Like I can't walk stairs.

5889
02:20:39.301 --> 02:20:40.170
I can jump,

5890
02:20:40.410 --> 02:20:41.670
I can jump up from happiness.

5891
02:20:41.700 --> 02:20:42.241
Ooh.

5892
02:20:42.241 --> 02:20:43.230
I don't feel a thing.

5893
02:20:43.500 --> 02:20:45.270
It's amazing the difference.

5894
02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:45.990
How,

5895
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:47.460
what did you do to fucked up all,

5896
02:20:47.461 --> 02:20:48.600
you're a unique Harland.

5897
02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:53.410
I'm just very explosive and I think that just crushed everything.

5898
02:20:53.411 --> 02:20:53.660
I'm,

5899
02:20:53.660 --> 02:20:53.930
wow,

5900
02:20:53.930 --> 02:20:54.301
I'm blah,

5901
02:20:54.301 --> 02:20:54.781
I'm kicking,

5902
02:20:54.781 --> 02:20:55.081
kicking,

5903
02:20:55.081 --> 02:20:55.914
drilling.

5904
02:20:55.940 --> 02:20:57.060
I was in cakes to do it.

5905
02:20:57.090 --> 02:20:57.391
Right.

5906
02:20:57.391 --> 02:20:57.720
You know,

5907
02:20:57.720 --> 02:20:58.620
during the pain.

5908
02:20:59.040 --> 02:20:59.873
Just go through it,

5909
02:20:59.880 --> 02:21:00.241
you know?

5910
02:21:00.241 --> 02:21:01.350
And if it's Banco harder,

5911
02:21:01.351 --> 02:21:02.940
that's the mentality.

5912
02:21:02.941 --> 02:21:03.211
Right.

5913
02:21:03.211 --> 02:21:05.260
That's the only way I got to go through it.

5914
02:21:05.640 --> 02:21:05.941
When you,

5915
02:21:05.941 --> 02:21:08.590
now that you've done that all though and you seen like what,

5916
02:21:08.620 --> 02:21:10.530
what that damage can do to your body,

5917
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:11.270
whatever,

5918
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.780
you know,

5919
02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:13.020
I regret everything.

5920
02:21:13.020 --> 02:21:13.410
I go like,

5921
02:21:13.410 --> 02:21:14.730
why did I do it so crazy?

5922
02:21:14.910 --> 02:21:15.541
But now again,

5923
02:21:15.541 --> 02:21:17.550
when I see fighters go fulltime and I go,

5924
02:21:17.760 --> 02:21:18.511
sometimes I go,

5925
02:21:18.511 --> 02:21:19.344
wow,

5926
02:21:19.410 --> 02:21:20.040
it's weird.

5927
02:21:20.040 --> 02:21:20.760
I did all that.

5928
02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:22.040
You know that you'll,

5929
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:26.250
you look crazier back at life after you're out of it.

5930
02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:26.791
Yeah.

5931
02:21:26.791 --> 02:21:29.200
It's definitely way I never had though.

5932
02:21:30.940 --> 02:21:32.550
It comes show for people go like,

5933
02:21:32.610 --> 02:21:33.421
oh look at him,

5934
02:21:33.421 --> 02:21:34.320
but it's really not.

5935
02:21:34.321 --> 02:21:35.880
I never was nervous like that.

5936
02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:38.130
I was really good at talking to myself.

5937
02:21:38.340 --> 02:21:39.900
I did everything that in my life.

5938
02:21:39.901 --> 02:21:40.740
When I went through,

5939
02:21:41.010 --> 02:21:42.720
I realized it was all meditation.

5940
02:21:42.721 --> 02:21:43.650
I never taught,

5941
02:21:43.651 --> 02:21:44.880
everybody taught me anything,

5942
02:21:45.060 --> 02:21:46.830
but I'm just really talking to myself.

5943
02:21:46.831 --> 02:21:48.000
What's the worst thing that can happen?

5944
02:21:48.001 --> 02:21:48.660
Well,

5945
02:21:48.660 --> 02:21:50.970
you know the worst thing that can happen and you knock out,

5946
02:21:50.971 --> 02:21:51.804
you're not going to feel it.

5947
02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:52.501
Okay.

5948
02:21:52.501 --> 02:21:54.540
Can we get submitted Julia tap and it's over.

5949
02:21:54.540 --> 02:21:55.110
Okay.

5950
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.471
Okay.

5951
02:21:55.471 --> 02:21:56.490
It's the people talking.

5952
02:21:56.700 --> 02:21:57.750
That's the worst thing that really,

5953
02:21:57.751 --> 02:21:58.584
if you're think about it,

5954
02:21:58.590 --> 02:21:59.423
people talking shit.

5955
02:21:59.460 --> 02:21:59.820
Yeah.

5956
02:21:59.820 --> 02:22:00.450
So,

5957
02:22:00.450 --> 02:22:01.890
and since I don't care about that,

5958
02:22:02.310 --> 02:22:05.130
I wouldn't have known there was four wheel and I would always in that zone.

5959
02:22:05.460 --> 02:22:06.120
I would,

5960
02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:06.600
I would,

5961
02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:09.360
I was addicted to that feeling going there and go.

5962
02:22:10.110 --> 02:22:11.070
And then I would hear,

5963
02:22:11.220 --> 02:22:12.053
I would hear,

5964
02:22:12.180 --> 02:22:15.270
I would tell people's conversations at the first row after us,

5965
02:22:15.540 --> 02:22:16.231
I will go back.

5966
02:22:16.231 --> 02:22:16.501
I said,

5967
02:22:16.501 --> 02:22:18.330
I heard you talking about the movie yesterday evening.

5968
02:22:18.331 --> 02:22:18.631
All right,

5969
02:22:18.631 --> 02:22:18.960
so,

5970
02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:19.890
but Mari Smith's,

5971
02:22:20.250 --> 02:22:23.220
I was going to give the go Soka high cake and my,

5972
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.460
I'm,

5973
02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:24.510
I'm always listening to it,

5974
02:22:24.511 --> 02:22:26.430
the other corner and he goes,

5975
02:22:26.431 --> 02:22:27.370
watch out for the high kick.

5976
02:22:27.371 --> 02:22:27.810
I right away.

5977
02:22:27.810 --> 02:22:31.800
So I switched for a straight punch and the dogs also Japan,

5978
02:22:31.801 --> 02:22:32.041
right,

5979
02:22:32.041 --> 02:22:33.060
where they're really quiet.

5980
02:22:33.061 --> 02:22:35.460
And the yard there was here in America I guess,

5981
02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:36.560
cause it was the UFC,

5982
02:22:36.570 --> 02:22:37.770
my first UFC she fight.

5983
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.191
Oh,

5984
02:22:38.191 --> 02:22:39.090
Calsa Casa.

5985
02:22:39.091 --> 02:22:39.301
Okay.

5986
02:22:39.301 --> 02:22:39.900
Yeah.

5987
02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:41.400
And then Maury Smith was saying,

5988
02:22:42.050 --> 02:22:42.540
yeah,

5989
02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:46.170
because he saw me setting it up and then so I changed this writer.

5990
02:22:46.171 --> 02:22:49.590
I switched it to a straight punch because I heard him and I told him,

5991
02:22:49.591 --> 02:22:49.951
I say,

5992
02:22:49.951 --> 02:22:51.270
you should be quiet.

5993
02:22:51.271 --> 02:22:51.660
He says,

5994
02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:51.961
bus,

5995
02:22:51.961 --> 02:22:53.910
you're probably the only goal is that he had to go in it,

5996
02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:54.721
you know?

5997
02:22:54.721 --> 02:22:57.390
But I used to always do it again in French shamrocks blood,

5998
02:22:57.420 --> 02:22:57.840
uh,

5999
02:22:57.840 --> 02:22:58.673
blood book.

6000
02:22:58.710 --> 02:23:00.120
It's so funny to read.

6001
02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:00.781
He says,

6002
02:23:00.781 --> 02:23:00.991
yeah,

6003
02:23:00.991 --> 02:23:02.040
bus was always talking,

6004
02:23:02.041 --> 02:23:02.251
you know,

6005
02:23:02.251 --> 02:23:03.180
I think you kind of did it,

6006
02:23:03.450 --> 02:23:03.631
you know,

6007
02:23:03.631 --> 02:23:04.140
to,

6008
02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:05.970
to self meditation.

6009
02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:07.051
But then I say,

6010
02:23:07.051 --> 02:23:07.411
okay,

6011
02:23:07.411 --> 02:23:08.390
why do you think I are?

6012
02:23:08.450 --> 02:23:09.540
I have a Dutch Garner.

6013
02:23:09.720 --> 02:23:12.090
Why do you think are stocking English speaking English?

6014
02:23:12.990 --> 02:23:14.460
I did it for a reason.

6015
02:23:14.461 --> 02:23:15.630
If I do it in Dutch,

6016
02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:17.310
they're not going to understand what I'm saying.

6017
02:23:17.310 --> 02:23:18.640
But if I'm in the middle of a fight,

6018
02:23:18.650 --> 02:23:19.291
look at my corner.

6019
02:23:19.291 --> 02:23:19.561
I say,

6020
02:23:19.561 --> 02:23:21.330
do you want to go to Rebekah tonight?

6021
02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:23.040
What do you want to go more down tonight?

6022
02:23:23.070 --> 02:23:23.520
Yeah.

6023
02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:24.090
Okay,

6024
02:23:24.090 --> 02:23:24.360
let's go.

6025
02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:25.193
What are you going to drink?

6026
02:23:25.220 --> 02:23:25.550
You know,

6027
02:23:25.550 --> 02:23:29.100
I would just do some crazy stuff and then they would continue fighting and those

6028
02:23:29.101 --> 02:23:29.970
fighters who go like,

6029
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:31.770
what the hell is that?

6030
02:23:31.771 --> 02:23:32.551
It was a distraction.

6031
02:23:32.551 --> 02:23:33.600
It's just a distraction.

6032
02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:37.530
And I will do it in English because otherwise dodgy couldn't understand.

6033
02:23:37.531 --> 02:23:39.060
So that's why I spoke English.

6034
02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:41.550
When you put together this gym out in thousand oaks,

6035
02:23:41.551 --> 02:23:41.950
it's a,

6036
02:23:41.950 --> 02:23:42.271
you know,

6037
02:23:42.271 --> 02:23:43.730
you've got a really nice place.

6038
02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:44.551
It's very nice.

6039
02:23:44.551 --> 02:23:45.080
Were you,

6040
02:23:45.080 --> 02:23:45.480
um,

6041
02:23:45.480 --> 02:23:47.600
were you thinking about starting a team and,

6042
02:23:47.601 --> 02:23:47.861
and,

6043
02:23:47.861 --> 02:23:50.370
and training fighters and moving onto the next phase?

6044
02:23:50.450 --> 02:23:50.910
No,

6045
02:23:50.910 --> 02:23:51.061
no,

6046
02:23:51.061 --> 02:23:51.271
no.

6047
02:23:51.271 --> 02:23:53.970
For me it's just a good place that I can go and train.

6048
02:23:53.970 --> 02:23:54.900
I could still teach.

6049
02:23:54.901 --> 02:23:55.501
I almost,

6050
02:23:55.501 --> 02:23:55.731
I'm,

6051
02:23:55.731 --> 02:23:57.690
I'm pretty much almost all the time,

6052
02:23:57.691 --> 02:23:58.980
they're on Tuesdays and Thursday.

6053
02:23:58.981 --> 02:23:59.391
The teachers,

6054
02:23:59.391 --> 02:24:01.410
six o'clock myself for the general audience.

6055
02:24:01.411 --> 02:24:02.221
But it also approached,

6056
02:24:02.221 --> 02:24:05.910
been coming in because I go back to the basics and basics is effort of all the

6057
02:24:05.911 --> 02:24:06.501
magic happens.

6058
02:24:06.501 --> 02:24:06.770
Man.

6059
02:24:06.770 --> 02:24:08.100
They trust me in a lot of pros,

6060
02:24:08.101 --> 02:24:09.240
forget it or,

6061
02:24:09.241 --> 02:24:12.230
or their teachers don't want to say it anymore because now he's signed again,

6062
02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:14.070
that really high level and I don't care where you are,

6063
02:24:14.250 --> 02:24:15.870
I'm just going to tell you this is what you do wrong.

6064
02:24:15.871 --> 02:24:17.190
You can hit harder if you do it like this,

6065
02:24:17.191 --> 02:24:17.910
try it out.

6066
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:19.560
And only most of the time to try it out they go,

6067
02:24:19.561 --> 02:24:20.310
oh my God,

6068
02:24:20.310 --> 02:24:21.091
I hit much harder.

6069
02:24:21.091 --> 02:24:21.151
He,

6070
02:24:21.151 --> 02:24:21.361
she,

6071
02:24:21.361 --> 02:24:25.260
they just forget certain things and I like to put them back on the basics and I

6072
02:24:25.261 --> 02:24:28.320
liked it to have a gym at my name is very close to my house,

6073
02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:28.980
you know,

6074
02:24:28.980 --> 02:24:31.080
and I can actually be there Sunday morning.

6075
02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:32.580
She know I'm going to start doing now more.

6076
02:24:32.581 --> 02:24:33.140
I got to,

6077
02:24:33.140 --> 02:24:36.090
to the fight classes with the guys just to enjoy that.

6078
02:24:36.091 --> 02:24:37.200
I have a really good partner.

6079
02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:38.180
You know who,

6080
02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:39.013
uh,

6081
02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:43.260
thankfully he helped me out a lot because without him we could have not been

6082
02:24:43.261 --> 02:24:44.094
open,

6083
02:24:44.110 --> 02:24:44.550
uh,

6084
02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:47.520
because we lost a lot of money to make the gym.

6085
02:24:47.521 --> 02:24:49.770
But now we're at a place like the last half year.

6086
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:51.990
We started finally to make money and that's,

6087
02:24:52.290 --> 02:24:53.730
that's of two years being here,

6088
02:24:53.770 --> 02:24:54.930
six years at the other place.

6089
02:24:54.931 --> 02:24:55.740
So the ags,

6090
02:24:55.740 --> 02:24:56.700
we never made any money.

6091
02:24:56.701 --> 02:24:57.870
We were broke even at the other place.

6092
02:24:57.871 --> 02:25:00.470
And this is a eight and a half thousand square foot place.

6093
02:25:00.471 --> 02:25:01.510
You got Sauna as we,

6094
02:25:01.530 --> 02:25:04.200
I mean it's a really nice place and people love it,

6095
02:25:04.201 --> 02:25:04.411
you know,

6096
02:25:04.411 --> 02:25:05.750
and to find the thing that we have,

6097
02:25:05.751 --> 02:25:06.960
we have 30 people sign up,

6098
02:25:06.961 --> 02:25:07.794
say a month,

6099
02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:12.960
a five stay and those 25 there are all these tough guys that come in and be

6100
02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:14.380
their bodies saying,

6101
02:25:14.380 --> 02:25:14.600
man,

6102
02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:15.600
you can do that shit.

6103
02:25:15.630 --> 02:25:15.900
You know,

6104
02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:16.531
you got to do it.

6105
02:25:16.531 --> 02:25:17.230
I really look at that.

6106
02:25:17.230 --> 02:25:18.120
They make a lot of money.

6107
02:25:18.121 --> 02:25:21.480
So then they come in and they get beat up by blue belts,

6108
02:25:21.750 --> 02:25:22.321
you know,

6109
02:25:22.321 --> 02:25:24.040
little kids and that's it.

6110
02:25:24.041 --> 02:25:25.990
That's [inaudible] program there as well.

6111
02:25:26.020 --> 02:25:26.351
Yeah.

6112
02:25:26.351 --> 02:25:27.540
I got to hold Rigo cuff.

6113
02:25:27.541 --> 02:25:27.941
Otto,

6114
02:25:27.941 --> 02:25:31.150
he was a world champion last year at the Gracies cause six weeks.

6115
02:25:31.151 --> 02:25:33.010
She told me this morning he's got to go another gun.

6116
02:25:33.011 --> 02:25:33.940
And in Long Beach.

6117
02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:35.051
He's unbelievable.

6118
02:25:35.051 --> 02:25:38.460
He came in was five days in the country and he wants to,

6119
02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:39.011
he told me,

6120
02:25:39.011 --> 02:25:39.401
hey bars,

6121
02:25:39.401 --> 02:25:41.280
the naga championships are in a vigorous,

6122
02:25:41.290 --> 02:25:42.123
you think I should go?

6123
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:43.150
I say,

6124
02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:44.290
you're thinking you can do it?

6125
02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:44.651
He said,

6126
02:25:44.651 --> 02:25:44.771
yeah.

6127
02:25:44.771 --> 02:25:45.011
I said,

6128
02:25:45.011 --> 02:25:45.611
but you didn't train.

6129
02:25:45.611 --> 02:25:45.791
He said,

6130
02:25:45.791 --> 02:25:45.910
no,

6131
02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:46.720
I want to do it.

6132
02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:47.140
I said,

6133
02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:48.370
oh well we'll drive you over there.

6134
02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:50.860
So brought him and he won gold right away.

6135
02:25:50.860 --> 02:25:52.540
And then he won the one at the Gracie.

6136
02:25:52.541 --> 02:25:53.410
He won gold again.

6137
02:25:53.411 --> 02:25:54.760
So it's a very,

6138
02:25:54.761 --> 02:25:57.580
very high level that guy.

6139
02:25:57.890 --> 02:25:58.723
Cause he teach.

6140
02:25:58.800 --> 02:25:59.170
Yeah,

6141
02:25:59.170 --> 02:26:00.003
both.

6142
02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:00.940
And he is,

6143
02:26:01.780 --> 02:26:03.280
I've never had one complaint from him,

6144
02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:04.001
you know,

6145
02:26:04.001 --> 02:26:04.151
a,

6146
02:26:04.151 --> 02:26:04.601
sorry,

6147
02:26:04.601 --> 02:26:07.300
you got to do with five classes more because we're not pulling it now.

6148
02:26:07.301 --> 02:26:08.860
Right now I have no problem.

6149
02:26:08.861 --> 02:26:09.131
Boom.

6150
02:26:09.131 --> 02:26:09.964
Right away.

6151
02:26:10.090 --> 02:26:10.451
You know,

6152
02:26:10.451 --> 02:26:11.530
he's the light.

6153
02:26:11.531 --> 02:26:12.130
The best,

6154
02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:12.641
best.

6155
02:26:12.641 --> 02:26:13.720
Then we have everybody,

6156
02:26:14.050 --> 02:26:17.950
all the parents for kids and everybody's telling me,

6157
02:26:17.951 --> 02:26:19.270
my God is such a great guy.

6158
02:26:19.271 --> 02:26:20.210
So teach kids classes.

6159
02:26:20.370 --> 02:26:21.250
Each class is awesome.

6160
02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:22.330
One of the kid classes,

6161
02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:23.860
uh,

6162
02:26:23.860 --> 02:26:24.650
at four o'clock.

6163
02:26:24.650 --> 02:26:25.420
Most of the time.

6164
02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:26.080
Yeah.

6165
02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:28.960
Four o'clock on Saturdays that I believe at noon from,

6166
02:26:28.961 --> 02:26:29.141
no,

6167
02:26:29.141 --> 02:26:29.700
that's great.

6168
02:26:29.700 --> 02:26:31.990
And thousand oaks where you're at as an awesome spot.

6169
02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:32.770
It's beautiful.

6170
02:26:32.770 --> 02:26:33.850
It's really nice.

6171
02:26:33.851 --> 02:26:34.510
So quiet.

6172
02:26:34.510 --> 02:26:34.961
You'll be,

6173
02:26:34.961 --> 02:26:35.291
yeah,

6174
02:26:35.291 --> 02:26:35.621
no,

6175
02:26:35.621 --> 02:26:36.070
it's,

6176
02:26:36.070 --> 02:26:37.090
when we arrived there,

6177
02:26:37.091 --> 02:26:38.860
we made the turn on mostly boulevard.

6178
02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:40.900
I saw the promenade there with,

6179
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:41.510
you know,

6180
02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:44.130
there was a band playing and Friday night they're worse.

6181
02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:44.441
I go,

6182
02:26:44.441 --> 02:26:44.771
wow,

6183
02:26:44.771 --> 02:26:45.551
we want to live here.

6184
02:26:45.551 --> 02:26:46.060
You know,

6185
02:26:46.060 --> 02:26:47.140
no parking meters,

6186
02:26:47.141 --> 02:26:47.801
no nothing.

6187
02:26:47.801 --> 02:26:48.130
You know,

6188
02:26:48.130 --> 02:26:49.360
it's a nice place.

6189
02:26:49.690 --> 02:26:51.010
Best school system,

6190
02:26:51.011 --> 02:26:52.840
like blue ribbon schools all around,

6191
02:26:52.841 --> 02:26:53.480
you know,

6192
02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:53.690
it's,

6193
02:26:53.690 --> 02:26:54.640
it's cool for the kids.

6194
02:26:54.641 --> 02:26:57.280
Safe second safest city in the country.

6195
02:26:57.430 --> 02:26:57.671
You know,

6196
02:26:57.671 --> 02:26:59.590
the other one has Irvine,

6197
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.650
Irvine.

6198
02:26:59.650 --> 02:27:02.140
Irvine is like the safest city in the country.

6199
02:27:02.700 --> 02:27:04.450
See Irvine is very,

6200
02:27:04.451 --> 02:27:05.284
very safe.

6201
02:27:05.380 --> 02:27:06.340
It's all white people.

6202
02:27:06.370 --> 02:27:07.203
Yeah.

6203
02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:08.561
If I,

6204
02:27:08.561 --> 02:27:09.820
if I was a criminal,

6205
02:27:10.180 --> 02:27:13.570
you've of course it all the garage doors.

6206
02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:14.291
My friends,

6207
02:27:14.291 --> 02:27:18.390
he had a $6,000 bike and leaves the garage door and we always said,

6208
02:27:18.391 --> 02:27:18.561
you know,

6209
02:27:18.561 --> 02:27:19.750
you got to close the garage.

6210
02:27:19.990 --> 02:27:20.651
Sure enough,

6211
02:27:20.651 --> 02:27:23.170
they stole his bike and thousand oaks thousand oaks,

6212
02:27:23.171 --> 02:27:23.710
they say,

6213
02:27:23.710 --> 02:27:24.160
but that's,

6214
02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:27.700
that's the smarter criminal goes to those places because everybody or you don't

6215
02:27:27.701 --> 02:27:28.900
have to lock your doors,

6216
02:27:29.050 --> 02:27:29.351
you know,

6217
02:27:29.351 --> 02:27:30.430
because it says safe.

6218
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:33.750
That's why it got robbed in Burbank that said sketchy.

6219
02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:36.070
Sketchy.

6220
02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:36.410
Yeah.

6221
02:27:36.410 --> 02:27:36.720
Yeah.

6222
02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:37.300
To banks.

6223
02:27:37.300 --> 02:27:39.580
Very close to a lot of funky areas.

6224
02:27:39.900 --> 02:27:41.980
Know thousand oaks in the middle of fucking nowhere.

6225
02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:42.550
Sure.

6226
02:27:42.550 --> 02:27:42.761
Yeah.

6227
02:27:42.761 --> 02:27:43.780
Nobody wants to go there,

6228
02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:44.350
you know?

6229
02:27:44.350 --> 02:27:45.161
But then once you're there,

6230
02:27:45.161 --> 02:27:45.440
it's,

6231
02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:50.440
they call it pilot town because the pilots would see from the top that there was

6232
02:27:51.101 --> 02:27:52.120
no pollution there.

6233
02:27:52.170 --> 02:27:54.460
That's how it got started with all pilots living there.

6234
02:27:54.461 --> 02:27:55.820
And then it becomes an oh yeah,

6235
02:27:55.870 --> 02:27:56.340
yeah.

6236
02:27:56.340 --> 02:27:56.610
Oh,

6237
02:27:56.610 --> 02:27:57.750
that's interesting.

6238
02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:58.840
And then it became a,

6239
02:27:58.841 --> 02:27:59.331
because they say,

6240
02:27:59.331 --> 02:27:59.421
oh,

6241
02:27:59.421 --> 02:27:59.951
it's the valley.

6242
02:27:59.951 --> 02:28:00.251
I said,

6243
02:28:00.251 --> 02:28:00.431
dude,

6244
02:28:00.431 --> 02:28:01.840
we're 50 miles out of the valley.

6245
02:28:01.841 --> 02:28:03.130
We were like far away from it.

6246
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.520
But that's,

6247
02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:04.510
it's like 40 degrees,

6248
02:28:04.511 --> 02:28:06.160
lower temperature.

6249
02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:08.610
The temperature wise then the valley has,

6250
02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:08.981
yeah.

6251
02:28:08.981 --> 02:28:10.660
You get that breeze from the ocean too.

6252
02:28:10.661 --> 02:28:13.240
I feel like the further you can get away from La,

6253
02:28:13.241 --> 02:28:14.110
the better you are at.

6254
02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:16.450
There's too many fucking people here.

6255
02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:17.510
The other day,

6256
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:19.030
Saturday in the afternoon.

6257
02:28:19.031 --> 02:28:19.630
Okay.

6258
02:28:19.630 --> 02:28:19.841
I,

6259
02:28:19.841 --> 02:28:20.020
uh,

6260
02:28:20.020 --> 02:28:21.990
drove down to meet a friend of mine and Bellflower,

6261
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:23.450
<v 0>so I drove down.</v>

6262
02:28:23.690 --> 02:28:27.260
It took me two hours to get there in two and a half hours to get back on a

6263
02:28:27.261 --> 02:28:28.060
Saturday.

6264
02:28:28.060 --> 02:28:28.310
Yeah.

6265
02:28:28.310 --> 02:28:33.260
Bumper to bumper traffic stopped dead on the one 34 stopped dead on the four oh

6266
02:28:33.261 --> 02:28:34.094
five,

6267
02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:36.620
I switched to two 10 stopped dead.

6268
02:28:36.890 --> 02:28:38.140
It was fucking nuts.

6269
02:28:38.141 --> 02:28:39.710
The one a one stop dead.

6270
02:28:39.711 --> 02:28:42.890
The five stop dead everywhere on Saturday.

6271
02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:44.440
Like what happens if

6272
02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:45.730
<v 4>the shit hits the fan?</v>

6273
02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:49.420
That's why I always save all my telephone calls.

6274
02:28:49.421 --> 02:28:50.530
I saved there for one day.

6275
02:28:50.531 --> 02:28:50.741
If I,

6276
02:28:50.741 --> 02:28:51.191
for instance,

6277
02:28:51.191 --> 02:28:52.570
have to go to San Diego,

6278
02:28:52.900 --> 02:28:56.590
that's where all my phone calls start happening because I save up for that time,

6279
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:58.900
the two and a half hours on the world or whatever it is,

6280
02:28:58.901 --> 02:29:02.050
maybe three hours of just traffic and then I make all the phone calls,

6281
02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:04.480
phone calls to do it at the same time.

6282
02:29:04.481 --> 02:29:04.781
You know what?

6283
02:29:04.781 --> 02:29:09.150
I do bus route and I listen to audible.com audible.com yeah.

6284
02:29:09.190 --> 02:29:09.870
Yeah.

6285
02:29:09.870 --> 02:29:10.900
This Fox again.

6286
02:29:10.930 --> 02:29:12.130
Is that what the commercial is?

6287
02:29:12.131 --> 02:29:12.964
Not Commercial.

6288
02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:13.961
I do though.

6289
02:29:13.961 --> 02:29:14.711
It's amazing.

6290
02:29:14.711 --> 02:29:15.090
It's great.

6291
02:29:15.090 --> 02:29:15.881
Audible books.

6292
02:29:15.881 --> 02:29:16.960
Audio books are amazing.

6293
02:29:17.020 --> 02:29:17.441
Oh,

6294
02:29:17.441 --> 02:29:20.500
you know I love on Hln they have the HSA crime cases.

6295
02:29:20.501 --> 02:29:21.101
I love that.

6296
02:29:21.101 --> 02:29:21.700
You know,

6297
02:29:21.700 --> 02:29:26.560
and then the men walked in but he forgot one thing.

6298
02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:30.060
One thing that left one another thing on the,

6299
02:29:30.061 --> 02:29:30.894
on the road.

6300
02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:32.440
Oh yeah.

6301
02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:34.030
Mysterious is on Hln.

6302
02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:35.050
I don't know.

6303
02:29:35.050 --> 02:29:39.360
Tell and HLN headline news from CNN and I guess it is or something.

6304
02:29:39.430 --> 02:29:40.263
Also satellite,

6305
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:43.660
satellite radio and then you got those,

6306
02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:44.681
those great things.

6307
02:29:44.681 --> 02:29:45.540
But are there things,

6308
02:29:45.541 --> 02:29:47.550
you know watching the Jody area escape?

6309
02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:48.790
Oh my God.

6310
02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:50.800
That if she gets out,

6311
02:29:50.801 --> 02:29:53.020
that's like the weirdest thing to total psycho.

6312
02:29:53.170 --> 02:29:54.040
Once I go,

6313
02:29:54.250 --> 02:29:56.020
I mean she goes head to head with the,

6314
02:29:56.050 --> 02:29:59.140
with the prosecutor and then when she thinks she has the best of him,

6315
02:29:59.141 --> 02:30:00.420
she like chuckles it.

6316
02:30:00.430 --> 02:30:00.850
Okay,

6317
02:30:00.850 --> 02:30:01.683
I got you.

6318
02:30:01.730 --> 02:30:02.000
I go,

6319
02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:02.730
dude.

6320
02:30:02.730 --> 02:30:02.950
Yeah,

6321
02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:04.540
people are watching you.

6322
02:30:04.541 --> 02:30:04.871
You know,

6323
02:30:04.871 --> 02:30:06.040
you'll see they see it.

6324
02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:06.581
Yeah.

6325
02:30:06.581 --> 02:30:07.480
If you don't know that story,

6326
02:30:07.481 --> 02:30:08.680
she stabbed the guy,

6327
02:30:08.681 --> 02:30:09.514
cut his head,

6328
02:30:10.510 --> 02:30:11.240
shot him,

6329
02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:12.073
and then shut up.

6330
02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:13.390
She did a bunch of fucked up,

6331
02:30:13.570 --> 02:30:16.270
but does she goes to the problem because she said she shot him first,

6332
02:30:16.271 --> 02:30:19.780
but now all the blood was there and the shell casing was on top of the blood.

6333
02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:21.340
So she shot him.

6334
02:30:21.341 --> 02:30:25.260
She killed him for snap them into back crazy.

6335
02:30:25.290 --> 02:30:25.660
Yeah.

6336
02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:27.350
And had rented a special car.

6337
02:30:27.351 --> 02:30:28.390
They wanted to give her a red car.

6338
02:30:28.391 --> 02:30:28.641
She says,

6339
02:30:28.641 --> 02:30:28.811
no,

6340
02:30:28.811 --> 02:30:31.300
I want to a wide one because she didn't want to attract attention,

6341
02:30:31.660 --> 02:30:32.230
you know,

6342
02:30:32.230 --> 02:30:32.560
uh,

6343
02:30:32.560 --> 02:30:33.910
three cans of gasoline.

6344
02:30:33.911 --> 02:30:36.850
So she didn't have to stop anywhere so she could be traced back.

6345
02:30:37.270 --> 02:30:37.810
I mean,

6346
02:30:37.810 --> 02:30:40.270
it was the wildest thing that a 22 gun,

6347
02:30:40.271 --> 02:30:43.180
which happened to be the murder weapon the day before she left,

6348
02:30:43.181 --> 02:30:46.360
very mysteriously disappeared from her grandparents.

6349
02:30:46.361 --> 02:30:46.721
Where she,

6350
02:30:46.721 --> 02:30:47.554
by the way lives,

6351
02:30:48.490 --> 02:30:49.960
you're locked into this story.

6352
02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:50.171
Oh,

6353
02:30:50.171 --> 02:30:50.531
I don't,

6354
02:30:50.531 --> 02:30:50.640
yeah,

6355
02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:51.390
this is on.

6356
02:30:51.390 --> 02:30:52.240
It's amazing.

6357
02:30:52.270 --> 02:30:55.570
Isn't it fucked up when you see someone whose life just went completely off the

6358
02:30:55.571 --> 02:30:56.404
rails.

6359
02:30:56.500 --> 02:30:57.970
When you see someone crazy like that,

6360
02:30:57.971 --> 02:31:01.630
just one day wax out and just stabbed somebody and shoot some.

6361
02:31:01.631 --> 02:31:02.710
And this one,

6362
02:31:02.711 --> 02:31:03.191
you know,

6363
02:31:03.191 --> 02:31:06.490
she was like three months away from him and that she was still following him.

6364
02:31:06.491 --> 02:31:07.510
He did things on stage,

6365
02:31:07.511 --> 02:31:08.890
whatever I was public speaking or something.

6366
02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:11.020
She would like make pictures and she would tell people,

6367
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:12.220
isn't the beautiful,

6368
02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:14.170
is it be while they already separated?

6369
02:31:14.171 --> 02:31:14.411
I go,

6370
02:31:14.411 --> 02:31:14.570
yeah,

6371
02:31:14.570 --> 02:31:15.130
that's,

6372
02:31:15.130 --> 02:31:15.963
that's,

6373
02:31:16.510 --> 02:31:17.020
yeah.

6374
02:31:17.020 --> 02:31:17.301
Well,

6375
02:31:17.301 --> 02:31:18.010
dot guy.

6376
02:31:18.010 --> 02:31:19.550
Fuck the shit of that bed.

6377
02:31:19.800 --> 02:31:20.080
That's

6378
02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:21.360
<v 0>part of what happened there.</v>

6379
02:31:21.361 --> 02:31:23.400
That kind of broker that she did some,

6380
02:31:23.401 --> 02:31:24.540
that was the reason to her,

6381
02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:24.810
oh,

6382
02:31:24.810 --> 02:31:25.351
everything.

6383
02:31:25.351 --> 02:31:26.340
He did everything well,

6384
02:31:26.341 --> 02:31:28.440
but now she tried to give it to say he's a pedophile,

6385
02:31:28.441 --> 02:31:28.681
you know?

6386
02:31:28.681 --> 02:31:30.060
And it's like what I mean,

6387
02:31:30.061 --> 02:31:32.100
drags is to the month poor guy,

6388
02:31:32.101 --> 02:31:32.580
you know,

6389
02:31:32.580 --> 02:31:33.350
he's already done.

6390
02:31:33.350 --> 02:31:34.183
Yeah.

6391
02:31:34.230 --> 02:31:35.063
Yeah.

6392
02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:37.260
But just Paris has already done the worst.

6393
02:31:37.290 --> 02:31:37.870
I know.

6394
02:31:37.870 --> 02:31:38.703
It's amazing.

6395
02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:39.151
Yeah.

6396
02:31:39.151 --> 02:31:39.984
The um,

6397
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:41.590
they sent my friend Tony Zara,

6398
02:31:41.630 --> 02:31:42.420
I remember Tony,

6399
02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:43.251
a turtle from,

6400
02:31:43.251 --> 02:31:43.680
uh,

6401
02:31:43.680 --> 02:31:44.430
Columbus.

6402
02:31:44.430 --> 02:31:46.680
He has a great saying that I say all the time,

6403
02:31:46.710 --> 02:31:50.520
it said a psychotic and erotic or very close to each other.

6404
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:51.221
Oh yeah,

6405
02:31:51.221 --> 02:31:52.290
we're very close to each other.

6406
02:31:52.440 --> 02:31:56.310
And those really crazy girls are oftentimes the best in bed.

6407
02:31:56.380 --> 02:31:57.600
So nutty.

6408
02:31:57.601 --> 02:31:59.610
And the shit they'll do is so crazy.

6409
02:32:00.270 --> 02:32:01.920
So this fucking guy,

6410
02:32:01.950 --> 02:32:04.860
I mean you listen to some of the text messages that he was sending her.

6411
02:32:04.890 --> 02:32:05.190
You know,

6412
02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:06.540
you're my dirty little whore,

6413
02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:09.960
Joanie and porn movies.

6414
02:32:09.961 --> 02:32:11.030
Like people write like that.

6415
02:32:11.500 --> 02:32:11.860
Oh,

6416
02:32:11.860 --> 02:32:14.040
this fucking check his text messages.

6417
02:32:14.460 --> 02:32:15.293
I'll send you something.

6418
02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:16.343
He'll forward you.

6419
02:32:16.820 --> 02:32:17.150
Yeah.

6420
02:32:17.150 --> 02:32:17.510
Thank you.

6421
02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:18.343
Yeah.

6422
02:32:19.310 --> 02:32:20.143
So polite.

6423
02:32:21.210 --> 02:32:22.680
There's a lot of nutty people out there,

6424
02:32:22.681 --> 02:32:23.090
man.

6425
02:32:23.090 --> 02:32:23.670
There's a lot of them.

6426
02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:24.660
Fucking nutty people.

6427
02:32:25.410 --> 02:32:26.550
<v 4>Very crazy people.</v>

6428
02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:27.573
I showed in my wife,

6429
02:32:27.850 --> 02:32:28.240
uh,

6430
02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:28.870
Dick Karate.

6431
02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:29.703
I

6432
02:32:30.830 --> 02:32:32.070
did karate guy story,

6433
02:32:32.080 --> 02:32:33.150
the street karate guy.

6434
02:32:33.180 --> 02:32:33.660
What happened?

6435
02:32:33.660 --> 02:32:33.751
Oh,

6436
02:32:33.751 --> 02:32:34.710
this is a funny story.

6437
02:32:34.740 --> 02:32:35.500
Okay.

6438
02:32:35.500 --> 02:32:36.090
We're at,

6439
02:32:36.090 --> 02:32:36.810
um,

6440
02:32:36.810 --> 02:32:37.800
at um,

6441
02:32:38.100 --> 02:32:41.210
Kimbo has to fight and um,

6442
02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:45.840
before the fight we go to a tap out party and those people are there.

6443
02:32:45.841 --> 02:32:46.950
And then the guys,

6444
02:32:46.951 --> 02:32:48.350
he stuff guys that they're one of us,

6445
02:32:48.390 --> 02:32:52.050
I think selling jewelry or something and he was with a bunch of guys and from

6446
02:32:52.051 --> 02:32:52.510
the guys,

6447
02:32:52.510 --> 02:32:54.240
I think he was the toughest guy.

6448
02:32:54.750 --> 02:32:55.201
So,

6449
02:32:55.201 --> 02:32:55.590
um,

6450
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:58.630
we're talking and of course he didn't know who I was,

6451
02:32:58.631 --> 02:32:59.580
so that was the best thing.

6452
02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:01.810
And that people were talking about finding it.

6453
02:33:01.811 --> 02:33:03.540
Suddenly he comes to fourth and he goes,

6454
02:33:04.080 --> 02:33:04.913
yeah,

6455
02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:06.630
I used to do a karate.

6456
02:33:06.840 --> 02:33:07.171
He says,

6457
02:33:07.171 --> 02:33:09.630
but not a normal cardiac is to do street karate.

6458
02:33:09.750 --> 02:33:10.021
I go,

6459
02:33:10.021 --> 02:33:10.800
wow,

6460
02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:12.000
street karate was so,

6461
02:33:12.001 --> 02:33:12.510
what is that?

6462
02:33:12.510 --> 02:33:12.751
He said,

6463
02:33:12.751 --> 02:33:13.500
well,

6464
02:33:13.500 --> 02:33:18.500
I can tell you one thing that my routine has saved me like six,

6465
02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:19.470
seven times.

6466
02:33:19.830 --> 02:33:20.430
And I go,

6467
02:33:20.430 --> 02:33:21.263
your routine.

6468
02:33:21.390 --> 02:33:22.170
Yeah,

6469
02:33:22.170 --> 02:33:22.501
I got,

6470
02:33:22.501 --> 02:33:23.160
okay,

6471
02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:25.140
you got to show me that routine.

6472
02:33:25.260 --> 02:33:25.561
And you know,

6473
02:33:25.561 --> 02:33:26.340
because I would,

6474
02:33:26.340 --> 02:33:27.210
I would love to learn.

6475
02:33:27.780 --> 02:33:30.870
So the guy comes to me and I actually put this in the movie,

6476
02:33:30.871 --> 02:33:31.770
here comes the boom.

6477
02:33:32.010 --> 02:33:32.550
You know,

6478
02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:33.900
that was a true story.

6479
02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:35.220
I and I,

6480
02:33:35.580 --> 02:33:35.910
well,

6481
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:36.710
there's a long story,

6482
02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:37.543
but anyway,

6483
02:33:38.020 --> 02:33:39.030
so the guy comes to me,

6484
02:33:39.031 --> 02:33:39.451
he says,

6485
02:33:39.451 --> 02:33:40.021
first of all,

6486
02:33:40.021 --> 02:33:42.420
I would stand there and then out of the blue I will go,

6487
02:33:43.220 --> 02:33:43.560
no,

6488
02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:43.641
no,

6489
02:33:43.641 --> 02:33:43.711
no,

6490
02:33:43.711 --> 02:33:44.330
no.

6491
02:33:44.330 --> 02:33:45.810
He got his goes first with his elbow.

6492
02:33:45.811 --> 02:33:46.830
He coach to me,

6493
02:33:46.890 --> 02:33:47.760
he does it to me,

6494
02:33:48.110 --> 02:33:48.720
disclose,

6495
02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:51.000
right and blah.

6496
02:33:51.180 --> 02:33:52.013
And then he goes,

6497
02:33:52.700 --> 02:33:54.750
and he was shaking in front of my face.

6498
02:33:54.751 --> 02:33:55.584
He's serious,

6499
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:56.310
he's serious.

6500
02:33:56.310 --> 02:33:57.440
He's this close to my face,

6501
02:33:57.441 --> 02:33:57.581
right?

6502
02:33:57.581 --> 02:33:59.550
Shaking like this loss and my friends,

6503
02:33:59.551 --> 02:34:01.560
everybody is already like almost dying,

6504
02:34:01.561 --> 02:34:02.340
laughing.

6505
02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:03.031
And then he says,

6506
02:34:03.031 --> 02:34:05.250
and then a moment he's perplexed by and I go,

6507
02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:06.480
I go to the neck.

6508
02:34:06.660 --> 02:34:07.021
And then he,

6509
02:34:07.021 --> 02:34:07.200
oh,

6510
02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:07.991
they always do this.

6511
02:34:07.991 --> 02:34:08.824
She said,

6512
02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:09.511
it says in there,

6513
02:34:09.511 --> 02:34:10.344
grab him.

6514
02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:11.940
And now he kept eye contact with me,

6515
02:34:11.941 --> 02:34:12.240
right?

6516
02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:12.751
And he grabbed,

6517
02:34:12.751 --> 02:34:13.220
she says,

6518
02:34:13.220 --> 02:34:14.053
God.

6519
02:34:18.830 --> 02:34:22.360
<v 0>So he threw knees to the body throughout grounds,</v>

6520
02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:25.400
stopped contact with me and he stops,

6521
02:34:25.401 --> 02:34:26.090
you know,

6522
02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:26.923
okay.

6523
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.891
So I look at him,

6524
02:34:27.891 --> 02:34:28.724
I go,

6525
02:34:29.540 --> 02:34:29.990
<v 7>okay,</v>

6526
02:34:29.990 --> 02:34:30.710
<v 4>Nah,</v>

6527
02:34:30.710 --> 02:34:31.610
you never did that.

6528
02:34:32.390 --> 02:34:33.350
Total bullshit.

6529
02:34:33.890 --> 02:34:34.280
I said,

6530
02:34:34.280 --> 02:34:37.550
you practiced this in the mirror and it looks really cool,

6531
02:34:37.850 --> 02:34:39.230
but you never did this.

6532
02:34:39.380 --> 02:34:40.910
He know know his friends were like,

6533
02:34:41.210 --> 02:34:44.120
they were waiting for my reaction because they were in awe.

6534
02:34:44.121 --> 02:34:44.391
You know,

6535
02:34:44.391 --> 02:34:44.670
this,

6536
02:34:44.670 --> 02:34:45.503
this guy was,

6537
02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:47.420
it was his glory.

6538
02:34:47.660 --> 02:34:49.070
And then when at the moment I said,

6539
02:34:49.071 --> 02:34:49.904
total bullshit.

6540
02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:52.940
I started talking and there's not a guy came and she know who he is.

6541
02:34:53.150 --> 02:34:54.720
He always actually professional fighter.

6542
02:34:54.721 --> 02:34:55.910
So the whole group left,

6543
02:34:55.911 --> 02:35:00.911
but the fact the deface the facial expression from all those guys to all dressed

6544
02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:02.873
the same,

6545
02:35:02.930 --> 02:35:05.210
like do you Scacchi switch shirts over the top?

6546
02:35:05.211 --> 02:35:06.470
All jewelry everywhere.

6547
02:35:06.471 --> 02:35:07.160
You know the,

6548
02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:08.300
those guys,

6549
02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:09.733
exactly.

6550
02:35:10.180 --> 02:35:11.630
The streets karate guy,

6551
02:35:11.631 --> 02:35:14.960
his routine saved his life seven times,

6552
02:35:15.260 --> 02:35:15.621
you know,

6553
02:35:15.621 --> 02:35:18.920
and they tell me that you believe that crap.

6554
02:35:18.921 --> 02:35:21.380
It was the most insane thing I've ever seen and I did.

6555
02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:23.120
And here comes the boom you've ever had,

6556
02:35:23.121 --> 02:35:26.120
but need to deface throwaway stub.

6557
02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:26.600
Right?

6558
02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:27.440
Victory Dance.

6559
02:35:27.441 --> 02:35:27.801
You know,

6560
02:35:27.801 --> 02:35:31.010
and I that I told that the backstage camera for hit goes to them.

6561
02:35:31.011 --> 02:35:31.371
I said,

6562
02:35:31.371 --> 02:35:32.630
this is a true story.

6563
02:35:32.810 --> 02:35:34.190
Somebody told me this thing,

6564
02:35:34.191 --> 02:35:34.890
nick,

6565
02:35:34.890 --> 02:35:36.000
<v 0>there's a lot of those knuckleheads,</v>

6566
02:35:36.001 --> 02:35:36.211
right?

6567
02:35:36.211 --> 02:35:37.560
Those street defense guys,

6568
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:39.130
they're like fake karate guys.

6569
02:35:39.150 --> 02:35:39.541
And you know,

6570
02:35:39.541 --> 02:35:41.100
the worst part is they say,

6571
02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:41.611
yeah,

6572
02:35:41.611 --> 02:35:43.860
we cannot use it in the ring because it's way too dangerous.

6573
02:35:43.861 --> 02:35:44.430
Yeah.

6574
02:35:44.430 --> 02:35:44.701
I said,

6575
02:35:44.701 --> 02:35:44.881
well,

6576
02:35:44.881 --> 02:35:46.240
if you could kill somebody like this,

6577
02:35:46.241 --> 02:35:47.430
she can also not kill him.

6578
02:35:47.610 --> 02:35:47.820
Yeah.

6579
02:35:47.820 --> 02:35:48.150
Right.

6580
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:48.740
I mean,

6581
02:35:48.740 --> 02:35:49.550
what,

6582
02:35:49.550 --> 02:35:50.383
yeah,

6583
02:35:50.390 --> 02:35:52.920
like that kind of control control.

6584
02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:53.390
You've just,

6585
02:35:53.390 --> 02:35:53.650
uh,

6586
02:35:53.650 --> 02:35:55.140
the techniques are too lethal boss.

6587
02:35:55.141 --> 02:35:55.711
You don't understand.

6588
02:35:55.711 --> 02:35:55.951
They're like,

6589
02:35:55.951 --> 02:35:57.900
it's like dropping a nuclear explosion on you.

6590
02:35:58.010 --> 02:35:58.591
You know what I'm saying?

6591
02:35:58.591 --> 02:35:58.751
Yeah.

6592
02:35:58.751 --> 02:35:59.960
The one in spine shoulder,

6593
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:00.903
uh,

6594
02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:01.351
yeah.

6595
02:36:01.351 --> 02:36:02.790
I love those videos.

6596
02:36:02.820 --> 02:36:04.150
Like [inaudible] videos,

6597
02:36:04.151 --> 02:36:06.540
the guys at demonstrating techniques and how they're going to work.

6598
02:36:06.541 --> 02:36:10.870
And have you seen the one where the old man who's got this a class where he

6599
02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:15.810
throws like people and then a karate Guy Pankratz guy comes in and beats the

6600
02:36:15.811 --> 02:36:16.350
shit out of me,

6601
02:36:16.350 --> 02:36:17.300
the shit out of her bed.

6602
02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:19.020
And then you see him bleed.

6603
02:36:19.021 --> 02:36:19.291
He's,

6604
02:36:19.291 --> 02:36:20.280
he's seeing himself.

6605
02:36:20.310 --> 02:36:21.360
He cannot believe it.

6606
02:36:21.430 --> 02:36:22.263
It doesn't work.

6607
02:36:22.820 --> 02:36:23.870
It's drying.

6608
02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:25.231
The one guy,

6609
02:36:25.231 --> 02:36:26.040
he does ticket ticket ticket,

6610
02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:26.873
the guy goes,

6611
02:36:27.060 --> 02:36:27.610
yeah,

6612
02:36:27.610 --> 02:36:31.220
he goes and he makes a somersault and he falls on the ground.

6613
02:36:31.221 --> 02:36:33.120
It's almost like he believed his own bullshit.

6614
02:36:33.121 --> 02:36:33.450
Right.

6615
02:36:33.450 --> 02:36:34.500
What are these guys doing?

6616
02:36:34.530 --> 02:36:35.460
They're all faking it.

6617
02:36:35.461 --> 02:36:36.720
They know they are,

6618
02:36:36.721 --> 02:36:37.890
but they're probably,

6619
02:36:37.940 --> 02:36:40.890
it's like mass hypnosis or mass hysteria,

6620
02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:41.401
you know,

6621
02:36:41.401 --> 02:36:43.020
like cult behavior.

6622
02:36:43.140 --> 02:36:44.700
They get locked into believing.

6623
02:36:44.701 --> 02:36:45.860
Like I remember when I was in,

6624
02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:46.550
um,

6625
02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:50.250
my taekwondo school was not like cultish in the sense,

6626
02:36:50.251 --> 02:36:50.990
like they,

6627
02:36:50.990 --> 02:36:52.500
nobody had to do anything crazy.

6628
02:36:52.501 --> 02:36:55.470
They didn't try to get your money or get you to leave your family or anything

6629
02:36:55.471 --> 02:36:55.861
like that,

6630
02:36:55.861 --> 02:37:00.630
but the devotion that some people had towards the instructor was a pretty crazy,

6631
02:37:00.631 --> 02:37:02.520
it's amazing and they didn't exploit it,

6632
02:37:02.700 --> 02:37:04.230
but if someone did exploited,

6633
02:37:04.470 --> 02:37:08.400
you could see how they could get some weak people that would really fall into

6634
02:37:08.401 --> 02:37:08.550
it.

6635
02:37:08.550 --> 02:37:09.120
It's,

6636
02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:11.980
it's sort of a disturbing aspect of martial arts that I went to.

6637
02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:15.540
One of the things that I really loved about Brazilian Jujitsu was that you kind

6638
02:37:15.541 --> 02:37:18.080
of see that you didn't see like all the Bowery.

6639
02:37:18.090 --> 02:37:19.290
It was more like friendly.

6640
02:37:19.490 --> 02:37:20.850
Like when I trained with the Machados like,

6641
02:37:20.851 --> 02:37:21.750
hey my friend,

6642
02:37:21.751 --> 02:37:22.584
how are you?

6643
02:37:23.010 --> 02:37:25.710
And it was much once they show you the techniques,

6644
02:37:25.740 --> 02:37:27.360
but they're very friendly and more,

6645
02:37:27.510 --> 02:37:28.343
more like,

6646
02:37:28.390 --> 02:37:29.040
like,

6647
02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:29.341
you know,

6648
02:37:29.341 --> 02:37:32.100
they don't try to place themselves above anyone.

6649
02:37:32.101 --> 02:37:36.960
There's no master this because they're going to let you know that it is really

6650
02:37:36.961 --> 02:37:40.830
effective right there and there on the respect that you get from them.

6651
02:37:40.890 --> 02:37:41.371
You'll,

6652
02:37:41.371 --> 02:37:43.170
they'll earn interest by being amazing,

6653
02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:44.850
but it's because they're good.

6654
02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:47.280
All the other guys who preach and talk about it like that,

6655
02:37:47.310 --> 02:37:47.971
they're not good.

6656
02:37:47.971 --> 02:37:48.740
They suck.

6657
02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:52.110
Like every guy who tells me that he is unbelievable,

6658
02:37:52.111 --> 02:37:53.190
but he never fought.

6659
02:37:53.250 --> 02:37:53.670
Yeah.

6660
02:37:53.670 --> 02:37:54.480
It's full of Shit.

6661
02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:54.601
Well,

6662
02:37:54.601 --> 02:37:57.200
you know how many times you told me you indeed it's not.

6663
02:37:57.201 --> 02:37:57.901
It's not possible.

6664
02:37:57.901 --> 02:37:58.650
You never,

6665
02:37:58.650 --> 02:37:59.880
he will not know.

6666
02:37:59.881 --> 02:38:01.320
If he can do it under pressure.

6667
02:38:01.321 --> 02:38:02.154
He will not.

6668
02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:03.060
It's amazing.

6669
02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:05.370
Do you know when you guys have told me though that they could never lose?

6670
02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:06.591
I never lose me.

6671
02:38:06.591 --> 02:38:07.830
You don't know about my mentality.

6672
02:38:08.490 --> 02:38:08.840
I'm in.

6673
02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:10.200
Paladin gets choked.

6674
02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:11.190
I'm like an animal,

6675
02:38:11.191 --> 02:38:11.581
Bro.

6676
02:38:11.581 --> 02:38:12.121
I'm a go.

6677
02:38:12.121 --> 02:38:16.230
Why am I go blank and then drop it?

6678
02:38:17.310 --> 02:38:18.101
I go blank.

6679
02:38:18.101 --> 02:38:18.481
Get a means.

6680
02:38:18.481 --> 02:38:19.314
You're going to think right.

6681
02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:20.490
That's the easiest.

6682
02:38:20.670 --> 02:38:23.410
<v 5>I hit named Jess coming into my class one time.</v>

6683
02:38:24.310 --> 02:38:24.960
I,

6684
02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:25.740
I'm no kidding.

6685
02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:30.740
There's a guy walking in with the stash glasses and a big belly and it Blue Blue

6686
02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:36.810
Kimono and it came in my NGO in Holland and he walked in.

6687
02:38:36.811 --> 02:38:38.640
There was six girls following him.

6688
02:38:38.641 --> 02:38:39.600
It was like a cult.

6689
02:38:39.601 --> 02:38:40.820
It was the weirdest thing ever.

6690
02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:43.300
Later on we find out he couldn't even like eight pushups.

6691
02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:44.340
It was like bizarre.

6692
02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.040
And every time when I would show something,

6693
02:38:47.340 --> 02:38:49.410
they would say something like one time,

6694
02:38:49.650 --> 02:38:50.071
you know,

6695
02:38:50.071 --> 02:38:50.520
uh,

6696
02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:52.290
I had an arm bar and this girl says,

6697
02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:52.411
oh,

6698
02:38:52.411 --> 02:38:53.640
we would buy it in the leg,

6699
02:38:53.641 --> 02:38:53.941
you know,

6700
02:38:53.941 --> 02:38:57.480
so I started slowly but surely I figure I'm not going to say anything,

6701
02:38:57.960 --> 02:38:58.830
but then you know,

6702
02:38:58.831 --> 02:38:59.490
it kept going,

6703
02:38:59.490 --> 02:39:02.440
kept going and have somebody in a rear naked choke and I said,

6704
02:39:02.460 --> 02:39:05.970
it's not going to have an explaining as she goes to somebody else.

6705
02:39:05.970 --> 02:39:06.720
She said,

6706
02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:07.450
we were buggy.

6707
02:39:07.450 --> 02:39:08.071
I said No.

6708
02:39:08.071 --> 02:39:08.530
And I go,

6709
02:39:08.530 --> 02:39:08.850
oh,

6710
02:39:08.850 --> 02:39:09.480
excuse me,

6711
02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:10.313
what was there?

6712
02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:10.940
And she said,

6713
02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:11.131
we,

6714
02:39:11.131 --> 02:39:12.990
we will poke your eyes out right now.

6715
02:39:13.170 --> 02:39:13.501
I said,

6716
02:39:13.501 --> 02:39:14.334
wow,

6717
02:39:15.270 --> 02:39:16.410
let's find out.

6718
02:39:16.530 --> 02:39:17.041
I mean,

6719
02:39:17.041 --> 02:39:18.150
I'm going to try this with you.

6720
02:39:18.151 --> 02:39:18.720
Is that cool?

6721
02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:19.201
Yeah.

6722
02:39:19.201 --> 02:39:19.651
She goes,

6723
02:39:19.651 --> 02:39:20.490
I just got to sit down.

6724
02:39:20.940 --> 02:39:21.230
I said,

6725
02:39:21.230 --> 02:39:22.320
put my arm around her neck.

6726
02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:22.701
I said,

6727
02:39:22.701 --> 02:39:23.534
okay.

6728
02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:24.331
In three,

6729
02:39:24.331 --> 02:39:25.320
six I'm going to go,

6730
02:39:25.530 --> 02:39:26.311
if you've touched my,

6731
02:39:26.311 --> 02:39:27.270
I'm going to break your neck.

6732
02:39:27.271 --> 02:39:27.600
Okay,

6733
02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:28.433
let's go.

6734
02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:29.340
She goes,

6735
02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:29.491
well,

6736
02:39:29.491 --> 02:39:29.641
what,

6737
02:39:29.641 --> 02:39:29.781
what,

6738
02:39:29.781 --> 02:39:30.331
what did she say?

6739
02:39:30.331 --> 02:39:30.930
I said,

6740
02:39:30.930 --> 02:39:33.000
in three seconds we're going to go and we'll count down.

6741
02:39:33.270 --> 02:39:34.640
You come near to my fucking,

6742
02:39:34.660 --> 02:39:35.580
I'm going to break your neck.

6743
02:39:35.581 --> 02:39:36.270
Okay,

6744
02:39:36.270 --> 02:39:36.850
I should've done,

6745
02:39:36.850 --> 02:39:37.300
what do you,

6746
02:39:37.300 --> 02:39:38.070
what do you mean?

6747
02:39:38.070 --> 02:39:38.340
I said,

6748
02:39:38.340 --> 02:39:39.080
okay.

6749
02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:39.913
You know,

6750
02:39:40.830 --> 02:39:42.180
normally when somebody touched my eye,

6751
02:39:42.181 --> 02:39:42.930
you think I'm going to go,

6752
02:39:42.930 --> 02:39:44.250
oh no,

6753
02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:47.430
I'm going to go to the top of my idol and I'm going to go.

6754
02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:50.580
Then my eye hurts.

6755
02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:52.020
That face was awesome.

6756
02:39:52.021 --> 02:39:52.690
Never,

6757
02:39:52.690 --> 02:39:56.700
never fuck with somebody who has a dominant position over you.

6758
02:39:57.030 --> 02:39:59.790
If I have you in an arm bar and you buy my calf,

6759
02:40:00.030 --> 02:40:04.230
guess what's going to break at that moment is the most idiot thing that people

6760
02:40:04.231 --> 02:40:07.230
actually believe that if you put a finger in my Ivan a lab life and death

6761
02:40:07.231 --> 02:40:07.681
situation,

6762
02:40:07.681 --> 02:40:09.000
I'm going to let go of the choke.

6763
02:40:09.030 --> 02:40:09.240
Yeah,

6764
02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:09.930
really?

6765
02:40:09.930 --> 02:40:12.570
You know I'm going to snap the neck first and I'm going to let go to church.

6766
02:40:12.630 --> 02:40:12.751
Well,

6767
02:40:12.751 --> 02:40:14.280
not only people don't understand

6768
02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:15.100
<v 0>how quick you go.</v>

6769
02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:16.490
Unconscious like,

6770
02:40:16.491 --> 02:40:16.590
well,

6771
02:40:16.590 --> 02:40:18.240
if someone has a rear naked choke on you,

6772
02:40:18.241 --> 02:40:20.110
especially if you don't really know defense.

6773
02:40:20.111 --> 02:40:21.420
He haven't been choked a lot before.

6774
02:40:21.421 --> 02:40:22.560
You don't know how to relax.

6775
02:40:22.561 --> 02:40:23.090
You don't have,

6776
02:40:23.090 --> 02:40:23.421
<v 4>oh,</v>

6777
02:40:23.421 --> 02:40:25.900
and do you know all hard it is to poke and eye.

6778
02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:26.291
Yeah,

6779
02:40:26.291 --> 02:40:27.210
it's fucking hard.

6780
02:40:29.190 --> 02:40:29.990
Very hard.

6781
02:40:29.990 --> 02:40:31.400
It's very hard to squeeze my,

6782
02:40:31.401 --> 02:40:32.234
I put my,

6783
02:40:32.300 --> 02:40:33.260
my I against your,

6784
02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:34.310
the back of your neck,

6785
02:40:34.700 --> 02:40:35.533
back of your head.

6786
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.951
<v 0>Well,</v>

6787
02:40:35.951 --> 02:40:40.951
you used to doing boss Wooten is fighting in a sport type situation where you've

6788
02:40:41.401 --> 02:40:42.550
got rules.

6789
02:40:42.730 --> 02:40:45.700
See out in the street there are no rules,

6790
02:40:45.750 --> 02:40:46.020
<v 4>you know,</v>

6791
02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:46.321
and like,

6792
02:40:46.321 --> 02:40:47.820
I cannot fight without rules to,

6793
02:40:48.220 --> 02:40:49.053
it's like,

6794
02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:51.360
I guess that by still only I can do it better,

6795
02:40:51.361 --> 02:40:52.500
more accurate as well.

6796
02:40:52.870 --> 02:40:53.290
<v 0>I,</v>

6797
02:40:53.290 --> 02:40:54.080
I used to do this,

6798
02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:55.150
I do this radio show,

6799
02:40:55.220 --> 02:40:56.440
I won't name the guy,

6800
02:40:56.441 --> 02:40:59.470
but there was a guy that they had as their body guard and he's a fucking total

6801
02:40:59.471 --> 02:41:00.310
bullshit artist.

6802
02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:05.260
And he was fucking dude with videos doing nunchucks and shit.

6803
02:41:05.261 --> 02:41:07.440
It was so stupid bastard.

6804
02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:12.220
So opie and Anthony Show and we were on the show once and this,

6805
02:41:12.221 --> 02:41:13.180
I mean I'm fine,

6806
02:41:13.181 --> 02:41:13.361
you know,

6807
02:41:13.361 --> 02:41:13.571
you,

6808
02:41:13.571 --> 02:41:14.590
you do whatever you want,

6809
02:41:14.591 --> 02:41:17.050
but as soon as you're on the air and you represent it,

6810
02:41:17.051 --> 02:41:17.560
you know,

6811
02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:18.190
I gotta,

6812
02:41:18.190 --> 02:41:19.210
I gotta tell the truth.

6813
02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:21.580
You're on the fucking radio now and people are gonna listen to you.

6814
02:41:21.700 --> 02:41:25.140
And if I let you get away with some nonsense and not,

6815
02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:25.751
not me,

6816
02:41:25.751 --> 02:41:26.081
man,

6817
02:41:26.081 --> 02:41:29.860
some young kid could it be listening to that and they want to start a martial

6818
02:41:29.861 --> 02:41:34.300
art and they get sucked into doing a stupid fucking creek street karate classes.

6819
02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:35.410
Cause I go,

6820
02:41:35.411 --> 02:41:35.890
listen,

6821
02:41:35.890 --> 02:41:36.850
it's a real simple,

6822
02:41:37.060 --> 02:41:40.720
the shit that works on trained killers is the best shit.

6823
02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:41.200
Yeah.

6824
02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:42.760
You don't see Anderson Silva,

6825
02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:43.151
you know,

6826
02:41:43.151 --> 02:41:45.130
practicing I pokes and fuck.

6827
02:41:45.180 --> 02:41:46.660
Although I pokes a pretty fucking,

6828
02:41:47.930 --> 02:41:48.490
they've worked.

6829
02:41:48.490 --> 02:41:50.770
Maybe you don't see him doing the,

6830
02:41:50.771 --> 02:41:51.320
you know,

6831
02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:53.590
a death touch and fucking,

6832
02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:54.100
you know,

6833
02:41:54.100 --> 02:41:56.410
pressure point attacks.

6834
02:41:56.411 --> 02:41:57.244
That shit doesn't work.

6835
02:41:58.340 --> 02:41:59.060
<v 4>I said on,</v>

6836
02:41:59.060 --> 02:41:59.271
on,

6837
02:41:59.271 --> 02:41:59.931
on camera,

6838
02:41:59.931 --> 02:42:01.670
we had an email from somebody who said,

6839
02:42:01.671 --> 02:42:02.470
um,

6840
02:42:02.470 --> 02:42:04.410
that his monster could,

6841
02:42:04.430 --> 02:42:06.980
but point pressure state they could knock you out.

6842
02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:08.030
I got a great story,

6843
02:42:08.031 --> 02:42:09.050
but it does also with the mirror.

6844
02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:09.831
Anyway,

6845
02:42:09.831 --> 02:42:10.820
I'd looked into gamma.

6846
02:42:10.821 --> 02:42:11.181
I said,

6847
02:42:11.181 --> 02:42:11.600
okay,

6848
02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:14.600
anybody in America you're watching right now,

6849
02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:16.600
if you have a person who gets,

6850
02:42:16.690 --> 02:42:21.260
who says that he can knock me out with a punch like it just pressing somewhere.

6851
02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:22.610
We invite him,

6852
02:42:22.611 --> 02:42:23.540
we pay him,

6853
02:42:23.570 --> 02:42:24.470
we pay his trip,

6854
02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:25.460
he can come on the show,

6855
02:42:25.461 --> 02:42:27.620
he can do it on camera on me.

6856
02:42:27.860 --> 02:42:28.820
He can knock me out.

6857
02:42:28.970 --> 02:42:31.580
I said it's a no lose situation for me because if it works,

6858
02:42:32.130 --> 02:42:33.230
I'm signing up.

6859
02:42:33.650 --> 02:42:34.850
I'm going to do that stuff.

6860
02:42:35.090 --> 02:42:36.650
But I tell you it's not going to work.

6861
02:42:36.890 --> 02:42:38.150
We had this guy with a,

6862
02:42:38.151 --> 02:42:39.430
you know a mirror Pareto,

6863
02:42:39.431 --> 02:42:40.700
you know [inaudible] my buddy.

6864
02:42:41.540 --> 02:42:45.800
We see these guys on stage and the touch guys,

6865
02:42:45.801 --> 02:42:46.460
right?

6866
02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:47.660
So one guy goes this,

6867
02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:53.270
this was the person who says they just fall back and then the guy said,

6868
02:42:53.271 --> 02:42:55.160
did you see his eyes roll back in his skull?

6869
02:42:55.550 --> 02:42:57.350
That means he was out for real.

6870
02:42:57.590 --> 02:42:59.030
So I'd go to America.

6871
02:42:59.220 --> 02:43:00.260
This is going to be fun.

6872
02:43:00.261 --> 02:43:01.970
Why is this so these guys,

6873
02:43:01.971 --> 02:43:03.700
they come walking down after the session.

6874
02:43:03.740 --> 02:43:03.951
I said,

6875
02:43:03.951 --> 02:43:04.191
okay,

6876
02:43:04.191 --> 02:43:05.690
do it good to me.

6877
02:43:06.020 --> 02:43:07.250
I want you to do it to me.

6878
02:43:07.251 --> 02:43:08.084
You want them to know couch.

6879
02:43:08.330 --> 02:43:08.780
He said,

6880
02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:09.613
are you sure about that?

6881
02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:11.160
I still do it to me.

6882
02:43:11.161 --> 02:43:11.371
I,

6883
02:43:11.371 --> 02:43:11.550
I,

6884
02:43:11.550 --> 02:43:11.851
you know,

6885
02:43:11.851 --> 02:43:12.830
I want to know how to feel.

6886
02:43:13.230 --> 02:43:13.561
And he goes,

6887
02:43:13.561 --> 02:43:13.981
you don't want to,

6888
02:43:13.981 --> 02:43:14.731
I can actually,

6889
02:43:14.731 --> 02:43:15.000
uh,

6890
02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:15.930
I got something better.

6891
02:43:15.931 --> 02:43:17.280
So we already steered away from it,

6892
02:43:17.281 --> 02:43:18.000
right?

6893
02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:18.833
So he says,

6894
02:43:19.290 --> 02:43:20.160
let me show you this.

6895
02:43:20.220 --> 02:43:21.600
And he walks over to his body,

6896
02:43:21.990 --> 02:43:26.990
they start talking to each other and then he walks away and in the corner he

6897
02:43:27.001 --> 02:43:27.661
stands like this.

6898
02:43:27.661 --> 02:43:28.494
Huh?

6899
02:43:33.780 --> 02:43:34.090
Like,

6900
02:43:34.090 --> 02:43:36.740
I mean crazy hiney run stalwarts,

6901
02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:37.420
his friend,

6902
02:43:37.420 --> 02:43:40.670
and he goes like this in midair.

6903
02:43:40.780 --> 02:43:42.910
He stops and he flies on the ground.

6904
02:43:42.940 --> 02:43:46.090
So he threw like Kung Fu forehands I didn't touch him.

6905
02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:46.953
Does it touch him?

6906
02:43:47.170 --> 02:43:47.510
I go,

6907
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:48.343
dude,

6908
02:43:48.430 --> 02:43:49.450
I'm sold.

6909
02:43:49.870 --> 02:43:50.980
Do that to me.

6910
02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:51.430
Right.

6911
02:43:51.430 --> 02:43:52.870
I'm going to take you right now.

6912
02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:54.310
So I'm going to the corner.

6913
02:43:54.311 --> 02:43:55.090
And he goes,

6914
02:43:55.090 --> 02:43:55.301
yeah,

6915
02:43:55.301 --> 02:43:57.040
but you have to be a really angry.

6916
02:43:57.490 --> 02:43:58.270
I said,

6917
02:43:58.270 --> 02:43:58.751
excuse me.

6918
02:43:58.751 --> 02:43:58.940
Yeah,

6919
02:43:58.940 --> 02:44:00.280
really angry or otherwise it won't work.

6920
02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:00.941
I say,

6921
02:44:00.941 --> 02:44:02.140
your friend just did it right.

6922
02:44:02.470 --> 02:44:02.801
I said,

6923
02:44:02.801 --> 02:44:03.010
I'm,

6924
02:44:03.010 --> 02:44:04.540
I think I can better egg then your friend.

6925
02:44:04.541 --> 02:44:04.961
Don't worry,

6926
02:44:04.961 --> 02:44:05.890
I'll be in the zone.

6927
02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:06.801
And you know Billy bill,

6928
02:44:06.801 --> 02:44:07.061
he says,

6929
02:44:07.061 --> 02:44:07.181
no,

6930
02:44:07.181 --> 02:44:07.331
no,

6931
02:44:07.331 --> 02:44:07.871
because if it,

6932
02:44:07.871 --> 02:44:09.910
if you're not real angry,

6933
02:44:10.090 --> 02:44:10.901
it doesn't work.

6934
02:44:10.901 --> 02:44:12.160
It needs to be that balance.

6935
02:44:12.161 --> 02:44:13.390
So I knew it was his way out.

6936
02:44:13.630 --> 02:44:15.610
So I walked over to him and I'm standing like this.

6937
02:44:15.611 --> 02:44:17.500
I say kick me into pills.

6938
02:44:17.770 --> 02:44:18.311
And he says what?

6939
02:44:18.311 --> 02:44:18.601
I said,

6940
02:44:18.601 --> 02:44:19.434
give me guys,

6941
02:44:19.470 --> 02:44:20.720
<v 0>I'm really fucking pissed.</v>

6942
02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:24.250
He didn't want to do it.

6943
02:44:24.251 --> 02:44:25.084
And needless to say,

6944
02:44:25.330 --> 02:44:25.631
I mean,

6945
02:44:25.631 --> 02:44:28.750
but they're idiots that truly believe that is true.

6946
02:44:29.050 --> 02:44:29.231
Well,

6947
02:44:29.231 --> 02:44:32.710
it's so easy to take someone who doesn't know anything like who's a student and

6948
02:44:32.711 --> 02:44:34.660
trick them like that and be a con man like that.

6949
02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:35.490
That,

6950
02:44:35.490 --> 02:44:36.620
<v 4>and you know what the worst thing is?</v>

6951
02:44:36.980 --> 02:44:38.030
There's teachers out there,

6952
02:44:38.031 --> 02:44:41.780
they give you a false sense of security and then they teach you how to defend a

6953
02:44:41.781 --> 02:44:42.141
knife.

6954
02:44:42.141 --> 02:44:42.351
You know,

6955
02:44:42.351 --> 02:44:43.161
grabbing the wrist.

6956
02:44:43.161 --> 02:44:43.580
I mean,

6957
02:44:43.580 --> 02:44:44.100
never did.

6958
02:44:44.100 --> 02:44:45.330
I mean it's so dangerous.

6959
02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:46.011
Life is dangerous.

6960
02:44:46.011 --> 02:44:48.780
Then a gun on a short distance at least at,

6961
02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:52.130
they teach them the wrong way and then something happens on the streets and he

6962
02:44:52.140 --> 02:44:54.680
pulls a knife and he goes to his buddy did step back.

6963
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:55.490
I got it.

6964
02:44:55.490 --> 02:44:55.750
Yeah.

6965
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:56.210
You know,

6966
02:44:56.210 --> 02:44:57.043
and they get killed.

6967
02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:59.840
<v 0>Eddie Bravo has a crazy story about that guys full.</v>

6968
02:44:59.900 --> 02:45:01.450
It's Eddie Bravo.

6969
02:45:01.451 --> 02:45:05.260
When he was first learning martial arts actually almost got into an altercation

6970
02:45:05.261 --> 02:45:06.430
before he knew Jujitsu.

6971
02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:08.140
He was first learning martial arts.

6972
02:45:08.290 --> 02:45:11.060
He really thought he was going to be able to like attack this guy and put him

6973
02:45:11.061 --> 02:45:12.640
away with some fake karate shit.

6974
02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:13.001
Yeah,

6975
02:45:13.001 --> 02:45:13.421
there you go.

6976
02:45:13.421 --> 02:45:14.030
See?

6977
02:45:14.030 --> 02:45:14.863
And he had a bad,

6978
02:45:15.060 --> 02:45:19.760
Eddie was first instructor was a fake guy and a guy said that he went to a,

6979
02:45:19.790 --> 02:45:21.640
was going to China to train with the monks.

6980
02:45:21.700 --> 02:45:22.310
Oh God,

6981
02:45:22.310 --> 02:45:22.570
we'll,

6982
02:45:22.570 --> 02:45:23.470
I'll be back in a week.

6983
02:45:23.471 --> 02:45:24.850
I'm going to China to train with amongst.

6984
02:45:24.940 --> 02:45:27.400
So Eddie was at the supermarket and saw the guys cars,

6985
02:45:27.401 --> 02:45:28.091
like what the fuck?

6986
02:45:28.091 --> 02:45:29.530
And he rented the guy at the supermarket.

6987
02:45:29.531 --> 02:45:31.200
It was supposed to be in China training.

6988
02:45:32.500 --> 02:45:33.820
What is the guy who killed her,

6989
02:45:33.821 --> 02:45:34.061
you know,

6990
02:45:34.061 --> 02:45:35.070
to fail Tori.

6991
02:45:35.100 --> 02:45:35.410
Yeah.

6992
02:45:35.410 --> 02:45:37.360
He would say that he will go into forest.

6993
02:45:37.361 --> 02:45:37.780
Yeah.

6994
02:45:37.780 --> 02:45:41.680
And he would fight the whole tournament and he would come back and yet leg these

6995
02:45:41.681 --> 02:45:44.020
bloodied up knuckles and suddenly your trophy

6996
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:46.030
story.

6997
02:45:46.030 --> 02:45:46.920
Raphael Tory,

6998
02:45:46.930 --> 02:45:48.870
his name was not really Rafael Torres.

6999
02:45:48.900 --> 02:45:49.360
Oh No,

7000
02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:49.510
no.

7001
02:45:49.510 --> 02:45:50.400
That was a fake name.

7002
02:45:50.980 --> 02:45:52.900
He was a fake Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.

7003
02:45:52.901 --> 02:45:53.830
And he had his friend,

7004
02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:55.150
Oh rob him off in the woods.

7005
02:45:55.151 --> 02:45:58.170
And I'm about to fight in a Kuma Tay Karate to,

7006
02:45:58.280 --> 02:45:59.440
to the death tournament.

7007
02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:02.620
It's so he's carrying this bag in the bag.

7008
02:46:02.621 --> 02:46:04.540
He had this fucking trophy already and it's like,

7009
02:46:04.541 --> 02:46:05.560
drop me off in the woods.

7010
02:46:05.590 --> 02:46:07.810
They're gonna meet me here and then I'm gonna fight for a couple of days and

7011
02:46:07.811 --> 02:46:08.800
I'll see you in a couple of days.

7012
02:46:08.860 --> 02:46:09.090
Yeah.

7013
02:46:09.090 --> 02:46:09.601
So then,

7014
02:46:09.601 --> 02:46:09.721
uh,

7015
02:46:09.721 --> 02:46:11.160
his friend comes back two days later,

7016
02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:11.551
pick them up.

7017
02:46:11.551 --> 02:46:11.731
Yeah,

7018
02:46:11.731 --> 02:46:12.451
I want everything.

7019
02:46:12.451 --> 02:46:13.111
Here's my trophy.

7020
02:46:13.111 --> 02:46:13.780
Like,

7021
02:46:13.780 --> 02:46:14.120
fuck,

7022
02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:15.270
are you retarded?

7023
02:46:15.271 --> 02:46:16.310
You brought that back,

7024
02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:18.180
that trophy in a bag.

7025
02:46:18.510 --> 02:46:19.081
But you know,

7026
02:46:19.081 --> 02:46:19.870
he came from that,

7027
02:46:19.870 --> 02:46:22.260
that era where you could get away with things.

7028
02:46:22.980 --> 02:46:23.811
<v 4>People believe that.</v>

7029
02:46:23.811 --> 02:46:26.540
I have a lot of guys who believe stuff,

7030
02:46:26.570 --> 02:46:26.931
you know,

7031
02:46:26.931 --> 02:46:29.360
it's the cover of magazines and they,

7032
02:46:29.361 --> 02:46:31.490
they're this and their that and they're nobodies.

7033
02:46:31.730 --> 02:46:32.780
Absolutely nobody's,

7034
02:46:32.781 --> 02:46:34.820
but people believe and directors believe that,

7035
02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:35.160
oh yeah,

7036
02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:35.511
here you go.

7037
02:46:35.511 --> 02:46:35.961
Oh my God,

7038
02:46:35.961 --> 02:46:37.560
this guy man is dangerous weight.

7039
02:46:38.230 --> 02:46:39.820
<v 0>Galls golf claims.</v>

7040
02:46:40.690 --> 02:46:42.670
Did you see the interview he did with Michael Chavela?

7041
02:46:42.830 --> 02:46:43.650
<v 4>Oh No,</v>

7042
02:46:43.650 --> 02:46:45.050
they're less in your face.

7043
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:46.641
The thing is this,

7044
02:46:46.641 --> 02:46:47.474
the thing is this,

7045
02:46:47.690 --> 02:46:48.620
here I go back here.

7046
02:46:48.621 --> 02:46:49.400
I go back to,

7047
02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:50.240
did you ever compete?

7048
02:46:50.270 --> 02:46:50.720
No,

7049
02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:50.841
no.

7050
02:46:50.841 --> 02:46:51.171
But I,

7051
02:46:51.171 --> 02:46:53.900
I trained her without a guy should we would fight in Dojo.

7052
02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:58.340
We all know that finding in a Dojo and fighting under pressure in the cage or in

7053
02:46:58.341 --> 02:46:58.581
a ring,

7054
02:46:58.581 --> 02:46:59.300
whatever,

7055
02:46:59.300 --> 02:47:01.340
you cannot even compare to each other.

7056
02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:04.550
I always explain to my buddy Amir press always would say it.

7057
02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:04.900
You know,

7058
02:47:04.900 --> 02:47:05.930
if you take a two by four,

7059
02:47:05.931 --> 02:47:07.220
like a long 20 foot long,

7060
02:47:07.490 --> 02:47:07.820
right,

7061
02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:08.201
and you,

7062
02:47:08.201 --> 02:47:09.530
you have to walk over it,

7063
02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:10.760
it's an easy thing to do.

7064
02:47:10.761 --> 02:47:11.581
You just walk over.

7065
02:47:11.581 --> 02:47:12.440
It's 20 feet long now.

7066
02:47:12.441 --> 02:47:16.010
He put that same bar up about two buildings,

7067
02:47:16.011 --> 02:47:16.970
20 stories up,

7068
02:47:16.971 --> 02:47:18.590
and now you have to walk over there.

7069
02:47:18.770 --> 02:47:21.650
Now it's a whole different ballgame and it's not so easy anymore.

7070
02:47:21.651 --> 02:47:24.410
Now that's the same as if fighting and sparring.

7071
02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:27.010
Nothing compared how many Dojo fighters,

7072
02:47:27.020 --> 02:47:27.853
you know,

7073
02:47:27.860 --> 02:47:28.610
that terror.

7074
02:47:28.610 --> 02:47:30.800
Everybody including the professionals.

7075
02:47:30.801 --> 02:47:32.420
But when they find themselves,

7076
02:47:32.450 --> 02:47:33.830
they can't find their panic.

7077
02:47:34.300 --> 02:47:37.130
And that's what I always say until you never,

7078
02:47:37.131 --> 02:47:37.411
you,

7079
02:47:37.411 --> 02:47:38.244
you it,

7080
02:47:38.300 --> 02:47:39.230
you can never tell.

7081
02:47:39.350 --> 02:47:40.220
You can have a hundred blame,

7082
02:47:40.221 --> 02:47:40.761
but I don't care.

7083
02:47:40.761 --> 02:47:41.180
I'll go.

7084
02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:42.230
I got to see it.

7085
02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:43.130
I got to see you fight.

7086
02:47:43.131 --> 02:47:44.480
I don't believe people saying that.

7087
02:47:44.481 --> 02:47:45.260
You're good.

7088
02:47:45.260 --> 02:47:49.370
I want to see you fight none of training under pressure with people around.

7089
02:47:49.450 --> 02:47:50.283
<v 0>So,</v>

7090
02:47:50.380 --> 02:47:51.213
