<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

83
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I used to listen to it when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivering newspapers.</v>

84
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Norman had a theory that was proven</v>

85
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that a prince,</v>

86
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:40.804
<v Speaker 1>when he died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he died of the last of the eighties </v>

87
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he's been fighting it hard cause</v>

88
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>of the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he got it back actually fucked up.</v>

89
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.660
<v Speaker 1>He died from fentanyl man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all died from that fentanyl shit.</v>

90
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.563
<v Speaker 1>That stuff kills everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're testing drugs now at music </v>

91
00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:58.804
<v Speaker 1>festivals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should that and they did it in </v>

92
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:01.924
<v Speaker 1>Australia when I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it in UK in some places where </v>

93
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:05.494
<v Speaker 1>you just come and they chip off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>smallest amount and they text you get </v>

94
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>your stuff is safe or not and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>way safer to do it.</v>

95
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Then just fucking passing around fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need deregulation.</v>

96
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>They just do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just need deregulation.</v>

97
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>You're not saving anybody by making </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs illegal.</v>

98
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>You're just making it difficult to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>good drugs.</v>

99
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.453
<v Speaker 1>That's all you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not stopping people from doing </v>

100
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 1>drugs and in fact when they legalize </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

101
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 1>often teen use goes down because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't become so attractive anymore,</v>

102
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>but people are stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

103
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>we are wired fucked up and you can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>us we can't do something.</v>

104
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing we want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it is.</v>

105
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fair,</v>

106
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>I will say legalization of drugs would </v>
<v Speaker 1>make more people do it.</v>

107
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 1>I would have to think it would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically they say no when they've</v>

108
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.200
<v Speaker 1>done studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody though.</v>

109
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.250
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally do and be like,</v>

110
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a store right there.</v>

111
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

112
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that man.</v>

113
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:55.084
<v Speaker 1>I think it normalizes after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it starts off like that in the </v>

114
00:04:57.821 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think what that is is the residual</v>

115
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 1>effect of making it pro prohibited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the residual effect.</v>

116
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.520
<v Speaker 1>But then once it becomes legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like alcohol,</v>

117
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 1>if you're 21 you don't walk by cvs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

118
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 1>I could just go buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't I just go get some whiskey?</v>

119
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

120
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.610
<v Speaker 1>but people way more people drink than </v>
<v Speaker 1>two drugs.</v>

121
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't do it because it's like a</v>

122
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to get it.</v>

123
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 1>It's just there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sad.</v>

124
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.153
<v Speaker 1>You got to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people that would never would have </v>

125
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:26.224
<v Speaker 1>done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have conservative friends from high </v>

126
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:29.670
<v Speaker 1>school that never would do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it was on the same levels,</v>

127
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>alcohol in 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll be like,</v>

128
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.221
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

129
00:05:32.221 --> 00:05:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I was my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all my friends are doing it.</v>

130
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really just not worst.</v>

131
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:37.354
<v Speaker 1>I won't say it's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying there's some people who </v>

132
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:40.870
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think overall you end up getting a</v>

133
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:43.530
<v Speaker 1>lot less people like total numbers to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it well.</v>

134
00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I think things would normalize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

135
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 1>I think we have a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

136
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a responsibility that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>society has to,</v>

137
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:54.670
<v Speaker 1>this fucked up prohibition that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>know is ridiculous.</v>

138
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 1>We have too much information now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know too much about people</v>

139
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.023
<v Speaker 2>to make things prohibited when you make </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things that are just as dangerous </v>

140
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:01.761
<v Speaker 2>legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

141
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 2>so it's all fucking farce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

142
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.773
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When alcohol is legal and marijuana </v>

143
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:06.810
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or alcohol's legal,</v>

144
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking nonsense.</v>

145
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 2>People drink themselves to death every </v>
<v Speaker 2>day to death every day,</v>

146
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 2>not just liver effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol poisoning.</v>

147
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 2>Thousands of people every year die from </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol poisoning.</v>

148
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do mushrooms that much.</v>

149
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 2>You can't die from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

150
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:25.270
<v Speaker 2>but it will just stop working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't do it.</v>

151
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep doubling the dosage.</v>

152
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.423
<v Speaker 2>By the end of the week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be doing like a pound of </v>

153
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

154
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do that.</v>

155
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Your shit's will be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

156
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Dennis Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I had on last week,</v>

157
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:38.864
<v Speaker 2>his brother terrance had that theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>about human evolution and it's a very </v>

158
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 2>compelling theory and there's firms make</v>
<v Speaker 2>human ability.</v>

159
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.933
<v Speaker 2>They might have caused it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it might've been one of several </v>

160
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 2>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was several factors.</v>

161
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:50.744
<v Speaker 2>One of them was climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the monkeys had to move down from </v>

162
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:53.474
<v Speaker 2>the trees because there was no food left</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the grasslands had taken over where </v>

163
00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 2>the rain forest had been cause just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of climate change.</v>

164
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.150
<v Speaker 2>But that was the same period where all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these undulates lift.</v>

165
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 2>So all of these cow like creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit all over the place.</v>

166
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.210
<v Speaker 2>The mushrooms growing out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these monkeys that were experimental,</v>

167
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:09.044
<v Speaker 2>the human monkey started eating these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and then started developing </v>

168
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 2>language skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more sophisticated hunting,</v>

169
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 2>better visual because the visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>perception,</v>

170
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 2>especially in low doses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually increases acuity been proven</v>

171
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 2>in scientific double blind placebo </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled studies.</v>

172
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

173
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Speaker 2>It increases visual cues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increases your ability to recognize when</v>

174
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:29.324
<v Speaker 2>things are shifting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you have two lines and one </v>

175
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:31.544
<v Speaker 2>of them slightly shifts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe a half of 1% angle that </v>

176
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 2>people that were on mushrooms could see </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

177
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 2>You ever see a clock or be able to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in a hand move,</v>

178
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.013
<v Speaker 2>like get zoned in where you can like </v>
<v Speaker 2>slow sort of see it move in a couple of </v>

179
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:43.100
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only because when I was little,</v>

180
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

181
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:45.980
<v Speaker 2>that's what that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

182
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 2>we can like my vision sucks now dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I look at a clock,</v>

183
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:53.060
<v Speaker 2>I look at like vague numbers like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that clock right now.</v>

184
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Like I look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little one right there.</v>

185
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at,</v>

186
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Speaker 2>those are vague numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't see those.</v>

187
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I can see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's 12 months to close.</v>

188
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:02.840
<v Speaker 2>That's Peter went out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

189
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I could see all the dots.</v>

190
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 2>I could see everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the surgery.</v>

191
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that.</v>

192
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's close.</v>

193
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 2>It's near sightedness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what happens when you get older.</v>

194
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 2>It's just macular degeneration.</v>

195
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.980
<v Speaker 2>This is too near for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

196
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.110
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that are near don't look as good.</v>

197
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like a good medium distance,</v>

198
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:22.670
<v Speaker 2>but farther things look exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

199
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 2>It's a slow degeneration of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyesight due to age.</v>

200
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 2>My friend was not remembering my friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Graham,</v>

201
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 2>he's an ophthalmologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

202
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:32.240
<v Speaker 2>there's not a goddamn thing you can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

203
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Doctor Steve with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

205
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:37.483
<v Speaker 2>He told me some great advice I will </v>
<v Speaker 2>share with everyone we were talking </v>

206
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:42.200
<v Speaker 2>about on my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking with him about um,</v>

207
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 2>the hours they put in and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're putting a 10 hours,</v>

208
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:48.700
<v Speaker 2>you can't be as good at four 30 as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are because,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

216
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 1>let's start dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this guy,</v>

217
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matthew Walker on a couple of weeks ago.</v>

218
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 1>It was a sleep specialist and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about how important sleep is.</v>

219
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.253
<v Speaker 1>And one thing in common with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that suffer from Alzheimer's is </v>

220
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 1>they were getting like three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four hours sleep at night.</v>

221
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.770
<v Speaker 1>They were those get up and go type </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

222
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.373
<v Speaker 1>Their brains wind up short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's saying that really sleep is </v>

223
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those podcasts,</v>

224
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:26.550
<v Speaker 1>you listen to it and it literally will </v>
<v Speaker 1>change your behavior patterns.</v>

225
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we're changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my behavior does slip so fucking much.</v>

226
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.990
<v Speaker 1>I just stay in bed for like five hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>after I wake up and what's,</v>

227
00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 1>what's the point you live in the life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ours fear and a lot of ways if it's cold</v>

228
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

269
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't tell me you were going and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you vanish for a few months,</v>

270
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I would call the police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would?</v>

271
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I would worry about you.</v>

272
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.180
<v Speaker 1>But once you tell me like I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to Asia,</v>

273
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:12.610

276
00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:18.030
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happens if you get arrested?</v>

277
00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do the time,</v>

<v Speaker 1>embassy maybe,</v>

280
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.090

<v Speaker 1>but if you just vanished,</v>

281
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.313
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for people that care </v>

282
00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:27.714
<v Speaker 1>about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to hurt their feelings </v>

<v Speaker 1>but they just have to deal with it.</v>

287

292
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:46.231

<v Speaker 1>you can't not tell me where you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not be able to reach you.</v>

296
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:52.830
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it makes you feel better,</v>

297

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That does make me feel better.</v>

299
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 2>There's something to what you did </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

300
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.303
<v Speaker 2>I think it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt you felt like a little different </v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

303
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Like you had just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

304
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:09.760
<v Speaker 2>you'd had so many experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everything fades away.</v>

305
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Responsibility was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading this book,</v>

306
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.020
<v Speaker 2>the talent code,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever heard of it?</v>

307
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.340
<v Speaker 2>It's a really interesting book where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they analyze performers and different,</v>

308
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.880
<v Speaker 2>different venues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like different things that they do.</v>

309
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.670
<v Speaker 2>Different sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different art.</v>

310
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jackson's who?</v>

311
00:12:27.811 --> 00:12:28.644
<v Speaker 2>Greg Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing book I think for anybody and it </v>

312
00:12:32.221 --> 00:12:35.520
<v Speaker 2>makes you really realize first of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>how many sets you should be doing.</v>

313
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.640
<v Speaker 2>He should be doing a ton of long sets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As many law.</v>

314
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.340
<v Speaker 2>The most time on stage you have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

315
00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:42.563
<v Speaker 2>It's very critical like the longer long </v>
<v Speaker 2>sets because an hour like you're going </v>

316
00:12:46.311 --> 00:12:48.870
<v Speaker 2>to perform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're headlining the most you can do</v>

317
00:12:48.871 --> 00:12:51.840
<v Speaker 2>those the better because you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

318
00:12:51.841 --> 00:12:54.810
<v Speaker 2>That's a different thing when you do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>weekend,</v>

319
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.240
<v Speaker 2>don't you feel like if you do Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday,</v>

320
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.000
<v Speaker 2>Saturday at a comedy club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday night late show you are fucking</v>

321
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:00.843
<v Speaker 2>colliding</v>

322
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.773
<v Speaker 3>fire and if I do like the third straight</v>
<v Speaker 3>week of five show weekends by then it's </v>

323
00:13:07.381 --> 00:13:08.370
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you guys are getting it right.</v>

324
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful show right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you just get smooth?</v>

325
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I the one of the smoothest I ever got </v>

326
00:13:13.681 --> 00:13:18.210
<v Speaker 2>was I did that a maxim tour with Charlie</v>
<v Speaker 2>Murphy and half Ron and dude,</v>

327
00:13:18.211 --> 00:13:20.550
<v Speaker 2>we did 22 dates in a month or we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

328
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.720
<v Speaker 2>oh we just go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like in this zen state,</v>

329
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.910
<v Speaker 2>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing so much stand up.</v>

330
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.370
<v Speaker 3>That's how I come back from Edinburgh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

331
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just 25 straight days of an hour and</v>

332
00:13:31.771 --> 00:13:32.604
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you're like,</v>

333
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.013
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to tweak it a little when you </v>

334
00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:36.960
<v Speaker 3>get home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like it's just like you're there,</v>

335
00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:38.820
<v Speaker 3>you're just doing it over and over again</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the way.</v>

336
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.190
<v Speaker 3>I think in the beginning of standup when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're starting,</v>

337
00:13:41.191 --> 00:13:42.024
<v Speaker 3>I think lots of sets are good cause then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you learn how to win over a crowd a </v>

338
00:13:44.581 --> 00:13:45.414
<v Speaker 3>bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So three new crowds is better than one </v>

339
00:13:47.581 --> 00:13:49.620
<v Speaker 3>45 minutes to completely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then yeah,</v>

340
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:51.050
<v Speaker 3>once you're doing it longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like</v>

341
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.473
<v Speaker 2>look at it like form your hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this is what I was getting to with </v>

342
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:55.580
<v Speaker 2>that talent code book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

343
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.513
<v Speaker 2>It is on development of skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just talking about how many amazing </v>

344
00:13:58.841 --> 00:13:59.674
<v Speaker 2>Brazilian soccer players came out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this one area and they were trying to </v>

345
00:14:01.901 --> 00:14:04.480
<v Speaker 2>figure it out and they realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh it was,</v>

346
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:06.970
<v Speaker 2>they have this other game that they play</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a smaller,</v>

347
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:07.804
<v Speaker 2>heavier ball and it's harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they do that game and it's like </v>

348
00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 2>in clothes co they'll do it in like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

349
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.170
<v Speaker 2>like a small room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this room.</v>

350
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.123
<v Speaker 2>They'll play the soccer game and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>get amazing footwork and movement </v>

351
00:14:18.341 --> 00:14:20.410
<v Speaker 2>because that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're in such close quarters,</v>

352
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:21.550
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very fast.</v>

353
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.210
<v Speaker 2>And so they take those skills and apply </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to soccer,</v>

354
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Speaker 2>football,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they call it.</v>

355
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.440
<v Speaker 2>And it's fucking amazing how much they </v>
<v Speaker 2>excel.</v>

356
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.380
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm talking to some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those roasts battle guys.</v>

357
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.533
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always rose pedal cars and you </v>

358
00:14:34.431 --> 00:14:35.330
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not like,</v>

359
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.480
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

360
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.360
<v Speaker 3>as developed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on stage as they are for those rose</v>

361
00:14:40.361 --> 00:14:40.821
<v Speaker 3>petals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

362
00:14:40.821 --> 00:14:42.670
<v Speaker 3>But some of them like Joe Dosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like that,</v>

363
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:44.590
<v Speaker 3>the kill [inaudible] when those roles </v>
<v Speaker 3>paddles.</v>

364
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.480
<v Speaker 3>So then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

365
00:14:46.481 --> 00:14:50.270
<v Speaker 3>So it's talking to Eli Sayers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's like unified champ and a,</v>

366
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.820
<v Speaker 2>we figured out like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just take those,</v>

367
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.833
<v Speaker 2>those rows style jokes and applied them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the guy next to you and traffic or </v>

368
00:14:57.201 --> 00:14:58.580
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you've really just,</v>

369
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.670
<v Speaker 2>just roasting any topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

370
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.420
<v Speaker 2>that comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you just got to leave.</v>

371
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.260
<v Speaker 2>That should eventually yet no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

372
00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.380
<v Speaker 2>I think there's good training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cross training.</v>

373
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

374
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.083
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's things like that with </v>

375
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:10.700
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think with you,</v>

376
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.260
<v Speaker 2>what I was recognized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

377
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.153
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just sorta like data crunched all </v>

378
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:18.790
<v Speaker 2>these cultures over four months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you came back with like you,</v>

379
00:15:18.791 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 2>you had like last patience for stupidity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

380
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 2>and more like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more expanded,</v>

381
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.943
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

382
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:29.183
<v Speaker 2>to how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to gauge someone's </v>

383
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:32.750
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way you talked about things,</v>

384
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 2>I was like had a more expanded view of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things you like,</v>

385
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:36.800
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

386
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.840
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just America,</v>

387
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:39.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your perspective is like you got </v>

388
00:15:40.911 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 2>everybody who thinks that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word you crazy.</v>

389
00:15:42.951 --> 00:15:46.040
<v Speaker 2>This is just America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We spend so much time in this bubble,</v>

390
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.260
<v Speaker 2>but when you are out there for like four</v>
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

391
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 2>you came back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like you were like,</v>

392
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.410
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

393
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.453
<v Speaker 2>And I think as a human is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is one of the things </v>

394
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:58.040
<v Speaker 2>that happens bad to comedians when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>become successful,</v>

395
00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.450
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reasons why they </v>
<v Speaker 2>drop off.</v>

396
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.433
<v Speaker 2>They get really famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really powerful because they don't take </v>

397
00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:03.674
<v Speaker 2>any new experiences in because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't take any risks because too many </v>

398
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:08.000
<v Speaker 2>people like them when they go on stage.</v>

399
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I know that played in your own crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His crowd is terrible,</v>

400
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:13.190
<v Speaker 2>but also play to your own crowd is your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fault.</v>

401
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Here's why you should know if your stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>is good and you should be working on it,</v>

402
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.980
<v Speaker 2>you should be listening to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>recordings.</v>

403
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:19.873
<v Speaker 2>You should listen to them and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this something that I would want to </v>

404
00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:23.370
<v Speaker 2>pay to see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

405
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.223
<v Speaker 2>and if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me fix it because like I'm in this </v>

406
00:16:27.151 --> 00:16:27.984
<v Speaker 2>stage right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right and new act stage where Max </v>

407
00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:31.184
<v Speaker 2>terrible right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still have the old material that I'll </v>

408
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:37.580
<v Speaker 2>have to abandon when a October comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the special airs,</v>

409
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.570
<v Speaker 2>but until then I'm just developing shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the new stuff.</v>

410
00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:42.404
<v Speaker 2>It's like I've got six new minutes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are worth hearing and they'll a lot of </v>

411
00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:50.180
<v Speaker 2>stuff fucking super clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't do it,</v>

412
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.660
<v Speaker 2>if you don't scare yourself and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't experience new things,</v>

413
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.673
<v Speaker 2>you don't have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to know whether your stuff's </v>

414
00:16:57.441 --> 00:16:58.274
<v Speaker 2>any good.</v>

415
00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>

416
00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:01.790
<v Speaker 2>if you're not looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not paying attention,</v>

417
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.720
<v Speaker 2>it happens to a lot of famous comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their specials as they get older,</v>

418
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:07.400
<v Speaker 2>get softer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>softer,</v>

419
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.253
<v Speaker 2>softer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

420
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.093
<v Speaker 2>and there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinison was always my favorite example </v>

421
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.400
<v Speaker 2>because he's one of my all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If not,</v>

422
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.100
<v Speaker 2>he's like prior and Kennison to me are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

423
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.140
<v Speaker 2>that's my mount rushmore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

424
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.330
<v Speaker 2>in Lenny Bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just for creating the whole thing.</v>

425
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.910
<v Speaker 2>But I have an idea I want to talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>about like,</v>

426
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.753
<v Speaker 2>I forgot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you watch early kinison he was </v>

427
00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:28.430
<v Speaker 2>a fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best.</v>

428
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Who's the best?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was such a short time,</v>

429
00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:33.740
<v Speaker 2>but with him it wasn't like a sustained </v>
<v Speaker 2>success to drop.</v>

430
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:34.850
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

431
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:36.080
<v Speaker 2>he went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went crazy.</v>

432
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:40.160
<v Speaker 2>He's hanging out with Bon Jovi and doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>blow and bang and strippers.</v>

433
00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:40.994
<v Speaker 2>And being that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's being that rockstar comedian guy </v>

434
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.473
<v Speaker 2>and he didn't write anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could tell he was getting by on </v>

435
00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:47.540
<v Speaker 2>songs and dances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

436
00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:50.370
<v Speaker 2>He was just like show business of </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

437
00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Remember the todd?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

438
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he went crazy.</v>

439
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the todd got me into the store.</v>

440
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.131
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

441
00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 1>He's the reason I got into the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told me how to do it too.</v>

442
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 1>And you told me you're going to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your friends.</v>

443
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Sit next to Mitzi and when your friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>on stage,</v>

444
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:06.060
<v Speaker 1>you laugh hard and Mitzi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go along with you.</v>

445
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh did he did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sat right next to Mitzi.</v>

446
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.281
<v Speaker 1>Mitzi goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

449
00:18:12.981 --> 00:18:15.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just sort of believed that and I got</v>

450
00:18:15.381 --> 00:18:16.940
<v Speaker 1>lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a great set and then,</v>

451
00:18:16.941 --> 00:18:19.000
<v Speaker 1>but the todd was probably the loudest </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice in the room.</v>

452
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.490
<v Speaker 1>He was in the back laughing his ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

453
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.493
<v Speaker 1>I do that for anybody that I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did it from required for whatever </v>

454
00:18:24.651 --> 00:18:26.090
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody if you're,</v>

456
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Mitzi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to sit next to Mitzi.</v>

457
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.733
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to sit next to her where my </v>

458
00:18:32.371 --> 00:18:35.330
<v Speaker 1>friends would showcase just so these </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking cock blocks wouldn't come in and</v>

460
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.093
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing in the middle of </v>

461
00:18:39.501 --> 00:18:42.170
<v Speaker 1>sets?</v>

<v Speaker 1>There was no point.</v>

485
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.063
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just trying to perform and ride </v>

486
00:19:37.201 --> 00:19:39.900
<v Speaker 1>the wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the beginning he was angry.</v>

487
00:19:39.901 --> 00:19:41.670
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so angry.</v>

488
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.833
<v Speaker 1>They asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come you don't make fun of men as </v>

489
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 1>much to make fun of women?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

490
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.640
<v Speaker 1>because a man has never born and make me</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive my car into a tree.</v>

491
00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:50.730
<v Speaker 1>He used to play that song.</v>

492
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:55.830
<v Speaker 4>I want my fucking records back by rap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God help you.</v>

493
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:57.380
<v Speaker 4>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Under a gas truck.</v>

494
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it was good.</v>

495
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believed it.</v>

496
00:20:03.591 --> 00:20:04.850
<v Speaker 1>He was just short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

497
00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:09.350
<v Speaker 1>ugly guy who was just screaming at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world for all of his pain.</v>

498
00:20:09.351 --> 00:20:12.110
<v Speaker 1>You knew he was in pain and then when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't in pain anymore,</v>

499
00:20:12.111 --> 00:20:14.660
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he wasn't in pain anymore.</v>

500
00:20:14.661 --> 00:20:15.494
<v Speaker 1>That he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just this superstar and then it </v>

501
00:20:17.661 --> 00:20:19.880
<v Speaker 1>just didn't work as a superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

502
00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:20.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying a lot of these guys </v>

503
00:20:21.681 --> 00:20:25.520
<v Speaker 1>don't enter into new experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have new challenges,</v>

504
00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.290
<v Speaker 1>new experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be excited,</v>

505
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.553
<v Speaker 1>be excited about some new thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that much like these </v>

506
00:20:32.721 --> 00:20:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian soccer players from what does </v>
<v Speaker 1>named Daniel coyle is who we are.</v>

507
00:20:36.591 --> 00:20:38.990
<v Speaker 1>What's the author's name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel coyle.</v>

508
00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.093
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he talked about these Brazilian </v>

509
00:20:41.301 --> 00:20:44.450
<v Speaker 1>soccer players playing this tight room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the skills they developed in this really</v>

510
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.740
<v Speaker 1>tight environment help them in the game.</v>

511
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I think life is like what the training </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground for standup is.</v>

512
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:54.490
<v Speaker 1>And if your life is the same boring shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling your agent,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what do we got for me?</v>

<v Speaker 1>You really can't talk about that </v>

00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:01.894
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's boring and people don't relate to </v>

517
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:03.784
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people could.</v>

518
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Kathy Griffin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all she talks about.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would you talk to to try to explain </v>

564
00:22:25.151 --> 00:22:28.570
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is maybe a thousand of us on earth</v>

565
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.400
<v Speaker 1>artists know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you talk about like how many </v>

569
00:22:36.431 --> 00:22:39.670
<v Speaker 1>headliners are there on earth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a thousand?</v>

570
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.210
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking cruise ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

572
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.780

<v Speaker 1>special right.</v>

573
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:46.783
<v Speaker 1>Someone who comedy central would watch </v>

<v Speaker 1>So that's not a lot of people.</v>

576
00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a shit small amount of people for </v>

578
00:23:01.211 --> 00:23:03.730
<v Speaker 1>well why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is this a small amount of people?</v>

579
00:23:03.731 --> 00:23:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a bloody fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe leading up to success.</v>

580
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:13.660
<v Speaker 1>There's no chance of money early on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even a chance and go and go,</v>

581
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:14.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

582
00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:15.244
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you on a fast track is going to be </v>

583
00:23:16.451 --> 00:23:18.810
<v Speaker 1>seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're on the fat side,</v>

584
00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.820
<v Speaker 1>if you're on the fast track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it ain't around the corner dude.</v>

585
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:22.893
<v Speaker 1>And you're subject to bombing and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>jump off a bridge bombing at any one of </v>

586
00:23:26.891 --> 00:23:27.430
<v Speaker 1>those years.</v>

587
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jump off a bridge about the cult.</v>

588
00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:32.020
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to explain to them what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold sweats where and how.</v>

589
00:23:32.021 --> 00:23:33.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

590
00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:36.040
<v Speaker 1>almost like out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel the sweat but it's,</v>

591
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:39.730
<v Speaker 1>you're shivering at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Y'All was the worst for me laying in bed</v>

592
00:23:39.731 --> 00:23:41.920
<v Speaker 1>at night after the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you're going over it.</v>

593
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Everything went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrenching.</v>

594
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond embarrassing him.</v>

595
00:23:50.051 --> 00:23:50.884
<v Speaker 1>It's beyond embarrassment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just ruthless destruction of your self </v>

596
00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:56.660
<v Speaker 1>esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Ah,</v>

597
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.780
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

598
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.080
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that just won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>go back after that.</v>

599
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you that's uh,</v>

600
00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:03.810
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

601
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory not what's before theory,</v>

602
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:10.040
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I haven't proven it all.</v>

603
00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.003
<v Speaker 1>Why there's fewer women in stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause my friend who's a researcher's </v>

604
00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:17.060
<v Speaker 1>like women's Development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rachel Simmons swings books on it.</v>

605
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said that women just,</v>

606
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget it,</v>

607
00:24:21.811 --> 00:24:22.644
<v Speaker 1>but sociologically or physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably sociologically or less able to </v>

608
00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:27.890
<v Speaker 1>accept rejection early on.</v>

609
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.570
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't go with it who they are.</v>

610
00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:30.693
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they just like don't do those </v>

611
00:24:32.781 --> 00:24:34.160
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to push them.</v>

612
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:34.994
<v Speaker 1>If you have daughters you have to push </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to like try and fail and try and </v>

613
00:24:36.681 --> 00:24:37.514
<v Speaker 1>fail because failure makes you succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But early on in stand up it's only </v>

614
00:24:40.941 --> 00:24:42.070
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

615
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:46.340
<v Speaker 1>so if your gender's less into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's taking that like outside rejection</v>

616
00:24:46.341 --> 00:24:47.930
<v Speaker 1>or something and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I don't want to do this.</v>

617
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.073
<v Speaker 1>We didn't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sexist is fuck and after denounce you </v>

618
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:52.730
<v Speaker 1>now publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>

619
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.593
<v Speaker 1>I have to go on twitter and tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody your supporting gender </v>

620
00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:58.123
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes say it definitely met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have forced women to not be able to </v>

621
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:02.054
<v Speaker 1>accept rejection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put them in this category where they </v>

622
00:25:03.441 --> 00:25:04.940
<v Speaker 1>can't accept projection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

623
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Which proves that when men and women are</v>
<v Speaker 1>equal,</v>

624
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:10.423
<v Speaker 1>so when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now when they've been socialized by a </v>

625
00:25:13.221 --> 00:25:14.054
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy to not accept that they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they go into an environment where </v>

626
00:25:16.701 --> 00:25:18.860
<v Speaker 1>it's only failure and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this.</v>

627
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:19.783
<v Speaker 1>I think if I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think standup is at least 20 to 25% </v>

628
00:25:23.751 --> 00:25:24.584
<v Speaker 1>harder for women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I think there's subjects </v>

629
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.510
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're starting out,</v>

630
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.850
<v Speaker 1>men don't want to hear from you in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

631
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.133
<v Speaker 1>Men Don't want to hear about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a bigger hurdle when it comes </v>

632
00:25:36.561 --> 00:25:39.590
<v Speaker 1>to points of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics or advice.</v>

633
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Anything where a woman is like saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a guy who can get on stage and say,</v>

634
00:25:43.281 --> 00:25:44.114
<v Speaker 1>listen guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to fucking get your life in </v>

635
00:25:46.281 --> 00:25:48.200
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to stop Blah Blah button.</v>

636
00:25:48.201 --> 00:25:49.034
<v Speaker 1>Then the jokes set up and then go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a woman would have a hard time </v>

637
00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:53.390
<v Speaker 1>giving advice given by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

638
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.233
<v Speaker 1>I can see that did buy meatheads right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If let's say this might be true because </v>

639
00:25:57.051 --> 00:25:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say young comics,</v>

640
00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.670
<v Speaker 1>the stock make a gender actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young comics talking about politics,</v>

641
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:02.390
<v Speaker 1>what's got to change?</v>

642
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:03.223
<v Speaker 1>A part of me goes like 26 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment goes shut the fuck up so you </v>

643
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:06.590
<v Speaker 1>don't know what the fuck you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

644
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:10.460
<v Speaker 1>So anyone 26 would have to deal with and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think women have that shit too.</v>

645
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have like,</v>

646
00:26:11.341 --> 00:26:12.174
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear this from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they have that deep into their </v>

647
00:26:13.941 --> 00:26:14.774
<v Speaker 1>thirties and forties because men don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to hear it from chicks about </v>

648
00:26:16.251 --> 00:26:17.270
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

649
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.490
<v Speaker 1>let me go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She fucking wish Hillary won.</v>

650
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Jesus starts a shocker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

651
00:26:21.891 --> 00:26:24.010
<v Speaker 1>there's like this gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

652
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:28.790
<v Speaker 1>like biases that a lot of men have about</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman getting onstage talking,</v>

653
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.070
<v Speaker 1>controlling all the attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like it.</v>

654
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.180
<v Speaker 1>And I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of men have the,</v>

655
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's right or wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just I,</v>

656
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.650
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just being honest about </v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts.</v>

657
00:26:36.651 --> 00:26:39.080
<v Speaker 1>There's an instinct to not like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

658
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.230
<v Speaker 1>There's another reason too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that,</v>

659
00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taylor's theory,</v>

660
00:26:43.681 --> 00:26:44.450
<v Speaker 1>which I like,</v>

661
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:46.790
<v Speaker 3>is it women on stage early on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

662
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.673
<v Speaker 3>this is why it's harder for men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the first six months or so </v>

663
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:49.913
<v Speaker 3>women just the first six months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women are used to people looking at </v>

664
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:53.424
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for men it's this weird new thing </v>

665
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.420
<v Speaker 3>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why you looking at me as strange?</v>

666
00:26:57.421 --> 00:27:00.180
<v Speaker 3>Showing the first like right away and </v>
<v Speaker 3>open mics like early on,</v>

667
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.080
<v Speaker 3>women are way more comfortable on stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the men.</v>

668
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.310
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the most part and then that it evens</v>

669
00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:06.144
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those first few months it's this </v>

670
00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 3>thing of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

671
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.600
<v Speaker 3>this is not a comfortable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women,</v>

672
00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:10.653
<v Speaker 3>it's a negative that I've had to deal </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that their whole lives but like </v>

673
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:12.863
<v Speaker 3>people are staring at them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we struggle with this idea of </v>

674
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like saying that I think it's harder for</v>

675
00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:22.170
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's harder for men because it's</v>

676
00:27:22.171 --> 00:27:25.250
<v Speaker 3>a generalization to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like overall some hard,</v>

677
00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.130
<v Speaker 3>it's harder for that.</v>

678
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:27.420
<v Speaker 3>Some men it's where he's report </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

679
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:28.763
<v Speaker 3>That's when the black and white it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's when you fucking ruined all the </v>

680
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:33.510
<v Speaker 3>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's just like 10% harder,</v>

681
00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:34.344
<v Speaker 3>15% owner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the reasons it is harder </v>

682
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:42.500
<v Speaker 3>careerwise for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean almost all women is because uh,</v>

683
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:45.930
<v Speaker 3>success too early can hurt you in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>long run.</v>

684
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.140
<v Speaker 3>If you start thinking I'm good instead </v>
<v Speaker 3>of thinking you're terrible,</v>

685
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:52.380
<v Speaker 3>you don't work as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just human nature thing.</v>

686
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.573
<v Speaker 3>More for women than for men because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in such a category of needing </v>

687
00:27:57.241 --> 00:27:58.074
<v Speaker 3>women performers that we go earlier and </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier in development in order to plug </v>

688
00:28:00.811 --> 00:28:01.890
<v Speaker 3>them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

689
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.500
<v Speaker 3>Because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I need to put a woman on stage on TV,</v>

690
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>

691
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this developed women Silverman.</v>

692
00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:11.900
<v Speaker 3>It's like I ain't doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to Saguaros.</v>

693
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:12.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

694
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

695
00:28:13.531 --> 00:28:14.364
<v Speaker 3>so you have to get some women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have chemisch show somebody </v>

696
00:28:16.051 --> 00:28:17.880
<v Speaker 3>at home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own the version of yourself.</v>

697
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:18.733
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if there's women viewers got to put </v>

698
00:28:20.011 --> 00:28:20.960
<v Speaker 3>a woman on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

699
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a lot of comics,</v>

700
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.440
<v Speaker 3>but if I'm getting this as a single </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual performer,</v>

701
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.660
<v Speaker 3>if I'm getting something five years in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I start going,</v>

702
00:28:27.661 --> 00:28:28.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty fucking good.</v>

703
00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:30.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to work this hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

704
00:28:30.151 --> 00:28:31.560
<v Speaker 3>when I start getting more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

705
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:32.483
<v Speaker 3>I work less and less hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's another reason why the fucking </v>

706
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.870
<v Speaker 3>celebrity comics aren't as good as non </v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrity comics.</v>

707
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you start getting stuff,</v>

708
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.553
<v Speaker 3>you start like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to work that hard to get </v>

709
00:28:42.631 --> 00:28:43.464
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have to study for an hour to get </v>

710
00:28:44.731 --> 00:28:46.230
<v Speaker 3>an a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

711
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.970
<v Speaker 3>Then why would you study for seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours?</v>

712
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.620
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An hour gets you there.</v>

713
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.830
<v Speaker 3>So if you start getting success career </v>
<v Speaker 3>wise,</v>

714
00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:56.700
<v Speaker 3>like monetarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stop working as hard on the artistic</v>

715
00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:57.210
<v Speaker 3>part of it.</v>

716
00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:58.560
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can stop.</v>

717
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.423
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

718
00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:00.121
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

719
00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:01.830
<v Speaker 3>I think you're 100% right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

720
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.693
<v Speaker 3>So this is the drop off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sorta does them a disservice as he </v>

721
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:09.570
<v Speaker 3>has an individual that gets stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time you want to,</v>

722
00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.150
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a former booker,</v>

723
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.003
<v Speaker 3>as a booker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you gotta do is look harder to get </v>

724
00:29:15.151 --> 00:29:17.250
<v Speaker 3>qualified women go to Indianapolis Five </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ms Pat,</v>

725
00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:18.693
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to prop somebody up who doesn't </v>

726
00:29:21.721 --> 00:29:23.760
<v Speaker 3>quite deserve it only hurts them in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>long run.</v>

727
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:24.923
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the problem also is that you </v>

728
00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:29.274
<v Speaker 3>want to find a certain number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like comedy should be almost totally </v>

729
00:29:32.581 --> 00:29:33.660
<v Speaker 3>egalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

730
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:37.200
<v Speaker 3>It should be just performance based.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

731
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:38.243
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if a club has a developmental </v>

732
00:29:39.391 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 3>project,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Wendy does the works in Denver,</v>

733
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.160
<v Speaker 1>than it might not be a bad idea to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>all girl classes.</v>

734
00:29:45.161 --> 00:29:45.994
<v Speaker 1>I bet that would give you a bump for </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who feels uncomfortable and </v>

735
00:29:49.781 --> 00:29:50.614
<v Speaker 1>wants to learn how to do standup with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all one of those is harder for for </v>

736
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.830
<v Speaker 1>checks early on is because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>crepes and open mikes.</v>

737
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not weeded out like there aren't</v>

738
00:29:58.891 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 1>clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clubs there was like,</v>

739
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.110
<v Speaker 1>get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want you here.</v>

740
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I'd open my any fucking freak that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

741
00:30:03.641 --> 00:30:04.474
<v Speaker 1>And Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not a fun experience to deal </v>

742
00:30:06.131 --> 00:30:06.964
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think that drives around </v>

743
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.830
<v Speaker 1>with the most right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Early on.</v>

744
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

745
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's good.</v>

746
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:15.550
<v Speaker 1>And then also I got this fucking smelly </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy fucking leering over me.</v>

747
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:16.893
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A hundred percent a hundred percent I </v>

748
00:30:18.971 --> 00:30:21.670

<v Speaker 1>creepiness plus crazy people.</v>

749
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.160

<v Speaker 1>creepiness,</v>

750
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.670
<v Speaker 1>and then you have open mikes.</v>

751
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Just always a certain percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are insane.</v>

752
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:29.950
<v Speaker 1>It's literally insane.</v>

<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

810
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Let's do louder than hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know louder than hell?</v>

811
00:32:53.621 --> 00:32:55.370
<v Speaker 1>You can't get on CD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

812
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Cause it was so homophobic that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people at Warner brothers,</v>

813
00:32:58.611 --> 00:32:59.444
<v Speaker 1>they put it out on a cassette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they never released it on cd </v>

814
00:33:02.841 --> 00:33:05.390
<v Speaker 1>when cds came along and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that fat slob.</v>

815
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's gonna Forget.</v>

817
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you how much she had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome.</v>

818
00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I was around during the pc days of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties were in a pc war.</v>

819
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like it's just a battlefield.</v>

820
00:33:18.471 --> 00:33:19.304
<v Speaker 1>It's just gone crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's more bombs going off pc </v>

821
00:33:21.111 --> 00:33:21.944
<v Speaker 1>wise and ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are so invested in the idea of </v>

822
00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:26.120
<v Speaker 1>controlling behavior and telling people </v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>

823
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.350
<v Speaker 1>But back then it was happening too for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while with the,</v>

824
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.030
<v Speaker 1>with the member,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music,</v>

825

<v Speaker 1>Al Gore's wife,</v>

826
00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.910
<v Speaker 1>his wife was trying to make it a speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some things that go too far.</v>

827
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah she was trying to ban rap music and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so things got things got real weird.</v>

828
00:33:43.311 --> 00:33:44.144
<v Speaker 1>Same language over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MTV banned dice clay for life cause he </v>

829
00:33:47.991 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 1>told some joke about girls and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>periods or something.</v>

830
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I would love to hear what that joke was </v>
<v Speaker 1>and see if we can actually like that's a</v>

831
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:59.630
<v Speaker 1>goddamn badge of courage for a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 1>dice just gave him a gold medal.</v>

832
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.360
<v Speaker 1>That's all it really does for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

833
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:03.223
<v Speaker 1>That guy legitimately doesn't give a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck cause like I was definitely going </v>

834
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:06.870
<v Speaker 1>to be good anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll,</v>

835
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.823
<v Speaker 1>he walks around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes videos walking around the </v>

836
00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:12.500
<v Speaker 1>supermarket talking about his haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this new hair cut.</v>

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.420
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

838
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:17.030
<v Speaker 1>This fucking haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy doesn't give a fuck.</v>

839
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Like literally it's just doing whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>dice wants to do.</v>

840
00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Wandering through the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with his kids.</v>

841
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:24.463
<v Speaker 1>So like for him like getting banned from</v>
<v Speaker 1>MTV was probably the greatest thing </v>

<v Speaker 5>Shane up Ho Bitch.</v>

864
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 5>That</v>

865
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.020
<v Speaker 2>was the weirdest kind of comedy that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do it.</v>

866
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.260
<v Speaker 2>They knew what you were going to say and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to hear it start calming.</v>

867
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.640
<v Speaker 2>A complete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>original,</v>

868
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.833
<v Speaker 2>complete original.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just like people look at him </v>

869
00:35:47.401 --> 00:35:47.791
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

870
00:35:47.791 --> 00:35:52.080
<v Speaker 2>brutish and disgusting and dirty jokes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and misogynist.</v>

871
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:53.363
<v Speaker 2>All those things are true but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to realize that he </v>

872
00:35:55.861 --> 00:35:56.694
<v Speaker 2>revolutionized like he did something but</v>
<v Speaker 2>he broke through some weird rock star </v>

873
00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

874
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.090
<v Speaker 2>if you just look at it completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>objectively,</v>

875
00:36:06.091 --> 00:36:07.800
<v Speaker 2>forget about the artistic merits of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>

876
00:36:07.801 --> 00:36:08.634
<v Speaker 2>He did something very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He figured out a way to do comedy that </v>

877
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:12.924
<v Speaker 2>people legitimately laughed at even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though they knew it was coming that </v>

878
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.890
<v Speaker 2>hadn't been done before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hadn't been dealt with like that.</v>

879
00:36:19.891 --> 00:36:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

880
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.450
<v Speaker 2>No one yells out the punchlines in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the whole crowd.</v>

881
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.820
<v Speaker 2>What's in the bow bitch.</v>

882
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.000
<v Speaker 2>He needed the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

883
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.800
<v Speaker 2>everybody wanted to hear the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had already said,</v>

884
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.693
<v Speaker 2>which never existed before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can fucking tour with that original </v>

885
00:36:38.251 --> 00:36:41.580
<v Speaker 2>act right now and people would be super </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfied,</v>

886
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.610
<v Speaker 2>let's say along with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dice,</v>

887
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.110
<v Speaker 2>get to 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>seat arenas with that original act.</v>

888
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.080
<v Speaker 2>What's in the bow bench has not much to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go crazy.</v>

889
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Nothing comedy wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

890
00:36:51.211 --> 00:36:53.980
<v Speaker 2>It's the opposite of regular comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the hair there,</v>

891
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.490
<v Speaker 2>but not much crushers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Machine thing.</v>

892
00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he forces that on people.</v>

893
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I saw Gaffigan and at moontower once and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did 45 minutes.</v>

894
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.230
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was great and he does the old stuff.</v>

895
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he was like,</v>

896
00:37:08.221 --> 00:37:09.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he introduced it like that.</v>

897
00:37:09.481 --> 00:37:09.871
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

898
00:37:09.871 --> 00:37:11.340
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably just go back to my hotel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Roman.</v>

899
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:15.180
<v Speaker 2>When I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I say burt forces on people,</v>

900
00:37:15.181 --> 00:37:15.960
<v Speaker 2>let me explain what I'm saying.</v>

901
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Like he like that's his signature thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean it like in a negative way,</v>

902
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.980
<v Speaker 2>but I mean like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's scared to not do that.</v>

903
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:24.083
<v Speaker 2>He wants to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants them to know him as that </v>

904
00:37:25.431 --> 00:37:26.264
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to do that bit everywhere and </v>

905
00:37:27.751 --> 00:37:29.490
<v Speaker 2>he feels like they get upset if he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't do it.</v>

906
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.720
<v Speaker 2>So in his head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's,</v>

907
00:37:31.721 --> 00:37:32.554
<v Speaker 2>he's forcing it on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore seeing on him and it's like </v>

908
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.333
<v Speaker 2>he's developed this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows that if you're a fan of </v>

909
00:37:37.411 --> 00:37:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Bert Kreischer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the bit,</v>

910
00:37:38.491 --> 00:37:41.280
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says you want to see this?</v>

911
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:42.900
<v Speaker 2>But he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to see them?</v>

912
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.360
<v Speaker 2>And then he's so worried about them </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting upset that they don't hear it,</v>

913
00:37:45.361 --> 00:37:49.230
<v Speaker 2>but he's not at all concerned with how </v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel about him pledging $10,000</v>

914
00:37:49.231 --> 00:37:51.000
<v Speaker 2>a children's hospital and not doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

915
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Just our food in the pantry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>

916
00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you brought that up.</v>

917
00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:01.830
<v Speaker 2>One of the best trolls of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>him on children's hospital at gray.</v>

918
00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.213
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

919
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:04.703
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about your job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that that's a different </v>

920
00:38:08.641 --> 00:38:11.160
<v Speaker 2>thing when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have a bit like a signature bit</v>

921
00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:13.890
<v Speaker 2>that you do every time you go on stage </v>

928
00:38:27.511 --> 00:38:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Bobby Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's just goofy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

931
00:38:33.241 --> 00:38:35.070
<v Speaker 2>I just like seeing this over and over</v>

932
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:37.870
<v Speaker 5>in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boston,</v>

933
00:38:37.871 --> 00:38:40.090
<v Speaker 5>like all the headliners would do the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same act forever.</v>

934
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.650
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I fuck all them.</v>

935
00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.440
<v Speaker 5>Well that's why it fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

936
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:44.060
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

937
00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 5>Only only lasted for a little while like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

938
00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.310
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

939
00:38:48.311 --> 00:38:50.080
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you haven't written a case up.</v>

940
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Speaker 5>They had the opposite of an Internet age</v>
<v Speaker 5>approach.</v>

941
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.980
<v Speaker 5>Their age approach was you put together </v>
<v Speaker 5>a 45 minutes sat and that's it.</v>

942
00:38:56.981 --> 00:38:59.170
<v Speaker 5>And some of them literally only had 45 </v>
<v Speaker 5>minutes.</v>

943
00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:02.120
<v Speaker 5>They'd been doing comedy for decades </v>
<v Speaker 5>because even with dice,</v>

944
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.540
<v Speaker 5>let's say you compare that to music </v>
<v Speaker 5>where everyone's singing along with it.</v>

945
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:05.823
<v Speaker 5>Musicians have new albums and then you </v>
<v Speaker 5>expand that catalog of stuff you can </v>

946
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:11.790
<v Speaker 5>sing along with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hopefully up to a point up to a point.</v>

<v Speaker 5>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want you to react to it,</v>

967
00:39:53.801 --> 00:39:54.634
<v Speaker 5>but there's such a different thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>between feeling something and then </v>

968
00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:02.980
<v Speaker 5>forcing everyone around you to hear it </v>

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:41.080
<v Speaker 2>They just look creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a nightmare.</v>

1154
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:41.973
<v Speaker 2>A little nothing legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a thing that was in North </v>

1155
00:47:44.951 --> 00:47:47.890
<v Speaker 2>America millions of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least 1 million,</v>

1156
00:47:47.891 --> 00:47:50.200
<v Speaker 2>I think they were called terror birds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1157
00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 2>oh creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing is terror birds.</v>

1158
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:57.130
<v Speaker 2>They were an enormous seven feet tall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1159
00:47:57.190 --> 00:48:00.010
<v Speaker 2>enormous birds and some of them were </v>
<v Speaker 2>even bigger than that.</v>

1160
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:00.933
<v Speaker 2>That we're a predatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're flightless birds to lived in </v>

1161
00:48:03.971 --> 00:48:05.440
<v Speaker 2>North America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

1162
00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:05.981
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1163
00:48:05.981 --> 00:48:06.814
<v Speaker 2>like a big foot size bird that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably be eat people shine huge beats </v>

1164
00:48:11.741 --> 00:48:12.574
<v Speaker 2>like beats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll literally consume half your </v>

1165
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:17.440
<v Speaker 2>abdomen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were these freaky fucking animals,</v>

1166
00:48:17.441 --> 00:48:18.274
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a bigger one even before </v>

1167
00:48:19.661 --> 00:48:21.840
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one that dwarf that too.</v>

1168
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:24.100
<v Speaker 2>That was a millions of years ago.</v>

1169
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:26.410
<v Speaker 2>See you find that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite thing.</v>

1170
00:48:26.411 --> 00:48:27.244
<v Speaker 2>When they did time travel and they go </v>
<v Speaker 2>back into prehistoric times and its </v>

1171
00:48:28.961 --> 00:48:30.100
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like fuck,</v>

1172
00:48:30.101 --> 00:48:32.050
<v Speaker 2>everything here will kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

1173
00:48:32.051 --> 00:48:34.990
<v Speaker 2>God has nowhere to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw Jurassic world yesterday.</v>

1174
00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.250
<v Speaker 2>How was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

1175
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.233
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely some cut the shit </v>

1176
00:48:38.291 --> 00:48:40.450
<v Speaker 2>moments where it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't lie,</v>

1177
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:41.303
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have those to make one of </v>

1178
00:48:42.461 --> 00:48:44.050
<v Speaker 2>those movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to appreciate movies.</v>

1179
00:48:44.051 --> 00:48:46.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm just dumb fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what they looked like.</v>

1180
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that fucking thing.</v>

1181
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.863
<v Speaker 2>So that was running around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a North American animal </v>

1182
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:54.380
<v Speaker 2>to that looks like it was running up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the car look.</v>

1183
00:48:54.381 --> 00:48:55.214
<v Speaker 2>So it's chasing after elk and shit but </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's look it go to the upper right </v>

1184
00:48:57.641 --> 00:49:00.400
<v Speaker 2>hand drawing the upper right hand one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shows you how big they were.</v>

1185
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:03.550
<v Speaker 2>They were fucking enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1186
00:49:03.551 --> 00:49:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Way better than human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.090
<v Speaker 2>And then there was ones that were even </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger than that.</v>

1188
00:49:07.091 --> 00:49:07.924
<v Speaker 2>Those are the two biggest ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked this one because they put the </v>

1189
00:49:09.521 --> 00:49:12.130
<v Speaker 2>human like the outline of the human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's holding a machine gun.</v>

1190
00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Fire them off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She imagined that thing run.</v>

1191
00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Even if you had a machine gun and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

1192
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got an and running.</v>

1193
00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:20.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how many of them there were </v>

1194
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.930
<v Speaker 2>different kinds of enormous birds that </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant ostriches and shit.</v>

1195
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1196
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.390
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1197
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:29.283
<v Speaker 2>that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The really big one that's in the </v>

1198
00:49:30.761 --> 00:49:31.594
<v Speaker 2>foreground with that reddish beak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a fucking creepy thing that would </v>

1199
00:49:34.811 --> 00:49:35.644
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're walking through a field and </v>

1200
00:49:36.581 --> 00:49:41.500
<v Speaker 2>you saw this nine foot plus tall freaky </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass bird staring at you,</v>

1201
00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.870
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't even fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>

1202
00:49:43.871 --> 00:49:45.880
<v Speaker 2>it's just an armless eating machine.</v>

1203
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can call it a bird,</v>

1204
00:49:47.621 --> 00:49:49.810
<v Speaker 2>but they can't fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have any wings.</v>

1205
00:49:49.811 --> 00:49:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're weird.</v>

1206
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:55.240
<v Speaker 2>They have giant talents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they are as a fucking dinosaur.</v>

1207
00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:56.163
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some weird ass dinosaur that </v>

1208
00:49:58.991 --> 00:50:02.680
<v Speaker 2>made it to a 2018 you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a big theory.</v>

1209
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's being debated amongst the birds are</v>

1210
00:50:05.381 --> 00:50:06.214
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1211
00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:07.203
<v Speaker 2>They really think that it's quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible that a lot of those dinosaurs </v>

1212
00:50:09.521 --> 00:50:10.850
<v Speaker 2>had feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:12.760
<v Speaker 2>I became birds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are birds.</v>

1214
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all over their body.</v>

1215
00:50:14.171 --> 00:50:15.940
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we look at a t rex,</v>

1216
00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:17.440
<v Speaker 2>he might've been covered in feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1217
00:50:17.441 --> 00:50:18.620
<v Speaker 2>that would've been cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1218
00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.840
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know.</v>

1219
00:50:19.841 --> 00:50:20.674
<v Speaker 2>Some of them definitely were though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're finding some of them covered in </v>

1220
00:50:23.171 --> 00:50:25.510
<v Speaker 2>feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These mikes are great.</v>

1221
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:27.620
<v Speaker 2>They're not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still picks you up like way back.</v>

1222
00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Little</v>

1223
00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:29.290
<v Speaker 5>pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not,</v>

1224
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:31.280
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't pick up too much bullshit in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the background.</v>

1225
00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:34.430
<v Speaker 5>We've tried other ones that like pick up</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit in the background too much.</v>

1226
00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:36.890
<v Speaker 5>Like if you moved some things over here </v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be too loud.</v>

1227
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:37.783
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1228
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:38.743
<v Speaker 5>some of them are Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can explain what are the ones that </v>

1229
00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:41.474
<v Speaker 5>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they literally pick up every sound in </v>

1230
00:50:42.411 --> 00:50:43.244
<v Speaker 5>the room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pickup pattern and whatnot at the </v>

1231
00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:48.110
<v Speaker 5>preamp on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This isn't up very loud.</v>

1232
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.370
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's up loud,</v>

1233
00:50:49.371 --> 00:50:50.300
<v Speaker 5>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

1234
00:50:50.301 --> 00:50:51.134
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this Mike needs a preamp because it has </v>

1235
00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:53.354
<v Speaker 5>a very low nominal level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't know what that means at </v>

1236
00:50:56.091 --> 00:50:56.924
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am in podcasting and I have no idea </v>

1237
00:50:58.461 --> 00:51:01.000
<v Speaker 5>what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Famous dropping some audio knowledge.</v>

1238
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:03.410
<v Speaker 5>I just want a bike to be able to do the </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing where you talk,</v>

1239
00:51:03.411 --> 00:51:05.510
<v Speaker 5>like you're in a car driving by a line </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you're like,</v>

1240
00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:06.693
<v Speaker 5>hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe later we'll go to the store and </v>

1241
00:51:07.551 --> 00:51:09.280
<v Speaker 5>then we'll get that sound.</v>

1242
00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.470
<v Speaker 5>Does that sound I supposed to sound like</v>
<v Speaker 5>the jobs off debt with a pan.</v>

1243

<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1245
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 5>but you'd have to do that with software.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't be doing that with just the</v>

1246
00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:20.300
<v Speaker 5>microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We and not with just the microphone.</v>

1247
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:21.793
<v Speaker 5>That's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where do you think you would fucking </v>

1248
00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.790
<v Speaker 5>getting the line and you'd like yell </v>
<v Speaker 5>something at them,</v>

1249
00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:27.390

<v Speaker 5>the window and yell.</v>

1278
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:30.253
<v Speaker 5>He's real good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's more than anybody like refused to </v>

1279
00:52:32.541 --> 00:52:33.374
<v Speaker 5>accept that he's famous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he just like walks around normal and </v>

1280
00:52:35.091 --> 00:52:36.170
<v Speaker 5>then people will start barking.</v>

<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they kind of like goes away.</v>

1282
00:52:37.641 --> 00:52:40.490
<v Speaker 5>But like he just goes in a normal </v>
<v Speaker 5>environments all the time.</v>

1283
00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.990
<v Speaker 5>He's a good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really is really good guy.</v>

1284
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:48.230
<v Speaker 5>He is not making 20,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20.</v>

1285
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No Way.</v>

1286
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:53.900
<v Speaker 5>He has no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no desire to quit.</v>

1287
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:55.490
<v Speaker 5>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's riding it out.</v>

1288
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:57.560
<v Speaker 5>Did he quit for a while?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1289
00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:59.180
<v Speaker 5>I think every once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really know.</v>

1290
00:52:59.181 --> 00:53:02.060
<v Speaker 5>I think every once in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he gets cleaned from ray,</v>

1291
00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.040
<v Speaker 5>but it's like he doesn't really white,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just wants to cut,</v>

1292
00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:04.953
<v Speaker 5>pull it back a little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes he's never gonna be one of </v>

1293
00:53:07.161 --> 00:53:07.871
<v Speaker 5>those guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1294
00:53:07.871 --> 00:53:09.290

<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

1295
00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's interested in that.</v>

1296
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.860
<v Speaker 5>He's enjoying himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what Mitch Hedberg said before he</v>

1297
00:53:15.861 --> 00:53:17.720
<v Speaker 5>died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently they're trying to get them to</v>

1298
00:53:17.721 --> 00:53:18.321
<v Speaker 5>clean up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1327
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:27.203
<v Speaker 5>so when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was having some pretty good thoughts </v>

1328
00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.560
<v Speaker 5>on this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Acid watches from different paths of the</v>

1329
00:54:30.561 --> 00:54:32.150
<v Speaker 5>killers by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking killed him.</v>

1330
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:34.440
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1331
00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:35.893
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see stuff in like when you're out </v>

1332
00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:38.581
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a dog.</v>

1333
00:54:38.581 --> 00:54:39.414
<v Speaker 5>So a truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I call them universal truths where you </v>

1334
00:54:41.101 --> 00:54:42.390
<v Speaker 5>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1335
00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:43.800
<v Speaker 5>that is real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is right.</v>

1336
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:44.813
<v Speaker 5>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's hard to bring that shit back </v>

1337
00:54:46.771 --> 00:54:48.390
<v Speaker 5>into this realm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1338
00:54:48.391 --> 00:54:49.224
<v Speaker 5>to understand it and trying to get us </v>
<v Speaker 5>kicked off of youtube that it's passing </v>

1339
00:54:53.971 --> 00:54:54.804
<v Speaker 5>car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's hard when you come back to be </v>

1340
00:54:56.231 --> 00:54:56.521
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1341
00:54:56.521 --> 00:54:59.730
<v Speaker 5>I saw the truth of something and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you can't express it.</v>

1342
00:54:59.731 --> 00:55:01.110
<v Speaker 5>And when people come back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they're around you,</v>

1343
00:55:01.111 --> 00:55:02.520
<v Speaker 5>they say something and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1344
00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:04.350
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they realize I get frustrated.</v>

1345
00:55:04.351 --> 00:55:05.440
<v Speaker 5>They're not saying it right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1346
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.170
<v Speaker 5>And then it's slowly going away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1347
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:08.783
<v Speaker 5>So when I was there in that place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I try to remember like when </v>

1348
00:55:13.421 --> 00:55:15.250
<v Speaker 5>you get back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say this to this person,</v>

1349
00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:21.300
<v Speaker 5>so that state told me to tell you m and </v>
<v Speaker 5>m is one of the real estate amps is</v>

1350
00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:26.590
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1351
00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:30.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to argue with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what exactly,</v>

1352
00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:35.710
<v Speaker 5>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does that could be a funny bit,</v>

1353
00:55:35.711 --> 00:55:37.150
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a funny bit in there,</v>

1354
00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:40.690
<v Speaker 5>like about how like some things are just</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the moment.</v>

1355
00:55:40.691 --> 00:55:44.220
<v Speaker 5>They seem so profound.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So rob,</v>

1356
00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:46.180
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parking lot,</v>

1390
00:56:55.931 --> 00:56:56.764
<v Speaker 1>but the various different groups have </v>
<v Speaker 1>different labels maybe would have taken </v>

1391
00:57:01.061 --> 00:57:03.490
<v Speaker 1>that put up their own guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called keeping it street.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got a boner for old cars,</v>

00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:25.331
<v Speaker 1>Do you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1424
00:58:25.331 --> 00:58:26.950
<v Speaker 1>that that rap would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

1425
00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:27.813
<v Speaker 1>I forgot who it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like saying from the white </v>

1426
00:58:29.171 --> 00:58:32.200
<v Speaker 1>point of view about what the form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>black people and then from a black point</v>

1427
00:58:32.201 --> 00:58:35.640
<v Speaker 1>of view as far with white people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>video is somebody like lips.</v>

1428
00:58:35.641 --> 00:58:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I can pretty well something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like redneck dude.</v>

1429
00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:39.433
<v Speaker 1>It's like black people always complained</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this and this and then it goes </v>

1430
00:58:41.171 --> 00:58:42.010
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1431
00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I forgot who it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young something.</v>

1432
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.273
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with black people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white people is that people say black </v>

1433
00:58:49.391 --> 00:58:51.270
<v Speaker 1>people and white just people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1434
00:58:51.350 --> 00:58:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Instead of just people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching this video,</v>

1435
00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:54.903
<v Speaker 1>it's annoying video of this lady calling</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's everything's in the right place.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The white lady is overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just angry looking like you're </v>

<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she out here calling the police on a </v>

<v Speaker 1>Like she's not being horrible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything just fell into place to this </v>

<v Speaker 1>like perfect example of like what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening here?</v>

1449
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:43.483
<v Speaker 1>Like is this racism or is this someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's just just complains about </v>

1450
00:59:47.481 --> 00:59:48.314
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which she be doing that for an eight </v>

1451
00:59:49.341 --> 00:59:50.380
<v Speaker 1>year old little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1452
00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.253
<v Speaker 1>That's why I hear the argument a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you wouldn't do this if it was a </v>

1453
00:59:53.181 --> 00:59:54.860
<v Speaker 1>man you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a woman you want to go,</v>

1454
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:55.400
<v Speaker 1>this was black.</v>

1455
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.500
<v Speaker 1>But it's like you're not basing on what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next set of,</v>

1456
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:59.870
<v Speaker 1>it's just like one example for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One example,</v>

1457
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.640
<v Speaker 1>well you're not pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no proof.</v>

1458
01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:04.850
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't have done that eight year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old White Hills Chamber of commerce.</v>

1459
01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.280
<v Speaker 1>And whenever somebody wanted to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeding,</v>

1460
01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.570
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sidewalk seating,</v>

1461
01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:09.404
<v Speaker 1>they had to get through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all it would take is one housewife </v>

1462
01:00:11.391 --> 01:00:15.110
<v Speaker 1>from the area to get a stick up their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass about the rules and say no,</v>

1463
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:17.390
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it'll be done by 8:00</v>

1464
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>PM there won't be any hurt on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the people around us when lean up.</v>

1465
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:22.910
<v Speaker 1>And if she goes no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1466
01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:26.180
<v Speaker 1>it's like 24 more hoops to jump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1467
01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.193
<v Speaker 1>And it's just because he's housewives </v>
<v Speaker 1>have nothing to do better than new </v>

1468
01:00:29.661 --> 01:00:33.020
<v Speaker 1>enforce rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it could be that could be fucked.</v>

1469
01:00:33.021 --> 01:00:34.190
<v Speaker 1>These black kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1470
01:00:34.191 --> 01:00:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any idea.</v>

1471
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>She was on the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on an interview talking about it,</v>

1472
01:00:38.661 --> 01:00:39.494
<v Speaker 1>which is a terrible idea by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The white lady and she put all this </v>

1473
01:00:42.261 --> 01:00:44.350
<v Speaker 1>makeup on and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also a terrible,</v>

1474
01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>but mimi from drew carey show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just not good.</v>

1475
01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:47.641
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

1476
01:00:47.641 --> 01:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>And went with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You carry right.</v>

1477
01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:51.020
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1478
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:52.063
<v Speaker 1>but the whole thing was she was saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she was working and that she had </v>

1479
01:00:56.391 --> 01:00:57.224
<v Speaker 1>the window open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little girl was shouting and </v>

1480
01:00:58.461 --> 01:00:59.294
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was trying to make it look bad as </v>

1481
01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:01.780
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1482
01:01:01.781 --> 01:01:02.614
<v Speaker 1>She was a victim and she said she </v>
<v Speaker 1>apologized to both the little girl and </v>

1483
01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.770
<v Speaker 1>the mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they won't accept her apology,</v>

1484
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.263
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1485
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:10.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1486
01:01:10.001 --> 01:01:11.630
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with accepting </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's apology.</v>

1487
01:01:11.631 --> 01:01:12.464
<v Speaker 1>Clearly she shouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he shouldn't tell a little eight </v>

1488
01:01:14.721 --> 01:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>year old and not sell water on a hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1489
01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.293
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that doesn't make any [inaudible] </v>

1490
01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:20.061
<v Speaker 1>just going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1492
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:23.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe she was saying that it was a </v>

1493
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.790
<v Speaker 1>hot day and so she had her window rolled</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1494
01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>The kid was screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently she didn't talk to them.</v>

1495
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.750
<v Speaker 1>She didn't talk to the kid and she </v>

<v Speaker 1>the worst position to be in in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1512
01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.540
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely work to do there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>supposed to.</v>

1526
01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.301
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1527
01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get to that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>without a permit?</v>

1529
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:58.200
<v Speaker 1>I got a discussion with someone at </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter way back about that guy,</v>

1530
01:02:58.201 --> 01:03:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Michael Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't breathe.</v>

1531
01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.313
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Brown?</v>

1532
01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Eric Garner was Eric Garner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1533
01:03:05.330 --> 01:03:06.180
<v Speaker 1>And somebody is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1534
01:03:06.181 --> 01:03:08.750
<v Speaker 1>What's your understand is I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>business and like I sell it.</v>

1535
01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.593
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I sell cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm somebody undercutting me with no </v>

1536
01:03:11.281 --> 01:03:13.260
<v Speaker 1>permits right outside that really hurts </v>
<v Speaker 1>my business.</v>

1537
01:03:13.261 --> 01:03:13.741
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

01:03:13.741 --> 01:03:14.574
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you that.</v>

1539
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the punishment for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be choking someone?</v>

1540
01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe till I can't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

1541
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:20.701
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1542
01:03:20.701 --> 01:03:22.400
<v Speaker 1>That's too much of a punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1543
01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1544
01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:23.843
<v Speaker 1>Well here's the problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The official version of that is that he </v>

1545
01:03:28.441 --> 01:03:31.260
<v Speaker 1>didn't have any cigarettes on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did not know he had nothing.</v>

1546
01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.750
<v Speaker 1>He had nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1547
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:33.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1548
01:03:33.181 --> 01:03:35.820
<v Speaker 1>he had nothing when they had arrested </v>
<v Speaker 1>him before for that,</v>

1549
01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.240
<v Speaker 1>but he was clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all have cigarettes.</v>

1550
01:03:39.241 --> 01:03:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Who's telling him leave him the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone?</v>

1551
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.050
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y'all was out here.</v>

1552
01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Fuck with me.</v>

1553
01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Just leave me the fuck alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started by wanting to frisk him and</v>

1554
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.240
<v Speaker 1>there was for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1555
01:03:47.241 --> 01:03:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I've been sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just one sentence is still too much.</v>

1556
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:50.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just give me the ticket bit.</v>

1557
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't touch them.</v>

1558
01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wasn't a violent guy,</v>

1559
01:03:53.671 --> 01:03:56.000
<v Speaker 1>wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like threatening them and some sort of a</v>

1560
01:03:56.001 --> 01:03:56.790
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1561
01:03:56.790 --> 01:03:59.970
<v Speaker 1>and then they tried to say that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a chokehold pitch.</v>

1562
01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Let me put you in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I pass by the two cops that I wanted</v>

1563
01:04:03.091 --> 01:04:03.924
<v Speaker 1>to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>one was sec right after that in New York</v>

1565
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:07.040
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a choke hold.</v>

1566
01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:08.160
<v Speaker 1>And I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to stop and go,</v>

1567
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.113
<v Speaker 1>actually I'm friends with an expert on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject and he does say that </v>

1568
01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.160
<v Speaker 1>chocolate chip called a choking to death</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will choke you to death with that.</v>

1570
01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.240

<v Speaker 1>And he's got his hands grip that is like</v>

1571
01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.193
<v Speaker 1>the same vr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a backwards version of what you </v>

1572
01:04:20.911 --> 01:04:23.090
<v Speaker 1>would call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Marcello Garcia Guillotine,</v>

1573
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.113
<v Speaker 1>which means like there's certain guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are really good at getting the </v>

1574
01:04:26.041 --> 01:04:28.500
<v Speaker 1>blade of the forum across your </v>
<v Speaker 1>esophagus.</v>

1575
01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>It's very painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1576
01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:34.740
<v Speaker 1>like some of like Amal Easton taught me </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do this and shout out to boulder,</v>

1577
01:04:34.741 --> 01:04:35.574
<v Speaker 1>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Amal Easton is a Jujitsu coach and </v>

1578
01:04:37.591 --> 01:04:38.424
<v Speaker 1>he's got a fantastic guillotine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things about his </v>

1579
01:04:41.161 --> 01:04:41.994
<v Speaker 1>guillotine is he knows how to get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>blade of that bolt right into your </v>

1580
01:04:45.601 --> 01:04:47.070
<v Speaker 1>esophagus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrific.</v>

1581
01:04:47.071 --> 01:04:47.904
<v Speaker 1>It feels terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they do it like with the high </v>

1582
01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:50.910
<v Speaker 1>elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't escape it.</v>

1583
01:04:50.911 --> 01:04:53.190
<v Speaker 1>It's and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an immediate feeling.</v>

1584
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:56.930
<v Speaker 1>That guy has his forearm right across </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guys throat.</v>

1585
01:04:56.931 --> 01:04:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

1586
01:04:58.741 --> 01:05:01.050
<v Speaker 1>If I'm holding that like that and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>clan,</v>

1587
01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:04.320
<v Speaker 1>he has his hands clasped together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you make it a little bigger so I can</v>

1588
01:05:04.321 --> 01:05:07.710
<v Speaker 1>see you and this is how right hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>resist like easy,</v>

1589
01:05:07.711 --> 01:05:09.750
<v Speaker 1>but you could still choke someone out </v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's,</v>

1590
01:05:09.751 --> 01:05:11.310
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell if his hands are connected.</v>

1591
01:05:11.311 --> 01:05:13.230
<v Speaker 1>I think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he's got a man inside.</v>

1592
01:05:13.231 --> 01:05:14.064
<v Speaker 1>His hair garners a hundred percent a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent and and his arms behind </v>

1593
01:05:16.831 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>his too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point</v>

1594
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.860
<v Speaker 2>is the guy was choking him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way he's doing that,</v>

1595
01:05:20.861 --> 01:05:22.810
<v Speaker 2>you could choke a guy like that with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>arm.</v>

1596
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:24.730
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have to have that right </v>
<v Speaker 2>arm in play.</v>

1597
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:27.390
<v Speaker 2>If he's got that left arm underneath the</v>
<v Speaker 2>neck like that.</v>

1598
01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:31.420
<v Speaker 2>All his dude's hooked the the back of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the head or the shoulder rather.</v>

1599

<v Speaker 2>here's the problem.</v>

1607
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:53.800

<v Speaker 2>Dos Anjos went into that octagon with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the weight of not just fighting colby </v>

1703
01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.473
<v Speaker 2>with his considerable skillset because </v>
<v Speaker 2>Colby beat him from fucking what round </v>

1704
01:09:58.011 --> 01:09:58.844
<v Speaker 2>one to round five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most rounds were controlled by colbys </v>

1705
01:10:01.401 --> 01:10:03.950
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most moments dos Anjos,</v>

1708
01:10:08.241 --> 01:10:11.330
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he has skill on top of that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a loss of composure.</v>

1722
01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:47.900
<v Speaker 2>He lost his composure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really did.</v>

1723
01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:48.763
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy for hyper aggressive and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>ran right into a perfectly place </v>

1724
01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:55.700
<v Speaker 2>lefthand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Anderson and chill had that too.</v>

1725
01:10:55.730 --> 01:10:56.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chill.</v>

1726
01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He frustrated Anderson.</v>

1727
01:10:58.381 --> 01:11:01.250
<v Speaker 2>So frustrated more with what he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing in the octagon.</v>

1728
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.113
<v Speaker 2>No saying saying first he talked crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad shit to peep for people to </v>

1729
01:11:06.831 --> 01:11:07.664
<v Speaker 2>appreciate shale as a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I say is you've seen some really </v>

1730
01:11:11.091 --> 01:11:14.220
<v Speaker 2>good fights and his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's had some wins that are very good.</v>

1731
01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.380
<v Speaker 2>He'd beat rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big win.</v>

1732
01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.513
<v Speaker 2>But if you go back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch him fight nate Marquardt cause </v>

1733
01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:23.100
<v Speaker 2>nate Marquardt was in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would come over from strikeforce.</v>

1734
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:27.630
<v Speaker 2>He was at that time when he had a busy </v>
<v Speaker 2>just leaving strikeforce.</v>

1735
01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.550
<v Speaker 2>He went to strike force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It became they're light.</v>

1736
01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:32.400
<v Speaker 2>They're a welterweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It became the one 70 over there.</v>

1737
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:35.820
<v Speaker 2>He peeked tyron woodley in this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking chaos sequence.</v>

1738
01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:38.250
<v Speaker 2>We blast with an elbow and hits him in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the upper cut.</v>

1739
01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.290
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the greatest Kaos sequences </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all time.</v>

1740
01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:42.660
<v Speaker 2>I play this for you now let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just say this,</v>

1741
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.080
<v Speaker 2>nate Marquardt at one point in time was </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best,</v>

1742
01:11:46.081 --> 01:11:49.210
<v Speaker 2>if not the best mixed martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter in this country has come give us</v>

1743
01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never,</v>

1744
01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.190
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never found the,</v>

1745
01:11:52.191 --> 01:11:55.530
<v Speaker 2>the UFC during his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his right moments in his crime.</v>

1746
01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:56.723
<v Speaker 2>He had already had all shit load of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights outside the UFC by the time he </v>

1747
01:11:59.021 --> 01:11:59.854
<v Speaker 2>got here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think he was probably a little </v>

1748
01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:03.080
<v Speaker 2>compromised by the time he got here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett.</v>

1749
01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:04.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1750
01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:09.940
<v Speaker 2>he won the title in the UFC when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to 44.</v>

1751
01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.850
<v Speaker 2>He's the youngest ever UFC heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>

1752
01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:12.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1753
01:12:12.871 --> 01:12:16.290
<v Speaker 2>that's clearly where Josh fought a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>at times VFC during one stint.</v>

1754
01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:17.543
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

1755
01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.380
<v Speaker 2>he got killed by Pedro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

1756
01:12:19.381 --> 01:12:22.290
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he beat randy couture for the title.</v>

1757
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Josh was a beast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1758
01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josh was a fucking beast.</v>

1759
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:28.490
<v Speaker 2>He really was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1760
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:29.383
<v Speaker 2>but so it was nate Marquardt and shale </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought nate Marquardt when nate </v>

1761
01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Marquardt was very close to his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went to war,</v>

1762
01:12:36.261 --> 01:12:38.830
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went to fucking war and chilled.</v>

1763
01:12:38.831 --> 01:12:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Nominated them until dominated them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1764
01:12:40.521 --> 01:12:44.300
<v Speaker 2>And we dominated with his wrestling is </v>

1765
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:46.010
<v Speaker 2>And because he seemed so silly when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've never lost us.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1769
01:12:52.761 --> 01:12:56.330

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is the sequence towards the end.</v>

1782
01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:21.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not the sequence where it was </v>

<v Speaker 1>the Kao CV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get right to the Kao thought I had </v>

<v Speaker 1>dominated him when he was in this era.</v>

1808
01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:27.843
<v Speaker 1>Tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what year was this fight and what year </v>

01:14:29.471 --> 01:14:31.180
<v Speaker 1>was [inaudible] fight against them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC?</v>

1810
01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:35.860
<v Speaker 1>So chill has some serious skill too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly with his wrestling.</v>

1811
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.420
<v Speaker 1>So people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1812
01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:39.120
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1813
01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:42.460
<v Speaker 1>but the trash talking was why he became </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous.</v>

1814
01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:45.150
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1815
01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:46.450
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a trash talker.</v>

1816
01:14:46.451 --> 01:14:48.750
<v Speaker 1>That's when I became aware of Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nate Marquardt.</v>

1817
01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1818
01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:51.220
<v Speaker 1>his lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1819
01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:54.250
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like nothing I'd ever seen.</v>

1820
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you absolutely suck.</v>

1821
01:14:58.790 --> 01:15:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw a bunch of Anderson fights and we</v>

1822
01:15:01.661 --> 01:15:03.730
<v Speaker 1>saw a bunch of pipe before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was never,</v>

1823
01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:05.800
<v Speaker 1>it was never that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bathroom was like,</v>

1824
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:06.663
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take him down and beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Tyron Woodley fight was in 2012 </v>

1825
01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:14.170
<v Speaker 1>and when did he fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chael Sonnen was before that.</v>

1826
01:15:14.171 --> 01:15:18.640
<v Speaker 1>See that's how good chell son and was he</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat that two years before,</v>

1827
01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:22.450
<v Speaker 1>before he went over to strike force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became the welterweight champion.</v>

1828
01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:23.493
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fought him in his absolute prime and </v>

1829
01:15:26.081 --> 01:15:27.940
<v Speaker 1>dominated them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could people,</v>

1830
01:15:27.941 --> 01:15:29.860
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is nate Marquardt duty fought.</v>

1831
01:15:29.861 --> 01:15:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Everybody lists her Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Horn.</v>

1832
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Now Damien Maia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one punch?</v>

1833
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Remembering in Maya Chael Sonnen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got lit up by Anderson though.</v>

1834
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Cardo Meda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this.</v>

1835
01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:42.760

<v Speaker 1>pounded him,</v>

1836
01:15:42.761 --> 01:15:44.500
<v Speaker 1>I think nate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate,</v>

1837
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:45.783
<v Speaker 1>nate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly I feel like nate at one 70 was </v>

1838
01:15:48.341 --> 01:15:49.150
<v Speaker 1>that as best?</v>

1839
01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you t k o to me grounded.</v>

1840
01:15:50.351 --> 01:15:51.184
<v Speaker 1>Pounded him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe at one seven he was at his </v>

1841
01:15:53.561 --> 01:15:56.800
<v Speaker 1>best like can you see him at the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would they fight because he was big,</v>

1842
01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:00.590
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't too bulky and he was a,</v>

1843
01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.680
<v Speaker 1>he was a very powerful guy for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight class.</v>

1844
01:16:02.681 --> 01:16:04.360
<v Speaker 1>If you could kept it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Class.</v>

1845
01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's lost a lot.</v>

1846
01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.410
<v Speaker 1>He lost a lot of fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1847
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:10.000
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think he's retiring now,</v>

1848
01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:12.640
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like two and six foot.</v>

1849
01:16:12.670 --> 01:16:13.503
<v Speaker 1>My point was it doesn't take anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the skill of the guy when </v>

1850
01:16:16.091 --> 01:16:18.160
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about his shit talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

1851
01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.173
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun aspect of what it is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to talk about and the activities </v>

1852
01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.700
<v Speaker 1>not making money off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is preposterous.</v>

1853
01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:27.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a ridiculous argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was saying that,</v>

1854
01:16:27.221 --> 01:16:28.054
<v Speaker 1>I said that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was doing it for pay per view </v>

1855
01:16:29.501 --> 01:16:30.334
<v Speaker 1>sales and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't get a penny of those paper </v>

1856
01:16:31.391 --> 01:16:33.430
<v Speaker 1>view sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a ridiculous thing.</v>

1857
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:34.270
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying,</v>

1858
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.010
<v Speaker 1>he's a dumb guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1859
01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:39.280
<v Speaker 1>his trash talk is just from a Ba from </v>
<v Speaker 1>from an uninformed point of view.</v>

1860
01:16:39.281 --> 01:16:42.550
<v Speaker 1>It's great because it's like stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidly like into something.</v>

1861
01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.430
<v Speaker 1>But like he's not educated on almost any</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject other than fighter.</v>

1862
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:47.470
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1863
01:16:47.471 --> 01:16:48.490
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to him.</v>

1864
01:16:48.491 --> 01:16:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he's very intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1865
01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:50.803
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a giving.</v>

1866
01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a Guinea harsh toward them.</v>

1867
01:16:55.481 --> 01:16:57.310
<v Speaker 1>My face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I look at all the Jews that one,</v>

1868
01:16:57.311 --> 01:17:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Nobel peace prizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobel Science Project,</v>

1869
01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.730
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the Nobel Prize for science?</v>

1870
01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:08.770
<v Speaker 1>One by more European Jews than I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>any other race.</v>

1871
01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Is it surprising?</v>

1872
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:11.001
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1873
01:17:11.001 --> 01:17:12.000
<v Speaker 2>that sounds right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something,</v>

1874
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:13.400
<v Speaker 2>any other race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any other,</v>

1875
01:17:13.401 --> 01:17:16.040
<v Speaker 2>I think any other like obvious </v>
<v Speaker 2>classification.</v>

1876
01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.460
<v Speaker 2>It's never a Sicilian Italians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the word's out,</v>

1877
01:17:19.461 --> 01:17:19.970
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1878
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:20.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're smart.</v>

1879
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Why are you guys smarter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that about?</v>

1880
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just honestly like just </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff jimmy the Greek was talking about,</v>

1881
01:17:27.381 --> 01:17:30.530
<v Speaker 2>but like in a positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just we're just our brains.</v>

1882
01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.460
<v Speaker 2>We're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've inner,</v>

1883
01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:32.181
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1884
01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Were bred for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have any outside genes.</v>

1885
01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1886
01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.350
<v Speaker 2>you know how some dogs are super like </v>
<v Speaker 2>loyal bread.</v>

1887
01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or we're just intelligence.</v>

1888
01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Everything else was falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be something to that.</v>

1889
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Why is it racist to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it racist?</v>

1890
01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:50.603
<v Speaker 2>I used to say we're smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy to say something is less </v>

1891
01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:53.890
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less.</v>

1892
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1893
01:17:54.861 --> 01:17:57.710
<v Speaker 2>we're the smartest ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe second,</v>

1894
01:17:58.730 --> 01:18:00.720
<v Speaker 2>maybe the Chinese guy you beat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1895
01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:01.573
<v Speaker 2>you know Asians.</v>

1896
01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:02.980
<v Speaker 2>This is what's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1897
01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:07.070
<v Speaker 2>There's a real issue right now with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Asians and university enrollments,</v>

1898
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.660
<v Speaker 2>particularly in Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They discriminate against Asians because</v>

1899
01:18:10.661 --> 01:18:13.040
<v Speaker 2>so many apply because so many are </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking ass.</v>

1900
01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To get them out of there.</v>

1901
01:18:16.210 --> 01:18:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1902
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.000
<v Speaker 2>there's like real talk about how this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy because Asian people for bye,</v>

1903
01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.353
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a generalization and try not to </v>

1904
01:18:25.761 --> 01:18:28.310
<v Speaker 2>be racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally speaking,</v>

1905
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:29.803
<v Speaker 2>Asian students are known as working very</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard and they're very dedicated and </v>

1906
01:18:34.731 --> 01:18:35.564
<v Speaker 2>they're very successful and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation is overwhelming in terms </v>

1907
01:18:39.111 --> 01:18:41.990
<v Speaker 2>of their numbers in the population and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're killing it,</v>

1908
01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:45.790
<v Speaker 2>killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because of that and their,</v>

1909
01:18:45.791 --> 01:18:48.200
<v Speaker 2>their mindset is to just work really </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

1910
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:52.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not to protest things and not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shut things down.</v>

1911
01:18:52.101 --> 01:18:54.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just creating the library.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all those protests.</v>

1912
01:18:54.291 --> 01:18:56.090
<v Speaker 2>There was in the library,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the Indians.</v>

1913
01:18:56.091 --> 01:18:57.380
<v Speaker 2>While this is all happening.</v>

1914
01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that they're not socially</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious,</v>

1915
01:18:59.361 --> 01:19:02.990
<v Speaker 2>but while this is all happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not protesting it the way may be</v>

1916
01:19:03.230 --> 01:19:04.063
<v Speaker 2>other groups that felt marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's people of color or trans </v>

1917
01:19:07.611 --> 01:19:08.930
<v Speaker 2>people or gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

1918
01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:11.330
<v Speaker 2>don't feel represented or discriminated </v>
<v Speaker 2>against.</v>

1919
01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:14.300
<v Speaker 2>They would be shutting down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1920
01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:18.890
<v Speaker 2>conferences and yelling down speakers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shouting out in the hallway.</v>

1921
01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.260
<v Speaker 2>But the Asians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole reason why they kick ass cause</v>

1922
01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.350
<v Speaker 2>cause they don't spend any time on petty</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

1923
01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.240
<v Speaker 2>He's like get done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because of that,</v>

1924
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:29.030
<v Speaker 2>the Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard fucking Harvard is saying,</v>

1925
01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:29.864
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be racist against you </v>

1926
01:19:30.651 --> 01:19:31.880
<v Speaker 2>cause we know you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>complain.</v>

1927
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Well wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1928
01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's pull this up.</v>

1929
01:19:34.791 --> 01:19:35.624
<v Speaker 2>Pull this up Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to pull up Asian students </v>

1930
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:43.490
<v Speaker 2>harder to get into Harvard lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1931
01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:46.040
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not a small amount.</v>

1932
01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:49.130
<v Speaker 2>They're discriminating by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making their grades considerably</v>

1933
01:19:49.131 --> 01:19:51.590
<v Speaker 2>higher in order to gain acceptance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1934
01:19:51.591 --> 01:19:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1935
01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:53.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's all because of a natural </v>

1936
01:19:54.111 --> 01:19:56.190
<v Speaker 2>breakdown of different races.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

1937
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:57.463
<v Speaker 2>you can't slow one down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard would have less less productive </v>

1938
01:20:01.671 --> 01:20:03.290
<v Speaker 2>graduates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1939
01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:06.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy way of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all in this idea of diversity,</v>

1940
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:09.630
<v Speaker 2>like instead treating people as </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals instead of just saying human</v>

1941
01:20:09.631 --> 01:20:10.464
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have each class represented </v>

1942
01:20:12.871 --> 01:20:17.110
<v Speaker 2>by a certain amount of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not anti [inaudible].</v>

1943
01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:22.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not a racist idea to want</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody to be treated as one.</v>

1944
01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:23.483
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be done with an eye on avoiding </v>

1945
01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:29.820
<v Speaker 2>all possible racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be done to treat people purely as</v>

1946
01:20:29.821 --> 01:20:30.654
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the worst way that can ever be </v>

1947
01:20:32.191 --> 01:20:34.380
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst way because you tell them most</v>

1948
01:20:34.381 --> 01:20:37.800
<v Speaker 2>successful people were complaining the </v>
<v Speaker 2>least that they have to work harder.</v>

1949
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:38.783
<v Speaker 2>You are getting fucked by your genes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You the people in your past and your </v>

1950
01:20:42.511 --> 01:20:43.344
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your little gene pool to good doing too </v>

1951
01:20:45.601 --> 01:20:48.540
<v Speaker 2>good in schools so we don't make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder than it is from my kids.</v>

1952
01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:49.853
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally what people are doing there </v>

1953
01:20:51.581 --> 01:20:53.000
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if they didn't harp,</v>

1954
01:20:53.001 --> 01:20:55.050
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be like all Asians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asians,</v>

1955
01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:55.884
<v Speaker 2>it'd be dominating and it the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why they think they can get away </v>

1956
01:20:59.101 --> 01:20:59.934
<v Speaker 2>with this lawsuit accuses Harvard have </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminated against Asian American </v>

1957
01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:05.070
<v Speaker 2>applicants in personal ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal writings.</v>

1958
01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:06.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1959
01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:11.550
<v Speaker 2>They're making it more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says students for fair admissions has</v>

1960
01:21:11.551 --> 01:21:12.384
<v Speaker 2>accused Harvard of intentionally </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminating against Asian American </v>

1961
01:21:14.851 --> 01:21:19.080
<v Speaker 2>applicants by limiting their admissions </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers so they're limiting the numbers.</v>

1962
01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.033
<v Speaker 2>I this many agents and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's super hard for like let's say </v>

1963
01:21:24.631 --> 01:21:27.460
<v Speaker 2>like Vietnamese or not the Chinese or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese Craig,</v>

1964
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:29.910
<v Speaker 2>you know we should say we don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is true.</v>

1965
01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:30.950
<v Speaker 2>We should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1966
01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.000
<v Speaker 2>just to be really clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a lawsuit.</v>

1967
01:21:33.001 --> 01:21:36.150
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is the argument and this is the</v>

1968
01:21:36.151 --> 01:21:36.961
<v Speaker 2>argument that many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

1969
01:21:36.961 --> 01:21:38.850
<v Speaker 2>many people have made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1970
01:21:38.851 --> 01:21:40.740
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really personally researched </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1971
01:21:40.741 --> 01:21:42.930
<v Speaker 2>but I know a lot of like legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals,</v>

1972
01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:45.210
<v Speaker 2>it brought this up and debates and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations and they're saying,</v>

1973
01:21:45.211 --> 01:21:46.500
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an issue.</v>

1974
01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:47.903
<v Speaker 2>This is essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is sanctioned racism against one </v>

1975
01:21:51.721 --> 01:21:52.554
<v Speaker 2>group because they're too effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're limiting the number of your </v>

1976
01:21:54.631 --> 01:21:58.350
<v Speaker 2>sag web where we're trying to get more </v>
<v Speaker 2>of an emphasis on like extra curriculars</v>

1977
01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:03.420
<v Speaker 2>in or out based on being Asian or based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on being European.</v>

1978
01:22:03.421 --> 01:22:04.254
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should get in or out by you having </v>

1979
01:22:06.991 --> 01:22:07.824
<v Speaker 2>merit and you being a a worthy student </v>
<v Speaker 2>and difficult schools like Harvard or </v>

1980
01:22:11.881 --> 01:22:14.940
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be difficult and if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cream of the crop all comes from Asia,</v>

1981
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:16.343
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't we look at what the fuck we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing here that we can't compete with </v>

1982
01:22:19.081 --> 01:22:19.260
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>

1983
01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:20.093
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

1984
01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Wow there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we want Asian students?</v>

1985
01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Do we want to compete with them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1986
01:22:24.751 --> 01:22:27.840
<v Speaker 2>is it too much or they were requiring </v>
<v Speaker 2>too much of their life to be successful.</v>

1987
01:22:27.841 --> 01:22:28.350
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their style,</v>

1988
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:29.790
<v Speaker 2>their schoolwork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1989
01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing too.</v>

1990
01:22:31.051 --> 01:22:31.884
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to want a normal life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to look up your normal life </v>

1991
01:22:34.171 --> 01:22:35.004
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going through college and </v>

1992
01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:40.290
<v Speaker 2>everything you're doing all day is </v>
<v Speaker 2>studying and you literally,</v>

1993
01:22:40.291 --> 01:22:41.124
<v Speaker 2>you might have like some fucking shitty </v>
<v Speaker 2>part job somewhere to make some money </v>

1994
01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:46.140
<v Speaker 2>for food and then you're studying more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1995
01:22:46.141 --> 01:22:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you have a part time job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't.</v>

1996
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:51.450
<v Speaker 2>So if you think about all that topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I want for my kids,</v>

1997
01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.450
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No way you,</v>

1998
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:56.400
<v Speaker 2>and especially with some of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are just for four years.</v>

1999
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:57.263
<v Speaker 2>Some of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that anything you're really </v>

2000
01:22:58.381 --> 01:23:00.210
<v Speaker 2>interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to get it on.</v>

2001
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:01.680
<v Speaker 2>You have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2002
01:23:01.681 --> 01:23:03.900
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a fully balanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>

2003
01:23:03.901 --> 01:23:06.280
<v Speaker 2>so you have to take classes you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>even remotely interested in.</v>

2004
01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.760
<v Speaker 2>You have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's this one way and this is how we</v>

2005
01:23:09.761 --> 01:23:10.594
<v Speaker 2>can assure that you have enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge that we can give you a piece </v>

2006
01:23:12.551 --> 01:23:17.551
<v Speaker 2>of paper that says you have a degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean an Asians or Kkr as well.</v>

2007
01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:19.853
<v Speaker 2>That's the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2008
01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Within those roles.</v>

2009
01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:21.933
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just going to work 20 hours a </v>

<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

2013
01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:30.400
<v Speaker 2>He was a u s national taekwondo team </v>
<v Speaker 2>member when I was like,</v>

2016
01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:38.500
<v Speaker 2>He was going through his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>residency.</v>

2017
01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.513
<v Speaker 2>He was going to be a doctor going </v>
<v Speaker 2>through his residency and training for </v>

2018
01:23:41.801 --> 01:23:44.440
<v Speaker 2>the national team and he was running </v>
<v Speaker 2>stairs,</v>

2019
01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.320
<v Speaker 2>running stairs in the school in between </v>
<v Speaker 2>studying,</v>

2020
01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:49.360
<v Speaker 2>he would do studying the nude run the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stairs.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You got to hold the guy got back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2022
01:23:51.011 --> 01:23:53.170
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't hold him back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He slept four hours a night.</v>

2023
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.440
<v Speaker 2>That if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2024
01:23:54.441 --> 01:23:56.710
<v Speaker 2>that's the same shit is like he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>always tired.</v>

2025
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always tired because he works hard.</v>

2026
01:23:59.290 --> 01:24:01.360
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always tired.</v>

2027
01:24:01.361 --> 01:24:03.700
<v Speaker 2>He would just show up exhausted and kick</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass.</v>

2028
01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:04.563
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he wasn't physically talented </v>

2029
01:24:05.501 --> 01:24:07.180
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy made it to the,</v>

2030
01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:08.043
<v Speaker 2>to the nationals and he became a </v>
<v Speaker 2>national champion and he wasn't even </v>

2031
01:24:10.781 --> 01:24:12.670
<v Speaker 2>like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really physically talented.</v>

2032
01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:15.850
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like some freak athlete that </v>
<v Speaker 2>just move super fast.</v>

2033
01:24:15.851 --> 01:24:18.490
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just fucking unbelievably smart,</v>

2034
01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:22.840
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably hard worker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I saw the way that guy was living as</v>

2035
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.943
<v Speaker 2>he was like I was a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 2>younger than him and he was going </v>

2036
01:24:25.991 --> 01:24:26.824
<v Speaker 2>through his residency and training and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing all this crazy shit at the same </v>

2037
01:24:29.021 --> 01:24:30.670
<v Speaker 2>time and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2038
01:24:30.730 --> 01:24:32.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm exhausted just watching you.</v>

2039
01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:35.860
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't see how this could be worth</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to do all those things.</v>

2040
01:24:35.861 --> 01:24:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Did you one of those things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what I want to do.</v>

2041
01:24:38.081 --> 01:24:40.550
<v Speaker 2>I want to do one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're doing two of those things.</v>

2042
01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:45.220
<v Speaker 2>He was doing what I was doing and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of it and more and way more,</v>

2043
01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:46.083
<v Speaker 2>way more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing schoolwork done was </v>

2044
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:51.730
<v Speaker 2>delivering newspapers and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's happening,</v>

2045
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:54.250
<v Speaker 2>they're just saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing as like making it so</v>

2046
01:24:54.251 --> 01:24:56.050
<v Speaker 2>white people get ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2047
01:24:56.170 --> 01:24:57.003
<v Speaker 2>It's like you could as loitering laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're arrested if you don't have a </v>

2048
01:24:59.321 --> 01:25:00.250
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

2049
01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.590
<v Speaker 2>this is where you could realize that all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff is crazy.</v>

2050
01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.580
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2051
01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.413
<v Speaker 2>you're being racist against a minority </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you think it's okay because they </v>

2052
01:25:08.051 --> 01:25:10.680
<v Speaker 2>kicked so much ass because there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

2053
01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:11.500
<v Speaker 2>So were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>

2054
01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:12.490
<v Speaker 2>we can take them down south.</v>

2055
01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:13.353
<v Speaker 2>It's literally racist because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying you can only have a certain </v>

2056
01:25:15.731 --> 01:25:18.400
<v Speaker 2>number of these people in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

2057
01:25:18.401 --> 01:25:21.090
<v Speaker 2>That's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be to,</v>

2058
01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:21.701
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

2059
01:25:21.701 --> 01:25:22.534
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to keep a diverse </v>

2060
01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:26.680
<v Speaker 2>population so you're not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>representative population of the best of</v>

2061
01:25:26.681 --> 01:25:28.570
<v Speaker 2>the best then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2062
01:25:28.571 --> 01:25:29.404
<v Speaker 2>they should take off any of their names </v>
<v Speaker 2>off of their applications or something </v>

2063
01:25:31.961 --> 01:25:33.540
<v Speaker 2>like that and just were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see what they got.</v>

2064
01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:34.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I guess they'd probably judge you </v>

2065
01:25:36.341 --> 01:25:37.540
<v Speaker 2>based on many things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2066
01:25:37.570 --> 01:25:38.403
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try that for the old daily show </v>

2067
01:25:39.221 --> 01:25:41.650
<v Speaker 2>with Jon Stewart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just take the names off the application.</v>

2068
01:25:41.651 --> 01:25:43.840
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to see your names just for</v>
<v Speaker 2>your writing sample.</v>

2069
01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's smart.</v>

2070
01:25:45.210 --> 01:25:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's smart.</v>

2071
01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what happened though.</v>

2072
01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:51.220
<v Speaker 2>The hired only white males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goddammit.</v>

2073
01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:53.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the John Stewart was like,</v>

2074
01:25:53.710 --> 01:25:54.543
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess we're going in blind is not </v>

2075
01:25:56.681 --> 01:25:58.360
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess we fucked up.</v>

2076
01:25:59.230 --> 01:26:01.420
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that just shows it's not our fault.</v>

2077
01:26:01.421 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 2>That's just fucking randomly we had </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight people and they happen to be white</v>

2078
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.240
<v Speaker 1>dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing though,</v>

2079
01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:08.540
<v Speaker 1>if you had movers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2080
01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:12.200
<v Speaker 1>and you wanted to move furniture and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>tested people for moving furniture,</v>

2081
01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:14.940
<v Speaker 1>is it okay to hire all men?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2082
01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:15.853
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2083
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Because they're physically stronger </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically right now.</v>

2084
01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it okay to hire someone who you think</v>

2085
01:26:24.561 --> 01:26:25.394
<v Speaker 1>is going to be the best at the job or do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a certain amount of </v>

2086
01:26:28.341 --> 01:26:31.280
<v Speaker 1>women so you wouldn't expect it from </v>
<v Speaker 1>something physical,</v>

2087
01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:32.413
<v Speaker 1>like a moving company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why should it be mandatory for </v>

2088
01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:35.390
<v Speaker 1>something like a creative thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2089
01:26:35.391 --> 01:26:36.224
<v Speaker 1>it's different a little bit because no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one except the client is appreciating </v>

2090
01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:40.860
<v Speaker 1>the movers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2091
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:41.743
<v Speaker 1>It's just like if I'm hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only one who have to deal with </v>

2092
01:26:44.121 --> 01:26:45.580
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>doing a show like a woman's show,</v>

2095
01:26:50.091 --> 01:26:51.530
<v Speaker 1>a woman's comedy show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2096
01:26:51.650 --> 01:26:55.340
<v Speaker 1>And what am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I may know or am I a woman?</v>

2097
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:56.810
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to be a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

2098
01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and you want,</v>

2099
01:26:58.821 --> 01:26:59.654

<v Speaker 1>you want to have like a female voice to </v>

2100
01:27:02.241 --> 01:27:03.074
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you wanted to is hire some really </v>

2101
01:27:03.831 --> 01:27:07.310
<v Speaker 1>funny chicks and what guy's gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2102
01:27:07.311 --> 01:27:09.080
<v Speaker 1>obviously it happens way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2103
01:27:09.081 --> 01:27:09.914
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more often the opposite way where </v>

2104
01:27:11.391 --> 01:27:14.300
<v Speaker 1>women get discriminated against but what</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy is going to say no,</v>

2105
01:27:14.301 --> 01:27:16.310
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a part of this.</v>

2106
01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2107
01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I should have a job here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should call a troll.</v>

2108
01:27:19.630 --> 01:27:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Troll won't be equally represented male </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus female cause that's what a lot of</v>

2109
01:27:24.081 --> 01:27:25.580
<v Speaker 1>people feel like when it comes to men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women.</v>

2110
01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:26.443
<v Speaker 1>Like someone was telling bird on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast that the comedy store should be </v>

2111
01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:30.770
<v Speaker 1>half a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that lady just,</v>

2112
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:34.850
<v Speaker 1>she has no idea what American comedy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>all about.</v>

2113
01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:37.160
<v Speaker 1>La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2114
01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's speaking in an uninformed way.</v>

2115
01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:41.450
<v Speaker 1>The white shell does a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's ridiculous,</v>

2116
01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:42.500
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a joke.</v>

2117
01:27:42.501 --> 01:27:45.080
<v Speaker 1>He's just not that smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You all get tell that whatever.</v>

2118
01:27:45.230 --> 01:27:48.140
<v Speaker 1>But this one was the same as jail where </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like uninformed.</v>

2119
01:27:48.141 --> 01:27:51.830
<v Speaker 1>They just going full bore and she wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing to promote anything.</v>

2120
01:27:51.831 --> 01:27:53.480
<v Speaker 1>She was just doing it because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was right,</v>

2121
01:27:53.481 --> 01:27:53.871
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2122
01:27:53.871 --> 01:27:55.670
<v Speaker 1>you don't really understand how this </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

2123
01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:58.093
<v Speaker 1>There's a process or it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a blog once said we need more </v>

2124
01:28:00.291 --> 01:28:02.420
<v Speaker 1>women in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like hiring positions.</v>

2125
01:28:02.421 --> 01:28:03.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2126
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:06.080
<v Speaker 1>you mean the head of the comedy store?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The head of the fucking comedy cellar,</v>

2127
01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.070
<v Speaker 1>head of New York comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2128
01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kobe are like,</v>

2129
01:28:10.431 --> 01:28:12.920
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of female bookers like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know,</v>

2130
01:28:12.921 --> 01:28:14.040
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to tell them that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it,</v>

2131
01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:14.691
<v Speaker 1>then she go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2132
01:28:14.691 --> 01:28:15.200
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2133
01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize that.</v>

2134
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:17.383
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain things that people love </v>

2135
01:28:17.901 --> 01:28:21.710
<v Speaker 1>to say when they've done almost no </v>
<v Speaker 1>research on what it actually is.</v>

2136
01:28:22.110 --> 01:28:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One lady had no clue.</v>

2137
01:28:24.171 --> 01:28:26.330
<v Speaker 1>She just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting in here.</v>

2138
01:28:26.331 --> 01:28:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting in here.</v>

2139
01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:30.750
<v Speaker 1>It must be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not causation and causality.</v>

2140
01:28:30.751 --> 01:28:32.000
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be because of this.</v>

2141
01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I've had my agents calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2142
01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.550
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked for Mitzi.</v>

2143
01:28:34.730 --> 01:28:37.020
<v Speaker 1>When agents or managers call sound like </v>
<v Speaker 1>my client in,</v>

2144
01:28:37.021 --> 01:28:39.050
<v Speaker 1>she'd go fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that we do things here,</v>

2145
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.943
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got in an argument with someone about </v>

2146
01:28:40.791 --> 01:28:41.624
<v Speaker 1>the wage gap and they really believed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that men and women work right next to </v>

2147
01:28:45.411 --> 01:28:46.244
<v Speaker 1>each other doing the same job and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman is only making 75 cents to the </v>

2148
01:28:48.291 --> 01:28:50.520
<v Speaker 1>guys dollar I'm going to put out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>in no time.</v>

2149
01:28:50.530 --> 01:28:51.363
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy thing to argue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going to argue that you </v>

2150
01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.750
<v Speaker 1>should know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should know what that is.</v>

2151
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you just talking shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>which we all do sometimes.</v>

2152
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:01.830
<v Speaker 1>But you gotta be willing to say as </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change,</v>

2153
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:03.170
<v Speaker 5>I believe that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe in that.</v>

2154
01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:07.380
<v Speaker 5>It's like which studies have you read?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's almost always no zero studies.</v>

2155
01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.050
<v Speaker 5>I like to believe this or versus </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2156
01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:11.610
<v Speaker 5>Luckily we're not in charge of making </v>
<v Speaker 5>decisions.</v>

2157
01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:15.240
<v Speaker 5>People Love,</v>
<v Speaker 5>love to put these studies out.</v>

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:58.040
<v Speaker 5>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would be hired at far higher rights</v>

2177
01:29:58.530 --> 01:30:00.190
<v Speaker 5>or you can look deeper at it and be </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2178
01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:02.290
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just like total jobs or whatever it</v>

2179
01:30:02.291 --> 01:30:02.771
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>

2180
01:30:02.771 --> 01:30:03.604
<v Speaker 5>I haven't raised studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just listened to people who've </v>

2181
01:30:05.831 --> 01:30:06.540
<v Speaker 5>have,</v>

2182
01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something to that.</v>

2183
01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:10.043
<v Speaker 2>If they're really could hire the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>people for the same job and get a woman </v>

2184
01:30:14.011 --> 01:30:16.440
<v Speaker 2>who's just as good at it for 75 cents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's horseshit though.</v>

2185
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:17.303
<v Speaker 2>They would all at higher only women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people who don't know what we're </v>

2186
01:30:19.171 --> 01:30:21.840
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all based on what jobs you choose.</v>

2187
01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:22.943
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not that men don't make </v>
<v Speaker 2>more money because they do the same job </v>

2188
01:30:25.861 --> 01:30:27.870
<v Speaker 2>and make more money at that job and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman does.</v>

2189
01:30:27.871 --> 01:30:30.480
<v Speaker 2>They do different jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the wage gap is.</v>

2190
01:30:30.481 --> 01:30:33.210
<v Speaker 2>The wage gap is in the number of hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>that men work,</v>

2191
01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:36.330
<v Speaker 2>the different jobs that they choose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they excel in.</v>

2192
01:30:36.570 --> 01:30:40.110
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with like two </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are both,</v>

2193
01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:42.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same line on a,</v>

2194
01:30:42.231 --> 01:30:44.550
<v Speaker 2>on an assembly line or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that with the same amount of time.</v>

2195
01:30:44.650 --> 01:30:46.170
<v Speaker 2>And they both make the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2196
01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one or rather the male makes a </v>

2197
01:30:49.501 --> 01:30:53.790
<v Speaker 2>dollar a dollar for every 75 cents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not how the wage gap works.</v>

2198
01:30:53.791 --> 01:30:54.730
<v Speaker 2>It's just different jobs.</v>

2199
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:56.060
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So hearing that information,</v>

2200
01:30:56.061 --> 01:30:58.820
<v Speaker 5>like I remember when I first heard it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like you can either go,</v>

2201
01:30:58.821 --> 01:30:59.654
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just trying to fucking shit on </v>

2202
01:31:01.821 --> 01:31:03.050
<v Speaker 5>women or you can go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh,</v>

2203
01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:04.580
<v Speaker 5>well let me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never thought of that.</v>

2204
01:31:04.581 --> 01:31:05.414
<v Speaker 5>Let me look into that a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then I'll get back to you instead of </v>

2205
01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.170
<v Speaker 5>immediately reacting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck off.</v>

2206
01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:10.093
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get mad like that's not what it </v>

2207
01:31:10.881 --> 01:31:11.271
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2208
01:31:11.271 --> 01:31:11.901
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is what?</v>

2209
01:31:11.901 --> 01:31:12.734
<v Speaker 2>It is foolish if you keep arguing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>me because you don't even know what it </v>

2210
01:31:15.381 --> 01:31:17.060
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a dumb conversation.</v>

2211
01:31:17.061 --> 01:31:17.894
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't argue with you when I know that </v>

2212
01:31:19.371 --> 01:31:22.880
<v Speaker 2>you haven't read any of the stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>points to these numbers.</v>

2213
01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2214
01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:29.680
<v Speaker 2>the thing is no one should be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you do,</v>

2215
01:31:29.710 --> 01:31:30.543
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it is you make incredible </v>

2216
01:31:33.191 --> 01:31:36.290
<v Speaker 2>sculptures or you build cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2217
01:31:36.291 --> 01:31:38.920
<v Speaker 2>you're a painter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck it is that you do,</v>

2218
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:43.740
<v Speaker 2>no one should be able to say that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this</v>

2219
01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:47.480
<v Speaker 5>definitely should make as much money as </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing that.</v>

2220
01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:52.030
<v Speaker 5>No things are worth what they're worth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We remember Tommy Dilutes Bowler.</v>

2221
01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:52.991
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2222
01:31:52.991 --> 01:31:57.880
<v Speaker 5>At some point he was ranked I think top </v>
<v Speaker 5>15 in the world at his sport,</v>

2223
01:31:58.180 --> 01:31:59.530
<v Speaker 5>which is the equivalent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like</v>

2224
01:31:59.770 --> 01:32:00.603
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to even think who would be </v>

2225
01:32:02.170 --> 01:32:05.360
<v Speaker 2>like Carmelo Anthony and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom.</v>

2226
01:32:05.361 --> 01:32:10.361
<v Speaker 2>It dilutes at his sport made 38 grand </v>
<v Speaker 2>and and fucking and,</v>

2227
01:32:10.690 --> 01:32:13.300
<v Speaker 2>and Carmela makes you know 20 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2228
01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your sports not as popular.</v>

2229
01:32:15.490 --> 01:32:17.880
<v Speaker 2>It's just not as popular weight classes </v>
<v Speaker 2>in his popular whatever,</v>

2230
01:32:17.881 --> 01:32:19.040
<v Speaker 2>how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2231
01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:21.130
<v Speaker 2>That's just how it was not fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>assault after.</v>

2232
01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:22.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see how you would want more </v>

2233
01:32:23.231 --> 01:32:24.070
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2234
01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:25.030
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody does.</v>

2235
01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:25.893
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like there's certain people that </v>

2236
01:32:28.901 --> 01:32:30.490
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a harder do that job.</v>

2237
01:32:30.491 --> 01:32:31.324
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why they do it is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know that it's more valuable so </v>

2238
01:32:34.151 --> 01:32:36.450
<v Speaker 2>they work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely get that job done.</v>

2239
01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Imagine being the fuck and CEO of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporation.</v>

2240
01:32:39.671 --> 01:32:40.504
<v Speaker 2>How much pressure would be on you all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time being fucking Tim Cook over at </v>

2241
01:32:46.001 --> 01:32:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Apple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

2242
01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:49.270
<v Speaker 2>well that's why I don't get paid as much</v>
<v Speaker 2>as him.</v>

2243
01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It horrible.</v>

2244
01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2245
01:32:51.971 --> 01:32:52.804
<v Speaker 2>Well that is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This same philosophy is the reason why </v>

2246
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.823
<v Speaker 2>women approach now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I say some women I should say </v>

2247
01:32:58.901 --> 01:32:59.734
<v Speaker 2>because there it's like super hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive career oriented women that </v>

2248
01:33:02.501 --> 01:33:03.334
<v Speaker 2>work as hard or harder than men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe even harder to prove that there </v>

2249
01:33:05.651 --> 01:33:06.484
<v Speaker 2>was tough as demand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they would take the approach that </v>

2250
01:33:08.141 --> 01:33:09.550
<v Speaker 2>you and I would take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2251
01:33:09.551 --> 01:33:11.620
<v Speaker 2>fuck that life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not doing that.</v>

2252
01:33:12.010 --> 01:33:12.843
<v Speaker 2>Whereas it's statistically more males </v>
<v Speaker 2>push themselves by working longer and </v>

2253
01:33:17.831 --> 01:33:19.430
<v Speaker 2>harder hours on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comparison,</v>

2254
01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:22.390
<v Speaker 2>try to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a natural thing.</v>

2255
01:33:22.391 --> 01:33:23.224
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to win a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a competition you have is </v>

2256
01:33:25.001 --> 01:33:26.860
<v Speaker 2>putting points on the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

2257
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:28.690
<v Speaker 2>serialism realism is fool's game to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

2258
01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see people doing that.</v>

2259
01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.960
<v Speaker 2>My friends from high school and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2260
01:33:31.961 --> 01:33:35.500
<v Speaker 2>you're wasting your life for what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four digit number?</v>

2261
01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:36.341
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2262
01:33:36.341 --> 01:33:38.980
<v Speaker 2>you're not doing anything with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is men,</v>

2263
01:33:38.981 --> 01:33:39.814
<v Speaker 2>they get stuck in this loop of </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligation that get stuck in a loop of </v>

2264
01:33:42.971 --> 01:33:43.804
<v Speaker 2>children and a mortgage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once you have a car and a nice </v>

2265
01:33:48.941 --> 01:33:50.980
<v Speaker 2>house and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you maybe you want to get a boat,</v>

2266
01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:52.053
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get stuck and you have all these </v>

2267
01:33:53.351 --> 01:33:56.140
<v Speaker 2>payments and obligations and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to wear because you have a family.</v>

2268
01:33:56.650 --> 01:33:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you always wanted to be a rock and</v>
<v Speaker 2>roll singer.</v>

2269
01:33:59.070 --> 01:33:59.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2270
01:33:59.591 --> 01:34:00.424
<v Speaker 2>and you never fucking got a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of the blocks and you're living </v>

2271
01:34:02.651 --> 01:34:05.500
<v Speaker 2>your life in this angry state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfulfilled,</v>

2272
01:34:05.501 --> 01:34:09.040
<v Speaker 2>angry state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the advice is for the young,</v>

2273
01:34:09.290 --> 01:34:10.123
<v Speaker 2>the advices for young people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The advice is for people that look at </v>

2274
01:34:12.101 --> 01:34:12.934
<v Speaker 2>their parents and all these other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are telling them what they have to </v>

2275
01:34:14.471 --> 01:34:15.304
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2276
01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Are they right or the other or is there </v>
<v Speaker 2>a fucking path out there?</v>

2277
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:24.640
<v Speaker 2>If you just figure out what you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>liked to do and just only go that way,</v>

2278
01:34:25.090 --> 01:34:25.923
<v Speaker 2>because if you go this way and then I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna take a couple of years off and go </v>

2279
01:34:28.121 --> 01:34:29.950
<v Speaker 2>that way for a while and then I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>

2280
01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:30.993
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go back to school and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>my degree just so I have something to </v>

2281
01:34:33.311 --> 01:34:34.720
<v Speaker 2>fall back on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just didn't,</v>

2282
01:34:34.721 --> 01:34:35.554
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't get any further down the </v>

2283
01:34:36.521 --> 01:34:37.660
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in the same spot.</v>

2284
01:34:37.661 --> 01:34:39.340
<v Speaker 2>You would have been if he didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2285
01:34:40.150 --> 01:34:41.530
<v Speaker 2>You got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to go forward.</v>

2286
01:34:41.710 --> 01:34:43.790
<v Speaker 2>But if you something forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's the wrong direction,</v>

2287
01:34:43.791 --> 01:34:46.040
<v Speaker 2>you're still getting experience doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2288

2332
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:28.280
<v Speaker 1>when you're on a machine you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

2333
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:29.623
<v Speaker 1>unless you're listening to a good book </v>
<v Speaker 1>on tape or you're watching a television </v>

2334
01:36:32.841 --> 01:36:34.340
<v Speaker 1>show or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's boring.</v>

2335
01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:37.520
<v Speaker 1>But when you're running you got to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>about where you're stupid.</v>

2336
01:36:37.521 --> 01:36:41.030
<v Speaker 1>You're high and watching like some </v>

<v Speaker 1>Like there's something about having like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad ass song.</v>

2340
01:36:49.041 --> 01:36:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Like you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't hear your own breath,</v>

2341
01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:51.493
<v Speaker 1>put some peaches on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get a nice rhythm that </v>

2342
01:36:56.661 --> 01:36:57.494
<v Speaker 1>doesn't freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it freaks me out sometimes when I </v>

2343
01:36:59.151 --> 01:37:02.540
<v Speaker 1>hear a rhythm of me really pushing hard </v>

2345
01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.410

<v Speaker 1>But when you're listening to music,</v>

2346
01:37:06.411 --> 01:37:07.940
<v Speaker 1>you don't even think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just keep going.</v>

2347
01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:13.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like a little meditative trick </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupies your mind some weird way.</v>

2348
01:37:13.731 --> 01:37:16.250
<v Speaker 1>It lets you to put like just a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra effort in.</v>

2349
01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.260
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus you gotta get off your phone.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I hear a lot what people say are about </v>

2511
01:44:04.431 --> 01:44:05.810

01:44:18.710 --> 01:44:19.543
<v Speaker 5>It's a game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's making me organize stuff and it </v>

2516
01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:22.453
<v Speaker 5>totally different way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's nice to have like a little column </v>

2517
01:44:24.681 --> 01:44:26.990
<v Speaker 5>to the left where I put all subject </v>
<v Speaker 5>matter.</v>

2518
01:44:26.991 --> 01:44:27.824
<v Speaker 5>And then to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>each one of those click and it'll show </v>

2519
01:44:29.031 --> 01:44:30.650
<v Speaker 5>you all the shit you've written on that </v>
<v Speaker 5>subject.</v>

2520
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:33.470
<v Speaker 5>So you could move it around like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can,</v>

2521
01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:35.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could put your,</v>

2522
01:44:35.230 --> 01:44:38.270
<v Speaker 5>your set in order with something like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2523
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:40.010
<v Speaker 5>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2524
01:44:40.170 --> 01:44:42.340
<v Speaker 5>I trying to do I need that for this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing this out.</v>

2525
01:44:42.341 --> 01:44:44.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to do all juice stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2526
01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.910
<v Speaker 5>And I do the thing about the demons and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other dimension.</v>

2527
01:44:47.110 --> 01:44:47.943
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nice.</v>

2528
01:44:48.110 --> 01:44:51.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm closing with that back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

2529
01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:53.810
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2530
01:44:53.811 --> 01:44:54.644

<v Speaker 5>like how many like stories about two </v>

<v Speaker 5>expertise on this.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2534

<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2558
01:45:54.321 --> 01:45:55.154
<v Speaker 5>and then I see it as it from a fresh </v>
<v Speaker 5>point of view for the first time in 20 </v>

2559
01:45:57.261 --> 01:45:58.850
<v Speaker 5>years of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2560
01:45:58.851 --> 01:46:02.330
<v Speaker 5>it's just because it represents the </v>
<v Speaker 5>watson.</v>

2561
01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:04.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2562
01:46:04.610 --> 01:46:06.530
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like just all the stories,</v>

2563
01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:07.551
<v Speaker 5>all the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>

2564
01:46:07.551 --> 01:46:08.384
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a story of Purim where esther </v>

2565
01:46:11.770 --> 01:46:13.850
<v Speaker 5>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to go so far back or all days,</v>

2566
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:14.923
<v Speaker 5>but one of the first feminists in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Talmud and the Torah itself was the </v>

2567
01:46:19.221 --> 01:46:23.180
<v Speaker 5>story of Purim where Vashti,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the queen of the king,</v>

2568
01:46:23.630 --> 01:46:26.150
<v Speaker 5>not Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was called to say,</v>

2569
01:46:26.151 --> 01:46:26.984
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come in front of my court and show your </v>

2570
01:46:27.921 --> 01:46:29.110
<v Speaker 5>naked body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2571
01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:31.220
<v Speaker 5>and she refused.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>

2572
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:32.083
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing that.</v>

2573
01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:34.060
<v Speaker 5>It was one of the first feminist </v>
<v Speaker 5>character spa.</v>

2574
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.821
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2575
01:46:34.821 --> 01:46:35.654
<v Speaker 5>and she was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was banished and they looked for </v>

2576
01:46:36.561 --> 01:46:37.394
<v Speaker 5>another princess and it was this Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 5>lady that was in hiding about her </v>

2577
01:46:39.831 --> 01:46:42.200
<v Speaker 5>Judaism forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was weird.</v>

2578
01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:43.100
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Vashi,</v>

2579
01:46:43.101 --> 01:46:43.934
<v Speaker 5>we always viewed her as this great </v>
<v Speaker 5>feminist leader who could stand up for </v>

2580
01:46:46.461 --> 01:46:48.020
<v Speaker 5>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then recently,</v>

2581
01:46:48.250 --> 01:46:50.340
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my sephardic Jewish friend who's deep in</v>

2582
01:46:50.341 --> 01:46:51.570
<v Speaker 5>there too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he pointed,</v>

2583
01:46:51.571 --> 01:46:51.871
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2584
01:46:51.871 --> 01:46:51.990
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2585
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:54.390
<v Speaker 5>She had herpes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She had a herpes outbreak.</v>

2586
01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:56.700
<v Speaker 5>She did want to show her body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She didn't just suddenly,</v>

2587
01:46:56.701 --> 01:46:59.520
<v Speaker 5>that wasn't the first time because he </v>
<v Speaker 5>did more research on it.</v>

2588
01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:00.413
<v Speaker 5>I know you'd read all the commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Rashi and all that stuff on there </v>

2589
01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:04.170
<v Speaker 5>and they bring it down like </v>
<v Speaker 5>legitimately.</v>

2590
01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:06.990
<v Speaker 5>So some stuff he didn't really think </v>
<v Speaker 5>about and other stuff you're like,</v>

2591
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:08.910
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh.</v>

2592
01:47:08.970 --> 01:47:10.740
<v Speaker 5>There was a story of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a rabbi who,</v>

2593
01:47:10.770 --> 01:47:11.603
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his students were being killed by a </v>

2594
01:47:13.411 --> 01:47:16.740
<v Speaker 5>dragon and I read this and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not supposed to be a metaphor.</v>

2595
01:47:16.770 --> 01:47:19.470
<v Speaker 5>Nothing in this supposed to be metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also means something else.</v>

2596
01:47:19.471 --> 01:47:21.510
<v Speaker 5>Act as metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also be real.</v>

2597
01:47:21.690 --> 01:47:22.770
<v Speaker 5>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's dragging?</v>

2598
01:47:22.771 --> 01:47:24.000
<v Speaker 5>Are you talking about his killing </v>
<v Speaker 5>students?</v>

2599
01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:26.220
<v Speaker 5>And I showed my rabbi this and he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2600
01:47:26.610 --> 01:47:28.200
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is one metaphor.</v>

2601
01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:29.790
<v Speaker 5>It's jerking off.</v>

2602
01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:30.893
<v Speaker 5>It's masturbation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were dying off at night and the </v>

2603
01:47:32.671 --> 01:47:33.990
<v Speaker 5>rabbi to kill the Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2604
01:47:33.991 --> 01:47:34.824
<v Speaker 5>this is the best part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The rabbit had killed the dragon hid </v>

2605
01:47:35.821 --> 01:47:38.130
<v Speaker 5>under one of the students beds until the</v>
<v Speaker 5>dragging attack.</v>

2606
01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:39.151
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>

2607
01:47:39.151 --> 01:47:40.230
<v Speaker 5>what is all this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

2608
01:47:40.231 --> 01:47:41.520
<v Speaker 5>it's masturbation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2609
01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:44.490
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2610
01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:48.180
<v Speaker 5>Now it makes sense as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this makes sense to me in a normal way.</v>

2611
01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:53.070
<v Speaker 5>The only metaphor has to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so insane.</v>

2612
01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:53.933
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now I'm starting to look at all that </v>

2613
01:47:56.161 --> 01:47:59.730
<v Speaker 5>shit from an adult removed point of view</v>
<v Speaker 5>with an insider's knowledge of it.</v>

2614
01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:01.253
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so fun to do it on stage when you </v>

2615
01:48:02.071 --> 01:48:04.410
<v Speaker 5>can make a crowd who doesn't know </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything about Judaism,</v>

2616
01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:07.380
<v Speaker 5>understand it and fucking laugh at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2617
01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm really having fun now.</v>

2618
01:48:09.810 --> 01:48:11.130
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2619
01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.360
<v Speaker 5>that sounds exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to see,</v>

2620
01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:14.940
<v Speaker 5>are you going up tonight?</v>

2621
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:16.111
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2622
01:48:16.111 --> 01:48:18.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm flying home tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will be back July.</v>

2623
01:48:18.121 --> 01:48:20.460
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in July.</v>

2624
01:48:20.461 --> 01:48:23.130
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm running a previous show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about that because we had</v>

2625
01:48:23.131 --> 01:48:25.020
<v Speaker 5>always talked about that like years and </v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

2626
01:48:25.021 --> 01:48:26.610
<v Speaker 5>Like you should be talking about that on</v>
<v Speaker 5>stage.</v>

2627
01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.590
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't good enough.</v>

2628
01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:29.291
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2629
01:48:29.291 --> 01:48:31.320

2719
01:52:02.501 --> 01:52:05.510
<v Speaker 5>inside your group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's just a section of laws really is</v>

01:52:55.850 --> 01:52:56.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2744
01:52:56.301 --> 01:53:00.470
<v Speaker 1>some of them changed holidays and still </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it to control your own population</v>

2745
01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:02.000
<v Speaker 1>with laws to help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2746
01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:02.893
<v Speaker 1>don't kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps you live as a society so you </v>

2747
01:53:05.091 --> 01:53:05.924
<v Speaker 1>can like be okay with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a high takes the similarities in </v>

2748
01:53:07.790 --> 01:53:10.730
<v Speaker 1>all of them and so like don't kill the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of the flood.</v>

2749
01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a real similar thing that lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions,</v>

2750
01:53:12.711 --> 01:53:13.544
<v Speaker 1>so that must be a real thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and then the the don't eat pig </v>

2751
01:53:18.111 --> 01:53:19.610
<v Speaker 1>is like nat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a Jew thing.</v>

2752
01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a trick of gnosis thing.</v>

2753
01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:24.670
<v Speaker 1>That's not the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2754
01:53:26.210 --> 01:53:27.980
<v Speaker 1>the origin maybe.</v>

2755
01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:28.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people were dying from it </v>

2756
01:53:30.201 --> 01:53:32.690
<v Speaker 1>and also the shellfish thing because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>red tide,</v>

2757
01:53:32.930 --> 01:53:34.830
<v Speaker 1>they go if they didn't know when to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately predict,</v>

2758
01:53:34.831 --> 01:53:35.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cer,</v>

2759
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:37.940
<v Speaker 1>certain times of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shellfish are absolutely toxic.</v>

2760
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2761
01:53:38.811 --> 01:53:40.170
<v Speaker 1>It's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2762
01:53:40.610 --> 01:53:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I always wanted to know when it is.</v>

2763
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:44.623
<v Speaker 1>But you can't get like clams and mussels</v>
<v Speaker 1>from certain beaches during certain </v>

2764
01:53:48.891 --> 01:53:51.380
<v Speaker 1>times of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't cause it's tower and humanity.</v>

2765
01:53:51.381 --> 01:53:52.570
<v Speaker 1>That's why I could have started for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2766
01:53:52.590 --> 01:53:53.423
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No rabbis and telling me the reason we </v>

2767
01:53:54.411 --> 01:53:56.960
<v Speaker 1>don't eat pig is because God said right </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the end of it.</v>

2768
01:53:57.020 --> 01:53:57.853
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that they probably ate it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and probably try to eat it raw and </v>

2769
01:54:01.701 --> 01:54:04.570
<v Speaker 1>people got deathly ill and children died</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2770
01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:05.473
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2771
01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:08.420
<v Speaker 1>whenever I'm like don't after enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>many generations that you don't,</v>

2772
01:54:08.421 --> 01:54:08.780
<v Speaker 1>it's like why?</v>

2773
01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:09.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like our God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2774
01:54:10.150 --> 01:54:10.761
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sun,</v>

2775
01:54:10.761 --> 01:54:11.594
<v Speaker 1>God says tide as a phenomenon caused by </v>
<v Speaker 1>algae blooms during which algae becomes </v>

2776
01:54:14.601 --> 01:54:16.130
<v Speaker 1>so numerous that it does color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2777
01:54:16.131 --> 01:54:16.401
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2778
01:54:16.401 --> 01:54:17.120
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

2779
01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:20.930
<v Speaker 1>The release toxins that may cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>illnesses in humans or other animals.</v>

2780
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:22.303
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is for whatever it is that </v>

2781
01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red tide,</v>

2782
01:54:25.371 --> 01:54:27.380
<v Speaker 1>shellfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to figure out why you're</v>

2783
01:54:27.381 --> 01:54:31.220
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it red tide shellfish here?</v>

2784
01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I think they might be talking about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly different thing.</v>

2785
01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same stuff.</v>

2786
01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:42.280
<v Speaker 1>So consumption of shellfish that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminants by the toxins can Taz,</v>

2787
01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:45.260
<v Speaker 1>neurotoxic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shellfish poisoning.</v>

2788
01:54:46.130 --> 01:54:46.963
<v Speaker 1>NSP symptoms usually appear when a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of hours of eating contaminated </v>

2789
01:54:50.061 --> 01:54:53.360
<v Speaker 1>shellfish and they last for a few days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that is red tide.</v>

2790
01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:58.250
<v Speaker 1>So most likely something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can say that the reason why they chose</v>

2791
01:54:58.251 --> 01:55:01.820
<v Speaker 1>to not eat shellfish and tricking gnosis</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really common.</v>

2792
01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:03.110
<v Speaker 1>And pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they eat everything.</v>

2793
01:55:03.111 --> 01:55:05.180
<v Speaker 1>They eat rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigs eat everything they can.</v>

2794
01:55:05.210 --> 01:55:07.940
<v Speaker 1>They ground nesting birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The I could for sure.</v>

2795
01:55:07.941 --> 01:55:10.640
<v Speaker 1>See that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why that started up and obviously</v>

2796
01:55:10.641 --> 01:55:13.360
<v Speaker 1>like the don't fucking nerve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His wife that's so I move,</v>

2797
01:55:14.130 --> 01:55:16.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll be fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Scott says don't do that.</v>

2798
01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:17.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God says,</v>

2799
01:55:17.571 --> 01:55:19.010
<v Speaker 1>stop fucking everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2800
01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

2801
01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:22.580
<v Speaker 1>there's some of them that are real </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal's right.</v>

2802
01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:24.500
<v Speaker 1>They travel from every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every religion.</v>

2803
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:25.363
<v Speaker 1>It's like people figured out rules that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should operate by to have a </v>

2804
01:55:28.281 --> 01:55:30.220
<v Speaker 1>harmonious existence with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbors.</v>

2805
01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then other ones,</v>

2806
01:55:32.181 --> 01:55:33.014
<v Speaker 1>it's just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that I'm stepped back and someone </v>

2807
01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:36.170
<v Speaker 1>will ask me about a of mock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2808
01:55:37.330 --> 01:55:38.163
<v Speaker 1>I just started laughing about what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose was and how it looks from the </v>

2809
01:55:40.071 --> 01:55:44.430
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about the one that's in Old</v>

2810
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:45.263
<v Speaker 1>Testament where God sends a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears down to kill kids because they </v>

2811
01:55:48.661 --> 01:55:50.220
<v Speaker 1>were making fun of this guy being bald.</v>

2812
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:52.330
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2813
01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these,</v>

2814
01:55:53.521 --> 01:55:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy thing.</v>

2815
01:55:55.230 --> 01:55:57.420
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the best ones ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy is,</v>

2816
01:55:57.421 --> 01:55:58.254
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids are taunting this guy and </v>

2817
01:55:59.731 --> 01:56:03.120
<v Speaker 1>calling him bald and so God sends these </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears.</v>

2818
01:56:03.121 --> 01:56:05.250
<v Speaker 1>This guy's doing God's work and God </v>
<v Speaker 1>protects his people.</v>

2819
01:56:05.670 --> 01:56:08.940
<v Speaker 1>God sends some fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she bears to eat these kids,</v>

2820

<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

2822
01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:15.743
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alicia,</v>

2823
01:56:15.930 --> 01:56:16.763
<v Speaker 1>Alicia and the two bears make that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little beer for my shitty sort of </v>

2824
01:56:19.050 --> 01:56:20.740
<v Speaker 1>profits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2825
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:23.610

<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

2826
01:56:24.570 --> 01:56:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you're bald head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what they're saying.</v>

2827
01:56:27.991 --> 01:56:30.240

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2828
01:56:30.241 --> 01:56:33.960

<v Speaker 1>he cursed them in the name of the Lord,</v>

2829
01:56:33.961 --> 01:56:38.590
<v Speaker 1>all caps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then two female came out of the woods,</v>

2830
01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:42.270
<v Speaker 1>tore up 42 lads up their number and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>

2832
01:56:44.250 --> 01:56:47.260
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to read into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the actual thing.</v>

2833
01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:50.880
<v Speaker 1>So like some shit was happening baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a different time,</v>

2837
01:57:00.241 --> 01:57:05.190
<v Speaker 1>bears but lived inside a whale and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't say miracle on that.</v>

2838
01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:06.233
<v Speaker 1>They just said the way later but didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking swallow and he was just there </v>

2840
01:57:10.110 --> 01:57:13.010
<v Speaker 1>I just was operating from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not An understanding of how things work.</v>

2841
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:15.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where they made star wars in </v>

2842
01:57:16.261 --> 01:57:17.440
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the name of shooting that?</v>

2843
01:57:17.441 --> 01:57:18.274
<v Speaker 1>That rudder and it was just open to </v>
<v Speaker 1>space because we didn't know yet that </v>

2844
01:57:21.751 --> 01:57:22.081
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2845
01:57:22.081 --> 01:57:25.140
<v Speaker 1>that'll just kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just have open the space.</v>

2846
01:57:25.141 --> 01:57:26.520
<v Speaker 1>You need like a barrier there.</v>

2847
01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:27.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be like 250 degrees below </v>

2848
01:57:28.531 --> 01:57:32.670
<v Speaker 1>zero just like it's an open window is </v>
<v Speaker 1>firing out.</v>

2849
01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

2850
01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:35.153
<v Speaker 1>But we didn't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like not sounds right or you can </v>

2851
01:57:37.191 --> 01:57:38.024
<v Speaker 1>live inside a whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're in space and someone </v>

2852
01:57:39.811 --> 01:57:44.500
<v Speaker 1>breaks the window shoot match if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some s cause you know that number,</v>

2853
01:57:44.501 --> 01:57:45.930
<v Speaker 1>that alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one alien movie,</v>

2854
01:57:46.830 --> 01:57:51.020
<v Speaker 1>the bullet hole he got dragged out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty bad ass.</v>

2855
01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:52.253
<v Speaker 1>But what's his face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bayzos is going to offer flights to </v>

2856
01:57:54.211 --> 01:57:55.800

<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we did an episode of his show in Montana</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we went camping together and got </v>

2885
01:59:10.031 --> 01:59:11.680
<v Speaker 1>fucked up by a campfire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was really fun.</v>

2888
01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:18.550
<v Speaker 1>But I was stunned when that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2889
01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:20.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2891
01:59:22.061 --> 01:59:22.894
<v Speaker 1>when you were at your worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were having like really shitty </v>

2892
01:59:25.721 --> 01:59:26.554
<v Speaker 1>feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what could have been anything that </v>

2893
01:59:30.041 --> 01:59:32.050
<v Speaker 1>someone could have done that could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped you?</v>

2894
01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about this too.</v>

2895
01:59:33.581 --> 01:59:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I lost a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a suicide and it was like,</v>

2896
01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:39.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to stop because like what,</v>

2897
01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:40.660
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could you have done?</v>

2898
01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2899
01:59:42.490 --> 01:59:45.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean sometimes just all fall on me </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a therapist that fuck,</v>

2900
01:59:45.770 --> 01:59:46.603
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't afford.</v>

2901
01:59:47.110 --> 01:59:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told you this before,</v>

2902
01:59:48.041 --> 01:59:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I probably on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like a physical thing to do,</v>

2903
01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:54.640
<v Speaker 1>but just getting me to go to accept like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2904
01:59:54.641 --> 01:59:56.000
<v Speaker 1>maybe it'll work well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2905
01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:56.913
<v Speaker 1>I knew when I was talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a hard thing for you to talk </v>

2906
02:00:00.071 --> 02:00:01.450
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're bringing it up,</v>

2907
02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:03.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real issue.</v>

2908
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2909
02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:05.380
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stoic.</v>

2910
02:00:05.590 --> 02:00:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2911
02:00:06.670 --> 02:00:08.490
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't complain about that.</v>

2912
02:00:08.850 --> 02:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>People with my negative stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done.</v>

2913
02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:13.480
<v Speaker 1>So I remember we were playing pool and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

2914
02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>what's matter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something going on.</v>

2915
02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:17.303
<v Speaker 1>Like you just seem like just unhappy or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so once we got you into that </v>

2916
02:00:21.671 --> 02:00:22.504
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist and dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you popped out of that thing like a </v>

2917
02:00:24.371 --> 02:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>fucking spring pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2918
02:00:26.951 --> 02:00:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went running,</v>

2919
02:00:27.851 --> 02:00:29.980
<v Speaker 1>like anybody who thinks that pills are </v>
<v Speaker 1>all bad,</v>

2920
02:00:30.730 --> 02:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anything's all anything.</v>

2921
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:35.170
<v Speaker 1>I think I know the black and white </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem where there are people,</v>

2922
02:00:35.171 --> 02:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>like I talked to Benji won,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like there are over prescribing</v>

2923
02:00:36.991 --> 02:00:37.301
<v Speaker 1>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2924
02:00:37.301 --> 02:00:38.620
<v Speaker 1>they worked for me and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2925
02:00:38.710 --> 02:00:39.550
<v Speaker 1>I probably didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2926
02:00:39.551 --> 02:00:39.701
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2927
02:00:39.701 --> 02:00:40.534
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because you think they're over </v>

2928
02:00:41.021 --> 02:00:42.820
<v Speaker 1>prescribing it doesn't mean they should </v>
<v Speaker 1>never prescribed.</v>

2929
02:00:42.850 --> 02:00:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2930
02:00:44.170 --> 02:00:45.003
<v Speaker 1>there's stuff that works and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>it works enough for you to just change </v>

2931
02:00:47.891 --> 02:00:48.724
<v Speaker 1>your way of looking at the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>change your reality and then you </v>

2932
02:00:52.511 --> 02:00:56.020
<v Speaker 1>eventually weaned yourself off of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting.</v>

2933
02:00:56.050 --> 02:00:56.883
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a sprain of the brain muscle is </v>

2934
02:00:59.231 --> 02:01:01.120
<v Speaker 1>what's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2935
02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a physical,</v>

2936
02:01:03.701 --> 02:01:05.540
<v Speaker 1>like pull like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2937
02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:07.480
<v Speaker 1>but that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a sprain.</v>

2938
02:01:07.481 --> 02:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>And so like until you get off it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2939
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:10.263
<v Speaker 1>to get on a cast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if some way it's going to be real hard </v>

2940
02:01:12.071 --> 02:01:12.904
<v Speaker 1>for it to heal.</v>

2941
02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:14.373
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like so far this metaphor works </v>

2942
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.823
<v Speaker 1>that does work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works in the most effective cases </v>

2943
02:01:21.490 --> 02:01:26.320
<v Speaker 1>like yours of medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these pills act as a cast and then at</v>

2944
02:01:26.321 --> 02:01:29.320
<v Speaker 1>some point you're healed and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>need them anymore.</v>

2945
02:01:29.770 --> 02:01:30.603
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really know is if you just get off it </v>

2946
02:01:34.231 --> 02:01:35.800
<v Speaker 1>and run on it and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

2947
02:01:35.801 --> 02:01:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm still hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2948
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:37.663
<v Speaker 1>And during that get off and run on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time is you're suicidal thoughts shoot </v>

2949
02:01:41.001 --> 02:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>up if they were going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they do wean you off,</v>

2950
02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:46.010
<v Speaker 1>they're like you need to keep up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2951
02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:46.903
<v Speaker 1>Like anything you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to call me immediately you can </v>

2952
02:01:49.391 --> 02:01:50.224
<v Speaker 1>to write back on like what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting with you is you are weaning </v>

2953
02:01:53.331 --> 02:01:57.740
<v Speaker 1>off coincided with huge success in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

2954
02:01:58.580 --> 02:01:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got off him,</v>

2955
02:02:00.050 --> 02:02:02.630
<v Speaker 1>I know where I got off on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was my second apartment in New York.</v>

2956
02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:08.200
<v Speaker 1>So this was three and a half years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four years ago maybe around there.</v>

2957
02:02:08.810 --> 02:02:11.240
<v Speaker 1>This is not happening is already on </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy central.</v>

2958
02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:13.190
<v Speaker 1>It's things are going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are going good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then you released my first hour and </v>

2961
02:02:18.081 --> 02:02:19.670
<v Speaker 1>then my second hour.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So beyond that I was,</v>

2964
02:02:26.171 --> 02:02:27.004
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean more importantly was I was a </v>

2965
02:02:27.921 --> 02:02:29.570

<v Speaker 1>So that was like the best part.</v>

2968
02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that hadn't been going on very long,</v>

2969
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:38.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking,</v>

2971
02:02:40.010 --> 02:02:42.290
<v Speaker 1>people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't know.</v>

2972
02:02:42.291 --> 02:02:43.124
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking crazy struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The struggle from open Miker to </v>

2973
02:02:45.981 --> 02:02:48.560
<v Speaker 1>successful working comedian and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's different,</v>

2974
02:02:48.561 --> 02:02:50.960
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got their own weirdness that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to overcome,</v>

2975
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:53.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's a long ass bloody struggle.</v>

2976
02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:54.650
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

2977
02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:56.930
<v Speaker 1>That's why I hate this infighting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

2978
02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:58.850
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like you're doing this wrong,</v>

2979
02:02:58.851 --> 02:02:59.660
<v Speaker 1>your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2980
02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:02.420
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all up against the most monumental</v>

2981
02:03:02.421 --> 02:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>odds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you write safety,</v>

2982
02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:06.950
<v Speaker 1>safe show jokes and this guy writes Dick</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jokes.</v>

2983
02:03:07.420 --> 02:03:09.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just like predispositions,</v>

2984
02:03:09.171 --> 02:03:13.880
<v Speaker 1>but like it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all in the same boat anyway.</v>

2985
02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree man.</v>

2986
02:03:15.110 --> 02:03:17.270
<v Speaker 1>And that dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't,</v>

2987
02:03:18.050 --> 02:03:21.830
<v Speaker 1>it's very rarely been the case in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of comedy that everybody kind of</v>

2988
02:03:21.831 --> 02:03:22.664
<v Speaker 1>got along and just accepted the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everybody does things differently </v>

2989
02:03:24.621 --> 02:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>and not make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

2990
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:27.180
<v Speaker 1>don't make a big deal out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2991
02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to have factions inside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

2992
02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:31.370
<v Speaker 1>it's one you want to have a safe space </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2993
02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2994
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:32.833
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to hear shit like </v>

2995
02:03:33.531 --> 02:03:34.100
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

2996
02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been a show?</v>

2997
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Have Your Black Knight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine to have everything.</v>

2998
02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my.</v>

2999
02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wants to hold their ground and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up for their position on things.</v>

3000
02:03:43.851 --> 02:03:44.684
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3001
02:03:45.130 --> 02:03:46.890
<v Speaker 1>you going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's going to prison or just,</v>

3002
02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:49.940
<v Speaker 1>it's the best time ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kick ass.</v>

3003
02:03:49.941 --> 02:03:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Just keep writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go out there and do it.</v>

3004
02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:53.091
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3005
02:03:53.091 --> 02:03:55.470
<v Speaker 1>And then it got better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of that was it.</v>

3006
02:03:55.490 --> 02:03:57.170
<v Speaker 1>The focus I was able to get because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

3007
02:03:57.500 --> 02:03:58.760
<v Speaker 1>it was rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3008
02:03:58.820 --> 02:03:59.653
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3009
02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:02.750
<v Speaker 1>not well beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried Wellbutrin.</v>

3010
02:04:02.780 --> 02:04:06.590
<v Speaker 1>The problem is some of these pills like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the side effects are not worth it.</v>

3011
02:04:07.850 --> 02:04:11.480
<v Speaker 1>So what I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone had a problem once,</v>

3012
02:04:11.481 --> 02:04:13.640
<v Speaker 1>a fucking anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3013

<v Speaker 1>use of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about this shit nicky was </v>

3014
02:04:16.150 --> 02:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3015
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:18.103
<v Speaker 1>he's right now planning on bombing out </v>
<v Speaker 1>embassy and it was like he didn't want </v>

3016
02:04:21.651 --> 02:04:23.720
<v Speaker 1>to go on it cause he was afraid it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>make him like a Zombie.</v>

3017
02:04:23.721 --> 02:04:24.201
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3018
02:04:24.201 --> 02:04:27.380
<v Speaker 1>if it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go back off it so you don't have to</v>

3019
02:04:27.381 --> 02:04:28.700
<v Speaker 1>commit forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3020
02:04:28.730 --> 02:04:30.230
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just see what the effects are.</v>

3021
02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:32.720
<v Speaker 1>So on I think Wellbutrin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3022
02:04:32.721 --> 02:04:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh it was fresh and I,</v>

3023
02:04:35.630 --> 02:04:38.060
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even say it was any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psycho periodic</v>

3024
02:04:38.090 --> 02:04:38.923
<v Speaker 3>thing cause I didn't know about that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a side effect until that was happening </v>

3025
02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:43.110
<v Speaker 3>with my girlfriend at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3026
02:04:43.111 --> 02:04:44.570
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like three times in a row.</v>

3027
02:04:44.571 --> 02:04:45.690
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just couldn't come.</v>

3028
02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:47.101
<v Speaker 3>And then she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3029
02:04:47.101 --> 02:04:48.180
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's those pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3030
02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:49.170
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3031
02:04:49.230 --> 02:04:50.040
<v Speaker 3>And then I looked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3032
02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:52.260
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking annoying.</v>

3033
02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:54.870
<v Speaker 3>It's an annoying thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's super annoying.</v>

3034
02:04:55.410 --> 02:05:00.210
<v Speaker 3>There was this one called rem or Ron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about like how many circuits there</v>

3035
02:05:00.211 --> 02:05:03.900
<v Speaker 3>are matching so much in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll think of something that gets in</v>

3036
02:05:03.901 --> 02:05:05.370
<v Speaker 3>there and fixes this was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3037
02:05:05.380 --> 02:05:06.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take that away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They come thing,</v>

3038
02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:09.420
<v Speaker 3>oh it's like you edit your own computer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My God.</v>

3039
02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:10.453
<v Speaker 3>Like by taking those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like you edit your own </v>

3040
02:05:12.061 --> 02:05:12.894
<v Speaker 3>opera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember when you have a a pc you can </v>

3041
02:05:14.281 --> 02:05:16.440
<v Speaker 3>get into dos defragging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do shit.</v>

3042
02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:19.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's almost like what you're doing.</v>

3043
02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:20.333
<v Speaker 3>So the side effect on run run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these side effects don't hit everybody </v>

3044
02:05:22.861 --> 02:05:26.280
<v Speaker 3>the same and what you're looking to fill</v>
<v Speaker 3>in isn't all the same.</v>

3045
02:05:26.281 --> 02:05:28.710
<v Speaker 3>So don't just get with somebody else </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets you got to talk to a therapist.</v>

3046
02:05:28.711 --> 02:05:31.350
<v Speaker 3>But like Rem Ron gave me hyper Phasia </v>
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

3047
02:05:31.710 --> 02:05:32.543
<v Speaker 3>Which is the inability to be feel full.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they said expect to gain 15% of your </v>

3048
02:05:37.021 --> 02:05:39.390
<v Speaker 3>body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I could eat,</v>

3049
02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:41.520
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I got high,</v>

3050
02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:44.100
<v Speaker 3>I could eat like eight plates of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Spaghetti.</v>

3051
02:05:44.130 --> 02:05:46.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would eat out my whole apartment.</v>

3052
02:05:46.530 --> 02:05:47.640
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

3053
02:05:47.641 --> 02:05:48.870
<v Speaker 3>It got to the point where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3054
02:05:48.871 --> 02:05:51.540
<v Speaker 3>I got one big left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some peanut butter and some a little bit</v>

3055
02:05:51.541 --> 02:05:54.240
<v Speaker 3>of Cheerio's and fucking let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

3056
02:05:54.290 --> 02:05:56.310
<v Speaker 3>and it was glorious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that it wasn't helping me.</v>

3057
02:05:56.311 --> 02:05:57.144
<v Speaker 3>That was a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a side effect because I was </v>

3058
02:05:57.901 --> 02:06:01.560
<v Speaker 3>thin then I could have dealt with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be 15 pounds overweight instead of</v>

3059
02:06:01.561 --> 02:06:03.390
<v Speaker 3>10 pounds underweight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

3060
02:06:04.020 --> 02:06:05.310
<v Speaker 3>it didn't help me mentally.</v>

3061
02:06:05.730 --> 02:06:08.520
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3062
02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:10.800
<v Speaker 3>and then I finally got on one to </v>
<v Speaker 3>separate me.</v>

3063
02:06:10.810 --> 02:06:12.840
<v Speaker 3>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it worked.</v>

3064
02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:13.771
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

3065
02:06:13.771 --> 02:06:14.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3066
02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:17.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm free now a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3067
02:06:18.050 --> 02:06:20.430
<v Speaker 3>but low blood pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes I stayed up,</v>

3068
02:06:20.431 --> 02:06:23.700
<v Speaker 3>I got to hold on to something and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not fucking faint,</v>

3069
02:06:23.730 --> 02:06:26.310
<v Speaker 3>but barely ever happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally worth it.</v>

3070
02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:28.710
<v Speaker 3>And that still happens now when I get </v>
<v Speaker 3>high.</v>

3071
02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:31.320
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you get like,</v>

3072
02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:32.490
<v Speaker 3>dizzy lightheaded?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3073
02:06:32.491 --> 02:06:33.324
<v Speaker 3>I stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3074
02:06:33.330 --> 02:06:34.163
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to get real high with for that </v>

3075
02:06:35.311 --> 02:06:37.470
<v Speaker 3>to happen or early or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3076
02:06:37.471 --> 02:06:38.640
<v Speaker 3>Or if I'm getting sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll happen.</v>

3077
02:06:38.641 --> 02:06:40.170
<v Speaker 3>But I used to get that in high school </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3078
02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:42.810
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm already predisposed to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they made it a little worse.</v>

3079
02:06:42.860 --> 02:06:43.890
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a big deal though.</v>

3080
02:06:43.891 --> 02:06:45.510
<v Speaker 3>So I finally found the one that worked </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

3081
02:06:45.511 --> 02:06:47.760
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard and if you're not having </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3082
02:06:47.761 --> 02:06:48.594
<v Speaker 3>your brain is lying to you or it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving you a version of reality that's </v>

3083
02:06:51.661 --> 02:06:55.650
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I saw this last night coming home</v>

3084
02:06:55.651 --> 02:06:59.970
<v Speaker 3>from the airport from Burbank airport </v>
<v Speaker 3>and some lady picked up in an Uber,</v>

3085
02:07:00.150 --> 02:07:02.620
<v Speaker 3>picked up a guy on the wrong side of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fence and she was,</v>

3086
02:07:02.621 --> 02:07:03.960
<v Speaker 3>sorry it's my first time here.</v>

3087
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:07.320
<v Speaker 3>But like it's one of those little fences</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just step over almost,</v>

3088
02:07:07.321 --> 02:07:08.580
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

3089
02:07:08.581 --> 02:07:10.480
<v Speaker 3>well everyone else is gone here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

3090
02:07:10.481 --> 02:07:10.921
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

3091
02:07:10.921 --> 02:07:11.754
<v Speaker 3>It's my first time at the Burbank </v>
<v Speaker 3>airport I can and you can't get to walk </v>

3092
02:07:13.621 --> 02:07:16.100
<v Speaker 3>10 seconds to where it's an opening and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's white.</v>

3093
02:07:16.101 --> 02:07:17.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like pop the trunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop the trunk place,</v>

3094
02:07:17.731 --> 02:07:18.331
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3095
02:07:18.331 --> 02:07:20.370
<v Speaker 3>you're cranky from flying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what that is.</v>

3096
02:07:20.690 --> 02:07:24.720
<v Speaker 3>And so your version of this reality is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a way worse thing than it really</v>

3097
02:07:24.721 --> 02:07:26.790
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve Simone who never gets upset,</v>

3098
02:07:26.791 --> 02:07:27.670
<v Speaker 3>which was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know deal,</v>

3099
02:07:27.700 --> 02:07:29.790
<v Speaker 3>I'll just come around and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>

3100
02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:31.133
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing we've talked to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fitzsimmons like you can just not punch </v>

3101
02:07:32.731 --> 02:07:35.290
<v Speaker 3>somebody and then forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3102
02:07:35.291 --> 02:07:36.124
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're thinking that angrily all the </v>

3103
02:07:37.131 --> 02:07:37.964
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really affects you and this shit </v>

3104
02:07:38.831 --> 02:07:40.630
<v Speaker 3>makes you think the worst of everything.</v>

3105
02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3106
02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:45.423
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what it is so little worse </v>

3107
02:07:47.470 --> 02:07:51.130
<v Speaker 3>than it should be an interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at it.</v>

3108
02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:54.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just gets tiring after awhile and</v>

3109
02:07:54.341 --> 02:07:56.530
<v Speaker 3>the suicidal thoughts start happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're like,</v>

3110
02:07:57.610 --> 02:08:01.210
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3111
02:08:02.230 --> 02:08:04.690
<v Speaker 3>it's effort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's mental effort to just like,</v>

3112
02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:05.710
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just keeps,</v>

3113
02:08:06.010 --> 02:08:07.800
<v Speaker 3>it's like you've got to rock on you that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pulling up,</v>

3114
02:08:07.810 --> 02:08:12.550
<v Speaker 3>pushing off you at all times and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just need the game to be over.</v>

3115
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:16.270
<v Speaker 3>You just need a sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Theo is to have a bit about,</v>

3116
02:08:16.271 --> 02:08:18.190
<v Speaker 3>I think he probably didn't have special </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something by now,</v>

3117
02:08:18.191 --> 02:08:21.160
<v Speaker 3>but it was like if you want that deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep,</v>

3118
02:08:21.410 --> 02:08:23.890
<v Speaker 3>deep sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's what it is,</v>

3119
02:08:23.891 --> 02:08:24.724
<v Speaker 3>where you just want to sleep forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just weighed down by it all the </v>

3120
02:08:27.371 --> 02:08:28.181
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3121
02:08:28.181 --> 02:08:29.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how they used to like,</v>

3122
02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:30.123
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get people to give false confessions by </v>

3123
02:08:32.291 --> 02:08:35.380
<v Speaker 3>just keeping them awake for like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight hours until they eventually,</v>

3124
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:36.550
<v Speaker 3>like they don't know how to say no.</v>

3125
02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:38.620
<v Speaker 3>The fine I did it and stuff they did </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't do,</v>

3126
02:08:38.650 --> 02:08:40.600
<v Speaker 3>they weren't anywhere near it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're just saying,</v>

3127
02:08:40.601 --> 02:08:41.381
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I murdered somebody,</v>

3128
02:08:41.381 --> 02:08:43.960
<v Speaker 3>let me sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a version of that,</v>

3129
02:08:44.710 --> 02:08:45.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're just like,</v>

3130
02:08:46.990 --> 02:08:47.823
<v Speaker 3>he's just so sick of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After a while I will tell you that they </v>

3131
02:08:52.490 --> 02:08:56.260
<v Speaker 3>have read about it and they say the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who talk about suicide or sort of</v>

3132
02:08:56.261 --> 02:08:57.094
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who are thinking about it </v>

3133
02:08:58.391 --> 02:08:59.224
<v Speaker 3>quietly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who quietly is weight way more often to </v>

3134
02:09:02.111 --> 02:09:04.140
<v Speaker 3>commit it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3135
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:08.230
<v Speaker 3>I think they say the people talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it as a way to seek help.</v>

3136
02:09:08.590 --> 02:09:09.423
<v Speaker 3>So what can you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question was what could you do to </v>

3137
02:09:11.621 --> 02:09:12.454
<v Speaker 3>help people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there anything that anybody could </v>

3138
02:09:14.261 --> 02:09:15.160
<v Speaker 3>have done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3139
02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:17.950
<v Speaker 3>it used to make me mad when you told me </v>
<v Speaker 3>just get out of bed to some exercise.</v>

3140
02:09:19.110 --> 02:09:20.080
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get it.</v>

3141
02:09:20.170 --> 02:09:22.690
<v Speaker 3>You don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely don't get it.</v>

3142
02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shandra understood at once.</v>

3143
02:09:24.611 --> 02:09:27.280
<v Speaker 3>She was like talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

3144
02:09:27.790 --> 02:09:29.740
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even go to your fridge.</v>

3145
02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:31.593
<v Speaker 3>Like exercise is not even just so far </v>
<v Speaker 3>from like no way I could couldn't even </v>

3146
02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:39.940
<v Speaker 3>get out of bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think was,</v>

3147
02:09:39.990 --> 02:09:40.823
<v Speaker 3>you were also taking propecia then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>had anything to do with it because </v>

3148
02:09:44.591 --> 02:09:46.390
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the site event I'm for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

3149
02:09:46.391 --> 02:09:47.224
<v Speaker 3>Might have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was right around then and I </v>

3150
02:09:48.641 --> 02:09:49.690
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think,</v>

3151
02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:51.033
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was quitting right then on it and </v>

3152
02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:56.200
<v Speaker 3>switched into the fucking spread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3153
02:09:57.060 --> 02:09:58.270
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stem cell research.</v>

3154
02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.950
<v Speaker 3>But I think it was either on it or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

3155
02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:04.290
<v Speaker 3>or getting off it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3156
02:10:04.450 --> 02:10:06.100
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

3157
02:10:06.270 --> 02:10:07.360
<v Speaker 3>Could have had something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3158
02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:08.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so too.</v>

3159
02:10:09.070 --> 02:10:10.680
<v Speaker 3>It was also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3160
02:10:11.010 --> 02:10:11.843
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>live in girl.</v>

3161
02:10:11.890 --> 02:10:12.723
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was so many things right around </v>

3162
02:10:13.241 --> 02:10:14.800
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all it takes is a sprain.</v>

3163
02:10:14.980 --> 02:10:15.813
<v Speaker 3>So like here's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you lost your job and that </v>

3164
02:10:18.421 --> 02:10:20.110
<v Speaker 3>sends you into a depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

3165
02:10:20.111 --> 02:10:23.170
<v Speaker 3>that is not related to something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times it will be related,</v>

3166
02:10:23.171 --> 02:10:24.820
<v Speaker 3>something a mom dies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad dies.</v>

3167
02:10:24.821 --> 02:10:28.180
<v Speaker 3>But let's say the job situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can change this,</v>

3168
02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:29.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your Dad dies,</v>

3169
02:10:29.381 --> 02:10:30.910
<v Speaker 3>you'll never get them back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3170
02:10:30.911 --> 02:10:33.530
<v Speaker 3>it feels bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so like it should bad,</v>

3171
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:36.020
<v Speaker 3>you lose your job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go into depression,</v>

3172
02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:38.810
<v Speaker 3>but now you get a better job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3173
02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:39.673
<v Speaker 3>Not that you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's just say you did the </v>

3174
02:10:41.031 --> 02:10:42.290
<v Speaker 3>depression remains.</v>

3175
02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:45.860
<v Speaker 3>The causes of depression is necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>

3176
02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:48.740
<v Speaker 3>You're doing better than the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>made you depressed,</v>

3177
02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:51.710
<v Speaker 3>but you're still depressed because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain is sprained.</v>

3178
02:10:51.770 --> 02:10:54.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you need a way to fight it.</v>

3179
02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:57.530
<v Speaker 3>And pills don't work for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's fucking disheartening.</v>

3180
02:10:57.531 --> 02:10:59.600
<v Speaker 3>And getting the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a therapist say,</v>

3181
02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:01.100
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like this,</v>

3182
02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:01.931
<v Speaker 3>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pills not working.</v>

3183
02:11:01.931 --> 02:11:02.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3184
02:11:02.330 --> 02:11:04.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to tell Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3185
02:11:04.730 --> 02:11:06.200
<v Speaker 3>and in my head I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3186
02:11:06.201 --> 02:11:08.540
<v Speaker 3>I accept it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Work up the courage eventually,</v>

3187
02:11:08.541 --> 02:11:10.730
<v Speaker 3>and that'll be the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3188
02:11:10.731 --> 02:11:11.720
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I going to fight you on it?</v>

3189
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:13.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to fight this in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

3190
02:11:13.311 --> 02:11:15.830
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How she was the worst,</v>

3191
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:18.470
<v Speaker 3>what was it like to get pulled out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the clouds?</v>

3192
02:11:19.370 --> 02:11:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Like when the pills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pills started working,</v>

3193
02:11:21.261 --> 02:11:26.261
<v Speaker 3>working at first it's like you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>trust that it's gone.</v>

3194
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:32.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like right when the hiccups leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still feel like you're the hiccups,</v>

3195
02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:33.883
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3196
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:39.310
<v Speaker 3>but like a way longer version of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what happens weird is you start</v>

3197
02:11:40.521 --> 02:11:41.354
<v Speaker 3>to miss it because it became so much of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your reality and who you were that like </v>

3198
02:11:46.610 --> 02:11:48.530
<v Speaker 3>it's this thing that's been pulled away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from you.</v>

3199
02:11:48.531 --> 02:11:50.600
<v Speaker 3>A part of you is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

3200
02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:54.350
<v Speaker 3>So it's weird that you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>miss this horrible way of being,</v>

3201
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.863
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you had to figure out a way to </v>

3202
02:11:57.561 --> 02:11:58.394
<v Speaker 3>like make a positive at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see this a lot in like pc </v>

3203
02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:03.314
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we start sort of bragging about your </v>

3204
02:12:05.690 --> 02:12:07.400
<v Speaker 3>victimization that things have happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you,</v>

3205
02:12:07.401 --> 02:12:08.234
<v Speaker 3>but like it's a way to stand out and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a special so that you ended up propping </v>

3206
02:12:11.841 --> 02:12:12.900
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3207
02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:16.340
<v Speaker 3>the negative up instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of saying,</v>

3208
02:12:16.341 --> 02:12:17.174
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was shitty.</v>

3209
02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:19.213
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you started almost like bragging about </v>

3210
02:12:20.211 --> 02:12:21.044
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3211
02:12:21.260 --> 02:12:24.620
<v Speaker 3>So you start feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well at least I'm different.</v>

3212
02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:26.053
<v Speaker 3>So that can prop you up a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least I'm unique in this thing of </v>

3213
02:12:28.491 --> 02:12:31.340
<v Speaker 3>like it doesn't seem like anyone else's </v>
<v Speaker 3>having these suicidal thoughts,</v>

3214
02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:33.700
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3215
02:12:35.090 --> 02:12:37.010
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like if you're only the only</v>
<v Speaker 3>one to do a band,</v>

3216
02:12:37.130 --> 02:12:39.470
<v Speaker 3>you feel better than if everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 3>into that same band.</v>

3217
02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:41.180
<v Speaker 3>The band is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the album is the album.</v>

3218
02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:43.460
<v Speaker 3>But you'd like it more because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>the only one,</v>

3219
02:12:43.870 --> 02:12:45.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The oldest in your own uniqueness.</v>

3220
02:12:45.891 --> 02:12:48.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like maybe it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really sure,</v>

3221
02:12:48.261 --> 02:12:49.094
<v Speaker 3>but when I was out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was missing it a little bit and </v>

3222
02:12:52.551 --> 02:12:55.310
<v Speaker 3>then followed by a fear that it's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to come back because regular,</v>

3223
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:57.110
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a terrible word.</v>

3224
02:12:57.111 --> 02:12:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Depression because it also means just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm depressed today.</v>

3225
02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Clinical depression is different but </v>
<v Speaker 3>overlaps,</v>

3226
02:13:03.260 --> 02:13:05.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't just go away if I'm depressed</v>

3227
02:13:05.691 --> 02:13:06.950
<v Speaker 3>because I'm cranky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to tell myself,</v>

3228
02:13:07.190 --> 02:13:08.570
<v Speaker 3>don't be cranky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say Five things.</v>

3229
02:13:08.571 --> 02:13:10.400
<v Speaker 3>You're thankful for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'll be out of it.</v>

3230
02:13:10.730 --> 02:13:11.810
<v Speaker 3>Get some sunshine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fine.</v>

3231
02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:16.160
<v Speaker 3>This is like deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like then when you do get depressed,</v>

3232
02:13:16.161 --> 02:13:18.080
<v Speaker 3>like let's just say I haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside all day.</v>

3233
02:13:18.081 --> 02:13:19.970
<v Speaker 3>It's been raining for two straight days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3234
02:13:19.971 --> 02:13:23.270
<v Speaker 3>he just a little like blue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

3235
02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:24.560
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it back?</v>

3236
02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:27.500
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when it's gone in a day like Oh</v>

3237
02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:28.513
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it's like two days like fuck </v>

3238
02:13:30.301 --> 02:13:31.160
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

3239
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:32.663
<v Speaker 1>don't come back.</v>

3240
02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3241
02:13:35.041 --> 02:13:38.370
<v Speaker 1>But the the so about like a bad weather </v>
<v Speaker 1>day could set it off a little bit.</v>

3242
02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:39.713
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just gives like the normal </v>

3243
02:13:40.171 --> 02:13:42.620
<v Speaker 1>depression that everybody gets right at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3244
02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I think there really should be two </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate terms.</v>

3245
02:13:44.611 --> 02:13:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Feeling Blue Fail and blue you get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't been on stage in four days.</v>

3246
02:13:49.261 --> 02:13:50.740
<v Speaker 1>I feel a little blue if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

3247
02:13:51.430 --> 02:13:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know if I can get my underwear </v>
<v Speaker 1>out all day too.</v>

3248
02:13:53.971 --> 02:13:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I can't live in Vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3249
02:13:55.771 --> 02:13:56.610
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3250
02:13:56.611 --> 02:13:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Those people get depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It don't go outside in Seattle.</v>

3251
02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:01.740
<v Speaker 1>They don't get outside while they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside where they get rained on.</v>

3252
02:14:01.770 --> 02:14:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just like he just feeling down.</v>

3253
02:14:04.290 --> 02:14:05.123
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Duncan and I were </v>
<v Speaker 1>filming something up there and we were </v>

3254
02:14:06.601 --> 02:14:07.434

<v Speaker 1>talking to this guy who was a cop who </v>

3255
02:14:09.811 --> 02:14:12.540
<v Speaker 1>was like the security guard for the set </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it fucking wears on you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he was at the end of like the rainy </v>

3258
02:14:17.041 --> 02:14:19.290

<v Speaker 1>The New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first New York went to was this one </v>

3260
02:14:21.930 --> 02:14:26.220
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't so much middle of March </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I was like,</v>

3261
02:14:26.221 --> 02:14:27.210
<v Speaker 1>whatever I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could take it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was middle of April where I'm like </v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the question is the want though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you could do what you want.</v>

3266
02:14:38.131 --> 02:14:39.360
<v Speaker 1>You could leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could leave.</v>

3267
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I went skiing a lot of 16 days of skiing</v>

<v Speaker 1>So much better.</v>

3272
02:14:49.231 --> 02:14:50.460
<v Speaker 1>When it's sunny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cold out,</v>

3273
02:14:50.461 --> 02:14:51.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sunny.</v>

3274
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have to pick warm and cloudy</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time or cold and sunny.</v>

3275
02:14:57.180 --> 02:14:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I take cold and sunny all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sunny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunny?</v>

3278
02:15:01.590 --> 02:15:02.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skiing outside of the sun when it's </v>

3279
02:15:03.481 --> 02:15:04.180
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3280
02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:05.640
<v Speaker 1>it's 25 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>

3281
02:15:05.641 --> 02:15:07.200
<v Speaker 1>you don't even walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3282
02:15:07.201 --> 02:15:11.130
<v Speaker 1>it's brisk out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look how pretty the sky is blue,</v>

3283
02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:12.113
<v Speaker 1>blue sky and fluffy clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know Anthony Bordain was was </v>

3284
02:15:15.331 --> 02:15:16.440
<v Speaker 1>depressed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3285
02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I heard with him a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a mixture of mixing drugs,</v>

3286
02:15:20.490 --> 02:15:22.980
<v Speaker 1>mixing pills and alcohol could have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer.</v>

3287
02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was on some sort of malaria</v>

3288
02:15:25.681 --> 02:15:26.514
<v Speaker 1>medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is dangerous if some people </v>

3289
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:30.743
<v Speaker 1>violent people get violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people on malaria medication </v>

3290
02:15:33.841 --> 02:15:34.674
<v Speaker 1>while they were drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had a hold the guy back from </v>

3291
02:15:36.871 --> 02:15:40.920
<v Speaker 1>attacking or the quarter or at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about him attacking a report.</v>

3292
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:42.583
<v Speaker 1>It was a friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very kind friend of mine who I </v>

3293
02:15:44.521 --> 02:15:45.354
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we'd ever in normal life </v>

3294
02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:50.250
<v Speaker 1>attack a person physically.</v>

3295
02:15:50.700 --> 02:15:53.700
<v Speaker 1>And it seemed like he was about to text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you think not even normal.</v>

3296
02:15:53.730 --> 02:15:55.220
<v Speaker 1>He was squirrely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3297
02:15:55.290 --> 02:15:57.180
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to go to Africa for,</v>

3298
02:15:57.220 --> 02:15:57.540
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3299
02:15:57.540 --> 02:15:58.373
<v Speaker 1>he had um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visit somewhere in Africa and he had to </v>

3300
02:16:00.541 --> 02:16:05.040
<v Speaker 1>take these pills and some of them have </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent reactions to people.</v>

3301
02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:06.630
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to drink on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all.</v>

3302
02:16:06.750 --> 02:16:08.160
<v Speaker 1>And he was drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mixing.</v>

3303
02:16:08.190 --> 02:16:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3304
02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:13.230
<v Speaker 1>if that's what he was doing and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixing that with alcohol,</v>

3305
02:16:13.231 --> 02:16:14.064
<v Speaker 1>who fucking knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that could have happened with board </v>

3306
02:16:15.471 --> 02:16:16.304
<v Speaker 1>and where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might not have been long term </v>

3307
02:16:16.771 --> 02:16:19.610
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know there's studies on people who</v>

3308
02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:22.590
<v Speaker 1>got a concussion in football practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then hung themselves at night.</v>

3309
02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No history of it.</v>

3310
02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:25.193
<v Speaker 1>But right then everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's almost like you're on </v>

3311
02:16:26.791 --> 02:16:29.560
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This new reality is real.</v>

3312
02:16:29.890 --> 02:16:30.723
<v Speaker 1>It feels real.</v>

3313
02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:34.870
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there something you could've done?</v>

3314
02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:38.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the right,</v>

3315
02:16:38.170 --> 02:16:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the right thing is.</v>

3316
02:16:39.851 --> 02:16:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Cause you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you push away people's help.</v>

3317
02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:42.753
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw somebody posted on facebook once </v>

3318
02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:46.473
<v Speaker 1>where it was like one of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about depression is everybody </v>

3319
02:16:47.831 --> 02:16:49.120
<v Speaker 1>going to key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been through that too.</v>

3320
02:16:49.121 --> 02:16:52.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like now I'm not even unique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3321
02:16:55.430 --> 02:16:57.700
<v Speaker 1>getting by props for my individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>substance.</v>

3322
02:16:57.720 --> 02:16:59.490
<v Speaker 1>So then it's like you want to help by </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody saying you,</v>

3323
02:16:59.500 --> 02:17:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I've been through this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

3324
02:17:00.521 --> 02:17:05.200
<v Speaker 1>it's not even helping them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like who the fuck knows what they're</v>

3325
02:17:05.201 --> 02:17:06.100
<v Speaker 1>feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3326
02:17:06.101 --> 02:17:08.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing about a person's </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings,</v>

3327
02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:10.210
<v Speaker 1>what they're feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very personal.</v>

3328
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:12.700
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible to describe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3329
02:17:12.701 --> 02:17:15.070
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had moderate depression.</v>

3330
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:18.910
<v Speaker 1>That's where the therapist said what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw was moderate depression.</v>

3331
02:17:19.090 --> 02:17:19.923
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what severe depression </v>

3332
02:17:21.191 --> 02:17:22.960
<v Speaker 1>looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

3333
02:17:23.650 --> 02:17:24.700
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3334
02:17:24.701 --> 02:17:26.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost somebody to,</v>

3335
02:17:26.081 --> 02:17:29.740
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if I could have said </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to her or like,</v>

3336
02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:31.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3337
02:17:31.630 --> 02:17:33.730
<v Speaker 1>anthony like to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drank a lot.</v>

3338
02:17:33.790 --> 02:17:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3339
02:17:34.810 --> 02:17:39.410
<v Speaker 1>watching him over the last four years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could see that he's,</v>

3340
02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:42.910
<v Speaker 1>he'd seemed like he had been living a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard life.</v>

3341
02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:46.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked like it on television too.</v>

3342
02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:48.670
<v Speaker 1>You've been living a hard life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3343
02:17:48.671 --> 02:17:52.450
<v Speaker 1>he was out there hitting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling from country to country,</v>

3344
02:17:52.451 --> 02:17:56.140
<v Speaker 1>constantly drinking constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol's a depressant.</v>

3345
02:17:56.280 --> 02:17:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you drink alcohol all the time,</v>

3346
02:17:58.781 --> 02:18:01.330
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to come out of it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sunny disposition as the president.</v>

3347
02:18:01.390 --> 02:18:02.410
<v Speaker 1>It is a depressant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3348
02:18:02.411 --> 02:18:04.210
<v Speaker 1>you can definitely do it and pull it </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

3349
02:18:04.211 --> 02:18:05.380
<v Speaker 1>And we do.</v>

3350
02:18:05.530 --> 02:18:06.363
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally you'll have a couple of </v>

3351
02:18:07.211 --> 02:18:10.540
<v Speaker 1>drinks and then the next day you won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're doing that all the time,</v>

3352
02:18:11.230 --> 02:18:13.870
<v Speaker 1>if you doing it every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five days a week,</v>

3353
02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:17.380
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people use that because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>short term relief from depression,</v>

3354
02:18:17.381 --> 02:18:18.214
<v Speaker 1>longterm depressant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people use alcoholism to </v>

3355
02:18:20.321 --> 02:18:22.150
<v Speaker 1>cover up the depression and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get clean.</v>

3356
02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:23.013
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly all the shit they're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have been dealing with is now still </v>

3357
02:18:24.791 --> 02:18:26.650
<v Speaker 1>there and not being covered up by </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

3358
02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3359
02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Fun that comes with a couple of drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3360
02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:32.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3361
02:18:32.861 --> 02:18:33.700
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

3362
02:18:33.701 --> 02:18:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Let's stop worrying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3363
02:18:34.900 --> 02:18:36.580
<v Speaker 1>It spends how addicted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

3364
02:18:36.670 --> 02:18:38.530
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could do that with cigarettes </v>
<v Speaker 1>when everybody's smoking,</v>

3365
02:18:38.650 --> 02:18:40.680
<v Speaker 1>but I'll go right back to a pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you do,</v>

3366
02:18:40.810 --> 02:18:44.170
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think like fuck,</v>

3367
02:18:44.171 --> 02:18:45.004
<v Speaker 1>what could I have done?</v>

3368
02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:46.113
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I wasn't close enough to them and </v>

3369
02:18:47.341 --> 02:18:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was there,</v>

3370
02:18:49.241 --> 02:18:51.390
<v Speaker 1>I would be tortured by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3371
02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:56.250
<v Speaker 1>If I was there and I was hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them and it happened in [inaudible]</v>

3372
02:18:56.390 --> 02:18:58.450
<v Speaker 1>you tomorrow and then I would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>tortured by that,</v>

3373
02:18:58.750 --> 02:19:02.110
<v Speaker 1>that would then with anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3374
02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:08.600
<v Speaker 1>it's just such a crazy decision to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the decision to just stop living when so</v>

3375
02:19:10.031 --> 02:19:12.460
<v Speaker 1>many people loved you and you have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy life that,</v>

3376
02:19:12.461 --> 02:19:14.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the bravest thing to me.</v>

3377
02:19:14.910 --> 02:19:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine it's,</v>

3378
02:19:16.610 --> 02:19:17.443
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only thing that held me back </v>

3379
02:19:18.311 --> 02:19:21.100
<v Speaker 1>is just the lack of courage to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do it.</v>

3380
02:19:21.130 --> 02:19:22.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it stop.</v>

3381
02:19:22.090 --> 02:19:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Your DNA is telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but stop and think about you.</v>

3382
02:19:24.911 --> 02:19:28.310
<v Speaker 1>What you've from not doing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>become wildly successful.</v>

3383
02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And way happier.</v>

3384
02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
<v Speaker 1>You're having a great fucking time at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great time.</v>

3385
02:19:33.060 --> 02:19:34.880
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the architect of my own happiness</v>

3386
02:19:34.940 --> 02:19:38.540
<v Speaker 1>and his fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it well while I'm doing myself</v>

3387
02:19:38.541 --> 02:19:40.010
<v Speaker 1>doing it the way you're supposed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3388
02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:41.720
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3389
02:19:41.721 --> 02:19:44.660
<v Speaker 1>you've been doing it like this for </v>
<v Speaker 1>several years now and if you,</v>

3390
02:19:44.990 --> 02:19:46.610
<v Speaker 1>I guess it really doesn't matter in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

3391
02:19:47.050 --> 02:19:47.883
<v Speaker 1>but if you end your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't ever experienced all this </v>

3392
02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:51.793
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you had to go back and do it </v>

3393
02:19:53.091 --> 02:19:54.050
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

3394
02:19:54.051 --> 02:19:55.440
<v Speaker 1>You were at like a tipping point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

3395
02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:59.330
<v Speaker 1>you're this like weird tipping point and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just went that way and you're free.</v>

3396
02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Just took a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely a struggle.</v>

3397
02:20:02.300 --> 02:20:03.133
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were free I find when talking to </v>

3398
02:20:05.361 --> 02:20:08.750
<v Speaker 1>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other comics because now I feel a little</v>

3399
02:20:08.751 --> 02:20:09.770
<v Speaker 1>guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3400
02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:13.880
<v Speaker 1>for success around around people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are also quite funny who don't have it.</v>

3401
02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:15.313
<v Speaker 1>And what I found is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get this frustrating point right </v>

3402
02:20:18.081 --> 02:20:18.741
<v Speaker 1>around eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

3403
02:20:18.741 --> 02:20:19.574
<v Speaker 1>10 12 years of comedy where like your </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills have gotten better and your </v>

3404
02:20:23.780 --> 02:20:26.030
<v Speaker 1>monetary career has not gotten better.</v>

3405
02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Seo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic careers booming and then you're</v>

3406
02:20:29.091 --> 02:20:31.580
<v Speaker 1>just not even making a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the most frustrating cause like</v>

3407
02:20:31.581 --> 02:20:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm finally good at open mic level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3408
02:20:33.971 --> 02:20:35.940
<v Speaker 1>or make a good joke that's a window and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

3409
02:20:36.410 --> 02:20:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I made a good joke tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this week or one time this month,</v>

3410
02:20:40.250 --> 02:20:41.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like they are,</v>

3411
02:20:41.871 --> 02:20:43.910
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm doing so well on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm killing,</v>

3412
02:20:43.911 --> 02:20:46.550
<v Speaker 1>why am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I still working this day job?</v>

3413
02:20:46.551 --> 02:20:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Why am I not even ever on TV?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I,</v>

3414
02:20:48.471 --> 02:20:50.210
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's real frustrating.</v>

3415
02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Might've been around that time too or </v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting frustrated with like,</v>

3416
02:20:53.540 --> 02:20:54.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was less hacky but also just not </v>

3417
02:20:56.061 --> 02:20:56.894
<v Speaker 1>succeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say an interesting how the Internet's </v>

3418
02:20:59.960 --> 02:21:04.700
<v Speaker 1>changed everything or for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can support people so much easier.</v>

3419
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Before it was like you had the man show </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could hire a writer and that's it.</v>

3420
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:12.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the only help you could do for </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

3421
02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3422
02:21:13.850 --> 02:21:15.740
<v Speaker 1>take a couple people on the road with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3423
02:21:16.610 --> 02:21:17.750
<v Speaker 1>but now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3424

<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

3432
02:21:31.101 --> 02:21:33.980
<v Speaker 1>if Tom Papa asked me to promote </v>
<v Speaker 1>something he's doing,</v>

02:21:33.981 --> 02:21:35.600
<v Speaker 1>I want people to go see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

3434
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:36.703
<v Speaker 1>It's good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to do good because I like </v>

3435
02:21:39.291 --> 02:21:40.730
<v Speaker 1>listening to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like watching them,</v>

3436
02:21:40.731 --> 02:21:43.670

<v Speaker 1>because I get to see you more.</v>

3438
02:21:45.021 --> 02:21:47.750
<v Speaker 1>I got to get to sell out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy person gets to stay in it.</v>

3439
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Not that he needs us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also will,</v>

3440
02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:54.120
<v Speaker 1>like with Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you tell people about someone who's</v>

3441
02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:56.060
<v Speaker 1>really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's you or whoever it is,</v>

3442
02:21:56.720 --> 02:21:57.860
<v Speaker 1>then they trust you.</v>

3443
02:21:57.920 --> 02:21:58.970
<v Speaker 1>They'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They know that you're telling the truth.</v>

3445
02:22:02.121 --> 02:22:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Like if I tell him,</v>

<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

02:22:20.390 --> 02:22:21.680
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3456
02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:25.830
<v Speaker 1>there's people that you could do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

3457
02:22:25.831 --> 02:22:27.180
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no,</v>

3458
02:22:27.210 --> 02:22:28.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before it was like you got on the </v>

3459
02:22:28.591 --> 02:22:29.970
<v Speaker 1>tonight show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3460
02:22:29.971 --> 02:22:33.330
<v Speaker 1>he did say that was an actual times that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a letterman people talked about.</v>

3461
02:22:33.331 --> 02:22:34.164
<v Speaker 1>You had to build up places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to travel to places all the </v>

3462
02:22:36.241 --> 02:22:36.540
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3463
02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:39.090
<v Speaker 1>So those people would come back every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time they came back.</v>

3464
02:22:39.091 --> 02:22:42.270
<v Speaker 1>You better have some new shit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really got to think about it.</v>

3465
02:22:42.670 --> 02:22:45.600
<v Speaker 1>I have like when you start saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression of people,</v>

3466
02:22:45.601 --> 02:22:48.210
<v Speaker 1>like what can you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody do?</v>

3467
02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:49.433
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything anybody can do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like just a little bit like being </v>

3468
02:22:52.021 --> 02:22:56.730
<v Speaker 1>there for you sometimes is like helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just be like,</v>

3469
02:22:57.060 --> 02:22:58.560
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just your good friend.</v>

3470
02:22:58.561 --> 02:22:59.394
<v Speaker 1>I know you're going through something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just know that I like you just like </v>

3471
02:23:01.111 --> 02:23:03.030
<v Speaker 1>a little bit and don't require anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

3472
02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:05.880
<v Speaker 1>But I guess everybody be different too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

3473
02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

3474
02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's on a different trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

3475
02:23:11.641 --> 02:23:13.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like no one knows what anyone is </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>

3476
02:23:13.950 --> 02:23:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Telling somebody to get over it is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to do it.</v>

3477
02:23:16.590 --> 02:23:17.730
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ain't gonna help.</v>

3478
02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:21.060
<v Speaker 1>The tough love thing is like that.</v>

3479
02:23:21.300 --> 02:23:23.820
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That works for fucking nothing.</v>

3480
02:23:23.850 --> 02:23:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it works for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not that it works for lazy people.</v>

3481
02:23:26.780 --> 02:23:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it works for them.</v>

3482
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:29.543
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think it works for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that gets people to move </v>

3483
02:23:32.101 --> 02:23:33.960
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't change the way they think</v>

3484
02:23:33.961 --> 02:23:35.830
<v Speaker 1>about what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just get forced into doing,</v>

3485
02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:37.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the argument,</v>

3486
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:41.340
<v Speaker 1>well actually not like that when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to say,</v>

3487
02:23:42.270 --> 02:23:44.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you.</v>

3488
02:23:44.161 --> 02:23:48.060
<v Speaker 1>You want them to act and so they act </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of force of your your will.</v>

3489
02:23:48.380 --> 02:23:50.480
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to scare them into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3490
02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:52.770
<v Speaker 1>but if you inspire someone and say to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

3491
02:23:52.771 --> 02:23:54.630
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're looking at it this way.</v>

3492
02:23:54.980 --> 02:23:57.930
<v Speaker 1>This is why this is going to hurt you by</v>
<v Speaker 1>approaching it this way.</v>

3493
02:23:57.960 --> 02:23:58.793
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But instead of approaching it the way </v>

3494
02:24:00.601 --> 02:24:01.830
<v Speaker 1>you're approaching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

3495
02:24:02.010 --> 02:24:04.890
<v Speaker 1>And just for a shifted perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it in a positive way.</v>

3496
02:24:04.891 --> 02:24:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Like you could do that to people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you can actually shift the way</v>

3497
02:24:07.681 --> 02:24:08.514
<v Speaker 1>they look at something because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times it's the way you're approaching </v>

3498
02:24:10.201 --> 02:24:11.670
<v Speaker 1>something that's pissing you off about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3499
02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:12.893
<v Speaker 1>And the way to get through sometimes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people is not to tell them this is the </v>

3500
02:24:15.151 --> 02:24:15.984
<v Speaker 1>way you should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just to paint the picture and let </v>

3501
02:24:17.911 --> 02:24:19.390
<v Speaker 1>them make their own decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3502
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:20.301
<v Speaker 1>To be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh sir,</v>

3503
02:24:20.301 --> 02:24:21.840
<v Speaker 1>you're happy when you're run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3504
02:24:22.050 --> 02:24:22.883
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

3505
02:24:23.070 --> 02:24:24.060
<v Speaker 1>is it warm out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3506
02:24:24.061 --> 02:24:24.894
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3507
02:24:25.170 --> 02:24:25.971
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're less happening.</v>

3508
02:24:25.971 --> 02:24:27.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3509
02:24:27.170 --> 02:24:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Well was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of be like,</v>

3510
02:24:30.271 --> 02:24:31.800
<v Speaker 1>you got to get out there and run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3511
02:24:31.801 --> 02:24:34.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have kids raising kids.</v>

3512
02:24:34.231 --> 02:24:35.064
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I learned that </v>
<v Speaker 1>works really good is anytime they do </v>

3513
02:24:37.771 --> 02:24:38.604
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell them I fucked up way worse than </v>

3514
02:24:39.961 --> 02:24:40.170
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3515
02:24:40.170 --> 02:24:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't use word fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

3516
02:24:41.610 --> 02:24:43.500
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you've done,</v>

3517
02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I've messed up way more like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody messes up.</v>

3518
02:24:47.610 --> 02:24:48.443
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a part of being a kid and I'm </v>

3519
02:24:50.580 --> 02:24:54.090
<v Speaker 1>super proud of you for admitting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you made a mistake or that you did this.</v>

3520
02:24:54.091 --> 02:24:55.860
<v Speaker 1>This is great because this is how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>

3521
02:24:55.861 --> 02:24:56.694
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're eight years old or you're 10 </v>

3522
02:24:58.501 --> 02:25:01.530
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to be learning,</v>

3523
02:25:01.590 --> 02:25:02.423
<v Speaker 1>learning about life and people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be talking to you about </v>

3524
02:25:04.591 --> 02:25:05.424
<v Speaker 1>various things you encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't supposed to already know </v>

3525
02:25:06.961 --> 02:25:07.980
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a little kid.</v>

3526
02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:08.873
<v Speaker 1>This is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we learned something that we don't </v>

3527
02:25:10.051 --> 02:25:11.460
<v Speaker 1>want to do anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is great.</v>

3528
02:25:11.490 --> 02:25:13.680
<v Speaker 1>This is an awesome opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And nobody,</v>

3529
02:25:13.681 --> 02:25:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I wish somebody talked to me like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I will tell them that too.</v>

3530
02:25:16.561 --> 02:25:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I go cause I get called stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yelled at or whatever.</v>

3531
02:25:19.831 --> 02:25:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck it was when I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

3532
02:25:21.181 --> 02:25:23.200
<v Speaker 1>This is how people talk to kids back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they didn't,</v>

3533
02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:24.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not</v>

3534
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:26.470
<v Speaker 5>even anybody's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So does something dumb.</v>

3535
02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:28.690
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the 1960s or something like that.</v>

3536
02:25:28.691 --> 02:25:30.250
<v Speaker 5>They threw things at them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3537
02:25:30.251 --> 02:25:31.084
<v Speaker 5>like my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my parents were telling me about things </v>

3538
02:25:31.931 --> 02:25:34.130
<v Speaker 5>flying across the room at them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3539
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:36.490
<v Speaker 5>like people might stop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just fucking that little,</v>

3540
02:25:36.610 --> 02:25:39.010
<v Speaker 5>the kids were animals back then too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3541
02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:42.630
<v Speaker 5>people are different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3542
02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:43.553
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I might be that like something that </v>

3543
02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:47.380
<v Speaker 5>helped me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if people are listening are</v>

3544
02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:49.420
<v Speaker 5>going through it or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like some things that will help that</v>

3545
02:25:49.421 --> 02:25:53.350
<v Speaker 5>I was able to take was I had one </v>
<v Speaker 5>therapist said one good thing where it's</v>

3546
02:25:53.351 --> 02:25:56.050
<v Speaker 5>like imagine the good things out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>depression.</v>

3547
02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:57.153
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Instead of looking at it as only </v>

3548
02:25:57.761 --> 02:25:59.360
<v Speaker 5>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it'll try that.</v>

3551
02:26:02.471 --> 02:26:03.304
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at my standup material more </v>

3552
02:26:04.901 --> 02:26:09.220
<v Speaker 5>realistically and darker and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually helpful on stage.</v>

3553
02:26:10.090 --> 02:26:10.541
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's one good thing out of this.</v>

3555
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:15.310
<v Speaker 5>And then it just like sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might just help you like it's not all</v>

3556
02:26:15.311 --> 02:26:17.290
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Adjust the way you approach it.</v>

3557
02:26:17.350 --> 02:26:18.183
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Another thing was say five things and </v>

02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:23.493
<v Speaker 5>say five things out loud that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>thankful for doesn't have to be </v>

3560
02:26:26.921 --> 02:26:29.710
<v Speaker 5>monumental stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like it's 75 today.</v>

3561
02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:31.000
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3562
02:26:31.420 --> 02:26:33.550
<v Speaker 5>I got a new bar soap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

3563
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:35.790
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3564
02:26:35.890 --> 02:26:37.000
<v Speaker 5>my friend John,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3565
02:26:37.001 --> 02:26:38.050
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:39.190
<v Speaker 5>I like him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

3567
02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:40.193
<v Speaker 5>Glad to have that in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just five things to say it out loud and </v>

3568
02:26:41.801 --> 02:26:44.770
<v Speaker 5>then after a while sometimes that that </v>
<v Speaker 5>that ended up like affecting my mood,</v>

3569
02:26:46.180 --> 02:26:47.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where instead of,</v>

3570
02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:48.880
<v Speaker 5>cause that was the problem was the </v>
<v Speaker 5>focus.</v>

3571
02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:51.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I ever told you this </v>
<v Speaker 5>focus on negative things.</v>

3572
02:26:51.730 --> 02:26:53.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it'd be like a 75 degree day.</v>

3573
02:26:53.351 --> 02:26:55.900
<v Speaker 5>This is the example I use 75 degrees and</v>
<v Speaker 5>sunny.</v>

3574
02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:58.420
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking every day in La,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3575
02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:00.573
<v Speaker 5>And I would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of going like this is fucking </v>

3576
02:27:01.721 --> 02:27:02.554
<v Speaker 5>Rad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's February 12th and I am fucking in </v>

3577
02:27:05.441 --> 02:27:06.580
<v Speaker 5>shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is great.</v>

3578
02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:09.020
<v Speaker 5>Instead of focusing in that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would focus on like fuck,</v>

3579
02:27:09.021 --> 02:27:11.110
<v Speaker 5>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got my car has no gas,</v>

3580
02:27:11.111 --> 02:27:14.410
<v Speaker 5>I got to fucking go kick gas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate having to fucking get gas.</v>

3581
02:27:14.411 --> 02:27:15.244
<v Speaker 5>You got to pull over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then I'm only focusing on this </v>

3582
02:27:16.871 --> 02:27:17.704
<v Speaker 5>fucking one minute chore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I have to do instead of on all the </v>

3583
02:27:22.031 --> 02:27:24.250
<v Speaker 5>good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you just focus,</v>

3584
02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:27.640
<v Speaker 5>it just makes you focus on this negative</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's just like can't pull out of it.</v>

3585
02:27:27.641 --> 02:27:32.641
<v Speaker 5>So anything you can do to like shift the</v>
<v Speaker 5>focus to the positive is helpful.</v>

3586
02:27:33.730 --> 02:27:36.930
<v Speaker 5>Do you know Tony Vee is standup comics </v>
<v Speaker 5>and bosses?</v>

3587
02:27:38.130 --> 02:27:39.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm a part of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very,</v>

3588
02:27:39.230 --> 02:27:40.063
<v Speaker 5>very funny guy.</v>

3589
02:27:42.070 --> 02:27:42.903
<v Speaker 5>Said something to me once about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was driving from New York to Boston </v>

3590
02:27:45.671 --> 02:27:48.040
<v Speaker 5>back and forth like multiple times in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>week.</v>

3591
02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:49.811
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's a long ass drive.</v>

3593
02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:52.721
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3594
02:27:52.721 --> 02:27:54.760
<v Speaker 5>but I just go zen and I just tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>myself,</v>

3595
02:27:54.761 --> 02:27:56.170
<v Speaker 5>this is what I'm doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3596
02:27:56.171 --> 02:27:57.190
<v Speaker 5>I just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3597
02:27:57.510 --> 02:27:58.870
<v Speaker 5>But I thought about that and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3598
02:27:58.871 --> 02:27:59.704
<v Speaker 5>why don't you just do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just say this is what I'm doing right </v>

3599
02:28:01.331 --> 02:28:04.260
<v Speaker 5>now instead of like going fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't believe to drive this thing.</v>

3600
02:28:04.261 --> 02:28:05.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So fucking long.</v>

3601
02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:06.633
<v Speaker 5>What if I fall asleep?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you make yourself think about it </v>

3602
02:28:08.410 --> 02:28:09.910
<v Speaker 5>positively.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking hard.</v>

3603
02:28:10.030 --> 02:28:11.830
<v Speaker 5>Somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I told all my norm,</v>

3604
02:28:11.970 --> 02:28:14.410
<v Speaker 5>norm core people about like start doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>commercials and then they're like,</v>

3605
02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:15.470
<v Speaker 5>how does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

3606
02:28:15.471 --> 02:28:17.200
<v Speaker 5>can you give an agent given 10% like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3607
02:28:17.890 --> 02:28:20.380
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't go to the auditions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't you hate giving a 10% you know,</v>

3608
02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:22.190
<v Speaker 5>and you probably this too from people.</v>

3609
02:28:22.430 --> 02:28:23.990
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3610
02:28:23.991 --> 02:28:25.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking like that.</v>

3611
02:28:25.431 --> 02:28:27.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like I wouldn't get the auditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>without them.</v>

3612
02:28:27.870 --> 02:28:29.630
<v Speaker 1>That is nothing compared to what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

3613
02:28:29.930 --> 02:28:33.110
<v Speaker 1>You want a bunch of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people don't understand.</v>

3614
02:28:33.230 --> 02:28:35.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's like don't focus on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative shit.</v>

3615
02:28:35.061 --> 02:28:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Focusing on the 90% like I wasn't even a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing like 20 feet sounds like.</v>

3616
02:28:38.151 --> 02:28:40.130
<v Speaker 1>What's not even thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this is such a sucky thing.</v>

3617
02:28:40.310 --> 02:28:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Well he just had a great way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>approaching it.</v>

3618
02:28:41.871 --> 02:28:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm doing right now.</v>

3619
02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:45.500
<v Speaker 1>So this is what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can emulate those people,</v>

3620
02:28:45.501 --> 02:28:46.430
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

3621
02:28:46.431 --> 02:28:47.264
<v Speaker 1>Light them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's like help you move the needle </v>

3622
02:28:49.251 --> 02:28:51.020
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3623
02:28:51.140 --> 02:28:53.600
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that one day you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>

3624
02:28:53.601 --> 02:28:55.880
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boulders too hard today.</v>

3625
02:28:56.440 --> 02:28:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you got like one nicer thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

3626
02:28:59.290 --> 02:29:00.200
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can withstand it.</v>

3627
02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And that was the day you were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>commit suicide.</v>

3628
02:29:01.671 --> 02:29:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it'll just like last you through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a culture of,</v>

3629
02:29:05.781 --> 02:29:06.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3630
02:29:06.890 --> 02:29:07.723
<v Speaker 1>attacking and trying to destroy people </v>
<v Speaker 1>today that didn't exist before and that </v>

3631
02:29:11.001 --> 02:29:12.070
<v Speaker 1>can affect your mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3632
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:14.900
<v Speaker 1>I think we're seeing that with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3633
02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:17.160
<v Speaker 1>people in the news and when people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3634
02:29:17.690 --> 02:29:20.990
<v Speaker 1>the thing about that lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm the little kid,</v>

3635
02:29:20.991 --> 02:29:22.760
<v Speaker 1>the little eight year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's calling the cops on him.</v>

3636
02:29:23.310 --> 02:29:26.180
<v Speaker 1>The thing that bummed me out the most is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they didn't accept her apology.</v>

3637
02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3638
02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:27.380
<v Speaker 1>c'mon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c'mon.</v>

3639
02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:28.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that brought me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll send,</v>

3640
02:29:28.291 --> 02:29:30.560
<v Speaker 1>I'll start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What she did was gross for sure,</v>

3641
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:33.740
<v Speaker 1>but we want people to just suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

3642
02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:34.633
<v Speaker 1>Like the pain that lady must've felt </v>
<v Speaker 1>from all those thousands of emails and </v>

3643
02:29:37.881 --> 02:29:41.050
<v Speaker 1>hate tweets she got from ratting out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that little kid that,</v>

3644
02:29:41.370 --> 02:29:43.120
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to pile on it.</v>

3645
02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:44.600
<v Speaker 1>She got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got it.</v>

3646
02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:46.610
<v Speaker 1>She got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And does is good for everybody.</v>

3647
02:29:46.611 --> 02:29:47.444
<v Speaker 1>That's good for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what else is good for </v>

3648
02:29:48.471 --> 02:29:49.130
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3649
02:29:49.130 --> 02:29:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Forgiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgiveness as good if someone asks.</v>

3650
02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3769
02:34:22.780 --> 02:34:24.430
<v Speaker 1>He's touching both of them at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3770
02:34:24.431 --> 02:34:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Lefthand and the dude right hand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

3771
02:34:26.141 --> 02:34:29.860
<v Speaker 1>he's like transmitting through them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving them orgasms.</v>

3772
02:34:29.861 --> 02:34:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3773
02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:33.070

<v Speaker 1>They believed in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

02:34:35.741 --> 02:34:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and pitch the crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen any of this Jamie?</v>

3777
02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:42.220
<v Speaker 1>I think I turned it on and fell asleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>and having to tell you.</v>

3778
02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:46.180
<v Speaker 1>You believe that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

3779
02:34:46.181 --> 02:34:47.590
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3780
02:34:47.591 --> 02:34:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on episode four now and I don't want</v>

3781
02:34:49.991 --> 02:34:51.740
<v Speaker 1>to give anything away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3782
02:34:51.750 --> 02:34:53.320
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like how it goes down,</v>

3783
02:34:53.321 --> 02:34:57.820
<v Speaker 1>but it literally keeps ramping up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting more and more fucking insane.</v>

3784
02:34:58.290 --> 02:34:58.930
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

3785
02:34:58.930 --> 02:34:59.763
<v Speaker 1>I'm like what Ari said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I didn't hear about </v>

3786
02:35:01.421 --> 02:35:03.520
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we know about Jones town?</v>

3787
02:35:03.550 --> 02:35:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows don't drink the Koolaid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an Oregon outside of antelope,</v>

3788
02:35:08.081 --> 02:35:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Oregon too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3789
02:35:10.090 --> 02:35:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't give too much away,</v>

3790
02:35:12.310 --> 02:35:15.520
<v Speaker 1>but these people bought a town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bought the whole town.</v>

3791
02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:19.540
<v Speaker 1>They got a police force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they have their own police force?</v>

3792
02:35:20.470 --> 02:35:23.710
<v Speaker 1>What are the odds that something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is going on now?</v>

3793
02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:25.113
<v Speaker 1>It's super low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super low because what this is is </v>

3794
02:35:27.250 --> 02:35:28.083
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the government had stepped in and </v>

3795
02:35:30.341 --> 02:35:33.040
<v Speaker 1>realize that there's some shenanigans </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on and they were essentially,</v>

3796
02:35:33.041 --> 02:35:36.100
<v Speaker 1>there was no separation of church and </v>
<v Speaker 1>state because the church was the state,</v>

3797
02:35:36.370 --> 02:35:37.203
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a government and police force </v>

3798
02:35:38.950 --> 02:35:39.783
<v Speaker 1>that was run by the church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They called it a peace force and the </v>

3799
02:35:42.911 --> 02:35:43.744
<v Speaker 1>whole cult basically ran the town except</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a few diehards who didn't want to </v>

3800
02:35:47.471 --> 02:35:48.460
<v Speaker 1>give their houses up.</v>

3801
02:35:48.610 --> 02:35:51.400
<v Speaker 1>So there was some folks who had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in antelope their whole life.</v>

3802
02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:52.533
<v Speaker 1>They didn't give their houses up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're telling the story and they did </v>

3803
02:35:54.941 --> 02:35:57.550
<v Speaker 1>not care for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking amazing,</v>

3804
02:35:57.551 --> 02:35:59.740
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So jealous of you of having not seen the</v>

3805
02:35:59.741 --> 02:36:01.960
<v Speaker 1>whole next call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is another one,</v>

3806
02:36:01.961 --> 02:36:02.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different one.</v>

3807
02:36:02.851 --> 02:36:04.920
<v Speaker 1>It's the one with the actress that got </v>
<v Speaker 1>calories.</v>

3808
02:36:04.950 --> 02:36:05.783
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a similar type cult things that </v>

3809
02:36:08.321 --> 02:36:09.940
<v Speaker 1>deal with that actress?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3810
02:36:10.220 --> 02:36:12.580
<v Speaker 1>She did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She really recruit people knowing it was</v>

3811
02:36:12.581 --> 02:36:14.710
<v Speaker 1>a sex cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the same thing.</v>

3812
02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:16.113
<v Speaker 1>I don't have as many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know much about this sex cult </v>

3813
02:36:17.891 --> 02:36:19.340
<v Speaker 1>thing with that actress lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3814
02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:23.770
<v Speaker 1>the whole story starts branding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were branding people but she was,</v>

3815
02:36:23.980 --> 02:36:28.210
<v Speaker 1>she was a part of it and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>recruiting people into allegedly this is</v>

3816
02:36:28.211 --> 02:36:30.830
<v Speaker 1>what they're charging or what I feel is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more to the story than I did.</v>

3817
02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:33.220
<v Speaker 1>I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man,</v>

3818
02:36:33.221 --> 02:36:37.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's weird that people are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to cults and that we protect</v>

3819
02:36:37.211 --> 02:36:39.850
<v Speaker 1>people from cults but don't protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from religions.</v>

3820
02:36:40.180 --> 02:36:41.013
<v Speaker 1>It's the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only difference is this one guy is </v>

3821
02:36:43.631 --> 02:36:46.030
<v Speaker 1>banging all these people and we got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop that.</v>

3822
02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:48.813
<v Speaker 1>There was sex crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like teen trafficking and </v>

3823
02:36:50.801 --> 02:36:51.640
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

3824
02:36:51.670 --> 02:36:54.520
<v Speaker 1>there was illegal things that were done </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this particular one,</v>

3825
02:36:54.610 --> 02:36:56.440
<v Speaker 1>from what I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know too much about it,</v>

3826
02:36:56.650 --> 02:37:01.180
<v Speaker 1>but then when you go to that Osho guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seemed,</v>

3827
02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:02.553
<v Speaker 1>except for church and state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the thing is the church started </v>

3828
02:37:04.691 --> 02:37:05.524
<v Speaker 1>running the police force remember and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had these guys walking around with </v>

3829
02:37:08.501 --> 02:37:10.520
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3830
02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:13.900
<v Speaker 1>semi automatic rifles and the high </v>
<v Speaker 1>powered machine guns and shit.</v>

3831
02:37:14.050 --> 02:37:15.620
<v Speaker 1>It was very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

3832
02:37:15.650 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've</v>

3833
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:19.680
<v Speaker 2>got a military force that's guarding </v>
<v Speaker 2>this religious leader.</v>

3834
02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:21.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had these police people at the </v>

3835
02:37:22.761 --> 02:37:25.400
<v Speaker 2>compound in the hallways with machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>

3836
02:37:25.401 --> 02:37:28.790
<v Speaker 2>These guys are playing assassin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they are the police force or not.</v>

3837
02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Then a private.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3838
02:37:30.410 --> 02:37:31.191
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's it called?</v>

3839
02:37:31.191 --> 02:37:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give any more away.</v>

3840
02:37:33.171 --> 02:37:35.420
<v Speaker 2>I just want to watch my watch and by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

3841
02:37:35.421 --> 02:37:37.640
<v Speaker 2>everything I've said is not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take anything away from sure.</v>

3842
02:37:37.700 --> 02:37:38.533
<v Speaker 2>With the girlfriend or your boyfriend or</v>
<v Speaker 2>your wife or whatever tool you're </v>

3843
02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:42.020
<v Speaker 2>neighbors with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody together.</v>

3844
02:37:42.021 --> 02:37:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Let's just like find somebody to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3845
02:37:43.731 --> 02:37:45.470
<v Speaker 2>let's watch it one episode every two </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

3846
02:37:45.471 --> 02:37:47.330
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh it's so fun.</v>

3847
02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I think an independent version of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in little blips.</v>

3848
02:37:51.950 --> 02:37:52.783
<v Speaker 2>What goes on with burning man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just independent little blip of </v>

3849
02:37:56.121 --> 02:37:59.900
<v Speaker 2>escape of norms of regular society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these people get there and they were</v>

3850
02:37:59.901 --> 02:38:00.734
<v Speaker 2>fucking gas masks and fuck each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go crazy and do cartwheels in the </v>

3851
02:38:03.381 --> 02:38:07.940
<v Speaker 2>dirt and they hang out together having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>great time and they realized that people</v>

3852
02:38:07.980 --> 02:38:11.330
<v Speaker 2>in at least in small bursts can </v>
<v Speaker 2>establish these communities,</v>

3853
02:38:11.331 --> 02:38:13.820
<v Speaker 2>set up all this temporary art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a great time.</v>

3854
02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:15.350
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3855
02:38:15.351 --> 02:38:16.184
<v Speaker 2>really like likeminded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know a lot of ways hanging out in this </v>

3856
02:38:17.901 --> 02:38:19.020
<v Speaker 2>one place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3857
02:38:19.021 --> 02:38:21.740
<v Speaker 2>if that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people want that,</v>

3858
02:38:22.460 --> 02:38:23.293
<v Speaker 2>the only difference between that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a fulltime community is that you </v>

3859
02:38:28.401 --> 02:38:33.260
<v Speaker 2>would have to figure out a way to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody to get along forever.</v>

3860
02:38:33.690 --> 02:38:35.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could just be a few days.</v>

3861
02:38:35.781 --> 02:38:38.810
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to have raised kids together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get your food together,</v>

3862
02:38:38.910 --> 02:38:40.850
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the food have all other jobs.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3864
02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:44.450
<v Speaker 2>But if you tried to do that today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would stop you.</v>

3865
02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Or at least it would become a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

3866
02:38:46.221 --> 02:38:47.054
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say if you decided you and Donkin got </v>

3867
02:38:48.381 --> 02:38:53.381
<v Speaker 2>together and you two decided to buy 700 </v>
<v Speaker 2>acres in Oregon and you found some place</v>

3868
02:38:53.751 --> 02:38:54.584
<v Speaker 2>that you could all afford.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did a kickstarter and you guys set </v>

3869
02:38:56.661 --> 02:38:57.500
<v Speaker 2>up a community out there.</v>

3870
02:38:57.500 --> 02:38:59.480
<v Speaker 2>You grew your own food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had your own,</v>

3871
02:38:59.481 --> 02:39:02.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody can be married and you could fuck</v>

3872
02:39:02.361 --> 02:39:04.130
<v Speaker 2>anybody you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just how we live in.</v>

3873
02:39:04.410 --> 02:39:06.020
<v Speaker 2>That's how we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you just,</v>

3874
02:39:06.021 --> 02:39:08.810
<v Speaker 2>you just rent and you like real loosely </v>
<v Speaker 2>based rules.</v>

3875
02:39:08.811 --> 02:39:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you eat something,</v>

3876

<v Speaker 2>clean up your mess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant mess halls filled with people.</v>

3877
02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:16.270
<v Speaker 2>People have these houses all over this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking ranch and you,</v>

3878
02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:18.650
<v Speaker 2>you basically established a village.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

02:39:19.230 --> 02:39:20.990
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just can't go too far.</v>

3880
02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:21.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then we started getting money from </v>

3881
02:39:23.151 --> 02:39:25.580
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the subway and when somebody breaks</v>

3882
02:39:25.581 --> 02:39:27.790
<v Speaker 2>the real law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a rape or murder,</v>

3883
02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:28.770
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3884
02:39:28.780 --> 02:39:29.810
<v Speaker 2>we need to call them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3885
02:39:29.811 --> 02:39:32.260
<v Speaker 2>You have to call the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way to keep it on file.</v>

3886
02:39:32.780 --> 02:39:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to keep it legit.</v>

3887
02:39:34.610 --> 02:39:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd have to still be under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>jurisdiction.</v>

3888
02:39:36.350 --> 02:39:38.420
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to make friends with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>local sheriffs.</v>

3889
02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:40.450
<v Speaker 2>That's you'd have to do just like we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

3890
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:41.720
<v Speaker 2>we don't mean any harm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when we,</v>

3891
02:39:41.780 --> 02:39:43.220
<v Speaker 2>when we need you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when something happens,</v>

3892
02:39:43.221 --> 02:39:44.054
<v Speaker 2>we'll call you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But otherwise we're not going to need </v>

3893
02:39:45.231 --> 02:39:45.620
<v Speaker 2>your much.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think each other like crazy skit </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting fucking wild up here,</v>

3896
02:39:52.341 --> 02:39:53.780
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we do.</v>

3897
02:39:53.781 --> 02:39:54.550
<v Speaker 2>It's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3898
02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:57.020
<v Speaker 2>It's still leave it a fucking America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I pay taxes,</v>

3899
02:39:57.250 --> 02:39:58.100
<v Speaker 2>so my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

3900
02:39:58.190 --> 02:40:01.310
<v Speaker 2>my best buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife can suck my balls.</v>

3901
02:40:01.540 --> 02:40:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Ass fucking him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3902
02:40:02.471 --> 02:40:03.690
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3903
02:40:04.070 --> 02:40:05.690
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She likes to suck ball right next to the</v>

3904
02:40:05.691 --> 02:40:08.290
<v Speaker 2>boot heel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a,</v>

3905
02:40:08.300 --> 02:40:09.133
<v Speaker 2>you would run into problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would decide that you shouldn't </v>

3906
02:40:11.211 --> 02:40:14.340
<v Speaker 2>be living like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want angry with everything</v>

3907
02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:15.810
<v Speaker 1>based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's with everything.</v>

3908
02:40:15.811 --> 02:40:16.644
<v Speaker 1>You're not living the way I live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not going to let anyone be into </v>

3909
02:40:19.051 --> 02:40:20.780
<v Speaker 1>your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3910
02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:22.500
<v Speaker 1>But it's always like one dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3911
02:40:22.501 --> 02:40:25.890
<v Speaker 1>That's running things and I'm one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those compounds.</v>

3912
02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:27.273
<v Speaker 1>Faults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always like a main guy who </v>

3913
02:40:27.841 --> 02:40:29.820
<v Speaker 1>fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody fucks everybody's wife.</v>

3914
02:40:30.030 --> 02:40:30.930
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck everybody you want.</v>

3915
02:40:30.931 --> 02:40:32.510
<v Speaker 1>But you probably want to fuck me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It caught on the main dude.</v>

3916
02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:35.160
<v Speaker 1>The only way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly to do at burning man style.</v>

3917
02:40:35.161 --> 02:40:38.100
<v Speaker 1>This is my point is that burning man </v>
<v Speaker 1>style would be no leader.</v>

3918
02:40:38.610 --> 02:40:39.660
<v Speaker 1>No leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3919
02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:42.120
<v Speaker 1>no leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So likeminded people,</v>

3920
02:40:42.121 --> 02:40:43.670
<v Speaker 1>no leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd have to fake,</v>

3921
02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:46.920
<v Speaker 1>the problem is charismatic people could </v>
<v Speaker 1>co op that they'd have these meetings.</v>

3922
02:40:46.921 --> 02:40:49.060
<v Speaker 1>One person takes over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what we need here.</v>

3923
02:40:49.061 --> 02:40:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Some organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next thing you know he's the king.</v>

3924
02:40:51.230 --> 02:40:52.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how people do.</v>

3925
02:40:52.590 --> 02:40:53.423
<v Speaker 1>We're monkeys.</v>

3926
02:40:54.020 --> 02:40:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we could avoid that though.</v>

3927
02:40:55.950 --> 02:40:57.810
<v Speaker 1>You crave leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3928
02:40:57.811 --> 02:41:02.070
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to somehow or another find a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to not manipulate the way.</v>

3929
02:41:02.260 --> 02:41:03.720
<v Speaker 1>What's his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a seat laws,</v>

3930
02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:04.561
<v Speaker 1>are they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3931
02:41:04.561 --> 02:41:07.650
<v Speaker 1>they're not the sex cult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are like,</v>

3932
02:41:07.651 --> 02:41:09.750
<v Speaker 1>everyone has a job we're all working </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

3933
02:41:09.780 --> 02:41:11.850
<v Speaker 1>nobody makes money here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody makes 20 bucks a week.</v>

3934
02:41:11.851 --> 02:41:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3935
02:41:12.841 --> 02:41:16.020
<v Speaker 1>room and board is paid for and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes people feel really good.</v>

3936
02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing an equal part.</v>

3937
02:41:18.540 --> 02:41:20.490
<v Speaker 1>One guy could be running the accounting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the thing.</v>

3938
02:41:20.491 --> 02:41:21.520
<v Speaker 1>One guy could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3939
02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:24.060
<v Speaker 1>taking eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3940
02:41:24.061 --> 02:41:26.430
<v Speaker 1>one person takes care of the nursery of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids,</v>

3941
02:41:27.300 --> 02:41:28.133

<v Speaker 1>driving around on jet skis and this is </v>

<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let me,</v>

3994
02:43:46.210 --> 02:43:50.200
<v Speaker 2>let me get ahold of Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I know will know the right people.</v>

3995
02:43:50.250 --> 02:43:53.050
<v Speaker 2>I think I see people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't tell me anything.</v>

3996
02:43:53.320 --> 02:43:54.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were like,</v>

3997
02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:56.320
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like you were,</v>

3998
02:43:56.350 --> 02:44:01.350
<v Speaker 2>you're such a non complainer that I knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I always tell people this story,</v>

3999
02:44:02.381 --> 02:44:04.750
<v Speaker 2>we were playing pool and Ari's limping </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the table.</v>

4000
02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:06.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck happened to your leg man?</v>

4001
02:44:07.160 --> 02:44:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Fucking spider bite or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

4002
02:44:08.591 --> 02:44:10.330
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see your fucking leg.</v>

4003
02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:14.260
<v Speaker 2>And he pulls his pants up like a dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to go to the hospital right now.</v>

4004
02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:18.670
<v Speaker 2>You have a very bad staph infection and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this could fucking kill you.</v>

4005
02:44:18.950 --> 02:44:19.481
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

4006
02:44:19.481 --> 02:44:21.730
<v Speaker 2>you're joking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I start unscrewing my cue and Mike,</v>

4007
02:44:21.731 --> 02:44:24.820
<v Speaker 2>we're going to the hospital now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so bad.</v>

4008
02:44:24.821 --> 02:44:26.890
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that you're so stoic that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you will,</v>

4009
02:44:26.891 --> 02:44:27.724
<v Speaker 2>you never complained once while you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gigantic pus filled sack on your </v>

4010
02:44:31.991 --> 02:44:33.790
<v Speaker 2>knee killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was horrible,</v>

4011
02:44:33.791 --> 02:44:34.624
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One posted the juke lamb video and they </v>

4012
02:44:36.341 --> 02:44:37.174
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

4013
02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:38.350
<v Speaker 2>do you know that there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

4014
02:44:38.380 --> 02:44:40.510
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bogging you,</v>

4015
02:44:40.520 --> 02:44:41.353
<v Speaker 2>not me.</v>

4016
02:44:44.620 --> 02:44:45.453
<v Speaker 2>So when you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were telling me that you were </v>

4017
02:44:47.351 --> 02:44:50.480
<v Speaker 2>doing bad and it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't feeling good and you were,</v>

4018
02:44:50.530 --> 02:44:53.020
<v Speaker 2>you were telling me you were suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4019
02:44:53.021 --> 02:44:53.980
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

4020
02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:57.490
<v Speaker 2>We got to now this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to figure this out.</v>

4021
02:44:57.760 --> 02:44:59.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do.</v>

4022
02:44:59.620 --> 02:45:03.910
<v Speaker 2>We're going to figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe nervous cause I was nervous that I</v>

4023
02:45:03.911 --> 02:45:08.620
<v Speaker 2>wasn't going to be there when you needed</v>
<v Speaker 2>me to be the hair and you know,</v>

4024
02:45:08.830 --> 02:45:09.730
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just,</v>

4025
02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:12.670
<v Speaker 2>I would just get the call just to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>the call.</v>

4026
02:45:12.990 --> 02:45:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean as a friend,</v>

4027
02:45:14.591 --> 02:45:15.424
<v Speaker 2>that's the last thing you want to do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>have some situation when you feel like </v>

4028
02:45:17.471 --> 02:45:18.304
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could have called them and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have made them feel better and </v>

4029
02:45:21.461 --> 02:45:24.100
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would've just gotten over that hump</v>

4030
02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:25.420
<v Speaker 2>and then they would have been okay.</v>

4031
02:45:25.420 --> 02:45:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Like you became okay man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you were my most depressed friend</v>

4032
02:45:30.430 --> 02:45:32.350
<v Speaker 2>and now you're probably one of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiest friends.</v>

4033
02:45:32.410 --> 02:45:33.243
<v Speaker 2>Even after I started seeing that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still took months before finding </v>

4034
02:45:37.181 --> 02:45:38.014
<v Speaker 2>the right pill and then the right dosage</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he would talk to me every like </v>

4035
02:45:40.331 --> 02:45:42.850
<v Speaker 2>30 days or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4036
02:45:42.851 --> 02:45:43.684
<v Speaker 2>I remember you describing the process </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that was </v>

4037
02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:48.010
<v Speaker 2>disconcerting to me was how random it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed to be.</v>

4038
02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:49.033
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which pills they chose and then it's </v>

4039
02:45:50.771 --> 02:45:53.410
<v Speaker 2>like they're guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what seemed insane to me.</v>

4040
02:45:53.411 --> 02:45:55.160
<v Speaker 2>I felt like if you like say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4041
02:45:55.161 --> 02:45:58.180
<v Speaker 2>then you got an infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know which antibiotic works best on</v>

4042
02:45:58.181 --> 02:45:59.020
<v Speaker 2>that infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

4043
02:45:59.050 --> 02:46:02.410
<v Speaker 2>they give it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this one wasn't that cut and dry.</v>

4044
02:46:02.411 --> 02:46:04.390
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just trying stuff out on you.</v>

4045
02:46:04.450 --> 02:46:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4046
02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:05.860
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need Ibuprofen,</v>

4047
02:46:05.861 --> 02:46:07.510
<v Speaker 2>you have an inflamed thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll took it down.</v>

4048
02:46:07.570 --> 02:46:09.230
<v Speaker 2>But they know generally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4049
02:46:09.231 --> 02:46:10.064
<v Speaker 2>This is like there's,</v>

4050
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:11.023
<v Speaker 1>from what I get gather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two things could be wrong with </v>

4051
02:46:14.061 --> 02:46:16.790
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You either have too much dopamine,</v>

4052
02:46:16.791 --> 02:46:17.624
<v Speaker 1>too little dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much something else or too little </v>

4053
02:46:20.331 --> 02:46:21.640
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

4054
02:46:21.710 --> 02:46:22.543
<v Speaker 1>And so each of these pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're into two categories or </v>

4055
02:46:25.101 --> 02:46:27.320
<v Speaker 1>four categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they either,</v>

4056
02:46:28.010 --> 02:46:30.260
<v Speaker 1>they either affect the dopamine or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect the other thing,</v>

4057
02:46:30.770 --> 02:46:33.980
<v Speaker 1>either limited or push more in and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

4058
02:46:34.010 --> 02:46:36.440
<v Speaker 1>so they don't know which one's doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to first.</v>

4059
02:46:37.150 --> 02:46:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then once they narrow that down,</v>

4060
02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:41.780
<v Speaker 1>they've got to decide if it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting too much of it or too little.</v>

4061
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:44.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're bipolars are </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate thing,</v>

4062
02:46:44.900 --> 02:46:48.170
<v Speaker 1>they're just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then while you take this shit,</v>

4063
02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:53.200
<v Speaker 1>you've added the horrible feelings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then added some awful side effect and it</v>

4064
02:46:54.270 --> 02:46:55.490
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

4065
02:46:57.020 --> 02:46:57.853
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things that I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to point out when when Bruce </v>

4066
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Roseanne was going to come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to really talk about medication</v>

4067
02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:07.730
<v Speaker 1>and how we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're asking this really,</v>

4068
02:47:08.650 --> 02:47:09.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's an elderly woman who's taking an </v>

4069
02:47:11.781 --> 02:47:13.160
<v Speaker 1>incredible amount of medication.</v>

4070
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:16.970
<v Speaker 1>She's taking a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She takes ambien every night.</v>

4071
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:18.343
<v Speaker 1>She's drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's smoking pot and she's on a host </v>

4072
02:47:20.721 --> 02:47:21.554
<v Speaker 1>and meds and these things are all doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle in her head and she barely knows </v>

4073
02:47:27.261 --> 02:47:29.450
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck she's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the time she's saying it.</v>

4074
02:47:29.451 --> 02:47:33.410
<v Speaker 1>She's in an ambient Hayes's in and out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it and she's open about it.</v>

4075
02:47:33.710 --> 02:47:34.431
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

4076
02:47:34.431 --> 02:47:39.431
<v Speaker 1>I need to get them to adjust my meds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everybody's is attacking her.</v>

4077
02:47:39.471 --> 02:47:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Like she can never recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's feel righteous.</v>

4078
02:47:42.111 --> 02:47:46.430
<v Speaker 1>But it's weird because I was such at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forefront of putting on like homosexuals</v>

4079
02:47:46.431 --> 02:47:48.410
<v Speaker 1>into mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4080
02:47:48.470 --> 02:47:50.630
<v Speaker 1>she didn't give a shit and suddenly it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4081
02:47:50.631 --> 02:47:51.464
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all gone.</v>

4082
02:47:51.770 --> 02:47:54.300
<v Speaker 1>You from a joke and people like she </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't joking.</v>

4083
02:47:54.301 --> 02:47:55.134
<v Speaker 1>I'm like for sure she was joking whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not you think she should have used </v>

4084
02:47:57.141 --> 02:47:57.710
<v Speaker 1>those words.</v>

4085
02:47:57.710 --> 02:47:59.690
<v Speaker 1>And by the way that that lady does look </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Jewish.</v>

4086
02:47:59.691 --> 02:48:03.200
<v Speaker 1>His shit that she was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like to say it's not a joke.</v>

4087
02:48:03.230 --> 02:48:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Let me just explain to everybody as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional comedian,</v>

4088
02:48:06.321 --> 02:48:10.580
<v Speaker 1>as an expert in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone says this person looks like</v>

4089
02:48:10.581 --> 02:48:13.630
<v Speaker 1>a mixture of this and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that his joke form,</v>

4090
02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:15.890
<v Speaker 1>that's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pure joke.</v>

4091
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:18.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that over and over again.</v>

4092
02:48:18.350 --> 02:48:20.720
<v Speaker 1>You see this person looks like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed with this.</v>

4093
02:48:20.930 --> 02:48:23.510
<v Speaker 1>This guy has a work ethic of this works </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

4094
02:48:23.511 --> 02:48:25.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's a joke for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's clearly a joke.</v>

4095
02:48:25.910 --> 02:48:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To say it's rice,</v>

4096
02:48:27.361 --> 02:48:27.981
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

4097
02:48:27.981 --> 02:48:30.050
<v Speaker 1>But the sign is not a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're being ridiculous.</v>

4098
02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously a joke.</v>

4099
02:48:33.170 --> 02:48:34.700
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that joke.</v>

4100
02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:35.750
<v Speaker 1>That's what we were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4101
02:48:35.980 --> 02:48:37.610
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a joke cause you can't say that</v>

4102
02:48:37.611 --> 02:48:38.060
<v Speaker 1>choke.</v>

4103
02:48:38.060 --> 02:48:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely joke.</v>

4104
02:48:39.430 --> 02:48:41.690
<v Speaker 1>But if she was black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd be able to tell a joke easy.</v>

4105

<v Speaker 1>those are going to get you on something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't.</v>

4117
02:49:16.700 --> 02:49:19.710
<v Speaker 1>We have an operator got a hundred people</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on that set.</v>

4118
02:49:19.770 --> 02:49:20.603
<v Speaker 1>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them actually they're going to </v>

4119
02:49:21.621 --> 02:49:22.454
<v Speaker 1>switch over to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to call it some new show </v>

4120
02:49:23.671 --> 02:49:23.890
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

4121
02:49:23.890 --> 02:49:24.631
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The con isn't,</v>

4122
02:49:24.631 --> 02:49:25.530
<v Speaker 1>but by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

4123
02:49:26.220 --> 02:49:27.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they should have fired </v>

4124
02:49:27.541 --> 02:49:28.470
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

4125
02:49:28.471 --> 02:49:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to let her apologize.</v>

4126
02:49:30.691 --> 02:49:33.690
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she explains herself and you realize who</v>

4127
02:49:33.691 --> 02:49:38.220
<v Speaker 1>she is and she's not terrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not so easy to put somebody as one</v>

4128
02:49:38.221 --> 02:49:39.054
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something I read a biography of </v>

4129
02:49:41.371 --> 02:49:44.670
<v Speaker 1>her conversations on songs to key,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4130
02:49:44.730 --> 02:49:47.520
<v Speaker 1>me and mark leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like house arrest for 20 years.</v>

4131
02:49:47.580 --> 02:49:50.670
<v Speaker 1>She was a Nobel peace prize prize for </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

4132
02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:52.073
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was talking about the Burmese </v>

4133
02:49:54.331 --> 02:49:56.590
<v Speaker 1>army who was torture her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

4134
02:49:56.591 --> 02:49:57.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4135
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:58.583
<v Speaker 1>killed and arrested forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of her colleagues and there was </v>

4136
02:50:01.921 --> 02:50:03.240
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4137
02:50:03.270 --> 02:50:08.270
<v Speaker 1>they're not all bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't make someone into one of their</v>

4138
02:50:08.431 --> 02:50:09.980
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just goes,</v>

4139
02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:11.033
<v Speaker 1>even if you've committed murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the worst things you can do that </v>

4140
02:50:14.521 --> 02:50:15.960
<v Speaker 1>is not who you are.</v>

4141
02:50:16.140 --> 02:50:17.880
<v Speaker 1>You're just someone who has committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>

4142
02:50:18.090 --> 02:50:19.410
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now there's a certain point,</v>

4143
02:50:19.530 --> 02:50:23.250
<v Speaker 1>we've done so much murder that you now </v>
<v Speaker 1>are really wholly a murderer.</v>

4144
02:50:23.410 --> 02:50:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's very rare.</v>

4145
02:50:24.940 --> 02:50:27.120
<v Speaker 1>What's much more common if someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>has killed somebody,</v>

4146
02:50:27.180 --> 02:50:29.640
<v Speaker 1>they're now no longer that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years later,</v>

4147
02:50:29.641 --> 02:50:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I have someone who kills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4148
02:50:31.561 --> 02:50:33.750
<v Speaker 1>and if to make somebody to one of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions is,</v>

4149
02:50:34.140 --> 02:50:36.180
<v Speaker 1>it's dehumanizing to all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

4150
02:50:36.181 --> 02:50:39.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's targets where people see someone</v>

4151
02:50:39.961 --> 02:50:40.794
<v Speaker 1>who leg is a Roseann who's like some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of cultural icon and they like to </v>

4152
02:50:45.151 --> 02:50:49.920
<v Speaker 1>shift it on them and attack them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like to go after them when some,</v>

4153
02:50:49.921 --> 02:50:53.610
<v Speaker 1>there's been some transgression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd done something which she did do.</v>

4154
02:50:53.670 --> 02:50:55.500
<v Speaker 1>If you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it upsets people.</v>

4155
02:50:55.590 --> 02:51:00.590
<v Speaker 1>So they want to attack in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh a go really unbalanced way.</v>

4156
02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:03.540
<v Speaker 1>They want to end it all for her.</v>

4157
02:51:03.900 --> 02:51:05.580
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4158
02:51:05.581 --> 02:51:06.720
<v Speaker 1>bounce back from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4159
02:51:06.721 --> 02:51:07.554
<v Speaker 1>They don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted pile on and want to kick </v>

4160
02:51:09.031 --> 02:51:11.130
<v Speaker 1>people whether down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause now it's my chance to kick you.</v>

4161
02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:13.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible lack of compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That comes from two things.</v>

4162
02:51:13.771 --> 02:51:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I think one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes from a jealousy.</v>

4163
02:51:16.200 --> 02:51:19.740
<v Speaker 1>There's a natural jealousy that we all </v>
<v Speaker 1>have four super successful people.</v>

4164
02:51:19.741 --> 02:51:20.530
<v Speaker 1>When they fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

4165
02:51:20.530 --> 02:51:22.080
<v Speaker 1>ha ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it.</v>

4166
02:51:22.110 --> 02:51:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it.</v>

4167
02:51:23.191 --> 02:51:25.350
<v Speaker 1>And now I have justification to attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

4168
02:51:26.310 --> 02:51:29.100
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a little bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's also,</v>

4169
02:51:30.450 --> 02:51:35.450
<v Speaker 1>when people feel like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want other people to feel like shit</v>

4170
02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:36.953
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4171
02:51:37.500 --> 02:51:38.333
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is what I think these </v>

4172
02:51:40.231 --> 02:51:42.090
<v Speaker 1>attacks on people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these rabbit attacks,</v>

4173
02:51:42.091 --> 02:51:44.010
<v Speaker 1>it's not coming from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not coming from me.</v>

4174
02:51:44.011 --> 02:51:45.900
<v Speaker 1>We're not screaming for the death of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Roseanne.</v>

4175
02:51:45.930 --> 02:51:49.470
<v Speaker 1>And even the people that are really the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the people just go,</v>

4176
02:51:49.530 --> 02:51:52.050
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking bullshit what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the network,</v>

4177
02:51:52.051 --> 02:51:53.550
<v Speaker 1>here's all these people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit.</v>

4178
02:51:53.580 --> 02:51:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4179
02:51:55.230 --> 02:51:56.063
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's symptom of where human beings are </v>

4180
02:51:59.581 --> 02:52:00.414
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's so many human beings </v>

4181
02:52:01.711 --> 02:52:04.470
<v Speaker 1>that are hurting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so when something comes up and gives</v>

4182
02:52:04.471 --> 02:52:06.040
<v Speaker 1>them a legitimate to be upset,</v>

4183
02:52:06.370 --> 02:52:07.203
<v Speaker 2>they just attack it full force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what disturbs me is the lack of an </v>

4184
02:52:11.770 --> 02:52:12.603
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming voice for compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lack of an overwhelming voice of </v>

4185
02:52:16.841 --> 02:52:17.800
<v Speaker 2>people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4186
02:52:17.890 --> 02:52:18.730
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

4187
02:52:18.731 --> 02:52:19.564
<v Speaker 2>real racism is awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this lady who probably did commit </v>

4188
02:52:23.591 --> 02:52:26.290
<v Speaker 2>real racism by calling the cops and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight year old girl,</v>

4189
02:52:26.620 --> 02:52:30.550
<v Speaker 2>she's just a fucked up person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does this all better?</v>

4190
02:52:30.551 --> 02:52:31.600
<v Speaker 2>To just forgive her.</v>

4191
02:52:31.870 --> 02:52:33.720
<v Speaker 3>What happened to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>

4192
02:52:33.721 --> 02:52:36.990
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some mistakes that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left and the right makes when trying to,</v>

4193
02:52:36.991 --> 02:52:38.860
<v Speaker 3>like when there's an e mob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4194
02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:41.650
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they seek to punish over,</v>

4195
02:52:41.651 --> 02:52:43.360
<v Speaker 3>educate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not looking for,</v>

4196
02:52:43.361 --> 02:52:44.950
<v Speaker 3>to make the person changes their </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>

4197
02:52:45.250 --> 02:52:46.150
<v Speaker 3>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're ignorant.</v>

4198
02:52:46.151 --> 02:52:46.984
<v Speaker 3>And then they leave it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So probably the thing I got the most </v>

4199
02:52:49.631 --> 02:52:52.480
<v Speaker 3>flack for in my life was the amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist videos.</v>

4200
02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:54.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gee,</v>

4201
02:52:54.510 --> 02:52:55.560
<v Speaker 3>I wonder why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4202
02:52:55.590 --> 02:52:57.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting new people find it and say,</v>

4203
02:52:57.331 --> 02:52:58.320
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're racist.</v>

4204
02:52:58.530 --> 02:53:02.370
<v Speaker 3>I have maybe gotten three texts message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4205
02:53:02.371 --> 02:53:04.350
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten hundreds and hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>death threats.</v>

4206
02:53:04.730 --> 02:53:08.000
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten thousands and thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>angry fuck you's racist.</v>

4207
02:53:08.001 --> 02:53:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Racista I'm whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe only three total.</v>

4208
02:53:11.521 --> 02:53:13.760
<v Speaker 3>And I can really think of too of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

4209
02:53:13.761 --> 02:53:14.750
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just so you know,</v>

4210
02:53:14.780 --> 02:53:17.930
<v Speaker 3>this is why that hurts me because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>an immigrant here.</v>

4211
02:53:17.931 --> 02:53:20.710
<v Speaker 3>And then when I see stuff like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it reinforces the feeling that I'm like,</v>

4212
02:53:21.170 --> 02:53:22.003
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of the thousands and thousands of the </v>

4213
02:53:24.201 --> 02:53:25.034
<v Speaker 3>other way of fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're not really trying to educate </v>

4214
02:53:27.561 --> 02:53:30.830
<v Speaker 3>and you want to change their opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really just trying to like lash out.</v>

4215
02:53:30.860 --> 02:53:31.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what is that?</v>

4216
02:53:31.791 --> 02:53:32.690
<v Speaker 3>Why are we all like that?</v>

4217
02:53:33.020 --> 02:53:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Because we're unhappy and you find a </v>
<v Speaker 2>target and you got a free shot.</v>

4218
02:53:36.670 --> 02:53:38.890
<v Speaker 2>You ever see a guy go down in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ghetto?</v>

4219
02:53:39.610 --> 02:53:40.443
<v Speaker 2>You ever see a fight where a guy goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the ghetto and everybody runs in </v>

4220
02:53:42.071 --> 02:53:43.960
<v Speaker 2>and kicks him in the head?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see any of those?</v>

4221
02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:47.290
<v Speaker 2>There's a gang of those on a street </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight videos.</v>

4222
02:53:47.350 --> 02:53:51.160
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of street five videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of the craziest ones are in bad</v>

4223
02:53:51.161 --> 02:53:53.900
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods where someone gets knocked</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and then where else?</v>

4224
02:53:54.030 --> 02:53:54.863
<v Speaker 2>Bunch of people take free shots on him </v>
<v Speaker 2>while he's down and out to get a free </v>

4225
02:53:57.221 --> 02:53:58.054
<v Speaker 2>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of videos like that and </v>

4226
02:53:59.141 --> 02:54:02.000
<v Speaker 2>there as a person who understands brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>trauma,</v>

4227
02:54:02.120 --> 02:54:02.953
<v Speaker 2>it's severely disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I've talked to so many of these </v>

4228
02:54:05.601 --> 02:54:06.434
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientists about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all these blunt force impacts on </v>

4229
02:54:08.631 --> 02:54:09.464
<v Speaker 2>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing the guy was totally </v>

4230
02:54:10.101 --> 02:54:10.934
<v Speaker 2>unconscious and they want walk by and </v>
<v Speaker 2>soccer kick him in the head while he's </v>

4231
02:54:14.031 --> 02:54:14.864
<v Speaker 2>totally unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just take turns hitting him full blast </v>

4232
02:54:17.361 --> 02:54:19.220
<v Speaker 2>in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a bunch of people do it.</v>

4233
02:54:19.221 --> 02:54:20.870
<v Speaker 2>They stop him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kick him.</v>

4234
02:54:21.080 --> 02:54:24.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's out cold with his pants down</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are kicking him in the head.</v>

4235
02:54:25.500 --> 02:54:26.333
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people [inaudible] the </v>
<v Speaker 3>effects that one of those he rages can </v>

4236
02:54:31.921 --> 02:54:34.710
<v Speaker 3>have on your psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think when people,</v>

4237
02:54:34.770 --> 02:54:38.580
<v Speaker 3>they see something like the lion guy or </v>
<v Speaker 3>that dude who fucking caught a foul ball</v>

4238
02:54:38.581 --> 02:54:42.810
<v Speaker 3>and the cubs game or fuck head metzger </v>
<v Speaker 3>or anything like that.</v>

4239
02:54:42.870 --> 02:54:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Or they say this lady with the short </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl,</v>

4240
02:54:45.030 --> 02:54:46.830
<v Speaker 3>it comes at you from everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

4241
02:54:47.040 --> 02:54:50.430
<v Speaker 3>And then pick the site like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the zeitgeists moves on,</v>

4242
02:54:50.431 --> 02:54:51.264
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people kind of move on and think </v>

4243
02:54:51.551 --> 02:54:52.384
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still getting hundreds of stuff </v>

4244
02:54:53.551 --> 02:54:55.510
<v Speaker 3>a day saying fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>

4245

<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4246

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4247
02:54:57.610 --> 02:55:00.570
<v Speaker 3>And so you all move on like nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

4248
02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:03.870
<v Speaker 3>but everyone who's shit on them a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit has added to their this,</v>

4249
02:55:03.871 --> 02:55:04.190
<v Speaker 3>this</v>

4250
02:55:04.190 --> 02:55:06.680
<v Speaker 5>overwhelming like this thing you can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>get out.</v>

4251
02:55:06.681 --> 02:55:09.380
<v Speaker 5>I still think Mexico's flailing off that</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit off.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

4255
02:55:18.180 --> 02:55:20.660
<v Speaker 5>So all the people adding like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey fuck you for killing that lion.</v>

<v Speaker 5>in psychology.</v>

4257
02:55:25.370 --> 02:55:27.830
<v Speaker 5>It's not an easy thing to get over and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't see it all,</v>

4258
02:55:27.831 --> 02:55:31.210

<v Speaker 5>you need to give this to someone else </v>

4262
02:55:39.561 --> 02:55:41.570

02:55:53.841 --> 02:55:54.674
<v Speaker 5>people telling you that it doesn't do </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything for you when you've already </v>

<v Speaker 5>bar fight kicking somebody down.</v>

<v Speaker 3>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the parents were there and like,</v>

4315
02:57:23.801 --> 02:57:24.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the look.</v>

4317
02:57:25.521 --> 02:57:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we taught them how to do that.</v>

4318
02:57:27.290 --> 02:57:28.190
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

4319
02:57:28.860 --> 02:57:29.693
<v Speaker 3>We taught them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've walked with them from the park </v>

4320
02:57:30.851 --> 02:57:31.684
<v Speaker 3>enough times and we taught our kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to where we trust that they can </v>

4321
02:57:33.931 --> 02:57:34.920
<v Speaker 3>come home for the PUK alone.</v>

4322
02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:37.920
<v Speaker 5>We've taught them how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We trust them with it.</v>

4323
02:57:38.790 --> 02:57:39.541
<v Speaker 3>And then people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4324
02:57:39.541 --> 02:57:41.550
<v Speaker 3>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was a split in the story.</v>

4325
02:57:41.670 --> 02:57:42.503
<v Speaker 3>Most people read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>90% of the people who read it called </v>

4326
02:57:43.881 --> 02:57:44.714
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents should be allowed to trust when </v>

4327
02:57:46.381 --> 02:57:49.260
<v Speaker 3>their kids are trained enough to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like driving at 16.</v>

4328
02:57:49.261 --> 02:57:51.160
<v Speaker 3>That's a parent's decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4329
02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10% of the people were like,</v>

4330
02:57:53.761 --> 02:57:55.350
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do that with my kids.</v>

4331
02:57:55.351 --> 02:57:56.184
<v Speaker 3>That's fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those people reached out on twitter </v>

4332

<v Speaker 5>What were we just saying?</v>

4382
02:59:40.391 --> 02:59:42.090
<v Speaker 5>Side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does have its side effects.</v>

4383
02:59:42.150 --> 02:59:42.983
<v Speaker 5>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no doubting that you were </v>

4384
02:59:44.731 --> 02:59:46.890
<v Speaker 5>talking about he rage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4385
02:59:46.891 --> 02:59:49.830
<v Speaker 5>Medsker z rage is pretty rough people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He hasn't gotten out of that yet.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People to fucking man.</v>

4387
02:59:53.630 --> 02:59:54.463
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like we're stalled out in </v>

4388
02:59:58.381 --> 03:00:02.040
<v Speaker 5>our cultural evolution in a way that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>feel like we're,</v>

4389
03:00:02.041 --> 03:00:06.240
<v Speaker 5>we're in these movements of change and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>think I see a lot of positive things,</v>

4390
03:00:06.510 --> 03:00:10.050
<v Speaker 5>but I don't see nearly enough like </v>
<v Speaker 5>friendliness and compassion.</v>

4391
03:00:10.051 --> 03:00:13.500
<v Speaker 5>I think we really need more of that as </v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings.</v>

4392
03:00:13.680 --> 03:00:15.090
<v Speaker 5>This is not lasting.</v>

4393
03:00:15.360 --> 03:00:17.370
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to last.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's lasting.</v>

4394
03:00:17.880 --> 03:00:19.530
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to die.</v>

4395
03:00:19.560 --> 03:00:22.260
<v Speaker 5>We're all going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're here for a certain amount of time.</v>

4396
03:00:22.261 --> 03:00:24.540
<v Speaker 5>It's not permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And while you're here,</v>

4397
03:00:24.750 --> 03:00:26.460
<v Speaker 5>we can make everything better for </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>

4398
03:00:26.550 --> 03:00:29.310
<v Speaker 5>Just being nicer to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can be done.</v>

4399
03:00:29.610 --> 03:00:31.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to be done.</v>

4400
03:00:31.321 --> 03:00:33.600
<v Speaker 5>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he can be done a little drifty.</v>

4401
03:00:33.601 --> 03:00:35.280
<v Speaker 5>I think what you do has got affect your </v>
<v Speaker 5>own life.</v>

4402
03:00:35.281 --> 03:00:36.114
<v Speaker 5>Say I can't change it for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what I can do is every time every </v>

4403
03:00:39.061 --> 03:00:40.560
<v Speaker 5>one of these blogs make them angry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just go.</v>

4404
03:00:40.980 --> 03:00:41.813
<v Speaker 5>I probably don't have the whole story on</v>
<v Speaker 5>this cause that's happened 20 times </v>

4405
03:00:44.431 --> 03:00:44.941
<v Speaker 5>already.</v>

<v Speaker 5>What I'm going to do is go outside and </v>

4416
03:01:07.570 --> 03:01:11.590

<v Speaker 1>forum for debating ideas,</v>

4422

<v Speaker 1>necessary mentality and they think that </v>

4441
03:02:16.621 --> 03:02:17.454

<v Speaker 1>lately more,</v>

4446
03:02:32.560 --> 03:02:34.030
<v Speaker 1>more often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the ACL,</v>

4447
03:02:34.031 --> 03:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>you change his stance on free speech and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

4448
03:02:37.201 --> 03:02:39.610
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're deeming free speech is something</v>

4449
03:02:39.611 --> 03:02:41.860
<v Speaker 1>that's not hurtful to someone else.</v>

4450
03:02:42.220 --> 03:02:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what free speech is.</v>

4451
03:02:43.601 --> 03:02:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the most recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most recent reading about free speech?</v>

4452
03:02:48.010 --> 03:02:51.040
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the Eclu stance </v>
<v Speaker 1>on free speech,</v>

4453
03:02:51.060 --> 03:02:51.893
<v Speaker 1>but you can't in French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my belief is you can't fringe on their </v>

4454
03:02:54.110 --> 03:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>such fine as long as you don't fringe on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rights of someone else.</v>

4455
03:02:56.410 --> 03:02:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like you can burn a flag if you want,</v>

4456
03:02:58.451 --> 03:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>but you can't burn a flag in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>

4457
03:03:00.730 --> 03:03:01.563
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're shifting concern right </v>

4458
03:03:03.820 --> 03:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>through to what harm is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a gorgeous looking at physical harm</v>

4459
03:03:06.461 --> 03:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>or monetary and physical or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talk about like slight mental harm.</v>

4460
03:03:10.150 --> 03:03:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's racism,</v>

4461
03:03:11.531 --> 03:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>it's clearly emotional harm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental harm.</v>

4462
03:03:14.430 --> 03:03:15.263
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're damaging someone's psyche if </v>

4463
03:03:16.600 --> 03:03:17.433
<v Speaker 1>you're dismissing them in a racist way </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're insulting them in a racist </v>

4464
03:03:20.831 --> 03:03:21.664
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things not </v>

4465
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:24.010
<v Speaker 1>wanting to white people.</v>

4466
03:03:24.640 --> 03:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem with sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4467
03:03:25.871 --> 03:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>So I heard this theory that like making </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun of white people and dismissing Ypo.</v>

4468
03:03:30.770 --> 03:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you white guy.</v>

4469
03:03:31.841 --> 03:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

4470
03:03:32.831 --> 03:03:33.664
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've just put me into a category that </v>

4471
03:03:34.801 --> 03:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just race,</v>

4472
03:03:35.470 --> 03:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4473
03:03:36.371 --> 03:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't like when people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that til he was.</v>

4474
03:03:37.931 --> 03:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know why you're using those </v>
<v Speaker 1>methods now.</v>

4475
03:03:39.880 --> 03:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Does it make sense to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4476
03:03:40.991 --> 03:03:43.190
<v Speaker 1>it's the tide coming in and out right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

4477
03:03:43.210 --> 03:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>The whites owned slaves for so long and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so fucking oppressive that now as</v>

4478
03:03:47.771 --> 03:03:48.604
<v Speaker 1>it's shifted back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still economic despair and all </v>

4479
03:03:50.681 --> 03:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>black neighborhoods because of racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>laws and things have bounced out yet.</v>

4480
03:03:53.980 --> 03:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>So you're allowed to go fuck white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

4481
03:03:56.380 --> 03:03:58.070
<v Speaker 1>So you're allowed to fuck white people </v>
<v Speaker 1>until</v>

4482
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.903
<v Speaker 3>it goes this way and this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he got to the point where you </v>

4483
03:04:00.741 --> 03:04:02.270
<v Speaker 3>shitting on Christians and I'm not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian.</v>

<v Speaker 2>documentaries of a different priests </v>

<v Speaker 2>That's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they got away with it</v>

4522
03:05:17.670 --> 03:05:19.560
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the Aclu remains fully committed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>defending free speech as a document.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She cites expressly with firms </v>
<v Speaker 2>expressing reforms.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You've got to say all of it.</v>

4573
03:07:08.550 --> 03:07:10.680
<v Speaker 1>You can even roll your eyes and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's an idiot.</v>

4574
03:07:10.770 --> 03:07:13.830
<v Speaker 1>That's your right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't stop them from talking because</v>

4575
03:07:13.831 --> 03:07:14.664
<v Speaker 1>then it keeps going to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>rap is getting fucking boycotted in </v>

4576
03:07:19.441 --> 03:07:21.510
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't put your shit out.</v>

4577
03:07:21.900 --> 03:07:22.733
<v Speaker 1>It goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will always go to a point where it'd </v>

4578
03:07:24.541 --> 03:07:26.850
<v Speaker 1>be super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super repressive.</v>

4579
03:07:27.810 --> 03:07:28.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if one person who is not doing anything </v>

4580
03:07:30.721 --> 03:07:32.730
<v Speaker 1>wrong can't speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done something wrong.</v>

4581
03:07:33.150 --> 03:07:33.983
<v Speaker 1>You could easily compromise a group two </v>
<v Speaker 1>and turn it into a terrorist </v>

4582
03:07:36.900 --> 03:07:37.733
<v Speaker 1>organization by infiltrating it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having someone caused violence and it </v>

4583
03:07:40.810 --> 03:07:42.210
<v Speaker 1>did occupy Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what?</v>

4584
03:07:42.220 --> 03:07:43.053
<v Speaker 1>Sending some undercover cops start fist </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights and then they get brought that I </v>

4585
03:07:45.091 --> 03:07:46.680
<v Speaker 1>could go home this fist fights now.</v>

4586
03:07:46.960 --> 03:07:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids that were hanging around in occupy,</v>

4587
03:07:49.321 --> 03:07:50.154
<v Speaker 1>we're saying that they would run into </v>
<v Speaker 1>undercover agents and undercover cops </v>

4588
03:07:53.130 --> 03:07:54.240
<v Speaker 1>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but would,</v>

4589
03:07:54.241 --> 03:07:56.730
<v Speaker 1>the guys they knew were undercover and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

4590
03:07:56.731 --> 03:07:57.564
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're just like being overwhelmed </v>

4591
03:08:00.061 --> 03:08:04.080
<v Speaker 1>by people who are lying to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the government to keep the peace</v>

4592
03:08:04.081 --> 03:08:04.914
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like secret covert agents </v>

4593
03:08:06.001 --> 03:08:07.950
<v Speaker 1>hanging around with these occupied kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4594
03:08:08.200 --> 03:08:09.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever see,</v>

4595
03:08:10.080 --> 03:08:12.150
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorites is when Peter </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schiff,</v>

4596
03:08:12.390 --> 03:08:15.540
<v Speaker 1>who the venture capitalists banker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Genius Guy.</v>

4597
03:08:15.541 --> 03:08:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen Peter Schiff been on </v>
<v Speaker 1>my podcast a few times,</v>

4598
03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:21.090
<v Speaker 1>super wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful business guy.</v>

4599
03:08:21.360 --> 03:08:22.193
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went down to occupy Wall Street and </v>

4600
03:08:24.481 --> 03:08:25.314
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4601
03:08:25.470 --> 03:08:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he sat up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a multimillionaire.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4603

4604
03:08:31.800 --> 03:08:35.430
<v Speaker 1>something along those ways are I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what his actual,</v>

4605
03:08:35.490 --> 03:08:36.020
<v Speaker 1>that's fun.</v>

03:08:36.020 --> 03:08:38.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a patrol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was a great troll?</v>

4607
03:08:38.221 --> 03:08:39.054
<v Speaker 1>Because he's a financial genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He understands the market inside and </v>

4608
03:08:41.101 --> 03:08:41.934
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what the fuck they're </v>

4609
03:08:42.421 --> 03:08:43.290
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

4610
03:08:43.291 --> 03:08:43.710
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>

4612
03:08:45.760 --> 03:08:47.910
<v Speaker 1>an enormous business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make tremendous amount of capital.</v>

4613
03:08:47.911 --> 03:08:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Why should you make the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money as me?</v>

4614
03:08:50.370 --> 03:08:51.203
<v Speaker 1>And she's fucking tortures these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he speaks a fucking hundred and </v>

4615
03:08:54.691 --> 03:08:55.524
<v Speaker 1>50 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they don't know what they're saying </v>

4616
03:08:56.851 --> 03:08:58.040
<v Speaker 1>and he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

4617
03:08:58.100 --> 03:08:58.933
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very comical to watch and it just </v>

4618
03:09:00.271 --> 03:09:01.104
<v Speaker 1>shows you how people go into these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things with these idealistic ideas of </v>

4619
03:09:05.011 --> 03:09:05.844
<v Speaker 1>what they think they're standing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they don't even have like a </v>

4620
03:09:07.741 --> 03:09:08.574
<v Speaker 1>framework of what they're against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The policies and the banking and the </v>

4621
03:09:11.911 --> 03:09:14.460
<v Speaker 1>corporations and capitalism in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a,</v>

4622
03:09:14.640 --> 03:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people that do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people don't.</v>

4623
03:09:17.430 --> 03:09:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Most people that are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there for the ride.</v>

4624
03:09:20.900 --> 03:09:21.733
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4657
03:10:38.561 --> 03:10:40.570
<v Speaker 1>joke about Alaska being a frozen Puerto </v>

4662
03:10:47.351 --> 03:10:48.430
<v Speaker 1>We keep helping them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4663
03:10:49.020 --> 03:10:53.110
<v Speaker 1>What do we look at it if it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>state cause before he goes,</v>

4664
03:10:53.111 --> 03:10:55.420
<v Speaker 1>not a stage four because they're Puerto </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rican is part of it.</v>

4665
03:10:56.470 --> 03:10:58.630
<v Speaker 1>They always want to do this too in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>backlash on things.</v>

4666
03:10:58.631 --> 03:10:59.464
<v Speaker 1>They want to narrow it down to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible thing and it's like it ain't </v>

4667
03:11:01.341 --> 03:11:02.174
<v Speaker 1>one possible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you have to give it up for all of </v>

4668
03:11:04.121 --> 03:11:04.720
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4670
03:11:05.771 --> 03:11:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it's because they're not white </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're Latino ish.</v>

4671
03:11:09.390 --> 03:11:10.223
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it's also mixed in with the ads </v>

4672
03:11:11.651 --> 03:11:12.484
<v Speaker 1>are not a full state wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew enough about finances to ask the </v>

4673
03:11:15.341 --> 03:11:18.010
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that the reason why these</v>

4674
03:11:18.011 --> 03:11:21.490
<v Speaker 1>corporations and these rich dudes wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>a movie wants to move there and,</v>

4675
03:11:21.880 --> 03:11:26.680
<v Speaker 1>and get such a low tax rate that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to pay is also why they didn't have</v>

4676
03:11:26.681 --> 03:11:30.190
<v Speaker 1>the money to recover from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure being down.</v>

4677
03:11:30.580 --> 03:11:33.310
<v Speaker 1>And so that these two might somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another be correlated,</v>

4678
03:11:33.340 --> 03:11:34.173
<v Speaker 1>or is it just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the hurricane was so fucking </v>

4679
03:11:36.881 --> 03:11:40.510
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly devastating that it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>took forever to fix?</v>

4680
03:11:41.380 --> 03:11:42.213
<v Speaker 1>Which one is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because anybody who thinks you don't </v>

4681
03:11:43.961 --> 03:11:44.794
<v Speaker 1>need government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to sit down and talk about how </v>

4682
03:11:47.351 --> 03:11:50.140
<v Speaker 1>we're going to fix things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to sit down and talk</v>

4683
03:11:50.141 --> 03:11:52.840
<v Speaker 1>about infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have some local government,</v>

4684
03:11:52.841 --> 03:11:53.950
<v Speaker 1>but you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

4685
03:11:53.951 --> 03:11:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are crazy.</v>

4686
03:11:56.050 --> 03:11:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Today in Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine months after Hurricane Maria,</v>

4688
03:12:01.961 --> 03:12:04.810
<v Speaker 1>customers still do not have power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many cases,</v>

4689
03:12:05.020 --> 03:12:09.460
<v Speaker 1>these homes were more than one or where </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than one person lives.</v>

4690
03:12:09.461 --> 03:12:12.190
<v Speaker 1>It may be another months before they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4691
03:12:12.550 --> 03:12:15.580
<v Speaker 1>We're going to tweet about this until </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last customer has power.</v>

4704
03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Nine months after the hurricane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hurricanes are coming again.</v>

4708
03:12:48.641 --> 03:12:50.320
<v Speaker 1>completely decimated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

4709
03:12:50.321 --> 03:12:53.360
<v Speaker 1>I think the whole island got wiped off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face of the map.</v>

4710
03:12:53.870 --> 03:12:56.120
<v Speaker 1>I think there's for the first time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 300 years.</v>

4711
03:12:56.121 --> 03:13:00.590
<v Speaker 1>No human beings live on an island too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

4712
03:13:01.160 --> 03:13:01.993
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck you imagine living in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place where the sky becomes an angry </v>

4713
03:13:05.811 --> 03:13:06.644
<v Speaker 1>monster and just rips houses apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should have seen some of these </v>

<v Speaker 1>get to cover now.</v>

4716

<v Speaker 1>minute,</v>

4717
03:13:18.260 --> 03:13:19.490

<v Speaker 1>Miami and we had a stop on the highway </v>

03:13:36.730 --> 03:13:38.510
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was so much rain.</v>

4790
03:16:22.261 --> 03:16:24.840
<v Speaker 2>what's the matter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said for some people,</v>

4791
03:16:24.841 --> 03:16:26.820
<v Speaker 2>if they have allergies to certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>allergies,</v>

4792
03:16:27.090 --> 03:16:29.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get this dog,</v>

4793
03:16:29.760 --> 03:16:34.050
<v Speaker 2>this weird fucking fog that comes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's mixed with volcanic,</v>

4794
03:16:34.051 --> 03:16:35.440
<v Speaker 2>volcanic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4795
03:16:35.820 --> 03:16:37.570
<v Speaker 2>either admissions or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4796
03:16:37.740 --> 03:16:40.350
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of stuff that these people were in</v>

4797
03:16:40.351 --> 03:16:42.420
<v Speaker 2>danger of is not just the volcano </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

4798
03:16:42.421 --> 03:16:43.650
<v Speaker 2>but the toxic gas.</v>

4799
03:16:43.680 --> 03:16:44.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so some of those gases that leak </v>

4800
03:16:46.261 --> 03:16:47.094
<v Speaker 2>from the volcano get in the fog and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are particularly susceptible to </v>

4801
03:16:49.861 --> 03:16:50.580
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4802
03:16:50.580 --> 03:16:52.530
<v Speaker 2>I remember that European one where </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was like,</v>

4803
03:16:52.531 --> 03:16:54.780
<v Speaker 2>all the crops are ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4804
03:16:54.810 --> 03:16:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Was that the Iceland one where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know,</v>

4805
03:16:56.720 --> 03:16:57.553
<v Speaker 2>that's the one that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the one that was responsible </v>

4806
03:17:00.361 --> 03:17:03.240
<v Speaker 2>for that Michael Hastings guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know Michael Hastings?</v>

4807
03:17:03.241 --> 03:17:05.370
<v Speaker 2>He's that journalist that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his career?</v>

4808
03:17:05.430 --> 03:17:05.911
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4809
03:17:05.911 --> 03:17:06.300
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4810
03:17:06.300 --> 03:17:07.133
<v Speaker 2>He was over there doing a story on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>general for rolling stone and they had </v>

4811
03:17:12.631 --> 03:17:15.510
<v Speaker 2>the volcano happen and he couldn't fly </v>
<v Speaker 2>home for a long time.</v>

4812
03:17:15.720 --> 03:17:18.390
<v Speaker 2>So he's over there embedded with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers for a long period of time.</v>

4813
03:17:18.391 --> 03:17:20.160
<v Speaker 2>And during that time they got a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>loose with them.</v>

4814
03:17:20.580 --> 03:17:22.890
<v Speaker 2>And started being themselves and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

4815
03:17:22.950 --> 03:17:25.680
<v Speaker 2>some general said some stupid shit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama,</v>

4816
03:17:25.681 --> 03:17:26.514
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insulted them in some way and they got </v>

4817
03:17:27.781 --> 03:17:29.800
<v Speaker 2>this and I still write general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4818
03:17:29.801 --> 03:17:31.890
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no US general because this guy was doing</v>

4819
03:17:31.891 --> 03:17:34.560
<v Speaker 2>a story overseas and as he was doing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story overseas,</v>

4820
03:17:34.680 --> 03:17:36.450
<v Speaker 2>he got stranded there because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>volcano.</v>

4821
03:17:37.380 --> 03:17:38.380
<v Speaker 2>So Michael Hastings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

4822
03:17:38.400 --> 03:17:43.400
<v Speaker 2>this very bad story about this general </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then comes back and you know,</v>

4823
03:17:43.801 --> 03:17:45.480
<v Speaker 2>the general gets fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4824
03:17:45.510 --> 03:17:48.000
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he loses his job and he's like a beloved</v>

4825
03:17:48.001 --> 03:17:48.834
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Michael Hastings then winds up </v>

4826
03:17:51.451 --> 03:17:56.451
<v Speaker 2>driving his fucking car into a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going 120 miles an hour on sunset.</v>

4827
03:17:56.970 --> 03:17:57.803
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fear was that someone had murked </v>

4828
03:18:00.661 --> 03:18:01.494
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they had done is they had hired </v>

4829
03:18:02.941 --> 03:18:03.774
<v Speaker 2>someone to take over his car because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got one of them modern Mercedes </v>

4830
03:18:07.981 --> 03:18:08.814
<v Speaker 2>where it just hack into an hack into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could force those things to drive </v>

4831
03:18:10.681 --> 03:18:11.720
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do,</v>

4832
03:18:11.910 --> 03:18:14.100
<v Speaker 2>you could literally get into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer and turn,</v>

4833
03:18:14.101 --> 03:18:14.934
<v Speaker 2>shift the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hastings found himself on a bus from </v>

4834
03:18:17.731 --> 03:18:19.860
<v Speaker 2>parents to Berlin with mcchrystal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his entourage.</v>

4835
03:18:19.861 --> 03:18:20.694
<v Speaker 2>The visit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was supposed to take place in two </v>

4836
03:18:21.541 --> 03:18:22.374
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned into a month during which time </v>

4837
03:18:23.821 --> 03:18:26.220
<v Speaker 2>hastings had considerable access to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

4838
03:18:26.490 --> 03:18:27.323
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big conspiracy theory was that he </v>

4839
03:18:30.840 --> 03:18:31.673
<v Speaker 2>was murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the big conspiracy because his </v>

4840
03:18:33.241 --> 03:18:36.360
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the engine flew from the car.</v>

4841
03:18:36.600 --> 03:18:38.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it exploded,</v>

4842
03:18:38.550 --> 03:18:40.230
<v Speaker 2>like to do some sort of explosion in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

4843
03:18:40.290 --> 03:18:44.910
<v Speaker 2>And then there was also the toxicology </v>
<v Speaker 2>examine toxicology examination,</v>

4844
03:18:45.090 --> 03:18:46.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure revealed we looking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4845
03:18:47.680 --> 03:18:50.950
<v Speaker 2>revealed that he was a on some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>amphetamine,</v>

4846
03:18:51.040 --> 03:18:53.470
<v Speaker 2>but all writers are on adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them,</v>

4847
03:18:53.500 --> 03:18:54.430
<v Speaker 2>but a shit load of them.</v>

4848
03:18:54.810 --> 03:18:55.643
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Lawrence that were in the Cabo </v>

4849
03:18:57.240 --> 03:18:58.110

<v Speaker 3>You're testing somebody for a weed.</v>

4864
03:19:29.870 --> 03:19:31.010
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be awful.</v>

4865
03:19:32.490 --> 03:19:33.323
<v Speaker 3>It's three 30 ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to bring this bad boy to a </v>

4866
03:19:34.981 --> 03:19:36.960
<v Speaker 3>close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to thank you all for tuning in.</v>

4867
03:19:37.080 --> 03:19:38.880
<v Speaker 3>Well let me say this already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great.com</v>

4868
03:19:39.060 --> 03:19:41.070
<v Speaker 3>go to [inaudible] dot com but I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this hour,</v>

4869
03:19:41.240 --> 03:19:42.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it Edinburgh.</v>

4870
03:19:42.270 --> 03:19:43.103
<v Speaker 3>That's Kinda what I geared at for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for last year and a half to fucking </v>

4871
03:19:45.661 --> 03:19:49.590
<v Speaker 3>unveiling and Edinburgh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've watched them for two times now.</v>

4872
03:19:49.591 --> 03:19:51.740
<v Speaker 3>I was out there and it's kind of got </v>
<v Speaker 3>influenced by someone that,</v>

4873
03:19:51.741 --> 03:19:54.000
<v Speaker 3>her style of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the only problem with this style</v>

4874
03:19:54.030 --> 03:19:54.863
<v Speaker 3>comedies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give up and we've talked about </v>

4875
03:19:56.031 --> 03:19:57.390
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They give up the jokes for the sake of a</v>

4876
03:19:57.391 --> 03:20:00.660
<v Speaker 3>point or theme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm very careful not to do that,</v>

4877
03:20:00.661 --> 03:20:03.390
<v Speaker 3>to make all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it work on its own and clubs in America.</v>
