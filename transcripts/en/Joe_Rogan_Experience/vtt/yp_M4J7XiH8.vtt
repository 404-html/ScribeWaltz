00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

2
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this whole fitness connection to</v>

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why do they need to be in shape?</v>

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in pretty good shape.</v>

5
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I went with Rinella and when I went with</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I realized that point,</v>

7
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I got pretty winded going up these</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hills,</v>

8
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiking,</v>

9
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:18.294
<v Speaker 1>tires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you out,</v>

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>especially high altitude and then I see</v>
<v Speaker 1>your videos online and I was like,</v>

11
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this guy into?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as I go deeper and deeper into</v>

12
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized,</v>

13
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like an extreme pursuit.</v>

14
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 1>This is not just something just go out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do.</v>

15
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>This is something that's really hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

16
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

17
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read this one article,</v>

18
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>but there's one guy who was unsuccessful</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 years in a row,</v>

19
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 1>elk hunting for it.</v>

20
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Finally shot an elk like 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how many times did this guy go out?</v>

21
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>How many days did he camped in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forest?</v>

22
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>How many days did he try to stock and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get winded or snap on a twig?</v>

23
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>At the last minute or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

24
00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>the elk season and bolts it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are unsuccessful.</v>

25
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean nine out of 10 every year.</v>

26
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Unsuccessful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more than that for elk</v>

27
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With archery it,</v>

28
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about 10 percent.</v>

29
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Is it 10 percent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>So nine out of 10 are unsuccessful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people who don't hunt who see dead</v>

31
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>stuff all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>

32
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.290
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just go out and kill an Adam,</v>

33
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:20.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

34
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most 90 percent don't.</v>

35
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>It is really hard and it's just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you're out there,</v>

36
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>you got the bone in your hand and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to close in on that animal and</v>

37
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do everything right</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a to z with.</v>

38
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.580
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many variables during</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole path is just like,</v>

39
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>it seems impossible sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>even even for me after 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense,</v>

41
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>psychologically when you talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists and their rejection of</v>

42
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>these classic male structures are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they doing is realizing that</v>

43
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to compete in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>classic as stated male hierarchy.</v>

44
00:01:57.631 --> 00:01:59.790
<v Speaker 1>So they're creating their own version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

45
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the creative element.</v>

46
00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we,</v>

47
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we asked earlier,</v>

48
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 1>what's the motivation of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological guys who are out there like</v>

49
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>bolstering up the feminists?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>they don't compete any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't compete.</v>

52
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>They figured out how to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They compete as allies.</v>

53
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] very sneaky.</v>

54
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's how everybody always</v>
<v Speaker 1>describes them to when you.</v>

56
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

57
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I avoid doing it because it just almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels gross to label them like that,</v>

58
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the way you think of male</v>

59
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think of them as sneaky</v>

60
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>and it's creepy and discriminated</v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminatory towards classic male</v>

61
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

62
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:47.250
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no wonder they haven't got a hope of</v>

63
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:50.400
<v Speaker 1>competing in that hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

64
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>that's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is deep.</v>

65
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be hurtful to a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

66
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people listening to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

67
00:02:58.681 --> 00:02:59.514
<v Speaker 1>very upset.</v>

68
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 2>You asked earlier why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the postmodernists don't like blunt</v>

69
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why man,</v>

70
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the truth is something that</v>

71
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Burns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it burns off deadwood and people don't</v>

72
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 2>like having their dead wood burn it off</v>
<v Speaker 2>often because they're like 95 percent</v>

73
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 2>deadwood and I'm not being an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe me,</v>

74
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm not being snide about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no joke.</v>

75
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 2>When you start to realize how much of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you've constructed of yourself is</v>

76
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 2>based on deception and lies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a horrifying realization and it</v>

77
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 2>can easily be 95 percent of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your things.</v>

78
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 2>You say things you act out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it's well,</v>

79
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.820
<v Speaker 2>you see that in Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I often you discuss,</v>

80
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 2>you know Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he gets corrupt,</v>

81
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 2>as he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as he matures,</v>

82
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 2>he first learns to lie and then he</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes a brain jackass on pleasure</v>

83
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 2>island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

84
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 2>and he's threatened by the underground</v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarians,</v>

85
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

86
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 2>They're going to sell them to the salt</v>
<v Speaker 2>mines.</v>

87
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.084
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

88
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly right man.</v>

89
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 2>So then you figure out your uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain jackass and you're lying all the</v>

90
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible realization.</v>

91
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 2>And then all that needs to be burned</v>
<v Speaker 2>away and no,</v>

92
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:10.350
<v Speaker 2>people don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ties into lake a misconception,</v>

93
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 2>is that a natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a funny thing,</v>

94
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 2>like when I worked in the video game</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>

95
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a platform games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you jim from little platforms and seven</v>

96
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 2>times the EPA light platforms that move</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and Mario type things in some</v>

97
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 2>video games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you jump up on a moving platform</v>

98
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.240
<v Speaker 2>and then jump down and fall down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will fall down because platform</v>

99
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 2>moves out from underneath you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you jump up and you move with</v>

100
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 2>the platform and you land on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what the program did right</v>

101
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.880
<v Speaker 2>now a friend of mine was doing a video</v>
<v Speaker 2>game and one of the programs that said,</v>

102
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you jump up and then jump down,</v>

103
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 2>the platform should have moved out from</v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath you.</v>

104
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 2>So you should be able to like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to,</v>

105
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.423
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 2>this is the way we should program the</v>
<v Speaker 2>physics.</v>

107
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 2>And then my friend Matt said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

108
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he couldn't convince this other guy.</v>

109
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 2>So eventually what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

110
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:00.700
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're gonna do is we're going to go</v>

111
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 2>out onto the road with my pickup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my pickup truck,</v>

112
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get in the back and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to drive along at 30 miles an hour</v>

113
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to jump straight up in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>air and we'll get to see whether I land</v>

114
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 2>in the truck or a land on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they did this experiment and the guy,</v>

115
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.370
<v Speaker 2>the other guy who was driving the truck</v>
<v Speaker 2>was totally expecting him to late jump</v>

116
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:20.800
<v Speaker 2>up in that full out of the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truck because the truck went moved dog</v>

117
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 2>because he's moving the same speed as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trucks may jumps up and then he</v>

118
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 2>lands back in the truck and this that.</v>

119
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.150
<v Speaker 2>This is illustrating the video game</v>
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

120
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 2>I had the exact same misconception that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flat earth is due because they say,</v>

121
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if the earth is moving so fast?</v>

122
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you just go up in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopter,</v>

123
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 2>hover a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait for the Earth to move underneath</v>

124
00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then go back down again.</v>

125
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.360
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

126
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 2>it's completely backwards physics</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you already moving,</v>

127
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.520
<v Speaker 2>so you'd have to slow down to zero a</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the same as speeding up and</v>

128
00:05:49.521 --> 00:05:54.250
<v Speaker 2>relatively speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the point is that anyone can make</v>

129
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.390
<v Speaker 2>misconceptions about physics like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

130
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 2>And it's easy to get sucked into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's actually quite hard to break</v>

131
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 2>them even flow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is reasonable guy who was like,</v>

132
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:04.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>video game program,</v>

133
00:06:04.501 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 2>but who presumably knew something about</v>
<v Speaker 2>physics.</v>

134
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 2>He was convinced that Matt was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall out to the back of the truck and</v>

135
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 2>quite possibly die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they still let him do the</v>

136
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>
