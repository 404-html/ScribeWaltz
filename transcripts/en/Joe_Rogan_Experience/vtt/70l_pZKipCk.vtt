00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.500
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Gal that I was dating once said to me,</v>

2
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:07.020
<v Speaker 1>never trust a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any girlfriends.</v>

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you say that?</v>

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

8
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go and the girls don't want to</v>

9
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:18.360

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

10
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.260
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

11
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.011
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

12
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>how come they don't like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls don't like that girl.</v>

13
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't have any girlfriends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's one or two things have happened.</v>

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Either you just moved into town or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked everybody's boyfriend.</v>

15
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just looked at,</v>

16
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:36.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this bitch is too smart.</v>

17
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm an 18 at least 18% more chimpanzee</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

18
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotta get Outta here.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm a kiss on the cheek.</v>

20
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.580
<v Speaker 2>And then the other cig Ma don't hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to go.</v>

21
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 2>That should be a short series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan's defining moments</v>

22
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.430
<v Speaker 2>a moment like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a good one,</v>

23
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.800
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some serious knowledge on me.</v>

24
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.010
<v Speaker 1>She dropped some serious knowledge on</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

25
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>She looked me in the eyes when she said</v>
<v Speaker 1>it too.</v>

26
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:14.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like a really strong move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

27
00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:16.210
<v Speaker 1>don't ever trust a girl who doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>any girlfriends.</v>

28
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>And I remember seeing him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I,</v>

29
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I remember saying to our goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like cocky because I was 24 when</v>

30
00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 1>she said this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

31
00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck you buy?</v>

32
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:27.101
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is say,</v>

33
00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:27.934
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about,</v>

34
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some girls are assholes.</v>

35
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I just,</v>

36
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she,</v>

37
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.850
<v Speaker 1>after she said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

38
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.260
<v Speaker 1>the girls know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know who you are.</v>

39
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.820
<v Speaker 1>And I just went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

40
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.200
<v Speaker 1>that can't even argue with you.</v>

41
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only equivalent I have to that,</v>

42
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 2>and I hate to use his name twice and one</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

43
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Bordain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patrice,</v>

44
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I fucking wish I anymore beautiful trees</v>
<v Speaker 2>said to me one night,</v>

45
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.710
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to his black dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're sitting in the back of the</v>

46
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:00.750
<v Speaker 2>envelope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Boston comedy club.</v>

47
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 2>We're sitting down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bench in the corner by the</v>

48
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 2>window and we're sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking,</v>

49
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 2>we're sitting talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's watching me the whole time.</v>

50
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 2>And I'd just recently tried to grow a</v>
<v Speaker 2>beard for the first time.</v>

51
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

52
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.120
<v Speaker 2>we get up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy gets up and he moves and patrice</v>

53
00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 2>sits down next to me was the fuck you</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing talking to him.</v>

54
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.450
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

55
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't ever talk to a black man that</v>

56
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have facial hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's this have to do with it?</v>

57
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:23.040
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

58
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.420
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any black man</v>

59
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 2>has facial hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facial hair,</v>

60
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 2>fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I started looking around at</v>

61
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:38.541
<v Speaker 2>every black dude I knew how facial hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like the greatest little fucking</v>

62
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.930
<v Speaker 1>patrice didn't even believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was only saying that because it was</v>

63
00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:42.764
<v Speaker 1>the funny thing.</v>

64
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.160
<v Speaker 2>It was a bug with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time he goes,</v>

65
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.990
<v Speaker 2>you got to learn how to trim your lip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

66
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was white guys.</v>

67
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:51.160
<v Speaker 2>We'll let the hair grow into their lip</v>
<v Speaker 2>and black guys don't do that.</v>

68
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Dates up on the lip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

69
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>

70
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.000
<v Speaker 2>one of the weird things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics is people always,</v>

71
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 2>even if it was one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most profound</v>

72
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>experiences ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one most amazing experiences ever,</v>

73
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>people would tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 1>But it was just your mind playing tricks</v>
<v Speaker 1>on you.</v>

75
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't matter and you can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

76
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>But it's whether it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether I really did travel to another</v>

77
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>dimension and communicate with infinite</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings that were made out of love and</v>

78
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>understanding who told me the secret to</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is positive energy and positive.</v>

79
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Even if it was just my imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still experienced it.</v>

80
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I experienced it as if it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whether it was real or whether it</v>

81
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>wasn't real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the exact same result.</v>

82
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Something happened that was unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

83
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 1>It took me to someplace that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely beautiful and then something</v>

84
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like either that happened or it didn't</v>

85
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well definitely happened.</v>

86
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if it was imaginary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if it was only inside</v>

87
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>my head.</v>

88
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>The whole world comes out of the inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your head.</v>

89
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>When we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

90
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>they would say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

91
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>he's got such an imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one.</v>

92
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 1>It was talking about kids who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>liars,</v>

93
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how people treated the</v>

94
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 1>imagination and the kids were just</v>
<v Speaker 1>fevers.</v>

95
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's imagination to some</v>

96
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:03.671
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

97
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>some people they didn't think it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to be encouraged,</v>

98
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's really where everything comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

99
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's the weirdest thing about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the imagination conjures up an idea</v>

100
00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>in which becomes a laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It conjures up an idea which becomes an</v>

101
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 1>airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all comes from the imagination,</v>

102
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 1>whether it's artistic or whether it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>song,</v>

103
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the weirdest thing ever.</v>

104
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 1>And everybody wants to pretend that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so normal.</v>

105
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.950
<v Speaker 1>And so normally just thinking shit up</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the middle of fucking nowhere and</v>

106
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>creating nuclear power.</v>

107
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.211
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you do it?</v>

108
00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:37.460
<v Speaker 1>You sat down and what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wrote some stuff on some,</v>

109
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 1>a pad and then you figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's this all coming from?</v>

110
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Where's the idea to even do that coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>

111
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Where's the idea that some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy wants to be like a fucking bird</v>

112
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 1>and put wings on and figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly.</v>

113
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 1>And he eventually figured it out and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just travel all over the world and we</v>

114
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 1>don't think anything of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

115
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>the imagination is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The imagination has done some amazing</v>

116
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>things for human beings in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet we still don't give her the</v>

117
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 1>credit it deserves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

118
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of shocking.</v>

119
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination is like the most underrated</v>

120
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 1>thing of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet it's the foundation of our</v>

121
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 1>advancement in evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you hopeful about things when you</v>

122
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 1>see like Arab spring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were rising up and trying to</v>

123
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>remove dictators and what happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt?</v>

124
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Getting rid of Mubarak?</v>

125
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.330
<v Speaker 3>I am hopeful and I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is happening all over the</v>

126
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:25.990
<v Speaker 3>world and I think the Internet has</v>
<v Speaker 3>played a part with it and it's happening</v>

127
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 3>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

128
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

129
00:05:28.431 --> 00:05:30.610
<v Speaker 3>I come here as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a foreigner,</v>

130
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm British.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I come to,</v>

131
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 3>I come to America often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

132
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 3>I have family here in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel very closely connected with</v>

133
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:40.810
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And America is a paradox.</v>

134
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.730
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge paradox because on the</v>

135
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:44.640
<v Speaker 3>world's stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

136
00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 3>America is a very dark and malignant</v>
<v Speaker 3>force,</v>

137
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

138
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.890
<v Speaker 3>which does tremendous harm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

139
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.700
<v Speaker 3>consistently and has done for a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

140
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 3>But at the individual level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a tremendous spirit of awakening</v>

141
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 3>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

142
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:03.740
<v Speaker 3>just what's happening with cannabis laws</v>
<v Speaker 3>in America in the last,</v>

143
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 3>the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's unimaginable in Britain.</v>

144
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 3>We can't make changes like that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have this spirit of</v>

145
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 3>independence.</v>

146
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 3>We don't have the structure where</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual states can make decisions on</v>

147
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 3>key issues like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

148
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 3>and of course in America there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict between state law and federal</v>

149
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 3>law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

150
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 3>the federal government is not always</v>
<v Speaker 3>respecting state laws and is seeking to</v>

151
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 3>persecute people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are using cannabis.</v>

152
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that in itself,</v>

153
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 3>the fact that a number of states have</v>
<v Speaker 3>decriminalized or even legalized</v>

154
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:35.260
<v Speaker 3>cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

155
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 3>is a sign of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sea change that is underway at the</v>

156
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what it reflects is an awakening of</v>

157
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 3>the American people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even though,</v>

158
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge negative forces are still at work,</v>

159
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 3>and I still sitting in the seat of</v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

160
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a tremendous hope for</v>

161
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:55.710
<v Speaker 3>the future in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that comes from the,</v>

162
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 3>the awakening to consciousness of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>American people.</v>

163
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.220
<v Speaker 3>And maybe it's small right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's growing and in that sense,</v>

164
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 3>far more than any other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe America is leading the world.</v>

165
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 3>That there is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this possibility for awakening</v>

166
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe it goes back to the,</v>

167
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the founding fathers on the frontier</v>

168
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.881
<v Speaker 3>days and just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

169
00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:16.281
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

170
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:19.760
<v Speaker 3>the sense that that people should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to make decisions about their own</v>

171
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 3>lives without government telling them</v>
<v Speaker 3>what to do.</v>

172
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 3>That's the step we all need to take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to move ahead.</v>

173
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:29.291
<v Speaker 3>We need to set aside our commitment to</v>
<v Speaker 3>these large monolithic religions.</v>

174
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:32.360
<v Speaker 3>We need to set aside our commitment to</v>
<v Speaker 3>large,</v>

175
00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:35.660
<v Speaker 3>monolithic states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to run our own lives and make</v>

176
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 3>decisions for ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just happens that that is very</v>

177
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:41.660
<v Speaker 3>close to the heart of what America is</v>
<v Speaker 3>all about.</v>

178
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:47.110
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

179
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.380
