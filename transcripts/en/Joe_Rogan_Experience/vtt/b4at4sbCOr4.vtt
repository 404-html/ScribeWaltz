<v Speaker 1>it was fine.</v>

154
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

155
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Was a blast.</v>

156
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 1>I would have a pool table in a heartbeat.</v>

157
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I love having one brush with this one.</v>

158
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.210
<v Speaker 1>This is from the 1970s.</v>

159
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a gold crown too.</v>

160
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.103
<v Speaker 1>Scratching</v>

161
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.713
<v Speaker 1>fucker.</v>

162
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.573
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>

163
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.373
<v Speaker 3>hello?</v>

164
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.181
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

165
00:08:26.181 --> 00:08:27.980
<v Speaker 1>high ball goes in and you scratch.</v>

166
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:28.814
<v Speaker 1>You don't win</v>

167
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.270
<v Speaker 1>anywhere on the table.</v>

168
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

169
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.460
<v Speaker 1>you have is a nightmare.</v>

170
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not a victory.</v>

171
00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:42.900
<v Speaker 2>You have a one ball that's wide open,</v>

172
00:08:42.901 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 2>but the two balls tied up with the eight.</v>

173
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.920
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to play to eight combination then</v>

174
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>all have to go off of one more,</v>

175
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:49.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

176
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

177
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you can possibly knock those balls free once you make the one ball.</v>

178
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Do you see last standing?</v>

179
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.660
<v Speaker 2>The new one?</v>

180
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:56.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

181
00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.180

<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you right pocket.</v>

256
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.560
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the universe doesn't love you.</v>

257
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:36.540
<v Speaker 2>This is interesting.</v>

258
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Play pool as the good person that knows how to play pool and somebody is able to</v>

259
00:11:41.021 --> 00:11:41.854
<v Speaker 2>leave their shots.</v>

260

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.793
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

262
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.350
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>

263
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

264
00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:55.570
<v Speaker 2>I can do it too.</v>

265
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 2>All ended up there.</v>

266
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.073
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

267
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.220
<v Speaker 4>we should ask you a question.</v>

268
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:06.780
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

269
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Did you go for the five ball that way as opposed to this way?</v>

270
00:12:10.351 --> 00:12:10.651
<v Speaker 2>Cause it,</v>

271
00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:11.191
<v Speaker 2>but they do do that.</v>

272
00:12:11.191 --> 00:12:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I shot,</v>

273
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:16.650
<v Speaker 2>I have two shots a on site as possible or fly ball here.</v>

274
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.030
<v Speaker 2>The problem playing the size,</v>

275
00:12:18.031 --> 00:12:19.740
<v Speaker 2>but we're gonna have to hit it lighter have,</v>

276
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.730
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't come back properly cause I have a bad angle.</v>

277
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:24.811
<v Speaker 2>I honestly,</v>

278
00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:26.130
<v Speaker 2>if I did want to come back,</v>

279
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.800
<v Speaker 2>I would want to have an angle just about</v>

280
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:35.930
<v Speaker 2>two inches that way so that I could stay on this side of the ball because that's</v>

281
00:12:36.031 --> 00:12:37.230
<v Speaker 2>what scares me right there.</v>

282
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.801
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

283
00:12:37.801 --> 00:12:38.611
<v Speaker 2>it's not scary.</v>

284
00:12:38.611 --> 00:12:39.391
<v Speaker 2>But this side pocket,</v>

285
00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>

286
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.150
<v Speaker 2>I now I'm not going to play.</v>

287
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:42.721
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

288
00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:47.721
<v Speaker 2>I'm playing because of the angle plane to come down here and then shoot this</v>

289
00:12:49.711 --> 00:12:54.150
<v Speaker 2>ball in the side pocket because the angle's not good though.</v>

290
00:12:54.151 --> 00:12:54.984
<v Speaker 2>The Pool,</v>

291
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.700
<v Speaker 2>when you play a certain level,</v>

292
00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.610
<v Speaker 2>it's all about um,</v>

293
00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.100
<v Speaker 2>maintain the correct angle to go from one ball to the other.</v>

294
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.083
<v Speaker 2>Ideally,</v>

295
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.930
<v Speaker 2>I would've liked to stop anywhere around right here.</v>

296
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.471
<v Speaker 2>So funny.</v>

297
00:13:07.471 --> 00:13:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

298
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:08.551
<v Speaker 2>I would have stopped.</v>

299
00:13:08.551 --> 00:13:09.630
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't try to stop here.</v>

300
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.760
<v Speaker 2>There's I one with that shot as opposed to the natural.</v>

301
00:13:11.761 --> 00:13:12.780
<v Speaker 2>That's good too,</v>

302
00:13:12.781 --> 00:13:13.950
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to,</v>

303
00:13:13.951 --> 00:13:15.120
<v Speaker 2>once I make the ball,</v>

304
00:13:15.121 --> 00:13:19.530
<v Speaker 2>I want to wind up right around here and we're in town right now.</v>

305
00:13:19.531 --> 00:13:23.160
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to do that because we're telling right now the natural angle of</v>

306
00:13:23.161 --> 00:13:25.500
<v Speaker 2>shooting the ball and it's going to make the ball go this way,</v>

307
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.850
<v Speaker 2>so now I have to adjust to that and I have to make the ball go this way and then</v>

308
00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:34.851
<v Speaker 2>out here and I have to hit it and I hit up to here with low right hand English</v>

309
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.490
<v Speaker 2>so that when it hits the table,</v>

310
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:39.361
<v Speaker 2>it's the rail,</v>

311
00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:41.010
<v Speaker 2>it bounces off and gets good.</v>

312
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.080
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that I noticed is whenever I break,</v>

313
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.180
<v Speaker 2>I break with Tom English.</v>

314
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.700
<v Speaker 2>I've only broken that way.</v>

315
00:13:52.701 --> 00:13:53.450
<v Speaker 2>I've never broken.</v>

316
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.283
<v Speaker 2>You broke,</v>

317
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:55.760
<v Speaker 2>you broke using the bottom.</v>

318
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.010
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if you could stop the ball.</v>

319
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I like to use bonding,</v>

320
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.270
<v Speaker 2>but some people do like to talk as a plow suitable.</v>

321
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.513
<v Speaker 4>When you hear something</v>

322
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:10.331
<v Speaker 2>said they're good at pool,</v>

323
00:14:10.331 --> 00:14:10.750
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

324
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:10.961
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

325
00:14:10.961 --> 00:14:11.794
<v Speaker 2>but how good are you?</v>

326
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.100
<v Speaker 2>I just hope I don't get left for them.</v>

327
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.460
<v Speaker 2>Easy shot and I can't make that right.</v>

328
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:36.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

329
00:14:36.941 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things where I find that,</v>

330
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:40.114
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

331
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.770
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking about like archery play,</v>

332
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.060

333
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:49.791

336

337
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:57.170
<v Speaker 1>That was good.</v>

338
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.003

339
