This episode is brought to you by stamps.com stamps.com is a way for you to cut

3
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.640
out all the nonsense of having to go to the post office to send packages.

4
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.930
It's a simple,

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.960
easy way where you can use your PC or a Mac and turn it into your own personal

6
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.430
post office that never closes.

7
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.820
You can buy and print official US postage for any letter or package using your

8
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:33.270
computer and printer.

9
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.430
Then just hand your mail to the post man or drop it in a mailbox and you're

10
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:41.160
done.
You never have to go to the post office again.

ordinarily have to go through.

30
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:59.151
The annoyance of leaving your domiciles and traveling to a far off land where

31
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:03.480
you're going to have to talk to someone,
pay them a shitload of money,

32
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:05.730
make an appointment,
do it by the way,

33
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.160
between the hours of eight and five because that's when the office is open.
Oh,

34
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.340
legit egg.

Everybody wants,

43
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.240
That's the problem with laws.

44

That's the problem is there's good things about laws and bad things.

45
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.240

49
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:07.360
specific direction,
but they are not a law firm.
Okay.

50
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.320
Legal help is furnished through vetted independent attorneys.

51
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.060
It's one of the things that's important.

52

If you're in the middle of filling all that stuff out and you run into a sheer

54
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:20.980
panic,
you're like,
oh my God,
I'm going to fucking jail.
No,

55
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.270
you will not go to jail.

56
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.960
Legal Zoom will connect you with an independent attorney that will say,
hey man,

57
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:29.140

67
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.920
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com this is the last commercial

68
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:09.910
hang in there.
You're almost there.

69
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.450
O n n I t what is on it on it is a human optimization website.

70
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.080
What we sell is the very best strength and conditioning equipment we can get our

71
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:24.190
hands on.
We sell the best fitness DVDs we can get our hands on.

72
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.930
We sell,
we even sell antibacterial,
natural soap.
Okay.

73
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.110
Defense soap.
One of the things you find out if you get into martial arts,

74
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:35.950
especially Jujitsu as you get a lot of funky skin things going on,

75
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:40.951
like ringworm and there's staph infections and shit that people get and one of

76
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:45.850
the ways that your body becomes more susceptible to these things is an absence

77
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:50.530
of healthy flora.
And that comes from,
you can get that from probiotics.

78
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.800
If you are of the vegetarian inclination,

79
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:56.620
you can actually get probiotics through Sauerkraut.

80
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.560
A raw sauerkraut is actually very healthy for you and probiotic.
Um,

81
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.130
if you eat milk,
uh,
acidophilus is an excellent source of,
um,

82
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.840
of uh,
probiotics.
Um,
Kombucha is my favorite Kombucha tea.

83
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:13.330
It's easy to,
I liked the way it taste.
Some people don't like it,

84
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:16.330
but I think it's delicious.
It's like a soda that's not sweet.

85
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.760
Like a guilt free soda that's healthy,

86
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.170
it tastes good and it takes care of your body.
Um,

87
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.630
but one of the things that people make a mistake of is when they have any sort

88
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:29.890
of a skin thing,
they use antibacterial soap that contains chemicals will,

89
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:33.640
all that does is it kills all the stuff that's on your skin.

90
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.490
The good flora as well.
There's healthy bacteria.

91
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.650
Your body's in a constant state of balance.

92
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.260
That's why if you ever take antibiotics,

93
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:43.960
one of the most important things to do is also when you're,

94
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.800
when you get done taking the antibiotics to sort of replenish your system,

95
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.690
you're supposed to take probiotics,

96
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.930
you're so you're reintroducing healthy bacteria to your gut.

97
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.300
Well that healthy bacteria is also on your skin.

98
00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.020
Defense soap is a way to the healthy bacteria on your skin and it does.

99
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:03.920
So with natural oils,
tea tree oil,
eucalyptus oil,
it smells good.

100
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.970
It's good for your skin.
It doesn't kill any of the healthy bacteria.

101
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.300
It just sort of gives you a healthy environment for good bacteria to grow and

102
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.280
discourages all that funk.

103
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.900
So we sell that shit and on at.com we also sell the best kettle bells we can
buy.

104
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.650
We sell strength and conditioning equipment in the form of battle ropes,

105
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:28.100
steel maces,
steel clubs,
ab wheels,
medicine balls,

106
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.760
all that kind of groovy shit and the highest level supplements that we can get

107
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:37.520
our hands on as far as cognitive supplements,
Alpha brain,

108
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:39.320
which is um,

109
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.040
this the premiere nootropic supplement that I've ever used.

110
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.640
It's also got a double blind clinical trial.
Uh,

111
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.570
the results are all printed and available online at [inaudible] dot com and

112
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:55.571
another double blind placebo controlled clinical trial is ongoing right now,

113
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.600
a much larger one to prove the efficacy of Alpha brain,

114
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:02.420
but the individual ingredients have actually already been proven.

115
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.600
All the research is available at [inaudible] dot com if you go there,

116
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.960
you're curious about any of this stuff.
One of the things to think about,

117
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:13.961
about with on it is that we offer a 100% money back guarantee on the first 30

119
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:19.610

120
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:20.444
You get your money back.

121
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.290
What we're trying to do is introduce you to stuff that I use that my friend

122
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.000
Aubrey uses that all my friends that have enjoyed Alpha brain and all my friends

123
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:31.700
that are into supplements and vitamins and understand the efficacy of these

124
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:36.200
things and understand like what's the benefits of supplementation as along with

125
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:37.430
the benefits of healthy diet.

126
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.770
It's one of the things that you keep hearing about in the news all the time.

127
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:44.090
People say all your needs are healthy diet sort of.
You know,

128
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:46.760
you just want to stay alive.
Yeah,
all he needs a healthy diet.

129
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.550
But if you want to optimize your life,
optimize your life,

Optimize your body.
Um,
supplementation does work.
It's in,
you know,

131
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:58.460
the idea that there's no science behind it is pretty ludicrous cause it's all

132
00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:00.290
science based.
It comes from science.

133
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:03.680
These things aren't discovered in a cave somewhere by a guy who's like a quote

134
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:08.000
unquote explorer.
All right,
these things are all been synthesized,

135
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.950
either synthesize or extracted.

136
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:14.120
All all this stuff is because of science and the research is all up and

137
00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:18.740
available at [inaudible] Dot com that's o.

00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:07.740
hey pal,
you're not even from here.
What's going on?
Why are you shitting on us?

148
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:12.150
What about your,
your country man?
Um,
thanks for joining me man.
I appreciate it.

149
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.730
Thanks Jeff.
Thanks having me on,
Mike,
please.
I appreciate it.
Um,

150
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.830
I watched a very fascinating interview today or conversation that you had today

151
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:24.360
about the religious right and how much hate do you get on a daily basis?

152
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.640
Cause like you're,
you're going hard here man.
You got,

153
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.500
you got Uncle Sam Crucified on your book.
I mean,
my,

154
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.570
I always told people that when they asked me,
where do you leave?

155
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:37.170
I always say southern California and I never give the exact address because,
uh,

156
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.980
there is a fat wire pulled out on me.
Actually the,
and no joke,

157
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:42.450
the Westboro Baptist Church,

158
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:47.370
which we all know very well when my first book was released in o nine,
uh,

159
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.440
the title is God hates you,
hate him back.

160
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.890
They sorta title without understanding what the content of the book was.

161
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:55.350
An unfortunate I must have been on their side and therefore to,
hey,

162
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:59.260
we've got somebody who's written a book in Pro Avow our mission.
Uh,

163
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.630
once I took a look at my book,

164
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:04.200
they realize how off base that was and I was attacking them for some of their

165
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:05.390
beliefs.
And uh,
uh,

166
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.910
Fred Phillips actually issued a public fatwa to have me killed.

167
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:12.390
So I want to leave my addresses southern California because I do have kids,

168
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.050
but he's dead.
Right.
Does that fat,
why I have any,
any teeth?
I Dunno.

169
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.910
Do you inherit a fat worthy?
We'll do.
It's a good question too.

170
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.450
It's just to get passed down on those show.
Well,

171
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.950
whatever happened to Solomon and t like he's around now.
Yeah.
He's,

172
00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:27.510
he's now out in the open.

173
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.260
I think that maybe people who want other people did,

174
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:34.710
particularly literally literal people is they have short memories.

175
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.100
Well,
he was a,
that was a weird one,
man.
He wrote a book that,

176
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.210
that people had interpreted as being about the Prophet Muhammad.

177
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.610
But it wasn't necessarily right.
No,
it's more about the poetry which was written,

178
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.650
you know,
on a,
on a segment of Islam.

179
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:57.030
And it wasn't actually taking scripture from the core and itself.
So I mean,

180
00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:57.960
what he,
uh,

181
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:03.020
wrote would be very mild in say comparison to a South Park episode where the

182
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.040
Prophet Muhammad is dressed up like a bear.

183
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.300
Islam is a very fascinating religion to me in so many different ways.

184
00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:13.140
But it's also fascinating in that liberals have,
for whatever reason,

185
00:11:13.141 --> 00:11:17.820
chosen that as being the one to defend in some weird sort of a way.

186
00:11:17.821 --> 00:11:22.380
Like anytime someone criticizes Islam,
they become Islamophobic.

187
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:27.150
But you will never hear like certain segments of the progressive population shit

188
00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:29.730
on someone who is criticizing Christianity.

189
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:32.550
You don't become a Christian of phobe.
That's,
I mean,

190
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:36.660
you've hit on a very important point here.
The problem,
I mean,

191
00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:40.410
Chris Hedges wrote a great book called the death of Liberalism in America.

192
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.100
The liberal class no longer exist in America.
It has no voice.

193
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.400
And to underscore that point,
Hillary Clinton's popularity,

194
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.700
Hillary Clinton doesn't,
she doesn't stand at fair populous.
Economic,

195
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.370
social doesn't stand for progressive clauses that she's causes.
She's a brand.

196
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:59.370
<v 3>And a brand only said a liberal class has been left to be the political police</v>

197
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:03.940
force for,
you know,
PC correctness.
And that's it.
So,
whilst you know,

198
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:07.570
you have Democrats in office who are,
who are attacking liberalism,

199
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:11.860
things like the welfare state,
um,
free trade and so forth.

200
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:14.740
You had president Clinton who'd gutted the unions,

201
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:19.690
destroyed welfare and implement a Nafta,
which outsourced 800,000 jobs abroad.

202
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.900
Um,
you're,
you're left with a liberal class at all.

203
00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:24.780
I do is a eight wine and cheese or you know,

204
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.730
wines and cheeses and pick up people who were saying the wrong things

205
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:31.180
politically.
So,
so,
uh,
you know,
I have a problem with political correctness.

206
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.770
<v 0>Yeah.
Pick on people who are saying the wrong things.
You know,
that's,</v>

207
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.080
that's the big one.
Saying the wrong things,
not actions,

208
00:12:38.081 --> 00:12:41.860
not picking on people in the,
the Islamic phobic one.

209
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:46.660
That to me is a weird one man.
Like if you're going to be scared of any religion,

210
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:50.470
in my opinion,
it might eat,
you might have a good,
it's a good one to pick.

211
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:54.460
Islam is a good one when they're the number one suicide bombers,

212
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.540
the number one people that are the things that they're doing to women and

213
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.230
Islamic countries.
The things that you're seeing in the news.

214
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:05.800
On a daily basis that are from predominantly Islamic countries.

215
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.410
If you're gonna be scared of a religion,
that seems to be a good one.

216
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.140
<v 3>Yeah.
But my point is that that's happening over there.</v>

217
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.300
If we're going to worry about what's happening here,

218
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.750
you're far more likely to be cooled by a right wing terrorists and you are

219
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:17.800
buying Islamic terrorists.

220
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:23.100
Since 1990 there's been 345 Americans killed a by American Muslims,

221
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.510
whereas it's only been 20 Americans killed by a Muslim Americans.

222
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:31.650
You can't count the nine 11 to attack us as Muslim Americans because they're

223
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.350
external.
I have a foreign fighters fighting for a phone call,
so I,

224
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.620
that's why I think the most dangerous threat to American democracy in our

225
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:42.100
secular values is not,
he's allowed facism.
It really is.
You know,

226
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:46.570
there's Christian theological whack jobs that represent what is the tea party,

227
00:13:46.571 --> 00:13:48.670
which is really a pro to a fascist movement

228
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.010
<v 0>in this country and this country.
Country.
Yeah.
In this country.
Yes.</v>

229
00:13:53.011 --> 00:13:57.050
You definitely need less likely to be attacked by an Islamic terrorists.
Yeah.

230
00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.020
That's because America is doing its job and keeping us safe.
Over here,

231
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.230
we fight over layer so we can keep you safe over,
I mean,

232
00:14:04.231 --> 00:14:08.970
I'm not exactly sure if that is a a zero sum game.
I'm not,

233
00:14:08.971 --> 00:14:12.690
I'm not sure how that is working or if it's working or if it's just some massive

234
00:14:12.691 --> 00:14:15.090
debt that we're going to have to come back and pay.

235
00:14:15.091 --> 00:14:17.430
Sort of like the housing crisis,
you know?

236
00:14:17.431 --> 00:14:19.290
I mean it kind of seems like it doesn't it?

237
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.400
<v 3>Well,
it,
it's blowback.
I mean,
we've met all in,</v>

238
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.240
we've meddled in the Middle Eastern fairs for so long and we wonder why she had

239
00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:29.900
happens.
I mean,
you know,
if you listened to the conservatives,
they'll say that,

240
00:14:29.901 --> 00:14:31.670
you know,
they want to attack us for our freedoms.

241
00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:34.340
I want to attack us because we like drinking beer or watching porn on the

242
00:14:34.341 --> 00:14:37.230
Internet.
You know,
they have a very,
very specific agenda.

243
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:41.240
I hate the fact that we have our fucking military bases in the middle of the

244
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:41.530
Holy Land.

245
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:45.260
I hide the fact that we're not willing to operate in a bipartisan manner to

246
00:14:45.261 --> 00:14:49.060
solve with the Israeli Palestinian situation.
And,
uh,

247
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.070
so that's why they're angry.
You know,
it's nothing to do really

248
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.220
<v 2>with religion.
And if you actually look at uh,</v>

249
00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.790
all terrorists attacks over the world,
95% of all suicide bombs,

250
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:03.170
a bombing attacks had been committed against occupying forces rather than being

251
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:04.670
in religiously motivated event.

252
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:10.420
So religiously motivated in that they have inspired these people to attack well

253
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.890
blow themselves up with,
with religion.
Good point.
What it is,

254
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.800
you got the power structure wherever.
That's,
you know,

255
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:21.830
if you go all the way back to some had been loud and could say here's the top of

256
00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:25.460
our Qaeda,
they have very,
very specific political objectives.

257
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.870
Obviously the fundamentalist Islamic,
you know,

258
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.190
lowest common denominator in society who's starving and doesn't have a job,

259
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:37.370
has no future.
They're the ones that are recruited to carry out the dates,

260
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.940
but there's certainly a very rather politically motivated rather and religiously

261
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:42.950
motivated.
Yeah.

262
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.870
I would assume that if you are living in a country and you have a giant,

263
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.410
huge empire that is invaded,

264
00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:54.440
not just your country but hundred different countries,

265
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:58.010
we have military bases and more than a hundred different countries all over the

266
00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:00.920
world.
I would,
I would feel like you would want to resist that.

267
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:05.420
Like that would naturally be something that people would be,
you know,

268
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:06.140
resisting.

269
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:10.430
Imagine of JFK airport was a Saudi national airport and it flying the fighter

270
00:16:10.431 --> 00:16:13.960
jets in and out there and doing loops of New York City all day long.
Yeah.

271
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.863
Well man,

272
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.900
you've got guys in the south and the confederate states would love the blog,

273
00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:20.410
the capital because there's a black man in the White House.

274
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.720
Imagine if there was an input well up til you would see Jay,

275
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.130
would you fancy accent?

276
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:30.160
You tell me how else are we going to keep America safe to try this point?

277
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.700
How can you,
I mean that,
that is the big question.
Like say what?
I mean,

278
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.050
I don't know what the real number is,

279
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:40.310
but it's more than a hundred more than a hundred military bases and more than a

280
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.000
hundred different countries all over the world.
Yeah.

281
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.700
Like people talk about the Roman Empire.
Rome doesn't have shit on America.

282
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.980
It's a joke.
It's like not even close.
Like,

283
00:16:48.981 --> 00:16:53.240
this is the craziest Ambar fucking is con fuck.
All those audit other people,

284
00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:54.830
those amateurs that came before us.

285
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.800
This is the nuttiest empire that's ever existed.

286
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.550
How could you ever pull,
how do you pull that back?
What?

287
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.290
Like look what's going on in Iraq right now.

288
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:08.330
There's this void that is being filled now buy these,

289
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:09.800
these jihadists,

290
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:14.950
once we're pulling out the American troops and the Iraqis are being inundated

291
00:17:16.191 --> 00:17:20.900
with these various terrorist groups,
this isis organization,
and it's scary stuff.

292
00:17:20.901 --> 00:17:22.450
When you see what happens when the,

293
00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:27.050
the predominant power military power in the area pulls out and then it's left

294
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.910
this vacuum in this power struggle.
What,
what is the solution?
Well,

295
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.820
you first have to look back at the,
the root cause of it all.

296
00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:38.870
And the root cause was we drew up fictitious way.
The West,
not just theU ,

297
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:43.000
but way the West draw me buddy.
I wasn't involved pretty late.

298
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.140
So we drew up fictitious borders and we said here,
uh,

299
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.160
basically you said the three different people,
you know,
the Kurds,
as soon

300
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.160
<v 3>as the she has,
here's a country we're going to draw the board.
He's now,</v>

301
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.420
the board is now coexist and get along and Kumbaya.
Um,

302
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.600
what happens,
of course it's um,
those three,
you know,

303
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.530
three different sectarian sex can't get along.
So you needed a hard man,

304
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.530
a dictator to keep the people suppressed and controls.

305
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:09.120
So it get leaves internal strife out,

306
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:14.010
remove him like we did and then not replace it with a suitable alternative

307
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:15.480
leaves is massive power vacuum.

308
00:18:15.481 --> 00:18:17.130
And that's why we have the situation where we are today.

309
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.700
We have all that civil war.
Um,
so as the solution,

310
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.860
do you continue having a,
uh,
uh,
a hard line dictator like Saddam Hussein,

311
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:29.100
which was,
you know,
obviously,
you know,
a brutal,

312
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:32.580
oppressive a guy or do you just withdraw?

313
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.290
Obviously there has to be a midpoint where we,

314
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.200
it has to be political social solution and that's the only way out of this.

315
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.680
A political solution.

316
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.250
<v 0>No,
but how,
how do you organize a political solution when you're faced with these</v>

317
00:18:42.251 --> 00:18:46.630
overwhelming numbers of jihadists and people blowing themselves up and soon

318
00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.550
these verses that she has is the whole,

319
00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.330
the whole place is just overrun with turmoil.
I mean,

320
00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:56.420
how does that ever become a political solution?
That seems like a,
just a,

321
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.620
a phrase that you can use.
We need a political solution,

322
00:18:59.621 --> 00:19:01.030
but what does that really mean?

323
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.710
<v 3>Might a political solution.
I mean,
the only way forward,</v>

324
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.310
the only answer this is you draw a rock up into three different countries,

325
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:12.050
but America will never allow that because you'll end up with the Kurds having

326
00:19:12.051 --> 00:19:13.910
being a proxy state to Turkey,

327
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.870
we will end up being the Shia majority in the south,
being a proxy state of Iran.

328
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.220
Saudi Arabia will never allow allow that because they're our ally ran,

329
00:19:22.221 --> 00:19:25.970
which is our natural ally for the wrong reasons.
But the alley or a natural ally,

330
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.230
um,
well the u s will never allow that Ala.
So the workable solution,

331
00:19:30.231 --> 00:19:33.380
it's three different states,
but America is never gonna allow that to happen.
So

332
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.040
<v 0>this is a massive shits tall.
She shits though.</v>

333
00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.650
Did you see the recent interview with Dick Cheney where he said that his number

334
00:19:41.651 --> 00:19:46.651
one regret was that he didn't invade Iran at the same time as Iraq plays?

335
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.230
Mother,
father is made at a pure evil.

336
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:55.300
They need a scrape that guy and put him in a test tube and find out he might not

337
00:19:55.301 --> 00:19:58.260
even be human.
I know how he,
I think he's Po,
you know,

338
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:02.740
see if he said he's a demon when he didn't have a heartbeat.

339
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:07.240
Remember that when he had that fake heart in a artificial heart that was keeping

340
00:20:07.241 --> 00:20:11.620
him from having a heartbeat,
he had no pulse.
Isn't that in the Bible somewhere?

341
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.120
I mean,
I,
I guarantee you there's a religious text somewhere about a war monger.

342
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.500
Someone who brings death and destruction through the land.
He has no pulse.

343
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:22.030
His heartbeat,
if not,

344
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:27.260
I mean that was like ally bank guy who differed from the Vietnam War and it was

345
00:20:28.481 --> 00:20:32.440
never times five times,
five times.
It was never drafted,

346
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:34.660
figured out a way to weasel his way out of the system,

347
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.900
got to a position where he runs a company that what they profit off of is

348
00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:43.600
rebuilding things that the military blows up.

349
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.720
They get these giant corporate giant contracts to places that the United States

350
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:49.841
military blows up.

351
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:53.980
And then he becomes the vice fucking president of the United States and starts

352
00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:58.120
blowing shit up and then they start making money and he starts making money from

353
00:20:58.121 --> 00:21:01.690
the company that he used to be a part of pure evil.
It's unbelievable.

354
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.330
<v 3>And this is something I write about a lot,
is you know,
America,</v>

355
00:21:05.331 --> 00:21:07.970
what America is today as a corporate totalitarian state,

356
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.200
and how the difference is a great book by a,
you know,

357
00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.330
democracy and cooperated by Sheldon Wallen who was a Harvard or I think might

358
00:21:15.331 --> 00:21:18.500
still be a Harvard professor.
And he says in the classical touch,

359
00:21:18.501 --> 00:21:21.770
hell attarian state something like Nazi Germany or style on this Russia,

360
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.490
you have a charismatic figure at the top.
And it's where it,

361
00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.620
in a classical totalitarian state,

362
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:32.540
it's where politics trumps economics in inverted totalitarianism.

363
00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:36.230
Like we have United States economics,
Trump's politics.
Now,

364
00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.590
everything has been sold to the highest bidder in this country.

365
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.380
So corporations run anything.

366
00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:46.270
And you've touched on such a good point with Halliburton,
Jeremy Scahill,
uh,

367
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.100
you know,
for if dirty wars and so forth.
I'm a huge fan of,

368
00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:53.960
he spoken a length how at the height of our occupation in Afghanistan,

369
00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:59.360
we had a total of 250,000 men on the ground in Afghanistan.

370
00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:03.710
Only something like 45,000 Americans,
45% of that footprint,

371
00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:08.840
uh,
was,
uh,
actual American military force.
The rest,
uh,
corporate,

372
00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.530
um,
contractors,
whether it's for food delivery,

373
00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:16.700
where it's around supplying medical or whatever,
or infrastructure rebuilding.

374
00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:21.620
So when you have corporations who profit from war and you'll have a political

375
00:22:21.621 --> 00:22:26.621
class in Washington who only is totally a 100% beholden to these corporations,

376
00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.450
we now live in a,
in a,
in a country where wars are obese,
you know,

377
00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.060
it was a for profit.
That's how,

378
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.210
and we'll make our decisions based on what's profitable and not in the interest

379
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.460
of national security or the American population.

380
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.230
<v 0>The wars are for profit.</v>

381
00:22:39.231 --> 00:22:43.070
And also the wars become a business that you can't,

382
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:44.510
it can't just end.

383
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:47.450
It can't just end that business because then you take people out of work.

384
00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.610
I've heard that argued about the war on drugs.

385
00:22:49.611 --> 00:22:53.780
It's one of the best arguments about the reason why there's so many lobbyists

386
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.880
against legalizing marijuana.

387
00:22:55.881 --> 00:23:00.650
When you look at the actual health risks of marijuana being so minimal and the

388
00:23:00.651 --> 00:23:04.300
actual medical benefits that you have for people that have cancer and aids,

389
00:23:04.301 --> 00:23:06.220
I'm like,
there's so many different ways you can use it.

390
00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.920
Like the idea that this isn't something that someone's decided to like,
Hey,

391
00:23:09.921 --> 00:23:13.500
well we can use this for people and people can benefit.
Why isn't it?
Well,

392
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.240
one of the big ones is because there's a whole business in arresting people in

393
00:23:17.241 --> 00:23:21.410
prison.
People making sure that prison guards stay working,

394
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.860
making sure that prison stay filled,
making sure that it's sheriffs,

395
00:23:24.861 --> 00:23:27.350
that they need a certain amount of sheriffs and need a certain amount of

396
00:23:27.351 --> 00:23:28.040
deputies.

397
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.820
Like there's a whole business behind that and people have to recognize that when

398
00:23:31.821 --> 00:23:32.870
you change a law,

399
00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.620
sort of just like what's going on in Iraq right now with is this giant void when

400
00:23:36.621 --> 00:23:41.360
we pulled out of Iraq,
if you just cut the ties on all these laws and say,
look,

401
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:42.410
this is all legal now,

402
00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:44.840
all you guys that we're arresting people for all this shit,

403
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.580
you're going to have to find some new shit to do.

404
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:50.510
Like there's going to be a mad scramble and they're going to have to figure out

405
00:23:50.511 --> 00:23:51.740
some new way to profit.

406
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.740
Well that's the situation that we're in right now with war.

407
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.630
The mount of money that's coming in from war is staggering.

408
00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:04.631
The percentage of our economy that's dedicated just to war is substantial.

409
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.690
It's far greater than many,
many other things that would be very important.

410
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.220
Inner city restoration,
you know,
education,
public education,

411
00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:17.690
I mean the amount of money that's being spent on tanks and missiles and fucking

412
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.690
just feeding troops and sending people over there.

413
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.740
And then contractors like how Halliburton that are fix this,

414
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:27.110
the just amazing amounts of money that's flowing back and forth.

415
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.520
And to cut that off,
it's like you've got so much momentum and entropy.

416
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:33.200
It's like what?
What do you,
how do you stop that?

417
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.741
<v 3>Well,
I mean,</v>

418
00:24:33.741 --> 00:24:37.460
you're just talking about your talk about the incarceration problem or a prison

419
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:38.570
problem is country.
Again,

420
00:24:38.571 --> 00:24:40.850
that's a not a part of the corporate totalitarian state.

421
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:45.320
Now you take a poor person,
a poor black dry on the streets.

422
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.630
What is he worth to the corporations?
He has no money.

423
00:24:47.631 --> 00:24:50.420
He's not going to spend his money at Walmart or Macy's or whatever.

424
00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:54.890
He has nothing but put that that poor black minority person into a prison.

425
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.330
All of a sudden these,

426
00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.970
these private prison organizations will make $50,000 per year out of taxpayer

427
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.770
money for him being in prison for a nonviolent crime.

428
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:09.110
So when we're trying to dismantle a and,
and find solutions you've,
you've got,

429
00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:11.150
that's the kind of headwinds that you're running against.

430
00:25:11.151 --> 00:25:14.390
This too much influenced the corporations of the political structure.

431
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.570
<v 0>We can have these conversations all day,
right?
Yeah.
But what,
what,</v>

432
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.800
what possible solutions can be offered CJ world,
man,

433
00:25:20.801 --> 00:25:22.830
if you were the president of United States,
he can't be in more people.

434
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.940
<v 2>You,
you got a weird accident.</v>

435
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:26.850
It was good enough around the Watson to get for California.

436
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.250
It's probably good enough for our Swartz Nigga.
Boy,

437
00:25:29.251 --> 00:25:32.310
he fucked his made it'd be the president.
She wasn't even hot.
God Damn,

438
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.100
he's an animal.
He's just one of those guys.

439
00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:36.840
Does the check around and they'll fucker,

440
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:41.410
<v 0>I think if,
if you had,
you know,</v>

441
00:25:41.411 --> 00:25:43.390
if you had a position where they said,
look man,

442
00:25:43.391 --> 00:25:46.690
you seem like a reasonable guy written some great books,
run this thing.

443
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.750
<v 3>Well,
I mean,
the solution for America and uh,</v>

444
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:53.710
and it stops me from getting booked on a lot of shows is the solution is

445
00:25:53.711 --> 00:25:54.860
socialism.
I mean,

446
00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.530
<v 2>you said he just can't bad word.
Yeah.</v>

447
00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.620
Fuck you try and take everybody's money.
And it's slightly

448
00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.750
envy of the rich and so that sort of stuff.
But you know,
Americans,
I,
you know,

449
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.990
nowhere in the West Western

450
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:14.880
<v 3>world is the socialism or the ucs would more,
um,
uh,</v>

451
00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.790
you know,
associated with demagoguery.
Then here,
I mean,

452
00:26:17.791 --> 00:26:22.080
you'd say socialism and American finks of style in this rush or he's Germany.

453
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:26.130
When I hear the word socialism,
I think if the country,
I'm from Australia,

454
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.790
I think of Canada to a lesser extent,
and I think of all of western Europe.

455
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:34.740
Socialism doesn't mean the absence of cap capitalism.
It means where,
you know,

456
00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:39.770
basic human rights are catered for in a structure which is Pintful by the rich

457
00:26:39.871 --> 00:26:43.440
and the corporations.
What we have in America is,
you know,

458
00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:47.880
you've got corporations paying the lowest tax contribution to the federal

459
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:51.010
government.
In US history.
Republicans will defend NCR,

460
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.270
but our corporate tax rate is 35% it is that on paper,

461
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:57.420
the effective rate after of all the loopholes,
after all the deductions,

462
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.420
all the loopholes we've actually been written in Washington by these pro

463
00:27:00.421 --> 00:27:01.254
corporate lobbyists,

464
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:05.130
the effective rate is 12% which makes it the lowest amongst all our weed seed

465
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:05.964
eight countries.

466
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.380
And that's the reason why America doesn't have nice things like bridges thing.

467
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:15.210
Like that's why we can't have nice things like you know,
high speed rail.
I mean,

468
00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.780
you know,
you look America today,
it looks like a third world country.

469
00:27:18.781 --> 00:27:22.530
I've spent 10 years of my life in Indonesia the last 10 years before I moved

470
00:27:22.531 --> 00:27:27.390
here.
America basically it looks like Bangladesh with white people,
you know,

471
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.500
and it really does,
nothing works but a high schools are falling apart.

472
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.310
Our WRAL is running off its track.

473
00:27:33.311 --> 00:27:35.270
So bridges are collapsing into water below them.

474
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.150
Not One us city is ranked in the top 20 most livable cities in the world.

475
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.720
Not One USA.
A port is ranked in the top 100 airports in the world.

476
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:47.280
And that's because we are true.
Yeah,
it's true.
And it's because we have no,

477
00:27:47.281 --> 00:27:48.600
we've starved the federal government,

478
00:27:48.601 --> 00:27:51.990
the revenue it needs to build a happy society.
You know,
a happy society.

479
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:56.220
You go to Europe and I'm always staggered by my hardcore conservative friends or

480
00:27:56.290 --> 00:28:00.120
debates I have on,
in,
online or in interviews on radio panels and so forth.

481
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.640
And you know,
I hear conservatives come back from Europe,
get God,

482
00:28:02.641 --> 00:28:05.910
I had a lovely holiday.
It's so nice.
You just see no poverty.

483
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.680
The public transport work,
you know,
works like,
you know,

484
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:13.500
you can set your watch to it.
Um,
you know,
and uh,
and you get,

485
00:28:13.501 --> 00:28:14.101
we will,
you know,

486
00:28:14.101 --> 00:28:17.070
you wonder why because they have a state where corporations are paying their

487
00:28:17.071 --> 00:28:18.240
fair share in Germany,

488
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:22.030
which hit the economic hard times at the same time we did in Hawaii.

489
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:26.550
They're economy is booming because they have a good blend of social democracy

490
00:28:26.551 --> 00:28:29.410
and capitalism.
They made a law in Germany where fee,

491
00:28:29.411 --> 00:28:32.250
if you have a company of more than 50 employees,

492
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.660
at least 50% of your board must be represented by the working for us.

493
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.760
So the working force,

494
00:28:38.761 --> 00:28:43.440
50% of your board must be elected by 50% of the labor force in that company.

495
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.040
Oh,
okay.
So the,
the folks that work within whatever you make,

496
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.830
the along the line,
they have a vote.

497
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:52.950
So half of them have to be elected by those people.

498
00:28:52.951 --> 00:28:55.380
So they have to represent the needs and wants of the people that work for that

499
00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:58.290
company.
Exactly.
That's fascinating.
You know,
and,
and Germany's booming.

500
00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:00.850
It hasn't Staffold Germany's Burp,
but the opposite of the,

501
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.770
the American white at the moment is,
is still trickle down economics.

502
00:29:04.771 --> 00:29:09.360
And you look at Kansas,
Kansas,
which is basic laboratory for tea party,

503
00:29:09.361 --> 00:29:10.950
hardcore conservative thinking,

504
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.970
they put the most aggressive tax cuts on the rich that we've seen in the last 20

505
00:29:14.971 --> 00:29:19.971
or 30 years total Reaganomics in 2010 now I've got a $348 million budget,

506
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.910
you know,
a blowout.
Um,
and now,

507
00:29:23.911 --> 00:29:27.420
now they can have to cut education and services to deport and safety wealth net

508
00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.510
net because he got his budget hall that they can't explain now I'll tell you

509
00:29:30.511 --> 00:29:31.380
that.
You're fucking explain it.

510
00:29:31.381 --> 00:29:34.950
You're just took a massive cuts to the rich and corporations and nothing comes

511
00:29:34.951 --> 00:29:36.130
back for it.
Well there,

512
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:40.710
there is definitely a real problem in America with when you were talking about

513
00:29:40.711 --> 00:29:42.100
the paying a small

514
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.210
<v 0>amount of taxes and then you look at the infrastructure,
the infrastructures,</v>

515
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.360
there's some shaky spots in this country.
Especially like New York City,

516
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:52.600
that Brooklyn Bridge just had a giant collapse recently.
You see that?
Yeah.

517
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.660
There's some big chunk of it just fell down like,
yeah,

518
00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:58.120
you got to fix that fucking thing man.
Like how much,

519
00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:03.150
where's all that money going?
Especially when you consider like in New York they,

520
00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:06.350
they have to pay tolls everywhere.
Like every time you go somewhere,
what is,

521
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:08.530
what's the,
what is it like seven bucks or nine bucks?

522
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:13.090
I think we looked up as like seven 50,
seven $57 and 50 cents.

523
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.220
I mean that's,
that's lunch somewhere.

524
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:18.310
And when we got to pay that every time you drive across a spot

525
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.790
<v 3>and you and I have to pay for that,</v>

526
00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:22.250
or the people in the middle class in New Jersey,
you have to pay for it.

527
00:30:22.251 --> 00:30:25.940
And that's because the wealthy pioneer share of taxes in that state.

528
00:30:25.941 --> 00:30:28.220
So the middle class,
the ones that get lumped into the tax bill,

529
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:32.260
<v 0>isn't it fascinating that when you start talking about this kind of stuff,</v>

530
00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:34.630
we started talking about socialism,
that the rich pay,
their share,

531
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:39.280
the big resistance seems to come from a lot of poor conservative people.

532
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:43.060
When the big resistance is socialism comes from these people that,

533
00:30:43.061 --> 00:30:46.990
I don't know if it's like they have this idea in their hand that one day they're

534
00:30:46.991 --> 00:30:51.880
going to be prosperous.
So they don't want you muck it up for their chances.

535
00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:57.360
But I found this quite fascinating that like one of the big resistances to the

536
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:02.380
ideas of communism or the ideas of socialism,
and these are just ideas,

537
00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:03.214
just bringing them up.

538
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.280
But a knee jerk reaction comes from the lower middle class or middle class

539
00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:09.340
conservative folks.

540
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.540
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean,
what John Steinbeck,
uh,
you know,
I said it best.
He said,
you know,</v>

541
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.390
Americans that temporarily embarrassed millionaires,

542
00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:17.373
<v 0>whiting</v>

543
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.760
<v 3>one in this country thinks,
again,
if you're rich,
you know,
that's the thing,</v>

544
00:31:25.761 --> 00:31:29.810
you know,
that's that individual rugged Islam,
which Americans believe in it.

545
00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.850
And it's very hard to break that.

546
00:31:31.851 --> 00:31:35.270
You've got the working class in these red belt states,
uh,

547
00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.490
which are voting for a Po for party,

548
00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.540
which exclusively is only benefiting hitting the top 1%.
You've got,

549
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.861
I mean,

550
00:31:42.861 --> 00:31:47.720
how does a poor person and say Mississippi or Alabama pull the lever for the

551
00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.501
Republican Party who is blocked?

552
00:31:48.501 --> 00:31:51.890
The expansion of Medicaid basically blocked the expansion of universal

553
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.490
healthcare.

554
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:55.430
One of the biggest predicate is of poverty is your access to healthcare.

555
00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.170
If you don't have it,
you're destined for poverty.

556
00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.350
And they vote against that only because I said Jesus a few times,

557
00:32:00.351 --> 00:32:02.960
and before they get to the polls and Hallelujah,
you know,

558
00:32:02.961 --> 00:32:04.000
you're just wanting you to self a vote.

559
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.080
<v 0>I met a lot of folks don't realize that that all started with Reagan.</v>

560
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:11.040
Reagan change politics in America with his embracing of the religious right and

561
00:32:11.041 --> 00:32:12.690
using them as a political base,

562
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:17.250
as a base of people that you can guarantee you're going to vote for you if you

563
00:32:17.251 --> 00:32:18.840
start talking.
Jesus.
Yeah,

564
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:23.140
<v 3>I mean Reagan morally,
Marlene,
financially bankrupt,
this country.</v>

565
00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:26.770
Not only did he bankrupt this country with trickled down economics fiscally,

566
00:32:26.771 --> 00:32:30.940
but he also bankrupt this country because he taught Americans a whole generation

567
00:32:30.941 --> 00:32:34.720
of Americans.
How the height the pole.
Um,
and that's where we out today.

568
00:32:34.721 --> 00:32:39.350
That's why it's so easy for people in the right to a,
to cut veterans benefits,

569
00:32:39.351 --> 00:32:40.340
cut food stamps

570
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:45.020
<v 2>and so forth because it comes down to that Christian,
uh,
you know,
welfare fee,</v>

571
00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:48.620
uh,
our prosperity theology.
Uh,
if you're rich,

572
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.220
even though Jesus was a Marxist before Mark's has had an Marxism,
had a name.

573
00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.910
If it Richard means Jesus has bestowed great wealth on you because you're

574
00:32:55.911 --> 00:32:58.820
honorable in New York,
you are pious.
But if you're poor,

575
00:32:58.821 --> 00:33:00.050
it means you must be a sinner.

576
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:03.880
And if all of the blacks and Hispanics support means Jesus heights and you know,

577
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.250
so it'd be dealing with,
with them.
What about poor white people.
Jesus loves them.

578
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:08.241
He loves them,

579
00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:11.120
but they still need to fend for themselves because ironically they get their

580
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:14.960
philosophy from mine.
Rand who is an atheist,
I n ran.
That's a,

581
00:33:14.961 --> 00:33:16.290
that's a hilarious one.

582
00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:20.460
The iron rand one is a really interesting one cause that's,
that's one that the,

583
00:33:20.461 --> 00:33:25.220
the libertarians seem to cling to and the pull 'em up by your bootstraps,

584
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.220
pull themselves up by their bootstraps attitude.
You know,

585
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.680
it's easy to think like iron man.

586
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:32.660
If you're born into a privileged white neighborhood area,
go,

587
00:33:32.661 --> 00:33:35.630
everyone's got an equal shot.
What are you talking about?
Yeah,

588
00:33:35.631 --> 00:33:37.730
I love Canada and any,

589
00:33:37.731 --> 00:33:41.360
any ideas that anybody has against what you're talking about,

590
00:33:41.361 --> 00:33:44.540
like socialized medicine,
it's not the best in Canada.

591
00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:47.030
Like I have friends that live up there and they say it like they've hurt their

592
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:50.780
knee and had to wait 10 months to get a surgery and that sucks.
That's not cool.

593
00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.980
Yeah.
But they're nice as fuck.
They're educated as fuck.

594
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:56.780
Education is free.

595
00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.470
You get good universities all over the country that are pretty much commensurate

596
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.520
so you don't have this thing.

597
00:34:01.521 --> 00:34:05.960
We have to fly all the way to New York to go to Nyu or go to boulder to go,

598
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.561
you know,

599
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:10.040
you can go to a neighborhood university and you're going to get an excellent

600
00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:10.874
education.

601
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:14.030
It's a different sort of an environment up there and that's a problem because

602
00:34:14.031 --> 00:34:14.280
we've,

603
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:19.010
we've capitalized and privatized the education system to hear such a degree.

604
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:20.160
I mean if you,

605
00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:25.160
if you've got a degree in Australia where rights Macquarie University or Sydney

606
00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:25.850
University or University of New South Wales,

607
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.300
it's an Mba at one of us schools is exactly same as an NBA.

608
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:33.980
Then one of our schools here,
you know,
you're not only does an Mbi matter,

609
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.140
but all of a sudden then it has to be from the right school.

610
00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:40.940
So an Mba from Harvard or an Ivy League school is Trump's and NBI from

611
00:34:40.941 --> 00:34:43.460
university of San Diego or something like that.

612
00:34:43.461 --> 00:34:45.800
And that shouldn't be the way and affect what that does.

613
00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:50.210
It still keeps propelling that plutocracy because there was a study done that at

614
00:34:50.211 --> 00:34:53.790
least for every student at Harvard aged children and have,

615
00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:58.760
it has at least one parent owning at least $400,000 per year.
So we,

616
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.690
we're still,
you know,
with the capitalization of everything,
we,

617
00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.790
we're forming a system where we have,
you know,

618
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.390
the very wealthy at the top and we have,

619
00:35:05.391 --> 00:35:08.200
everybody's struggling at the bottom that the elite is,

620
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:11.750
I'm involved in education is really fascinating to me today,

621
00:35:11.751 --> 00:35:15.260
especially because there's so much access to information,
so many books,

622
00:35:15.261 --> 00:35:17.750
so much online,
so much to read and just,

623
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.950
you can get so much access to information that would,
you know,

624
00:35:21.951 --> 00:35:22.850
a long time ago,

625
00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:26.360
the difference between going to Harvard and going to San Diego state was pretty

626
00:35:26.361 --> 00:35:30.140
gigantic.
But what with what you have access to today,

627
00:35:30.141 --> 00:35:34.340
the average person has access to the exact same information that they're

628
00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:37.980
teaching at any school,
anywhere.
But I had a conversation

629
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.600
<v 0>with a friend of mine and,
uh,</v>

630
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:44.310
he was wrong about something and I brought up this woman who,
uh,
had,

631
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.100
you know,
she had went to the University of Mississippi,

632
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:51.250
but she went there and this was her major,
like this thing that she,

633
00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:54.210
that we were talking about.
And he goes,
well,
this guy went to Yale,

634
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.550
but he didn't even go to Yale for that.

635
00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.520
He went to Yale for something else and he's 80.
Okay.

636
00:35:59.521 --> 00:36:01.980
So he went to Yale and like the 1960s,

637
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:04.410
who knows what the fuck they were teaching back then?

638
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.480
Like what are you talking about man?
You know,
like,
but the eye,

639
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:11.460
his first initial reaction was,
look,
she went to the University of Mississippi,

640
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:14.490
he went to Yale.
I'm like,
oh,
that's hilarious.

641
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:16.740
But that is the way we think in this country.

642
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:19.830
<v 3>It is.
And also not only as a way we think,
but you know,</v>

643
00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.630
these kids that are going to wear my tee or Harvard or Yale,

644
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:26.140
well it's the networks they take with them.
So when the jobs are available,

645
00:36:26.141 --> 00:36:26.950
you know,
the,

646
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:30.370
the only growth area that we have in this country as a technology jobs.

647
00:36:30.371 --> 00:36:34.540
But that's such an Angela job market where only the networks,

648
00:36:34.541 --> 00:36:37.510
the alumni from these prestigious schools get the really apply from it.

649
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:41.170
All the kids working at Google,
they all went today's,
you know,
fancy schools.

650
00:36:41.171 --> 00:36:42.850
It could be afforded by the wealthy parents.

651
00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.380
<v 0>Yeah.
That's kind of creepy that,
that the,</v>

652
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:47.920
the is him a month to education I think is kind of creepy.

653
00:36:47.921 --> 00:36:52.090
And it's also creepy that you wind up having these like skull and bones type

654
00:36:52.091 --> 00:36:56.770
organizations where all these people inside these,
you know,
George Bush.
Yeah.

655
00:36:56.771 --> 00:36:59.230
These fraternities and John Kerry.
Yeah.
You know,

656
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.520
they get into these frat terministic groups,
these,
you know,

657
00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:08.140
very insulated groups and they feed off of each other and they,
you know,
they,

658
00:37:08.141 --> 00:37:12.340
they become very nepotistic and they help each other in business and they form

659
00:37:12.341 --> 00:37:16.930
these little teams together.
I,
I founded in,
in sitcoms and sitcoms.

660
00:37:16.931 --> 00:37:19.960
It was fascinating that a lot of the writers had went to Harvard,

661
00:37:19.961 --> 00:37:24.010
they worked for the lampoon and like they would recruit other guys from Harvard

662
00:37:24.011 --> 00:37:27.700
and there was like those were the guys that they wanted a higher as writers.

663
00:37:27.701 --> 00:37:29.380
And I was like,
guys,
really fascinating.

664
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.500
Like you guys all went to this little club together so you,
you know,

665
00:37:32.501 --> 00:37:33.790
you're feeding off each other.

666
00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:36.920
<v 3>Yeah.
And in the meanwhile I get from the camera and say,
I did it all myself.</v>

667
00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:39.290
I'm self made,
you know,
so

668
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.440
<v 0>well at this point there is no self made theirs.
We,</v>

669
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:48.370
one of the things that Obama made a critical blunder with was this whole,

670
00:37:48.371 --> 00:37:50.820
you didn't do that yourself.
You don't feel that.
Yeah.

671
00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:52.900
If you made your own business,
you didn't build that.

672
00:37:52.901 --> 00:37:57.160
I thought it was a huge blunder because instead of celebrating,
you know,

673
00:37:57.161 --> 00:38:01.480
someone who does innovate and create their own business and get out there and do

674
00:38:01.481 --> 00:38:02.650
it.
And he said of,
you know,

675
00:38:02.651 --> 00:38:06.130
saying this is a great thing and more people can do this and more people can

676
00:38:06.131 --> 00:38:09.910
contribute.
Instead he kind of focused on the negative aspect of it.

677
00:38:09.911 --> 00:38:13.650
Instead of saying something along the lines of,
I think it could have been,
look,

678
00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:17.470
I couldn't imagine what the workload of a guy like Obama is.
You know,

679
00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:21.340
how much time does he have to actually consider every chess move that he makes?

680
00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:24.650
Everything that he says,
how it's going to be interpreted,
what's,
you know,

681
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:26.290
how's it going to be twisted and turned.

682
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:30.460
But that was a big blunder cause it seemed like an obvious checkmate move.

683
00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.020
<v 3>It was actually that the,</v>

684
00:38:32.021 --> 00:38:35.590
the you didn't build it was taken a little bit out of context because,
uh,

685
00:38:35.591 --> 00:38:39.340
the full,
the full transcript of that,
he mouthed muddled the punch line.

686
00:38:39.341 --> 00:38:43.570
Basically he was channeling Elizabeth Warren who had given a speech earlier on

687
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:47.290
that and basically saying,
you know,
the universities which taught those kids,

688
00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:48.850
you didn't build that the roads,

689
00:38:48.851 --> 00:38:52.180
which year he taking the truck sign in using transport to deliver your goods to

690
00:38:52.181 --> 00:38:56.800
market.
You didn't build that,
um,
uh,
and the bridges and so forth.

691
00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:57.970
And he met,

692
00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:02.920
he messed up the execution of the point and then it was caught on bicycle in
men.

693
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.290
Every entrepreneur in America.
You didn't build your business.

694
00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:06.190
But that certainly wasn't

695
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.650
<v 0>it.
Was it?
Yeah.</v>

696
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.700
Even saying it in that fashion saying you didn't make those roads,
you Duh,

697
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:17.310
Duh.
Everybody knows that man.
You're like,
what?
Why concentrate on that.

698
00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:22.320
Why not say,
but you know,
you did a great thing.
You created your own business.

699
00:39:22.321 --> 00:39:24.210
But in order for that business to prosper,

700
00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:27.270
we need the infrastructure that all of us are contributing to.

701
00:39:27.271 --> 00:39:30.930
We need the educational system that is going to bring up the new workers that

702
00:39:30.931 --> 00:39:34.170
are going to be a part of your company.
We need the,
the roads are going to try.

703
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.390
We need all these things.
We all work together.

704
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:39.160
<v 3>You,
you understand that jar and you know,
because you're,</v>

705
00:39:39.161 --> 00:39:43.390
you're literate on politics but limit people like libertarians and it's crazy,

706
00:39:43.391 --> 00:39:45.400
right?
Wing Republicans,
they don't understand that.

707
00:39:45.401 --> 00:39:48.730
They think these bridges and roads and infrastructure comes from Finnair.

708
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:50.970
They believe that,
you know,
actually the libertarian,

709
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:54.150
I believe the tax rate should be almost zero,
you know,
and uh,

710
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.230
the corporations will provide everything.

711
00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:01.050
<v 0>My only problem with taxes is that I feel like most people that are in positions</v>

712
00:40:01.051 --> 00:40:03.690
of government,
like I just,

713
00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.270
I just feel like the,

714
00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:10.230
the system that we have currently set up is so inherently flawed that throwing

715
00:40:10.231 --> 00:40:14.160
more money at it is just going to make a larger bureaucracy gonna make more
jobs,

716
00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:16.650
more regulations,
more people and that,

717
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.410
that whole system that sort of feeds off of the money.

718
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.410
Like we were talking about with private prisons or we were talking about with

719
00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:26.850
prison guards and keeping drugs illegal in order to feed this machine.

720
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.840
When you make the,
the business of government larger and larger,

721
00:40:30.841 --> 00:40:35.400
I don't necessarily think that's the best way to fix the problems that we have.

722
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:38.760
I don't necessarily think that I've had this argument with friends that are very

723
00:40:38.761 --> 00:40:41.790
liberal that we just need higher tax rates and I'm like,
no.

724
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:44.850
Then you're going to have more government and I don't think more government is

725
00:40:44.851 --> 00:40:49.320
the answer.
I don't think more regulations,
more people,
more things,
more forms.

726
00:40:49.321 --> 00:40:53.010
You have to fill out more people that are in some strange office and more that

727
00:40:53.011 --> 00:40:56.490
have to justify their existence.
I don't necessarily think that's the answer.

728
00:40:56.610 --> 00:41:00.720
I think it has to be some sort of a top down organization,

729
00:41:00.721 --> 00:41:05.460
reorganization of the very structure of this society operates under because

730
00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:10.300
right now it's,
it's this foundation of this unfixable bullshit.
It's just,

731
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:15.510
it's so flawed that throwing money at it is like putting gum on a breaking dam.

732
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:19.980
It's like you need more than that.

733
00:41:19.981 --> 00:41:24.981
You need some sort of a comprehensive philosophy designed to reconstruct this

734
00:41:28.771 --> 00:41:32.230
whole situation from the bottom up,
from the top down the hole.

735
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.010
<v 3>Exactly.
And,
and you know what?
I</v>

736
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.160
<v 0>would argue that you know,</v>

737
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.660
the way you rebuilt in a car in your economy is ever is the opposite of

738
00:41:38.661 --> 00:41:41.270
interview.
Every conservative politics or economics.

739
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.760
How do you build a call to me,
and this,
I'm not an economist,

740
00:41:43.761 --> 00:41:45.900
but I listened very attentively to people like,
you know,

741
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.440
Robert Reich or Jared Bernstein or Paul Krugman,

742
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:53.570
guys who are Nobel laureate economist in their own right.
And the pro,

743
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.050
the Roy,

744
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:57.140
the reason the American economy isn't growing despite the fact that we have

745
00:41:57.141 --> 00:42:00.470
record numbers in Wall Street to spot the fact that the official unemployment

746
00:42:00.471 --> 00:42:04.520
rate is falling,
the unemployment writings is falling,
but not with jobs that pay.

747
00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:07.130
Well,
it's always the service paid jobs and so forth.

748
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:10.430
What's happening is we're not having shared prosperity.
You know,

749
00:42:10.431 --> 00:42:14.490
we have the minimum wage level,
which is blood and nine in 69 level.
Um,

750
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:19.340
the middle class income has stagnated and has fallen since 1979.

751
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:24.320
So while you have corporations today sitting on record $3 trillion profit,

752
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.200
that productivity hasn't been shared with the American worker.

753
00:42:27.201 --> 00:42:29.330
And when it isn't being shared with the American worker,

754
00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.440
we live in a consumer economy now,
we no longer make stuff.

755
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:36.890
Heir economy is basically financial services and military.

756
00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.650
So when it comes to financial services,
instead of making products,

757
00:42:39.651 --> 00:42:40.610
we make stuff up.

758
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:45.260
So if we have a consumer economy and we recognize that,

759
00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:49.190
then the middle class and working class need more.
It needs more to spend.

760
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:51.950
And the only way you can do it that is your less than the tax burden at the

761
00:42:51.951 --> 00:42:55.880
bottom.
And you increase the tax burden the top.
So consumers have motor spin.

762
00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.680
And the other one reason these corporations,

763
00:42:57.681 --> 00:42:59.590
despite their record profits aren't hiring,

764
00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.400
is because there's no consumer demand.

765
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.530
What do you say to the argument that that corporations shouldn't have to pay

766
00:43:06.531 --> 00:43:08.750
profits because they're not people?

767
00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.880
The idea that they shouldn't have to pay taxes,

768
00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:13.550
that the people in the corporation pay taxes.

769
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:17.290
So the corporations themselves should not have to pay.
And he said,
that's fine.

770
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:20.930
That's just absurd.
I mean,
these corporations benefit from our airports,

771
00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:23.900
our bridges,
our roads to transport your name out around networks,

772
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:28.970
into state highway systems.
Um,
you know,
r and d technology,
you name it.

773
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:32.840
It's,
um,
but the people that are in the corporation to already do pay taxes.

774
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.950
I'm going all Peter Schiff on you.
Right,
right.
I see where you're going.

775
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.060
The people that are in the,
the corporation is just a group of people.

776
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:44.060
You have all the group of people all pay taxes.

777
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:46.460
The idea that the corporation itself,

778
00:43:46.461 --> 00:43:51.461
this unit has to pay taxes on top of that isn't that sort of justifying this

779
00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:56.930
notion that a corporation is a person,
that a corporation is like an individual,

780
00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:01.310
which is one of the things that they've used to justify corporations being able

781
00:44:01.311 --> 00:44:06.311
to contribute g vast sums of money to political campaigns that a corporation

782
00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.480
like the supreme court has ruled this.

783
00:44:08.481 --> 00:44:12.020
The corporation can sort of act as an individual in that regard.

784
00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:15.900
<v 3>I mean we,
we need to move away from that.
That whole line of thinking.
I mean,</v>

785
00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:20.670
this supreme court is basically radicals in robes and you know,

786
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.590
since Reagan,
I mean,
you know,

787
00:44:22.591 --> 00:44:25.770
it's been a conservative dominated court and for the last three decades,

788
00:44:25.771 --> 00:44:26.860
I mean we haven't had a,
a

789
00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.970
<v 0>a liberal judge appointed to the bench since I'm Lbj.
Who?</v>

790
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.130
The guy that's in the supreme

791
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.830
<v 2>court that said that pedophilia,</v>

792
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:39.360
that know having sex with a man.
It's just like having sex with him.

793
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:42.990
No different than having sex with an animal.
Not a lead over the other guy,

794
00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:47.940
the other big fat guy,
Gal.
Yeah.
Scaleio walked off.

795
00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:52.410
Fuck man,
you're a supreme court judge.
It's like he said,
what did he say?

796
00:44:52.411 --> 00:44:54.960
That if a man wants to have sex with a man,

797
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.150
what's to stop him from wanting to have sex with an animal?
Does that next?

798
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.620
That's exactly what I said.
Whoa son.
For Real.
I mean,

799
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.750
you don't think that people are gay.
I mean,
you don't think that people are born.

800
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.170
I mean,
do you know anybody?
Like,
how could you say,
I mean I've got,

801
00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:12.690
I've got a lot of gay friends and I know that sounds like,
you know,
one of us,

802
00:45:12.691 --> 00:45:16.380
God says like a lot of breakfast,
black friends,
but a good black joke

803
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:20.470
fit.
I do have a lot of gay friends and uh,

804
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.220
and I've been dig very gay parties and uh,
Oh,

805
00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:26.870
I can tell you straight up that not one of my gay friends and said,
man,

806
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.640
I just pounded some mass and I kind of wanted to,
Pam,
your dog

807
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.390
is the next logical step.
Well,

808
00:45:33.391 --> 00:45:36.120
there's no denying that there are certain people that are fucked up and they do

809
00:45:36.121 --> 00:45:39.270
have sex with them.
But you know,
I was young,

810
00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.510
I'm not sure if that's the same.

811
00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:46.950
I don't think that you should be allowed to be a fucking supreme court judge if

812
00:45:46.951 --> 00:45:49.960
those are the sort of connections that you're making.
Might wait.
Lady said,

813
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:50.480
I mean,

814
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.360
the five conservative judges on the Supreme Court are all Catholics and that's

815
00:45:54.361 --> 00:45:57.450
fine.
I've got no problem with that.
But that means that I see a problem with it.

816
00:45:57.451 --> 00:45:59.970
But the supreme court is the highest court in the land,

817
00:45:59.971 --> 00:46:04.020
but you've basically got five out of the nine representatives on that bench who

818
00:46:04.021 --> 00:46:07.980
appeal to a higher authority,
which is the Vatican and the pope.
So I mean,

819
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:09.030
you remember when JFK,

820
00:46:09.031 --> 00:46:12.570
I mean you and I probably too young for a definitely too young when JFK was

821
00:46:12.571 --> 00:46:14.190
elected,
but for when JFK,

822
00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:18.870
his campaign in 1960 the biggest issue against him was the fact he was a

823
00:46:18.871 --> 00:46:23.490
Catholic because Americans were worried that he would have to answer to somebody

824
00:46:23.491 --> 00:46:27.060
outside of the United States and while we have that situation today,

825
00:46:27.061 --> 00:46:28.540
but no one seems to want to talk about it.
Yeah.

826
00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.310
That is a fascinating thing that at one point in time that was a detriment that

827
00:46:32.311 --> 00:46:34.890
him being a catholic was thought to be like a knock.
Meanwhile,

828
00:46:34.891 --> 00:46:38.380
we almost had a fucking Mormon in the president and no one wanted to talk.

829
00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.180
Have Mitt Romney said on my moment is them as off the table and the media went,

830
00:46:42.181 --> 00:46:44.700
oh,
okay,
how the fuck is your Mormonism off the table?

831
00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:49.080
What and why didn't one person,
the media say,
do you still believe that in a,

832
00:46:49.081 --> 00:46:52.020
in the Mormon Heaven,
black people will be your servants?
I mean,

833
00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:57.150
why isn't that a valid question?
You get your own planet and you die.

834
00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:58.770
Yeah.
And do you believe Jesus,

835
00:46:58.771 --> 00:47:02.880
when he given inevitably returns will be to Missouri and you believe that the

836
00:47:02.881 --> 00:47:05.850
American Indians were actually the lost tribe of Israel?

837
00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:11.010
Why didn't anyone ask him that?
Because he said it's off the table.

838
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.300
He believe that Joseph Smith,

839
00:47:12.301 --> 00:47:17.301
who is a fucking con man who found golden tablets at the age of 14 but they

840
00:47:17.971 --> 00:47:20.430
mysteriously disappeared because the angels took them away.

841
00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.620
I would have been happy if Joseph Smith was convicted,

842
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.380
convicted for having sex with an animal or stealing something,

843
00:47:25.381 --> 00:47:29.020
but he was convicted for fraud.
The very thing that is trying to do fraud,

844
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.160
American public,
we have,
so

845
00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:33.370
<v 0>it's really funny that the Mormon Church,
this,</v>

846
00:47:33.371 --> 00:47:38.290
this sect of the Mormon Church that Romney was in involved with was so radical

847
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:42.820
that they moved to Mexico in the 18 hundreds in order to keep having sex with

848
00:47:42.821 --> 00:47:46.660
multiple women.
They wanted to have multiple brides like you know,

849
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.500
the United States said,
hey look,
you can't marry fucking 20 checks,
cut the shit.

850
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.870
And so they go,
fuck you man.
We're going to Mexico.

851
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:56.350
And they went to Mexico back when it didn't matter because it didn't matter.

852
00:47:56.351 --> 00:47:59.470
The difference between United States in Mexico before there was cars wasn't that

853
00:47:59.471 --> 00:48:03.130
great.
You know,
Mexico was like Arizona,
just go down there.
It's no big deal.

854
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.920
We'll be in Mexico.
We'll see you over there and want to come visit us,

855
00:48:05.921 --> 00:48:09.670
get on a horse,
you know.
But then all of a sudden at some point in time,

856
00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:12.970
like America became America and Mexico became what it is today.

857
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:14.800
And like this fucker's are still over there.

858
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:19.090
People don't realize the Romney Church,
they still,
they're still over there.

859
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.190
Romney's dad was born in Mexico.

860
00:48:21.191 --> 00:48:24.000
That's why he couldn't be a president and no one asked for revenues,

861
00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:28.390
burbs certificate.
I tossed the table.
It's off the table,

862
00:48:28.391 --> 00:48:32.590
my Mormon or something.
And my faith is off the table when my dad was born,

863
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:33.460
untouchable,
touchable.

864
00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:38.460
Five guys and the Supreme Court Catholic and the head Catholic guy who I like.

865
00:48:39.161 --> 00:48:42.100
I like this new pope.
I think if you wanted to have a pope,

866
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.990
this guy is the best you could hope for because he has a very conservative chair

867
00:48:46.991 --> 00:48:49.630
that he sits in.
He got rid of that crazy throne.

868
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:53.710
He doesn't drive the pope mobile anymore.
He said,
look at my age,

869
00:48:53.711 --> 00:48:56.590
I have very little to lose or someone wants to take me out here.
I am.

870
00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:59.990
And he also said that he believes that 2% of Catholic

871
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:04.820
<v 3>priests are gay or a pedophile,
but he has an interviewed the other 98% yet.</v>

872
00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:09.890
But how crazy is that?
2% are pedophiles.
Right?
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,
I,
I,

873
00:49:09.891 --> 00:49:13.840
you know,
I'm with you.
I actually wrote a piece for salon on the new pope and uh,

874
00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:18.630
uh,
and uh,
that I wasn't my headline,
but the headline salon put was a,

875
00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:23.360
the lesson atheists can look,
the can learn from Pope Francis and uh,

876
00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.130
I mean,
he's very progressive.

877
00:49:25.131 --> 00:49:27.440
I like the fact that he's denounced trickle down economics.

878
00:49:27.441 --> 00:49:30.050
He's called at an abject failure.
He's talked about the poverty.

879
00:49:30.051 --> 00:49:32.420
This is inflicted upon all countries around the world.

880
00:49:32.421 --> 00:49:36.230
He's talking about the failure of globalization and so forth.
I,
yeah,
I think,

881
00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:41.480
you know,
we still have to remember that he hasn't,
you know,
I denounced,
uh,
uh,

882
00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:45.290
you know,
bigotry against guys.
I mean,
he,
you know,
and so forth.
He hasn't,
uh,

883
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:49.280
and he's still is just starting on their,
their child rape factor.
But yeah,

884
00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:49.581
I mean,

885
00:49:49.581 --> 00:49:52.880
there's certainly good points we've spoken about when it comes to Pope Francis,

886
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:54.450
certainly better than the,
uh,
the,

887
00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:58.130
the former Nazi who moved pedophiles around to different churches because he

888
00:49:58.131 --> 00:50:02.120
busted him giving head jobs to boys.
He was the worst.
He was the worst ever.

889
00:50:02.121 --> 00:50:03.500
He was the scariest guy ever.

890
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.210
<v 0>You don't know.
Pope Benedict,</v>

891
00:50:05.211 --> 00:50:09.710
the guy who was before Pope Francis was involved in a case where he moved a

892
00:50:09.711 --> 00:50:14.550
child molester who would actively target deaf kids.
Oh.

893
00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:18.050
And then he moved them and the guy molested a hundred more deaf kids after he

894
00:50:18.051 --> 00:50:22.490
moved him.
I mean this guy was just a Predator is his naval fuck and the,

895
00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:27.170
you know,
the Pope Benedict,
they've kind of cool down off of what,
you know,
what,

896
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.660
what charges people were rallying against him,

897
00:50:29.661 --> 00:50:32.870
but they wanted to charge him with crimes against humanity.

898
00:50:32.871 --> 00:50:37.040
I mean they wanted the Vatican itself is the way the Vatican works is it's its

899
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:40.070
own state.
Correct.
Like they have their own laws.

900
00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:43.760
It's the last bastion of Fascism in Europe.

901
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:49.100
They also own a gay bath house and you know that does a gay bath house that's

902
00:50:49.101 --> 00:50:52.520
owned or,
yeah.
That's not bill us carnies bath houses.
Well,
I'll pull it up.

903
00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:56.480
Hold on a second.
Okay.
Gay Bathhouse.
Vatican.
It was a big controversy.

904
00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:01.040
This is back when,
um,
homeboy was still the pope,
right?
Yeah.

905
00:51:01.041 --> 00:51:04.970
The Vatican plays landlords to Europe's biggest gay bath house.

906
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:10.400
The Catholic Church paid $30 million to acquire a building that houses a senior

907
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:13.730
card.
No drum roll end.
A huge gay sauna.

908
00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.960
This is on your salon.
You done have pictures downloaded day?
No,

909
00:51:17.961 --> 00:51:20.900
but I have that picture.
That guy's awesome.
God,

910
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:24.860
that was a Ratzinger when he,
um,
when he,

911
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:27.590
when he used to have that crazy golden throne,

912
00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:32.000
he looked like something run out of the fucking Lord of the rings.
I mean,

913
00:51:32.001 --> 00:51:36.470
he really did.
Right?
We've used conch.
God,
he's so sick looking when an evil,

914
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:39.980
fuck that guy.
This is another great picture.

915
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:41.630
I don't know if you've ever seen it of him.

916
00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:47.270
He's sitting there on his crazy thrown and they had these gymnastics guys do

917
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:51.290
some sort of crazy gymnastics demonstration in front of him with their little

918
00:51:51.291 --> 00:51:55.430
tights on and he's sitting there watching this and I'm like this for all the

919
00:51:55.431 --> 00:51:56.870
shit this guy's accused with.

920
00:51:57.020 --> 00:52:00.710
You would think that he would want to be as far away from young men in tights as

921
00:52:00.711 --> 00:52:04.460
humanly possible is pay a consultant needs to be fired.
Oh,

922
00:52:04.461 --> 00:52:09.461
they're so lost and dark and creepy and trying to adjust for all the years and

923
00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:12.450
years of evil that the Catholic church is committed as.

924
00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.120
<v 3>I,
I what I like about the Catholic Church and where you got to say about it as</v>

925
00:52:15.121 --> 00:52:19.380
Pope Francis as the fact that it shows you exactly how man my age religion is

926
00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.430
because I mean Pope Francis is basically coming along and he's trying to adjust

927
00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:25.380
religion to modernity.

928
00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:28.590
So he's basically just miking the rurals off is these guys to adjusted,
you know,

929
00:52:28.591 --> 00:52:30.120
this is like combined via committee.

930
00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:34.130
<v 0>Yeah.
It's so crazy.
Well,
I mean all of it is that way.
I mean,</v>

931
00:52:34.131 --> 00:52:39.131
the whole reason why they had to bring about this idea of purgatory was because

932
00:52:40.101 --> 00:52:44.170
they were trying to convert these pagans and like,
oh yeah,
well,
you know,

933
00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:49.070
you guys have the land of fate.
We got something like that.
So we have this thing.

934
00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.020
Well,
if you're not totally good,

935
00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:54.350
you go to this place and you're in the kind of a waiting room.

936
00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:57.710
<v 3>Yup.
Simon circumcision.
I mean,
we're not trying to sell a circumcision.</v>

937
00:52:57.711 --> 00:52:59.330
The Jewish five two which was a,
you know,

938
00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:04.300
Christianity was a rebranded in from a Hebrewism that go to the German side.

939
00:53:04.301 --> 00:53:05.480
We got this new religion for you.

940
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:08.810
The catch is you've got to cut off the tip of your penis in the Romans are like,

941
00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:09.973
Hey,
wait,
wait.

942
00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.280
<v 0>Oh,
what are you talking about?
Rice?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well it's also the,</v>

943
00:53:13.281 --> 00:53:16.780
the history of all of our major holidays.
I mean,

944
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:20.110
the reason why Christmas is celebrated during the winter solstice,

945
00:53:20.111 --> 00:53:23.650
that was because it was a pagan holiday and they're like,
what a coincidence.

946
00:53:23.651 --> 00:53:27.930
That's when our baby Jesus born.
No,
no,
he wasn't.

947
00:53:27.931 --> 00:53:31.350
If you pay attention to the Bible,
he was born in the spring.
He wasn't,

948
00:53:31.351 --> 00:53:33.580
it wasn't supposed to be born then.
What are you guys doing?

949
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.650
Your fucking moving around the dates.
You guys are assholes.
Sell it.

950
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:41.640
It's hard to pay attention to all that old shit in the first place because it's

951
00:53:41.641 --> 00:53:44.580
so difficult to decipher you going from language to language.

952
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:45.511
And then on top of it,

953
00:53:45.511 --> 00:53:48.270
you've got a bunch of people monkeying with the dates to try to bring in other

954
00:53:48.271 --> 00:53:51.210
people messing up the whole thing.
Man.

955
00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:53.910
It just shows you like how ridiculous it is.

956
00:53:53.911 --> 00:53:58.911
The idea that someone could have said something in stories and songs for a

957
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.530
thousand years before they ever figured out how to write.

958
00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:05.760
And then they started writing things down and then they translated it from one

959
00:54:05.761 --> 00:54:07.830
language to another back and forth,
back and forth.

960
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:11.910
But it's still a hundred percent correct.
And definitely the word of God.

961
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:14.400
<v 3>And you mean,
you know,
uh,
and the,
the,</v>

962
00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:18.500
the Americas in most western Christian nation on the world.
And you know,

963
00:54:18.501 --> 00:54:22.580
something like 85% of Americans have no idea of that historical context of the

964
00:54:22.581 --> 00:54:27.110
Bible,
how it came from Greek and how it was translated by scribes,
you know,
uh,

965
00:54:27.111 --> 00:54:30.950
and,
and so forth in these were stories told in the oral tradition and where to

966
00:54:30.951 --> 00:54:34.310
Gospel's came from and who they were,
who they were,
which we don't know.

967
00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:36.350
We Americans just think that,
you know,

968
00:54:36.351 --> 00:54:40.670
the Bible came down in perfect form from a,
you know,
fell from the sky and then,

969
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:41.563
and that was it.
Yeah.

970
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.250
<v 0>Came from Jesus.
And it's a lot of it,
it's about gay folk,</v>

971
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:48.360
about gay folk and their desire to have sex with animals as well.

972
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:53.510
Keep it away from the children.
Keep it away from the children.
Yeah.

973
00:54:53.511 --> 00:54:55.320
We got a strange world we live in,
man.

974
00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:59.030
We got to a real strange world we live in when it comes to religion because
they,

975
00:54:59.031 --> 00:55:01.830
the,
they focus on certain aspects of the Bible,

976
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.110
but ignore some of the most ridiculous ones.

977
00:55:04.111 --> 00:55:06.780
Like you're not supposed to wear two different types of cloth together.

978
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:10.410
Like there's,
you're not supposed to eat shellfish,
eat shellfish.

979
00:55:10.411 --> 00:55:14.250
You're going to hell.
Do you know that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can't go to red lobster,
man.

980
00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:17.460
You're going to go to hell.
You can't have,
you can't go to the oyster bar.

981
00:55:17.461 --> 00:55:20.880
You're going to rot in a fucking cave somewhere at a red lobster.

982
00:55:20.881 --> 00:55:25.650
You fuck you fuck the whole play red lobster's just like the den of sodomy.

983
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:29.610
Terrible place.
And matter of fact,
it's more hated in the Bible.

984
00:55:29.611 --> 00:55:31.110
It's brought up more often.

985
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:34.480
<v 3>Well,
it's funny.
Was there a bonded group study which showed,
uh,
talked about,
uh,</v>

986
00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:34.830
uh,

987
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:39.830
biblical illiteracy in America and a 25% of Americans believe that Joan of arc

988
00:55:40.231 --> 00:55:41.190
was now his wife.

989
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:45.030
And a 40% of Americans believe Sodom and Gomorrah were a married couple.

990
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:49.620
Oh God.
That's hilarious.
But that also,
you know,
I am a little too often.

991
00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:49.961
<v 0>Well,</v>

992
00:55:49.961 --> 00:55:52.630
there's so few people that actually pay attention to the things that are in the

993
00:55:52.631 --> 00:55:53.140
Bible.

994
00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:55.750
Like I have a friend who was pretty religious and he has a religious tattoo.

995
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:59.560
And I'm like,
dude,
do you,
you got to read the whole book.
You can't,

996
00:55:59.561 --> 00:56:03.070
you're not supposed to wear a tattoo.
And I'm supposed to have tattoos,

997
00:56:03.071 --> 00:56:06.070
especially not religious tattoos,
having a religious sad too.

998
00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:09.370
If God does come back,
he's going to be like,
man,
you fucking miss the point.

999
00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:10.070
Totally.
Yep.

1000
00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:13.250
<v 3>It's on the same level as homosexuality.
Yeah.
All right.
So</v>

1001
00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.490
<v 0>yeah,
it's not,
you're not supposed to get tattooed son.
Okay.</v>

1002
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.610
You're fucking this whole thing up.

1003
00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:21.300
Have you ever read or heard of the sacred mushroom and the cross?

1004
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:25.240
Now the oldest of the Bible is the Dead Sea Scrolls.

1005
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:30.210
And there was a guy named John Marco Allegro who is a,
um,
uh,

1006
00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:33.880
forget where he went to school.
Cambridge or Yale,
whatever it was.

1007
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:38.290
He was a well respected scholar and he was one of the members that was

1008
00:56:38.291 --> 00:56:40.060
deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Right.

1009
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:44.260
And he was the only one out of the whole group that was an agnostic.

1010
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:48.130
And it was because he was an ordained minister.
But during his studies of a,

1011
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:52.480
of a religion,
he realized that it's kind of kind of horse shit.

1012
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:54.370
So he became agnostic,
but he was,

1013
00:56:54.371 --> 00:56:57.430
because he was an ordained minister who still allowed to be on this wasn't a

1014
00:56:57.431 --> 00:56:59.610
vocal agnostic.
Um,

1015
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:03.490
studied the Dead Sea Scrolls for over 14 years,

1016
00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:08.140
and it was his conclusion after 14 years of translations that the entire Bible

1017
00:57:08.141 --> 00:57:09.880
was a huge misunderstanding.

1018
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:13.690
The Christian religion was a huge misunderstanding and it was really all about

1019
00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:18.460
religious ceremonies that were based on the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms

1020
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.460
and fertility rituals.
And that these,

1021
00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:25.170
all these ancient customs were hidden in parables to,

1022
00:57:25.890 --> 00:57:29.920
to cover them up and hide them from the Romans when they were captured and when

1023
00:57:29.921 --> 00:57:32.620
they were in prison and killed,
they would hire,
they would,

1024
00:57:32.621 --> 00:57:36.730
that they would cover up their ancient traditions of these consumptions of

1025
00:57:36.731 --> 00:57:39.880
psychedelic mushrooms and these religious ecstasy that they,

1026
00:57:39.881 --> 00:57:43.150
the religious ecstasy they would,
they would achieve from eating these mushrooms.

1027
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.960
Yeah.
It was a fascinating,
fascinating book,
I guess that lends to it.

1028
00:57:46.961 --> 00:57:50.150
And you go to a site,
you know,
the book of revelation is a,
you know,
a,

1029
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:55.160
a cryptology a book too that's written in code to protect it from being

1030
00:57:55.421 --> 00:57:59.530
interpreted by the Rymans.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He went to Oxford.

1031
00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:01.010
That's where he went.
Um,

1032
00:58:01.350 --> 00:58:06.350
he studied Hebrew dialects and it was a scholar of ancient languages and he,

1033
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:11.650
he wrote this book and it was very quickly bought up by the Catholic Church.

1034
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:14.230
The only way to get this book cause you got to get an old copy of it.

1035
00:58:14.231 --> 00:58:17.710
But in the 1970s,
when the book came out was very,
very controversial.

1036
00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:21.790
Now a guy named [inaudible] urban has republished it through,
uh,

1037
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:25.690
his family that he got permission to do it.
Fascinating,
fascinating book.

1038
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:29.170
There's also another book that he wrote that he wrote a second book because the

1039
00:58:29.171 --> 00:58:30.280
first book I bought out,

1040
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:34.990
the second book was the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian myth.
And it was very,

1041
00:58:34.991 --> 00:58:35.980
very controversial,

1042
00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:40.810
controversial because of the fact that this guy was extremely educated and

1043
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:45.310
agnostic,
very intelligent,
very well respected and rock solid credentials.

1044
00:58:45.311 --> 00:58:47.170
Like you couldn't deny the things that he was saying.

1045
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:51.310
It was the people that read his work.
They mean a lot of his is strange.

1046
00:58:51.311 --> 00:58:55.840
Conclusions were undeniably bizarre in the context of religion.

1047
00:58:55.841 --> 00:59:00.841
Like he traced back the word Christ to an ancient Sumerian word that meant a

1048
00:59:02.141 --> 00:59:04.330
mushroom covered in God's semen.

1049
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:09.730
And that they believed that when it rained,
this is,
you know,
you're talking six,

1050
00:59:09.731 --> 00:59:11.710
10,000 years ago when it rained,

1051
00:59:11.711 --> 00:59:16.090
that was god coming on the earth and that these mushrooms that would appear out

1052
00:59:16.091 --> 00:59:19.390
of nowhere underneath,
it's really crazy because it was,

1053
00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:22.670
it's all based on just a massive cocky party.
Yes,

1054
00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:25.400
a giant Bucatini party of magic mushrooms.

1055
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:30.260
But the long story to get into,
I've discussed it on this podcast before,

1056
00:59:30.261 --> 00:59:33.050
the people that are listening right now probably moaning,
like not again,

1057
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:38.120
but it's also connected to the ancient story of Santa Claus and Christmas

1058
00:59:38.121 --> 00:59:42.090
because these muscles coming,
Santa Claus is coming to town.
These,

1059
00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:45.200
these mushrooms have a microrisal relationship with coniferous trees.

1060
00:59:45.201 --> 00:59:48.610
So like you would find them underneath pine trees,
which is where,
you know,

1061
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:51.410
people always have pine trees as these Christmas trees,
you know,

1062
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:52.244
for trees or whatever.

1063
00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:57.080
And these red and white mushrooms look like Santa Claus.
The,

1064
00:59:57.081 --> 00:59:59.420
you ever seen the Amanita miscarry a mushroom?
Do you know what it is?

1065
00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:04.040
The AMANITA Mascara mushroom is fucking Santa Claus.
I mean,

1066
01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:08.630
a whole that's extraordinary.
Yeah,
it's,
it's uh,

1067
01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:13.050
this is what,
this is what it looks like and all the ancient images.
Wow.

1068
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:16.520
Of Christmas cards,
old Christmas cards.
Jamie,

1069
01:00:16.521 --> 01:00:18.290
see if you can find some old Christmas cards.

1070
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.680
They all used to have pictures of these mushrooms.

1071
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:25.370
There was elves and these mushrooms.
And by the way,
take mushrooms.

1072
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.590
CLS does happen.
Okay.

1073
01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:30.440
It's fascinating that these mushrooms are connected to,

1074
01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:34.100
and also the colors of the mushrooms are exactly the colors of Santa Claus,

1075
01:00:34.101 --> 01:00:38.990
the red and white.
The fact that you hang these stockings by the fireplace,

1076
01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:42.650
like why,
why,
why you have red and white stockings.
What the fuck is that?

1077
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:44.720
Because that's how they dry out these mushrooms.

1078
01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.690
The way they would dry out these mushrooms by hanging them over the fire.

1079
01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:51.950
So these red and white mushrooms were representative.
Look at this.
These photos,

1080
01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.460
see them up there.
Yeah.
Those are all ancient Christmas cards.

1081
01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.820
See the Amanita miscarry,
a mushroom appears over and over and over again.

1082
01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:02.570
And all of these,
it's kind of been lost.
That symbology has been lost,

1083
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.070
but that is the same mushroom that's on the cover of the sacred mushroom.

1084
01:01:07.071 --> 01:01:10.100
And the cross.
If you,
uh,
pull that up,
Jamie,
the book,

1085
01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:12.710
the Sacred Mushroom and the cross,
the John Mako allegro book,

1086
01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:15.770
it's all about this psychedelic mushroom,
the Amanita Mascara,

1087
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:20.950
which is a very confusing mushroom because it apparently varies geographically.

1088
01:01:22.161 --> 01:01:26.000
It varies genetically.
That's the book,
the sacred mushroom in the cross.

1089
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:28.300
Same mushroom.
A,
that's a mess,
right?
Yeah.

1090
01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:33.340
I'm going to go with it and just an incredible sort of a connection,

1091
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.960
but yeah,
it totally makes sense.
If you think about it,

1092
01:01:35.961 --> 01:01:39.140
you're living 10,000 plus years ago,

1093
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:41.480
you find these psychedelic mushrooms,
you eat them,

1094
01:01:41.481 --> 01:01:44.930
you have these intense religious ecstasy experiences,

1095
01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.820
and then the Romans are coming.
You fucking,
you hide the stories.
You,

1096
01:01:49.821 --> 01:01:53.570
you come up with these parables that you can disguise the stories.

1097
01:01:53.571 --> 01:01:58.130
And the apple of Adam and eve supposedly was this Amanita miscarry a mushroom.

1098
01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:00.830
Wow.
That is the,
the,
the word apple.

1099
01:02:00.831 --> 01:02:04.220
There's very many translations for the word apple,
but one of them is red.

1100
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:07.100
The color red and the idea of the eating of the red,

1101
01:02:07.101 --> 01:02:10.780
meaning the eating of this mushroom,
this red mushroom.
Oh my,

1102
01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:13.250
that's extraordinary.
They were tripping balls,
bro.

1103
01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:16.580
They were all tripping balls and trying to write things down.

1104
01:02:16.581 --> 01:02:21.570
And then all along the way it got keep my children away from the gaze.

1105
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:25.770
And what is it that kept them from the,
you know,
the original message?
Well,

1106
01:02:25.771 --> 01:02:28.470
most likely is the absence of the psychedelic experiences.

1107
01:02:28.471 --> 01:02:32.780
These ego dissolving experiences,
which are just forbidden from,
you know,

1108
01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.040
I mean if you look at the modern Christians,
I mean what's,

1109
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:40.050
what's the one thing that they keep the children away from the drugs,
the drugs,

1110
01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:44.430
the evil marijuana and all the things that are ruining our youth now it's ruined

1111
01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:47.820
in your youth is ignorance as to what you're teaching in the very first place.

1112
01:02:47.821 --> 01:02:50.280
Like what are the roots of what you're actually saying?

1113
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.710
So few of them actually even know it.

1114
01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:56.400
<v 3>Oh yeah.
Historical and contextual understanding of the religion</v>

1115
01:02:56.410 --> 01:03:00.550
<v 0>and it's like poor and it's so hard to,
yeah.
I mean a guy like allegro,</v>

1116
01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:03.280
it guys studying this book for 14 years.

1117
01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.820
That's the big thing is that's the oldest version of the Bible we know of.

1118
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.330
That's the oldest version of the Bible.
That's in Aramaic as well.

1119
01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:15.450
So it's trying to add that to what people have just decided is the New

1120
01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:21.100
Testament,
which we all know was,
was con concocted by Constantine.

1121
01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:25.220
They took a bunch of bishops and they threw some shit out and put some shit in

1122
01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.780
the fourth century.
Well after,

1123
01:03:27.610 --> 01:03:32.280
well after Jesus and clearly the hand of man involved clearly.

1124
01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:35.470
<v 3>And that that always blows Christians away when you speak to him.</v>

1125
01:03:35.471 --> 01:03:38.900
And I believe that,
you know,
Matthew,
mark and Luke and John,
uh,

1126
01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:41.710
were eye witnesses to Jesus life.

1127
01:03:41.711 --> 01:03:45.820
But Mike was the first gospel to write and he wrote a good 40 to 50 years after

1128
01:03:45.821 --> 01:03:48.610
Jesus had passed away.
Matthew and Luke copied from mark,

1129
01:03:48.611 --> 01:03:50.830
but use their own respective external sources.

1130
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:53.200
70 years after Jesus had passed away.

1131
01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:57.490
And John wrote his Gospel 100 years after the death of Jesus.
So,
you know,

1132
01:03:57.491 --> 01:04:01.930
these stories where campfire stories passed down.
And,
and when you,

1133
01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:05.510
it's interesting,
one of my books,
Jesus Lord,
he was only human.
I take,

1134
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.880
I take the New Testament and normally when you read the New Testament,

1135
01:04:09.881 --> 01:04:11.800
you'll rate,
you know,
uh,
Matthew,
you know,

1136
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.590
you've read mark and then you read Matthew and then you read Luke in need,
John.

1137
01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:18.190
And if you hear what each of the gospels has to write about each of the key

1138
01:04:18.191 --> 01:04:22.030
moments in Jesus' life,
wherever it's his birth,
his baptism,
you know,

1139
01:04:22.031 --> 01:04:27.010
his ministry,
his trial,
he's execution.
That kind of sound almost the same.

1140
01:04:27.011 --> 01:04:29.500
But if you just focus on one story in Matthew,

1141
01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.030
let's say it's his baptism and in one story and then on baptism and Luke and

1142
01:04:34.031 --> 01:04:38.350
then baptism mark and so forth,
you see how wildly they stories differ.

1143
01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:39.780
Um,
I,
you know,

1144
01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:43.840
which almost have no resemblance at all when it comes to the facts and uh,

1145
01:04:43.841 --> 01:04:44.674
and so forth.

1146
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.450
<v 0>Not only that,
that's a long fucking time ago.</v>

1147
01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:53.440
The idea that you're going to take anything from 2000 years ago and it's going

1148
01:04:53.441 --> 01:04:58.441
to make any sense whatsoever in 2014 this piecing it together,

1149
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.500
the idea that that's the foundation of the very structure of your society.

1150
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:08.220
That's the foundation of your,
your ideology.

1151
01:05:08.221 --> 01:05:09.900
That's the foundation of your morals.

1152
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:15.110
It's all based on this 2000 plus year old garbled shit and not based on what we

1153
01:05:15.841 --> 01:05:18.880
know today,
the experiences that we have today,

1154
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
what we know today about values and ethics and communication and the blow back

1155
01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:25.660
of negative behavior,

1156
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:29.800
that we're not trying to formulate our own new guidelines for life.

1157
01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:35.070
That we're all basing this on Doni clams and don't get tattooed and don't fuck

1158
01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:38.830
guys like all this crazy shit that's old as fuck.

1159
01:05:38.831 --> 01:05:42.100
And it was based on nonsense.
You know,
it's,
it's,
it's,

1160
01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:45.310
it's quite amazing the hold that it has today.

1161
01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:50.340
And I think one of the best examples of one of the major problems that we have

1162
01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:54.100
as a culture and that's our fear,
our fear,

1163
01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:59.470
our fear of the unknown or fear of death.
Our fear of,
you know,

1164
01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.170
we're not living our lives the wrong way.

1165
01:06:02.171 --> 01:06:05.770
So if we have one particular ideology that we follow,

1166
01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:10.800
anybody that follows and another ideology is immediately attacked and that goes

1167
01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:12.940
for the people that are religious.

1168
01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:15.730
Also it goes to the people that are on the left,

1169
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:19.720
that attack without doubt.
Anything that's on the right,

1170
01:06:19.721 --> 01:06:21.820
it goes for the people that are on the right,
that attack,

1171
01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.780
anything that's on the left.

1172
01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:25.810
It goes for fucking Yankees fans that hate the Dodgers.

1173
01:06:25.811 --> 01:06:29.200
It goes for people who like Max and you know,

1174
01:06:29.201 --> 01:06:33.310
those fucking PC guys are assholes.
Like we're weird with that.
We don't,

1175
01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:37.650
we want our choice to be the correct choice in our life.

1176
01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:40.600
<v 3>Exactly.
And,
and,
and America is now in Paul's,</v>

1177
01:06:40.601 --> 01:06:44.560
we'll show it us America is more polarized today than it was on the eve of the

1178
01:06:44.561 --> 01:06:49.210
civil war.
And whilst it's 20 weeks,
yeah,
well,
it's 20 or 30 years ago,

1179
01:06:49.211 --> 01:06:51.820
we kind of all go down news from the same source.
You know,

1180
01:06:51.821 --> 01:06:55.240
there was a CNN or wherever.
Now that,
you know,

1181
01:06:55.241 --> 01:06:58.660
liberal camp and the conservative camp get their news from the,
uh,

1182
01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.550
their own camps.
It becomes an endless,

1183
01:07:00.810 --> 01:07:05.020
a feedback loop of confirmation bias and,
uh,
you know,

1184
01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:08.170
opposing thoughts and opposing opinions are taken into consideration.

1185
01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:10.600
And that's why,
you know,
there's political parties now,

1186
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:13.720
more so on the republican side.
And more party of this tea party side.

1187
01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.690
They've become a cult.
They demand ideological purity.

1188
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:20.470
And if you're not ideological,
pure,
I mean Eric cancel the,
you know,

1189
01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:24.190
the majority a representative in the house,
uh,

1190
01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:26.290
was thrown out for not being conservative enough.

1191
01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:28.840
Eric Cantona all being conservative enough.

1192
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:32.980
What was it that it wasn't being conservative enough on immigration was the big

1193
01:07:32.981 --> 01:07:37.020
thing.
But you know,
I think Virginia is board is there,
we'll secure it

1194
01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:44.260
from Mexico.
Why are you going to Virginia?
What is so attractive?
Yeah,
we,

1195
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:46.480
we needed a bigger build a war in the South Virginia.

1196
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:51.430
I like girls with that certain accent.
Yeah,
we'll build a wall around Virginia.

1197
01:07:51.431 --> 01:07:53.280
That's hilarious.
Well,
the immigration Grayson

1198
01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:58.080
<v 0>thing is one of the best examples of how this country is fucking crazy and</v>

1199
01:07:58.081 --> 01:08:02.010
insane.
It's because it's a country that was founded by immigrants.

1200
01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:05.490
So this idea that we're going to keep all the immigrants out of a country that

1201
01:08:05.491 --> 01:08:08.430
was founded by immigrants is holy shit crazy.

1202
01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:12.900
I mean that is not only that it's evil and you got a bunch of people that are

1203
01:08:12.901 --> 01:08:14.430
living below you in the,

1204
01:08:14.431 --> 01:08:18.770
in the south that are in a third world country that's connected.
Like it's an,

1205
01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.980
it's a,
it's an artificial boundary created by man.

1206
01:08:21.981 --> 01:08:24.140
It's not like it's across an ocean.

1207
01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:27.020
Like you have to get an a plane to get to Australia.
Like that's,

1208
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:31.280
that's separate from America and you guys are closer to us than Mexico.

1209
01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:34.400
We're more concerned with the Australians and we are with the Mexicans.

1210
01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:38.120
I mean Mexicans are involved in some brutal fucking drug wars.

1211
01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:41.480
They have terrible crime.
They have terrible corruption.

1212
01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:46.130
The Mexico City is one of the most polluted cities on the planet as far as air

1213
01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:46.850
pollution.

1214
01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:50.720
It's terrifying that this is all right next to us and these people are trying to

1215
01:08:50.721 --> 01:08:54.260
flee to get out of this,
to get a better life.
And we were like,
fuck you.

1216
01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:56.510
This is America.
You can't even come over here.

1217
01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:01.130
<v 3>I know.
I like how irony is lost on the ride.
I was watching a Sean Hannity,
uh,</v>

1218
01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:05.430
pace I need.
He's talking about his immigration crisis.
And,
um,

1219
01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:09.210
and he's got a headline to his piece was,
um,
uh,

1220
01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:12.180
trouble in the heartland or a defending the hot story.

1221
01:09:12.181 --> 01:09:15.390
It was defending the heartland and the graphic he had for defending the

1222
01:09:15.391 --> 01:09:16.950
heartland was the statue of liberty,

1223
01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:22.650
which was a gift from France and promote,
see migration.

1224
01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:26.050
Hilarious you nose.

1225
01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:28.760
<v 0>That is hilarious.
And well,
what does the,
the,
the,
the,</v>

1226
01:09:28.761 --> 01:09:31.020
what's the writing on the statue of Liberty

1227
01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.020
<v 3>that send us your poor,
your huddled masses,
yearning to breathe free.</v>

1228
01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:38.190
And what did the lack of,
uh,
you know,

1229
01:09:38.191 --> 01:09:42.420
what gets me is the lack of introspection on naval gazing when it comes to the

1230
01:09:42.421 --> 01:09:46.110
ses.
It's our policies which have caused,

1231
01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:50.100
these are refugees.
They are not immigrants.
He's a refugees fleeing var,

1232
01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:54.450
intolerable violence circumstances inflicted upon by policies.

1233
01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:59.480
Not only al draconian drug lords,
a drug wars rather,
but also,
you know,

1234
01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:02.850
a free trade.
Nafta,
uh,
again,

1235
01:10:02.851 --> 01:10:07.240
signed into law by Bill Clinton displayed three to 4 million Mexican farm is a

1236
01:10:07.241 --> 01:10:11.160
learn by sent by allowing American agribusiness to go down there,
build up.

1237
01:10:11.161 --> 01:10:13.920
They're monsters,
they're monstrosity.
And you know,
uh,
uh,

1238
01:10:13.921 --> 01:10:16.260
industrial farming complexes,

1239
01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:21.120
Alto over supply the market because of economy of scales with cheap food and

1240
01:10:21.121 --> 01:10:24.150
cheap fruit and projects,
sends these Mexicans off their farms,

1241
01:10:24.151 --> 01:10:28.110
sentiments to the urban areas and then the only profitable businesses drug

1242
01:10:28.111 --> 01:10:32.010
running.
And then we've America's appetite for drugs like cocaine,

1243
01:10:32.011 --> 01:10:34.980
which come from South America or at,
you know,
at a historical low.

1244
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:38.400
They're fighting over and form a smaller and smaller bit of market share.

1245
01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.000
And that's why they become more violent and more tolerable,
more violent,

1246
01:10:42.001 --> 01:10:45.690
trying to defend their smaller market share and turf in these places.

1247
01:10:45.691 --> 01:10:48.300
So we've created the circumstances down there.

1248
01:10:48.301 --> 01:10:52.470
And anyone who says we shouldn't take a kid who travels that far through the

1249
01:10:52.471 --> 01:10:55.890
desert on their own,
they're the people you want.
I mean,

1250
01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.920
and we're not talking big numbers,
we're talking 40,000.

1251
01:10:59.190 --> 01:11:01.260
We've got a population of 350 million.

1252
01:11:01.261 --> 01:11:03.780
If we can't take 40,000 kids who bust their not,

1253
01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:09.000
they get across this in inhospitable terrain to make it in this country.

1254
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:14.020
Uh,
give me them any diver,
somebody you know,
somewhat confederate and Dave.
Yeah,

1255
01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:18.740
<v 0>we know we're going to take America back.
South's going to rise again.</v>

1256
01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:23.880
South's going to rise again.
It's amazing too that they,
you know,

1257
01:11:23.881 --> 01:11:27.000
that confederate flag thing,
that's a fascinating one.

1258
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:31.440
The confederate flag was representative of so many things to them and you know,

1259
01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:34.380
pride,
southern pride and all the,
all these different things.

1260
01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:36.480
You maybe you guys should come up with a new flag,

1261
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:40.130
like maybe come up with one that doesn't have a swastika on it,
you know,

1262
01:11:40.131 --> 01:11:43.020
cause that's essentially what it's like for black people because that's what I

1263
01:11:43.021 --> 01:11:46.100
like it so much.
But could you imagine driving around with your,
uh,
you know,
if,

1264
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:48.120
if somehow or another,
you know,

1265
01:11:48.150 --> 01:11:50.610
you find yourself in the deep south and you're a black person,

1266
01:11:50.611 --> 01:11:52.680
you drive it around and you see these rebel flags everywhere,

1267
01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:56.790
you would think of that a lot.
Like a Jew would look at a swastika.

1268
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.510
I understand that the swastika meant a lot more than that.

1269
01:12:00.511 --> 01:12:04.170
And at one point in time it was actually like a symbol of prosperity and like

1270
01:12:04.171 --> 01:12:08.010
this national pride.
I mean,
the swastika at one point in time was like,
it wasn't,

1271
01:12:08.011 --> 01:12:11.670
it was like this ancient symbol.
Um,
maybe it was reversed,

1272
01:12:11.671 --> 01:12:15.630
but it was used as stone from the hinges.
Yeah.
And certain types of martial arts.

1273
01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:19.740
It was like old versions of karate.
They had the swastika.
Yeah.

1274
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:24.620
There's a Hindu temple that's near my house that,
um,

1275
01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:28.380
uh,
visited and they have a big sign up explaining why they're swastika

1276
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:33.160
<v 3>cause everywhere.
Yeah.
Well we lived in Bali,
Indonesia for a decade.
And,
uh,</v>

1277
01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:37.060
when you drive around bylines,
Haley's Hindu temples everywhere,
but the swastika,

1278
01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:40.930
but it's actually in reverse,
you know,
and,
uh,
but yeah,

1279
01:12:40.931 --> 01:12:44.630
I mean everything is,
you know,
mythologies are always borrowed and ideologies,

1280
01:12:45.010 --> 01:12:48.170
ideologies always borrowed from elsewhere and,
and uh,

1281
01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:52.400
<v 0>yeah,
it's fascinating that they cling to that God damn flag.</v>

1282
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:57.470
I get you like being from the south.
That's cool.
Well,
but the southwest,

1283
01:12:57.570 --> 01:12:59.790
<v 3>the SAF has never gotten over losing the civil war.</v>

1284
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:05.520
They never had a worse runners up in,
you know,
in the history of sports,
you know,

1285
01:13:05.521 --> 01:13:09.900
and they'll never get our,
if you look at the Republican Party today,
uh,
you know,

1286
01:13:10.050 --> 01:13:12.810
most because the Republican party is so monolithic,

1287
01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:17.010
such as a monolithic control herself that affords their Po,

1288
01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:20.640
this southern representation Republican party than most senior positions.

1289
01:13:20.641 --> 01:13:24.910
You know,
Eric Cantor's from Virginia,
you know,
Marco Rubio,
uh,
you know,
you,

1290
01:13:24.911 --> 01:13:29.100
you Mitch Mcconnell,
you go down the line,
they're all southerners and uh,

1291
01:13:29.490 --> 01:13:30.670
you know,
the,
you know,

1292
01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:35.670
the whole policy of blocking Obama is built around obstruction nullification

1293
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.570
and,
um,
and you know,
and,
and that drives the,
you know,
the thrust and Parry of,

1294
01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.080
of who they are as far as the reactionary party.

1295
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:46.450
<v 0>It's also something that unites them,
you know,
unites them in this,</v>

1296
01:13:46.451 --> 01:13:51.020
this group that they have,
you know,
we'll southern pride,
I'm a southern boy.

1297
01:13:51.021 --> 01:13:54.950
You just have the boy.
I'm a southern boy as well.
You know,
this,
this,
this group,

1298
01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.290
this is their own version of skull and bones.

1299
01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.290
<v 3>Yeah.
And when I say tech or country back,
well,
well to where,</v>

1300
01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.900
and I'll leave a say a to the pre civil war days,

1301
01:14:02.901 --> 01:14:04.220
but they won't say that in public,

1302
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:08.090
but then what they want to take America back to is the fifties that's their idea

1303
01:14:08.091 --> 01:14:12.010
of the ideal America.
But that was the era of big federal government,
the FDRS

1304
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.270
<v 2>new deal and so forth.</v>

1305
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:16.870
So and that's when they had it good when liberalism was on the march in America.

1306
01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.030
<v 0>It's something that people always do though,</v>

1307
01:14:19.031 --> 01:14:21.730
don't they always like long for some day,

1308
01:14:21.731 --> 01:14:25.960
long time ago when things made sense,
you know they long strategy,

1309
01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:31.150
they have this nostalgia for the archaic.
It's just,
it's very common,
right.

1310
01:14:31.530 --> 01:14:36.100
And oftentimes like ridiculously so like I used to date this girl,

1311
01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:39.700
she's talking about like high school about this amazing like high school was

1312
01:14:39.701 --> 01:14:43.900
amazing.
We were all young and free and like pitch you had zits,

1313
01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:49.140
everybody was mad at everybody like come on you tell me 50 go figure bank

1314
01:14:50.850 --> 01:14:54.460
about it.
He didn't have bells back then.
Boston been awesome.
Come on.

1315
01:14:54.461 --> 01:14:58.270
You were living with your mom like fucking socked.
Get outta here.

1316
01:14:58.271 --> 01:15:01.350
Like you can't think like that.
Like enjoy this moment.
This,

1317
01:15:01.351 --> 01:15:04.720
this moment is the best moment human beings have ever achieved.

1318
01:15:04.721 --> 01:15:07.660
I believe right now this is the greatest time to be alive.

1319
01:15:07.810 --> 01:15:09.010
The world has ever known.
Yeah,

1320
01:15:09.011 --> 01:15:13.360
it's fraught with peril and all fucked up and economically completely out of

1321
01:15:13.361 --> 01:15:17.710
whack.
But I still think this is the best time ever because information is being

1322
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:22.480
exchanged at a freer pace.
It's being exchanged at a faster pace.

1323
01:15:22.481 --> 01:15:25.930
It's being exchanged amongst people that have never been able to communicate

1324
01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:27.940
before by translation software,

1325
01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:31.990
by just the fact that you have this internet that's allowing people to send

1326
01:15:31.991 --> 01:15:36.550
messages and exchange information and ideas and communicate back and forth and

1327
01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:41.080
influence each other in a way that's never been available before to anyone ever

1328
01:15:41.081 --> 01:15:42.280
in the history of the human race.

1329
01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:45.850
And if there's one thing that has separated us from the other animals in the

1330
01:15:45.851 --> 01:15:48.280
world,
it's our ability to communicate with each other.
Well,

1331
01:15:48.281 --> 01:15:51.400
our communicate or ability to communicate has never been better than it is right

1332
01:15:51.401 --> 01:15:52.930
now.
And I think this also,

1333
01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:58.380
there's a change that I've seen in my lifetime where people are moving towards

1334
01:15:58.691 --> 01:16:00.340
more progressive ideas.

1335
01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:03.430
I think a lot of this resistance that you're getting from this conservative

1336
01:16:03.431 --> 01:16:05.170
party is this,
this,
you know,

1337
01:16:05.171 --> 01:16:08.770
battening down the hatches and trying to avoid this inevitable change.

1338
01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.770
And I think this change,
a lot of it comes from that,

1339
01:16:11.890 --> 01:16:16.090
from this exchange of information,
from understanding each other better.

1340
01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:18.600
<v 2>Well,
I think we're seeing the death throes of,
uh,</v>

1341
01:16:18.601 --> 01:16:21.690
of that white minority politics in America and as,

1342
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:24.960
and what we're going to see more dangerously as America.
You know,

1343
01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:27.940
it's the Browning of America by the year 2050.
Yeah.

1344
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:31.000
25th fear of a black planet is,
how would you say,

1345
01:16:31.890 --> 01:16:36.600
talking to Chuck d type Shit here,
man.
Browning brow.
You allowed to say browning.

1346
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:41.850
You can't say colored people,
but you want to say brownies,
brownies,

1347
01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:46.830
Browning.
Why is it Brownie bad?
But blacks.
No,
that's not very fancy.
Blacks.

1348
01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:51.510
You don't notice that blacks,
you can say black people being Australian.

1349
01:16:51.511 --> 01:16:56.400
I don't know what I'm allowed to say.
I don't know either changes all the time,

1350
01:16:56.650 --> 01:16:59.960
but the Browning of America by 2050.
Yeah.
You know,

1351
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.750
whites bid on minority in this country in 2012 actually that was the first year

1352
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:07.560
we're what bump white babies were the less number,
you know,

1353
01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.980
we're outnumbered by and Brown

1354
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.290
<v 3>babies.
So as we become,
um,
Brown,
uh,</v>

1355
01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:15.230
this white minority politic,

1356
01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.780
this reactionary movement is going to become more aggressive,

1357
01:17:17.781 --> 01:17:21.800
more frustrated because I don't feel like they have representation and we're

1358
01:17:21.801 --> 01:17:24.950
terrorism starts terrorism is a,

1359
01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:29.380
is a reaction written every response to political weakness or political,

1360
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:34.220
political,
uh,
impotency.
And we saw the shoot is in Las Vegas.

1361
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:37.790
Those two white extremists who shot those two police officers in a Walmart

1362
01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:42.180
worker.
If you read their manifesto,
that's what the tea party manifesto.

1363
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:48.500
Yeah.
Four weeks ago,
six weeks ago,
they walked into a,
uh,
a pizzeria shot,

1364
01:17:48.501 --> 01:17:51.450
two cops to death in Vegas in Vegas.
They had their,

1365
01:17:51.451 --> 01:17:55.820
a Batman and Robin Mass on and then they shot themselves about this one.
Yeah.

1366
01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:59.660
Really?
Yeah.
No,
it's,
it was,
it was national news.
It was too many of those guys.

1367
01:17:59.661 --> 01:18:02.600
They watching too much or that a wrestling stuff.
That's what it is.

1368
01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:07.420
Too much of that wrestling stuff.
I didn't even hear about that one,

1369
01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:12.140
but what was their manifesto?
The manifesto was,
uh,
basically that,
uh,
you know,
uh,

1370
01:18:12.170 --> 01:18:14.750
you know,
watts,
they're losing what Christians are losing.

1371
01:18:14.751 --> 01:18:17.660
Representation of America had been taken over by Brown liberals,

1372
01:18:17.661 --> 01:18:19.870
progressive feminists and so forth.

1373
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:23.120
We're going to dress like Batman and white folks.
Yeah,

1374
01:18:23.121 --> 01:18:26.510
we're going to take it out on cops and a Walmart worker and ended up shooting

1375
01:18:26.511 --> 01:18:29.750
themselves.
But we're going to see more and more.
They senior and it actually,

1376
01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:31.490
New York Times had a great piece on it.

1377
01:18:31.491 --> 01:18:35.930
The rise of height or the doubt of height and the explosion of right wing

1378
01:18:35.931 --> 01:18:38.210
militia groups in this country is threatening.

1379
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:42.830
And the more they feel that they are the minority and the more they start losing

1380
01:18:42.831 --> 01:18:43.664
national elections,

1381
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:46.820
let's fights at the Republican party is not going to win a presidential election

1382
01:18:46.821 --> 01:18:51.710
for the next 20 years in every,
in every demographic where,
um,

1383
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:56.480
a demo,
every Democrat,
every demographic in America,
the Democrats are getting,

1384
01:18:56.481 --> 01:18:59.540
gaining market share in every demographic in America,

1385
01:18:59.541 --> 01:19:03.020
which is shrinking the Republican's a group gaining market share so they're not

1386
01:19:03.021 --> 01:19:03.960
going win president Lincoln's.

1387
01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:07.510
And that's why the focus on gerrymandering is districts voter suppression.
It's,

1388
01:19:07.511 --> 01:19:12.020
they're trying to win at the state level,
but now so benefit other than socially.

1389
01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:15.560
I do believe there's a social benefit to having liberals and office.

1390
01:19:15.561 --> 01:19:19.160
I do believe that the one thing that I think that Obama has done,

1391
01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.380
I think there's,
there's a social benefit to having a guy like that in,
in office.

1392
01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:28.010
Well,
there there's a social benefit as long.
Well,
look,
um,

1393
01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:31.650
I'm critical of Obama because he's governed like a Clinton.
He's a,

1394
01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:34.550
he hasn't governed as a liberal little name liberal policy.

1395
01:19:34.551 --> 01:19:36.430
He's implemented Abom macair.

1396
01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:41.030
That was a far from a liberal policy liberal policy when they had unilateral

1397
01:19:41.031 --> 01:19:44.140
control of the Senate and Congress should have been universal healthcare,

1398
01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:47.420
but he didn't even fought for universal healthcare even though he campaigned for

1399
01:19:47.421 --> 01:19:52.190
it.
I would argue we haven't had a liberal president since Nixon and it wasn't in

1400
01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:56.240
Nixon,
wasn't,
didn't implement liberal policies because he was liberal.

1401
01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:58.940
O'Hara had a conscience or was moral.

1402
01:19:59.330 --> 01:20:02.990
He was the last you as president to be scared by liberals and is,

1403
01:20:02.991 --> 01:20:05.200
it does a great story with Nixon when he's in at the,

1404
01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:09.180
at the heart of the antiwar movement and is in the Oval Office and he has Harry

1405
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:12.540
Henry Kissinger standing next to him and it's on the Nixon types and he turns to

1406
01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:13.740
Henry Kissinger and it says,

1407
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:17.580
and all in all the white houses lined up with all these yellow buses of all the

1408
01:20:17.581 --> 01:20:22.260
antiwar protesters and Nixon turns a kiss.
Insurance says,
holy fuck man,

1409
01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:25.410
they really gonna storm the White House and take me drag,
drag me out this.

1410
01:20:25.411 --> 01:20:28.080
He really believed that.
And that's what you want.

1411
01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:31.620
The white has to feel like you want the White House to feel like they're afraid

1412
01:20:31.621 --> 01:20:32.820
of the people you want.

1413
01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:35.820
Politics and politicians in Washington feel like they were afraid.

1414
01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:39.210
And the problem is they're not afraid of the liberal classical liberal class is

1415
01:20:39.211 --> 01:20:42.960
dead.
And the underscore that point is the popularity of Hillary Clinton.

1416
01:20:42.961 --> 01:20:45.060
Hillary Clinton is just a bland,
she's standing brand,

1417
01:20:45.061 --> 01:20:47.700
she stands for nothing in two and,
and our white,

1418
01:20:47.701 --> 01:20:50.340
she ran on no platform over than she was Hillary Clinton.

1419
01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:53.460
She's gonna run on the same platform because they believe they're not going to

1420
01:20:53.461 --> 01:20:57.360
be against a once in a lifetime candidate like the hat and Barack Obama.

1421
01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:00.270
So she's not going to stand for progressive liberalism,
liberalism,

1422
01:21:00.271 --> 01:21:02.100
there is no such thing in liberalism in America.

1423
01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:04.000
There is no one fighting for universal healthcare.

1424
01:21:04.050 --> 01:21:07.050
There's no one fighting for free education or anything like that,

1425
01:21:07.051 --> 01:21:10.680
or higher taxes on corporations and the rich,
I mean this is,
you know,

1426
01:21:10.681 --> 01:21:13.110
we live in an area where conservative politics trumps.

1427
01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:16.570
<v 0>Is there also a bottleneck in the two party system,</v>

1428
01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.840
which is essentially what we have.
I mean,

1429
01:21:18.850 --> 01:21:20.770
you could say that there's a Green party.

1430
01:21:20.771 --> 01:21:23.050
You could say that there's a libertarian party all you want,

1431
01:21:23.051 --> 01:21:25.900
but the reality is they don't get included into the debates.

1432
01:21:25.901 --> 01:21:30.490
As soon as the debates get heavy.
I mean what they did to marginalize Ron Paul,

1433
01:21:30.491 --> 01:21:34.480
who was a Republican,
shows you what they do to anybody who doesn't play ball.

1434
01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:35.441
I mean what you saw,

1435
01:21:35.441 --> 01:21:39.880
like you would see him placing and polls like second and third and they would

1436
01:21:39.881 --> 01:21:42.640
ignore him and concentrate on who was fourth and fifth.

1437
01:21:42.670 --> 01:21:46.900
I mean that was what they did in the media to marginalize that guy effectively

1438
01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:50.200
to do so.
What isn't that the bottleneck?

1439
01:21:50.230 --> 01:21:53.470
The bottleneck is that corporations are sponsoring these people.

1440
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:56.950
Corporations are sponsoring their campaigns,
paying for their campaigns,

1441
01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:58.960
massive donations,

1442
01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.780
and then they have this agenda once they get into place and to,

1443
01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:06.790
to to help these corporations that paid for them to get in there in the first

1444
01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:07.690
place.
That is that.

1445
01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:10.260
<v 3>That's the problem.
You've hit the nail on the head and the problem is,</v>

1446
01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:13.130
I didn't say the problem is being the two party system.
I mean,

1447
01:22:13.131 --> 01:22:15.600
in most Western democracies you have a two party system,

1448
01:22:15.601 --> 01:22:19.200
Australia or the UK and so forth.
The problem is,
but in,

1449
01:22:19.201 --> 01:22:23.040
in Australia and UK,
you have public financing of elections.

1450
01:22:23.041 --> 01:22:27.600
Here it's the opposite.
So,
uh,
our voices don't get heard.

1451
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:28.441
We don't,
you know,

1452
01:22:28.441 --> 01:22:31.440
politicians don't come out to visit you and I to come and visit and do these

1453
01:22:31.441 --> 01:22:35.550
$40,000 per plate dinners.
And they listened to the 50 odd thousand lobbyists,

1454
01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:39.390
which in Washington and in paying their campaign finance.
So you know what?

1455
01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:44.310
There was 32,000 only a mere 32,000 donors in the,
in the,

1456
01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:49.520
in the 12th 2012 elections represented more than 99% of all political donations

1457
01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:51.750
in that campaign cycle.

1458
01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:55.860
So 0.01% of the population is done.

1459
01:22:55.861 --> 01:22:59.760
Only 99% of the campaign finance studies,
two political parties.

1460
01:22:59.970 --> 01:23:01.200
Until you get rid of that,

1461
01:23:01.650 --> 01:23:04.500
you're going to have two political parties which represent the interest of

1462
01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:06.910
corporations and none of the working or the middle class.

1463
01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:10.420
<v 0>Those numbers are crazy.
And stop and think about that.
I mean,</v>

1464
01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:15.310
everybody's fixated on the 1% in this country.
The 1% a 0.01%.

1465
01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:20.380
That's madness.
That's madness.
All the money's coming from them.
Yup.

1466
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:24.610
<v 3>That's it.
I mean,
so our $50 donation,
who gives a fuck?</v>

1467
01:23:24.690 --> 01:23:29.070
<v 0>Is there anybody that you see on the horizon?
Is there any movement,</v>

1468
01:23:29.150 --> 01:23:33.420
any humans that you see that are really trying to implement some sort of a

1469
01:23:33.421 --> 01:23:34.890
change that you think you have a chance

1470
01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:38.370
<v 3>to?
Uh,
well,
t two,
but only one has a chance.</v>

1471
01:23:38.371 --> 01:23:42.740
Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders is if Elizabeth Warren wins a SRO.

1472
01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:47.460
If Elizabeth Warren runs,
she Bates Hillary now,
and I'll,
and I'll tell you why,

1473
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:52.020
uh,
in Oh eight,
if it was a referendum on our rock,

1474
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:56.100
Hillary Clinton,
the only rate if Hillary Clinton had not voted for a rock,

1475
01:23:56.101 --> 01:23:58.380
she would have been a nomination,
would be the president.
Right now,

1476
01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:03.560
the referendum in the Democratic primary selection in this cycle will be income

1477
01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.010
inequality on that.

1478
01:24:05.011 --> 01:24:09.450
She will lose to Elizabeth Warren because if had associations to Wall Street,

1479
01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:13.650
um,
her husband's record and not being a progressive,

1480
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:16.140
Elizabeth Warren is a champion for the middle class,

1481
01:24:16.141 --> 01:24:19.200
a champion for working class.
She wants to dismantle Wall Street.

1482
01:24:19.201 --> 01:24:22.650
She wants to dismantle these financial debt products,

1483
01:24:22.651 --> 01:24:26.330
which have wrecked havoc on the American population and haven't been.

1484
01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:29.040
These laws and regulations haven't been changed since we had the crash in

1485
01:24:29.041 --> 01:24:29.760
[inaudible] eight.

1486
01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.610
We now stand on the precipice of repeating what happened on our weight.

1487
01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:36.930
Nothing has changed and she wants to fight for these causes,
which will,
uh,

1488
01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:40.890
you know,
uh,
and the rigging of the game,
so to speak.
Bernie Sanders,

1489
01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.920
I like him as well,
but he has no chance in a national electorate.

1490
01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:46.920
Elizabeth Warren could win the day and see nomination also become president.

1491
01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.660
<v 0>Why does Bernie Sanders have no chance?
And how do you think a woman's group</v>

1492
01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:53.670
<v 3>be president?
Well,
because,
uh,
Sam,
the number one,</v>

1493
01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:58.530
the Democrats yearn for a historic candidate at woman.
So they tried to,

1494
01:24:58.531 --> 01:25:02.580
black guy didn't work out so well,
let's go with a check.
Yeah.
So we want to,

1495
01:25:02.581 --> 01:25:05.400
not a piece of history,
you know,
a historic moment.

1496
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:08.430
All the white men are all fucking around their wives and shit.

1497
01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:12.700
I want to catch those bitches as soon as they run for president.
Well,

1498
01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:17.670
they're all,
they're all wiener in.
Yeah.
And Sandy as well.
San Does his,

1499
01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:22.410
uh,
too much of an open shirted socialist.
Uh,
identify as a socialist and sorry,

1500
01:25:22.770 --> 01:25:26.530
uh,
I think the media and the Republican Party will be,

1501
01:25:26.770 --> 01:25:30.010
it'd be too easy for them to slay him with the s word.

1502
01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:33.790
Whereas a Elizabeth Warren has never mentioned the s word and it's more of a

1503
01:25:33.791 --> 01:25:36.700
populous a than a,
than a socialist.

1504
01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:40.640
<v 0>Yes.
Word.
The s word.
Is that unsurmountable mean?</v>

1505
01:25:40.641 --> 01:25:44.180
Is it possible that what you were talking about before that if you look at

1506
01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:48.920
what's happening in Europe and you look at the benefits of socialism as far as

1507
01:25:48.921 --> 01:25:53.150
Canada and some other countries,
Australia socialized medicine,

1508
01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.650
socialized education,

1509
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:59.780
is it possible that that can be discussed in some sort of a way that's not going

1510
01:25:59.781 --> 01:26:02.330
to need jerk turn people off in America?

1511
01:26:02.630 --> 01:26:04.250
<v 3>Well,
the is,
you have a failed</v>

1512
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:08.750
<v 0>media class because the media class weren't report the facts.
Uh,</v>

1513
01:26:08.751 --> 01:26:11.390
the media class,
you know,
are Republican,

1514
01:26:11.391 --> 01:26:15.140
gets on TV and says there's no such thing as gravity.
Then CNN says,
well,

1515
01:26:15.141 --> 01:26:18.680
we need to get a Democrat to speak to an Democrat.
It says a gravity Israel.

1516
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:22.630
CNN says,
look,
Democrats and Republicans are fighting again.
You know,

1517
01:26:22.670 --> 01:26:26.690
so you'll never have an honest fact bags argument and you'll never have the

1518
01:26:26.691 --> 01:26:30.830
facts which you discussed.
Social democracies work,
Germany and,

1519
01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:34.600
and his western European countries have far less social and uh,
you know,
um,
uh,

1520
01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:36.080
income inequality than we do.

1521
01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:40.370
They also have happier people and we do on the world happiness index,

1522
01:26:40.371 --> 01:26:43.160
the top 15 countries are all social democracies.

1523
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:45.930
American rights is the richest country on the planet,

1524
01:26:45.931 --> 01:26:50.360
a bit rights 17th on the world happiness index.
We were,
we rank behind Mexico,

1525
01:26:50.630 --> 01:26:53.090
so won't be long before they build a wall down there to keep it awesome.

1526
01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:54.760
But that doesn't even make any sense.

1527
01:26:54.761 --> 01:26:56.830
If all the Mexicans are trying to get over here,
but we're happy,

1528
01:26:56.890 --> 01:26:59.020
we're not as happy as them.
That doesn't make any sense.

1529
01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:03.460
What's the world happiness index and how's that even no one's talked to me.

1530
01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:07.940
Nobody interviewed me.
Asked me how I'm not,
you're not buying it.
Happy,
happy.

1531
01:27:08.170 --> 01:27:10.080
I'm a very happy person.
I don't get it.

1532
01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:13.040
<v 3>Yeah.
Well the,
the,
the world happiness index is measured,</v>

1533
01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.600
measured on some metrics such as pollution,
access to healthcare,

1534
01:27:17.610 --> 01:27:22.470
access to education,
gender equality,
income and equality,
uh,
pollution.

1535
01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:25.920
Um,
our crime rates,
teen pregnancy and so forth.

1536
01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:29.940
<v 0>And Mexico is better than a higher,
we rank behind Mexico on the world.</v>

1537
01:27:29.941 --> 01:27:34.180
Having someone is not doing a good job in America because most of the places

1538
01:27:34.181 --> 01:27:37.020
that I see look a lot better than the places in Mexico.
That's,

1539
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:40.030
it doesn't make any sense.
You want,
man,
you've,
we were in woodland hills here.

1540
01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:45.070
Canoga Park.
But I don't think there's any,

1541
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:49.510
I don't think there's any way that you can like qualify like a whole nation like

1542
01:27:49.511 --> 01:27:50.560
that though.
You know what I'm saying?

1543
01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:53.350
Like I don't think there's any way that you can say like,
Hey,

1544
01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:58.020
this is a happier country.
This is that,
you know,
you kind of,

1545
01:27:58.210 --> 01:28:00.910
you start statistic mining in that way.

1546
01:28:00.911 --> 01:28:03.320
Like America's a the least happy the least is.

1547
01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.790
But we're also the most innovative.
We create more things.
We have more art,

1548
01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:10.120
more music,
more pop culture,
more comedy,
more movies.

1549
01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:14.620
So many things come out of America because of this turmoil and this crazy fucked

1550
01:28:14.621 --> 01:28:18.280
up sort of a way we live.
It also lends itself to creativity.

1551
01:28:18.281 --> 01:28:23.010
It lends itself to the distribution of,
of,
of,
of media.
You know,

1552
01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:26.680
we have more shit that comes out of here.
Good or bad.

1553
01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.060
I'm not saying that all of it's great,

1554
01:28:28.061 --> 01:28:31.420
but a lot of influence comes out of this one spot.

1555
01:28:31.530 --> 01:28:34.350
<v 3>Absolutely.
I mean,
you know this,
whenever I speak,</v>

1556
01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:38.320
I try not to come across as the,
uh,
the,
the typical American,
right.

1557
01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:42.310
<v 0>I'm not,
I get,
this is what piers Morgan lost his job.</v>

1558
01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:46.020
All that guy was at shit.
That's why he lost his job.
Such,

1559
01:28:46.150 --> 01:28:47.800
I never got that job in the first place.

1560
01:28:47.801 --> 01:28:51.840
You've been involved in fucking tapping into people's phones,
asshole,

1561
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:55.690
<v 3>too.
True.
I,
I was up in for that so many times and I went to a gay night.
It's,</v>

1562
01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:58.460
but they,
uh,
I look,
I'm like,
I've,

1563
01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.980
I'm obsessed with America and always have been my friends in high school.

1564
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:05.250
<v 2>We had a always criticized me for being a,
want to be American.</v>

1565
01:29:05.251 --> 01:29:08.730
The reason I moved here is because I am in love of America and I and who loves

1566
01:29:08.731 --> 01:29:10.650
him more,
more American,
more than you know,

1567
01:29:10.651 --> 01:29:13.260
an immigrant who wants to come here and help try and make things better.

1568
01:29:13.261 --> 01:29:16.800
I still believe in America,
but we're doing things the wrong way.

1569
01:29:16.801 --> 01:29:19.770
Are you a citizen?
No,
I'm still a resident.
I have the right

1570
01:29:21.490 --> 01:29:26.430
to vote yet.
So if you become,
if you become a citizen,

1571
01:29:26.431 --> 01:29:28.680
you can vote,
but you'll never be able to be president.

1572
01:29:28.710 --> 01:29:33.450
How can we be governor of California?
That's weird.
That's weird.
I'm sorry.

1573
01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:37.860
This idea is based on the notion that someone is going to be well groomed by

1574
01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:42.900
Alcaide do come over here and one of them white skin terrorists and it made

1575
01:29:44.611 --> 01:29:48.120
living in the world's most populous Muslim country for 10 years.

1576
01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:52.830
One and help my resume data when I ran it.
All right.
Jesus Christ,

1577
01:29:52.831 --> 01:29:54.260
you probably don't even know.
You're a commie.

1578
01:29:55.930 --> 01:30:00.000
You over here to fuck up our freedom.
Yeah,
that's it.
Right into bed as Christ.

1579
01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:03.120
You don't even know,
man,
I'm asleep as sale.

1580
01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:07.350
Why is it that America produces so much like as far as creativity,

1581
01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:11.250
so much innovation,
much technological innovation,
so much creativity.

1582
01:30:11.410 --> 01:30:15.490
So many good things come out of this place as well.
I was,
I,
you know,

1583
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:17.860
America's a great country.
I think,
you know,
the,

1584
01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:20.910
the u s has produced I litany of good things.

1585
01:30:20.911 --> 01:30:23.370
Its contribution to the world culturally is,
you know,
uh,

1586
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:28.770
you can't argue against it.
But my point is that,
uh,
at benefits,

1587
01:30:28.771 --> 01:30:31.540
so few,
um,
and if you look at the,

1588
01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:36.210
the new economy and vote economists as far as the technology,
uh,
you know,

1589
01:30:36.211 --> 01:30:39.960
these Facebook,
uh,
producers and these,
these,
you know,
what was that?

1590
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:43.470
WHATSAPP just sold for how many billions of dollars?
$15 billion,

1591
01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:48.150
but they got her in a workforce of like 25 people,
25 people benefit that,

1592
01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:51.390
the sale of that.
So in the things that we're producing now,

1593
01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:54.570
no longer have any social capital.
Um,

1594
01:30:54.571 --> 01:30:58.050
we're not producing great products which can be exported to the world.

1595
01:30:58.051 --> 01:31:02.850
Our technology,
uh,
has been bought out by the military industrial complex.

1596
01:31:02.851 --> 01:31:06.820
Most of the R and D and technological research done in this country country is a

1597
01:31:06.821 --> 01:31:10.410
to the benefit of how it figuring out how we can kill people better,
you know,
in,

1598
01:31:10.411 --> 01:31:15.120
in other kinds of things.
It is how much of it is done an electric cars,

1599
01:31:15.150 --> 01:31:18.450
how much of it is done on electronics and cell phone?
We'll look at,

1600
01:31:18.451 --> 01:31:22.200
look at the electric car and that's a great point.
I mean,
Tesla,
um,
you know,

1601
01:31:22.201 --> 01:31:25.000
he'd say plenty of them around and there's these rich white neighborhoods and

1602
01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:26.550
certainly where I'm from.
And Laguna beach,

1603
01:31:26.551 --> 01:31:29.520
you see a ton of them that a new Toyota,
he fucked up.
I said,
where are you from?

1604
01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:35.070
I never tell people where I'm from and God damn it up.
I said,
Newport page.
No,

1605
01:31:35.071 --> 01:31:39.630
you did.
I fucked up.
I did.
If I can we get it?
Nope.
Too late.

1606
01:31:39.631 --> 01:31:44.310
It's live.
It's live or is this really live?
Yeah,
it's a lot.
Dammit.
Dammit.

1607
01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:48.120
I said my goone of h no you didn't.
You can't deny it.

1608
01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:53.880
It gave up two things.
Canoga Park and Laguna beach.
We're fucked.
I'm like,
God,

1609
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:59.010
I going to be hearing Alpha,
but in the conservative way they uh,
yeah.

1610
01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:02.520
When you look at the opposition Jessica,
I mean if it wasn't for big oil and uh,

1611
01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.790
so we'd,
we'd have the electric car years ago and,

1612
01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:09.670
and Elon Musk has spoken at great length of the opposition he's faced and bring

1613
01:32:09.671 --> 01:32:14.320
any electric car to market.
Um,
so,
uh,
yeah,
we're producing great things,

1614
01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:16.630
but you know,
the corporate totalitarian state,

1615
01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:20.590
big oil and these kinds of interests will always Trump look what's happening.

1616
01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:25.750
Look at all these states have posed Tesla,
you know,
a New Jersey,
for example,

1617
01:32:25.751 --> 01:32:30.430
Wisconsin,
Chris Texas.
You know what,
what is that guy all about?

1618
01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:33.840
Chris Christie is not anymore.

1619
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:37.120
He's getting slim and I'm ready for 2016.

1620
01:32:38.330 --> 01:32:42.050
I'm going to fucking wheel him out there and fodder.
Yeah.

1621
01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:47.250
Do you call those motor a two wheel things guys?
Such a cool,
he's done it.

1622
01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:50.890
He's done of a worry about Christy anymore.
He's,
he's not a candidate.
He's not,

1623
01:32:51.610 --> 01:32:53.590
he's given up,
well he hasn't given up,

1624
01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:56.400
but all the big money has moved away from him cause politically he's dead in the

1625
01:32:56.401 --> 01:32:59.290
water because there's these lawsuits are going to follow him well into their

1626
01:32:59.291 --> 01:33:03.810
2016 election cycle.
But the bridge,
is it just the bridge thing or is it,

1627
01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:05.290
what's the bridge thing?

1628
01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:09.820
But it's the whole culture of a timid intimidation at whole new Josie soprano

1629
01:33:09.821 --> 01:33:14.270
like atmosphere,
which turns off women and independent and minority voters.

1630
01:33:14.271 --> 01:33:19.050
So plus fat.
Yeah,
we mentioned that already.
Yeah.

1631
01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:23.470
Fat Acceptance.
People step aside because you're being silly.

1632
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:26.050
Okay.
I don't accept smokers either.

1633
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:31.300
Smoking acceptance I think is equally stupid.
They're dumb habits.

1634
01:33:31.301 --> 01:33:34.240
So as being morbidly obese,
it's a dumb thing to do.
Well,

1635
01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:37.390
I've got no problem with the morbidly obese if you're poor because the poor in

1636
01:33:37.391 --> 01:33:39.090
this country can't afford to be skinny.

1637
01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:41.050
But if you're a rich and what like Christie is,

1638
01:33:41.051 --> 01:33:44.320
well you have no excuse of being a Fetty [inaudible] that is true to a certain

1639
01:33:44.321 --> 01:33:47.980
extent,
but still it means over eating.
And that that is a personal choice.

1640
01:33:47.981 --> 01:33:50.800
Even if you're poor,
if you're getting bad food,
that's one thing.

1641
01:33:50.801 --> 01:33:52.420
Bad nutrition is another thing.

1642
01:33:52.421 --> 01:33:57.070
But the over abundance of this bad nutrition is just simply gluttony.
Manners.

1643
01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.280
Like if you're a family of four and you're husband and wife on the minimum wage,

1644
01:34:00.281 --> 01:34:03.250
let's call it your netting $400 a week.
You still got to pay rent.

1645
01:34:03.251 --> 01:34:06.740
You still got to pay the car.
You can ever go to,
uh,

1646
01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:11.190
try to jars and buy $15 per of Broccoli and some potatoes,

1647
01:34:11.191 --> 01:34:14.810
or you go to Wendy's and you feed the whole family for four.
You know,
that's a,

1648
01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:16.060
that is fucked.

1649
01:34:16.090 --> 01:34:20.650
But the reason their fat is not because they're barely getting by with that
food.

1650
01:34:20.651 --> 01:34:22.990
It's because they're eating more of it than they need to.
Yeah.

1651
01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:25.780
It sucks that they're getting bad food for sure.

1652
01:34:25.781 --> 01:34:29.950
It sucks that it's so expensive to eat healthy down.
Those are absolutes.

1653
01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:34.870
I am with you.
I'm a fat ass luck.
You are.
I'm a faddish.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1654
01:34:34.871 --> 01:34:38.050
Fat People.
Well,
some of my bed,
I have really good friends that are fat as fuck.

1655
01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:39.910
It's not that I hate,

1656
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:44.530
it's just that there is a certain reality to being morbidly obese and I don't,

1657
01:34:44.531 --> 01:34:46.930
I don't think you're helping people with this idea,

1658
01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:51.300
this notion of fat acceptance and I think this is,
this is the,
the,
the,

1659
01:34:51.330 --> 01:34:55.060
the broad end of the spectrum when it comes to this,

1660
01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:58.460
these new ideas that I think people are becoming more progressive

1661
01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:01.790
<v 0>and more sensitive,
more open minded.
I think there's great things to that,</v>

1662
01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:05.060
but I think there's also things like fat acceptance where it gets to a point

1663
01:35:05.061 --> 01:35:07.850
where like,
listen,
stop.
I couldn't throw,

1664
01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.090
I got in trouble on Twitter a couple of years ago for tweeting.

1665
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:14.660
I'm the Rosa Park of not giving up my seat on the bus for fat people.

1666
01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:20.480
You got in trouble for that.
Why was it on the y?

1667
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:23.210
Was a fat person trying to take your seat on the bus?
Is that,

1668
01:35:23.211 --> 01:35:26.180
what does that really happen?
No,
it didn't really have him say,

1669
01:35:26.190 --> 01:35:30.530
he just gave it up.
You just fucking is being an asshole.

1670
01:35:30.710 --> 01:35:35.030
Listen that,
that feeling of shame,
this idea of fat shaming.

1671
01:35:35.031 --> 01:35:37.160
People don't like that.
But that feeling of shame,

1672
01:35:37.161 --> 01:35:40.460
that negative feeling is a feeling of social failure and that feeling of social

1673
01:35:40.461 --> 01:35:45.230
failure,
that ostracized feeling,
the only benefit of that there's,
it's not,

1674
01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:46.760
you know,
it's not good to be cruel,

1675
01:35:46.761 --> 01:35:50.420
but the only benefit of that to the person who receives it is that it motivate

1676
01:35:50.421 --> 01:35:54.020
them to lose weight.
That's,
that's just a fact.
And fat acceptance.

1677
01:35:54.021 --> 01:35:56.600
That means you're happy the way you are.
You're good the way you are.
No,

1678
01:35:56.601 --> 01:36:01.060
you're going to die quick.
Your fucking heart is pumping through sludge,
right?

1679
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:04.460
You need to eat some vegetables.
You Fuck Jesus Christ.

1680
01:36:04.461 --> 01:36:08.390
You've never messed up out of a Chloe Kardashian cause a cloaker destiny and the

1681
01:36:08.391 --> 01:36:11.780
big one,
but she's barely big.
You know what I mean?
If you talk about,

1682
01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:15.680
that's not fat.
I don't call her fat,
it's going to be a big girl.
But you know,

1683
01:36:15.681 --> 01:36:17.360
there's,
who's that woman who's a,

1684
01:36:17.361 --> 01:36:20.750
the McCarthy girl who's on all those movies now?
No,
no.
Guinea.

1685
01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:25.100
Jenny's the hot one.
Melissa.
Melissa,
cheesy.
Enormous one that everybody loves.

1686
01:36:25.101 --> 01:36:27.920
She's America.
Look at her.
She's all Chubby and everything,

1687
01:36:27.921 --> 01:36:32.770
but all friendly and wacky.
Poor Gal.
She's going to fucking die.
She's,

1688
01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:36.800
her heart is not going to keep beating if you do that.
It's not going to last.

1689
01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:41.660
Those really big fat ones,
they never hit 60.
They just don't,
they never make it.

1690
01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:43.430
Do I have a heart attack and Disneyland oil?

1691
01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.560
Exactly what the Truro and each hand to fist and fucking with one of those hats

1692
01:36:48.561 --> 01:36:52.670
on as soda
or a backpack,

1693
01:36:52.671 --> 01:36:56.270
like one of those Campbell backpacks I afraid of with fucking mountain doing it.

1694
01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:01.430
Yeah.
Look,
there's a lot of bad things to,
uh,
to the American Diet.

1695
01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:03.730
That's for fuck shore and a lot of it is,

1696
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:08.690
do you ever watch the documentary king corn?
No.
God Damn Amazing.

1697
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:14.120
The depth that the corn industry and the corn lobby and the corn,

1698
01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:18.530
there's these people that have grown corn and that this subsidization

1699
01:37:18.570 --> 01:37:22.060
substations at a word subsidizing by the American government.
Yup.

1700
01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:25.670
The corn and corn syrup like this.

1701
01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:29.450
This is how much of this is involved in our food and our everything.

1702
01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:33.170
It's amazing.
It's in our bread.
Yeah.

1703
01:37:33.390 --> 01:37:37.190
They had everyone plays here up in people's fucking sodas and their this and

1704
01:37:37.191 --> 01:37:40.430
their that.
And there was a thing about,
um,
uh,

1705
01:37:40.431 --> 01:37:45.260
it was all lawsuit about Mexico.
I'm trying to force out,

1706
01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:46.190
um,
uh,

1707
01:37:46.190 --> 01:37:49.700
corn syrup because they were trying to force them to use corn syrup and their

1708
01:37:49.701 --> 01:37:53.420
production of Coca Cola.
And so they resisted it and then they were sued.

1709
01:37:53.421 --> 01:37:56.100
And the whole thing is just corn

1710
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.010
<v 2>is a wacky fucking plant man.
Well,
I mean,</v>

1711
01:37:59.050 --> 01:38:02.450
and in fact it's so pervasive because it's no coincidence at all.

1712
01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:06.840
I wear is the first stop on the,
uh,
both parties a nomination process.

1713
01:38:06.841 --> 01:38:10.020
And that's why they spend all the time,
you know.
Yeah.
Isn't that crazy?

1714
01:38:10.021 --> 01:38:14.760
Help it bagging?
No,
no coincidence whatsoever for anybody who wants,
I mean,

1715
01:38:14.761 --> 01:38:16.980
I'm not going to go into depth about it cause we talked about this before,

1716
01:38:16.981 --> 01:38:20.280
but please watch the documentary king corn if you get a chance.

1717
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:24.300
It's fooding cause another good one.
That's a scary one.
That's a scary one.
Yeah,

1718
01:38:24.301 --> 01:38:27.480
that'll,
that'll shy you away from fast food.
I,
you know,

1719
01:38:27.481 --> 01:38:29.400
I've taken a lot of heat about this,
uh,

1720
01:38:29.401 --> 01:38:34.080
this subject of minimum wage by a bunch of people that think that folks who work

1721
01:38:34.081 --> 01:38:38.580
in fast food or for folks who work in entry level jobs should not get paid $15

1722
01:38:38.581 --> 01:38:40.950
an hour.
That's the number that I always throw around.
I like,

1723
01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:43.320
you can't live off of less than 15 bucks an hour,
man.

1724
01:38:43.321 --> 01:38:45.960
You just can't 15 bucks an hour.
You can pay your rent,

1725
01:38:45.961 --> 01:38:47.970
you can get something to eat and it's still not a lot of money.

1726
01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:51.060
And if you run a company that can't afford to pay your workers,

1727
01:38:51.061 --> 01:38:53.490
$15 an hour means you're making too much.

1728
01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.590
Either you personally or making too much money,

1729
01:38:55.591 --> 01:38:58.580
you're not giving the workers enough or some,
something's happening.
You're,

1730
01:38:58.581 --> 01:39:03.030
you're,
you're not profitable.
You need less workers.
You're not,
you're not,
you're,

1731
01:39:03.031 --> 01:39:06.870
your system is not efficient.
There's gotta be some way that you can,
if,

1732
01:39:07.050 --> 01:39:11.970
if someone works for you all day and they get paid less than a survival wage,

1733
01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.330
you essentially have slaves.
Well,
this is what the problem is.
And then,
you know,

1734
01:39:15.630 --> 01:39:17.550
I kept coming back to this point in America,

1735
01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:19.680
we have socialism for the corporations,

1736
01:39:19.681 --> 01:39:23.280
but we have capitalism for the rest of us.
So you take warm out,

1737
01:39:23.281 --> 01:39:24.180
or Bank of America,

1738
01:39:24.181 --> 01:39:27.840
they pay their workers so little that we have to subsidize them with food

1739
01:39:27.841 --> 01:39:32.110
assistance,
housing assistance and so forth.
Every Walmart,
the fall,

1740
01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:35.880
Walmart is on more than the combined 42% bottom,

1741
01:39:35.881 --> 01:39:40.500
40% 2% of Americans yet are allowed to pay their workers so little that the

1742
01:39:40.501 --> 01:39:42.860
average texts pie,
the average wold might employ.

1743
01:39:42.861 --> 01:39:47.040
It costs the average taxpayer in his country,
$1,400 per year in Texas.

1744
01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.440
So you and I,
uh,

1745
01:39:49.441 --> 01:39:54.441
funding the workforce for a ridiculously fucking wealthy bunch of individuals

1746
01:39:54.511 --> 01:39:56.370
that can afford to pay their employees more.

1747
01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:00.660
So that's socialism for that damn capitalism for the rest of us.

1748
01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:02.490
And that's hit me with those numbers.
Again,

1749
01:40:02.670 --> 01:40:07.530
the most wealthy people of Walmart fall and I inherited their wealth.

1750
01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:11.460
They've not,
sorry,
I did not build that motherfucker.
They did not build that.

1751
01:40:11.461 --> 01:40:12.660
I didn't know felt that.

1752
01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:17.930
So the full Walmart is on more than the bottom 42% combined in this country.

1753
01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:23.540
The for Walmart airs for people earn more money per year than the bottom 42% of

1754
01:40:26.191 --> 01:40:30.420
the entire country.
Yup.
And Google it.
I can't,

1755
01:40:31.110 --> 01:40:35.160
I'll throw up on my keyboard.
That's incredible.
Yeah,
that's it.

1756
01:40:35.370 --> 01:40:38.400
So all we have to do is kidnapped the,
for Walmart,

1757
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:40.710
take all of their money,

1758
01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:44.670
we distribute it to the bottom 42% we've essentially cured poverty.

1759
01:40:44.730 --> 01:40:49.620
You and I for people,
that's a new Melissa McCarthy movie.
Melissa McCarthy.

1760
01:40:49.621 --> 01:40:51.330
She fucking gets a mouthful of donuts.

1761
01:40:51.370 --> 01:40:55.090
He gets a good sugar rush and she runs out and kidnaps the wall and she lets

1762
01:40:55.091 --> 01:40:57.890
them see the errors of their ways and they wind up working in a,

1763
01:40:57.990 --> 01:41:01.180
the end of the movie.
They're happy and they're working in like Costa Rica,

1764
01:41:01.181 --> 01:41:05.060
like fucking saving people from hurricanes or some shit.
Yeah,

1765
01:41:05.230 --> 01:41:08.200
that's a crazy.
And we've all at wealth,

1766
01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:12.610
you and I paying for each photo and $100 per year to Walmart to subsidize their

1767
01:41:12.611 --> 01:41:16.270
workforce for people.
That's incredible.
Yup.
Yup.

1768
01:41:16.930 --> 01:41:18.220
That's incredible.
The Cook,

1769
01:41:18.221 --> 01:41:21.160
the cook brothers to combine the two Karch profits on more than that.

1770
01:41:21.161 --> 01:41:25.060
I think it's,
you'll have them Google pets around about the bottom 50% two guys,

1771
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:29.080
I'm more than the bottom 50% okay,
so we got an issue.
We've got six people.

1772
01:41:29.081 --> 01:41:33.310
We kidnapped six people.
We take their money.
You're living at the torturing pat,

1773
01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:37.480
but you would have the torch them.
We just kill him.
But we,
I don't mean that,

1774
01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:42.390
don't put me on a list,
but you,
if those people,
just those people's wells,

1775
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:43.480
so six people,

1776
01:41:43.810 --> 01:41:48.360
you said 50% and 42% but that's not the combine or not combine both vehicles

1777
01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:51.280
separate.
You're going to separate them but equal.

1778
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:53.890
But then how does that work then?
Because that means like if the,

1779
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:55.450
the combined 42%,

1780
01:41:55.451 --> 01:41:59.590
but then you also have the combined 50% you can't add them together,

1781
01:41:59.850 --> 01:42:04.110
get them together because cause he's still working from the same number.
So the,

1782
01:42:04.111 --> 01:42:08.140
the,
the combined wealth of the cock provinces,
uh,
is more than the bottom,

1783
01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:12.410
roughly 50% of the nation,
but the combined wealth of the Walmart heir.

1784
01:42:12.411 --> 01:42:14.980
So you're working from a fixed number.
So he can't,

1785
01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:17.860
if he hadn't buffed to get her,
it's not like,
you know,
the six of them.

1786
01:42:17.861 --> 01:42:19.930
I'm 92% right.

1787
01:42:19.931 --> 01:42:24.520
They don't know 92% but they own double 42% yeah.

1788
01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:29.370
So what does that,
how does it creep it up to 60%?
What does it creep in?

1789
01:42:29.371 --> 01:42:32.410
I think I told you at the beginning of not an economist.
Well I'm,
well,

1790
01:42:32.411 --> 01:42:35.950
I'm dumb as fuck.
So we're screwed.
Not only am I not an economist,

1791
01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:40.240
I'm not good at counting shit.
So if you,
if you think about that though,
just,

1792
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:44.410
just this,
the fact that the four people from Walmart and the two Koch brothers,

1793
01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:47.610
just those six people or what is the total money,
the,

1794
01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.960
the total amount of money that those guys have?
Well,

1795
01:42:49.961 --> 01:42:54.040
the kind of the Koch brothers worth a combined about $55 billion.

1796
01:42:54.850 --> 01:42:58.780
Uh,
and most of the money is on is from a speculation,

1797
01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:03.070
not from hiring people or building stuff.
Most of it is from oil speculation.

1798
01:43:03.490 --> 01:43:08.030
So stock market shit,
which has no social value,
money fuckery and money,

1799
01:43:08.150 --> 01:43:11.050
money fuckery.
And that's really what it is.
Right?
That's what crip Polk.

1800
01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:11.531
Ruben said,

1801
01:43:11.531 --> 01:43:14.320
we're going from a country might stuff to our country to make stuff up.

1802
01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:17.800
We ever hear what Putin said about the United States is before the crash,

1803
01:43:17.801 --> 01:43:19.600
he said,
I don't understand the United States economy.

1804
01:43:19.601 --> 01:43:24.280
It seems that they just buy and sell each other's houses.
He was right.
Yeah.

1805
01:43:24.281 --> 01:43:26.230
I mean,
it was all before the shit hit the fan.

1806
01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:29.680
It's all these wacky financial instruments are moving numbers on a screen.

1807
01:43:29.710 --> 01:43:31.630
How can that be fixed though?
I mean,
first of all,

1808
01:43:31.650 --> 01:43:36.400
you're the only way to fix the Koch brother's situation is what I mean is

1809
01:43:36.401 --> 01:43:39.520
there's no way,
right?
I mean,
you would have to,
well,
you have to and you know,

1810
01:43:39.790 --> 01:43:43.500
yeah,
you'd have to end all,
all speculation.
But,
uh,
you know,
Robert Reich,

1811
01:43:43.501 --> 01:43:47.650
who speaks about this extensively is you have a trading tax at the moment.
They,

1812
01:43:47.651 --> 01:43:52.100
these guys can tried mine pips every pip of a scream.
You know today,
you know the

1813
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.170
<v 3>three decimal places,
wherever it's own currency,</v>

1814
01:43:54.171 --> 01:43:58.130
whether it's on gas and then when you're moving tens and hundreds of millions of

1815
01:43:58.130 --> 01:44:00.620
dollars.
One pip is a ton of money,
but it does not.

1816
01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:04.550
There should be a trading tax on each one of these trades because there's volume

1817
01:44:04.551 --> 01:44:07.880
of tried his volume,
money benefit society and no measurable Maine.

1818
01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:12.320
<v 0>God Damn Man.
What a what a weird world we live in when that's real.</v>

1819
01:44:12.321 --> 01:44:14.420
These are the numbers that Jamie just threw up here.

1820
01:44:14.421 --> 01:44:19.421
The collective wealth for the sixth richest Walton's rose from 73 billion to 90

1821
01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:20.211
billion.
Why?

1822
01:44:20.211 --> 01:44:25.211
The wealth of the average American declined from 126,000 to seventy seven

1823
01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:27.710
thousand thirteen million Americans have negative net worth.

1824
01:44:28.130 --> 01:44:30.530
That's the crazy thing cause I was exactly right.

1825
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:35.120
Warman heads and they'll have more wealth than the bottom 42% and not just make

1826
01:44:35.121 --> 01:44:38.000
numbers up.
I didn't think you did.
I didn't even check.

1827
01:44:38.001 --> 01:44:40.050
I thought you were telling the truth for sure.
Yup did.

1828
01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:43.160
There was a recent article that I brought up at yesterday's podcast,

1829
01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:46.100
Michael Shermer road in scientific American.

1830
01:44:46.101 --> 01:44:50.180
That was torn apart about the myth of,
uh,
financial inequality.

1831
01:44:50.181 --> 01:44:52.550
It was like one of the dumbest articles I've ever written.

1832
01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:55.700
And when it was the way I know whether something's dumb as if I think it's dumb,

1833
01:44:56.210 --> 01:45:00.290
because if I can see the logical fallacies in your argument about finance,

1834
01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:03.690
I mean,
it was just,
but what is that common from there?
What is this?
Like,

1835
01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:04.790
everything's fine.

1836
01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:08.420
Everything's fine thing where people want to sort of manipulate statistics and

1837
01:45:08.421 --> 01:45:12.350
look at things from sort of a rose colored glasses point of view.
What's that?

1838
01:45:12.351 --> 01:45:13.820
From what,
what causes people,

1839
01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:18.050
<v 3>people have no experience to what the root of what is happening in America.
I,</v>

1840
01:45:18.051 --> 01:45:20.920
you know,
I,
I live,
I'm not gonna say it and I'm at a town

1841
01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:26.500
<v 0>in the air,
live in a nice spot in know I was fine in the area I live.
Yeah,</v>

1842
01:45:26.610 --> 01:45:30.920
<v 3>he is,
you know,
I'm going to guess 90% white,
um,
and,
and,</v>

1843
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:34.010
and wealthy to moderately wealthy,
too wealthy.

1844
01:45:34.190 --> 01:45:38.180
And they have no clue what's happening in the,
you know,
these rust belt states.

1845
01:45:38.181 --> 01:45:41.270
He's,
you know,
uh,
you know,
for the northwest,
which are particularly the,

1846
01:45:41.290 --> 01:45:44.060
the basis of manufacturing,
I mean,
uh,

1847
01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:48.380
these are economies which had been absolutely destroyed,
prefer globalization.

1848
01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:52.400
There is no economic in recovery.
You know,
despite in spoke with just before,

1849
01:45:52.401 --> 01:45:55.790
despite the Dow hit record highs and despite the unemployment number happening,

1850
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:59.690
we're not going to get these jobs back because we now have the Walmart business

1851
01:45:59.691 --> 01:46:03.020
model is the model that the rest of the corporate world and this country

1852
01:46:03.021 --> 01:46:07.580
emulates.
In the 18th century.
It was the Pennsylvania railroad railroad,
uh,

1853
01:46:07.610 --> 01:46:11.450
country in the 20th century was IBM.
Today it's Walmart.

1854
01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:13.700
So what Walmart deals with,
it's,
it,
it,

1855
01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:17.210
it makes cities bid against each other to get tax breaks to move it.

1856
01:46:17.210 --> 01:46:19.340
So they can say,
hey,
we're going to put a store in your place.

1857
01:46:19.670 --> 01:46:21.740
They get to cities a bit against it.
The,

1858
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:25.130
so it becomes a race to the bottom as far as corporate sob disease and welfare.

1859
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:30.530
Every time a Walmart,
a store opens,
every time Walmart employs a new employee,

1860
01:46:30.710 --> 01:46:35.030
1.4 American workers is displaced.
Now their control,

1861
01:46:35.050 --> 01:46:35.960
the American economy,

1862
01:46:35.961 --> 01:46:40.380
the retail economy is so dominant that to have such control over their
suppliers,

1863
01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:45.230
procurement at Walmart,
they demand a 5% reduction of their,

1864
01:46:45.290 --> 01:46:47.000
of their supplies every year.

1865
01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:52.050
If you can't reduce your costs to warm up by 5% every year and then we'll fuck

1866
01:46:52.051 --> 01:46:54.990
off.
Goodbye.
So after about five years of doing this,

1867
01:46:54.991 --> 01:46:59.430
where you've cut 5% 5% eventually warm,
Matt says to their suppliers,

1868
01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:03.100
will you need to move to China?
And if you don't meet and if you move to China,

1869
01:47:03.130 --> 01:47:05.250
we'll help you set up if you don't move the train.
And we don't,

1870
01:47:05.251 --> 01:47:06.570
we do no business,
no longer.

1871
01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.760
And that has happened with countless number of companies.

1872
01:47:08.761 --> 01:47:10.920
Companies like Rubbermaid,
a great American company,

1873
01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:15.360
which had a workforce in the hundreds of thousands of people in the 70s in the

1874
01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:19.140
80s you know,
almost no longer exists in that form anymore because they couldn't,

1875
01:47:19.170 --> 01:47:22.800
you know,
initially they didn't move to China,
but they have now.
So there's,

1876
01:47:22.801 --> 01:47:26.470
there's globalization is free trade is not benefiting anyone.
Um,

1877
01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:28.440
and that's the model that we operate under.

1878
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:31.310
<v 0>Is there a way to up,
first of all that there was a number that you threw out.</v>

1879
01:47:31.311 --> 01:47:34.340
Then I get confused about,
you said for every time a Walmart,

1880
01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:38.270
Walmart opens 1.4 Americans are misplaced,
he's displaced.

1881
01:47:38.530 --> 01:47:40.850
What does it 1.4 what is that?
It's one person.

1882
01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:45.410
<v 3>Well,
so every time a Walmart employees I person 1.4 Americans loses it.</v>

1883
01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:48.820
<v 0>[inaudible] wait time.
They employ one person,
1.4 million.</v>

1884
01:47:49.230 --> 01:47:53.030
So for every one person they employ more than one.

1885
01:47:53.490 --> 01:47:55.760
That kind of makes sense.
And the mom and pop store,

1886
01:47:55.761 --> 01:48:00.761
the death of the mom and pop store has it been really criticized both by people

1887
01:48:01.821 --> 01:48:05.570
that are against Walmart,
but I'll tell people that they're saying,
you know,

1888
01:48:05.571 --> 01:48:08.690
why don't you shop and vote with your dollar?

1889
01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:13.880
Appreciate mom and pop stores and they cost five more dollars when you go in

1890
01:48:13.881 --> 01:48:16.400
there,
just go pay them the five more dollars.

1891
01:48:16.401 --> 01:48:20.060
Do you understand how Walmart is making things so cheap?

1892
01:48:20.061 --> 01:48:23.540
Do you understand that the people that work there with the number that you threw

1893
01:48:23.541 --> 01:48:26.270
around that for every Walmart worker we pay,

1894
01:48:26.271 --> 01:48:28.820
what was the amount of money that every person has to pay in tax dollars,

1895
01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:31.400
$1,300 this,
those,
those,

1896
01:48:31.401 --> 01:48:35.450
if those things were just made more clear and people voted with their dollar

1897
01:48:35.451 --> 01:48:39.890
more,
do you think it's possible that something like Walmart can slowly die away?

1898
01:48:39.891 --> 01:48:44.180
That these monolithic corporations that have this massive control over economies

1899
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.761
<v 3>but,
but that,</v>

1900
01:48:44.761 --> 01:48:48.790
that Walmart destroys communities to such an extent that people in these

1901
01:48:48.791 --> 01:48:52.450
communities can only afford to shop at Walmart and becomes this vicious cycle?

1902
01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:55.210
Um,
so it's a,
you know,
you,

1903
01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:58.630
unless you put in policies which regulate,

1904
01:48:58.631 --> 01:49:01.290
tried and protect the working class,
but taking a class,

1905
01:49:01.291 --> 01:49:05.720
you're not going there to,
uh,
to solve the problem.
So,
and,

1906
01:49:05.810 --> 01:49:09.040
and this is not a great sort of hypocrisy is how,
for example,

1907
01:49:09.041 --> 01:49:13.090
the Republican Party presents itself as the Party of small business because it's

1908
01:49:13.091 --> 01:49:17.320
a nice nostalgic pitch up,
draws it.
It's painted in people's mind.

1909
01:49:17.321 --> 01:49:20.880
That picture of Myron par small business operation,
uh,
you know,

1910
01:49:20.881 --> 01:49:25.780
in mine straight in,
in middle America,
but,
but name a single policy that,
uh,

1911
01:49:25.781 --> 01:49:28.600
the Republican Party have helped a small businesses.
We have,

1912
01:49:28.601 --> 01:49:32.560
have they as the Republican party protected the modern power operation from

1913
01:49:32.561 --> 01:49:33.570
these monopolies.

1914
01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:37.300
Oligopolies did I give the same tax breaks that they do these corporate

1915
01:49:37.301 --> 01:49:40.510
subsidies as they do to these big organizations to drown a business out now they

1916
01:49:40.511 --> 01:49:41.500
haven't,
you know,

1917
01:49:41.501 --> 01:49:44.170
the Republican pies and looks out for the small business at all and his country

1918
01:49:44.171 --> 01:49:45.610
and,
and uh,
yeah.
Yeah.

1919
01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:49.900
<v 0>And that's just the way is,
I mean,
no one's finding against that.
This is not,</v>

1920
01:49:49.901 --> 01:49:53.710
that's not like a big rallying cry of new Democrats nor the Republicans.

1921
01:49:53.711 --> 01:49:55.750
This is not something that anybody's bringing up.

1922
01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:59.630
<v 3>No.
And,
and that comes to political ignorance and political ignorance.</v>

1923
01:49:59.631 --> 01:50:03.800
Born from either our education system or the fact that the mainstream media,

1924
01:50:04.190 --> 01:50:07.850
um,
only reports titillating,
you know,
issues.
You know,
we're,

1925
01:50:07.851 --> 01:50:11.630
we're still talking about flight missing.
M eight three 70 or Anna Nicole Smith,

1926
01:50:11.631 --> 01:50:12.620
Steph,
you know,

1927
01:50:12.621 --> 01:50:16.640
it's a focus on celebrity and a trivia rather than on the real issues.

1928
01:50:16.641 --> 01:50:18.590
There's no Walter Cronkite's in the news anymore.

1929
01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:21.090
<v 0>And that is true.
There's no real news anymore.</v>

1930
01:50:21.091 --> 01:50:25.200
There's television programs that highlight their entertainment programs that

1931
01:50:25.201 --> 01:50:27.360
highlight things they think people are going to be interested in,

1932
01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:29.460
but they don't have a desire for journalism.

1933
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:32.420
<v 3>Well,
and they don't.
And it's corporate control media.
Ha Ha.</v>

1934
01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:34.070
How many places and you know,

1935
01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:37.400
how many venues on corporate owned media do you think I'm going to get book when

1936
01:50:37.401 --> 01:50:39.390
I talk about the corporate totalitarian state?

1937
01:50:39.670 --> 01:50:44.350
<v 0>Not a lot.
Your show,
you can come back for sure.
Yeah.
Do you,</v>

1938
01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:48.910
you get chills down your spine when you see things like what's going on with

1939
01:50:48.911 --> 01:50:52.000
Edward Snowden when you see what's going on with Julian Assan,

1940
01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:57.040
when people do expose some really horrific things that our government's involved

1941
01:50:58.061 --> 01:51:00.640
with,
uh,
the underpinnings of our society itself,

1942
01:51:00.810 --> 01:51:05.740
the mechanism involved in w what's turning the wheels of the military industrial

1943
01:51:05.741 --> 01:51:08.850
complex.
When that gets exposed.
And you see like the,

1944
01:51:08.890 --> 01:51:13.870
some court just upheld the arrest warrant against Julian Assange from,
for what?

1945
01:51:13.871 --> 01:51:18.020
For having sex with a woman is supposedly,
or whatever the fuck they,

1946
01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:22.900
some one of the most dubious and questionable charges of all time that's

1947
01:51:22.901 --> 01:51:25.510
involved in an international incident.
I mean,

1948
01:51:25.511 --> 01:51:27.910
is there ever been a more transparent situation when someone,

1949
01:51:27.911 --> 01:51:30.460
they're going after someone and pretending it's something else?

1950
01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:34.030
<v 3>I mean,
it's always dangerous grounds to,
uh,
um,</v>

1951
01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:37.140
to I guess to trivialize any rape charge,
but you're dead right?
I mean,

1952
01:51:37.330 --> 01:51:40.270
the rape charge it was,
yeah,
it's,

1953
01:51:40.271 --> 01:51:44.140
so they're the circumstances which I have read a so fishy and dubious as you've

1954
01:51:44.141 --> 01:51:45.930
said,
but,
uh,
you know,
I,

1955
01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:49.480
the one of the most frustrating things is we would be more,

1956
01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:54.370
the American population certainly would be more angry about the NSA overreach if

1957
01:51:54.371 --> 01:51:56.320
there was a republican in office.
Uh,

1958
01:51:56.380 --> 01:52:01.320
the fact that it's a bomber in office has a plicated,
uh,

1959
01:52:01.330 --> 01:52:03.930
you know,
democrats and the liberal class,
I just think,
oh,
well,

1960
01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:08.010
if Obama is happy with it,
it must mean it's okay.
I guess it's not too bad.
And,

1961
01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:11.400
and,
and also part of the problem muse with,
you know,
in the millennial puppet,

1962
01:52:11.410 --> 01:52:15.130
the mental it millennial generation,
it's,
you know,
it's,
hey,
look at me,
you know,

1963
01:52:15.131 --> 01:52:19.060
um,
so we've come such a high look at me,
you know,
Instagram,
selfies,

1964
01:52:19.061 --> 01:52:20.350
Facebook accounts,
Twitter,

1965
01:52:20.351 --> 01:52:23.530
and the more extreme they think the more exposure the better.
Um,

1966
01:52:23.531 --> 01:52:26.380
so when they're talking about,
you know,
being watched,
well,

1967
01:52:26.410 --> 01:52:27.860
they like being watched and that

1968
01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:32.340
<v 0>there is that thing though,
that it,</v>

1969
01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:37.740
if it was a republican that was an office and you were dealing with this Nsa

1970
01:52:37.741 --> 01:52:38.131
leak,

1971
01:52:38.131 --> 01:52:41.640
where do you find out that they're downloading every fucking email you have?

1972
01:52:41.641 --> 01:52:45.150
Every phone call you make is being recorded.
People would be up in arms,

1973
01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:46.370
but because of the fact

1974
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:47.210
<v 2>that it's a Democrat,</v>

1975
01:52:47.211 --> 01:52:51.890
the very same people who would be up in arms are sort of letting it slide in a

1976
01:52:51.891 --> 01:52:55.690
way.
Yeah.
Partisanship.
It is.
And that's,
that's how,
you know,

1977
01:52:55.730 --> 01:52:57.360
coming back to what I said earlier,
you know,
we're,

1978
01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:01.850
we're living in the most polarized moment in American history and we only see

1979
01:53:01.851 --> 01:53:06.200
things in issues through the lens of our political parties.
You know,
we've,

1980
01:53:06.630 --> 01:53:10.250
we've deeply entrenched in our own camps and we only listened to the talking

1981
01:53:10.251 --> 01:53:14.750
heads who feed red meat to our respective camps were goofy as fuck.

1982
01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:17.070
In other words,
not too many conservatives,

1983
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:20.210
not too many tea party voters read my pieces.
You know,

1984
01:53:20.211 --> 01:53:24.200
in Salon Salon you can beat,
well,
if they do read it,

1985
01:53:24.201 --> 01:53:26.570
they read it to get angry or they go out to the rifle range.

1986
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:31.070
Fucking she pumpkin's with Obama's picture pasted on it.
You know,

1987
01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:34.970
God damn it.
You hear what he said about Jesus?

1988
01:53:36.850 --> 01:53:38.630
Yeah.
Well you're,
you're,
you know,

1989
01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:41.630
you're actively trying to piss him off with use your,
your titles of your books,

1990
01:53:41.631 --> 01:53:46.300
right?
I think so.
Crucifying America,
uh,

1991
01:53:46.670 --> 01:53:50.960
atheist can't be Republicans got heights.
You hiding back?
Yeah.

1992
01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:54.140
All those.
Yeah.
I just got an email yesterday saying God doesn't hate you.

1993
01:53:54.141 --> 01:53:58.220
Everybody else does.
Oh,
how rude.
God loves you,
but I hate you.

1994
01:53:58.221 --> 01:54:01.580
Is that what they're saying?
Well then you're not a child of God.

1995
01:54:01.610 --> 01:54:06.260
Who the fuck are you?
You know,
you're not doing it right.
Right.
They're not there.

1996
01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:07.700
They're doing it wrong.
You can't,

1997
01:54:07.701 --> 01:54:12.350
you can't just run around saying that God doesn't hate you,
but I do.
Exactly.

1998
01:54:12.351 --> 01:54:15.650
Fuck if you know that,
if you know God doesn't it,
you're supposed to love them,

1999
01:54:15.651 --> 01:54:19.100
then there's not this supposed to do turn the other cheek.
Yeah.

2000
01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:20.270
I don't see much forgiveness.

2001
01:54:20.271 --> 01:54:23.390
I'm not covering my copy much forgiveness and I've never met a real Christian

2002
01:54:23.391 --> 01:54:27.410
like that will be like forgive you for your,
your actually,
you know,

2003
01:54:27.411 --> 01:54:32.370
I have a lot of friends who are Christians and as you said this twice.
Yeah.

2004
01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:34.990
You said,
he said,
I have a lot of friends who are Christians.

2005
01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.880
You said a lot of friends who are right wing.
We put a lot of gay friends.

2006
01:54:37.881 --> 01:54:40.140
I said that as well.
Just make it up.

2007
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.810
I knew it to be honest.
Be Honest.

2008
01:54:44.811 --> 01:54:47.450
I think there's 7 billion people in the world.
I really only know four of them

2009
01:54:49.170 --> 01:54:52.010
really well.
Right?
Yeah,
exactly.
But I do,

2010
01:54:52.011 --> 01:54:55.940
I mean actually it's funny moments and I had this conversation with a friend the

2011
01:54:55.940 --> 01:55:00.740
other day.
Uh,
every Mormon I've made is actually super nice.
You know,
actually,

2012
01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:03.860
one of the hardest moments on the planet is a Abby Huntsman.
You know,

2013
01:55:03.870 --> 01:55:07.360
Jon Huntsman's,
our daughter,
she's on MSNBC.
I'm a guy and I,

2014
01:55:07.361 --> 01:55:10.890
and I do have a little crush on her,
but uh,
yeah.
Yeah.

2015
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:15.980
What's her name?
Abby Huntsman.
I don't watch MSNBC.

2016
01:55:16.150 --> 01:55:18.620
I try to avoid all mainstream media at this point.

2017
01:55:18.621 --> 01:55:20.570
I get almost all my news from the Internet.

2018
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:23.180
I'm kind of completely given up on watching Fox.

2019
01:55:23.210 --> 01:55:25.100
I might watch Fox just for the hot chicks.

2020
01:55:25.590 --> 01:55:29.330
I watch Fox just to see chicks cross and uncross the legs or back and forth.

2021
01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:34.010
Is this her?
She's a Mormon.
Yeah.
Yeah,
she is.
She's beautiful.

2022
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:38.720
But she's a silly bitch.
There's no doubt about it.
If you're a Mormon,

2023
01:55:39.130 --> 01:55:41.690
I don't care.
You can be a moonie.
It can be a scientologist.

2024
01:55:41.730 --> 01:55:43.500
It's all the same to me.
Yeah.

2025
01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:47.460
<v 0>All right.
Do you know you could be born a Mormon?
You know,</v>

2026
01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:50.550
he'd get locked into it.
I had a neighbor who was a Mormon who is great,

2027
01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:55.890
nicest guy,
super sweet people.
They're very friendly,
very,
you know,

2028
01:55:56.010 --> 01:55:57.300
very warm and compassionate.

2029
01:55:57.380 --> 01:55:59.900
<v 3>Well,
and it's also true,
I like to say to the south,</v>

2030
01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:04.550
you traveled down to the seventh Stites and individually the nicest people on

2031
01:56:04.551 --> 01:56:07.310
the planet.
You know,
southern hospitality is a real thing,

2032
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:09.280
but put them all in the room together,

2033
01:56:09.490 --> 01:56:11.580
talking about the biggest bunch of bigoted ass.

2034
01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:16.080
I'll talk about taking their guns and black men,
fucking their daughters

2035
01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:20.830
knocked on my watch.
Yeah.

2036
01:56:21.610 --> 01:56:24.820
<v 0>I think a lot of that is again,
fear,
ignorance.</v>

2037
01:56:24.850 --> 01:56:29.800
These isolated folks that live in these small towns that are separated from the

2038
01:56:29.801 --> 01:56:33.510
larger cities,
by vast distances as larger cities mean,
you know,

2039
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:37.210
tend to be the centers of diversity.
Yeah,
yeah.
You're gonna have,

2040
01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:40.190
you're gonna have ignorance and fear a lot of those places,
but you know,

2041
01:56:40.230 --> 01:56:43.870
it's also fed upon by the politicians that are running for office and those very

2042
01:56:43.871 --> 01:56:44.360
areas.

2043
01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:47.930
<v 3>Exactly.
And it's fed.
It's fed upon by this right wing echo chamber,</v>

2044
01:56:47.931 --> 01:56:50.600
which constantly it keeps them fit.
Or the external enemy,

2045
01:56:50.601 --> 01:56:53.300
whether that's liberals,
whether that's Muslims,
whatever.
It's,
you know,

2046
01:56:53.810 --> 01:56:57.650
what a chamber,
communists,
but isn't salon kind of an echo chamber to the left?

2047
01:56:57.651 --> 01:57:02.510
A little bit.
Yeah.
It's a very,
very friendly audience.
Yeah.

2048
01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:05.980
Very friendly audience to the left.
Yeah.
I mean there's certain things,

2049
01:57:06.330 --> 01:57:10.190
but it will say you do have an echo chamber on the left,
but in the left,
uh,

2050
01:57:10.250 --> 01:57:14.250
echo chamber facts aren't made up.
Uh,
whereas in,
in,

2051
01:57:14.251 --> 01:57:17.090
in that right wing echo chamber,
there's a total disregard for facts.

2052
01:57:17.091 --> 01:57:20.000
Even Romney's a head pollster,
uh,

2053
01:57:20.001 --> 01:57:22.550
Neil and I can't remember his last name and I guess it doesn't matter,

2054
01:57:22.551 --> 01:57:25.900
but he even said it on camera.
You know,
facts don't matter,
you know,

2055
01:57:25.930 --> 01:57:30.050
in this campaign,
Jamie,
come on.
I mean,
they can,
they can say anything.

2056
01:57:31.670 --> 01:57:36.560
Uh,
I think there's a big wing in the establishment wing of the Republican Party

2057
01:57:36.561 --> 01:57:38.900
that wants him to run a,
I don't think you will,

2058
01:57:38.901 --> 01:57:42.800
but the establishment is desperate for a candidate because at the moment,

2059
01:57:42.801 --> 01:57:46.670
Rand Paul is going to be the nomination and he scares the life out of

2060
01:57:46.671 --> 01:57:50.090
establishment Republicans because he's not in the icon.

2061
01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:52.130
That's why Dick Cheney's in the media at the moment,
at the moment,

2062
01:57:52.131 --> 01:57:56.510
trying to water down his isolationists libertarian wing of the Republican Party.

2063
01:57:56.511 --> 01:58:00.650
Because as it stands today,
he would be the nominee,
right?
Rand Paul.

2064
01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:05.270
And what scares people about Rand Paul?
What's,
what should scare people,
but well,

2065
01:58:05.930 --> 01:58:10.820
what scares me?
You asking me what scares me?
Well,
uh,

2066
01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:13.550
I,
well he's a libertarian for for one.

2067
01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:16.460
I think libertarianism is a word,

2068
01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:20.030
only exacerbate the winner takes all society that we have at the moment.

2069
01:58:20.031 --> 01:58:21.140
We need to be doing the,
uh,

2070
01:58:21.141 --> 01:58:25.820
the opposite of that libertarianism would grant more power to the corporations

2071
01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:29.330
in this country and less,
uh,
what scares there,

2072
01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:32.510
the establishment and the Republican Party is,
he's an isolationist.

2073
01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:34.820
And so the military industrial complex,

2074
01:58:35.210 --> 01:58:38.540
and it was a great pace done recently that if Hillary is the nominee and rand

2075
01:58:38.541 --> 01:58:41.980
Paul's a nominee,
neo cons will vote for,
you know,

2076
01:58:42.030 --> 01:58:43.840
Neocon Republicans will vote for Hillary

2077
01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:48.700
because she's more hawkish than,
uh,
than Rand Paul is.

2078
01:58:49.090 --> 01:58:52.480
<v 0>Whoa.
That would be crazy.</v>

2079
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:55.910
Could you imagine Dick Cheney advising people to vote for,

2080
01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:59.860
for vote for Hillary Clinton over Rand Paul?
He would.

2081
01:58:59.970 --> 01:59:03.130
Do you imagine a race of Hillary Clinton versus Ran Paul?

2082
01:59:03.190 --> 01:59:07.220
It would be the biggest landslide since Lbj.
Barry Goldwater 60.

2083
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:11.800
You Think Hillary would win?
I think Hillary could almost win every state.
Whoa.

2084
01:59:12.250 --> 01:59:15.430
Hello.
Am I sweating?
Was the rice would hold people back from,

2085
01:59:15.490 --> 01:59:16.810
from voting for Rand Paul?

2086
01:59:17.070 --> 01:59:20.760
<v 3>Well,
I,
well,
he's,
he's ideas,
you know,
uh,</v>

2087
01:59:21.190 --> 01:59:24.640
or unproven except for Somalia,
number one.
Uh,

2088
01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:27.030
I think that a lot of things are going to come back to haunt him.

2089
01:59:27.031 --> 01:59:28.890
He doesn't believe in the Civil Rights Act.

2090
01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:33.650
He believes that private property trumps everything.
Uh,
you know,
he's,
he,

2091
01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:35.970
you know,
there's a great video of human,
he's asked,
well,

2092
01:59:35.971 --> 01:59:38.430
do you believe in the civil rights sec?
Well,
I don't know,

2093
01:59:38.431 --> 01:59:40.320
but I kind of think it was a good thing.

2094
01:59:40.321 --> 01:59:43.200
But I also think private property owners and restaurant owners have the right

2095
01:59:43.201 --> 01:59:44.020
not to serve.

2096
01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:46.290
He didn't use the word blacks where they have the right and said black people

2097
01:59:46.291 --> 01:59:49.850
that don't want to,
you know,
so,
uh,
so I,
you know,
I,

2098
01:59:49.851 --> 01:59:52.380
I think he'd be a disastrous candidate.
Um,

2099
01:59:52.410 --> 01:59:55.320
very cold water that the same people who voted for Barry Goldwater,

2100
01:59:55.321 --> 01:59:57.600
the same people that vote for Rand Paul.
And,

2101
01:59:57.601 --> 02:00:01.110
and we saw what happened to Goldwater Americares is that's not where America is.

2102
02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:06.070
America is a sin and left country.
Not if the people tree love his dad.
Huh?

2103
02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:11.310
People love his dad.
Well,
what,
why well to do people love these dead,
you know,

2104
02:00:11.311 --> 02:00:14.130
he's a bit,
he's in New York,
confederate.
I mean,
you know,

2105
02:00:14.131 --> 02:00:17.470
and Rand Paul is in the confederate.
I mean a,
he's a,
you know,

2106
02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:20.520
regularly speaks at sons and confederate meetings.
I mean,

2107
02:00:20.521 --> 02:00:24.870
it's all about nullification,
states' rights.
It's uh,
you know,
uh,

2108
02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:27.900
what one state,
what does it state rights means?
That means these countries,

2109
02:00:27.930 --> 02:00:32.770
they Stites can,
uh,
you know,
ban abortion,
uh,
denied black people the right to,
uh,

2110
02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:35.850
to 10 restaurants.
You know,
coloureds only

2111
02:00:36.230 --> 02:00:38.560
<v 0>it means they get it allowed gay marriage.</v>

2112
02:00:38.561 --> 02:00:41.380
They can allow people to smoke marijuana.

2113
02:00:41.410 --> 02:00:44.410
They can allow people to do a lot of things that,
you know,

2114
02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:47.190
the federal government does not allow.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2115
02:00:47.210 --> 02:00:52.170
It's not entirely a negative thing.
Like the idea of states' rights.
Yup.
Yeah.

2116
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:56.740
You're not interventionist foreign policy,
which is a good feeling.
Um,
yeah,

2117
02:00:56.741 --> 02:00:59.620
I'm for that.
I think ramp Ron Paul had some very good ideas.

2118
02:00:59.650 --> 02:01:03.820
It's definitely a wacky old dude,
but who's not,
you know,

2119
02:01:03.821 --> 02:01:07.330
how many old dudes get stay alive and especially in the world of politics,

2120
02:01:07.331 --> 02:01:12.331
get to be that old and just don't have utter disdain for the established system.

2121
02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:14.620
Yeah,
yeah.

2122
02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:19.620
I mean that there's this whole thing that we've been doing from the beginning of

2123
02:01:19.691 --> 02:01:24.220
time of profiting off of sending young men to death for things that they don't

2124
02:01:24.221 --> 02:01:25.270
understand,
you know,

2125
02:01:25.271 --> 02:01:30.060
sending over them to fight and foreign lands for some cause that they,

2126
02:01:30.070 --> 02:01:33.100
they're not gonna,
they don't know what they're doing.
They're too young.

2127
02:01:33.101 --> 02:01:35.560
They're too young to see the hustle.
I mean that's the,

2128
02:01:35.561 --> 02:01:40.040
that's the oldest trick in the book as far as like the,
and that was

2129
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:44.930
<v 3>one that Ron Paul stood very firmly against and he was one of the few people</v>

2130
02:01:44.931 --> 02:01:47.690
that was doing it right or left.
I'm,

2131
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:51.380
I'm with Ron Paul and Rand Paul when it comes to military and I'm,

2132
02:01:51.381 --> 02:01:55.100
we've both of them when it comes to the dry ending,
the drug war,
but you know,

2133
02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:57.830
thinking that,
uh,
uh,
Ron Polo,

2134
02:01:57.831 --> 02:02:01.190
Rand Paul is good for America because they're antidrug an antiwar is like

2135
02:02:01.191 --> 02:02:03.890
thinking of big Mac is good for you because it has led us in a pickle.

2136
02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:08.120
What is good for America though at this point in time when you,
well,

2137
02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:11.840
we've clearly established that you've got massive amounts of money.

2138
02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:14.600
That's what financing politics.
But what is it good for?

2139
02:02:14.601 --> 02:02:17.000
America is what has already worked in the past.

2140
02:02:17.001 --> 02:02:21.260
And what has worked in the past was FDRS new deal.

2141
02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:25.070
And that is socialism.
Americare came out of the gilded age.

2142
02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:28.070
We went into the biggest economic crisis America has ever seen.

2143
02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.570
We implemented social reforms,
economic reforms,
political reforms,

2144
02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:35.410
and from the end of World War Two,

2145
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:40.400
1980 we built the great American middle class where we built the most prosperous

2146
02:02:40.401 --> 02:02:43.640
middle class the world has ever seen.
We put a man on the moon.

2147
02:02:43.641 --> 02:02:46.280
We built the interstate highway systems.
We had the GI bill.

2148
02:02:46.281 --> 02:02:49.370
We had free education with Accenture to catch to education.

2149
02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:54.210
We established Medicaid with the great society and say Laverne and Shirley.
Yeah,

2150
02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:56.570
good shit happen in,
in,
in,
well,
you know,

2151
02:02:56.600 --> 02:02:59.030
my dad lived in America for 10 years during the 60s.

2152
02:02:59.031 --> 02:03:02.480
His generation during that time,
just the husband just,

2153
02:03:02.481 --> 02:03:06.710
you dad worked and you still had enough to afford a mortgage and have two cars.

2154
02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:11.570
Now both husband and my dad and mother have to work.

2155
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:13.760
They can barely keep their head above water.

2156
02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:17.210
They're saddled with debt with no way out.
And that's the world we live.

2157
02:03:17.211 --> 02:03:20.930
We have to go back to,
uh,
to that area and we have to put in social,

2158
02:03:20.931 --> 02:03:23.630
economic and political reforms,
which,
which,
uh,

2159
02:03:23.690 --> 02:03:26.090
redistribute the wealth from the top back to the middle.

2160
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:29.420
And then how would you do that?
It's like if someone came to you,

2161
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:31.790
you have all these radical ideas,
you've written books about it.

2162
02:03:31.791 --> 02:03:35.750
If someone was running for President Elizabeth Warren or who else,

2163
02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:39.730
whoever it is that reads your stuff,
what would you implement?
I mean,
how,

2164
02:03:39.731 --> 02:03:43.180
how would you fix this and in a reasonable way that makes sense.
Well,
yeah,

2165
02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:47.910
number one is the tax cut because you know,
uh,
where,
where their,

2166
02:03:48.150 --> 02:03:49.460
their denial of,

2167
02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:53.360
of tax revenue to the federal government is extreme at the moment.
That's why,

2168
02:03:53.361 --> 02:03:53.601
you know,

2169
02:03:53.601 --> 02:03:56.610
we said early America doesn't have nice things is because corporations are

2170
02:03:56.611 --> 02:04:00.140
contributing the lowest percentage of the overall revenue to the federal

2171
02:04:00.141 --> 02:04:02.150
government.
So,
but if you contribute more money,

2172
02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:05.480
where's that money go to dictate where that money?
Well,

2173
02:04:05.481 --> 02:04:07.970
first of all is you're building an infrastructure.
I mean,

2174
02:04:08.210 --> 02:04:12.930
infrastructure is falling apart in this country and spending money on it's back

2175
02:04:12.931 --> 02:04:15.560
goes back to Keynesian economics,
which has worked in the past.

2176
02:04:15.561 --> 02:04:18.710
And we'll work again.
We have to build bridges,
we have to build highway systems,

2177
02:04:18.711 --> 02:04:22.310
we have to build higher speed railway that create jobs and that creates markets

2178
02:04:22.311 --> 02:04:26.330
in,
in new economies.
Um,
we have to,
uh,
uh,

2179
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:30.290
build up the middle class and the working class.
We have better labor reforms.

2180
02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:32.180
We've,
we've gone from,
you know,

2181
02:04:32.210 --> 02:04:35.750
from the moment and Reagan destroy the unions will suck the air traffic

2182
02:04:35.751 --> 02:04:40.751
controllers in 1981 we've gone from America protected by collective bargaining,

2183
02:04:41.101 --> 02:04:46.101
went from something like 35% to 7% today in every social democratic country like

2184
02:04:47.281 --> 02:04:49.620
Australia and Scandinavia and western Europe,

2185
02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:53.820
upwards of 85% of the populations that covered by collective bargaining.

2186
02:04:53.821 --> 02:04:57.450
So the workers have a say or a shared prosperity,
you know,
from,

2187
02:04:57.451 --> 02:05:00.720
from 1954 to 1979,

2188
02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:04.440
there are productivity gains was shared equally between corporations and the

2189
02:05:04.441 --> 02:05:05.161
working class.

2190
02:05:05.161 --> 02:05:09.480
Today only 12% of the gains are shared to the working class and middle class.

2191
02:05:09.481 --> 02:05:14.130
So we have to,
that comes through the tax code.
It comes for a labor reform,

2192
02:05:14.490 --> 02:05:18.030
um,
uh,
access to healthcare and education and so forth.

2193
02:05:18.370 --> 02:05:23.370
<v 0>Do you trust the federal government to do the appropriate thing with the new</v>

2194
02:05:23.561 --> 02:05:27.300
taxes?
Like save?
We did reform the tax code and we'd say,

2195
02:05:27.301 --> 02:05:31.870
if we did change the contributions that corporations are forced to make,

2196
02:05:32.590 --> 02:05:36.070
do you really trust the government as it's in place right now with all of its

2197
02:05:36.071 --> 02:05:40.000
glorious and competence to redistribute that money and do a good job with it?

2198
02:05:40.180 --> 02:05:43.600
<v 3>Well,
it's,
you know,
it's,
it's,
you know,
people will say,
oh,
well,
you know,</v>

2199
02:05:43.601 --> 02:05:44.980
government always does a shitty job.

2200
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:49.120
Cooperation's 90% of corporations file in their first five years.

2201
02:05:49.121 --> 02:05:53.980
So government is not a perfect,
perfect solution or a perfect be all to end all.

2202
02:05:53.981 --> 02:05:56.430
But there has to be a balance,
uh,
where,
you know,

2203
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:59.110
and when we have that in other countries,
what is capital investment,

2204
02:05:59.111 --> 02:06:03.940
but also public investment in public,
in public investment or liberalism,

2205
02:06:03.941 --> 02:06:06.940
liberalism was never meant to be a left wing thing.

2206
02:06:07.210 --> 02:06:12.210
Liberalism was always meant to be a counter veiling power to capitalism where

2207
02:06:12.371 --> 02:06:13.330
capitalism,

2208
02:06:13.630 --> 02:06:17.950
full short liberalism was supposed to pick up the slack and protect the

2209
02:06:17.951 --> 02:06:20.020
downtrodden and the paper at the things that people,

2210
02:06:20.021 --> 02:06:24.070
that capitalism leaves behind and you need public investment to,

2211
02:06:24.150 --> 02:06:26.160
to fund those initiatives.
I,

2212
02:06:26.210 --> 02:06:30.340
there's always going to be Weist that's just part of the potluck for reverie

2213
02:06:30.610 --> 02:06:34.110
cylindra that you have.
You're gonna have Tesla,
you know,
and,

2214
02:06:34.111 --> 02:06:35.350
and people in the Republican,

2215
02:06:35.351 --> 02:06:38.050
we'd like to bash government spending on the fag or cylinder,

2216
02:06:38.051 --> 02:06:41.440
but they also forget the government funding is my test or an enormous success.

2217
02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:44.430
<v 0>Do you think that a part of what's going on now with the Internet that this</v>

2218
02:06:44.431 --> 02:06:49.431
access to information would also deter at least a certain percentage of waste

2219
02:06:49.861 --> 02:06:53.520
because people will be more responsible for it because it'd be more transparent

2220
02:06:53.700 --> 02:06:54.533
than ever before?

2221
02:06:54.550 --> 02:06:55.600
<v 3>Well,
the stimulus,</v>

2222
02:06:55.601 --> 02:07:00.601
the stimulus was the greatest public stimulus program in US history since FDRS

2223
02:07:01.631 --> 02:07:02.350
new deal.

2224
02:07:02.350 --> 02:07:06.100
But it was also the most transparent spending of public spending with ever seen.

2225
02:07:06.101 --> 02:07:06.501
I mean the,

2226
02:07:06.501 --> 02:07:10.540
the federal government put up a website with every vendor and contractor and

2227
02:07:10.541 --> 02:07:14.080
that,
the details of that available for anyone to say,
I mean,

2228
02:07:14.081 --> 02:07:17.350
the waste of that stimulus,
which wasn't enough,

2229
02:07:17.351 --> 02:07:21.760
the size of the stimulus should have been double the $800 billion at it was,
um,

2230
02:07:22.090 --> 02:07:26.020
it worked.
It added two points to GDP,
created a,
you know,

2231
02:07:26.021 --> 02:07:30.250
a x amount of million public sector,
private sector,
uh,
jobs,

2232
02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:32.260
but it was transparent.

2233
02:07:32.261 --> 02:07:35.140
I don't know how much more transparent it can be even ever say you never to

2234
02:07:35.141 --> 02:07:38.950
eliminate waste.
Totally.
But the offside today it is,
is a,

2235
02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:41.890
it's filled by the private sector and,
and you,
the,
the,

2236
02:07:41.891 --> 02:07:45.850
the alternative is Reagan's Holy Trinity,
you know,
a monopolization,

2237
02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:48.660
um,
um,
uh,

2238
02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:53.520
day deregulation and privatization and you know,
that's great.

2239
02:07:53.521 --> 02:07:57.370
A waste there and more crony capitalism.
Then you have on the other side,

2240
02:07:57.420 --> 02:08:00.630
<v 0>certainly with deregulation,
that's scary shit that people would want that.</v>

2241
02:08:00.631 --> 02:08:02.370
I think that would be a good idea.
Well,

2242
02:08:02.371 --> 02:08:04.110
here's the reason why regulations are in place.

2243
02:08:04.111 --> 02:08:07.650
It's just to keep them from running a muck with natural human instincts of

2244
02:08:07.651 --> 02:08:11.040
conquering natural human instincts of deception.
You know,

2245
02:08:11.041 --> 02:08:14.670
this is just natural things that you have to guard against with laws.

2246
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:18.390
And that's a big corporations and not concern of the common good.

2247
02:08:18.391 --> 02:08:21.260
It's just a profit motive.
And it was machine.
Yeah.
And it,

2248
02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:25.520
<v 3>it was Clinton who deregulated Wall Street wear glass steagall and that led to</v>

2249
02:08:25.521 --> 02:08:29.720
the chain of events which collapsed the entire fucking universe in 2008 dirty

2250
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:33.680
Clinton.
And we haven't had one except for Dodd frank,

2251
02:08:33.681 --> 02:08:37.310
which is a pissy effort to regulate Wall Street.

2252
02:08:37.311 --> 02:08:40.610
Went back to the same place we were leading up to the days of the crash.

2253
02:08:40.611 --> 02:08:41.444
And I white.

2254
02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:45.580
<v 0>What do you think the people that thought that they should let the banks fail?</v>

2255
02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:48.910
Like that's a,
the Peter Schiff idea.
Quite a few people.

2256
02:08:48.911 --> 02:08:52.780
Ron Paul believed that as well.
The film bail out the banks.
Yeah,

2257
02:08:52.781 --> 02:08:55.450
the former Fed chairman Paul Volcker believed the same thing.

2258
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:56.380
What do you think about that?

2259
02:08:56.510 --> 02:09:00.410
<v 3>Well,
you know,
I've,
in my uninformed opinion in it,
there's,</v>

2260
02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:05.560
this is great book called the confidence men and uh,
it's really,
uh,
an insight,

2261
02:09:05.570 --> 02:09:08.990
his account of the Obama White House in the first four years.

2262
02:09:09.370 --> 02:09:11.420
And then obviously as he came into office,

2263
02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:15.440
he was dealing with the biggest economic catastrophe America seen since the

2264
02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:18.080
Great Depression.
And he was listening to all the ideas going forward.

2265
02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:19.940
There was TMA in TB.

2266
02:09:20.270 --> 02:09:25.050
Team B was the likes of Larry Summers.
And Tim if he'd gotten a,
uh,

2267
02:09:25.130 --> 02:09:29.900
and pull Ruben who was a Clintonite in TMA,
was Paul Volcker and so forth.

2268
02:09:30.110 --> 02:09:33.110
Paul Volcker and TMA believed in letting him fail,

2269
02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:36.920
totally get rating of the this debt leverage,
uh,

2270
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:41.330
vehicles that have created this fictitious wealth and fictitious products.

2271
02:09:41.810 --> 02:09:43.670
And the end of Obama went with team B,

2272
02:09:43.671 --> 02:09:45.290
the Larry Summers who were there protect her,

2273
02:09:45.291 --> 02:09:48.980
protect the status quo of Wall Street and you'll have these Wall Street bankers

2274
02:09:48.981 --> 02:09:52.390
led to CEO of Bank of America saying,
thank God,
you know,

2275
02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:55.650
team B was chosen,
was a,
we've never be back to where we were,

2276
02:09:55.651 --> 02:09:58.220
where if we had to let Wall Street file,

2277
02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:03.460
I don't know enough to be able to give a quantified opinion what today would

2278
02:10:04.221 --> 02:10:08.930
look like.
The arguments that you hear while we had to prop them up to,
uh,

2279
02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:14.060
to avoid an even bigger cat cat,
cat,
cat history,
catastrophe,

2280
02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:16.880
same valid as well.
So,
you know,
I don't know,

2281
02:10:18.070 --> 02:10:22.390
<v 0>do you look at the future of this country and think it's going to work out or do</v>

2282
02:10:22.391 --> 02:10:23.350
you look at it and say,

2283
02:10:23.351 --> 02:10:26.290
I'm going back to Australia in about 10 years when the shit hits the fan,

2284
02:10:26.350 --> 02:10:28.780
I think it's almost too light.
Too late.
Yeah.

2285
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:33.140
<v 3>I think where we are today,
what it,
this is what America is going to look like.</v>

2286
02:10:33.141 --> 02:10:36.270
Have you seen the movie?
Uh,
illicium we've met Damon.
Yes.

2287
02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:37.910
That's what America is gonna look like.
Well,

2288
02:10:37.911 --> 02:10:40.400
everyone is going to live in a gated community and space.

2289
02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:43.610
So the rich people were retired behind data communities.
They'll be able to,

2290
02:10:43.611 --> 02:10:46.720
for goods and services which are rest can afford and the rest of America is

2291
02:10:46.730 --> 02:10:51.730
going to leave in a crime riddled a society with no public infrastructure and

2292
02:10:52.581 --> 02:10:56.510
services,
which uh,
you know the ritual have,
you know,
there'll be no middle class,

2293
02:10:57.140 --> 02:11:00.560
which is what third world countries look like really rich top and are really

2294
02:11:00.561 --> 02:11:04.130
poor bottom and nothing in the middle.
But you're fond of statistics.
Yeah.

2295
02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:07.460
<v 2>Don't we have a lower crime,
lower murder rates than ever</v>

2296
02:11:07.530 --> 02:11:12.230
<v 3>before.
[inaudible] matter rights,
uh,
uh,
falling from the height of the,</v>

2297
02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:13.710
the,
the 1980s

2298
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:18.880
<v 2>Gago yeah.
They love the Chicago fucking up the whole curve.
Yeah.</v>

2299
02:11:19.270 --> 02:11:23.100
Bomb town,
goddammit.
Yeah.
Ramming Mag and a total niche.

2300
02:11:23.710 --> 02:11:26.340
People in Chicago,
man,
don't like Obama.
It's amazing.

2301
02:11:27.090 --> 02:11:29.490
Black woman in Chicago was in the news the other day saying he's the worst

2302
02:11:29.491 --> 02:11:30.450
president we've ever had.

2303
02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:34.420
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
A black woman.
Well,
western Bush,
that's something up</v>

2304
02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:39.920
worse than Bush.
Yeah.
I don't know about all that,
but no,
I mean,

2305
02:11:40.450 --> 02:11:43.700
<v 2>if you're a whistleblower,
he's the worst.
Yeah.
Nobody's the West.
Yeah.</v>

2306
02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:47.900
But when you see those statistics,
those numbers,
yeah.

2307
02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:49.960
What makes you think that it's going to get

2308
02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:55.420
<v 3>well,
I mean,
it crime.
Have you,
you have you read freakonomics?
No.
Okay.
I mean,</v>

2309
02:11:55.421 --> 02:11:59.070
it's great book,
Freakonomics and makes a,
uh,
you know,
Carla,
you know,

2310
02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:02.200
causation doesn't improve.
Your correlation,
doesn't prove causation,

2311
02:12:02.201 --> 02:12:02.981
but they make it very,

2312
02:12:02.981 --> 02:12:06.670
a strong argument that the only reason that violent crime has fallen in this

2313
02:12:06.671 --> 02:12:11.140
country is because of Roe v Wade,
Roe v Wade abortion,
you know,

2314
02:12:11.141 --> 02:12:15.370
basically destroyed a whole generation of potential criminals.

2315
02:12:16.030 --> 02:12:20.140
Um,
you know,
we cause it poor communities,
you know,
don't have access to abortion.

2316
02:12:20.141 --> 02:12:24.300
It's so crazy.
I mean it's,
yeah,
this got racist underpinnings that finding but

2317
02:12:24.420 --> 02:12:28.170
<v 2>deep,
deep way.
It's so fucking harsh to get behind.</v>

2318
02:12:28.171 --> 02:12:31.650
But when you look at it scientifically,
if you have just the data to analyze,

2319
02:12:31.651 --> 02:12:32.610
it's really,
yeah.

2320
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:36.230
<v 3>Yeah.
And uh,
but violence is one is,
you know,</v>

2321
02:12:36.231 --> 02:12:38.900
is one aspect that really,
I mean,

2322
02:12:38.901 --> 02:12:42.830
what future is there in America where education becomes unaffordable,

2323
02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:47.070
where those who graduated a saddled with debt that can never get out of,
um,

2324
02:12:47.250 --> 02:12:50.960
and warehousing becomes unaffordable and where there's,
and I will paying jobs,

2325
02:12:50.961 --> 02:12:53.600
we have stagnant wages where you have a,

2326
02:12:53.900 --> 02:12:57.830
a country where income has been totally redistributed to the wolf with a share

2327
02:12:57.831 --> 02:13:02.570
of income is,
you know,
it's what the top 1% used to get 12% of the income.

2328
02:13:02.571 --> 02:13:07.340
Now the top 1% gets something like 37% of the income in this country.
You know,

2329
02:13:07.341 --> 02:13:10.940
you're,
you're creating this massive underclass.
We have no way out.

2330
02:13:11.150 --> 02:13:15.590
So you're saying we need more abortions?
Yeah,
that's what I'm hearing.
Well,

2331
02:13:15.591 --> 02:13:17.960
some people ask me if I'm waiver,
you know,
uh,
you know,

2332
02:13:17.961 --> 02:13:21.010
they obviously know I'm liberal.
They asked me if I'm a pro choice and I say,
no,

2333
02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:22.920
I'm not pro choice and pro abortion.
That's a big deal.

2334
02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:25.920
<v 2>Sure.
Well,</v>

2335
02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:29.250
I wish it did involve killing a fetus.

2336
02:13:29.670 --> 02:13:32.070
The reality of what abortion is is

2337
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.230
<v 0>something that people don't want to discuss.</v>

2338
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:37.830
I've had these conversations with people who are liberal and uh,

2339
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:41.220
just when you talk about it flat objectively,
no dot.

2340
02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:43.830
No ideology attach what is going on?
Well,
there's a,

2341
02:13:43.850 --> 02:13:46.890
there's a person that's growing in a body and we snuff it out.

2342
02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:51.570
And at what point in time is it okay to snuffing out?
I mean,

2343
02:13:51.590 --> 02:13:54.990
it is that,
that's what it is.
I mean,
is it okay a weekend?
Yeah,

2344
02:13:54.991 --> 02:13:59.100
it's bunch of cells.
Is it okay?
Six weeks in,
things don't get squirrely.

2345
02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:01.080
You start getting squirrely when you see fingers.

2346
02:14:01.110 --> 02:14:04.020
He started seeing ahead and little feat.
It starts having a heartbeat.

2347
02:14:04.021 --> 02:14:06.720
When's it a person?
It's only a person was born really?

2348
02:14:06.721 --> 02:14:10.710
So at nine month old baby that hasn't been born yet,
you can reach in,

2349
02:14:10.711 --> 02:14:14.820
suck that baby out with a vacuum.
And that's groovy man.
Well,
when is it,

2350
02:14:14.850 --> 02:14:18.520
when it's viable outside the womb?
I mean it's,
it's very well they get in,

2351
02:14:18.530 --> 02:14:20.150
they get thrown.
Is it,
is it viable?

2352
02:14:20.151 --> 02:14:24.020
And then you write in the right and SAS the equation as well.
Oh sure.
Yeah.

2353
02:14:24.070 --> 02:14:24.840
I mean,
so,

2354
02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:29.160
and isn't one of those things like many things in this world where there isn't a

2355
02:14:29.161 --> 02:14:33.660
clean cut,
black or white,
there are many,
many shades of gray.

2356
02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:37.600
And I,
you know,
and I,
I,
I'm believing,
I joke about my pro abortion calling,

2357
02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:42.500
but the,
uh,
how dare you,
they joke about something so important.
Yeah.

2358
02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:46.370
I mean,
it's a very emotionally it contentious minefield are riddled,
you know,

2359
02:14:47.210 --> 02:14:49.740
one that women,
you know,
rightly so,

2360
02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:54.330
take umbrage with men being able to decide what they can and can't do with their

2361
02:14:54.331 --> 02:14:58.680
body.
I'm not trying to decide and I most certainly am pro choice as far as how I

2362
02:14:58.681 --> 02:15:02.310
vote.
But when I look at the reality of what an abortion is,
I,

2363
02:15:02.311 --> 02:15:07.311
it disturbs me that because of ideology and because of the stance that they take

2364
02:15:07.501 --> 02:15:08.280
left or right,

2365
02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:12.990
that people will argue against the reality of what an abortion is.

2366
02:15:13.020 --> 02:15:16.060
And I think when you do that,
you'd do a disservice to the topic.
Sure.

2367
02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:19.050
It's a tricky situation and you're killing babies.
I mean,

2368
02:15:19.051 --> 02:15:22.070
there's no way abortion is a tragedy no matter which way you cut it.

2369
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:25.440
You're then have to deal sensibly with the tragedy that,

2370
02:15:25.470 --> 02:15:28.830
and unless you had a one night stand with a crazy bitch and she says,

2371
02:15:28.831 --> 02:15:31.750
don't worry,
I'm getting an abortion and then it's fine.
Amanda.

2372
02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:36.590
Or if you're listening dot Colby time to party.
Yeah.
Um,

2373
02:15:37.020 --> 02:15:38.970
I wish it was a better way.
You know,

2374
02:15:38.971 --> 02:15:42.210
wish she was a way that you could immediately,
you know,
there was really,

2375
02:15:42.211 --> 02:15:45.990
I have a joke about this,
that it should be a better way to make people than sex.

2376
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:47.430
I mean,
at one point in time,

2377
02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:50.400
maybe that's what the aliens are all about because when you see the aliens,

2378
02:15:50.401 --> 02:15:52.140
they're always sexless.
Right.

2379
02:15:52.141 --> 02:15:55.830
They always have the smooth bodies and they have no muscles because they use

2380
02:15:55.831 --> 02:15:57.360
their brains to move things around.

2381
02:15:57.720 --> 02:15:59.880
They probably got to a certain point in time and they realize,
listen,

2382
02:15:59.881 --> 02:16:03.810
we're not going to evolve unless we get rid of these animal instincts to breed

2383
02:16:04.020 --> 02:16:05.490
and conquer and dominate.

2384
02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:09.780
And the only way we're going to move to this really Utopian society concept that

2385
02:16:09.781 --> 02:16:11.400
everybody has.
You know,
we,

2386
02:16:11.401 --> 02:16:14.820
the gradiations the steps away from being an animal,

2387
02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:19.860
from being violent Predator to being some enlightened being somewhere along the

2388
02:16:19.861 --> 02:16:21.780
line you're going to have to get rid of sex.
Well,

2389
02:16:21.781 --> 02:16:25.200
you can a Jackie light into a baker.
But I mean,
I don't mean to brag.

2390
02:16:25.201 --> 02:16:26.430
That's really hard to get it in there.

2391
02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:31.380
I'm saying hitting the walls and through genetic manipulation would be produced

2392
02:16:31.381 --> 02:16:33.790
through cloning.
We produced.
Yeah,
I mean we're already doing that.

2393
02:16:33.970 --> 02:16:36.640
If we could all become Unix,
I think the world would be a better place.

2394
02:16:36.730 --> 02:16:40.710
I'm not saying that sex is bad.
Sex is awesome.
The,
the,

2395
02:16:40.730 --> 02:16:43.060
the sexual differences between men and women.

2396
02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:47.650
Men and women are a fascinating dynamic that I think fuels passion and poetry

2397
02:16:47.651 --> 02:16:49.870
and light,
not poetry.
I never fuck a read poetry on,

2398
02:16:49.890 --> 02:16:54.400
you know what I'm talking about art.
There's a lot of good to that struggle.

2399
02:16:54.490 --> 02:16:56.530
There's a lot of great things that come out of struggle,

2400
02:16:56.770 --> 02:17:01.770
but there's also the reality that if you had to extrapolate from here forth from

2401
02:17:02.351 --> 02:17:06.280
where we are to what we used to be.
If you believe in evolution,

2402
02:17:06.340 --> 02:17:07.173
if you're one of them,

2403
02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:11.140
if you want to go back to the times where we were fucking living in caves and

2404
02:17:11.141 --> 02:17:16.141
fighting off t rex or whatever the hell was going on and extrapolate that a

2405
02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:18.520
thousand years in the future,
10,000 years,
the future,
at some point in time,

2406
02:17:18.850 --> 02:17:23.050
the elimination of sexual urges might be imperative.
Yeah,

2407
02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.900
<v 3>I mean it's a,
that's how most base or agenda,</v>

2408
02:17:26.970 --> 02:17:30.600
you know David Suzuki a environmentalist set up best.

2409
02:17:30.601 --> 02:17:35.070
He said as advances,
we become technologically and if you look at the infant,

2410
02:17:35.071 --> 02:17:38.640
we created this information superhighway and we fought.

2411
02:17:38.641 --> 02:17:40.830
This is going to change the world and change your university.

2412
02:17:40.831 --> 02:17:45.430
Yet 85% of the content and they was pulling the five.
Is it that high?

2413
02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:47.820
I don't know.
I might've made another statistic.
I'll bet it's high.

2414
02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:50.760
It think it's pretty high.
We've looked at it before.

2415
02:17:50.761 --> 02:17:53.250
I think there's varying numbers,
but I think I heard that then.
I actually,

2416
02:17:53.251 --> 02:17:54.031
the number,
it was a,

2417
02:17:54.031 --> 02:17:57.120
I think it was 65% I think I might have added to it to for graduate emphasis

2418
02:17:57.590 --> 02:18:01.430
<v 0>37.
Let's,
let's find out right now what percentage of the Internet is porn?</v>

2419
02:18:01.431 --> 02:18:05.660
Here we go.
What are you going to say?
60 60%.
Okay.
What?
Uh,

2420
02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:06.710
of the Internet.

2421
02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:10.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2422
02:18:10.290 --> 02:18:11.880
<v 0>Okay.
Let's find out here.</v>

2423
02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:16.640
How much of the Internet is actually porn on Forbes?
It says,

2424
02:18:16.650 --> 02:18:20.190
don't make me click some shit to continue to the next site.
Goddammit.

2425
02:18:21.630 --> 02:18:25.560
Yeah,
probably you porn.
Not that I know what that is.
That's a bad place.

2426
02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:30.030
Um hmm.
It says,

2427
02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:32.580
okay.
In 2010,

2428
02:18:32.581 --> 02:18:36.510
13% of web searches were for erotic content.

2429
02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:42.360
Only 4% of the top million websites.
Huh?

2430
02:18:42.730 --> 02:18:45.850
So 4% but the was the volume.
This fucking,

2431
02:18:45.851 --> 02:18:48.370
they're fucking around with numbers here.
Give me the volume bitches.

2432
02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:51.940
They're not giving me the volume right off the bat.
That's not this one.

2433
02:18:51.970 --> 02:18:56.380
Forbes is hiding information.
Goddamn elitists.
Web Porn.

2434
02:18:56.381 --> 02:19:00.520
Just how much is there?
37% that was right.
Yeah.
If I a 7% yeah,

2435
02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:05.050
I swear it is 37% that was the number 30 per seven.

2436
02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:09.760
7% of the Internet is made of pornographic material,
man.
That's,

2437
02:19:10.180 --> 02:19:13.300
wow.
It's still high.
That's pretty high.
Yeah.
Nutty.

2438
02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:17.350
According to estimates from a Scandinavian research,

2439
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:22.830
90% of all the data the human race has ever produced has been generated in the

2440
02:19:23.621 --> 02:19:28.110
past two years.
Whoa.
Wow.
That's,
wow.

2441
02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:31.220
That is fucking banana.
That's crazier than porn.

2442
02:19:32.260 --> 02:19:37.190
I can jerk off to 90% of the date of the human race has ever produced,

2443
02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:41.360
has been generated in the past two years.
Wow.
Well,

2444
02:19:41.361 --> 02:19:43.340
how much of that is just bullshit on Twitter and

2445
02:19:43.850 --> 02:19:45.770
<v 3>I couldn't try remember reading something like that.</v>

2446
02:19:45.771 --> 02:19:47.850
Something like 80% of man's knowledge,

2447
02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:53.140
everything that man knows has been acquired since 1969 the year we landed on the

2448
02:19:53.330 --> 02:19:56.870
moon.
That's always possible.
It's always thrown about.

2449
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:59.340
<v 0>How could that be possible in the Bible is 2000 years old.</v>

2450
02:19:59.341 --> 02:20:02.670
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about sun ever.
That's weird.

2451
02:20:02.671 --> 02:20:06.870
Everything we know is from 1969 Ford is that,
but it's sort of been,

2452
02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:09.450
yeah,
it must be 80 odd percent.
That makes sense.

2453
02:20:09.451 --> 02:20:12.710
Cause it's everything is built upon,
you know,
the,

2454
02:20:12.711 --> 02:20:15.900
the mean you needed the infrastructure of a hunting.
You know,

2455
02:20:15.901 --> 02:20:19.110
you needed the people to figure out the combustion engine for them to figure out

2456
02:20:19.111 --> 02:20:19.944
the electric car.

2457
02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:21.910
<v 3>What was only a hundred a hundred years before that.</v>

2458
02:20:21.911 --> 02:20:26.250
We forward if someone had the flu,
I meant that would demonically possessed.
Yeah.

2459
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:28.063
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,</v>

2460
02:20:28.530 --> 02:20:33.530
does the numbers are pretty crazy when you look at 90% of all the data over two

2461
02:20:33.951 --> 02:20:34.440
years,

2462
02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:38.300
what is it going to be two years from now then when you look at that exponential

2463
02:20:38.301 --> 02:20:41.900
increase in technology?
I'm,
I'm hopeful.
You know,

2464
02:20:41.901 --> 02:20:46.820
I don't think that you or your vision of Elysium is going to come to pass.

2465
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:51.380
I'm,
but I'm an optimist,
you know?
Are you an optimist?
Are you a pessimist?

2466
02:20:51.580 --> 02:20:54.940
<v 3>Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
She lost friends.</v>

2467
02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:59.260
I'm a glass half full kind of guy.
Uh,
and uh,

2468
02:20:59.261 --> 02:21:01.990
I mean I have the advantage of,
of,
of being here and I know when,

2469
02:21:02.110 --> 02:21:04.080
when things really do it get to the shit.
I just got them

2470
02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:07.430
<v 0>plan to get back to us,
strike up where we have universal health care.</v>

2471
02:21:07.431 --> 02:21:10.510
I really don't trust and pensions and social security and so he can't be

2472
02:21:10.511 --> 02:21:11.890
president.
[inaudible] son of a bitch.

2473
02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:16.970
<v 3>Uh,
I'm,
I'm pessimistic.
Uh,
uh,
until uh,</v>

2474
02:21:16.971 --> 02:21:21.020
the lube liberal class in his country becomes a force again.
Um,

2475
02:21:21.050 --> 02:21:25.340
because there is no counter veiling power to capital in this country at the

2476
02:21:25.341 --> 02:21:26.174
moment

2477
02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:31.560
<v 0>until the liberal class becomes a force again.</v>

2478
02:21:31.710 --> 02:21:36.680
What are the detriments though of having liberals in control?
Well,
pussies.

2479
02:21:36.690 --> 02:21:37.523
That's what the Dutch,

2480
02:21:37.690 --> 02:21:40.590
the fucking alcaide is going to come over here and kick our ass.

2481
02:21:40.970 --> 02:21:43.900
A bunch of panty waist running this land.
How are you Jay?

2482
02:21:43.901 --> 02:21:45.750
You were Clinton love blowing shit up.
You know,

2483
02:21:46.540 --> 02:21:49.500
only blue shit up when he get caught getting blowjobs.
That's it.

2484
02:21:49.501 --> 02:21:52.950
He really like blowing shit up.
Remember that?
Oh yeah.
Son of a bitch.

2485
02:21:52.951 --> 02:21:56.890
Of all the women he could have had.
He probably had a lot of them.
It is.

2486
02:21:57.120 --> 02:21:58.860
We found out about a mouthy fat girl

2487
02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:05.700
in more ways than one.
I mean,
didn't he supposedly Bang Elizabeth Hurley?

2488
02:22:05.701 --> 02:22:09.060
Do you see all those photographs that came out recently?
Oh really?
Oh this one.

2489
02:22:09.061 --> 02:22:13.170
Look at him and her looking at each other.
But you know,
you just know.

2490
02:22:14.730 --> 02:22:17.070
But she's a good girl.
She keeps a secret.
A lover.

2491
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.711
<v 3>What did,</v>

2492
02:22:17.711 --> 02:22:22.711
she is actually a engaged to one of Australia's greatest cricketers ever.

2493
02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:26.490
Really?
I Shane Warne.
How old is she?
I ain't going to get,

2494
02:22:26.491 --> 02:22:30.630
she's early forties hanging in there,
Huh?
Yeah.
Barely.
Yeah,

2495
02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:33.480
tooth and claw.
I'd do her.
Would you really?

2496
02:22:33.770 --> 02:22:38.590
How dare you do that Mormon broad too.
He just horny man.
Goddammit.

2497
02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:43.890
So you,
but what are the,
what are the negative aspects of liberals?
Well,
you know,

2498
02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:50.060
nothing is a solution.
You know,
there's no one size fits all,
obviously.
Right.

2499
02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:55.350
And you know,
I've,
I think that countries struggle for,
we've trial and error.

2500
02:22:55.410 --> 02:22:57.800
I think that,
you know,
what's happening in Australia,
in Germany,
and I said,

2501
02:22:57.801 --> 02:23:00.040
these is not pure liberal societies at all.
They've,

2502
02:23:00.330 --> 02:23:05.190
it's a balancing act always between liberalism and capitalism.
Um,

2503
02:23:05.220 --> 02:23:10.220
and I think there's countries that juggle two balls better at the moment.

2504
02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:14.910
It's so lopsided in the fire of Capitol,
capitol,
Trump's politics.

2505
02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:19.320
Um,
you know,
that it's,
you know,
from 19,
you know,

2506
02:23:19.350 --> 02:23:23.160
it all started in this country,
and not to get too historical,
but,
uh,

2507
02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:26.810
justice pal,
uh,
wrote a memo,
um,

2508
02:23:26.820 --> 02:23:30.720
when Nixon was in the White House and said that the sleeping giant in American

2509
02:23:30.721 --> 02:23:35.160
politics is a,
is the CEO of America.
And from that point on,

2510
02:23:35.161 --> 02:23:36.540
that memo turned into the,

2511
02:23:36.650 --> 02:23:41.260
the greatest migration of a Wall Street lobbyists for what?

2512
02:23:41.420 --> 02:23:43.650
Migration from Wall Street to Washington.
And,

2513
02:23:44.010 --> 02:23:48.480
and today you have something like 50 odd thousand lobbyists in Washington and

2514
02:23:48.481 --> 02:23:52.770
have the years of politicians.
So,
uh,
liberalism has an our chance.
And again,

2515
02:23:52.890 --> 02:23:54.270
if liberalism had a chance,

2516
02:23:54.271 --> 02:23:57.290
we would have had universal healthcare when the Democrats had unilateral control

2517
02:23:57.300 --> 02:24:02.240
the Congress.
But we didn't,
we ended up with a,
a very capitalistic solution,
uh,

2518
02:24:02.310 --> 02:24:03.420
to a health care problems.

2519
02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:09.060
But what would fuck up if liberals ran things?
Will it be the real big issue?

2520
02:24:09.690 --> 02:24:14.220
Well,
what fucked up when FDR was empowered for all those years so long ago,

2521
02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:17.700
there's a different world that's like talking about it and culture that's,

2522
02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:18.091
you know,

2523
02:24:18.091 --> 02:24:22.080
aboriginal culture that had some sort of collective government and comparing it

2524
02:24:22.081 --> 02:24:25.140
to ours.
It's so different.
Some of my friends are aboriginals.

2525
02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:29.050
I'm sure there's a log with your gay friends,
you Christian.

2526
02:24:31.770 --> 02:24:36.030
I mean,
what,
what would be the negative,
I mean,

2527
02:24:36.031 --> 02:24:40.400
would there be any negative,
any weakening of this great nation by having,
uh,

2528
02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:44.400
like a real liberal idealist?
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,

2529
02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:47.280
you've got to give it a go or die.
You've got to go back.

2530
02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:51.180
You've got to go back to what's worked and liberalism has worked or it's a

2531
02:24:51.181 --> 02:24:55.350
proven success in a free market.
Capitalism hasn't worked in this country.

2532
02:24:55.351 --> 02:25:00.220
We know at a trickle down economics hasn't worked.
Again Kansas if the need you,

2533
02:25:00.410 --> 02:25:02.940
George Bush came into Pat George,
Bill Clinton,

2534
02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:08.100
a Rice Texas on the rich three times created 23 million jobs.
George Bush,

2535
02:25:08.130 --> 02:25:08.370
you know,

2536
02:25:08.370 --> 02:25:12.630
came into power putting the biggest tax cuts on the wealthy since World War Two

2537
02:25:13.020 --> 02:25:15.210
and had a net loss of one main jobs.

2538
02:25:15.211 --> 02:25:18.930
Not including even if taking out the years of the great recession and the great

2539
02:25:18.931 --> 02:25:22.110
crash at a consideration.
We see it happening in Kansas,

2540
02:25:22.470 --> 02:25:24.430
that free market capitalism,

2541
02:25:24.431 --> 02:25:28.510
trickle down economics mantra just has been an abject failure wherever it's been

2542
02:25:28.511 --> 02:25:32.170
tried.
So is it liberalism going to be the perfect answer?
No,

2543
02:25:32.171 --> 02:25:35.050
but there has to be some,
some measure where we,

2544
02:25:35.051 --> 02:25:37.150
the corporate state is putting in control.

2545
02:25:37.470 --> 02:25:41.130
<v 0>But if you did Vincent liberalism gets into power and then you know,</v>

2546
02:25:41.131 --> 02:25:44.750
this sort of antiwar sentiment gets firmly put into place.

2547
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:48.590
What do you do about the vacuum that's created in these a hundred different

2548
02:25:48.591 --> 02:25:51.320
countries where we have military presence.

2549
02:25:51.790 --> 02:25:55.170
If FDR was a liberal and we went into World War II,
right,

2550
02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:58.340
but there was a different world,
right?
I mean,
wasn't in a different world.

2551
02:25:58.370 --> 02:26:02.150
Not really.
I mean,
we know he's no terrorists.
It was clear enemies.

2552
02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:04.340
We were drafting the Nazis and you know,
there was,

2553
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:08.690
it was sort of a different time.
Well more clearly defined.

2554
02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:12.390
<v 3>The Middle East is no problem in the Middle East that's going to be solved with</v>

2555
02:26:12.391 --> 02:26:13.440
military intervention.

2556
02:26:13.470 --> 02:26:17.190
I may in Iraq is purely a political situation and you're not going to quell the

2557
02:26:17.191 --> 02:26:18.570
violence by putting,
look,

2558
02:26:18.571 --> 02:26:23.520
we couldn't stop an insurgency in Iraq when we had 150,000 troops on the ground.

2559
02:26:23.910 --> 02:26:26.430
Now with sending height hundred military advisors,

2560
02:26:26.431 --> 02:26:29.460
what the fuck is that going to do?
So,
you know,
Syria,

2561
02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:33.380
you're not going to stop it unless you know these,
these borders were redrawn.

2562
02:26:33.390 --> 02:26:36.890
So if isolationism,
uh,
you could argue,
well,
it,

2563
02:26:36.891 --> 02:26:40.820
how's isolation isn't gonna hurt when there is no military solution days.

2564
02:26:40.990 --> 02:26:42.960
Today's a geopolitical problems.

2565
02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:45.410
<v 0>Well,
the idea of the military solution is the suppression.</v>

2566
02:26:45.700 --> 02:26:47.630
If we're not solving it,

2567
02:26:47.631 --> 02:26:52.631
at least we're suppressing the power from gathering steam and forcing them.

2568
02:26:53.860 --> 02:26:54.141
You know,

2569
02:26:54.141 --> 02:26:57.470
there was some situation where they could collectively formed some large

2570
02:26:57.471 --> 02:27:01.940
threatening group that were dissipating that in some sense by our military

2571
02:27:01.941 --> 02:27:06.050
presence in these countries that are our foot on their neck is what keeping them

2572
02:27:06.051 --> 02:27:10.220
from growing large and then fighting over there so you don't have to fly it over

2573
02:27:10.221 --> 02:27:13.130
here.
So we're going to have freedom over here.
I mean that's the logic behind it,

2574
02:27:13.131 --> 02:27:13.460
right?
Yeah.

2575
02:27:13.460 --> 02:27:15.860
<v 3>But we couldn't do with 150,000 troops.
So how,</v>

2576
02:27:15.930 --> 02:27:18.620
so how many trips do you want to keep in these countries?

2577
02:27:18.621 --> 02:27:22.870
For how long does it become like an endless occupation and all are in every hot

2578
02:27:22.871 --> 02:27:23.720
spot around the world?

2579
02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:28.030
<v 0>Well,
I mean,
I don't think that's a good idea,
but it seems to be what it is.
Yeah.</v>

2580
02:27:28.031 --> 02:27:29.680
I mean it seems to be what we're doing.

2581
02:27:29.980 --> 02:27:33.340
<v 3>Yeah.
Well not well.
I think Obama's,
I mean you look,</v>

2582
02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:37.570
you look at all the geopolitical issues which come up in the last few years,

2583
02:27:37.571 --> 02:27:41.260
everything from Syria to Olivia to Russia to now Iraq.

2584
02:27:41.470 --> 02:27:45.130
The Republican's have plated Obama to get military involved in all four of these

2585
02:27:45.131 --> 02:27:48.250
situations.
Three of us situations aren't even in the news anymore.

2586
02:27:48.490 --> 02:27:53.050
And we would have had a military foresee.
Um,
so you know,

2587
02:27:53.051 --> 02:27:55.570
I think the,
the Obama doctrine for lack of a,
you know,
I,

2588
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:59.290
I know he doesn't like calling Obama doctrine.
It's working.
It's,
you know,

2589
02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:04.210
stand on the sidelines,
use proxies,
done,
put boots on the ground,

2590
02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:08.890
look for political situation,
political,
um,
uh,
uh,

2591
02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:11.640
avenues,
whether it's through sanctions or,
uh,

2592
02:28:11.650 --> 02:28:14.830
pressure on currencies and so forth.
These things work.

2593
02:28:14.831 --> 02:28:16.720
The reason Russia is withdrawing from the,

2594
02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:21.230
the eastern borders of Ukraine is because they sanctions have crippled the

2595
02:28:21.231 --> 02:28:24.640
oligarchs in Russia and they're putting turn,
putting pressure on Putin to,

2596
02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:25.850
to withdraw.

2597
02:28:25.850 --> 02:28:29.230
<v 0>Has It really worked?
There's a lot of people that would argue it hasn't.</v>

2598
02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:31.850
And then Obama's policies had been disastrous.
I mean,

2599
02:28:31.851 --> 02:28:34.190
there was an article in politico recently,
I don't know if you read it,

2600
02:28:34.191 --> 02:28:37.670
it was the man who broke the Middle East was this figure a,

2601
02:28:37.671 --> 02:28:40.970
this picture of a pensive Obama like looking old as fuck.

2602
02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:44.900
But if anybody's hit the wall like age while they've been in office,

2603
02:28:44.901 --> 02:28:49.610
that poor bastard who knows what kind of pressure and stress they must be under

2604
02:28:49.611 --> 02:28:54.530
to be in that position.
I mean,
I can't even imagine why anybody would want that.

2605
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:59.690
But this guy,
Elliott Abrams,
wrote this article about the,
the policies and what,

2606
02:28:59.750 --> 02:29:03.230
what it's done to the Middle East and how fucked up things are.
Now.

2607
02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:06.400
A lot of people don't think that the policies work and they think that if

2608
02:29:06.401 --> 02:29:08.990
they've created more problems than they've solved.

2609
02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:14.010
<v 3>Yeah.
Well,
I mean,
how's it,
I mean,
we broke Iraq.
Uh,
I mean,</v>

2610
02:29:14.270 --> 02:29:17.900
the Republicans like to be revisionist at the moment and say that things are all

2611
02:29:17.901 --> 02:29:22.830
rosy when we drew in 2008,
or is it our nine?
If things with,

2612
02:29:22.850 --> 02:29:26.960
there was a civil war raging,
they're still,
um,
and you know,

2613
02:29:26.961 --> 02:29:31.730
last year there was an on average 800 to a thousand Iraqis killed in terrorist

2614
02:29:31.731 --> 02:29:36.470
attacks each month.
Uh,
in that place,
the civil war's been raging.
Um,

2615
02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:41.030
putting military intervention doesn't solve that.
Um,
we have to,

2616
02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:45.340
we have to ava put pressure on the Iraqi government on Maliqi to,
uh,

2617
02:29:45.470 --> 02:29:50.360
to be more inclusive.
I mean,
we fucked the pooch when the day I,
you know,

2618
02:29:50.361 --> 02:29:51.580
I got friends who,
uh,

2619
02:29:51.620 --> 02:29:55.160
who worked a security contract is friends who worked for Global Corp,

2620
02:29:55.161 --> 02:29:58.100
who were in charge of monitoring the Green Zone during the early days of the

2621
02:29:58.101 --> 02:30:00.470
occupation in Iraq.
And I said,

2622
02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:03.230
after off the decide I'm statue fell in Baghdad,

2623
02:30:03.231 --> 02:30:07.490
you could walk freely without a sidearm even anywhere in Baghdad in those early

2624
02:30:07.490 --> 02:30:11.660
days.
But the main,
the minute that Bremner and Co and um,
uh,

2625
02:30:11.690 --> 02:30:15.830
deep Bafa sized or you know,
sec office out of the police force in the military,

2626
02:30:15.831 --> 02:30:17.690
that created a civil war.
From that point on,

2627
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:21.650
now we put Maliki and POW or we endorse Maliki in the power and he's just

2628
02:30:21.651 --> 02:30:25.450
perpetuated that policy of,
you know,
she is only in the sewage.

2629
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:26.720
Soon he's become the on the cloth.

2630
02:30:26.721 --> 02:30:28.610
So it doesn't matter how many people we put there,

2631
02:30:28.611 --> 02:30:29.570
it's not going to solve the problem.

2632
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:33.080
<v 2>What solves the problem?
How do we fix the world?
Dude,
we,
you know,</v>

2633
02:30:33.290 --> 02:30:34.970
one of the problems with these conversations.

2634
02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.340
I love these conversations but I also hate them.

2635
02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:40.220
I love them cause they're fascinating.
They're stimulating,

2636
02:30:40.370 --> 02:30:44.470
but it certain point in time we have them and I go this,
we just see we didn't,

2637
02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:46.550
we're not getting anything done here.
Nothing's changing.

2638
02:30:46.850 --> 02:30:50.780
We just mentally masturbating and then leave and it all stays the same.

2639
02:30:51.170 --> 02:30:52.590
And there's intellectual

2640
02:30:52.730 --> 02:30:55.580
<v 3>conversations always end up circular ladder.
I mean,
yeah,</v>

2641
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:59.180
if you're going to ask me if,
if to be a prick for a minute,

2642
02:30:59.450 --> 02:31:04.450
I would say the solution is we put in another heavy autocratic regime that

2643
02:31:04.521 --> 02:31:05.354
suppresses

2644
02:31:05.530 --> 02:31:08.510
<v 2>lodged headspins the population.
Now Muslims,
again,</v>

2645
02:31:08.511 --> 02:31:12.220
I'll be sending me death rates now,
but that's what America has done.

2646
02:31:12.221 --> 02:31:14.860
If you want peace in the Middle East and then we need to prop up autocratic

2647
02:31:14.861 --> 02:31:15.694
regimes,

2648
02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:19.440
it's different than any other part of the world because they're not countries in

2649
02:31:19.441 --> 02:31:20.070
the way that we

2650
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.350
<v 3>think of him as countries is artificial countries.</v>

2651
02:31:22.351 --> 02:31:26.490
It's the same reason that Yugoslavia blew up because we told you the Bosnians

2652
02:31:26.491 --> 02:31:29.910
and the Croatians and the Serbs here,
here's your country.

2653
02:31:29.911 --> 02:31:32.730
Pretend to like each other get along and Galveston as a single country,

2654
02:31:32.731 --> 02:31:36.150
but there are different people.
Iraq is three different countries under one,

2655
02:31:36.151 --> 02:31:39.820
but we're telling them we've British borders to get along nicely and to,
uh,

2656
02:31:40.010 --> 02:31:43.530
to treat each other equally in a demic under a democratic government.

2657
02:31:43.531 --> 02:31:45.930
When in these countries,
I don't even know what democracy is.

2658
02:31:46.780 --> 02:31:51.400
<v 0>Can they be taught?
I mean,
wasn't Iraq real country at one point in time?
I mean,</v>

2659
02:31:51.401 --> 02:31:52.900
there's some that argue that our rack,

2660
02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:57.580
that Baghdad hasn't been the same since Kingus Khan invaded and the 12 hundreds

2661
02:31:57.850 --> 02:31:58.950
that that fucked up,
that,

2662
02:31:58.960 --> 02:32:02.620
I mean they killed everybody in Baghdad and like 1220 or whatever it was.

2663
02:32:02.970 --> 02:32:04.870
And that the country is literally never right.

2664
02:32:05.340 --> 02:32:09.580
<v 3>Recovered.
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,
if you want to involuntary,
you just go,</v>

2665
02:32:09.581 --> 02:32:13.270
you get your draw a big circle and say let's she a stone and you draw another

2666
02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:13.921
big circling.

2667
02:32:13.921 --> 02:32:17.100
I say that Sunni Stein now getting your corners and state the fuck there.

2668
02:32:17.101 --> 02:32:18.300
And that's the end of it really.

2669
02:32:18.360 --> 02:32:20.880
<v 0>But then they only gonna say,
you know,
I like it over there.</v>

2670
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:24.350
<v 3>Yeah.
And then the Saudis and the Guy Go,
what?
We've got so much money and wealth,</v>

2671
02:32:24.351 --> 02:32:26.900
we don't want to share it with anyone else in.
The Iranians are going to go,

2672
02:32:26.901 --> 02:32:29.240
well we have so much money and wealth,
we're not going to share with you.

2673
02:32:29.300 --> 02:32:32.570
They just Porsche your populations,
let Syria and uh,
you know,

2674
02:32:32.571 --> 02:32:33.530
in the south of Iraq,

2675
02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:38.510
<v 0>isn't that going to be just another Israel Palestine type situation living right</v>

2676
02:32:38.511 --> 02:32:41.750
next door to people you hate that look exactly like you.

2677
02:32:41.860 --> 02:32:43.930
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean,
bottom line that region is fuck,</v>

2678
02:32:43.960 --> 02:32:45.220
maybe we should just note the whole yeah,

2679
02:32:45.250 --> 02:32:50.080
<v 0>courageous.
Put a massive burger king there.
I would go with in and out,</v>

2680
02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:52.870
but I see what you're saying.
Yeah.
Fuck man.

2681
02:32:52.930 --> 02:32:55.180
That's the problem with these conversations.

2682
02:32:55.181 --> 02:32:58.080
They always hit this point where you go,
okay,
well what,
what,
what,

2683
02:32:58.090 --> 02:33:01.570
what can be done?
And the answer is almost always does no answer.

2684
02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:05.020
<v 3>Yeah.
And the only answer is asked to stay the fuck out of air and just put,</v>

2685
02:33:05.050 --> 02:33:06.210
let you know our,

2686
02:33:06.410 --> 02:33:10.610
our ally there is one of the most oppressive autocratic regimes in the world,

2687
02:33:10.611 --> 02:33:13.370
Saudi Arabia.
Um,
you know,

2688
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:17.870
if we don't support them,
the price of oil will have oil shock.

2689
02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:21.050
The American economy,
it would be doomed even more.
I mean,
we're,

2690
02:33:21.290 --> 02:33:25.130
we're sitting on such a precipice of potential disaster is ridiculous.

2691
02:33:25.131 --> 02:33:28.220
If the price of oil skyrockets,
Japan is fucked.

2692
02:33:28.221 --> 02:33:32.510
Japan is so dependent on US keeping US America keeping the price of oil down

2693
02:33:32.780 --> 02:33:34.770
because they have no oil of their own.
I mean,

2694
02:33:34.850 --> 02:33:36.740
oil guests scarred through the roof.
I mean,

2695
02:33:36.741 --> 02:33:38.870
not only are we to have problems in the middle [inaudible] we're going to have a

2696
02:33:38.871 --> 02:33:39.950
worldwide catastrophe.
Right?

2697
02:33:40.060 --> 02:33:43.500
<v 0>That's why we need fracking needs,
support Franken,</v>

2698
02:33:43.630 --> 02:33:46.930
all these assholes that are worried about their wells getting poised and you go

2699
02:33:46.931 --> 02:33:49.570
to Walmart,
you buy your water like everybody else.

2700
02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:56.160
Do you get any hope at all when you see a situation like with what happened with

2701
02:33:56.711 --> 02:34:00.640
Syria where the United States at a press conference,

2702
02:34:00.641 --> 02:34:05.470
Obama got on television,
military action against Syria was inevitable.

2703
02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:09.880
Everybody just said,
fuck this.
The whole country collectively,

2704
02:34:09.881 --> 02:34:13.480
right and left was like,
get the fuck Outta here with this.
And then it went away.

2705
02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:15.190
Yeah,
he went away.
We have,
I mean,

2706
02:34:15.191 --> 02:34:18.670
do you remember that speech that speech seemed we were on the verge of war.

2707
02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:23.440
The Red Line space?
Yeah.
Where,
where,
where,
where's it a short attention span.

2708
02:34:23.490 --> 02:34:25.270
Yeah.
We'll go just short attention spans.

2709
02:34:25.271 --> 02:34:28.000
But the government recognized that there was a huge resistance.

2710
02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:31.570
That might be the straw that breaks the camel's back.
That might give birth too.

2711
02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:35.680
Not just a occupy Wall Street,
but something global.

2712
02:34:35.890 --> 02:34:39.130
Something where people really did step in and say this,

2713
02:34:39.131 --> 02:34:42.310
you guys are fucking crazy and you guys are making the whole world a dangerous,

2714
02:34:42.311 --> 02:34:44.530
scary place and we're not buying it anymore.

2715
02:34:44.650 --> 02:34:48.250
<v 3>Yeah.
And also again,
as Assad as big of a prick your ears.
Well,</v>

2716
02:34:48.251 --> 02:34:51.660
what's the alternative is could be worse.
I mean,
you got foreign fighters,

2717
02:34:51.670 --> 02:34:55.390
Islamist groups that,
uh,
want to turn Syria into a theocracy.

2718
02:34:55.630 --> 02:34:59.890
Lisa side is bad as he is as a secularist,
you know,
and that's,
you know,

2719
02:34:59.891 --> 02:35:04.030
it wasn't Saddam Hussein.
A second set of the sign was a secularist.
Baghdadi,

2720
02:35:04.031 --> 02:35:07.900
Iraqi,
except for,
you know,
maybe a few excursions into Kurdistan,
you know,

2721
02:35:08.220 --> 02:35:09.770
kind of kept her rocking chair.

2722
02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:11.731
<v 0>Big trouble.</v>

2723
02:35:11.731 --> 02:35:14.280
What about the people that lived there and had to deal with is evil fucking

2724
02:35:14.281 --> 02:35:15.220
serial killer son.

2725
02:35:15.460 --> 02:35:18.460
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
I mean you got death squads,
uh,
you know,</v>

2726
02:35:18.500 --> 02:35:21.290
going door to door again now knocking on doors and there's the Sunni

2727
02:35:21.291 --> 02:35:23.900
neighborhoods dragging people off the street and executing them right now.

2728
02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:25.093
I mean,

2729
02:35:25.730 --> 02:35:30.110
unless you give these separate sex of uh,
uh,

2730
02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:32.780
Islam,
their own countries,
unless I can be formed,

2731
02:35:32.781 --> 02:35:33.710
you're never gonna solve the problem.

2732
02:35:34.210 --> 02:35:36.070
<v 0>Yeah.
You will get rid of religion.</v>

2733
02:35:36.071 --> 02:35:39.570
Mushrooms get these motherfuckers the same shit they were eating when they went.

2734
02:35:39.580 --> 02:35:41.980
The sacred mushroom in the cross.
Just the head drop.

2735
02:35:41.981 --> 02:35:46.240
Mtma gray it on him.
You know what we need for real?

2736
02:35:46.450 --> 02:35:48.850
The problem that we have such a fast food culture,

2737
02:35:48.851 --> 02:35:51.280
microwave instant download society.

2738
02:35:51.490 --> 02:35:54.010
We need like a psychedelic Taser.

2739
02:35:55.840 --> 02:35:58.410
We just instantaneously get enlightened.

2740
02:35:58.900 --> 02:36:02.080
We don't have time for you to take a mushroom and be reasonable for an hour and

2741
02:36:02.081 --> 02:36:05.170
20 minutes and then get the facts and then sort of containing,

2742
02:36:05.530 --> 02:36:09.670
we need to just Taser people.
Ah,
I was being a dick.

2743
02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:14.820
Just Zap 'em I've tried Mac and yet the minute I get out of the psychedelic

2744
02:36:15.071 --> 02:36:19.300
Taser,
you can,
I already set it online.
It's this live man.

2745
02:36:19.301 --> 02:36:23.320
Just like the new Laguna beach.
The Shit.
Why?
No,
why,
what are you talking about?

2746
02:36:23.321 --> 02:36:25.630
I don't know.
When we were talking about psychedelic tasers,

2747
02:36:25.631 --> 02:36:29.170
we need to go over there and just tase the shit out of everybody with some sort

2748
02:36:29.171 --> 02:36:34.171
of a DMT tasered I just a quick introduction to God.

2749
02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:37.530
Like you listen you guys Agent Orange airplanes.
I'm ma'am.

2750
02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:43.350
You just fill the skies was enlightenment.
I did.
Didn't look right.
It

2751
02:36:43.470 --> 02:36:47.180
<v 3>rich just finished writing a great book that Breville would have a love and how</v>

2752
02:36:47.181 --> 02:36:49.400
Laguna beach was the,
not that I live there.

2753
02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:53.150
The how is the center point for all the Best Ah,

2754
02:36:53.420 --> 02:36:57.620
Afghan a hash into America.
Yeah.
And uh,

2755
02:36:57.621 --> 02:36:58.850
they had this big concert,

2756
02:36:58.851 --> 02:37:01.730
I think it was in 67 out in the canyon of Laguna Beach.

2757
02:37:01.731 --> 02:37:04.300
I don't know where that is,
but that dropped this uh,
uh,

2758
02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:07.550
this cargo plane flew over this crowd.
20,000 people,
you know,

2759
02:37:07.551 --> 02:37:11.030
it's like a grateful dead concert and dropped acid all over the crowd and it

2760
02:37:11.031 --> 02:37:15.020
became like a five day concert.
I never knew this history,
the city or that lyric.

2761
02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:16.570
Well you know what that was

2762
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:20.390
<v 0>back in when people were experiencing this new psychedelic freedom.</v>

2763
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:22.520
The word Hash is such a strange word to,

2764
02:37:22.521 --> 02:37:27.521
because Hash in a lot of places gets considered as being much more illegal than

2765
02:37:27.531 --> 02:37:30.940
marijuana.
Much more means in a lot of countries.
In fact,
it can,

2766
02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:34.640
you can get put to death for ash,
but all it is is THC.
All,

2767
02:37:34.641 --> 02:37:39.020
all it is is sort of,
but not in the effects.

2768
02:37:39.021 --> 02:37:43.220
Have you ever smoke hash?
It's just a,
it's just a pure version of THC.

2769
02:37:43.221 --> 02:37:47.630
It's just a more potent,
but it's very similar in the ways to smoking marijuana.

2770
02:37:47.631 --> 02:37:50.870
It's just more,
more powerful.
That's all it is.
It doesn't do it.

2771
02:37:50.871 --> 02:37:55.430
It's not like heroin.
It's not like it's,
you know,
crystal meth or anything crazy.

2772
02:37:55.431 --> 02:37:56.570
It's just just hash.

2773
02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:00.980
<v 3>I got an 18 year old son and uh,
you know,
I say he,
him growing up in Indonesia,</v>

2774
02:38:00.981 --> 02:38:03.560
we're hedged,
which has the lowest tolerance of drug use,

2775
02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:06.740
probably anywhere in the world.
He's got a friend actually,
he went to jail for,

2776
02:38:06.741 --> 02:38:09.500
you know,
six months or just,
just,
you know,
when he was 16 at the time.

2777
02:38:09.650 --> 02:38:12.020
But just having one joint,
you're going to have one joint.

2778
02:38:12.021 --> 02:38:14.980
You can be Gel for 10 years if you're an adult.
And,
um,

2779
02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:16.880
and so all these friends in Indonesia,

2780
02:38:16.881 --> 02:38:19.300
he went out and go his medical marijuana card,
you know,
one of us,

2781
02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:21.630
the green doctor and Venice Beach,
right?
He's God.

2782
02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:25.950
And he puts it on Facebook and he says,
I get home delivery with my own way.

2783
02:38:26.570 --> 02:38:31.160
God bless America.
So he sees optimism here.
What were you doing in Indonesia?

2784
02:38:31.250 --> 02:38:35.570
Well,
I,
you know,
I only meant to live there for a year.

2785
02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:38.960
Um,
and then when you turn into 10 years,
I had a business in Australia,

2786
02:38:38.961 --> 02:38:43.340
which are sold,
uh,
at one together.
Indonesia,
uh,
you know,

2787
02:38:43.370 --> 02:38:45.920
had a bar there at one stage,
like a

2788
02:38:47.690 --> 02:38:52.160
brothel in Indonesia.
I didn't want to say bar.
Wow.

2789
02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:56.000
So,
uh,
so yeah.
And then I started writing full time when I was in Indonesia,

2790
02:38:56.060 --> 02:38:58.820
Indonesia.
So you're a real international traveler,

2791
02:38:58.821 --> 02:39:01.450
you've seen it from all around.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Kind of.
Well,

2792
02:39:01.490 --> 02:39:04.390
what propelled me into writing about religion was a,
I,
you know,

2793
02:39:04.391 --> 02:39:07.370
I sort of witnessed the o five a terrorist attack in Bali,

2794
02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:10.640
twin suicide bombs and Jim Brown beach will right there that night.

2795
02:39:10.641 --> 02:39:13.250
And that made me from a journalistic point of view,

2796
02:39:13.251 --> 02:39:16.040
really wanted to delve into what's in his religious texts,

2797
02:39:16.041 --> 02:39:20.090
which would make somebody a straps c four to themselves and blood themselves.

2798
02:39:20.091 --> 02:39:21.500
Let's move or rain in front of a crowded,

2799
02:39:21.710 --> 02:39:25.820
we'll weave in a crowded restaurant taking women and children with them.
So,
uh,

2800
02:39:27.230 --> 02:39:29.900
he just fucking put a somber note to the end of this podcast.

2801
02:39:29.950 --> 02:39:34.070
We want to talk about weight again.
No,
no.
I mean,
it's really is,
yeah.

2802
02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:36.720
<v 0>All about the mechanisms of the human mind,
right?</v>

2803
02:39:36.721 --> 02:39:41.721
That ideologies can allow people or give people the motivation to do some crazy

2804
02:39:42.631 --> 02:39:43.130
shit,

2805
02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:46.710
including things of their own selves and not just ideologies that are accepted,

2806
02:39:46.711 --> 02:39:51.090
establish ideologies like Islam or Christianity.
But like those,

2807
02:39:51.420 --> 02:39:55.680
those heaven's gate guys who cut their balls off and fucking wore purple Nike's

2808
02:39:55.681 --> 02:39:58.470
and waited for the spaceship behind the comment.
There's,

2809
02:39:58.471 --> 02:40:03.471
there's something about the human mind that is so easily influenced by an Alpha

2810
02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:09.240
or an idea or a message from a higher power,

2811
02:40:09.270 --> 02:40:13.950
whatever it is.
This something about the human mind.
It's so influenced.

2812
02:40:13.951 --> 02:40:17.370
That's a truly a dangerous but malleable thing.

2813
02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:20.640
<v 3>We want to believe in something higher than ourselves.
You know,
that's,
you know,</v>

2814
02:40:20.641 --> 02:40:23.190
that's human proclivity.
We want that.
But why is that?

2815
02:40:23.191 --> 02:40:26.360
Is there something higher than ourselves and we just haven't accessed yet?
Oh,

2816
02:40:26.370 --> 02:40:28.680
I think,
you know,
our highest sense of consciousness and you know,

2817
02:40:28.681 --> 02:40:29.880
as you said before,
we,
you know,

2818
02:40:29.881 --> 02:40:34.470
our ego can't let go of the fact that once we're dead,
we're dead.

2819
02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:35.760
I don't think are ready to go come.

2820
02:40:35.761 --> 02:40:39.630
Except the fact that we are really nothing more than a virus or a bacteria that

2821
02:40:39.631 --> 02:40:44.610
occupies the planet and a Iowa,
you know,
my,
you know,
people who do believe,

2822
02:40:44.611 --> 02:40:47.590
you know,
I never tried.
I'm not a an evangelical life.
Yes.

2823
02:40:47.591 --> 02:40:51.720
By any means and as a lot of a lot of those guys,
but I'm not.

2824
02:40:51.721 --> 02:40:55.440
But I always like if I'm going to give some sort of literature of than my own

2825
02:40:55.441 --> 02:41:00.120
books to,
uh,
to someone who's our religious,
it's Kyle Sagans Pale blue.

2826
02:41:00.121 --> 02:41:04.950
Dot.
I mean,
that really puts into perspective,
you know,
uh,
you know,

2827
02:41:04.951 --> 02:41:07.890
the mailing lists of,
uh,
of the human existence.

2828
02:41:08.030 --> 02:41:11.930
<v 0>Yeah.
Have you ever been to the Keck observatory in the Big Island?
No,
I haven't.</v>

2829
02:41:12.170 --> 02:41:13.190
I just got back.

2830
02:41:13.310 --> 02:41:16.330
I've been there once before the time I went before it was way better because I,

2831
02:41:16.370 --> 02:41:19.640
this time I went during the super moon and the moon was so big he couldn't see

2832
02:41:19.641 --> 02:41:22.220
Jack Shit.
Like you just saw the moon.
You didn't see any stars.

2833
02:41:22.221 --> 02:41:24.350
But the last time I went it was the moon was dark.

2834
02:41:24.770 --> 02:41:28.460
And you see the entire cosmos.

2835
02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:33.520
It's so fascinating because the Keck observatory is established in an area of

2836
02:41:34.101 --> 02:41:39.101
Hawaii that's above the clouds and the big island has certain diffused street

2837
02:41:40.091 --> 02:41:44.510
lights.
So it doesn't,
uh,
put up light pollution.
So when you're up there,

2838
02:41:44.511 --> 02:41:49.511
you get the full vision of the night sky and it's unbelievably,

2839
02:41:50.750 --> 02:41:54.980
unbelievably spectacular.
And also like,
uh,
it's very,

2840
02:41:55.160 --> 02:41:59.330
that word life changing gets used a lot for experiences that people have.

2841
02:41:59.331 --> 02:42:03.050
But my experience,
the first time I went,
which is I guess about nine years ago,

2842
02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:06.530
my first time going up there was truly life changing.

2843
02:42:06.530 --> 02:42:10.880
Like I looked up there and I saw the stars and I realize like,
we're on a planet,

2844
02:42:11.460 --> 02:42:13.520
a planet,
we're flying around in space.

2845
02:42:13.521 --> 02:42:17.270
We're just so preoccupied with her own bullshit that we forget that we're on

2846
02:42:17.271 --> 02:42:19.400
this planet and how small we,
uh,
yeah.
If we,

2847
02:42:19.401 --> 02:42:22.040
I think if we could see the stars a daily basis,

2848
02:42:22.041 --> 02:42:25.190
I think we would be a different attitude.
Slowly but surely,

2849
02:42:25.191 --> 02:42:27.080
I think people would establish a different attitude.

2850
02:42:27.260 --> 02:42:31.100
It's just this sheer humility that comes with looking at the stars.

2851
02:42:31.150 --> 02:42:33.440
Just gazing up at that thing,
you know?

2852
02:42:33.441 --> 02:42:36.320
And just if you want to look for a greater power,

2853
02:42:36.321 --> 02:42:38.900
or do you want to look for a greater thing than us?
Just the,

2854
02:42:38.930 --> 02:42:43.100
just the vastness of the infinity that you're looking at is,
is enough.

2855
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:46.070
Because when it's just black,
it's cheesy to ignore.
You look up,

2856
02:42:46.071 --> 02:42:48.530
you see a couple of dots.
Yeah.
Well,
the moon's out tonight.
This isn't,
you know,

2857
02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:52.160
you get back to your house and you watch fucking cardiac Sheehan's and fall

2858
02:42:52.161 --> 02:42:55.940
asleep with your socks on like a fucking idiot.
You know?
I mean,

2859
02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.850
it's too easy to do that.
It's too easy to fall into these traps.

2860
02:42:59.330 --> 02:43:04.280
I think people that are looking for something larger than,
than life itself,

2861
02:43:04.310 --> 02:43:08.480
it's right above us.
We're in it.
It's not even above us.
It's around us.

2862
02:43:08.570 --> 02:43:09.403
We're floating in it

2863
02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:12.130
<v 3>and it's humbling.
And you know,
that makes your,
uh,</v>

2864
02:43:12.370 --> 02:43:16.120
<v 2>your earthly worries seem insignificant and puts things in perspective.
I think.</v>

2865
02:43:16.350 --> 02:43:19.780
Well,
that was the Reagan speech.
Remember that Reagan's speech we talked about,

2866
02:43:19.781 --> 02:43:20.110
uh,

2867
02:43:20.110 --> 02:43:24.250
how quickly we'd put our differences aside if we were being faced with a threat

2868
02:43:24.251 --> 02:43:27.730
from another planet.
Yeah,
that's right.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Boy,

2869
02:43:27.731 --> 02:43:31.150
the fucking Ufo nuts.
Love that.
Does Ufo nutters,

2870
02:43:31.180 --> 02:43:35.380
they claim to that one speech by this crazy old man who was probably suffering

2871
02:43:35.381 --> 02:43:39.760
from dementia and we didn't know well was he though in the end he was in the

2872
02:43:39.830 --> 02:43:44.580
Endi was,
but when you remember when those,
um,
Iran contra trials were going on?

2873
02:43:45.030 --> 02:43:49.750
They asked him,
yeah.
Like did you really sell arms to,
to Iran?
And he was like,
ah,

2874
02:43:49.751 --> 02:43:53.590
I don't remember.
I don't recall.
I remember that.
That was what he said.

2875
02:43:53.591 --> 02:43:54.880
I do not recall.

2876
02:43:55.270 --> 02:43:58.630
And they allowed him to get away with it cause he was an old man as the
strategy.

2877
02:43:59.070 --> 02:44:04.050
If he's son,
uh,
Ronald Reagan,
uh,
same link,
same night,

2878
02:44:04.420 --> 02:44:08.470
uh,
and his book about his dad,
he said,
yeah,
in the last two years,
uh,

2879
02:44:08.650 --> 02:44:12.970
he was in full mode,
dementia,
you know,
and uh,
probably the CIA,

2880
02:44:13.540 --> 02:44:17.710
CIA dosed him up with some crazy shit.
Keep them stupid.
I tell you,

2881
02:44:17.711 --> 02:44:22.390
just start a new conspiracy website somewhere.
Probably his son's gay too,
right?

2882
02:44:22.391 --> 02:44:25.240
It's like a ballet dancer.
And I think so,
I'm not sure what to show.

2883
02:44:25.270 --> 02:44:29.230
It's like a liberal talk show hosts and stuff like completely rebelled.
Yeah.

2884
02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:31.510
Although there's two sons.
There's one,
there's one,

2885
02:44:31.550 --> 02:44:34.540
here's the liberal wine is on torture and the other one is not.

2886
02:44:34.541 --> 02:44:38.600
He's a right wing lane.
Oh,
the other one that didn't the right wing loon.
No.

2887
02:44:38.601 --> 02:44:42.700
Didn't know his dad very well,
right?
That's correct.
Yeah.
What a mess.

2888
02:44:43.210 --> 02:44:45.880
Trying to fucking recapture the old glory.

2889
02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:51.400
It's so weird when I see people fall in love with the idea of what rhet Ronald

2890
02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:55.660
Reagan was the reminisce about the Reagan administration and with a great

2891
02:44:55.661 --> 02:44:58.450
president.
Reagan was,
and I've had these conversations with people.
I'm like,

2892
02:44:58.451 --> 02:45:00.820
what the fuck are you even talking about man?

2893
02:45:01.390 --> 02:45:06.160
You like doing a Disney movie of Ronald Reagan?
The mythology is incredible.

2894
02:45:06.161 --> 02:45:08.260
I mean,
he didn't low a Texas on the middle class,

2895
02:45:08.261 --> 02:45:09.490
so to Paul or anything like that,

2896
02:45:09.700 --> 02:45:14.100
he only writes taxes on the wealthy and sand the budget,
you know,

2897
02:45:14.110 --> 02:45:18.250
blew out the budget the next year and put the economy into a recession and then

2898
02:45:18.251 --> 02:45:22.180
had the raise taxes,
something like four or five times after that.

2899
02:45:22.181 --> 02:45:26.140
So the whole myth of him being a tax cutter and a job creator and so forth.

2900
02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:30.100
You know,
it's all steeped in mythology,
you know,
the,
and the big one,
of course,

2901
02:45:30.101 --> 02:45:32.260
his introduction of the political,

2902
02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:36.070
the to the political world of the religious right.
That was the big one.

2903
02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:40.720
That was a,
well,
if,
if it wasn't for them,
the Jerry Falwell's moral majority,

2904
02:45:40.721 --> 02:45:42.270
he would never have been president.
You know,

2905
02:45:42.450 --> 02:45:46.080
the Christian rights waived him into power.
Jerry motherfucking fall.
Well,

2906
02:45:46.410 --> 02:45:47.620
not crazy.
Yeah,

2907
02:45:47.650 --> 02:45:52.150
but wasn't it like Al Capone that made w who was it that uh,
no,

2908
02:45:52.170 --> 02:45:53.050
it wasn't al Capone,

2909
02:45:53.051 --> 02:45:58.030
but who was it that made a JFK president was also the Chicago mob.

2910
02:45:58.060 --> 02:46:02.150
Oh,
it was the Frank Sinatra Arfa.
Whoever the fuck it was.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2911
02:46:02.151 --> 02:46:06.340
I mean probably freak some ballots.
Southwest Chicago,

2912
02:46:08.740 --> 02:46:12.050
we only people when they're dead.
We really do.
We don't,
we,

2913
02:46:12.410 --> 02:46:17.390
we celebrate them when they're no longer with us.
That's it.
America.
It's America.

2914
02:46:17.391 --> 02:46:20.780
Fuck yeah.
When Jimmy Carter died,
she's going to be a Goddamn sane right now.

2915
02:46:20.781 --> 02:46:24.740
He gets maligned and misunderstood.
He's probably,
in my opinion,

2916
02:46:24.741 --> 02:46:29.090
the most philosophical and the most interesting former president ever.
Well,

2917
02:46:29.091 --> 02:46:30.430
here's something interesting.
When,
uh,

2918
02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:33.320
six months after Jerry Falwell was out of power,

2919
02:46:33.690 --> 02:46:38.270
his approval rating was 64% roughly.
You mean Ronald Reagan?

2920
02:46:38.660 --> 02:46:42.980
Jerry Falwell power.
Jimmy Carter.
Did I say to her?

2921
02:46:45.100 --> 02:46:47.750
What did you put it in my coffee?
Sorry.
Master too good.

2922
02:46:47.780 --> 02:46:51.770
How to dose yet to get the most out of Ya.
Yeah.
Know when Jimmy.
Yeah,

2923
02:46:51.771 --> 02:46:54.710
Jimmy Carter was a approval writing six months out of office with something like

2924
02:46:54.711 --> 02:46:57.800
64% uh,
Ronald Reagan's approval rating,

2925
02:46:57.801 --> 02:47:00.950
six months out of office was something like 42%.

2926
02:47:01.250 --> 02:47:05.570
Now Paul's on everything,
but they take a snapshot in time of,
you know,

2927
02:47:05.571 --> 02:47:09.470
the political winds.
Reagan wasn't a popular president when he left office.

2928
02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:13.320
It was only much later,
much later,
decades later,
decades later.
And that's two,

2929
02:47:13.321 --> 02:47:17.550
two administrations.
And look at,
look what's happening to push now.
Re Re,
re,

2930
02:47:17.610 --> 02:47:22.400
you know,
revisionism is I glossing over or trying to tarnish the toad.

2931
02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:26.150
There was bushes,
legacy.
Now you know,
the original Bush,

2932
02:47:26.151 --> 02:47:29.120
which is completely been glossed over.
Herbert Walker Bush.

2933
02:47:29.121 --> 02:47:31.910
And never hear a negative thought about that guy.
Nah,
he's a saint now.

2934
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:37.280
Fucking guy was the head of the CIA.
Jesus Christ.
We're weird.

2935
02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:40.580
We're weird when we do that.
Yeah.

2936
02:47:40.980 --> 02:47:42.980
Well I haven't had conversations with people at Carter,

2937
02:47:42.981 --> 02:47:45.670
the weakest president ever and this and I'm like,
oh,
it's fucking,
it's stopped.

2938
02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:49.850
Ever listened to the guy talk.
He's very philosophical introspective guy.

2939
02:47:50.180 --> 02:47:52.460
Probably one of the most open,
honest,

2940
02:47:52.461 --> 02:47:54.620
introspective guys we've ever had as a president.

2941
02:47:54.621 --> 02:47:57.990
But Americans day where Americans are hostile to intellectuals.
I lucked up.

2942
02:47:58.030 --> 02:48:00.780
I like Americans to act on raw emotion and uh,
you know,

2943
02:48:01.070 --> 02:48:05.070
anger and fury can't we have both?
Can we have both?
Yeah.
No,

2944
02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:07.820
I think about foreign policy wise,

2945
02:48:07.970 --> 02:48:11.000
Obama has tried to be circumspect here and uh,

2946
02:48:11.020 --> 02:48:13.800
and to Fink with clarity before he acts.
Yeah.

2947
02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:16.940
But this whole NSA thing will be his legacy.

2948
02:48:16.970 --> 02:48:21.750
The Edward Snowden thing will be his legacy.
The,
you know,
the,

2949
02:48:21.860 --> 02:48:22.270
the,

2950
02:48:22.270 --> 02:48:26.540
when you look at the hope and change website that they had in place before when

2951
02:48:26.541 --> 02:48:31.541
Obama was running for president and his established position of assisting

2952
02:48:31.791 --> 02:48:36.650
whistle blowers who are exposing crimes.
And then you look at what he's become,

2953
02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:41.060
you know,
look at what his legacy is.
It's,
it's,
that's,
that's,
that's really the,

2954
02:48:41.061 --> 02:48:43.160
exactly.
I know,
I often say when a,
you know,

2955
02:48:43.161 --> 02:48:45.350
when people ask in interviews and so forth,

2956
02:48:45.590 --> 02:48:49.000
how do you think of Bama will be remembered as a president and Ios side.

2957
02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:52.190
He'll just be remembered as slightly better than the alternative.

2958
02:48:53.060 --> 02:48:55.400
That's how his presidency be remembered.
And with that,

2959
02:48:55.670 --> 02:48:58.330
we're at a time that was an awesome three hours man.

2960
02:48:58.520 --> 02:49:01.890
What's that three hour flew by.
Wow.
That's incredible.

2961
02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.020
That's how it works over here.
Right.
And we do,

2962
02:49:04.100 --> 02:49:07.800
we're to get right into peak hour traffic.
We dose you up and we send you a,

2963

I don't think we figured anything out.</v>

2964
02:49:11.970 --> 02:49:15.690
I don't think.
But it was a lot of fun.
