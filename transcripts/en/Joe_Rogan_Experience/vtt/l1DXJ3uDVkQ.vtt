<v Speaker 2>in and also seeing all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>stages.</v>

96
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.523
<v Speaker 2>Like when you take a young guy on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road with you or when you see a young </v>

97
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do a really good set of the store.</v>

98
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.263
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you recognize like those moments were </v>

99
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 2>when you were young and you were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to figure your material out and</v>

100
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:01.504
<v Speaker 2>you were just starting to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>like how to really get to the heart of </v>

101
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 2>the matter quicker or what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's actually funny about this,</v>

102
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 2>like what's clouding my judgment where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't figure out how to get this funny,</v>

103
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:12.154
<v Speaker 2>but occasionally these spark shine </v>
<v Speaker 2>through and you have a killer bit and </v>

104
00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:15.924
<v Speaker 2>like in everybody knows like a young guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>who in the early months we'll have like </v>

105
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 2>one bit when you see that bed and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker's funny.</v>

106
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Like he's saying some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he might not have it right now with</v>

107
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:29.470
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you see someone who's got that,</v>

108
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 2>it makes you like really aware of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole process,</v>

109
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole process of just getting your </v>

110
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:41.180
<v Speaker 2>legs under you as a comic and doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

111
00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:42.014
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you're around people who are </v>

112
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 2>also doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it feeds off of it,</v>

113
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.470
<v Speaker 2>like you could stay hungry like deepened</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your,</v>

114
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.323
<v Speaker 2>your career just by continuing to create</v>
<v Speaker 2>material and continuing to be around </v>

<v Speaker 2>other guys who are hungry.</v>

116
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.423
<v Speaker 2>And when you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the things that's going on </v>

<v Speaker 1>He became like the d don't give a fuck </v>

141
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:04.334
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He became like the new metric of not </v>

142
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:09.220
<v Speaker 1>giving a fuck like they used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted.</v>

143
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.150

147
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>That would be like the last straw of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that he has left in his body.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It wasn't about the material.</v>

156
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.990
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't about anything but the look in</v>

<v Speaker 1>but one we call your kids to do.</v>

191

<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MrT.</v>

192
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 1>was one of the most terrifying fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>villains ever in a boxing movie,</v>

193
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.350
<v Speaker 1>not Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the doorman challenge?</v>

<v Speaker 1>That dorm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he became famous?</v>

195
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

196
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.093
<v Speaker 1>Him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

197
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.963
<v Speaker 1>t him and a bunch of other dudes on NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a show about either doorman </v>

198
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 1>what bounces and they did something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how he was noticed.</v>

199
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:53.683
<v Speaker 1>Something weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a show about the toughest </v>

200
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.030
<v Speaker 1>bounces for awhile,</v>

201
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 2>six episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was the main one.</v>

202
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.543
<v Speaker 2>Bounces doorman in 1980.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like wild world of sports type </v>

203
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:05.671
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

204
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 2>go back to that for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie to that clubber Lang footage.</v>

205
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:10.944
<v Speaker 2>The training footage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was under the impression that like I </v>

206
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 2>remember thinking that he really looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>good as a boxer,</v>

207
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 2>but I'm watching him shadow box there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

208
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:24.340
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one has a gift.</v>

209
00:09:24.341 --> 00:09:25.174
<v Speaker 2>The throwing like smoke at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody looks good while you're </v>

210
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 2>watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that scene.</v>

211
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 2>When Mickey was looking at the bubbles </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's getting mad,</v>

212
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.870
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ugh,</v>

213
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 2>ugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you like let it go,</v>

214
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 2>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll a show him shadow boxing,</v>

215
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.683
<v Speaker 2>which sometimes people don't look that </v>
<v Speaker 2>good when they're shadowboxing because </v>

216
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 2>they're just trying to loosen their body</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

217
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.143
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of different like right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there that does not look that guy who </v>

218
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:53.880
<v Speaker 2>actually knows how to punch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

219
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.000
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a lot of swinging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

220
00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:57.390
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

221
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Those aren't punches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like a lot of arm movements.</v>

222
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.740
<v Speaker 2>We've got to meet in the head cut at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time,</v>

223
00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Speaker 2>it's 1980.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know what to expect.</v>

224
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a thing with was shadowboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some people think that shadowboxing</v>

225
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.753
<v Speaker 2>should just be a loosening up thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just do it loose and they let the </v>

226
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.373
<v Speaker 2>shoulders go loose and they try to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>on their snap and they tried to move </v>

227
00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:17.394
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's some people that think </v>

228
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:21.360
<v Speaker 2>you should treat it almost as if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

229
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 2>like as if you're simulating a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Jamie looked this up,</v>

230
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Vault Illini shadowboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a glory kickboxing champ and he put</v>

231
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:36.060
<v Speaker 2>up this video of how he shadow boxes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shadow boxes.</v>

232
00:10:36.061 --> 00:10:36.894
<v Speaker 2>Like he's in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't think of it as time off or a </v>

233
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:44.070
<v Speaker 2>warm up or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he does is he fights like a pretend</v>

234
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.933
<v Speaker 2>opponent.</v>

235
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty interesting because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys don't do it that way.</v>

236
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Like not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to this extent like uh,</v>

237
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.590
<v Speaker 2>you know guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're shadow boxing,</v>

238
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:55.110
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kinda loosened around you doing it on</v>

239
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:57.000
<v Speaker 2>your own pace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're working on your own shit,</v>

240
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.013
<v Speaker 2>but what he does is kind of more like he</v>
<v Speaker 2>treats it like a different kind of a </v>

241
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.350
<v Speaker 2>workout like Justin Fortune does down at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gym to.</v>

242
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Does he the second look at it as like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>calorie burner in the beginning?</v>

243
00:11:06.841 --> 00:11:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Really just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you do it correctly,</v>

244
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:11.670
<v Speaker 2>he says you should break a big sweater </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

245
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do it correctly.</v>

246
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:14.304
<v Speaker 2>Which I don't know just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's a lot of people think it's </v>

247
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.820
<v Speaker 2>like visualization they think might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>as important as anything else.</v>

248
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Like everything's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

249
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:23.790
<v Speaker 2>it's important to be in shape.</v>

250
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.623
<v Speaker 2>It's important to be strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important to have experience in </v>

251
00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:27.900
<v Speaker 2>support and to have really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique,</v>

252
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's also important to visualize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about carving pathways</v>

253
00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:34.284
<v Speaker 2>in the brain and obviously if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientist and you'll listen to </v>

254
00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:37.021
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

255
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:37.854
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idiot doesn't know what the fuck </v>

256
00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:40.550
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

257
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.590
<v Speaker 2>there's something about carving </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathways.</v>

258
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.240
<v Speaker 2>This is not it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

259
00:11:45.241 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 2>there's a different visual comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a dream shadowboxing.</v>

260
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:52.910
<v Speaker 2>He's throwing kicks and punches and </v>
<v Speaker 2>knees and backing up and you have a.</v>

261
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 2>This would stand up like you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself onstage killing.</v>

262
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.890
<v Speaker 2>I've tried and I can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like positive realization.</v>

263
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it works with standup.</v>

264
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.880
<v Speaker 2>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

265
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with stand up the thing,</v>

266
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.170
<v Speaker 2>the kids doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

267
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.670
<v Speaker 2>I tried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took the reef of fucked me up,</v>

268
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:13.900
<v Speaker 2>but I couldn't come to focus.</v>

269
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Like the visualizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

270
00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Like I couldn't see myself onstage like </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking out and seeing people go.</v>

271
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I could see myself coming out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>garden.</v>

272
00:12:20.861 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's just for me personally,</v>

273
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:25.384
<v Speaker 2>here's why I would try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would try not to think like that </v>

274
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.383
<v Speaker 2>because if I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I visualize myself doing something and </v>

275
00:12:31.511 --> 00:12:33.940
<v Speaker 2>doing it really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

276
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:35.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think of,</v>

277
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:36.184
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't think of the thing I was </v>

278
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:38.824
<v Speaker 2>doing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm thinking of like the accolades </v>

279
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 2>or the position it is or look you're on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a big stage and look,</v>

280
00:12:46.271 --> 00:12:47.104
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at this place and you're at </v>

281
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Massey Hall in Toronto or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

282
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Speaker 2>some historic venue like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then one day I was there like,</v>

283
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.550
<v Speaker 2>that seems like you're thinking more </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

284
00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:03.140
<v Speaker 2>about success than what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what success really is,</v>

285
00:13:03.141 --> 00:13:05.470
<v Speaker 2>is like if you're doing something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to do it,</v>

286
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.150
<v Speaker 2>do it the best you can.</v>

287
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Not the or the reaction that it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if I'm concentrating on the reaction,</v>

288
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.410
<v Speaker 2>like I'm concentrating on going up there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and killing,</v>

289
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.220
<v Speaker 2>I would have to be visualizing doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

290
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 2>so I'd have to begin realizing people </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing.</v>

291
00:13:20.861 --> 00:13:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried,</v>

292
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:23.104
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've sat there like at the gym and put </v>

293
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.073
<v Speaker 2>right to cool off and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe I'll see myself killing for </v>

294
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:30.910
<v Speaker 2>the special or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see any of that shit.</v>

295
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't that make sense though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That if you think of yourself as killing</v>

296
00:13:34.601 --> 00:13:35.434
<v Speaker 2>you thinking of other people laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not thinking about yourself </v>

297
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:40.500
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

298
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Like so if you're visualizing skiing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about skiing,</v>

299
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're thinking about tucking.</v>

300
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:48.940
<v Speaker 2>You're thinking about doing your moves </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the correct way.</v>

301
00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:51.000
<v Speaker 2>You get the most amount of speed and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most amount of controls.</v>

302
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.330
<v Speaker 2>You're headed down this hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

303
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.800
<v Speaker 2>You're not thinking about other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not thinking about other people's</v>

304
00:13:56.801 --> 00:13:59.440
<v Speaker 2>response to each one of those things you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

305
00:13:59.441 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Like if every time he did a curve and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't get a laugh,</v>

306
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:03.641
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

307
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was skiing good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

308
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.570
<v Speaker 2>if you tell a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you get a laugh,</v>

309
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.463
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you don't want to think about that </v>

310
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:11.230
<v Speaker 2>laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to visualize a laugh.</v>

311
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.390
<v Speaker 2>You want to pretend that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing at it.</v>

312
00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:16.480
<v Speaker 2>You want to actually find out what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny and have other people tell you for</v>

313
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.220
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you kind of know,</v>

314
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Speaker 2>but you don't really know until you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in front of them.</v>

315
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.233
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to visualize that is really weird </v>

316
00:14:24.491 --> 00:14:25.324
<v Speaker 2>because you're visualizing two different</v>
<v Speaker 2>mindsets so you're not in this the zone </v>

317
00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:29.940
<v Speaker 2>of actually being there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

318
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.520
<v Speaker 2>you're visualizing artificial laughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

319
00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:37.810
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could visualize this state </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're feeling when you're killing,</v>

320
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.213
<v Speaker 2>when you're really relaxed on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're having a good time and </v>

321
00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:44.170
<v Speaker 2>everything's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could visualize that state.</v>

322
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.950
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

323
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:47.853
<v Speaker 2>but I think even that state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could only like visualize it and I </v>

324
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't say only.</v>

325
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.540
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I could only do it in chunks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I just think it's better to just</v>

326
00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on just doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just never worked for me.</v>

327
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:05.560
<v Speaker 3>So I wonder if you ever did up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I on it.</v>

328
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:06.403
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think would stand up like you </v>

329
00:15:08.661 --> 00:15:09.494
<v Speaker 3>could do a lot of sets and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if he should </v>

330
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:12.254
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on it as much as </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on just life itself and </v>

331
00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:21.710
<v Speaker 3>finding things that you think are funny </v>
<v Speaker 3>and interesting.</v>

332
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.003
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because sometimes if you concentrate </v>

333
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.180
<v Speaker 3>just on standup too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you almost like narrows your focus.</v>

334
00:15:28.181 --> 00:15:29.860
<v Speaker 3>So you're thinking so much about </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup.</v>

335
00:15:29.861 --> 00:15:30.694
<v Speaker 3>You're not thinking about shit to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about onstage because you're not really </v>

336
00:15:33.101 --> 00:15:34.480
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

337
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.353
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're obsessed with some tour date </v>

338
00:15:37.871 --> 00:15:40.180
<v Speaker 3>details or some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

339
00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.630
<v Speaker 3>some thing that might be an offer that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the table.</v>

340
00:15:43.631 --> 00:15:44.464
<v Speaker 3>What do you think I should do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of thinking about that kind of </v>

341
00:15:46.241 --> 00:15:47.074
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

342
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.383
<v Speaker 3>you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you only have a certain amount of </v>

343
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:52.573
<v Speaker 3>resources that your brain has available </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's when you can stop thinking </v>

344
00:15:57.711 --> 00:16:02.711
<v Speaker 3>about like if you can just push any </v>
<v Speaker 3>career ideas completely out of your head</v>

345
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:08.950
<v Speaker 3>and just exist as a person and then go </v>
<v Speaker 3>and do stuff.</v>

346
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.650
<v Speaker 3>If you could figure out how to shut that</v>
<v Speaker 3>off and go and do stuff,</v>

347
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:17.860

<v Speaker 3>My curiosity and an honest way.</v>

350
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Instead of thinking about religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading,</v>

351
00:16:26.841 --> 00:16:27.674
<v Speaker 3>things that I would think would be funny</v>
<v Speaker 3>on stage or read and stuff that I think </v>

352
00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:33.980
<v Speaker 3>would be fun to talk about in a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just look at Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>up in a little half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a bull to get the party started my</v>

358
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:51.590

<v Speaker 3>weed.</v>

360
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.313

<v Speaker 3>but it's going to go down for people </v>

361
00:16:55.671 --> 00:16:59.090
<v Speaker 3>like me because the edible count is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going down to 10 milligrams.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the little towns,</v>

460
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:26.283
<v Speaker 2>they get the videos and get a mat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do all that shit by themselves </v>

461
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:31.900
<v Speaker 2>watching a fucking videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've told me when I went to Omaha,</v>

462
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.710
<v Speaker 2>people came in from our ma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a 10th planet Endo Model.</v>

463
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:37.840
<v Speaker 2>That's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people who don't want to make.</v>

464
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.730
<v Speaker 2>The people were telling me they get like</v>
<v Speaker 2>couches,</v>

465
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu couches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mattress.</v>

466
00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:43.114
<v Speaker 2>That's like they're fucking grassy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if your little town doesn't have an </v>

467
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.343
<v Speaker 2>eddie spreading and now like his </v>
<v Speaker 2>students are winning fucking tournament </v>

468
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:52.114
<v Speaker 2>and now Ebi is on Tbi is game the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to ever happen to submission </v>

469
00:21:57.071 --> 00:21:57.904
<v Speaker 2>grappling because it made it exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a way to about rules </v>

470
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:03.010
<v Speaker 2>and you know that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I'm reading Hugh Jitsu magazine</v>

471
00:22:03.011 --> 00:22:03.844
<v Speaker 2>and this saying that they're gonna take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna start using Ebi rules and </v>

472
00:22:07.241 --> 00:22:09.890
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ebi Is Eddie Bravo exhibit.</v>

473
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

474
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Chael Sonnen did it and here's how </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful Eddie is.</v>

475
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Eddie doesn't even want money for them </v>
<v Speaker 2>using it.</v>

476
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

477
00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I just want those rules to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>established as the best rules.</v>

478
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Just give me credit called the Ebi rules</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can use some smart way to do it.</v>

479
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:31.870
<v Speaker 2>He just wants to spread Jujitsu in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right way and you know,</v>

480
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.733
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with having a non tbi rules of any </v>

481
00:22:34.941 --> 00:22:35.800
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

482
00:22:35.801 --> 00:22:38.770
<v Speaker 2>like if somebody wants to do like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>metamorris was doing and have these long</v>

483
00:22:38.771 --> 00:22:41.650
<v Speaker 2>bouts and if they go to draw at the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to draw at the end,</v>

484
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot on the podcast,</v>

485
00:22:43.231 --> 00:22:44.064
<v Speaker 2>some of the time you got to break </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything down and be like just I bbs </v>

486
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:47.723
<v Speaker 2>and well there's anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So essentially anybody can essentially </v>

487
00:22:50.951 --> 00:22:53.590
<v Speaker 2>start their own rules like Abu Dhabi </v>
<v Speaker 2>where uh,</v>

488
00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Eddie choked out heuler they had a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting rules where the first period</v>

489
00:22:58.721 --> 00:23:02.890
<v Speaker 2>of the fight there was no points and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then encouraged you to go for it.</v>

490
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.293
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you try to submit someone within the </v>

491
00:23:05.441 --> 00:23:06.610
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

492
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.970
<v Speaker 2>first half of the fight or take it real </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative,</v>

493
00:23:09.971 --> 00:23:14.080
<v Speaker 2>which was another approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you play super defense for the first</v>

494
00:23:14.081 --> 00:23:14.710
<v Speaker 2>half of the fight.</v>

495
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Then at the second half of the fight you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can score points.</v>

496
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.860
<v Speaker 2>So you score points for take downs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>score points for guard,</v>

497
00:23:20.861 --> 00:23:22.870
<v Speaker 2>passes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>near submissions,</v>

498
00:23:22.871 --> 00:23:24.780
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think their,</v>

499
00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:29.620
<v Speaker 2>their logic was that if they just have </v>
<v Speaker 2>no points in the beginning,</v>

500
00:23:29.621 --> 00:23:32.710
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if a dude mounts you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter if a guy takes your back,</v>

501
00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:33.544
<v Speaker 2>if you defend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to attack him and go </v>

502
00:23:34.691 --> 00:23:35.524
<v Speaker 2>after him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you'd worried if I don't get </v>

503
00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:39.730
<v Speaker 2>this guy might be so far behind it </v>
<v Speaker 2>points I'll never catch up.</v>

504
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Like if you just go for it and you fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and you wind up in a bad position,</v>

505
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.520
<v Speaker 2>then you defend that position and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get back to your feet and then maybe</v>

506
00:23:46.521 --> 00:23:47.354
<v Speaker 2>the guy takes you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a sequence of events that if </v>

507
00:23:48.681 --> 00:23:52.280
<v Speaker 2>you're counting takedowns and near </v>
<v Speaker 2>submissions and things like that can put</v>

508
00:23:52.281 --> 00:23:53.870
<v Speaker 2>you in his giant deficit.</v>

509
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.790
<v Speaker 2>And if the guys that good that he could </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that to you,</v>

510
00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:58.610
<v Speaker 2>maybe you underestimated them and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>never catch up to them,</v>

511
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.120
<v Speaker 2>but you could find out if you just go </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it,</v>

512
00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:04.100
<v Speaker 2>if you both go for it and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry about points.</v>

513
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:05.083
<v Speaker 2>So that was their idea I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think to promote more excitement so </v>

514
00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:08.594
<v Speaker 2>people just go for it in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the idea about the second half </v>

515
00:24:11.841 --> 00:24:15.590
<v Speaker 2>is that once you're establishing who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the better grappler,</v>

516
00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.680
<v Speaker 2>when two guys roll and they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill each other,</v>

517
00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:23.690
<v Speaker 2>you learn pretty quick who's better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then if no one's better,</v>

518
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 2>if it's just by a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

519
00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:26.444
<v Speaker 2>very slight edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you've gotten to the second half </v>

520
00:24:28.491 --> 00:24:29.324
<v Speaker 2>of the fight and you both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're both in a neutral position but </v>

521
00:24:32.061 --> 00:24:32.894
<v Speaker 2>you both attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both defended and no one's had any sort </v>

522
00:24:35.121 --> 00:24:35.954
<v Speaker 2>of an upper hand.</v>

523
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.033
<v Speaker 2>Those last few minutes is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really going to count because </v>

524
00:24:38.901 --> 00:24:39.734
<v Speaker 2>that's the few minutes where your </v>
<v Speaker 2>determination in training camp showed </v>

525
00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:44.540
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your ability to adjust,</v>

526
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:45.613
<v Speaker 2>your ability to overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all those things really do </v>

527
00:24:47.391 --> 00:24:48.224
<v Speaker 2>determine who's best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So having that towards the end of the </v>

528
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:51.830
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

529
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.560
<v Speaker 2>How long has Abu Dhabi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I go to the whole man,</v>

530
00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.280
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question because at 2:15</v>
<v Speaker 2>says the two times I'm a don't remember,</v>

531
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking it's two tens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that seems like a long time.</v>

532
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.460
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was less than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

533
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Abo dobby submission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grappling time limits.</v>

534
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Because what does Eddie doing with Ebi?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does the first.</v>

535
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.900
<v Speaker 2>How many minutes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

536
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.370
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like the first nine minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

537
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.370
<v Speaker 2>They just go at it and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>points.</v>

538
00:25:22.371 --> 00:25:23.204
<v Speaker 2>And if some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they make it into the final or they </v>

539
00:25:24.891 --> 00:25:29.891
<v Speaker 2>make it a pass at time limit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they go through these series of bad</v>

540
00:25:30.591 --> 00:25:31.424
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>

541
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Like one guy starts on the other guy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and he has over under and then go,</v>

542
00:25:35.241 --> 00:25:35.841
<v Speaker 2>ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

543
00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:36.674
<v Speaker 2>And you start from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one guy has got your back and you </v>

544
00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:39.374
<v Speaker 2>have to defend it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you can tap him then he has an </v>

545
00:25:43.551 --> 00:25:46.940
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to try the same position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you could tap you,</v>

546
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.070
<v Speaker 2>I think it goes to who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God who.</v>

547
00:25:49.071 --> 00:25:53.870
<v Speaker 2>First I think it like it's in the amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time it took to tap them,</v>

548
00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:59.060
<v Speaker 2>so that's where the competition would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>five minutes over time.</v>

549
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.960
<v Speaker 2>So qualifying rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six minutes,</v>

550
00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:05.690
<v Speaker 2>three minutes overtime if there's a draw</v>
<v Speaker 2>finals,</v>

551
00:26:05.691 --> 00:26:08.660
<v Speaker 2>eight minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four minutes over time if there's a draw</v>

552
00:26:08.661 --> 00:26:12.200
<v Speaker 2>with no advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what it probably is like four minutes</v>

553
00:26:12.201 --> 00:26:14.720
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start scoring the point.</v>

554
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:15.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is right there at the first </v>

555
00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:18.200
<v Speaker 2>four minutes are without positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>points,</v>

556
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.130
<v Speaker 2>but negative points start from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the fight until the end.</v>

557
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.130
<v Speaker 2>And I think negative points or like when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you draw guard,</v>

558
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.580
<v Speaker 2>when you pull guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was a negative point.</v>

559
00:26:28.581 --> 00:26:29.414
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it still is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's silly because some </v>

560
00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:33.830
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they pull you into their guard,</v>

561
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:34.783
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's guys like vinny malaise </v>

562
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.720
<v Speaker 2>lace or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

563
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.890
<v Speaker 2>a Shinya Aoki.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy is just nasty fucking guard.</v>

564
00:26:42.891 --> 00:26:44.880
<v Speaker 2>If in his guard you're in a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

565
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.630
<v Speaker 2>the church is sponsoring vinny magalogs </v>
<v Speaker 2>a magalog is a bad mother.</v>

566
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.830
<v Speaker 2>I love his Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fucking high level man.</v>

567
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

568
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Speaker 2>he spent a lot of time fighting in MMA </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because of the fighting in the mma,</v>

569
00:26:58.501 --> 00:27:01.290
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people slept on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu.</v>

570
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:05.100
<v Speaker 2>They forget what a fiend ami is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He Flying Armbar,</v>

571
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:05.993
<v Speaker 2>paid the Pano,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's like this multiple time Brazilian </v>

572
00:27:09.061 --> 00:27:09.894
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu world champion and vinny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vinny Magalhaes hit him with a flying </v>

573
00:27:12.391 --> 00:27:13.224
<v Speaker 2>arm bar.</v>

574
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.213
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is like pulling your deck out and </v>

575
00:27:16.471 --> 00:27:18.990
<v Speaker 2>slapping it across a world champions </v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

576
00:27:18.991 --> 00:27:21.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how powerful that move.</v>

577
00:27:21.741 --> 00:27:24.390
<v Speaker 2>But when you say flying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check this out,</v>

578
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.380
<v Speaker 2>see if you could find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's huge.</v>

579
00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:29.214
<v Speaker 2>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually 230 pounds and he hits him with </v>

580
00:27:31.471 --> 00:27:34.620
<v Speaker 2>a flying arm bar and it's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was perfect.</v>

581
00:27:34.621 --> 00:27:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no defending.</v>

582
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Now this guy that he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is uh,</v>

583
00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.730
<v Speaker 2>this is Chris Weidman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got Chris Weidman with it too.</v>

584
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you could watch this to.</v>

585
00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean Vinnie did hit Chris Weidman with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same shit.</v>

586
00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vinnie's super worldclass.</v>

587
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Now you gotta remember Chris Weidman a </v>
<v Speaker 2>two time NCAA all American wrestler like</v>

588
00:27:54.631 --> 00:27:56.400
<v Speaker 2>super fucking grappler.</v>

589
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.440
<v Speaker 2>And that's how good Vinnie Meg Alexis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

590
00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he won the UFC,</v>

591
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.260
<v Speaker 2>let's see if you could find it in here </v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is a long match.</v>

592
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he,</v>

593
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:09.354
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he won the UFC middleweight title </v>

594
00:28:12.151 --> 00:28:12.984
<v Speaker 2>from Anderson Silva was widely thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be like one of the toughest best </v>

595
00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:18.114
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>best grapplers it's ever fought in the </v>

596
00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:22.410
<v Speaker 2>middleweight division.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a big strength of his,</v>

597
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:26.910
<v Speaker 2>is that he was just so nasty on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and so fucking strong.</v>

598
00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

599
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.560
<v Speaker 2>You see when a dude can do that to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Weidman,</v>

600
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.230
<v Speaker 2>that's what a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vinny Magalhaes says,</v>

601
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.390
<v Speaker 2>you just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't happen.</v>

602
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Watch this again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

603
00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:40.284
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he just took that with just </v>

604
00:28:43.681 --> 00:28:46.650
<v Speaker 2>spectacular technique and he's a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

605
00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:48.960
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he will say he's at least,</v>

606
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.110
<v Speaker 2>you know what to 10 or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to 15,</v>

607
00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:53.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

608
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:55.470
<v Speaker 2>In the UFC he fought a light </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight.</v>

609
00:28:55.471 --> 00:28:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go find.</v>

610
00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you've lost a Ryan Bader and the</v>

611
00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:02.580
<v Speaker 2>finals member of the ultimate fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's striking.</v>

612
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got better at striking,</v>

613
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:09.090
<v Speaker 2>but that was what had held him back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His Jujitsu is off the fucking chain.</v>

614
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.970
<v Speaker 2>He did another stint in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

615
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.830
<v Speaker 2>Me Do a couple stents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

616
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.980
<v Speaker 2>but like you get caught in that guy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>guard,</v>

617
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:19.410
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a bad position.</v>

618
00:29:19.411 --> 00:29:20.244
<v Speaker 2>So I disagree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like saying that pulling guard is a one </v>

619
00:29:24.001 --> 00:29:26.670
<v Speaker 2>point disadvantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he pulls a gun out on me,</v>

620
00:29:26.671 --> 00:29:28.520
<v Speaker 2>really mega lez urine health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>urine,</v>

621
00:29:28.521 --> 00:29:31.620
<v Speaker 2>hell no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like get out of it.</v>

622
00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:34.110
<v Speaker 2>But you're in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in severe danger.</v>

623
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.273
<v Speaker 2>There's people where their guard is more</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a defensive position as people with </v>

624
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.203
<v Speaker 2>who the wrap their legs around you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're trying to do is just kind </v>

625
00:29:41.171 --> 00:29:43.080
<v Speaker 2>of hold on me to just breathe.</v>

626
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're taking their sweet time.</v>

627
00:29:45.581 --> 00:29:46.414
<v Speaker 2>They're get to breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna relax and then they're </v>

628
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.513
<v Speaker 2>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe try to explode back up to their </v>

629
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:52.870
<v Speaker 2>feet or try to reverse your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to stand up or something like that.</v>

630
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.273
<v Speaker 2>But then there's guys like vinny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to break your arm and </v>

631
00:29:57.531 --> 00:29:58.990
<v Speaker 2>that's immediately what it's going to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

632
00:29:58.991 --> 00:30:00.760
<v Speaker 2>It was going to go to rubber guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

633
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:01.594
<v Speaker 2>Vinnie has like really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous experience when it comes to </v>

634
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:07.983
<v Speaker 2>submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's just super technical and a </v>

635
00:30:11.201 --> 00:30:16.201
<v Speaker 2>big guy like that's a rare combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get caught in that guy's guard,</v>

636
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.860
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

637
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:22.860
<v Speaker 2>you're not favored to get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you underestimated it.</v>

638
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Like that's another thing about guards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you train with a guy,</v>

639
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:31.280
<v Speaker 2>it was like an Eddie Bravo or his guards</v>
<v Speaker 2>just all ultra dangerous.</v>

640
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.930
<v Speaker 2>If you don't train with a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the guys in your gym,</v>

641
00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:38.560
<v Speaker 2>they're not scary from their back so you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it.</v>

642
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're a wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you got good defense,</v>

643
00:30:40.571 --> 00:30:41.440
<v Speaker 2>you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

644
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.470
<v Speaker 2>I see that shit come and nobody gets me </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my gym,</v>

645
00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.440
<v Speaker 2>but they probably don't have the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of guard.</v>

646
00:30:47.441 --> 00:30:48.274
<v Speaker 2>There's some guys out there that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this ridiculously reflect refined level </v>

647
00:30:52.301 --> 00:30:53.910
<v Speaker 2>of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember Paul Sas?</v>

648
00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:55.960
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the guy in the UFC,</v>

649
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.780
<v Speaker 2>he won almost every fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he won one by.</v>

650
00:30:58.781 --> 00:30:59.510
<v Speaker 2>He'll hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

651
00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:00.311
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

652
00:31:00.311 --> 00:31:01.144
<v Speaker 2>he'll hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Johnson who is going to be </v>

653
00:31:03.131 --> 00:31:04.450
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Habib never gotten that off.</v>

654
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.690
<v Speaker 2>But Paul Sas Triangle the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

655
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean he triangled the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

656
00:31:10.601 --> 00:31:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Nobody can get away from his triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just this crazy thing.</v>

657
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.210
<v Speaker 2>If this kid would grab a ahold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd pull guard.</v>

658
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.610
<v Speaker 2>He would get his creep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his legs up over your shoulder.</v>

659
00:31:18.611 --> 00:31:20.740
<v Speaker 2>And before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were choking herself to sleep.</v>

660
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:22.840
<v Speaker 2>She was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

661
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember how many fights he won </v>
<v Speaker 2>by triangle,</v>

662
00:31:25.121 --> 00:31:25.954
<v Speaker 2>but it was so ridiculous because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knew it and he would go out </v>

663
00:31:28.061 --> 00:31:30.160
<v Speaker 2>there and he would do it and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

664
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.720
<v Speaker 2>just stay the fuck away from his </v>
<v Speaker 2>triangle.</v>

665
00:31:31.721 --> 00:31:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Just stay the fuck away from his </v>
<v Speaker 2>triangle.</v>

666
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on his back and you're like,</v>

667
00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a terrible position to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if a guy's legs are like really good</v>

668
00:31:42.641 --> 00:31:46.300
<v Speaker 2>at doing those movements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your legs are so strong.</v>

669
00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:51.130
<v Speaker 2>There's so much stronger than your arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that we lack is not strength.</v>

670
00:31:51.131 --> 00:31:52.320
<v Speaker 2>It's dexterity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

671
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:53.213
<v Speaker 2>some guys figured that dexterity thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and when you have these high level </v>

672
00:31:57.461 --> 00:31:59.560
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see if you.</v>

673
00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:00.583
<v Speaker 2>That's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one where he won by leg lock </v>

674
00:32:02.231 --> 00:32:04.600
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look how good he is dude.</v>

675
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:06.003
<v Speaker 2>Like when he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he gets guys into a position where </v>

676
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:11.520
<v Speaker 2>they think that they're safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all it is,</v>

677
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.390
<v Speaker 2>is another leg lock to look at that.</v>

678
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh this is nasty shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

679
00:32:16.811 --> 00:32:20.830
<v Speaker 2>so this is my point is that like there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are guys that are super,</v>

680
00:32:20.831 --> 00:32:25.831
<v Speaker 2>super dangerous off their back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be a negative point.</v>

681
00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan has nothing on.</v>

682
00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Has not thrown a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if you mess with him.</v>

683
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got tore up here.</v>

684
00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a bad because if they get</v>
<v Speaker 2>rid of Paul says they get videos,</v>

685
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.950
<v Speaker 2>economy think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't remember.</v>

686
00:32:38.951 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean he didn't win all of his fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a tough,</v>

687
00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 2>tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

688
00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:43.784
<v Speaker 2>his submissions were awesome to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he fucked a lot of guys up off his </v>

689
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 2>back another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is an mma whereas actually,</v>

690
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.190
<v Speaker 2>oh damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nasty.</v>

691
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:53.024
<v Speaker 2>And they tapped right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is an mma where you can get </v>

692
00:32:55.761 --> 00:32:56.594
<v Speaker 2>punched in Abu Dhabi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't even get punched so you can </v>

693
00:33:00.321 --> 00:33:01.154
<v Speaker 2>get much deeper in a position to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>worrying about worrying about being </v>

694
00:33:03.321 --> 00:33:04.790
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable to strikes.</v>

695
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.900
<v Speaker 2>So guys like Gary Tonin was like one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best in the world right now.</v>

696
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:12.410
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm known for his leg locks and he takes</v>

697
00:33:12.411 --> 00:33:13.244
<v Speaker 2>off his back all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to think that that guy gets a </v>

698
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.950
<v Speaker 2>negative point because he's attacking </v>
<v Speaker 2>off of his back to me.</v>

699
00:33:18.951 --> 00:33:19.784
<v Speaker 2>So that's loony as loony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he gets a hold of you and you're in </v>

700
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:23.174
<v Speaker 2>his guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get your knee ripped </v>

701
00:33:24.561 --> 00:33:26.480
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If guys at a knee ripper,</v>

702
00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're all the Donna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her death squad,</v>

703
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:31.940
<v Speaker 2>that's what they call themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know John Donahoe Dude,</v>

704
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.730
<v Speaker 2>he's got like a hundred knee rippers </v>
<v Speaker 2>over there.</v>

705
00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:36.003
<v Speaker 2>Just get super technical leg lock guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>were there and they're all doing it </v>

706
00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.313
<v Speaker 2>primarily off their back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in MMA it's way more dangerous in </v>

707
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:47.420
<v Speaker 2>MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys can punch you.</v>

708
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

709
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.500

<v Speaker 1>told you you given makes me nervous.</v>

710
00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:52.334

<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He beat him in combat.</v>

756
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Sambo before fate or a wind up losing an</v>
<v Speaker 2>MMA.</v>

761

<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

762
00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 2>went on that losing streak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now combat is.</v>

763
00:36:07.531 --> 00:36:08.364
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you show up with fucking </v>

764
00:36:09.001 --> 00:36:10.340
<v Speaker 2>swords and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

766
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.570
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just mma.</v>

767
00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.220
<v Speaker 2>It's MMA with a judo jacket on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

768
00:36:14.221 --> 00:36:15.790
<v Speaker 2>What color?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peach.</v>

769
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.483
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does Chris Herzog is big time </v>

770
00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:22.230
<v Speaker 2>sambo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy comes over and does seminars in</v>

771
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.110
<v Speaker 2>rockchester.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to bad or the other.</v>

772
00:36:25.111 --> 00:36:25.891
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

773
00:36:25.891 --> 00:36:26.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's a bunch of.</v>

774
00:36:26.941 --> 00:36:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that well versed in,</v>

775
00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.130
<v Speaker 2>in Zombot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's two different styles.</v>

776
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Assembling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times people confuse the two of</v>

777
00:36:34.201 --> 00:36:35.160
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

778
00:36:35.161 --> 00:36:39.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one time I was watching a fight and they</v>

779
00:36:39.571 --> 00:36:40.404
<v Speaker 2>were talking about this guy's a sambo </v>
<v Speaker 2>background and the commentator was </v>

780
00:36:44.461 --> 00:36:49.080
<v Speaker 2>saying that he didn't think that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sambo there were strikes,</v>

781
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:53.160
<v Speaker 2>so probably won't be as comfortable with</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting hit because he's a sambo guy,</v>

782
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:54.323
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't realize is he actually </v>

783
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:58.800
<v Speaker 2>came from that combat sambo background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the fate or background,</v>

784
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.660
<v Speaker 2>which is where they would have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

785
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:01.493
<v Speaker 2>Were you ever seen it see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull up combat sambo because it's kind </v>

786
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:04.704
<v Speaker 2>of wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird looking like it's high level </v>

787
00:37:07.111 --> 00:37:07.944
<v Speaker 2>MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have judo jackets on and </v>

788
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:12.660
<v Speaker 2>headgear and they're kicking the shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of each other,</v>

789
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:14.040
<v Speaker 2>punching the shit out of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

790
00:37:14.041 --> 00:37:16.620
<v Speaker 2>it is mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also grappling to.</v>

791
00:37:16.621 --> 00:37:18.080
<v Speaker 2>And they're aided by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

792
00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.220
<v Speaker 2>the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

793
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is weird looking,</v>

794
00:37:25.171 --> 00:37:27.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got a fucking jacket on and they're</v>

795
00:37:27.661 --> 00:37:28.890
<v Speaker 2>doing mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

796
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.480
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't totally make sense.</v>

797
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:34.070
<v Speaker 2>No cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

798
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:35.780
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit son.</v>

799
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a three 62.</v>

800
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

801
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:42.621
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

802
00:37:42.621 --> 00:37:44.750
<v Speaker 2>no cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a lot.</v>

803
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.320
<v Speaker 2>I've been saying this lately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is stupid.</v>

804
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.393
<v Speaker 2>I think cages are stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if we have a floor that's big </v>

805
00:37:52.161 --> 00:37:52.994
<v Speaker 2>enough to have a basketball game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a floor that's big enough for </v>

806
00:37:55.341 --> 00:37:58.130
<v Speaker 2>two days to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

807
00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.880
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put down some mats.</v>

808
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:02.743
<v Speaker 2>No more walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This pushing each other up against the </v>

809
00:38:05.091 --> 00:38:09.620
<v Speaker 2>wall is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're fighting some hallway.</v>

810
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Why are you fighting all go outside out </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the woods.</v>

811
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:18.050
<v Speaker 2>You crazy kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did in Russia,</v>

812
00:38:18.051 --> 00:38:18.884
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a fucking a MMA fight on a </v>

813
00:38:20.421 --> 00:38:23.180
<v Speaker 2>football field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what the fuck were you talking about</v>

814
00:38:23.181 --> 00:38:24.014
<v Speaker 2>and the way in today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would drop some knowledge on me </v>

815
00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:31.460
<v Speaker 2>about some gym where they're fighting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking movie with the black dudes.</v>

816
00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.890
<v Speaker 2>What's that movie that the kid came on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>

817
00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Billy Corbin did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

818
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:36.790
<v Speaker 2>dogfight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

819
00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 2>Then when we told them about dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>

820
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:41.110
<v Speaker 2>and you're talking about some gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said you'd save it for the podcast.</v>

821
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.730
<v Speaker 2>This is what I was telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

822
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.370
<v Speaker 2>do you know what happened with conor </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor and Nate Diaz with a bottle?</v>

823
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.320
<v Speaker 2>They threw water bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic water bottles.</v>

824
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:51.873
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got,</v>

825
00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:53.980
<v Speaker 2>someone might've thrown a monster </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy,</v>

826
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:54.814
<v Speaker 2>can someone throw a can see if it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit you or someone you care about that </v>

827
00:38:59.541 --> 00:39:02.140
<v Speaker 2>would suck the water bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like come on.</v>

828
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got fined a $150,000</v>

829
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:11.110
<v Speaker 2>and it should definitely shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking throw water bottles.</v>

830
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So part of me is like,</v>

831
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:16.210
<v Speaker 2>well if they get discouraged throwing </v>
<v Speaker 2>water bottles,</v>

832
00:39:16.211 --> 00:39:17.500
<v Speaker 2>that shit stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

833
00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:19.930
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but did the altercation,</v>

834
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.120
<v Speaker 2>the altercations probably good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

835
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.340
<v Speaker 2>The altercation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I get excited.</v>

836
00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.353
<v Speaker 2>I see Nate Diaz and conor mcgregor </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming at each other cry and it'll </v>

837
00:39:27.611 --> 00:39:30.160
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No fuck you.</v>

838
00:39:30.161 --> 00:39:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get crazy with each other.</v>

839
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:33.603
<v Speaker 2>It makes you excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that generates a pay per </v>

840
00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:36.810
<v Speaker 2>view buys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think conor stupid.</v>

841
00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't think nate stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're smart.</v>

842
00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.410
<v Speaker 2>I think they know what they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to that kind of stuff.</v>

843
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:43.930
<v Speaker 2>So that's a part of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

844
00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:45.970
<v Speaker 2>did he really think he was gonna hit him</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that water bottle?</v>

845
00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Nate Diaz.</v>

846
00:39:48.641 --> 00:39:49.474
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to hit him with a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck are you going to hit him </v>

847
00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:54.010
<v Speaker 2>with a water bottle that's coming from </v>
<v Speaker 2>300 feet away?</v>

848
00:39:54.011 --> 00:39:56.560
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to move out of the way of</v>

849
00:39:56.561 --> 00:39:58.720
<v Speaker 2>that water bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

850
00:39:58.721 --> 00:39:59.554
<v Speaker 2>I mean what they decide to get upset </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and what they don't decide to get </v>

851
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:06.820
<v Speaker 2>upset about is what's weird about </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletic commissions.</v>

852
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:08.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the things they were talking</v>

853
00:40:08.861 --> 00:40:09.694
<v Speaker 2>about whether or not they were going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>test nate for his vape pen because he </v>

854
00:40:13.301 --> 00:40:16.360
<v Speaker 2>had a cbd vape pen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is cbd,</v>

855
00:40:16.361 --> 00:40:18.400
<v Speaker 2>not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even psychoactive.</v>

856
00:40:18.401 --> 00:40:19.234
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make you high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does alleviate some inflammation </v>

857
00:40:22.331 --> 00:40:23.164
<v Speaker 2>and it provides people that have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>back pain or something like that or </v>

858
00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:29.410
<v Speaker 2>especially after a long fight provides </v>
<v Speaker 2>you with a little relief.</v>

859
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:35.310
<v Speaker 2>But what's crazy is the only reason why </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would want you to not do it.</v>

860
00:40:35.921 --> 00:40:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's not performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>enhancing.</v>

861
00:40:37.871 --> 00:40:40.300
<v Speaker 2>You're not performing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The performance is over.</v>

862
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.090
<v Speaker 2>So are they protecting you from </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>

863
00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Like what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

864
00:40:44.251 --> 00:40:44.860
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

865
00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:45.693
<v Speaker 2>they don't want you to do it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're flaunting the fact that you're </v>

866
00:40:48.611 --> 00:40:51.800
<v Speaker 2>doing it in front of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They piss him after the CBD.</v>

867
00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:53.720
<v Speaker 2>We'll just through smoking that.</v>

868
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.690
<v Speaker 2>I think he had already done his post </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight thing.</v>

869
00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.290
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd do that before you do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>press conference.</v>

870
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know though.</v>

871
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:01.733
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not entirely sure and they might do </v>

872
00:41:03.641 --> 00:41:05.830
<v Speaker 2>it different way differently in </v>
<v Speaker 2>different places,</v>

873
00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:08.860
<v Speaker 2>but either way you're not concerned </v>
<v Speaker 2>about him.</v>

874
00:41:08.861 --> 00:41:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the issue?</v>

875
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the issue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

876
00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.413
<v Speaker 2>it looks bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it look bad that he's that vapors </v>

877
00:41:15.221 --> 00:41:16.740
<v Speaker 2>coming out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's scared of dragons.</v>

878
00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bdo business went the roof then.</v>

879
00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it did and it should and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>should room and wait,</v>

880
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:24.490
<v Speaker 2>wait until it becomes illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're a month away.</v>

881
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.070
<v Speaker 2>When it becomes legal then it's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go nuts.</v>

882
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.350
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be good for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

883
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.200
<v Speaker 2>so they get fucking pissed at him for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

884
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.990
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the connor the fine was so high.</v>

885

<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They won't fucking know.</v>

888
00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:44.150
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100.</v>

<v Speaker 1>One point five on 50.</v>

891
00:41:49.501 --> 00:41:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Don't really put a dent in your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

892
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Next time you won't throw fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottles.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

899
00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.730
<v Speaker 1>They walked away with a ton of loot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good point.</v>

900
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:13.740
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be some type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>repercussion.</v>

901
00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:16.500
<v Speaker 1>One 50 and they can fight again in </v>
<v Speaker 1>November.</v>

907
00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:29.970
<v Speaker 1>La County.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stepped in front of a judge by BIPAP.</v>

908
00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.560
<v Speaker 1>The guy looked at me straight in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

909
00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:32.423
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>your license will give me 50 and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to see you again.</v>

916
00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Now you earn next time and now you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>make up that 1:50.</v>

917
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.450
<v Speaker 1>You're earning at least they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspended for a year.</v>

918
00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

919
00:42:58.770 --> 00:42:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my thought,</v>

920
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:03.810
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think 150 is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got a good charity for it.</v>

921
00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:05.670
<v Speaker 2>The center of the charity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

922
00:43:05.671 --> 00:43:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Instead of going to an athletic </v>
<v Speaker 2>department,</v>

923
00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:08.930
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

924
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:09.763
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure the athletic department </v>
<v Speaker 2>department somewhere that'd be a girl's </v>

925
00:43:12.331 --> 00:43:14.720
<v Speaker 2>soccer team or something like that for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that day.</v>

926
00:43:14.721 --> 00:43:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I know that that's like a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

927
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:18.263
<v Speaker 2>but 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>into their pocket is what pisses you </v>

928
00:43:19.951 --> 00:43:24.000
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they decide to get mad at.</v>

929
00:43:24.001 --> 00:43:25.530
<v Speaker 2>And what they don't decide to get mad </v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

930
00:43:25.531 --> 00:43:28.380
<v Speaker 2>because this is the thing that I found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know,</v>

931
00:43:28.381 --> 00:43:30.540
<v Speaker 2>did you watch when Floyd Day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was doing,</v>

932
00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.433
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was for showtime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were doing one of those behind the </v>

933
00:43:35.431 --> 00:43:36.264
<v Speaker 2>scenes things at his gym and he has what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he calls doghouse fights and I just let </v>

934
00:43:44.191 --> 00:43:48.150
<v Speaker 2>me just say that this kind of thing has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been going on in Jim's forever,</v>

935
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:48.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

936
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.553
<v Speaker 2>They've always had gym wars and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have even set up and this was a thing </v>

937
00:43:53.671 --> 00:43:58.410
<v Speaker 2>that I'm pretty sure it became illegal </v>
<v Speaker 2>in California fairly recently.</v>

938
00:43:58.411 --> 00:43:59.244
<v Speaker 2>Within the last decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stopped allowing people to have </v>

939
00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:04.230
<v Speaker 2>what they call smokers and what a smoker</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

940
00:44:04.231 --> 00:44:05.064
<v Speaker 2>They have organized fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's not really like a lot of </v>

941
00:44:08.791 --> 00:44:12.660
<v Speaker 2>medical on hand only gets paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gets paid paid.</v>

942
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:13.703
<v Speaker 2>But it gives people valuable experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So used to have a lot of them in Muay </v>

943
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Thai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I used to go to them.</v>

944
00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.253
<v Speaker 2>They were cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would set up these little plastic </v>

945
00:44:20.521 --> 00:44:22.620
<v Speaker 2>lawn chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd pay a small amount of money,</v>

946
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:24.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 30 bucks or something like that.</v>

947
00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.613
<v Speaker 2>And you go and you watch all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>amateur fights and a lot of times kids </v>

948
00:44:27.751 --> 00:44:29.790
<v Speaker 2>are pretty fucking talented and it's fun</v>
<v Speaker 2>to watch.</v>

949
00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:35.660
<v Speaker 2>But so always had organized jim fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So essentially what floyd mayweather did</v>

950
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:36.563
<v Speaker 2>was have his own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in house Jim fights like amateur </v>

951
00:44:40.981 --> 00:44:41.814
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they didn't even disguise the fact </v>

952
00:44:44.071 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 2>that it was a competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they weren't trying to,</v>

953
00:44:46.621 --> 00:44:49.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't trying to spar.</v>

954
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Like these guys are having fights and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

955
00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.530
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about how it's to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

956
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.760
<v Speaker 2>It's really crazy.</v>

957
00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.253
<v Speaker 2>And he has these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One guy gets beat up and he's hocked </v>

958
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:08.990
<v Speaker 2>seem rock bonds brother or son Seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rockmont son I believe.</v>

959
00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:13.360
<v Speaker 2>See if you could see if you can google </v>
<v Speaker 2>who the gentleman was.</v>

960
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Comments are saying it was his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his brother,</v>

961
00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.373
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's his brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes more sense because how seem </v>

962
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Rockmont is not that old to have a kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

963
00:45:22.331 --> 00:45:23.710
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

964
00:45:23.711 --> 00:45:24.544
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that developed because he looks like </v>

965
00:45:25.391 --> 00:45:28.870
<v Speaker 2>he's like in his twenties maybe is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

966
00:45:28.871 --> 00:45:33.370
<v Speaker 2>point being so this English guy beats </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

967
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:36.460
<v Speaker 2>seen brock bonds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one brother,</v>

968
00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:37.773
<v Speaker 2>and then the mom comes back with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger brother and the English guy </v>

969
00:45:41.771 --> 00:45:42.604
<v Speaker 2>fights him to all on the same day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting like these 30 minute </v>

970
00:45:47.621 --> 00:45:49.930
<v Speaker 2>rounds just gets crazy</v>

971
00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.460
<v Speaker 2>because during a winter and they put it </v>
<v Speaker 2>on TV.</v>

972
00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean dude,</v>

973
00:45:55.601 --> 00:45:58.340
<v Speaker 2>if there's definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sorry,</v>

974
00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:00.070
<v Speaker 2>the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that Jesus?</v>

975
00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:01.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there is.</v>

976
00:46:01.271 --> 00:46:02.104
<v Speaker 2>I mean there might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean floyd might reward them or </v>

977
00:46:04.361 --> 00:46:07.100
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's,</v>

978
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.220
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy shit and I mean in one way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

979
00:46:09.221 --> 00:46:10.054
<v Speaker 2>this will develop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>develop character and I don't have a </v>

980
00:46:12.491 --> 00:46:14.590
<v Speaker 2>problem with people doing whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide to do.</v>

981
00:46:14.591 --> 00:46:16.360
<v Speaker 2>If somebody wants to fight a 30 minute </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

982
00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:18.423
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to do it if you want </v>

983
00:46:21.401 --> 00:46:22.980
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been doing this.</v>

984
00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Jesus love Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is some Boston when he was</v>

985
00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.510
<v Speaker 2>a brown belt Galley with your buddy </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue that this.</v>

986
00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:29.473
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is I'm not a promoter in </v>

987
00:46:31.061 --> 00:46:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Las Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

988
00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:32.883
<v Speaker 2>That's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big difference and I'm not a </v>

989
00:46:34.271 --> 00:46:36.790
<v Speaker 2>professional fighter on television.</v>

990
00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:38.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

991
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:39.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

992
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.313
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not necessarily saying there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything wrong with what he did because </v>

993
00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:46.630
<v Speaker 2>it is a part of gym culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a part of what's made champions.</v>

994
00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean this kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

995
00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:51.640
<v Speaker 2>this heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these heated battles.</v>

996
00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:52.953
<v Speaker 2>This is a very uncomfortable reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>that elite fighters like floyd </v>

997
00:46:56.351 --> 00:47:01.180
<v Speaker 2>mayweather face like to be that good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be that real.</v>

998
00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:06.690
<v Speaker 2>And for a guy like him to show like </v>
<v Speaker 2>these kind of crazy 30 minute,</v>

999
00:47:07.301 --> 00:47:10.240
<v Speaker 2>no time limit fights in the gym and put </v>
<v Speaker 2>it on tv,</v>

1000
00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.260
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in and I see both sides of it.</v>

1001
00:47:14.261 --> 00:47:15.970
<v Speaker 2>I totally see floyd made with a side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1002
00:47:15.971 --> 00:47:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He feeds off that,</v>

1003
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:18.543
<v Speaker 2>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That mentality is why that motherfucker </v>

1004
00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:22.710
<v Speaker 2>was $49.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero,</v>

1005
00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That mother,</v>

1006
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:27.480
<v Speaker 2>arguably the best boxer ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1007
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:30.220
<v Speaker 2>who got hurt less than floyd mayweather,</v>

1008
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.233
<v Speaker 1>who box people's face off that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was going to kill him better </v>

1009
00:47:34.091 --> 00:47:38.710
<v Speaker 1>than floyd mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he fought my Donna and he found him</v>

1010
00:47:38.711 --> 00:47:42.370
<v Speaker 1>the first time and my daughter caught </v>
<v Speaker 1>him in one of the exchanges,</v>

1011
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.900
<v Speaker 1>like right before the bell rang and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

1012
00:47:43.901 --> 00:47:44.734
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they fought again the second </v>

1013
00:47:46.571 --> 00:47:51.230
<v Speaker 1>time and he just put a clinic on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donna just put a clinic on him.</v>

1014
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.320
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden my donald was fighting a</v>

1015
00:47:53.321 --> 00:47:54.154
<v Speaker 1>totally different guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like floyd had figured out my style or </v>

1016
00:47:58.001 --> 00:48:02.560
<v Speaker 1>decided not to fuck around this fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and decided to really take him seriously</v>

1017
00:48:02.561 --> 00:48:05.960
<v Speaker 1>and really focus on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just beat his ass brother.</v>

1018
00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of ways I agree with a lot of this</v>

1019
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 1>shitty does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1020
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.990
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to him,</v>

1021
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:16.810
<v Speaker 1>his emotion games off the charts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the charts,</v>

1022
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:19.180
<v Speaker 1>he's self promotion games the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>

1023
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:22.330
<v Speaker 1>He's making me more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's made me laugh at night sometimes.</v>

1024
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I've watched this show and he's made me </v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh and it said,</v>

1025
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:27.880
<v Speaker 1>show you watch because you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the dude.</v>

1026
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:29.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1027
00:48:29.681 --> 00:48:31.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I know that I would love him.</v>

1028
00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I bet I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love him.</v>

1029
00:48:33.461 --> 00:48:35.890
<v Speaker 1>He's a psycho and I wanted to fight like</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times.</v>

1030
00:48:35.891 --> 00:48:36.641
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1031
00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:38.230
<v Speaker 1>The proof is in the motherfucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting.</v>

1032
00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:39.363
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1033
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Exactly is in the pudding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them do whatever the fuck he wants.</v>

1034
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:42.993
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get a guy like that unless </v>

<v Speaker 1>he's a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get that $49 unless he's that </v>

1036
00:48:47.531 --> 00:48:50.380

<v Speaker 1>fucking human being that could be in </v>

1038
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:54.940

<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy position to be in,</v>

1039
00:48:54.941 --> 00:48:57.040
<v Speaker 1>to be a young guy and be worth that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1064
00:50:06.371 --> 00:50:07.204
<v Speaker 1>because he put fucking two fingers up </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the game and the owner of the </v>

1065
00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:10.990

<v Speaker 1>what's two fingers,</v>

1067
00:50:12.791 --> 00:50:15.130
<v Speaker 1>you can do two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will lose on TV,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Instead of watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he advertised the towel goes,</v>

1070
00:50:22.951 --> 00:50:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you need these tiles.</v>

1071
00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll like to receive his </v>
<v Speaker 1>company</v>

1072
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.450
<v Speaker 2>the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Landry Fine Hollywood Henderson.</v>

1073
00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:35.570
<v Speaker 2>And after that it was all over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was smoking crack and Bazookas.</v>

1074
00:50:35.571 --> 00:50:40.490
<v Speaker 2>But he won the lottery in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a liar.</v>

1075
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.890
<v Speaker 2>He became a born again Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

1076
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh motherfucker dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1077
00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:51.460
<v Speaker 2>That's a fun story.</v>

1078
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:55.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to be clear about all that </v>

1079
00:50:56.991 --> 00:51:00.230
<v Speaker 2>stuff that I was saying about the floyd </v>
<v Speaker 2>mayweather thing.</v>

1080
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I just think that the athletic </v>
<v Speaker 2>commissions,</v>

1081
00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when they find people and when they</v>

1082
00:51:06.951 --> 00:51:07.784
<v Speaker 2>get mad at people for stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sometimes they do it in a very </v>

1083
00:51:12.261 --> 00:51:15.110
<v Speaker 2>heavy handed way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's kind of obscene.</v>

1084
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Like what happened with vandelay Silva I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think is obscene.</v>

1085
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.260
<v Speaker 2>You know that story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they banned vandelay for life.</v>

1086
00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:23.450
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he ran away from a test,</v>

1087
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.660
<v Speaker 2>which he definitely shouldn't have done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely shouldn't have done.</v>

1088
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:29.480
<v Speaker 2>But if he was on something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't have been on.</v>

1089
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Suspend him as if you caught them for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1090
00:51:32.511 --> 00:51:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Something like suspend him for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1091
00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:38.570
<v Speaker 2>maybe an extra six months because he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dick because he ran away from you.</v>

1092
00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:43.530
<v Speaker 2>But you can't save for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't just take away.</v>

1093
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:45.063
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that isolated incident only </v>

1094
00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:49.650
<v Speaker 2>vandelay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was it the old way?</v>

1095
00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Isolated incident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1096
00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Vandelay wasn't as positive before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1097
00:51:53.541 --> 00:51:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Vandelay has never tested positive for </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever know that.</v>

1098
00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not saying he hasn't done </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like in,</v>

1099
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.950
<v Speaker 2>in pride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1100
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:02.661
<v Speaker 2>ensign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1101
00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:03.494
<v Speaker 2>when he's on here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about his pride contract </v>

1102
00:52:06.011 --> 00:52:08.480
<v Speaker 2>and he said it was and Eve Edwards at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

1103
00:52:08.481 --> 00:52:12.680
<v Speaker 2>It said in capital letters we do not </v>
<v Speaker 2>test first steroids.</v>

1104
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:14.840
<v Speaker 2>They give you a syringe on the house and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1105
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it's not saying that he didn't</v>

1106
00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.770
<v Speaker 2>do them ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he never.</v>

1107
00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Vandelay never tested positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1108
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:24.470
<v Speaker 2>So they had no reason to suspect him </v>
<v Speaker 2>other than,</v>

1109
00:52:24.471 --> 00:52:26.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you follow the sniff test,</v>

1110
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got no.</v>

1111
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.710
<v Speaker 2>There was no proof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1112
00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:33.720
<v Speaker 2>and again that's the only argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's proof or not per se,</v>

1113
00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:35.480
<v Speaker 2>it's not whether or not you think he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>guilty.</v>

1114
00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:36.323
<v Speaker 2>I would say something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had a like good stories </v>

1115
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.120
<v Speaker 2>about hiding from probation officers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1116
00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:47.750
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the test.</v>

1121

1139
00:53:58.590 --> 00:53:59.423
<v Speaker 2>but you have to take into consideration </v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibility that it was not </v>

1140

<v Speaker 2>communicated very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you might be talking about two </v>

00:54:11.131 --> 00:54:11.964
<v Speaker 2>people and he's in Brazil and he's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous so he doesn't know if he's being </v>

1144
00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:18.570
<v Speaker 2>fucked with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know this is real.</v>

1145
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:20.460
<v Speaker 2>If it's random,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they just show up,</v>

1146
00:54:20.461 --> 00:54:21.420
<v Speaker 2>nobody warns you.</v>

1147
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:23.490
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like the UFC calls you up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and says,</v>

1148
00:54:23.491 --> 00:54:25.140
<v Speaker 2>Joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you man?</v>

1149
00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:25.974
<v Speaker 2>It's Mike from the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to let you know that this </v>

1150
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:31.710
<v Speaker 2>guy who was testing you right now for </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids is totally legit.</v>

1151
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:32.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just show up,</v>

1152
00:54:32.641 --> 00:54:33.474
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just show up and they don't even </v>

1153
00:54:34.231 --> 00:54:35.064
<v Speaker 2>want to present you with information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to present you with id </v>

1154
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:38.393
<v Speaker 2>like Chael Sonnen was telling a story </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how when they tested him and how </v>

1155
00:54:40.981 --> 00:54:41.814
<v Speaker 2>bizarre it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they say they pulled them into a </v>

1156
00:54:43.261 --> 00:54:45.120
<v Speaker 2>bathroom or something like that to test </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1157
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1158
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.390
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a janitor's closet or something.</v>

1159
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:50.430
<v Speaker 2>They tested them in a janitor's closet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>

1160
00:54:50.431 --> 00:54:52.370
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're drawing my blood.</v>

1161
00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:55.080
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned out to actually be Usada.</v>

1162
00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:55.943
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could easily have been just some </v>

1163
00:54:56.851 --> 00:55:00.030
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy person who just wanted my </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood and my piss,</v>

1164
00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:00.900
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1165
00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>

1166
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not what happened with Tim Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened with him?</v>

1167
00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.120
<v Speaker 2>That they went over to his house and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>came home from the gym.</v>

1168
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.871
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1169
00:55:09.871 --> 00:55:11.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy made him take a shower.</v>

1170
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:13.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to read the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1171
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.620
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't do the test for like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour for some reason.</v>

1172
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the reason was.</v>

1173
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:20.633
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe the guy had to get the test </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought over or something and the guy </v>

1174
00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:25.380
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to keep an eye on it.</v>

1175
00:55:25.381 --> 00:55:26.131
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really well,</v>

1176
00:55:26.131 --> 00:55:26.964
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1177
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.103
<v Speaker 2>I might take a shower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got done training and that's </v>

1178
00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:31.680
<v Speaker 2>actually if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're doing Jujitsu,</v>

1179
00:55:31.681 --> 00:55:32.514
<v Speaker 2>it's actually really important that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>jump in the shower because you get </v>

1180
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:38.010
<v Speaker 2>scratches and those scratches on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

1181
00:55:38.011 --> 00:55:38.844
<v Speaker 2>You can get staff on those and staff </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives in your nose and it lives in </v>

1182
00:55:42.721 --> 00:55:46.380
<v Speaker 2>saliva and it lives in like when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing Jujitsu,</v>

1183
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:51.390
<v Speaker 2>you're awash in bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hold weapon.</v>

1184
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Gunpoint is this guy showed up in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>driveway.</v>

1185
00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:58.140
<v Speaker 2>When is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an August.</v>

1186
00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Demands to know who he is.</v>

1187
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:03.330
<v Speaker 2>A little story on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1188
00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.710
<v Speaker 2>These motherfuckers are coming over like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cubes to your house.</v>

1189
00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.420
<v Speaker 2>If you ever drive down Tim Kennedy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>block mixture.</v>

1190
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:10.780
<v Speaker 2>He knows who the hell you are.</v>

1191
00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.700
<v Speaker 2>They come on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that shit y'all.</v>

1192
00:56:17.701 --> 00:56:21.900
<v Speaker 2>You can't pull up slowly pulling up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy's driveway and parking his car.</v>

1193
00:56:21.901 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 2>The side of the collector was at the</v>

1194
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.030
<v Speaker 3>wrong end of a barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1195
00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:31.240
<v Speaker 3>He demanded know who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like Kennedy is cleaning up the</v>

1196
00:56:31.241 --> 00:56:34.840
<v Speaker 3>streets as you saw to tries to clean and</v>
<v Speaker 3>professional mixed martial arts.</v>

1197
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:39.930
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1198
00:56:40.141 --> 00:56:40.974
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saying that he thought that Usada Rep </v>

1199
00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:45.300
<v Speaker 3>might be a terrorist disguised as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>urine collector.</v>

1200
00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:48.740
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

1201
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:50.503
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a dangerous guy to sneak up on </v>

1202
00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:52.280
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>GotTa.</v>

1203
00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:53.180
<v Speaker 3>Be Real careful.</v>

1204
00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:59.690
<v Speaker 3>That's not a guy you want to fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's gotta be a little Diaz.</v>

1205
00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.193
<v Speaker 3>Didn't let him in stone sleep and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people don't like the idea of just </v>

1206
00:57:07.591 --> 00:57:08.424
<v Speaker 3>being stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to always worry about </v>

1207
00:57:10.381 --> 00:57:11.214
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an added element that you think </v>

1208
00:57:12.451 --> 00:57:15.000
<v Speaker 3>of that you have to be stopped in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of your sleep.</v>

1209
00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:16.043
<v Speaker 3>Someone can wake you up at 7:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning thing done and you have </v>

1210
00:57:19.561 --> 00:57:23.040
<v Speaker 3>to give them blood and piss right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to deal.</v>

1211
00:57:23.041 --> 00:57:27.230
<v Speaker 3>So you've lost lot and I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1212
00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.690
<v Speaker 3>I think at the very least are tasting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're testing blood.</v>

1213
00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:35.330
<v Speaker 3>I know Nevada was doing urine to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1214
00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:36.173
<v Speaker 3>if they're still doing urine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the more stringent tests apparently </v>

1215
00:57:40.891 --> 00:57:42.690
<v Speaker 3>are all blood based,</v>

1216
00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:45.330
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1217
00:57:45.331 --> 00:57:47.790
<v Speaker 3>you have to give them a schedule where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going with time.</v>

1218
00:57:47.791 --> 00:57:49.770
<v Speaker 3>You're training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cowboy got in trouble.</v>

1219
00:57:49.771 --> 00:57:50.910
<v Speaker 3>That's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's tough.</v>

1220
00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Probably got in trouble because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>said we're at your ranch.</v>

1221
00:57:53.041 --> 00:57:53.610
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1222
00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:57.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm at the UFC and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to let us know where you going.</v>

1223
00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:57.720
<v Speaker 3>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1224
00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:00.090
<v Speaker 3>doesn't the UFC tell you I'm going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>

1225
00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:01.650
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where I'm going.</v>

1226
00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm promoting the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here for the UFC.</v>

1227
00:58:04.411 --> 00:58:06.630
<v Speaker 3>I got a fight coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm there.</v>

1228
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:07.783
<v Speaker 3>Like they didn't tell you I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be there and so they have to warn him </v>

1229
00:58:10.261 --> 00:58:11.094
<v Speaker 3>and give him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a bad boy because we didn't know </v>

1230
00:58:13.051 --> 00:58:14.250
<v Speaker 3>where you were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll send someone here,</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1233
00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:17.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he apparently he had to like give </v>

1234
00:58:18.961 --> 00:58:21.540
<v Speaker 3>them his schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no matter where you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know I'm going to go fishing,</v>

1236
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:25.500

<v Speaker 3>get tracked.</v>

<v Speaker 3>people from doing steroids.</v>

1248
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Can I track them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Track them.</v>

1249
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Like you're going to follow them with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>drone.</v>

1250
00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.530
<v Speaker 3>When they came to my house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a criminal.</v>

1251
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:06.630
<v Speaker 3>I'd given up my right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1252
00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:10.020
<v Speaker 3>it's so fucking bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they would show up.</v>

1253
00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:12.740
<v Speaker 3>This one dude had it out for me because </v>

<v Speaker 3>So now there's little southern guy would</v>
<v Speaker 3>come to me,</v>

1256
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 3>show up at my job.</v>

1257
00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Fucking everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1258
00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Like twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave him pissed,</v>

1259
00:59:26.911 --> 00:59:29.540
<v Speaker 1>but at least I got to talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he wasn't a bad guy,</v>

1260
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:30.403
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't like a heavy at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one time I just wouldn't let them </v>

1261
00:59:33.801 --> 00:59:34.634
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he followed me for a probation </v>

1262
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:37.790
<v Speaker 1>violation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I proved that wasn't.</v>

1263
00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:42.791
<v Speaker 1>That was at the airport and so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's when someone,</v>

1264
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:45.670
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it no more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do that.</v>

1265
00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:48.980
<v Speaker 1>That would put you in a weird position </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that person.</v>

1266
00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:50.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea.</v>

1267
00:59:50.271 --> 00:59:53.570
<v Speaker 1>There's people who come out of prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put them in that situation and they</v>

1268
00:59:53.571 --> 00:59:56.030
<v Speaker 1>fail and they go right back to prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll tell you,</v>

1269
00:59:56.031 --> 00:59:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I never want to be in a halfway house </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation again because it's too,</v>

1270
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really freedom.</v>

1271
01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not really freedom in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1272
01:00:04.611 --> 01:00:08.930
<v Speaker 1>at that level of sharing their weaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>you off of freedom.</v>

1273
01:00:08.931 --> 01:00:10.580
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's a halfway house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1274
01:00:10.581 --> 01:00:11.031
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1275
01:00:11.031 --> 01:00:12.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm at the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I leave work.</v>

1276
01:00:12.561 --> 01:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>I got to call them and say I'm headed </v>
<v Speaker 1>over to a 10th planet HQ.</v>

1277
01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.650
<v Speaker 1>What's the address?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six O two,</v>

1278
01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as I'm leaving now,</v>

1279
01:00:19.901 --> 01:00:21.140
<v Speaker 1>let's say you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1280
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:22.483
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go over across the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a protein shake and when you go </v>

1281
01:00:25.161 --> 01:00:25.994
<v Speaker 1>over to their places closed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he'd go next door or something like </v>

1282
01:00:28.551 --> 01:00:29.840
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can violate you for that.</v>

1283
01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough to,</v>

1284
01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:36.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no Bible.</v>

1285
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:37.843
<v Speaker 1>It's working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's working and it makes you </v>

1286
01:00:40.131 --> 01:00:41.080
<v Speaker 1>accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1287
01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.340
<v Speaker 1>It makes you accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Important thing when you're,</v>

1288
01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:44.213
<v Speaker 1>you're definitely gonna eliminate 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>something percent of the people that'd </v>

1289
01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:50.210
<v Speaker 1>be willing to take a chance and take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>steroid.</v>

1290
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.433
<v Speaker 1>But then there's always the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's people that are ahead of </v>

1291
01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:56.380
<v Speaker 1>the curve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1292
01:00:56.381 --> 01:00:58.160
<v Speaker 1>like we can't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1293
01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.160
<v Speaker 1>all those times when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1294
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:01.123
<v Speaker 1>had that clear stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Victor Conte was using that stuff </v>

1295
01:01:04.071 --> 01:01:04.904
<v Speaker 1>on his athletes that was undetectable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would call it the clear and then </v>

1296
01:01:08.451 --> 01:01:11.480
<v Speaker 1>they figured out what the clear was and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now now you can test for it.</v>

1297
01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>But back then nobody had a test for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once,</v>

1298
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:15.343
<v Speaker 1>once they find tests for whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck people are using now that are </v>

1299
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:19.730
<v Speaker 1>skirting around tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go,</v>

1300
01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.470
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought those guys were clean.</v>

1301
01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Like there's going to be a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage,</v>

1302
01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>whatever that percentage is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's 10 percent.</v>

1303
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be a percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's trying something.</v>

1304
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:33.680
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be a percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's willing to try something.</v>

1305
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:36.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just out of all the people that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know are clean,</v>

1306
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:36.913
<v Speaker 1>if there's 100 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it one guy that takes a chance and </v>

1307
01:01:39.681 --> 01:01:40.514
<v Speaker 1>does something weird and then gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught a few years later when they </v>

1308
01:01:43.221 --> 01:01:44.054
<v Speaker 1>figured out a test for it might be fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coffee was taken into the different </v>

1309
01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:47.290
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1310
01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:49.750
<v Speaker 1>he was in the sixth day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1312
01:01:51.371 --> 01:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would be out of your system.</v>

1313
01:01:53.311 --> 01:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1314
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.540
<v Speaker 1>in the sixth inning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let me ask you a question.</v>

1315
01:01:56.541 --> 01:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>I know you're not going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Jamie's been watching lately.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But he was a junkie and he was a piece </v>

<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 73.</v>

1372
01:04:41.881 --> 01:04:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I was 10 years old and I went to see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mets against the Cincinnati reds.</v>

1373
01:04:45.721 --> 01:04:48.960
<v Speaker 1>I was in my fucking haven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the fucking all star game.</v>

1374
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>It was the National League,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1375
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Eastern Conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he beat up.</v>

1376
01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.480
<v Speaker 1>But housing the second I left there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at us.</v>

1377
01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I left there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fucking happy.</v>

1378
01:04:59.371 --> 01:05:01.790
<v Speaker 1>I went there with my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my stepdad.</v>

1379
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.800
<v Speaker 1>We was sitting behind Tony Perez family </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Pete rose is beaten up on bud house.</v>

1380
01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:09.370
<v Speaker 1>And I left there with my fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dickhead.</v>

1381
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:13.020
<v Speaker 1>That chicken pox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the chicken pox.</v>

1382
01:05:13.021 --> 01:05:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I went to that game with the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken pox.</v>

1383
01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>So here's my question to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come this can happen today?</v>

<v Speaker 1>How come the guy can't run into the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>at home base today?</v>

1385
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:27.990
<v Speaker 1>That would be a suspension three months </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for suspension is nothing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just getting good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>book that here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to do?</v>

1452

<v Speaker 1>Why they keep gambling like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Illegal.</v>

1455
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they're worried we're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go crazy.</v>

1456
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Just gambled all the money away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are they worried about?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like why is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1458
01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Why would you protect someone from </v>
<v Speaker 1>gambling?</v>

1459
01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Wait you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you trying to keep people prosperous</v>

1460
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.850
<v Speaker 1>by removing the threat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't do it.</v>

1461
01:08:34.851 --> 01:08:35.684
<v Speaker 1>So because they can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people who'd fallen into </v>

1462
01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:37.874
<v Speaker 1>gambling won't because we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect them from themselves because </v>

1463
01:08:40.341 --> 01:08:41.870
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't seem to make any sense to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1464
01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Some states look upon it like when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kid,</v>

1465
01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:45.723
<v Speaker 1>no reasonable.</v>

1466
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.820
<v Speaker 1>because they gave you a ticket in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city and a felony in jersey,</v>

1467
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.313
<v Speaker 1>so we'll wait a second.</v>

1468
01:08:53.621 --> 01:08:54.454
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers in the tristate area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're telling me is if you got </v>

1469
01:08:57.351 --> 01:09:01.040
<v Speaker 1>arrested for gambling in New York City </v>

1470
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.963
<v Speaker 1>you got a ticket.</v>

1471
01:09:03.690 --> 01:09:05.100
<v Speaker 1>The Cop said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do?</v>

1472
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:06.743
<v Speaker 1>I've got a thousand of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers popping apartment </v>

1473
01:09:08.341 --> 01:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>buildings all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you went to Harlem in the seventies,</v>

1474
01:09:11.821 --> 01:09:14.220
<v Speaker 1>it was all little bodegas and everybody </v>

01:09:17.190 --> 01:09:19.220
<v Speaker 1>the Brooklyn number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Roosevelt number.</v>

1477
01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Remember there's five numbers that come </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and fucking New York.</v>

1478
01:09:22.530 --> 01:09:24.180
<v Speaker 1>They haven't told you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother got arrested.</v>

1479
01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1480
01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.173
<v Speaker 1>You run numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you do in the </v>

1481
01:09:28.141 --> 01:09:30.180
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You become a part of it.</v>

1482
01:09:30.181 --> 01:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>You gotta accept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1483

1571
01:13:19.651 --> 01:13:24.000
<v Speaker 1>fence and take over the sneakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No mistakes.</v>

1572
01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Irregulars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would take those and just sell them</v>

<v Speaker 1>think it's a bathroom.</v>

1616
01:15:51.251 --> 01:15:52.084
<v Speaker 1>got into martial arts I didn't want to </v>

1617
01:15:54.461 --> 01:15:56.650
<v Speaker 1>of martial arts because I didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get hurt.</v>

1618
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:59.770
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't want to ski.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to ride motorcycles,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to skate.</v>

1620
01:16:01.361 --> 01:16:03.730
<v Speaker 1>I didn't rollerskate I didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did an ice skate.</v>

1621
01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to ice skate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1622
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:07.960
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bowled.</v>

1623
01:16:08.650 --> 01:16:10.870
<v Speaker 1>I got a bowling ball at some point in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the game.</v>

1624
01:16:10.871 --> 01:16:12.940
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go to the Bronx and bowl.</v>

1625
01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:14.463
<v Speaker 1>I rolled a skate if I went like three </v>
<v Speaker 1>times in the seventh grade and like a </v>

1626
01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Paramus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paramus,</v>

1627
01:16:19.901 --> 01:16:21.580
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like a roller rink.</v>

1628
01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:26.290
<v Speaker 1>And it was the one that was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1629
01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Staying alive and yeah.</v>

1630
01:16:28.670 --> 01:16:32.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first I was afraid I was petrified he,</v>

1631
01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:33.663
<v Speaker 1>Brett would do this bit and he would do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it with music and they would flash the </v>

1632
01:16:38.471 --> 01:16:40.420
<v Speaker 1>lights and shit and he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1633
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he does anymore.</v>

1634
01:16:43.061 --> 01:16:44.950
<v Speaker 1>But if you haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go find it.</v>

1635
01:16:44.951 --> 01:16:47.020
<v Speaker 1>If it's online somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's serious.</v>

1636
01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.033
<v Speaker 1>I used to go to the one and I took me </v>
<v Speaker 1>were older than I was and for me it was </v>

1637
01:16:53.021 --> 01:16:53.854
<v Speaker 1>just to skate around for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was to pick up checks you following </v>

1638
01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:01.720
<v Speaker 1>me and they would get all dressed up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and then they would roll around and</v>

1639
01:17:01.721 --> 01:17:03.840
<v Speaker 1>if you want up to a girl and ask her to </v>
<v Speaker 1>roller skate.</v>

1640
01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:05.470
<v Speaker 1>That was the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

1641
01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:06.813
<v Speaker 1>that type of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they played disco music and I went </v>

1642
01:17:09.471 --> 01:17:11.000
<v Speaker 1>like three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't for me,</v>

1643
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:12.120
<v Speaker 1>but the best thing.</v>

1644
01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I had a wig and he fell and the weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>fell off everybody surrounding them.</v>

1645
01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:19.550
<v Speaker 1>And that was my highlight of the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>roller skating rink.</v>

1646
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:24.050
<v Speaker 1>I never went back to the this game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you know?</v>

1648
01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:26.443

<v Speaker 1>you knew that you were going to be a </v>

<v Speaker 1>But did you ever like look back at </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments like that where the guy falls </v>

1651
01:17:35.841 --> 01:17:36.674
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wig falls off and it's a fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>absurd.</v>

1657
01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Like when I saw a guy get him on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>snowball in New York City on a bus,</v>

1658
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:54.403
<v Speaker 1>like when people throw snowballs at each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and I was in the back of the bus </v>

1659
01:17:57.291 --> 01:17:58.124
<v Speaker 1>and this guy sat in the area where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get hit with snowballs and the </v>

1660
01:18:00.861 --> 01:18:01.694
<v Speaker 1>window was open.</v>

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker's going to get hit.</v>

1662
01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:05.114
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like Deja Vu and all of a sudden </v>

1663
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:09.590
<v Speaker 1>sitting in the back of the bus and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy's happy.</v>

1666
01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:14.420

<v Speaker 1>He was like a tourist.</v>

1667
01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:15.593
<v Speaker 1>He was a tourist Italian and it was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day after the storm and these coasts </v>

1668
01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.410
<v Speaker 1>where it's sunny out and that snow's </v>
<v Speaker 1>melting,</v>

1669
01:18:21.411 --> 01:18:23.170
<v Speaker 1>but kids are rapping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have school and they're throwing</v>

1670
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.970
<v Speaker 1>snowballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to the boulevard and this guy gets</v>

1671
01:18:25.971 --> 01:18:27.620
<v Speaker 1>on the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't close the window.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Then it becomes like apocalypse now.</v>

1675
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:36.303
<v Speaker 1>Then when they threw spears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then when they went on the lake and </v>

<v Speaker 1>snowballs and I saw at Joe Rogan,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The raiders game,</v>

1708
01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where some guy got beaten into a coma.</v>

1709
01:20:23.530 --> 01:20:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Critical.</v>

1710
01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was an earlier this month,</v>

1711
01:20:25.281 --> 01:20:26.114
<v Speaker 4>October.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was in critical condition after a </v>

1712
01:20:28.041 --> 01:20:29.060
<v Speaker 4>ravens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>raiders game,</v>

1713
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:33.260
<v Speaker 4>30 percent chance to survive and two </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys got arrested.</v>

1714
01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just beat him up.</v>

1715
01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:36.513
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know what the story was at </v>

1716
01:20:37.581 --> 01:20:38.414
<v Speaker 4>the time of this was written.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was unclear why the altercation </v>

1717
01:20:40.311 --> 01:20:41.144
<v Speaker 4>started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just started fighting on their way </v>

1718
01:20:42.081 --> 01:20:42.914
<v Speaker 4>out the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom knows then who knows what happened </v>

1719
01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.700
<v Speaker 4>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it two on one,</v>

1720
01:20:49.701 --> 01:20:50.534
<v Speaker 4>but I mean who even knows what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what we're talking about the </v>

1721
01:20:53.961 --> 01:20:57.250
<v Speaker 4>violence that these games from Russia </v>
<v Speaker 4>came to this.</v>

1722
01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:00.240
<v Speaker 4>Is that a preseason at a game?</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the coliseum.</v>

1723
01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:04.250
<v Speaker 4>Just fans brutally fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's happened all.</v>

1724
01:21:04.890 --> 01:21:05.750
<v Speaker 4>All,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>

1725
01:21:05.751 --> 01:21:07.410
<v Speaker 4>I like any stadium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just pick a stadium.</v>

1726
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:08.720
<v Speaker 4>Just going to be fights there basically.</v>

1727
01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

1728
01:21:10.241 --> 01:21:13.120
<v Speaker 1>This guy just dragged this guy that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>other guy was beaten up.</v>

1729
01:21:13.121 --> 01:21:13.954
<v Speaker 1>He dragged the guy over the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs and then he started beating him </v>

1730
01:21:16.031 --> 01:21:18.580
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1731
01:21:18.581 --> 01:21:21.430
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>

1732
01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:24.490
<v Speaker 1>And there's no security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where the fuck is security?</v>

1733
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the preseason game with the rams,</v>

1734
01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:28.053
<v Speaker 1>there was no this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened and something else </v>

1735
01:21:29.381 --> 01:21:30.214
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess the rams didn't want to pay </v>

1736
01:21:31.841 --> 01:21:32.674
<v Speaker 1>up and the city didn't want to pay up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess the rams ended up having to </v>

1737
01:21:35.981 --> 01:21:39.280
<v Speaker 1>pay up the security at these games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1738
01:21:39.281 --> 01:21:44.281
<v Speaker 1>A raiders games particularly violent or </v>
<v Speaker 1>is it all sports games?</v>

1739
01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this point,</v>

1740
01:21:46.211 --> 01:21:47.044
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck really knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple dodger games and then </v>

1741
01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:50.973
<v Speaker 1>not violent at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about shit will philly in the old </v>

1742
01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:55.713
<v Speaker 1>days?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about this new stadium now </v>

1743
01:21:56.381 --> 01:21:57.214

1745
01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:03.633
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last couple of years it's like </v>

<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two cops coming between you.</v>

1748

<v Speaker 1>find the killers.</v>

1756
01:22:33.601 --> 01:22:36.120
<v Speaker 1>So they went to the tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they narrowed it all the way down</v>

1781

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:34.070
<v Speaker 3>versus like gladiators to like some </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy football game.</v>

1822
01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just,</v>

1823
01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:40.670
<v Speaker 3>there's no way we want to slide back </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sword fighting shit again.</v>

1824
01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:45.030
<v Speaker 3>If that would be the one thing like </v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1825
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:45.873
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing I noticed the last couple of </v>

1826
01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:48.613
<v Speaker 3>weeks because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the year I don't really sit and </v>

1827
01:25:50.010 --> 01:25:50.843
<v Speaker 3>watch baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's around the world series that I'll </v>

1828
01:25:52.191 --> 01:25:53.930
<v Speaker 3>watch a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the other thing,</v>

1829
01:25:53.931 --> 01:25:56.240
<v Speaker 3>the green room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're watching it now,</v>

1830
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:59.960
<v Speaker 3>they even have like Joel pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jaw piece,</v>

1831
01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.073
<v Speaker 3>tons of protection now like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're batter of you get hit with </v>

1832
01:26:04.221 --> 01:26:04.881
<v Speaker 3>a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1833
01:26:04.881 --> 01:26:07.240
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a battery or a right handed</v>
<v Speaker 3>batter,</v>

1834
01:26:07.570 --> 01:26:09.980
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your helmet now comes down to here.</v>

1835
01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:12.800
<v Speaker 3>So all you could see as the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1836
01:26:12.801 --> 01:26:14.040
<v Speaker 3>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if the blue.</v>

1837
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these jaw got broken or </v>

1838
01:26:15.901 --> 01:26:16.734
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're looking to protect your pete </v>

1839
01:26:18.651 --> 01:26:21.470
<v Speaker 3>rose's game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a fucking gladiator.</v>

1840
01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.560
<v Speaker 3>But when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that's when that guy,</v>

1841
01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:26.630
<v Speaker 3>Tony Conigliaro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that his name,</v>

1842
01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.540
<v Speaker 3>the guy who got hit with a ball.</v>

1843
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:30.703
<v Speaker 3>Who's the guy that got hit with a ball?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a big player in the Boston Red </v>

1844
01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:35.803
<v Speaker 3>Sox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got hit with a ball and was never </v>

1845
01:26:37.641 --> 01:26:40.760
<v Speaker 3>the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Sam wasn't a fucking.</v>

1846
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:43.850
<v Speaker 3>I was a baseball fan until I started </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts,</v>

1847
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:48.470
<v Speaker 3>so till I was like 14 or 15 and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget the story,</v>

1848
01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:49.700
<v Speaker 3>but I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1849
01:26:49.701 --> 01:26:52.210
<v Speaker 3>I did not know a baseball could fuck you</v>
<v Speaker 3>up that bad.</v>

1850
01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:55.400
<v Speaker 3>This guy was essentially net Tony </v>
<v Speaker 3>Conigliaro.</v>

1851
01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:56.061
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1852
01:26:56.061 --> 01:26:59.960
<v Speaker 3>So he got hit with his baseball and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just never the same again.</v>

1853
01:26:59.961 --> 01:27:04.961
<v Speaker 3>And he was a star player before he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit and sort of never recovered.</v>

1854
01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:09.740
<v Speaker 3>Was All fucked up afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>

1855
01:27:09.741 --> 01:27:11.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember when he died,</v>

1856
01:27:11.991 --> 01:27:15.330
<v Speaker 3>but I believe he died young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 an hour,</v>

1857
01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:19.010
<v Speaker 3>80 year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>state even faster.</v>

1858
01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:20.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some guys like Roger Clemens.</v>

1859
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:24.590
<v Speaker 3>What would you throw in his prime in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>800?</v>

1860
01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:26.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was the seventies,</v>

1861
01:27:26.271 --> 01:27:27.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:29.450
<v Speaker 3>So the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they still weren't the,</v>

1863
01:27:29.930 --> 01:27:30.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was still growing.</v>

1864
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:31.843
<v Speaker 3>Ada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the technology might have been a </v>

1865
01:27:33.171 --> 01:27:34.310
<v Speaker 3>little wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1866
01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.450
<v Speaker 3>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't a lot of steroids.</v>

1867
01:27:36.451 --> 01:27:39.140
<v Speaker 3>So many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to just still.</v>

1868
01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:40.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>

1869
01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to.</v>

1870
01:27:42.111 --> 01:27:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were you going to say,</v>

1871
01:27:43.401 --> 01:27:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

1872
01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.860
<v Speaker 4>The guy closes for the cubs that pitches</v>
<v Speaker 4>last night.</v>

1873
01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:49.080
<v Speaker 4>Chapman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's throwing 102 miles an hour.</v>

1874
01:27:49.290 --> 01:27:53.830
<v Speaker 4>Fast balls on Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was fast.</v>

1875
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:59.470
<v Speaker 4>It breaks bats and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's so fast.</v>

1876
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:04.050
<v Speaker 4>That hits your kneecap at that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just shattered it.</v>

1877
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:05.760
<v Speaker 4>Let's chat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it</v>

1878
01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:08.560
<v Speaker 3>crazy ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1879
01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.433
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have ability to take a baseball bat </v>

1880
01:28:10.591 --> 01:28:14.850
<v Speaker 3>and base our baseball rather and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically held something in the head.</v>

1881
01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:15.893
<v Speaker 3>You could throw it like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could throw a baseball at a dog and </v>

1882
01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:20.023
<v Speaker 3>Kol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you want it to that kind of </v>

1883
01:28:23.341 --> 01:28:26.910
<v Speaker 3>accuracy and speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1884
01:28:26.911 --> 01:28:27.744
<v Speaker 3>they think that might've been one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons why human beings evolved like </v>

1885
01:28:30.421 --> 01:28:31.530
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our brains evolved.</v>

1886
01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:32.633
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the considerations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're trying to figure out which </v>

1887
01:28:34.690 --> 01:28:35.523
<v Speaker 3>what causes the brain to double.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our brain doubled over a period of 2 </v>

1888
01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:39.561
<v Speaker 3>million years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's,</v>

1889
01:28:39.561 --> 01:28:41.460
<v Speaker 3>it's just giant mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know why.</v>

1890
01:28:41.730 --> 01:28:43.560
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of thoughts as to why </v>
<v Speaker 3>did it.</v>

1891
01:28:43.561 --> 01:28:46.860
<v Speaker 3>People started eating more meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started cooking their meat.</v>

1892
01:28:46.861 --> 01:28:49.110
<v Speaker 3>They get get them more access to </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrients,</v>

1893
01:28:49.230 --> 01:28:50.063
<v Speaker 3>but another weird one is they think it </v>
<v Speaker 3>might've had something to do with the </v>

1894
01:28:52.291 --> 01:28:53.124
<v Speaker 3>throwing arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then when people figured out that they </v>

1895
01:28:55.321 --> 01:28:56.154
<v Speaker 3>could pick stuff up and throw it at </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that they started getting </v>

1896
01:28:58.711 --> 01:29:01.410
<v Speaker 3>clever and that's when they started </v>
<v Speaker 3>devising</v>

1897
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:02.813
<v Speaker 2>solutions to problems and it gave them </v>
<v Speaker 2>more access to food because they could </v>

1898
01:29:05.461 --> 01:29:06.294
<v Speaker 2>kill animals better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were throwing rocks like </v>

1899
01:29:07.981 --> 01:29:08.814
<v Speaker 2>squirrels and shit and eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you mean to tell me it's on its </v>

1900
01:29:11.401 --> 01:29:12.234
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our brain has doubled in size over a </v>

1901
01:29:14.611 --> 01:29:17.790
<v Speaker 2>period of 2 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The human brain doubled,</v>

1902
01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:21.510
<v Speaker 2>was a long met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that was a long time ago.</v>

1903
01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:23.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's more information.</v>

1904
01:29:23.970 --> 01:29:24.803
<v Speaker 2>There was no books back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was during the time that human </v>

1905
01:29:27.271 --> 01:29:29.760
<v Speaker 2>brain doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were basically going from these,</v>

1906
01:29:29.761 --> 01:29:30.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1907
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:34.830
<v Speaker 2>more primitive hominids to becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 2>human being.</v>

1908
01:29:34.831 --> 01:29:39.831
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a sort of a period </v>
<v Speaker 2>where things move along at a fairly slow</v>

1909
01:29:39.991 --> 01:29:40.824
<v Speaker 2>pace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then all of a sudden something </v>

1910
01:29:41.671 --> 01:29:44.130
<v Speaker 2>explodes over what seems like a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1911
01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.610
<v Speaker 2>but 2 million years is not that long in </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary terms.</v>

1912
01:29:47.970 --> 01:29:48.803
<v Speaker 2>So something happened when we were some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of monkey creature and during that </v>

1913
01:29:52.801 --> 01:29:56.700
<v Speaker 2>time there was a change where we mutated</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our brain,</v>

1914
01:29:56.730 --> 01:29:59.700
<v Speaker 2>doubled in size and we became way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated.</v>

1915
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:01.103
<v Speaker 2>No Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Fun Shit is to think that that was </v>

1916
01:30:02.911 --> 01:30:03.744
<v Speaker 2>aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Fun Shit is to think that aliens </v>

1917
01:30:05.431 --> 01:30:08.040
<v Speaker 2>came down and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1918
01:30:08.250 --> 01:30:10.890
<v Speaker 2>put sperm and a monkey or did some tests</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1919
01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:13.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took one of the early primates and added</v>

1920
01:30:13.561 --> 01:30:14.394
<v Speaker 2>alien DNA to it and dropped it back off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why the brain got so big so </v>

1921
01:30:17.581 --> 01:30:19.170
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

1922
01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.610
<v Speaker 2>we've figured some shit out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1923
01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:22.080
<v Speaker 2>And the people that didn't figure it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1924
01:30:22.081 --> 01:30:23.520
<v Speaker 2>they didn't live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1925
01:30:23.530 --> 01:30:27.780
<v Speaker 2>we probably figured out high spaces keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>you away from cats,</v>

1926
01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:28.653
<v Speaker 2>got to climb up high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to figure out how to invent </v>

1927
01:30:30.751 --> 01:30:33.360
<v Speaker 2>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta like soft.</v>

1928
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't.</v>

1929
01:30:34.681 --> 01:30:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't get the fangs.</v>

1930
01:30:36.210 --> 01:30:37.043
<v Speaker 2>We didn't get the claws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've got the crazy brain and we </v>

1931
01:30:39.391 --> 01:30:40.224
<v Speaker 2>went to crazy brain option over 2 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million years somehow or another for </v>

1932
01:30:42.811 --> 01:30:43.860
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason it grew.</v>

1933
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:45.743
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty nuts when you think about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because every other animal on this </v>

1934
01:30:47.941 --> 01:30:48.774
<v Speaker 2>fucking planet is basically like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some advanced animals like </v>

1935
01:30:53.251 --> 01:30:57.300
<v Speaker 2>chimps and dolphins and some other </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced animals,</v>

<v Speaker 2>how their little brains work.</v>

1938
01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:06.690

<v Speaker 2>shit that we can do to the planet,</v>

1939
01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:11.340

<v Speaker 2>level than everything that exists in </v>

1945
01:31:29.161 --> 01:31:33.240
<v Speaker 2>terms of if maybe not far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not our actual overall intelligence,</v>

1946
01:31:33.241 --> 01:31:36.960
<v Speaker 2>our ability to change our environment.</v>

<v Speaker 1>leg up.</v>

2005
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:19.920
<v Speaker 1>When you pick that leg up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy of that leg on your own time,</v>

2006

<v Speaker 1>games to just kill motherfuckers.</v>

2025
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.903
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand me in the seventh </v>
<v Speaker 1>inning when you're getting momentum in </v>

2026
01:35:21.921 --> 01:35:22.754
<v Speaker 1>comes this guy that throws one on fourth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's going to throw it's nine </v>

2027
01:35:28.761 --> 01:35:29.330
<v Speaker 1>pitches.</v>

2028
01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:31.810
<v Speaker 1>He's going to throw 12 pitches and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out of there.</v>

2029
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:35.660
<v Speaker 1>I really don't because remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the faster the ball comes in,</v>

2030
01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:38.510
<v Speaker 1>the faster the ball goes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always remember that too.</v>

2031
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.700
<v Speaker 1>If you live by the sword,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you die by that motherfucking sort of.</v>

2032
01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:43.573
<v Speaker 1>Somebody hits a home run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because he popped the 98 </v>

2033
01:35:46.970 --> 01:35:50.750
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker that made a mistake and put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in who?</v>

2034
01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Loeb and his gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's all it determined.</v>

2035
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:56.060
<v Speaker 1>It's just A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a game of inches.</v>

2036
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:57.223
<v Speaker 1>He just dropped it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just dropped a little bit too much </v>

2037
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:03.140
<v Speaker 1>for one of these fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now on the other side,</v>

2038
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:08.350
<v Speaker 1>you got to Marinovich that comes in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes that guy that batch to 90,</v>

2041
01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Because the recovery in that game is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole game,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking along those guys.</v>

2044
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Two or three years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's too much on that.</v>

2045
01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:26.353

<v Speaker 1>try this on your own and I had no </v>

2048
01:36:37.581 --> 01:36:38.414
<v Speaker 1>flexibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to go at least all the way the </v>

2049
01:36:41.961 --> 01:36:46.490
<v Speaker 1>fuck back this and as that leg drops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what that arm it has to come in.</v>

2050
01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

2051
01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.113
<v Speaker 1>Over the top and then down across and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now the follow through is the most </v>

2052
01:36:53.781 --> 01:36:54.614
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2053
01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:55.633
<v Speaker 1>it's got to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a thing for if you throw a </v>

2054
01:36:57.951 --> 01:36:58.784
<v Speaker 1>ball like a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean like a girl knows how </v>

2055
01:37:00.501 --> 01:37:02.480
<v Speaker 1>to throw a ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm talking about.</v>

2056
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:05.870
<v Speaker 1>If you throw a ball and spastic like as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Seagal.</v>

2057
01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will never respect you.</v>

2058
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:12.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a real issue like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could suck it a lot of stuff.</v>

2059
01:37:12.651 --> 01:37:14.600
<v Speaker 1>You could suck at basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about this?</v>

2060
01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:18.950
<v Speaker 1>You could suck at like throwing a free t</v>
<v Speaker 1>three a free throw and people laugh.</v>

2061
01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Ha ha ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you throw the first pitch and you</v>

2062
01:37:23.811 --> 01:37:26.720
<v Speaker 1>throw that like some uncoordinated </v>
<v Speaker 1>spazz,</v>

2063
01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:27.763
<v Speaker 1>if you hit this fucking first pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark it off the ground like you're a </v>

2064
01:37:31.401 --> 01:37:32.840
<v Speaker 1>loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a.</v>

2065
01:37:32.841 --> 01:37:35.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a harshness like people get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like some school yard shit</v>

2066
01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:39.660
<v Speaker 4>you just said free throat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You reminded me of something I saw.</v>

2067
01:37:39.661 --> 01:37:41.160
<v Speaker 4>I haven't heard anybody bring this up </v>
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>

2068
01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:44.580
<v Speaker 4>Someone made stevie wonder shoot a free </v>
<v Speaker 4>throw and they have it on video.</v>

2069
01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:45.680
<v Speaker 4>Did he nail it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2070
01:37:45.690 --> 01:37:47.580
<v Speaker 4>He missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well obviously terribly,</v>

2071
01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:51.420
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know how this movie and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to let him know he missed it.</v>

2072
01:37:51.421 --> 01:37:53.940
<v Speaker 4>They could have all just played along </v>
<v Speaker 4>and made it.</v>

2073
01:37:53.941 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 4>Someone should have caught it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other said dropped a ball</v>

2074
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:56.813
<v Speaker 3>right through the net.</v>

2075
01:38:01.210 --> 01:38:04.040
<v Speaker 3>They given another shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just says it over and over again.</v>

2076
01:38:04.041 --> 01:38:04.874
<v Speaker 3>But Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't they just let him figure it </v>

2077
01:38:06.981 --> 01:38:08.600
<v Speaker 3>out where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he keeps throwing it,</v>

2078
01:38:08.601 --> 01:38:10.880
<v Speaker 3>how long do you think it would take </v>
<v Speaker 3>before we figured out where it is?</v>

2079
01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:13.960
<v Speaker 3>A long he wouldn't even know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>install it.</v>

2080
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:16.450
<v Speaker 3>That's terrible that they even did this </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

2081
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:19.670
<v Speaker 3>If there was no one in the room and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could get,</v>

2082
01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:22.730
<v Speaker 3>let him use like echolocation what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>yelled out.</v>

2083
01:38:22.731 --> 01:38:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Hello with this beautiful voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hello.</v>

2084
01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:26.760
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2085
01:38:26.761 --> 01:38:27.594
<v Speaker 3>because deaf guys apparently are blind </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys rather apparently can do that to a </v>

2086
01:38:30.681 --> 01:38:33.650
<v Speaker 3>certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they hear sound bounce off things,</v>

2087
01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:34.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how far away things are.</v>

2088
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:36.763
<v Speaker 3>But how would he know where the net is </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you put my waist right in front of </v>

2089
01:38:40.731 --> 01:38:41.240
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go.</v>

2090
01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:43.150
<v Speaker 3>The thing is 15 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2091
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:44.840
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From us right now.</v>

2092
01:38:44.841 --> 01:38:45.674
<v Speaker 3>Stevie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be under them that you just keep </v>

2093
01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:49.100
<v Speaker 3>going into your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking hit it.</v>

2094
01:38:49.101 --> 01:38:49.934
<v Speaker 3>Success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the concept of 15 feet to a guy </v>

2095
01:38:52.671 --> 01:38:54.120
<v Speaker 3>who was blind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2096
01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he lost 10 feet in the air?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2097
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:59.120
<v Speaker 3>Ten feet in the air?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2098
01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.470
<v Speaker 3>that's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2099
01:39:00.471 --> 01:39:01.304
<v Speaker 3>I was going to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just never thrown anything before </v>

2100
01:39:03.351 --> 01:39:05.840
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not embarrassing.</v>

2101
01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:08.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially at Stevie wonder's blind.</v>

2102
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:09.223
<v Speaker 3>But if even if it was a regular guy that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sucked at basketball and through a free </v>

2103
01:39:12.051 --> 01:39:13.040
<v Speaker 3>throw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be funny.</v>

2104
01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Be Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But funny,</v>

2105
01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:17.420
<v Speaker 3>but if you fucking missed that first </v>
<v Speaker 3>pitch,</v>

2106
01:39:17.650 --> 01:39:19.610
<v Speaker 3>if they ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey joey,</v>

2107
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:20.623
<v Speaker 3>I hear you're going to be in town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to throw out the first pitch </v>

2108
01:39:22.101 --> 01:39:23.660
<v Speaker 3>for the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2109
01:39:23.661 --> 01:39:24.211
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2110
01:39:24.211 --> 01:39:24.810
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2111
01:39:24.810 --> 01:39:26.630
<v Speaker 3>I used to play a lot of baseball when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a kid.</v>

2112
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:29.060
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go out there.</v>

2113
01:39:29.061 --> 01:39:32.170
<v Speaker 3>I'll full of piss and vinegar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want.</v>

2114
01:39:32.210 --> 01:39:34.270
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't make 60 feet.</v>

2115
01:39:34.271 --> 01:39:35.810
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no way.</v>

2116
01:39:36.110 --> 01:39:36.943
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gary Dell bought day from the stern </v>

01:39:38.151 --> 01:39:38.721
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here.</v>

2118
01:39:38.721 --> 01:39:39.870
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way.</v>

2119
01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:42.920
<v Speaker 3>I would make 60 feet right here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what he does.</v>

2120
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.903
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're good.</v>

2121
01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:45.800
<v Speaker 3>They're all talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's an event.</v>

2122
01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Maybe one of the worst ones ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>

2123
01:39:49.041 --> 01:39:49.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2124
01:39:49.471 --> 01:39:53.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He throws it and they don't show you.</v>

2125
01:39:53.091 --> 01:39:56.210
<v Speaker 3>They actually hear it goes throw it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2126
01:39:56.810 --> 01:39:58.010
<v Speaker 3>It didn't go anywhere near him.</v>

2127
01:40:02.050 --> 01:40:02.883
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He completely missed to make it any </v>

2128
01:40:05.290 --> 01:40:06.123
<v Speaker 3>worse than it is though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it went all the way to the </v>

2129
01:40:07.211 --> 01:40:09.050
<v Speaker 3>catcher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2130
01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:15.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2131
01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:18.360
<v Speaker 3>You should get made fun of him for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd been making fun of him.</v>

2132
01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:20.080
<v Speaker 3>That's why there's a whole piece about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2133
01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:21.213
<v Speaker 3>but do you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said this is what happens when you </v>

2134
01:40:23.081 --> 01:40:25.250
<v Speaker 3>get made fun of this is what happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you throw like that.</v>

2135
01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:27.311
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2136
01:40:27.311 --> 01:40:28.260
<v Speaker 3>You get made fun of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2137
01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:32.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were saying that he missed</v>

2138
01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:33.183
<v Speaker 3>because he gets made fun of like they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroyed his confidence to the point </v>

2139
01:40:35.621 --> 01:40:38.440
<v Speaker 3>where you can't throw a baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

2140
01:40:39.630 --> 01:40:42.130
<v Speaker 3>It's a good point though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about throwing.</v>

2141
01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:42.551
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

2142
01:40:42.551 --> 01:40:44.800
<v Speaker 3>they have the worst first pitches ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2143
01:40:44.801 --> 01:40:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Ip in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be in that for sure.</v>

2144
01:40:46.961 --> 01:40:47.794
<v Speaker 3>I can't really throw the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried Puma football a couple months </v>

2145

2148
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:54.160

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:04.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they're not hurting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing in there.</v>

2152
01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you get an Mri?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Can you put your arms over your head?</v>

<v Speaker 1>bat the way that bats are great.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Simple shit for a fat dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

01:42:05.170 --> 01:42:06.003
<v Speaker 1>they teach that old manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's just less movement and get the </v>

2178
01:42:09.701 --> 01:42:11.950
<v Speaker 1>job done effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great dude,</v>

2179
01:42:12.010 --> 01:42:14.160
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we worked in off of a.</v>

2180
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:15.310
<v Speaker 1>At first he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2181
01:42:15.330 --> 01:42:16.163
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna have a problem with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get a Kettlebell and working off </v>

2182
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:22.330
<v Speaker 1>of a Turkish got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be a lot easier for you to develop</v>

2183
01:42:22.331 --> 01:42:23.680
<v Speaker 1>the movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was basically,</v>

2184
01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:25.420
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the under hook,</v>

2185
01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:27.580
<v Speaker 1>grab the arm and just flip over that.</v>

2186
01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:30.240
<v Speaker 1>But he turns it very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2187
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:32.560
<v Speaker 1>he's a good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you do Turkish getups,</v>

2188
01:42:32.561 --> 01:42:33.394
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't bother your shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do a Turkish get up to the </v>

2189
01:42:36.191 --> 01:42:37.080
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for,</v>

2190
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I can't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do point.</v>

2191
01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:43.630
<v Speaker 1>You can't get to the fifth part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom here to the top.</v>

2192
01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't ever stand up all the way?</v>

2193
01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:48.281
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2194
01:42:48.281 --> 01:42:48.791
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2195
01:42:48.791 --> 01:42:52.150
<v Speaker 1>So you just hip up and you have the from</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hip.</v>

2196
01:42:52.151 --> 01:42:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I do more my hands to be honest with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2197
01:42:54.430 --> 01:42:56.200
<v Speaker 1>The shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

2198
01:42:56.201 --> 01:42:58.690
<v Speaker 1>that little weighted bat is tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it.</v>

2199
01:42:58.691 --> 01:42:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it.</v>

2200
01:42:59.810 --> 01:43:00.643
<v Speaker 1>I'm the reason why you don't get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because of the weight or your </v>

2201
01:43:02.891 --> 01:43:04.720
<v Speaker 1>shoulders?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my weight and the weight.</v>

2202
01:43:04.721 --> 01:43:06.490
<v Speaker 1>It's the weight on the shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 1>combined.</v>

2203
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2204
01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:07.970
<v Speaker 1>you can do the model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2205
01:43:07.971 --> 01:43:08.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2206
01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I can do the leg thing and go from </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2207
01:43:11.370 --> 01:43:11.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2208
01:43:11.710 --> 01:43:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm good that that's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is with the,</v>

2209
01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:19.570
<v Speaker 1>especially with the Turkish get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people underestimate the benefit of</v>

2210
01:43:19.571 --> 01:43:20.404
<v Speaker 1>doing it with even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait like you just doing it as a </v>

2211
01:43:22.421 --> 01:43:24.340
<v Speaker 1>posture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just lying on your back,</v>

2212
01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:27.070
<v Speaker 1>straighten your arm up and going through</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the motions,</v>

2213
01:43:27.071 --> 01:43:28.900
<v Speaker 1>propping up on your elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2214
01:43:28.930 --> 01:43:30.490
<v Speaker 1>going up on the hip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2215
01:43:30.530 --> 01:43:32.500
<v Speaker 1>hoisting your hip hop lyft net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one leg,</v>

2216
01:43:32.501 --> 01:43:33.334
<v Speaker 1>getting an underneath you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up straight and then fully </v>

2217
01:43:36.071 --> 01:43:37.600
<v Speaker 1>standing straight with your arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>extended.</v>

2218
01:43:37.630 --> 01:43:41.710
<v Speaker 1>If you just go through that series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motions have been carrying a Kettlebell.</v>

2219
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.780
<v Speaker 1>That's an professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alvarado is Walmart.</v>

2220
01:43:43.810 --> 01:43:44.950
<v Speaker 1>He does that with no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2221
01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:45.813
<v Speaker 1>no Kettlebell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2222
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.370
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that as a warmup.</v>

2223
01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean people don't it if you don't</v>

2224
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:55.640
<v Speaker 2>move your body around a lot like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to move your body around like,</v>

2225
01:43:55.670 --> 01:43:57.800
<v Speaker 2>you know what I started doing recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I haven't done it forever.</v>

2226
01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Jumping rope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started jumping.</v>

2227
01:44:00.710 --> 01:44:03.380
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to.</v>

2228
01:44:03.381 --> 01:44:04.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to.</v>

2229
01:44:04.890 --> 01:44:05.723
<v Speaker 2>Minutes is 20 minutes of jogging to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to do three minutes like </v>

2230
01:44:09.490 --> 01:44:14.210
<v Speaker 2>around like in between like a set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the boxing timer and I do three minutes.</v>

2231
01:44:14.211 --> 01:44:15.690
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

2232
01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:17.433
<v Speaker 2>You're like this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He feel pretty good and then about 30 </v>

2233
01:44:20.151 --> 01:44:21.710
<v Speaker 2>seconds and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2234
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I gotta fucking concentrated here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to make this.</v>

2235
01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:28.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling it in my feet started </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurting.</v>

2236
01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:29.361
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2237
01:44:29.361 --> 01:44:31.250
<v Speaker 2>this is one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't do it,</v>

2238
01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:32.870
<v Speaker 2>you think it's easy and then once you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2239
01:44:32.871 --> 01:44:34.700
<v Speaker 2>you realize are you going to get in </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape for this too?</v>

2240
01:44:34.701 --> 01:44:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Like everything else.</v>

2241
01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Your body's not used to jumping around </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that point and going,</v>

2242
01:44:38.210 --> 01:44:38.680
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

2243
01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:39.131
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

2244
01:44:39.131 --> 01:44:39.611
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

2245
01:44:39.611 --> 01:44:40.251
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

2246
01:44:40.251 --> 01:44:40.701
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

2247
01:44:40.701 --> 01:44:42.710
<v Speaker 2>don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you can do it,</v>

2248
01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:44.053
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine there'll be tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>for your footwork and you free your </v>

2249
01:44:46.071 --> 01:44:49.520
<v Speaker 2>agility and your foot strength and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the strength in,</v>

2250
01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:52.400
<v Speaker 2>in all those connecting ligaments </v>
<v Speaker 2>because essentially what you're doing is</v>

2251
01:44:52.401 --> 01:44:54.940
<v Speaker 2>little tiny plyometrics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2252
01:44:54.941 --> 01:44:56.330
<v Speaker 2>you're jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

2253
01:44:56.331 --> 01:44:59.210
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting full extended </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosion movements,</v>

2254
01:44:59.211 --> 01:45:02.120
<v Speaker 2>but you're getting these little jumping </v>
<v Speaker 2>bounces where you know,</v>

2255
01:45:02.121 --> 01:45:03.170
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're with me.</v>

2256
01:45:03.171 --> 01:45:06.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm 196 or something like that and 196 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds going,</v>

2257
01:45:06.781 --> 01:45:07.361
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

2258
01:45:07.361 --> 01:45:08.510
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on my feet.</v>

2259
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:10.580
<v Speaker 2>That's great for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2260
01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:11.713
<v Speaker 2>it develops real strength in your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got sore in weird places for like </v>

2261
01:45:16.791 --> 01:45:19.240
<v Speaker 2>three weeks when I first started putting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to rankle yeah,</v>

2262
01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:21.890
<v Speaker 2>my ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My calves got super tight,</v>

2263
01:45:21.891 --> 01:45:22.724
<v Speaker 2>like it was really fucking up my </v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing because I would try to kick </v>

2264
01:45:25.730 --> 01:45:28.700
<v Speaker 2>and I'd be worried that like my calf was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to lock up.</v>

2265
01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Like it was real sore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a in a,</v>

2266
01:45:31.611 --> 01:45:32.470
<v Speaker 2>in a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2267
01:45:32.471 --> 01:45:36.350
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was hitting with those Hindu</v>
<v Speaker 2>squats and I like to do.</v>

2268
01:45:36.351 --> 01:45:38.120
<v Speaker 2>I think I thought that was hitting my </v>
<v Speaker 2>calves and up.</v>

2269
01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:39.013
<v Speaker 2>I guess not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no substitution for that little </v>

2270
01:45:40.971 --> 01:45:43.970
<v Speaker 2>bouncing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know where I got it from him,</v>

2271
01:45:44.810 --> 01:45:45.643
<v Speaker 2>Lance Armstrong's podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to Lance Armstrong's </v>

2272
01:45:48.291 --> 01:45:51.950
<v Speaker 2>podcast and he was talking about his son</v>
<v Speaker 2>being friends with.</v>

2273
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:56.450
<v Speaker 2>He's friends with Brett farve and Brett </v>
<v Speaker 2>farve came to his house in the son plays</v>

2274
01:45:56.451 --> 01:45:57.620
<v Speaker 2>football,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he asked his son,</v>

2275
01:45:57.621 --> 01:45:58.454
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2276
01:45:58.490 --> 01:46:00.830
<v Speaker 2>do you skip rope?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is the first thing he asked,</v>

2277
01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:05.480
<v Speaker 2>and he had talked to some other guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was also some big time football player,</v>

2278
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:07.370
<v Speaker 2>big time football coach rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>

2279
01:46:07.371 --> 01:46:09.500
<v Speaker 2>do skip rope and the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2280
01:46:09.501 --> 01:46:10.334
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you got to skip rope and the same </v>

2281
01:46:11.781 --> 01:46:13.580
<v Speaker 2>thing Brett Farve said you got to skip </v>
<v Speaker 2>rope.</v>

2282
01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:14.653
<v Speaker 2>Like there's something about jumping </v>
<v Speaker 2>rope that for like footwork and </v>

2283
01:46:17.541 --> 01:46:19.040
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I said,</v>

2284
01:46:19.041 --> 01:46:19.874
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start doing that and right </v>

2285
01:46:20.931 --> 01:46:21.764
<v Speaker 2>away I realized like God damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come I haven't been doing this </v>

2286
01:46:23.841 --> 01:46:25.790
<v Speaker 2>forever?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have been doing this forever.</v>

2287
01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:27.073
<v Speaker 2>Open everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got one of those everlast while my </v>

2288
01:46:29.481 --> 01:46:30.314
<v Speaker 2>daughter go and do a layer on top ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she left it out there one day and I </v>

2289
01:46:33.090 --> 01:46:34.670
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me try this old school.</v>

2290
01:46:35.330 --> 01:46:38.960
<v Speaker 2>I do like 32 seconds at those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you rip your feet apart?</v>

2291
01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:39.913
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing that I got those cube </v>

2292
01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:46.570
<v Speaker 2>does it have for going feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll fuck around Jack.</v>

2293
01:46:47.630 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 2>This was coming up when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody</v>

2294
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:50.843
<v Speaker 1>you talked to tell you how to jump rope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to jump rope at night with no </v>

2295
01:46:53.341 --> 01:46:54.174
<v Speaker 1>weights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basketball workout was 20 slash 30 </v>

2296
01:46:56.881 --> 01:46:58.980
<v Speaker 1>minutes of jumping rope and then I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit on the wall,</v>

2297
01:46:59.790 --> 01:47:02.340
<v Speaker 1>just sit to condition my thighs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty,</v>

2298
01:47:02.341 --> 01:47:03.510
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

2299
01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wall sit thing.</v>

2300
01:47:05.540 --> 01:47:08.730
<v Speaker 1>That was always big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Karate schools was a big wolf.</v>

2301
01:47:08.731 --> 01:47:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Say the spine to the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had a wall looking straight ahead.</v>

2302
01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:13.260
<v Speaker 1>If you could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2303
01:47:13.290 --> 01:47:15.030
<v Speaker 1>you a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then they did horses.</v>

2304
01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:16.793
<v Speaker 1>Horses in class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always motherfuckers that would sit </v>

2305
01:47:19.531 --> 01:47:21.290
<v Speaker 1>there and go 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2306
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably better to run </v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs.</v>

2307
01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the run stairs.</v>

2308
01:47:28.710 --> 01:47:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Are you really running them to know I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have hills near my house,</v>

2309
01:47:33.091 --> 01:47:34.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hills near my house.</v>

2310
01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I do some sprints up those on occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fairly rare.</v>

2311
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:40.103
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I like about that though </v>

2312
01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:45.960
<v Speaker 1>is that it's like you're exploding your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body forward.</v>

2313
01:47:45.961 --> 01:47:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I think like that static hold of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's benefits to that for sure,</v>

2314
01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:52.770
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't think he can fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 1>plyometrics.</v>

2315
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:53.803
<v Speaker 1>Essentially what you're running a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially dealing like one </v>

2316
01:47:55.561 --> 01:47:58.140
<v Speaker 1>legged plyometrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just exploding,</v>

2317
01:47:58.141 --> 01:48:00.900
<v Speaker 1>exploding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploding for the workout that you do.</v>

2318
01:48:00.901 --> 01:48:01.734
<v Speaker 1>When the Diet you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that you have to recommend </v>

2319
01:48:03.451 --> 01:48:06.510
<v Speaker 1>running once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sprints that primal diet,</v>

2320
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:10.110
<v Speaker 1>they say absolutely like 10:40</v>
<v Speaker 1>yard sprints.</v>

2321
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:11.870
<v Speaker 1>It's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a 40 year,</v>

2322
01:48:11.871 --> 01:48:14.550
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just need a heart attack at this point</v>

2323
01:48:14.551 --> 01:48:15.270
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>

2324
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:17.300
<v Speaker 1>For Awhile I was going crazy when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't find that.</v>

2325
01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out the cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wasn't breathing?</v>

2326
01:48:19.231 --> 01:48:21.240
<v Speaker 1>I would go into that fucking north </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood park,</v>

2327
01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:24.880
<v Speaker 1>walk around with a farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was kettle bell and then I would like</v>

2328
01:48:24.930 --> 01:48:25.763
<v Speaker 1>do 10 sets of swings and they'll go let </v>
<v Speaker 1>me try some fucking sprints and that </v>

2329
01:48:29.041 --> 01:48:30.520
<v Speaker 1>would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not realizing like,</v>

2330
01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:31.373
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could pull something here that can </v>

2331
01:48:34.561 --> 01:48:37.260
<v Speaker 1>then retain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't just a fucking,</v>

2332
01:48:37.261 --> 01:48:38.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

2333
01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:40.710
<v Speaker 1>you're not warmed up properly for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2334
01:48:40.770 --> 01:48:41.603
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember going to track as a kid </v>

2335
01:48:43.051 --> 01:48:43.884
<v Speaker 1>because they tried to tell me during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>off season basketball players with a </v>

2336
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:47.833
<v Speaker 1>high jump to stay in shape and we had </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy real wolf and I read wolf was </v>

2337
01:48:51.901 --> 01:48:53.580
<v Speaker 1>the one of the assistants at the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympics.</v>

2338
01:48:53.581 --> 01:48:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Great Guy and you know he was at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bend squats.</v>

2339
01:48:57.330 --> 01:49:00.180
<v Speaker 1>That was this big fucking squats to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck.</v>

2340
01:49:00.190 --> 01:49:01.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go down on the squad and popping </v>

2341
01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:06.880
<v Speaker 1>into jumping rope and those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>spreads.</v>

2342
01:49:06.890 --> 01:49:09.710
<v Speaker 1>And we used to run hills in north Bergen</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the second hill.</v>

2343
01:49:09.711 --> 01:49:11.820
<v Speaker 1>He is fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2344
01:49:11.970 --> 01:49:13.840
<v Speaker 1>that's a nightmare type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

2345
01:49:13.850 --> 01:49:16.140
<v Speaker 1>No running hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard,</v>

2346
01:49:16.141 --> 01:49:17.340
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the hardest shit.</v>

2347
01:49:17.670 --> 01:49:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Running sand dunes run in sand dunes is </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark death.</v>

2348
01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:23.513
<v Speaker 1>That's you just legs have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going through that sand and </v>

2349
01:49:26.671 --> 01:49:30.110
<v Speaker 1>you're barely making progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listened my fight with Shane car.</v>

2350
01:49:30.111 --> 01:49:32.880
<v Speaker 1>We've got canceled because I don't need </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking dudes.</v>

2351
01:49:32.881 --> 01:49:34.330
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's Shane Shankar?</v>

2352
01:49:34.331 --> 01:49:35.350

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2354
01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:38.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't take it no more on the </v>

2355
01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:41.850
<v Speaker 1>silence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2356
01:49:41.851 --> 01:49:42.684
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he wants to have some fun while </v>

2357
01:49:44.641 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 1>he's still Shankar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I salute that he could still hit</v>

2358
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:50.170
<v Speaker 3>hard in a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that?</v>

2359
01:49:50.171 --> 01:49:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Jason knows fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see what crazy Jason Ellis did?</v>

2360
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:54.663
<v Speaker 3>Jason Ellis fought Shane Carwyn with one</v>
<v Speaker 3>hand tied up or Shane Karlyn had his </v>

2361
01:49:58.211 --> 01:50:01.040
<v Speaker 3>right hand tied up to his body and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jason,</v>

2362
01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:02.880
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't realize how big Shane car is.</v>

2363
01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:05.200
<v Speaker 3>Like Jason knows is not the tiniest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

2364
01:50:05.201 --> 01:50:06.034
<v Speaker 3>He's probably about 200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is standing next to Shankar when it </v>

2365
01:50:08.951 --> 01:50:11.140
<v Speaker 3>is almost comical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How will you this?</v>

2366
01:50:11.290 --> 01:50:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Look how big car one is.</v>

2367
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:16.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a giant.</v>

2368
01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:19.000
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking giant and he's got one </v>
<v Speaker 3>arm tied up.</v>

2369
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.863
<v Speaker 3>Look at this and he looks good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like physically he looks jacked like he </v>

2370
01:50:24.701 --> 01:50:27.250
<v Speaker 3>hasn't fought in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but obviously he's been working out.</v>

2371
01:50:27.670 --> 01:50:30.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean he looks better than he did the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did the last time I saw him.</v>

2372
01:50:31.110 --> 01:50:34.450
<v Speaker 3>The last time I saw him he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>recovering from some injuries and he was</v>

2373
01:50:34.451 --> 01:50:35.284
<v Speaker 3>still in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So apparently he's a free agent and I </v>

2374
01:50:40.481 --> 01:50:41.620
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2375
01:50:41.621 --> 01:50:42.454
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's fighting for rise and I'm pretty </v>

2376
01:50:44.201 --> 01:50:44.921
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2377
01:50:44.921 --> 01:50:47.620
<v Speaker 3>I know we put it on his instagram page,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that was one.</v>

2380
01:50:56.010 --> 01:50:59.690
<v Speaker 3>That was one punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he hit him with that wasn't even the</v>

2381
01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:01.530
<v Speaker 3>punch that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that chaos is it?</v>

2382
01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:05.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2383
01:51:05.740 --> 01:51:07.960
<v Speaker 3>that was like at the end of a round I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

2384
01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:11.230
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where it came from right here.</v>

2385
01:51:13.890 --> 01:51:17.550
<v Speaker 3>So that was the second one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that one really came,</v>

2386
01:51:17.610 --> 01:51:18.443
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could see when he was down he was </v>

2387

<v Speaker 3>I mean that guy is so goddamn big </v>
<v Speaker 3>Carlin's as gigantic human.</v>

2389
01:51:26.170 --> 01:51:28.420
<v Speaker 3>So they were talking about setting him </v>
<v Speaker 3>up with fader,</v>

2390
01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:31.480
<v Speaker 3>like fate or versus car one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's gonna happen,</v>

2391
01:51:31.481 --> 01:51:32.830
<v Speaker 3>but if that does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in,</v>

2392
01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm paying to see that.</v>

2393
01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:40.850
<v Speaker 3>That's a dangerous fight for fader now </v>
<v Speaker 3>was writing for a dangerous Pfizer.</v>

2394
01:51:41.050 --> 01:51:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2395
01:51:42.010 --> 01:51:46.120
<v Speaker 3>So essentially the same guy who is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>charge of a pride for awhile.</v>

2396
01:51:47.490 --> 01:51:49.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2397
01:51:49.001 --> 01:51:51.010
<v Speaker 3>I believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2398
01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:52.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he goes over and fights,</v>

2399
01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:57.340
<v Speaker 3>if Karlyn goes over and fights in Japan </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he fights fade or as a giant fight,</v>

2400
01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:00.373
<v Speaker 3>afraid offered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought fabio Maldonado and barely </v>

2401
01:52:02.591 --> 01:52:03.424
<v Speaker 3>squeaked by a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people thought that he should </v>

2402
01:52:05.531 --> 01:52:06.610
<v Speaker 3>have lost you got hurt.</v>

2403
01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:10.390
<v Speaker 3>Fabio Maldonado tagged them in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no shame in that.</v>

2404
01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Fabio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fabio Maldonado is a very good boxer.</v>

2405
01:52:14.170 --> 01:52:17.050
<v Speaker 3>He rocked glover to Sherra before glover</v>
<v Speaker 3>finished him off.</v>

2406
01:52:17.590 --> 01:52:18.220
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2407
01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:19.720
<v Speaker 3>it was just tough shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a tough,</v>

2408
01:52:19.721 --> 01:52:20.554
<v Speaker 3>tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always call that poor guy in like </v>

2409
01:52:22.811 --> 01:52:26.390
<v Speaker 3>they always Fabio's life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are we going to get fired?</v>

2410
01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:28.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who will be this fucking wacky to fight?</v>

2411
01:52:28.610 --> 01:52:30.430
<v Speaker 3>I should know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fabio.</v>

2412
01:52:30.431 --> 01:52:31.264
<v Speaker 3>Mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you remember how he saved that fight </v>

2413
01:52:32.741 --> 01:52:36.700
<v Speaker 3>in Australia somewhere in Brazil some </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2414
01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:37.873
<v Speaker 3>Steve Bay and heavyweight steep emile </v>
<v Speaker 3>chick when Steve Bay's just fucking </v>

2415
01:52:41.321 --> 01:52:42.570
<v Speaker 3>tearing through the ranks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2416
01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:46.640
<v Speaker 3>Steve Bay's trying to get a shot at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>title and he fights Fabio Maldonado.</v>

2417
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:48.320
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2418
01:52:48.321 --> 01:52:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Steve Ages ran through them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was horrific.</v>

2419
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:52.850
<v Speaker 3>And Steve Bay's a scary guy as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight.</v>

2420
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:56.270
<v Speaker 3>And Fabio Maldonado just was not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same size,</v>

2421
01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:58.400
<v Speaker 3>just did not belong in there with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2422
01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:01.790
<v Speaker 3>just too big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too strong,</v>

2423
01:53:01.791 --> 01:53:02.480
<v Speaker 3>too fast.</v>

2424
01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:04.160
<v Speaker 3>It's too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so scary fight.</v>

2425
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:05.803
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think about Fabio Rockin fader </v>

2426
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:13.060
<v Speaker 3>and hurting him in his last fight and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think good lord would,</v>

2427
01:53:13.061 --> 01:53:13.894
<v Speaker 3>if he gets hit by a car when like car </v>
<v Speaker 3>car when takes a great shot and he hits </v>

2428
01:53:18.231 --> 01:53:19.920
<v Speaker 3>harder than anybody in the division.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2429
01:53:19.921 --> 01:53:20.754
<v Speaker 3>he's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably one of the scariest </v>

2430
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:28.990
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight punchers ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally ever when he fought mere,</v>

2431
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:33.700
<v Speaker 3>I remember he tied near up in a clench </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just ripped up or cuts to his chin,</v>

2432
01:53:33.710 --> 01:53:36.710
<v Speaker 3>his face and put them down and just beat</v>
<v Speaker 3>them down when you're on the ground.</v>

2433
01:53:36.711 --> 01:53:41.711
<v Speaker 3>Like car could fuck in Ponch scary </v>
<v Speaker 3>puncher man.</v>

2434
01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:45.410
<v Speaker 3>So if he's healthy like he looks like </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that video,</v>

2435
01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:47.900
<v Speaker 3>it looks fucking healthy to me and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks huge.</v>

2436
01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:50.180
<v Speaker 3>It looks like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well over to 60.</v>

2437
01:53:51.230 --> 01:53:52.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if fader,</v>

2438
01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:56.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's the kind of fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to stage of his life,</v>

2439
01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:57.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after he fought Maldonado,</v>

2440
01:53:58.490 --> 01:54:00.380
<v Speaker 3>he might be looking to fight smaller </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavyweights.</v>

2441
01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:02.390
<v Speaker 3>He might be looking to fight bigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>names,</v>

2442
01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:06.290
<v Speaker 3>will actually Carmen's pretty God damned</v>
<v Speaker 3>big name as far as the free market.</v>

2443
01:54:07.610 --> 01:54:09.080
<v Speaker 3>But who knows what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2444
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:11.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with um,</v>

2445
01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:14.060
<v Speaker 3>one of the crazy things with all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>new organizations,</v>

2446
01:54:14.061 --> 01:54:16.750
<v Speaker 3>whether it's one FC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's uh,</v>

2447
01:54:16.770 --> 01:54:19.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blank Bella tour,</v>

2448
01:54:19.690 --> 01:54:20.523
<v Speaker 3>rise in all these other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everyone is scrambling to pick up </v>

2449
01:54:24.051 --> 01:54:27.650
<v Speaker 3>anybody who leaves the UFC so of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's contracts are up.</v>

2450
01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:28.673
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're starting to do and they start </v>

2451
01:54:29.811 --> 01:54:32.750
<v Speaker 3>bolting over and go into these other </v>
<v Speaker 3>different organizations.</v>

2452
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:33.763
<v Speaker 3>Stuff can get crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like things can heat up and you might </v>

2453
01:54:36.141 --> 01:54:39.020
<v Speaker 3>see like another pride ufc type of </v>
<v Speaker 3>rivalry,</v>

2454
01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:40.970
<v Speaker 3>which I think would be great for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

2455
01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:42.163
<v Speaker 3>Like if rise and really does take off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if rise inputs on fate or versus </v>

2456
01:54:45.441 --> 01:54:46.274
<v Speaker 3>shame Darwin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they come up with a bunch of </v>

2457
01:54:48.141 --> 01:54:50.920
<v Speaker 3>other crazy fights for the undercard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2458
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:53.323
<v Speaker 3>just there's just not right now the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>level of talent available outside the </v>

2459
01:54:57.411 --> 01:54:59.270
<v Speaker 3>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not right now,</v>

2460
01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:00.673
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been close a few times and it used </v>

2461
01:55:02.931 --> 01:55:03.890
<v Speaker 3>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2462
01:55:03.891 --> 01:55:05.600
<v Speaker 3>obviously it used to be with pride.</v>

2463
01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:09.940
<v Speaker 3>It's hard making something like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>

2464
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:10.833
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel with like a Shane Carbon for </v>

2465
01:55:12.261 --> 01:55:14.600
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shannon Cullen was a great father.</v>

2466
01:55:14.601 --> 01:55:16.460
<v Speaker 3>He hasn't been thrown a punch in how </v>
<v Speaker 3>many years?</v>

2467
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:21.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't fought MMA since.</v>

2468
01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:24.410
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it's two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

2469
01:55:24.411 --> 01:55:27.470
<v Speaker 3>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The in my world,</v>

2470
01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:28.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2471
01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:32.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the professional here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think the UFC marketing would know</v>

2472
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:35.960
<v Speaker 3>they could do something with Shane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They passed on them.</v>

2473
01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's something they could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The heavyweight division is packed.</v>

2474
01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the parameters of this.</v>

2475
01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:42.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2476
01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:44.150
<v Speaker 3>I like when a fighter hasn't</v>

2477
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.920
<v Speaker 1>fought more than a year or two or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>even three.</v>

2478
01:55:48.450 --> 01:55:49.283
<v Speaker 1>I think about comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan and I think about if I just </v>

2479
01:55:51.781 --> 01:55:55.970
<v Speaker 1>didn't do any here for three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would I be ready for?</v>

2480
01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:56.993
<v Speaker 1>What would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't do any comedy for three </v>

2481
01:55:58.351 --> 01:55:59.184
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you honestly booked yourself </v>

2482
01:56:00.451 --> 01:56:02.460
<v Speaker 1>for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And fucking December.</v>

2483
01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:04.260
<v Speaker 1>It's October 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

2484
01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:07.050
<v Speaker 1>what would you book yourself on December</v>
<v Speaker 1>the garden?</v>

2485
01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:09.973
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do like the laughing skull in </v>

2486
01:56:11.011 --> 01:56:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2487
01:56:13.410 --> 01:56:15.420
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cool intimate little room.</v>

2488
01:56:15.421 --> 01:56:16.254
<v Speaker 1>Very quiet and Cedar might not have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of money and the rise in might have </v>

2489
01:56:21.091 --> 01:56:24.300
<v Speaker 1>offered them a big channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand all these parameters,</v>

2490
01:56:24.301 --> 01:56:26.820
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying to you is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2491
01:56:26.850 --> 01:56:31.710
<v Speaker 1>it's like the GSP thing that was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on and maybe they weren't what they were</v>

2492
01:56:31.711 --> 01:56:34.710
<v Speaker 1>and I think even as a fighter to three </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

2493
01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:36.120
<v Speaker 1>shit is fucking changed.</v>

2494
01:56:36.530 --> 01:56:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes and no.</v>

2495
01:56:39.090 --> 01:56:39.923
<v Speaker 1>Here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2496
01:56:40.170 --> 01:56:41.003
<v Speaker 1>depends on if you're still training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you decide to take some time off </v>

2497
01:56:43.771 --> 01:56:46.200
<v Speaker 1>because you have nagging injuries or </v>
<v Speaker 1>some fighters like that.</v>

2498
01:56:46.201 --> 01:56:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Valtellina guy we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about earlier,</v>

2499
01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:51.030
<v Speaker 1>he stepped back because of concussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>syndrome because he was getting.</v>

2500
01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:51.601
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2501
01:56:51.601 --> 01:56:52.434
<v Speaker 1>he had too many hits to the head and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>he recognized it was having some real </v>

2502
01:56:55.351 --> 01:57:00.351
<v Speaker 1>symptoms and he said no after resigned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he gave up his belt and taking two or</v>

2503
01:57:02.071 --> 01:57:02.904
<v Speaker 1>three years off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're having any sort of real </v>

2504
01:57:04.231 --> 01:57:05.064
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you've got a reoccurring back </v>

2505
01:57:06.601 --> 01:57:08.580
<v Speaker 1>injury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I know Shane had some bad habits.</v>

2506
01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:10.130
<v Speaker 1>He had surgery for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2507
01:57:10.170 --> 01:57:14.070
<v Speaker 1>So maybe taking that time off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was junior dos Santos was his last</v>

2508
01:57:14.071 --> 01:57:17.250
<v Speaker 1>loss and that was UFC 1:31</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wow.</v>

2509
01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's five fucking years ago.</v>

2510
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Almost five and a half years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy's the heavyweight division,</v>

2511
01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:26.960
<v Speaker 1>has come and gone in five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>

2512
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:29.700
<v Speaker 1>People want to come back and now two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one slash 70.</v>

2513
01:57:30.130 --> 01:57:30.963
<v Speaker 1>One 70 has come and gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyrone Woodley is the champion and one </v>

2514
01:57:35.101 --> 01:57:35.934
<v Speaker 1>of the boy's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These kids weren't even around when GSP </v>

2515
01:57:38.671 --> 01:57:41.580
<v Speaker 1>fucking dropped off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our Tyrone Woodley was.</v>

2516
01:57:41.790 --> 01:57:42.623
<v Speaker 1>Well not Stephen Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a whole breath of fresh air </v>

2517
01:57:45.021 --> 01:57:45.854
<v Speaker 1>that comes into it is I think when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Bisping was pretty smart trying </v>

2518
01:57:50.401 --> 01:57:53.130
<v Speaker 1>to get GSP to fight him in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still at Man.</v>

2519
01:57:53.131 --> 01:57:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great one.</v>

2520
01:57:54.450 --> 01:57:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if George wants to fight at</v>
<v Speaker 1>one 85.</v>

2521
01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I think George has even said that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>could make 1:55,</v>

2522
01:57:59.910 --> 01:58:00.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between the size of guys </v>

2523
01:58:02.701 --> 01:58:03.534
<v Speaker 1>today versus the way they were then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no guys are way more sophisticated </v>

2524
01:58:07.951 --> 01:58:12.090
<v Speaker 1>about weight cutting and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>George lifts as much weights anymore.</v>

2525
01:58:12.150 --> 01:58:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's as big as it used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

2526
01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

2527
01:58:15.810 --> 01:58:16.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2528
01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:20.040
<v Speaker 1>If the guy wants to compete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game moves,</v>

2529
01:58:20.130 --> 01:58:24.000
<v Speaker 1>moves very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] has moved so much in two,</v>

2530
01:58:24.001 --> 01:58:25.940
<v Speaker 1>three years that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2531
01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:29.350
<v Speaker 1>they got a lot of these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching UFC eat.</v>

2532
01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:31.500
<v Speaker 1>They don't even really know who Shane </v>
<v Speaker 1>Koyczan one is.</v>

2533
01:58:31.710 --> 01:58:34.080
<v Speaker 1>We've got a whole new batch of audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's coming.</v>

2534
01:58:34.081 --> 01:58:36.900
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even with GSP,</v>

2535
01:58:36.901 --> 01:58:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of GSP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love to see him fighting it,</v>

2536
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:41.830
<v Speaker 1>but I had to ask myself questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was</v>

2537
01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:43.750
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to learn.</v>

2538
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:45.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like watching a fucking shark tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2539
01:58:45.881 --> 01:58:46.780
<v Speaker 3>You want to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2540
01:58:46.781 --> 01:58:47.614
<v Speaker 3>I think the UFC is argument as far as </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I had heard and this is all that </v>

2541
01:58:50.681 --> 01:58:52.060
<v Speaker 3>shit I read online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2542
01:58:52.090 --> 01:58:56.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't talk to the UFC interested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we read different dumb shit,</v>

2543
01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:57.393
<v Speaker 3>but they there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'd read online was that they were </v>

2544
01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:01.743
<v Speaker 3>not in agreement with how much money was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to cost to promote a fight with </v>

2545
01:59:04.601 --> 01:59:05.434
<v Speaker 3>them and that the people that watched </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight today that are fans of Ronda </v>

2546
01:59:07.601 --> 01:59:11.440
<v Speaker 3>Rousey and the fans Ican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conor mcgregor and all these current UFC</v>

2547
01:59:11.441 --> 01:59:14.290
<v Speaker 3>fighters that maybe these fans that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>only been fans for a couple of years,</v>

2548
01:59:14.291 --> 01:59:19.291
<v Speaker 3>they kind of forgot what I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>three years run the party,</v>

2549
01:59:20.231 --> 01:59:22.630
<v Speaker 3>but she don't think that it would take </v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

2550
01:59:23.050 --> 01:59:25.420
<v Speaker 3>one fucking promotional special.</v>

2551
01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:26.253
<v Speaker 3>One thing they do on Fox or people </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember just watch some of the fucking </v>

2552
01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:32.170
<v Speaker 3>epic fights with John Fitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Bj,</v>

2553
01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:33.700
<v Speaker 3>Bj Penn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2554
01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:37.390
<v Speaker 3>watch him submit Matt Hughes when Matt </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hughes at the top of the world,</v>

2555
01:59:37.391 --> 01:59:38.224
<v Speaker 3>watched him beat down Matt Serra after </v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt Serra stomped him and won the </v>

2556
01:59:40.871 --> 01:59:41.704
<v Speaker 3>title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You watch some of those fights and then </v>

2557
01:59:43.451 --> 01:59:45.430
<v Speaker 3>you hear him talk and see what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gentleman he is.</v>

2558
01:59:46.290 --> 01:59:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2559
01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:48.220
<v Speaker 3>Come on guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Golden.</v>

2560
01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:49.073
<v Speaker 3>I love him to Golden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the foreign names you mentioned </v>

2561
01:59:51.490 --> 01:59:53.230
<v Speaker 3>that fucking dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was.</v>

2562
01:59:53.550 --> 01:59:54.640
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2563
01:59:54.641 --> 01:59:57.910
<v Speaker 3>I think a guy like gsps to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got to do a tune up fight.</v>

2564
01:59:58.150 --> 02:00:02.110
<v Speaker 3>I really believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that would help everybody.</v>

2565
02:00:02.111 --> 02:00:04.030
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what you would do in </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing.</v>

2566
02:00:04.031 --> 02:00:08.710
<v Speaker 3>The only one that never did that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar ray Leonard went out of retirement</v>

2567
02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:12.520
<v Speaker 3>right to Marvin Hagler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh right,</v>

2568
02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:13.480
<v Speaker 3>right in there.</v>

2569
02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:16.300
<v Speaker 3>Just jumped right into Marvin fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>hagler and everybody was like,</v>

2570
02:00:16.301 --> 02:00:18.310
<v Speaker 3>you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need a tune up fight.</v>

2571
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:21.270
<v Speaker 3>And apparently he had some gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fine.</v>

2572
02:00:21.271 --> 02:00:22.104
<v Speaker 3>So they set up some smokers in the gym </v>
<v Speaker 3>just sorta like we were talking about </v>

2573
02:00:25.691 --> 02:00:28.400
<v Speaker 3>earlier that they do with the moisture </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he beat him.</v>

2574
02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:31.090
<v Speaker 3>Beat him by decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very controversial fight though.</v>

2575
02:00:31.450 --> 02:00:33.250
<v Speaker 3>Some people think that Marvin should </v>
<v Speaker 3>have one.</v>

2576
02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:37.420
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's probably one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights where it was almost 50 slash 50.</v>

2577
02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:40.360
<v Speaker 3>Most my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was at least amongst a lot of people.</v>

2578
02:00:40.361 --> 02:00:43.240
<v Speaker 3>I knew a lot of people thought that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marvin had did more damage.</v>

2579
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:45.730
<v Speaker 3>It landed the hardest shots with sugar I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was dealing with.</v>

2580
02:00:45.731 --> 02:00:48.610
<v Speaker 3>Just throw a pity pat punches and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't good enough.</v>

2581
02:00:48.611 --> 02:00:50.620
<v Speaker 3>And Marvin was chasing them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2582
02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:51.513
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to watch it again as an adult </v>

2583
02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:56.200
<v Speaker 3>who understands fighting better.</v>

2584
02:00:56.860 --> 02:00:57.693
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2585
02:00:57.880 --> 02:00:59.770
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't get destroyed.</v>

2586
02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:02.710
<v Speaker 3>And that's better than you could say for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that fought hagler.</v>

2587
02:01:03.190 --> 02:01:04.023
<v Speaker 3>Hagler was fucking Hagler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the haggar that crushed John the </v>

2588
02:01:06.521 --> 02:01:08.590
<v Speaker 3>beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mugabi remember that shit.</v>

2589
02:01:09.170 --> 02:01:12.340
<v Speaker 3>That's the Marvin Hagler that beat the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck out of Tommy hearns.</v>

2590
02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:16.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marvin Hagler was a monster when I was a</v>

2591
02:01:16.751 --> 02:01:17.584
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had this fucking TV show that they </v>

2592
02:01:19.961 --> 02:01:24.550
<v Speaker 3>showed were haggard was training for my </v>
<v Speaker 3>staff ham show and uh,</v>

2593
02:01:24.670 --> 02:01:27.790
<v Speaker 3>he was running on the beach in the Cape </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the winter.</v>

2594
02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:31.930
<v Speaker 3>He's running on the sand and Cape Cod </v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming war,</v>

2595
02:01:33.670 --> 02:01:34.990
<v Speaker 3>just running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming,</v>

2596
02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:38.240
<v Speaker 6>Wah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wah.</v>

2597
02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:43.760
<v Speaker 2>This who's just sure at shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2598
02:01:44.331 --> 02:01:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Marvin Hagler in his prime had one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best physiques ever for a boxer.</v>

2599
02:01:48.981 --> 02:01:49.814
<v Speaker 2>And he was in supreme condition and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was known for maybe not being like the </v>

2600
02:01:54.321 --> 02:01:55.154
<v Speaker 2>slickest most technical boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe sugar ray was or Roberto </v>

2601
02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:01.273
<v Speaker 2>Duran was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But overwhelming discipline and drive </v>

2602
02:02:04.041 --> 02:02:07.370
<v Speaker 2>and ferocity who will just break dudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

2603
02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:09.410
<v Speaker 2>you know like you did with the Tommy </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearns fight,</v>

2604
02:02:09.411 --> 02:02:12.290
<v Speaker 2>was the purest expression of Marvin </v>
<v Speaker 2>agler.</v>

2605
02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:13.393
<v Speaker 2>Just skimming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys are fighting for the fucking </v>

2606
02:02:14.620 --> 02:02:15.453
<v Speaker 2>middleweight championship of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a giant fight between two </v>

2607
02:02:17.571 --> 02:02:19.280
<v Speaker 2>superstars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do they do?</v>

2608
02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:24.520
<v Speaker 2>They just throw caution to the wind and </v>
<v Speaker 2>meet in the center of the ring and start</v>

2609
02:02:24.891 --> 02:02:28.160
<v Speaker 2>throwing bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no boxing in that fight.</v>

2610
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:31.490
<v Speaker 2>That was a war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a crazy war.</v>

2611
02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Throw that shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shut up.</v>

2612
02:02:33.261 --> 02:02:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Marvin hagler versus Tommy hearns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

2613
02:02:36.150 --> 02:02:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Because that was like talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put this motherfucker.</v>

2614
02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Just a massive risk taking endeavor to </v>
<v Speaker 2>step in there.</v>

2615
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Those two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as big as they were in their prime,</v>

2616
02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:50.750
<v Speaker 2>those dudes were gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty rough disco.</v>

2617
02:02:50.810 --> 02:02:53.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it was two rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you knocked him out in a second.</v>

2618
02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if at the most.</v>

2619
02:02:54.861 --> 02:02:55.694
<v Speaker 2>It was the third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty sure it's fuck is wrong </v>

2620
02:02:57.141 --> 02:02:57.980
<v Speaker 2>with Jamie.</v>

2621
02:02:58.850 --> 02:03:02.280
<v Speaker 3>Does your own bumps?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What were you looking for?</v>

2622
02:03:02.970 --> 02:03:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Trying to find which version of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight I was going to pull up.</v>

2623
02:03:05.401 --> 02:03:07.960
<v Speaker 3>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I started,</v>

2624
02:03:08.190 --> 02:03:09.023
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure he knocked him out in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the second round if I remember </v>

2625
02:03:10.651 --> 02:03:11.910
<v Speaker 3>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I might be wrong.</v>

2626
02:03:11.911 --> 02:03:12.770
<v Speaker 3>It might be the third,</v>

2627
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:17.670
<v Speaker 2>but either way it was just chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that I'm thinking about it,</v>

2628
02:03:17.671 --> 02:03:18.504
<v Speaker 2>thinking it was the third.</v>

2629
02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:22.513
<v Speaker 3>Tell us that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to look for that before I </v>

2630
02:03:23.931 --> 02:03:25.910
<v Speaker 3>pull up the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you got a video?</v>

2631
02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:29.720
<v Speaker 3>Just throw the video on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll figure it out when he gets knocked</v>

2632
02:03:29.721 --> 02:03:30.554
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean we had talked about Tommy </v>

2633
02:03:35.201 --> 02:03:37.930
<v Speaker 3>hearns the other day when Tommy hearns </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked out Roberto Duran.</v>

2634
02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:40.270
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the most spectacular </v>
<v Speaker 3>knockouts ever.</v>

2635
02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:43.150
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at Tommy hearns was awesome.</v>

2636
02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:47.350
<v Speaker 3>He had a big crazy afro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a back that was so wide.</v>

2637
02:03:47.351 --> 02:03:48.184
<v Speaker 3>It looks like he was a flying squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could jump off a building and </v>

2638
02:03:50.621 --> 02:03:52.900
<v Speaker 3>sort of safety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2639
02:03:52.990 --> 02:03:57.580
<v Speaker 3>he was so unusually built and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>shredded too.</v>

2640
02:03:58.030 --> 02:04:01.150
<v Speaker 3>He was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was built scary in a different way</v>

2641
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:03.030
<v Speaker 7>and then hagler</v>

2642
02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:06.850
<v Speaker 3>he was the ultimate throwback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2643
02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:10.830
<v Speaker 3>you're talking in the 19 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a throwback.</v>

2644
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:11.783
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought of him as a throwback in </v>

2645
02:04:12.821 --> 02:04:16.150
<v Speaker 3>the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you thought of him the same way,</v>

2646
02:04:16.151 --> 02:04:16.984
<v Speaker 3>so he was 30 then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kinda crazy because this is </v>

2647
02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:20.173
<v Speaker 3>like the tail end of the Haggar career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think haggard only fought is like 35 </v>

2648
02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:27.580
<v Speaker 3>and then he retired after the sugar ray </v>
<v Speaker 3>Leonard fight.</v>

2649
02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:30.630
<v Speaker 3>But this was Hagler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2650
02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:35.430
<v Speaker 3>when he to agler this was 30 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is as good as it fucking guts.</v>

2651
02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Five foot nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>160 pounds and just a fucking dynamo.</v>

2652
02:04:45.700 --> 02:04:47.210
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weird thing,</v>

2653
02:04:47.330 --> 02:04:48.163
<v Speaker 3>one of the weirdest things about Hagler </v>
<v Speaker 3>God are they still have watched that </v>

2654
02:04:50.141 --> 02:04:52.420
<v Speaker 3>dude five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had natural.</v>

2655
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:56.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm like head gear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had really thick mode.</v>

2656
02:04:56.590 --> 02:04:58.250
<v Speaker 3>Look at that beautiful right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys.</v>

2657
02:04:58.390 --> 02:05:01.300
<v Speaker 3>These guys are winging it at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

2658
02:05:01.301 --> 02:05:05.010
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing about haggars,</v>

2659
02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:08.330
<v Speaker 3>he also could take a tremendous punch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a trim.</v>

2660
02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:11.050
<v Speaker 3>That exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very smart,</v>

2661
02:05:11.051 --> 02:05:11.884
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2662
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:12.743
<v Speaker 3>What was very composed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had natural thick muscle all </v>

2663
02:05:16.721 --> 02:05:17.554
<v Speaker 3>above his ears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like his temple area was almost </v>

2664
02:05:20.201 --> 02:05:25.030
<v Speaker 3>protected by like thick muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know what that's from,</v>

2665
02:05:25.031 --> 02:05:28.270
<v Speaker 3>whether it's like from some biting </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercises that he had done because there</v>

2666
02:05:28.271 --> 02:05:32.980
<v Speaker 3>was a bunch of guys who did have some </v>
<v Speaker 3>devices to strengthen your jaw.</v>

2667
02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:37.390
<v Speaker 3>And Gerry Cooney used one before he </v>
<v Speaker 3>fought George Foreman.</v>

2668
02:05:37.391 --> 02:05:38.224
<v Speaker 3>I remember seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this thing you put in his </v>

2669
02:05:39.551 --> 02:05:40.384
<v Speaker 3>mouth and it was like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would bite down on it and lift </v>

2670
02:05:43.811 --> 02:05:44.644
<v Speaker 3>weights with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's like pulling a cord and lifting </v>

2671
02:05:46.541 --> 02:05:49.550
<v Speaker 3>weights with his jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2672
02:05:49.570 --> 02:05:52.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if hackers was just natural</v>
<v Speaker 3>just born with it,</v>

2673
02:05:52.091 --> 02:05:54.940
<v Speaker 3>but whatever it was is you can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>see it in the shape of his head.</v>

2674
02:05:55.090 --> 02:05:57.560
<v Speaker 3>You see is right in this hitman's right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2675
02:05:57.580 --> 02:06:01.900
<v Speaker 3>He pops it right at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He steps to his left arm.</v>

2676
02:06:01.901 --> 02:06:04.780
<v Speaker 3>Just goes up like a short distance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking amazing.</v>

2677
02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:08.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tommy hearns broke his hand somewhere in</v>

2678
02:06:08.471 --> 02:06:09.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the round.</v>

2679
02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:14.420
<v Speaker 3>And those fucking bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You strong muscle head.</v>

2680
02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:15.970
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You going to break something?</v>

2681
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:16.811
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2682
02:06:16.811 --> 02:06:19.720
<v Speaker 3>you throw full power bombs and hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody in the top of the head.</v>

2683
02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:20.593
<v Speaker 3>Something's to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That top of the head doesn't move very </v>

2684
02:06:22.541 --> 02:06:23.374
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where a lot of guys will break </v>

2685
02:06:24.521 --> 02:06:27.430
<v Speaker 3>their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hitting guys on the forehead.</v>

2686
02:06:29.470 --> 02:06:30.303
<v Speaker 3>This is just a crazy fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Marvin Hagler just absorbing it and </v>

2687
02:06:33.071 --> 02:06:33.904
<v Speaker 3>then he starts putting the pressure on </v>
<v Speaker 3>her and so we're like two minutes into </v>

2688
02:06:36.881 --> 02:06:37.714
<v Speaker 3>the round now and hearns is started to </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw weaker and weaker punches and now </v>

2689
02:06:41.651 --> 02:06:44.770
<v Speaker 3>haggars muscle and I'm up against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corner and just beating them down.</v>

2690
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:51.780
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the big things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hagler was his endurance,</v>

2691
02:06:52.170 --> 02:06:53.003
<v Speaker 3>his pace and just the will that he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>the will to fight a fight like this </v>

2692
02:06:57.511 --> 02:07:00.810
<v Speaker 3>where you just stand right in front of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy like Tommy hearns and said,</v>

2693
02:07:00.811 --> 02:07:02.730
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are not going to knock me out.</v>

2694
02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:04.680
<v Speaker 3>You can't knock me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand.</v>

2695
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:09.060
<v Speaker 3>You think you could knock me out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to stay right here.</v>

2696
02:07:09.061 --> 02:07:11.010
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody fought Tommy hearns like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2697
02:07:11.011 --> 02:07:11.844
<v Speaker 3>Everybody will want to stay the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>away from these punches with hagler </v>

2698
02:07:15.331 --> 02:07:18.120
<v Speaker 3>could absorb punches like almost like no</v>
<v Speaker 3>one else.</v>

2699
02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:22.450
<v Speaker 3>He got knocked down once and his whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>career and it was a bullshit knockdown.</v>

2700
02:07:23.190 --> 02:07:25.390
<v Speaker 3>The referee called it a knocked down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at it,</v>

2701
02:07:25.770 --> 02:07:26.603
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like jet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people agree that it wasn't a good </v>

2702
02:07:29.401 --> 02:07:30.234
<v Speaker 3>knock down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the fighter he fought </v>

2703
02:07:31.711 --> 02:07:32.790
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was one role,</v>

2704
02:07:32.791 --> 02:07:34.410
<v Speaker 3>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure,</v>

2705
02:07:34.710 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 3>but it was more of like</v>

2706
02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:39.340
<v Speaker 1>he like Kinda shoved him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then knocked him down.</v>

2707
02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:40.293
<v Speaker 1>You know when you was like Tommy hearns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some other boxes like Roberto Duran </v>

2708
02:07:43.811 --> 02:07:47.350
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell that they were raw talent</v>

2709
02:07:47.351 --> 02:07:48.184
<v Speaker 1>and walked into a gym and they worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>with somebody really good and they </v>

2710
02:07:50.711 --> 02:07:51.544
<v Speaker 1>learned how to box will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see Marvin Hagler and I see like the </v>

2711
02:07:54.371 --> 02:07:56.340
<v Speaker 1>guy you were talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 49.</v>

2712
02:07:56.341 --> 02:08:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I know floyd mayweather mayweather when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched them box.</v>

2713
02:08:00.761 --> 02:08:03.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is as good as it gets.</v>

2714
02:08:03.851 --> 02:08:05.380
<v Speaker 1>What I watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather.</v>

2715
02:08:05.410 --> 02:08:06.243
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just watched this fucking animal dude </v>

2716
02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:08.373
<v Speaker 1>was standing in front of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as intelligent as a boxer can </v>

2717
02:08:12.011 --> 02:08:14.740
<v Speaker 1>because we all know if I throw something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means I'm open.</v>

2718
02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:19.650
<v Speaker 1>He throw a lot being in front of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like sucking him men.</v>

2719
02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:22.210
<v Speaker 1>He's doing something to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is,</v>

2720
02:08:22.211 --> 02:08:24.970
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I see this now as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult,</v>

2721
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:27.470
<v Speaker 1>you don't see this when you're 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking through.</v>

2722
02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:31.510
<v Speaker 1>You just see stupidity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is where I see his smarts.</v>

2723
02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:32.920
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2724
02:08:33.010 --> 02:08:33.843
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's also,</v>

2725
02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:37.720
<v Speaker 1>and Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing of wisdom is something that,</v>

2726
02:08:37.721 --> 02:08:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a boxer,</v>

2727
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:42.610
<v Speaker 1>but I could see that he's got a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not like,</v>

2728
02:08:42.630 --> 02:08:43.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not doing a vandelay standing in </v>

2729
02:08:45.881 --> 02:08:47.200
<v Speaker 1>front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2730
02:08:47.260 --> 02:08:48.640
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very smart.</v>

2731
02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you watch this type of shit,</v>

2732
02:08:52.271 --> 02:08:53.104
<v Speaker 1>what you learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just such a pleasing boxer to </v>

2733
02:08:55.541 --> 02:09:00.541
<v Speaker 1>watch the way move to all that Bob and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weave in and head movement and you know,</v>

2734
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Marvin had just that like track you down</v>
<v Speaker 1>style too.</v>

2735
02:09:05.351 --> 02:09:06.184
<v Speaker 1>Like you knew he was coming forward like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marvin Hagler wasn't doing any fancy </v>

2736
02:09:08.651 --> 02:09:11.560
<v Speaker 1>foot work or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the Ali shuffle.</v>

2737
02:09:11.650 --> 02:09:14.770
<v Speaker 1>He was moving towards you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking to break you.</v>

2738
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those Mugabe's you mentioned.</v>

2739
02:09:17.171 --> 02:09:18.160
<v Speaker 1>And those other guys.</v>

2740
02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:23.260
<v Speaker 1>They were fucking killer killers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killers explained boxing in those days.</v>

2741
02:09:23.261 --> 02:09:27.100
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda today compare it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no comparison.</v>

2742
02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Look at this on the left and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it starts coming on strong.</v>

2743
02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:33.800
<v Speaker 1>So I think we're in the second round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2744
02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he stops him here.</v>

2745
02:09:35.711 --> 02:09:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I think if I remember the third boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

2746
02:09:38.731 --> 02:09:41.620
<v Speaker 1>And they stops him in the third or this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the third.</v>

2747
02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:42.581
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2748
02:09:42.581 --> 02:09:45.610
<v Speaker 1>So this is where he starts hurting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

2749
02:09:45.850 --> 02:09:49.360
<v Speaker 1>But he's got this number right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's got his number and he's not</v>

2750
02:09:49.361 --> 02:09:51.220
<v Speaker 1>even going in like a savage either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2751
02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:52.353
<v Speaker 1>very composed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch them again before this round is </v>

2752
02:09:55.271 --> 02:09:58.990
<v Speaker 1>over at each one of those types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just cutting up the fucking tree.</v>

2753
02:09:59.170 --> 02:10:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Well he's not giving them any air </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

2754
02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:02.273
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the guys that don't give you </v>

2755
02:10:04.541 --> 02:10:05.374
<v Speaker 1>any breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys the scariest because you can </v>

2756
02:10:07.841 --> 02:10:08.470
<v Speaker 1>never recover.</v>

2757
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:11.950
<v Speaker 1>So if a guy like Tommy hearns unloads </v>
<v Speaker 1>his best shit on you and then breaks his</v>

2758
02:10:11.951 --> 02:10:13.330
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's got one hand.</v>

2759
02:10:13.690 --> 02:10:15.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know which one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he hurt his right hand.</v>

2760
02:10:16.150 --> 02:10:16.983
<v Speaker 1>So he's got a left hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his right hand is all fucked up and he </v>

2761
02:10:19.841 --> 02:10:21.490
<v Speaker 1>can't really knock you out with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2762
02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:23.710
<v Speaker 1>He's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now he's trying to kind of try to hit</v>

2763
02:10:23.711 --> 02:10:28.480
<v Speaker 1>you with big left hooks and Marvin never</v>
<v Speaker 1>let some stop.</v>

2764
02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Never let them take that breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always keeps him moving,</v>

2765
02:10:31.570 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 1>always keep that pressure on him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just wielding</v>

2766
02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:36.860
<v Speaker 3>where every second of every round he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>wilting.</v>

2767
02:10:37.250 --> 02:10:39.200
<v Speaker 3>And in these exchanges where it takes a </v>
<v Speaker 3>break,</v>

2768
02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:42.410
<v Speaker 3>you hit him with some hard shots and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just keep piling it on.</v>

2769
02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Key.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pilot it on.</v>

2770
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:46.340
<v Speaker 3>That was an exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting era of boxing.</v>

2771
02:10:46.970 --> 02:10:49.160
<v Speaker 3>You could wear his socks all the way up </v>
<v Speaker 3>to your knees,</v>

2772
02:10:50.050 --> 02:10:50.883
<v Speaker 3>get athletic socks with stripes on them </v>
<v Speaker 3>for these pay per view of as I used to </v>

2773
02:10:54.291 --> 02:10:56.390
<v Speaker 3>go to the metal heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2774
02:10:56.391 --> 02:11:00.170
<v Speaker 3>So you would go to the meadowlands race </v>
<v Speaker 3>track and that would be inclusive in the</v>

2775
02:11:00.171 --> 02:11:04.070
<v Speaker 3>price of the fucking track that night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the gamble?</v>

2776
02:11:04.071 --> 02:11:07.280
<v Speaker 3>What's the fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget who I saw Marvin hagler fight.</v>

2777
02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:10.430
<v Speaker 3>How many times are the haggler flight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tummy hurts just once.</v>

2778
02:11:10.460 --> 02:11:12.680
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tommy hearns didn't want no more of this</v>

2779
02:11:12.681 --> 02:11:13.514
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who did is fight a couple times sugar </v>

2780
02:11:15.021 --> 02:11:16.980
<v Speaker 3>ray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's who I saw at the the boom,</v>

2781
02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:18.140
<v Speaker 3>the left hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>

2782
02:11:18.150 --> 02:11:19.190
<v Speaker 3>the right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>

2783
02:11:19.191 --> 02:11:20.150
<v Speaker 3>left hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right hand.</v>

2784
02:11:20.450 --> 02:11:24.560
<v Speaker 3>God Damn had Tommy her to survive this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See now Marvin is pouring it on.</v>

2785
02:11:24.620 --> 02:11:26.150
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

2786
02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:27.490
<v Speaker 3>Look at his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan did.</v>

2787
02:11:28.610 --> 02:11:31.790
<v Speaker 3>He hasn't moved this beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just beautiful,</v>

2788
02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:32.653
<v Speaker 3>beautiful box and look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same pace that he had in the first </v>

2789
02:11:34.461 --> 02:11:35.294
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean mark was just beating down on </v>

2790
02:11:37.081 --> 02:11:39.320
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just putting it on him.</v>

2791
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:42.500
<v Speaker 3>God is a great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Such a great fight.</v>

2792
02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:45.900
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tommy makes it out of the second round.</v>

2793
02:11:46.050 --> 02:11:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See My.</v>

2794
02:11:47.450 --> 02:11:48.510
<v Speaker 3>That's one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2795
02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:49.673
<v Speaker 3>in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a memory and it's like a false </v>

2796
02:11:51.811 --> 02:11:52.644
<v Speaker 3>memory and sometimes you have to watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight to see it because it's just </v>

2797
02:11:56.550 --> 02:11:57.383
<v Speaker 3>the case with everything though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many memories that you have </v>

2798
02:12:00.270 --> 02:12:01.860
<v Speaker 3>from just a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wonder like,</v>

2799
02:12:01.890 --> 02:12:03.450
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did that really go down?</v>

2800
02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Let me watch it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that movie really like?</v>

2801
02:12:07.410 --> 02:12:08.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me watch that fight again.</v>

2802
02:12:10.650 --> 02:12:12.540
<v Speaker 3>The human memory is real weird.</v>

2803
02:12:14.230 --> 02:12:16.960
<v Speaker 3>That's the saddest things about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxers too,</v>

2804
02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:19.480
<v Speaker 3>when they get older and older and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>

2805
02:12:19.481 --> 02:12:21.640
<v Speaker 3>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the memories.</v>

2806
02:12:21.641 --> 02:12:23.530
<v Speaker 3>One of the big ones that goes well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the.</v>

2807
02:12:23.531 --> 02:12:25.240
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I've heard you </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about,</v>

2808
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:29.020
<v Speaker 3>like let's say somebody has a fight on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saturday,</v>

2809
02:12:29.021 --> 02:12:29.854
<v Speaker 3>they have a close decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll watch it again Sunday when you </v>

2810
02:12:32.831 --> 02:12:35.050
<v Speaker 3>get home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you will watch it for a few days,</v>

2811
02:12:35.051 --> 02:12:35.884
<v Speaker 3>let the eat to wear off and then watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>it again and you'll see the true winner </v>

2812
02:12:39.281 --> 02:12:41.140
<v Speaker 3>if you know how to count points and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

2813
02:12:42.030 --> 02:12:44.870
<v Speaker 3>You know the problem with picking a true</v>
<v Speaker 3>winter though I,</v>

2814
02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:45.853
<v Speaker 3>I sometimes make subjective decisions in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my own head that go back and forth like </v>

2815
02:12:49.631 --> 02:12:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm not always convinced that I'm right </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you.</v>

2816
02:12:53.141 --> 02:12:56.740
<v Speaker 3>If you look at a guy who lands harder </v>
<v Speaker 3>shots but less of them,</v>

2817
02:12:56.950 --> 02:13:00.820
<v Speaker 3>like here's a good example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan Henderson versus Michael Bisping.</v>

2818
02:13:01.420 --> 02:13:05.190
<v Speaker 3>Now Michael Bisping thinks he won and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the judges think you want,</v>

2819
02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:08.020
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of people think he won because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he landed more shots,</v>

2820
02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:10.060
<v Speaker 3>controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more moments of the fight.</v>

2821
02:13:10.420 --> 02:13:11.253
<v Speaker 3>Dan Henderson thinks he won because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt Michael Bisping a couple of </v>

2822
02:13:14.801 --> 02:13:16.300
<v Speaker 3>occasions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beat him up.</v>

2823
02:13:16.330 --> 02:13:20.320
<v Speaker 3>His face was really battered and in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first round in particular,</v>

2824
02:13:20.321 --> 02:13:23.510
<v Speaker 3>he came way closer to stopping the fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>then</v>

2825
02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:29.040
<v Speaker 3>than bisping ever did to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I could see that argument as well,</v>

2826
02:13:29.041 --> 02:13:34.041
<v Speaker 3>that those moments where he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly damaged should be worth a lot</v>

2827
02:13:34.561 --> 02:13:37.080
<v Speaker 3>of points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see those arguments,</v>

2828
02:13:37.081 --> 02:13:37.710
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2829
02:13:37.710 --> 02:13:40.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who's right or who's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quite honestly.</v>

2830
02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:41.213
<v Speaker 3>I could see both arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see bisping's argument makes a ton of </v>

2831
02:13:43.651 --> 02:13:46.020
<v Speaker 3>sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He put in more work,</v>

2832
02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:48.100
<v Speaker 3>he landed more shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2833
02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:51.840
<v Speaker 3>he came back from getting really badly </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt,</v>

2834
02:13:51.870 --> 02:13:55.350
<v Speaker 3>which showed amazing heart and cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see that argument too,</v>

2835
02:13:55.860 --> 02:14:00.300
<v Speaker 3>so it's like deciding who wins and loses</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fight isn't always very clear.</v>

2836
02:14:00.630 --> 02:14:03.720
<v Speaker 3>There's different philosophies like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked to a wrestler,</v>

2837
02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:04.703
<v Speaker 3>he's way more impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy that takes the guy down a bunch </v>

2838
02:14:06.211 --> 02:14:07.044
<v Speaker 3>of times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then a guy who lands some brutal leg </v>

2839
02:14:08.371 --> 02:14:11.430
<v Speaker 3>kicks in the third round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you talk to a Moitai Guy,</v>

2840
02:14:11.431 --> 02:14:11.881
<v Speaker 3>he'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2841
02:14:11.881 --> 02:14:13.290
<v Speaker 3>well what happened in those first two </v>
<v Speaker 3>rounds?</v>

2842
02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:14.311
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he took me down,</v>

2843
02:14:14.311 --> 02:14:16.230
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't do anything once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had me down.</v>

2844
02:14:16.290 --> 02:14:18.450
<v Speaker 3>So the only thing is he's laying on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not getting hurt,</v>

2845
02:14:18.630 --> 02:14:22.050
<v Speaker 3>but in that third round I fucked him up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you listen to what he said and go,</v>

2846
02:14:22.051 --> 02:14:22.884
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a good point because that guy's </v>

2847
02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:25.830
<v Speaker 3>damaged like you damaged his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2848
02:14:25.831 --> 02:14:28.830
<v Speaker 3>There's the Kao Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Show that again,</v>

2849
02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:33.240
<v Speaker 3>so that you're a barrage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2850
02:14:33.241 --> 02:14:35.580
<v Speaker 3>This is 85.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch this shit.</v>

2851
02:14:36.020 --> 02:14:38.220
<v Speaker 3>God Damn Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2852
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:39.270
<v Speaker 3>I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2853
02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:40.890
<v Speaker 3>This is when I was a senior in high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

2854
02:14:40.891 --> 02:14:41.724
<v Speaker 3>This was a tough fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember watching this with my jaw </v>

2855
02:14:44.590 --> 02:14:45.423
<v Speaker 3>just hanging down like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I thought it was going to be a </v>

2856
02:14:50.011 --> 02:14:50.844
<v Speaker 3>crazy fight and it was a crazy fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never thought it was going to be </v>

2857
02:14:53.581 --> 02:14:55.920
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was so crazy.</v>

2858
02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:58.470
<v Speaker 3>And Marvin Hagler just mauled him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2859
02:14:58.471 --> 02:15:00.090
<v Speaker 3>he kind of shut everybody up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2860
02:15:01.790 --> 02:15:03.800
<v Speaker 3>because there was a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought Tommy hearns going to knock them</v>

2861
02:15:03.801 --> 02:15:05.570
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It thought that he had never been hit.</v>

2862
02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:07.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you went a little bit too far back.</v>

2863
02:15:08.170 --> 02:15:11.210
<v Speaker 3>This is where they checked his cut and </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2864
02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:12.590
<v Speaker 3>well they checked his cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

2865
02:15:12.710 --> 02:15:15.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tommy hearns and nailed them a couple of</v>

2866
02:15:15.501 --> 02:15:18.110
<v Speaker 3>times and Hagler is probably worried </v>
<v Speaker 3>about them stopping the fight.</v>

2867
02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Was that just God knows what the fuck I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was doing.</v>

2868
02:15:24.991 --> 02:15:28.410
<v Speaker 3>I was in Jersey and hygienists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm shit 85.</v>

2869
02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Tommy hearns had such a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just snap it out at you.</v>

2870
02:15:33.210 --> 02:15:34.043
<v Speaker 3>And what those long arms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used to keep his hand like below his </v>

2871
02:15:36.151 --> 02:15:37.580
<v Speaker 3>trunks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2872
02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:40.470
<v Speaker 3>like below the waistband of his trunks </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just pop it right in your face.</v>

2873
02:15:41.610 --> 02:15:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Like see how he did it there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit,</v>

2874
02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:46.020
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>

2875
02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That lasts right hand.</v>

2876
02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:50.040
<v Speaker 3>And then that left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2877
02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:56.470
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the greatest boxing </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights in boxing finishes of all time,</v>

2878
02:15:57.250 --> 02:15:58.870
<v Speaker 3>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially.</v>

2879
02:15:59.230 --> 02:16:00.063
<v Speaker 3>It's hard today to understand what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like when I was in high school when </v>

2880
02:16:03.251 --> 02:16:06.550
<v Speaker 3>this was going on because this was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>

2881
02:16:07.420 --> 02:16:08.740
<v Speaker 3>there was no internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2882
02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:13.360
<v Speaker 3>so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just word of mouth and radio,</v>

2883
02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:15.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd hear about it on the radio,</v>

2884
02:16:15.251 --> 02:16:17.340
<v Speaker 3>he'd see the newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd look in the box.</v>

2885
02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:19.310
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah,</v>

2886
02:16:19.390 --> 02:16:21.100
<v Speaker 3>it was paper view and you didn't see </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick.</v>

2887
02:16:21.130 --> 02:16:22.810
<v Speaker 3>You had to go somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to go somewhere.</v>

2888
02:16:23.220 --> 02:16:25.150
<v Speaker 3>He had to go somewhere and you had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch it in a theater.</v>

2889
02:16:25.151 --> 02:16:29.050
<v Speaker 3>We would pay it would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would call closed circuit closed.</v>

2890
02:16:29.410 --> 02:16:31.510
<v Speaker 3>They didn't call it paper view back then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

2891
02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:32.940
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how do we see the fight?</v>

2892
02:16:32.941 --> 02:16:33.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's closed circuit.</v>

2893
02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:35.073
<v Speaker 3>So you would go there and you'd pay a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ticket and then you go sit in a movie </v>

2894
02:16:37.571 --> 02:16:38.404
<v Speaker 3>theater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of other savages and you guys </v>

2895
02:16:39.581 --> 02:16:41.260
<v Speaker 3>would all watch the boxing match </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

2896
02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:44.800
<v Speaker 3>That's how I saw sugar ray and Hagler </v>
<v Speaker 3>close circuit.</v>

2897
02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:46.710
<v Speaker 3>I think I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

2898
02:16:46.711 --> 02:16:50.830
<v Speaker 3>I saw the haggler sugar ray at the track</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was another one that I went.</v>

2899
02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:53.950
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't more like seats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like general admission.</v>

2900
02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2901
02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:55.473
<v Speaker 3>I saw it wasn't like seats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw Tyson fight like that standing </v>

2902
02:16:58.661 --> 02:17:00.460
<v Speaker 3>room only and they put on this big </v>
<v Speaker 3>screen.</v>

2903
02:17:00.461 --> 02:17:01.294
<v Speaker 3>It was outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put on a big screen and then they </v>

2904
02:17:03.461 --> 02:17:05.290
<v Speaker 3>played the commentary to the crowd was </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

2905
02:17:05.291 --> 02:17:06.124
<v Speaker 3>It was like a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like almost like a drive in movie </v>

2906
02:17:08.141 --> 02:17:10.330
<v Speaker 3>theater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they had speakers and stuff that was</v>

2907
02:17:10.331 --> 02:17:14.320
<v Speaker 3>in vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fought Frank Bruno and uh,</v>

2908
02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:15.193
<v Speaker 3>they were fighting in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't have the money for the </v>

2909
02:17:16.421 --> 02:17:17.450
<v Speaker 3>fucking tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tickets.</v>

2910
02:17:17.510 --> 02:17:18.343
<v Speaker 3>Stupid expensive thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tyson Tyson says prime and Frank Bruno </v>

2911
02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:27.700
<v Speaker 3>might've been the best built guy to ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>box heavyweight ever.</v>

2912
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.500
<v Speaker 3>You ever see Frank Bruno?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember?</v>

2913
02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:35.820
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ last fight I watched Tyson </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight was maybe like when he knocked out</v>

2914
02:17:35.831 --> 02:17:36.890
<v Speaker 3>spinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2915
02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:39.810
<v Speaker 3>The city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend had a party,</v>

2916
02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:42.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole fucking first room,</v>

2917
02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:43.593
<v Speaker 3>the pizza them and get the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Bruno was actually before </v>

2918
02:17:45.821 --> 02:17:47.800
<v Speaker 3>spinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm wrong,</v>

2919
02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:49.690
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm wrong.</v>

2920
02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:52.540
<v Speaker 3>I think spinks was first and Bruna was </v>
<v Speaker 3>later,</v>

2921
02:17:52.541 --> 02:17:54.070
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2922
02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:55.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2923
02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:56.373
<v Speaker 3>but Frank Bruno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just pull up a picture of him so you </v>

2924
02:17:58.661 --> 02:18:00.010
<v Speaker 3>could see them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2925
02:18:00.011 --> 02:18:02.260
<v Speaker 3>you can see here from the fight that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude was yoked,</v>

2926
02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:05.470
<v Speaker 3>but some pictures of Frank Bruno just </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking ridiculous.</v>

2927
02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:06.633
<v Speaker 3>He's just act like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was an argument that a lot of a </v>

2928
02:18:12.190 --> 02:18:17.190
<v Speaker 3>boxing trainers used to use that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't be that muscular and uh,</v>

2929
02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.410
<v Speaker 3>being effective heavyweight boxer </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was.</v>

2930
02:18:20.411 --> 02:18:22.450
<v Speaker 3>So that's where Jones' son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're racist.</v>

2931
02:18:23.050 --> 02:18:24.490
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how dare you.</v>

2932
02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:26.050
<v Speaker 3>Who is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2933
02:18:26.051 --> 02:18:27.820
<v Speaker 3>how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was Roy Jones,</v>

2934
02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:31.590
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's him now though.</v>

2935
02:18:31.690 --> 02:18:33.430
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look how fat Ricky Hatton.</v>

2936
02:18:33.431 --> 02:18:34.720
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

2937
02:18:35.050 --> 02:18:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Damn Ricky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2938
02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:41.980
<v Speaker 3>there's a good picture of two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude was just jacked and that's him.</v>

2939
02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Obviously he's not even fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is like,</v>

2940
02:18:46.250 --> 02:18:50.890
<v Speaker 3>you just see without him even flexing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like not at full muscle flex.</v>

2941
02:18:51.180 --> 02:18:53.290
<v Speaker 3>He's still super jacked</v>

2942
02:18:56.410 --> 02:18:59.650
<v Speaker 3>and he'd beat a lot of guys up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Tyson marked them.</v>

2943
02:19:00.550 --> 02:19:01.383
<v Speaker 3>But that again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was when Tyson was Tyson dude says </v>

2944
02:19:03.911 --> 02:19:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Tyson.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2946
02:19:07.181 --> 02:19:08.620
<v Speaker 3>I think he stomped him twice.</v>

2947
02:19:11.100 --> 02:19:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what year was this?</v>

2948

<v Speaker 3>80 nine.</v>

2949
02:19:16.530 --> 02:19:20.780

<v Speaker 3>There was no gi test.</v>

2950
02:19:21.610 --> 02:19:23.850
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why these guys showed up.</v>

2951
02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:25.740
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Ken Norton when I was a kid,</v>

2952
02:19:25.741 --> 02:19:28.250
<v Speaker 3>Ken Norton was the biggest motherfuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>have his own my life.</v>

2953
02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:32.320
<v Speaker 3>Was he bones at those times or was </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy's natural,</v>

2954
02:19:32.590 --> 02:19:33.423
<v Speaker 3>do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did that in the seventies and it </v>

2955
02:19:34.541 --> 02:19:36.230
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't a lot of options,</v>

2956
02:19:36.231 --> 02:19:38.360
<v Speaker 3>I think is steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to check.</v>

2957
02:19:38.361 --> 02:19:40.100
<v Speaker 3>What were the options?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the Germans,</v>

2958
02:19:40.101 --> 02:19:41.800
<v Speaker 3>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they definitely had them.</v>

2959
02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.640
<v Speaker 3>The Germans had them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was definitely.</v>

2960
02:19:44.380 --> 02:19:46.810
<v Speaker 3>He just looks like an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You make an athlete there.</v>

2961
02:19:47.350 --> 02:19:50.750
<v Speaker 3>But there was one fight that Ken Norton </v>
<v Speaker 3>did look a little yoked.</v>

2962
02:19:50.930 --> 02:19:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a big guy when he fought Muhammad</v>

2963
02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Ali.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He broke his jaw.</v>

2964
02:19:54.260 --> 02:19:57.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was a serious athlete and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a former pro football player,</v>

2965
02:19:58.010 --> 02:19:58.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2966
02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says marine marine toughness.</v>

2967
02:20:02.121 --> 02:20:04.650
<v Speaker 3>And I believe Ken Norton Played </v>
<v Speaker 3>Professional Football,</v>

2968
02:20:04.651 --> 02:20:06.710
<v Speaker 3>so definitely did Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunday.</v>

2969
02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:08.380
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

2970
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:10.880
<v Speaker 3>I just know that it's Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That must be what I'm thinking of.</v>

2971
02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.430
<v Speaker 3>But Ken Norton was a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2972
02:20:13.431 --> 02:20:16.430
<v Speaker 3>He actually got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's pretty badly banged up now,</v>

2973
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:17.503
<v Speaker 3>but not from boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got in a car accident and apparently </v>

2974
02:20:20.901 --> 02:20:22.520
<v Speaker 3>got really hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that car accident,</v>

2975
02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.460
<v Speaker 3>did you see this over the weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happened in a box?</v>

2976
02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:28.850
<v Speaker 3>I did one mile one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Lopez,</v>

2977
02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:31.550
<v Speaker 3>he take his code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're afraid of Alaska is junior.</v>

2978
02:20:31.551 --> 02:20:34.640
<v Speaker 3>And then when after his trainer punches </v>
<v Speaker 3>trainer in the face.</v>

2979
02:20:34.850 --> 02:20:35.683
<v Speaker 3>So that dude went down and then he goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>up to the guys trainer and I don't know </v>

2980
02:20:38.571 --> 02:20:43.571
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck the trainer said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he goes right out to them.</v>

2981
02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:46.390
<v Speaker 3>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're throwing bombs at each other.</v>

2982
02:20:48.730 --> 02:20:50.650
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that he's pointing at him.</v>

2983
02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:53.390
<v Speaker 3>Why are you pointing at him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started it.</v>

2984
02:20:53.410 --> 02:20:55.330
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

2985
02:20:55.331 --> 02:20:57.430
<v Speaker 3>Craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are nuts.</v>

2986
02:20:59.430 --> 02:21:00.900
<v Speaker 3>But that's a nutty sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2987
02:21:00.901 --> 02:21:02.430
<v Speaker 3>like what we were talking about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would that,</v>

2988
02:21:02.431 --> 02:21:03.264
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold floyd floyd mayweather thing like </v>

2989
02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:08.580
<v Speaker 3>that kind of sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have things like that.</v>

2990
02:21:08.610 --> 02:21:12.540
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna have people that want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have 30 minute fights in the gym,</v>

2991
02:21:12.780 --> 02:21:13.980
<v Speaker 3>like 30 minute rounds.</v>

2992
02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:18.260
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous.</v>

2993
02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:20.810
<v Speaker 3>But it makes sense when you think of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this sport,</v>

2994
02:21:21.290 --> 02:21:22.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the sport really kind of </v>

2995
02:21:23.141 --> 02:21:23.974
<v Speaker 3>represents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the extreme nature of those </v>

2996
02:21:27.111 --> 02:21:28.730
<v Speaker 3>guys who compete in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2997
02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:30.013
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy that the athletic commission </v>
<v Speaker 3>got pissed at people throwing water </v>

2998
02:21:32.931 --> 02:21:35.390
<v Speaker 3>bottles but didn't get pissed at him for</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

2999
02:21:36.980 --> 02:21:37.820
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3000
02:21:38.810 --> 02:21:40.670
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3001
02:21:40.671 --> 02:21:42.110
<v Speaker 3>If you're floyd mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3002
02:21:42.111 --> 02:21:42.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how you,</v>

3003
02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:44.810
<v Speaker 3>that's how you become that guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first place.</v>

3004
02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:46.433
<v Speaker 3>You get brought up fate or there's talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>of him fighting Matt [inaudible] </v>

3005
02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:52.070
<v Speaker 3>supposedly according to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3006
02:21:52.730 --> 02:21:55.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that I know that is not true.</v>

3007
02:21:56.090 --> 02:21:57.070
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

3008
02:21:57.410 --> 02:21:59.420
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they might be.</v>

3009
02:21:59.450 --> 02:22:00.980
<v Speaker 3>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people might be trolling.</v>

3010
02:22:02.660 --> 02:22:07.030
<v Speaker 3>That might be a good fight though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fate and Mitzrian fate.</v>

3011
02:22:07.050 --> 02:22:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Orin car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I liked better in rising in Japan.</v>

3012
02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Jody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jodie,</v>

02:22:13.970 --> 02:22:15.730
<v Speaker 3>jody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

3014
02:22:15.770 --> 02:22:20.090

<v Speaker 3>fucking the Fado.</v>

3015
02:22:20.091 --> 02:22:21.350
<v Speaker 3>I love them to death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3016
02:22:21.380 --> 02:22:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I caught the tail end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fatal.</v>

3017
02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:26.340
<v Speaker 3>I quite like the two fights before</v>

3018
02:22:26.340 --> 02:22:30.480
<v Speaker 2>he got on board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right by a boy part first.</v>

3019
02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:32.370
<v Speaker 2>And you saw the fights that he won </v>
<v Speaker 2>before that?</v>

3020
02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:33.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two fights and then a beat Brett </v>

3021
02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Rogers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then um,</v>

3022
02:22:39.420 --> 02:22:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I think the next fight after Brett </v>
<v Speaker 2>riders.</v>

3023
02:22:41.700 --> 02:22:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure it was fair to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't catch a fade or in his hay days</v>

3024
02:22:44.901 --> 02:22:47.570
<v Speaker 2>when I'm trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the last couple of times I went,</v>

3025
02:22:47.580 --> 02:22:48.413
<v Speaker 2>it was like how people said they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went to the checks at the end and </v>

3026
02:22:51.121 --> 02:22:53.990
<v Speaker 2>they got all excited and went down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so that.</v>

3027
02:22:53.991 --> 02:22:58.440
<v Speaker 2>And then he got submitted by a for Doom </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vodoun which you and I discussed it.</v>

3028
02:22:58.860 --> 02:23:00.660
<v Speaker 2>This could fucking be doing them for </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

3029
02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:01.603
<v Speaker 2>And he's got a nasty a guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another guy we were talking </v>

3030
02:23:03.961 --> 02:23:05.370
<v Speaker 2>about yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nasty guard.</v>

3031
02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:06.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I saw a couple of pieces of the </v>

3032
02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:13.140
<v Speaker 2>last fight that was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassing.</v>

3033
02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:14.693
<v Speaker 2>That was fucked up.</v>

3034
02:23:15.480 --> 02:23:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fabio,</v>

3035
02:23:17.161 --> 02:23:17.994
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love his fucking jaw and he takes a </v>

3036
02:23:19.861 --> 02:23:23.370
<v Speaker 2>fight at short notice and then he fought</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Indian gentlemen before that.</v>

3037
02:23:23.430 --> 02:23:24.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3038
02:23:24.330 --> 02:23:25.163
<v Speaker 2>but Fado,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean now you just want to exploit the </v>

3039
02:23:26.611 --> 02:23:29.110
<v Speaker 2>guy and that's how people get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't drink freight.</v>

3040
02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:29.953
<v Speaker 2>All wants to fight the people that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>for fucking years and he was killing </v>

3041
02:23:32.071 --> 02:23:34.330
<v Speaker 2>people and all of a sudden he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight for a while.</v>

3042
02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Now he wants to make a comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3043
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:38.580
<v Speaker 2>His brother got out of jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His brother just got out of jail.</v>

3044
02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:39.473
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3045
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did read that.</v>

3046
02:23:40.770 --> 02:23:41.603
<v Speaker 2>Ready to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing pushups and working out in </v>

3047
02:23:46.441 --> 02:23:47.274
<v Speaker 2>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to come out jacked new </v>

3048
02:23:48.810 --> 02:23:50.710
<v Speaker 2>tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like.</v>

3049
02:23:50.830 --> 02:23:51.663
<v Speaker 2>He just wants to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want them to be able to fight just </v>

3050
02:23:53.551 --> 02:23:55.320
<v Speaker 2>like I wanted them to be able to fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was 20.</v>

3051
02:23:55.530 --> 02:23:57.000
<v Speaker 2>I want to deal with the fight when he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>40,</v>

3052
02:23:57.001 --> 02:24:00.780
<v Speaker 2>if he wants to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not mean he knows that it's not good</v>

3053
02:24:00.781 --> 02:24:01.614
<v Speaker 2>for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows that the damage that a fighter </v>

3054
02:24:03.001 --> 02:24:04.050
<v Speaker 2>can take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been beat up.</v>

3055
02:24:04.051 --> 02:24:06.120
<v Speaker 2>He's been stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson knocked them out,</v>

3056
02:24:06.121 --> 02:24:07.740
<v Speaker 2>bigfoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked him out for doom,</v>

3057
02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:08.873
<v Speaker 2>submitted by a triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's had some goddamn wars and </v>

3058
02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:15.810
<v Speaker 2>some solid is fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only was he saw it as fuck,</v>

3059
02:24:15.811 --> 02:24:20.460
<v Speaker 2>he was solid as fuck in a division where</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are very rarely solid as fuck.</v>

3060
02:24:20.670 --> 02:24:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Like heavyweight is traditionally like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>division,</v>

3061
02:24:23.940 --> 02:24:27.180
<v Speaker 2>at least in the UFC where the title </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes real quick.</v>

3062
02:24:27.220 --> 02:24:28.053
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too hard to maintain for whatever </v>

3063
02:24:30.001 --> 02:24:30.834
<v Speaker 2>reason or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up until now it's been but fate or he </v>

3064
02:24:34.501 --> 02:24:35.334
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he lost it anybody for </v>

3065
02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:41.730
<v Speaker 2>more than 10 years and years and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought very good fighters over there.</v>

3066
02:24:41.770 --> 02:24:43.950
<v Speaker 2>He fought very good fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he fought cro,</v>

3067
02:24:43.951 --> 02:24:44.611
<v Speaker 2>cop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cro,</v>

3068
02:24:44.611 --> 02:24:45.181
<v Speaker 2>cop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cro,</v>

3069
02:24:45.181 --> 02:24:46.014
<v Speaker 2>cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when cro cop was streaking and </v>

3070
02:24:48.811 --> 02:24:50.820
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he essentially out kickbox Cro,</v>

3071
02:24:50.821 --> 02:24:52.020
<v Speaker 2>cop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

3072
02:24:52.021 --> 02:24:52.854
<v Speaker 2>That's what he did in that pride fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of striking involved in </v>

3073
02:24:54.991 --> 02:24:59.910
<v Speaker 2>that fight and a fade or one he won that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight like pretty clearly.</v>

3074
02:24:59.911 --> 02:25:03.360
<v Speaker 2>And again that was when cro cop was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his prime and cro.</v>

3075
02:25:03.361 --> 02:25:06.210
<v Speaker 2>Cop had plenty of chances to stand with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and he couldn't.</v>

3076
02:25:06.690 --> 02:25:10.020
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't get the deal closed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was that fight.</v>

3077
02:25:10.021 --> 02:25:10.854
<v Speaker 2>That was a big fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Submitting Mark Coleman when Mark </v>

3078
02:25:12.930 --> 02:25:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Coleman was a fucking beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a big.</v>

3079
02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:16.093
<v Speaker 2>That was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few fights that were really </v>

3080
02:25:17.311 --> 02:25:18.144
<v Speaker 2>big deals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there was a fight that didn't </v>

3081
02:25:19.741 --> 02:25:21.690
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the biggest one though.</v>

3082
02:25:21.691 --> 02:25:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Minataro the Minataro fight.</v>

3083
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:27.400
<v Speaker 2>When Tara was in his prime and fate or </v>
<v Speaker 2>beat him down,</v>

3084
02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:28.473
<v Speaker 2>that is probably is most impressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>because minotauro back then was fucking </v>

3085
02:25:33.071 --> 02:25:35.500
<v Speaker 2>scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was really good.</v>

3086
02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean the minute that triangled Mark </v>
<v Speaker 2>Coleman Minute Toro,</v>

3087
02:25:41.170 --> 02:25:45.520
<v Speaker 2>that was just anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got a hold of your neck like you were</v>

3088
02:25:45.521 --> 02:25:46.920
<v Speaker 2>getting choked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3089
02:25:46.930 --> 02:25:47.763
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was bringing Jujitsu at a super high </v>

3090
02:25:50.891 --> 02:25:51.724
<v Speaker 2>level to the heavyweight division.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about minotauro was he </v>

3091
02:25:54.791 --> 02:25:56.800
<v Speaker 2>could take a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could take a shot,</v>

3092
02:25:56.801 --> 02:25:58.530
<v Speaker 2>especially in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nobody.</v>

3093
02:25:58.540 --> 02:25:59.720
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

3094
02:25:59.730 --> 02:26:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3095
02:26:00.690 --> 02:26:02.530
<v Speaker 2>he didn't feel pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd crack him.</v>

3096
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:04.170
<v Speaker 2>He would take shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he'd finished you,</v>

3097
02:26:04.420 --> 02:26:07.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cro cop beat the shit out of Minotauro</v>

3098
02:26:07.391 --> 02:26:10.540
<v Speaker 2>for one round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean beat the shit out of him and then</v>

3099
02:26:10.541 --> 02:26:12.970
<v Speaker 2>he had kicked them at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first round,</v>

3100
02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:16.930
<v Speaker 2>like boom and minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tarell thought they stopped the fight,</v>

3101
02:26:16.931 --> 02:26:18.190
<v Speaker 2>but it was actually the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>round.</v>

3102
02:26:18.370 --> 02:26:19.850
<v Speaker 2>He thought they stopped the fight with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the referee.</v>

3103
02:26:19.851 --> 02:26:21.210
<v Speaker 2>So that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3104
02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:23.200
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're not going to stop this.</v>

3105
02:26:23.490 --> 02:26:24.011
<v Speaker 2>And the guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3106
02:26:24.011 --> 02:26:24.380
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3107
02:26:24.380 --> 02:26:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Just the end of the eyes like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3108
02:26:25.511 --> 02:26:28.360
<v Speaker 2>good segue around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Starts shoots in,</v>

3109
02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:29.710
<v Speaker 2>takes Cro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cop down,</v>

3110
02:26:29.810 --> 02:26:30.750
<v Speaker 2>armbars him.</v>

3111
02:26:32.780 --> 02:26:36.040
<v Speaker 2>He was just so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fade or beat him down,</v>

3112
02:26:36.041 --> 02:26:36.874
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fatal heart.</v>

3113
02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:39.430
<v Speaker 2>Beat him down and it was a scary beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

3114
02:26:39.431 --> 02:26:40.264
<v Speaker 2>Like he had been a when the corner and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was ground and pounding them with </v>

3115
02:26:43.901 --> 02:26:48.160
<v Speaker 2>these for Roche's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those casting punches that fade orthros.</v>

3116
02:26:48.460 --> 02:26:50.770
<v Speaker 2>He's not punching like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like straight.</v>

3117
02:26:50.980 --> 02:26:51.813
<v Speaker 2>He's throwing these crazy like circular </v>
<v Speaker 2>hammers that are going around your </v>

3118
02:26:56.651 --> 02:26:57.484
<v Speaker 2>gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're holding your gloves up in </v>

3119
02:26:59.351 --> 02:27:00.184
<v Speaker 2>front of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to defend yourself and he's </v>

3120
02:27:01.571 --> 02:27:02.404
<v Speaker 2>thrown these whipping punches that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going behind the gloves and smashing </v>

3121
02:27:06.281 --> 02:27:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Minataro his face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

3122
02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:11.050
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the worst beat downs you </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever saw.</v>

3123
02:27:11.051 --> 02:27:16.030
<v Speaker 2>A ground and pound and pride like </v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped in a corner because he just.</v>

3124
02:27:16.270 --> 02:27:17.103
<v Speaker 2>He just worked a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't put some ferocious punches </v>

3125
02:27:18.701 --> 02:27:19.900
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot of people would have been able</v>

3126
02:27:19.901 --> 02:27:21.490
<v Speaker 2>to take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He broke his cheekbone.</v>

3127
02:27:22.410 --> 02:27:23.680
<v Speaker 2>He hit him with some bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3128
02:27:24.310 --> 02:27:25.143
<v Speaker 2>but that was when Fado was fader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at that fight with </v>

3129
02:27:28.721 --> 02:27:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Minataro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at that fight with cro cop like</v>

3130
02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:34.300
<v Speaker 2>some of his best performances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt he's,</v>

3131
02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:38.020
<v Speaker 2>if he's not the greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's between him and Cain Velasquez,</v>

3132
02:27:38.050 --> 02:27:38.883
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as the two greatest heavyweights </v>

3133
02:27:40.300 --> 02:27:41.133
<v Speaker 2>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then honorable consideration to </v>

3134
02:27:44.110 --> 02:27:49.030
<v Speaker 2>fabrizio verdon like fabrice overdoing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite getting killed with one punch by</v>

3135
02:27:49.031 --> 02:27:49.864
<v Speaker 2>steep meo chick still submitted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cain Velasquez submitted Minataro and </v>

3136
02:27:53.771 --> 02:27:57.130
<v Speaker 2>submitted fader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He submitted three all time greats.</v>

3137
02:27:57.310 --> 02:27:58.143
<v Speaker 2>So those are the three that I think you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to take into consideration is the </v>

3138
02:28:00.611 --> 02:28:01.444
<v Speaker 2>greatest of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that you would look and </v>

3139
02:28:03.851 --> 02:28:05.950
<v Speaker 2>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well more people.</v>

3140
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how many people beat each guy,</v>

3141
02:28:08.650 --> 02:28:09.483
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people beat Minotauro versus </v>

3142
02:28:10.691 --> 02:28:13.790
<v Speaker 2>how many people beat fade or versus how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people became.</v>

3143
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:17.020
<v Speaker 2>And Kenny count all that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

3144
02:28:17.270 --> 02:28:18.210
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3145
02:28:18.220 --> 02:28:20.020
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really make sense.</v>

3146
02:28:20.050 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Like trying to figure out who's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest of all time,</v>

3147
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:25.190
<v Speaker 2>who gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it is a moral new guy comes along</v>

3148
02:28:25.191 --> 02:28:27.050
<v Speaker 2>and we've been waiting some time for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

3149
02:28:27.230 --> 02:28:30.370
<v Speaker 2>The thing about fate or those that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>did it for so long.</v>

3150
02:28:30.470 --> 02:28:32.660
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did it for the longest time when I,</v>

3151
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I tapped into them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

3152
02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:40.300
<v Speaker 2>towards the end and when he lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got the arm bar from reduce was like,</v>

3153
02:28:40.761 --> 02:28:41.594
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you could see the deterioration </v>

3154
02:28:44.690 --> 02:28:45.523
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to explore them at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>time with the UFC that were asking for </v>

3155
02:28:49.521 --> 02:28:50.354
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know what they want to do with </v>

3156
02:28:51.201 --> 02:28:53.240
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like they knew something.</v>

3157
02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:57.950
<v Speaker 2>You're following me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when that team calls you up,</v>

3158
02:28:57.951 --> 02:29:02.540
<v Speaker 2>when they try to give you the home run </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking champion or the last eight years</v>

3159
02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:05.120
<v Speaker 2>miraculously on a Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3160
02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:05.953
<v Speaker 2>Like why do I deserve this fucking call?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew something and he started </v>

3161
02:29:09.591 --> 02:29:12.050
<v Speaker 2>losing a couple of fights and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>retired shortly after.</v>

3162
02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lost three in a row.</v>

3163
02:29:13.540 --> 02:29:15.290
<v Speaker 2>It's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which was crazy.</v>

3164
02:29:15.770 --> 02:29:19.070
<v Speaker 2>And the first one he loses by </v>
<v Speaker 2>submission,</v>

3165
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:21.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a mistake.</v>

3166
02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:24.650
<v Speaker 2>He followed her doomed to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hit him,</v>

3167
02:29:24.651 --> 02:29:26.910
<v Speaker 2>he had him hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought he had him hurt him,</v>

3168
02:29:27.170 --> 02:29:29.570
<v Speaker 2>just set a trap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>locked them up tight,</v>

3169
02:29:29.870 --> 02:29:32.690
<v Speaker 2>gotten with that nasty yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the second one was bad.</v>

3170
02:29:32.900 --> 02:29:33.733
<v Speaker 2>Second one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fought big foot and that was one big </v>

3171
02:29:35.691 --> 02:29:36.524
<v Speaker 2>foot was big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's been big for us on that </v>

3172
02:29:37.881 --> 02:29:38.714
<v Speaker 2>testosterone to they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when they allowed them to do it </v>

3173
02:29:40.761 --> 02:29:43.070
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigfoot had a pituitary gland tumor,</v>

3174
02:29:43.130 --> 02:29:43.963
<v Speaker 2>so he had like legitimate gigantism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy who actually needed </v>

3175
02:29:46.491 --> 02:29:49.610
<v Speaker 2>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really did need it and it was,</v>

3176
02:29:51.250 --> 02:29:55.460
<v Speaker 2>and a door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just boom,</v>

3177
02:29:55.461 --> 02:29:56.570
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

3178
02:29:56.570 --> 02:29:57.403
<v Speaker 2>He stopped them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people forget that big foot despite the </v>

3179

<v Speaker 2>not just despite rather,</v>

3180
02:30:05.061 --> 02:30:07.040

<v Speaker 2>as well as being an enormous guy,</v>

3181
02:30:07.250 --> 02:30:09.530
<v Speaker 2>he's also a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black </v>
<v Speaker 2>belt.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You just kind of better control.</v>

3406
02:40:08.980 --> 02:40:09.813
<v Speaker 4>But what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at this and it didn't look </v>

3407
02:40:11.661 --> 02:40:13.800
<v Speaker 4>intentional to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean elite.</v>

3408
02:40:13.830 --> 02:40:16.050
<v Speaker 4>You could definitely argue that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>intentional.</v>

3409
02:40:16.350 --> 02:40:21.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean it seems like the guy is sliding </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's on top of him already.</v>

3410
02:40:21.420 --> 02:40:24.900
<v Speaker 4>He's got to kind of roll with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he knew that he was hitting</v>

3411
02:40:24.901 --> 02:40:27.230
<v Speaker 4>him in the face now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

3412
02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:29.850
<v Speaker 4>we were just literally just talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that specific one here.</v>

3413
02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:32.640
<v Speaker 4>You can see him throughout his elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it looks like he's doing a little bit</v>

3414
02:40:32.641 --> 02:40:34.850
<v Speaker 4>extra with the elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they also,</v>

3415
02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:37.820
<v Speaker 4>they'll get into arbitration things like</v>
<v Speaker 4>they also do with some of the MMA thing.</v>

3416
02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:40.350
<v Speaker 4>They'll have a lawyers argue some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff out.</v>

3417
02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:41.333
<v Speaker 4>So what happened with that Tom Brady </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation at drug out for two years and </v>

3418
02:40:44.220 --> 02:40:45.960
<v Speaker 4>they finally just took us four game </v>
<v Speaker 4>suspension.</v>

3419
02:40:46.300 --> 02:40:47.250
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know man.</v>

3420
02:40:47.251 --> 02:40:48.080
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to say.</v>

3421
02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem we're having is Joe Rogan is</v>

3422
02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:50.421
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3423
02:40:50.421 --> 02:40:51.254
<v Speaker 1>I go back and I look at my high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at the kids I grew up in those </v>

3424
02:40:54.561 --> 02:40:56.780
<v Speaker 1>four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew how they practiced.</v>

3425
02:40:57.230 --> 02:41:00.380
<v Speaker 1>I knew how they worked out and I knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they hit each other.</v>

3426
02:41:00.620 --> 02:41:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then some of them went on to college</v>

3427
02:41:03.381 --> 02:41:07.520
<v Speaker 1>and did what the fuck they had to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they any of them fucked up today?</v>

3428
02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a troll.</v>

3429
02:41:12.410 --> 02:41:14.390
<v Speaker 1>That dude head to head Kale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy.</v>

3430
02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:15.273
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why five kids went on to your </v>

3431
02:41:16.401 --> 02:41:17.440
<v Speaker 1>friend's high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3432
02:41:18.660 --> 02:41:19.860
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3433
02:41:19.980 --> 02:41:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Because Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

3434
02:41:21.630 --> 02:41:22.463
<v Speaker 1>Now were bread and butter in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then show that one again and then </v>

3435
02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:27.440
<v Speaker 1>not used to get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more were bread and butter.</v>

3436
02:41:27.810 --> 02:41:29.640
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll put down to that.</v>

3437
02:41:29.670 --> 02:41:31.920
<v Speaker 1>So he was at practice with just going </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this now,</v>

3438
02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:33.533
<v Speaker 1>which is going like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you and I go to a karate </v>

3439
02:41:37.231 --> 02:41:40.140
<v Speaker 1>competition and it's a</v>

<v Speaker 1>TV at any level.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's what you're taught to do.</v>

3461
02:42:31.321 --> 02:42:34.770
<v Speaker 4>So just part of the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ball.</v>

3462
02:42:34.810 --> 02:42:36.780
<v Speaker 4>Big giant guys running around his </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulders.</v>

3463
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:37.623
<v Speaker 4>It hit him.</v>

3464
02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:39.550
<v Speaker 1>So I thought it was heading to work at </v>
<v Speaker 1>his waist.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Joe Romm back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how everything twisted.</v>

3466
02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:46.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a head contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that spine contact.</v>

3467
02:42:46.061 --> 02:42:48.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just see a fucking bolt.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's why he put his arms up.</v>

3470
02:42:54.820 --> 02:42:55.653
<v Speaker 1>Is that the guy that got knocked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was sitting there with the </v>

3471
02:42:56.830 --> 02:42:57.590
<v Speaker 1>dreadlocks?</v>

3472
02:42:57.590 --> 02:42:59.500
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were shitty editing this video.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was going to show you next.</v>

3474
02:43:01.810 --> 02:43:02.643
<v Speaker 4>This is what the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The alternative to this is right now is </v>

3475
02:43:04.810 --> 02:43:05.643
<v Speaker 4>there's some tackle non tackle nonpaid </v>
<v Speaker 4>leagues and so there's seven on seven </v>

3476
02:43:09.911 --> 02:43:11.020
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's less guys running.</v>

3477
02:43:11.770 --> 02:43:12.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't</v>

3478
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:13.720
<v Speaker 1>know that anybody wants to pay to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>this though.</v>

3479
02:43:13.721 --> 02:43:16.660
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3480
02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:22.320
<v Speaker 1>the idea is to be that haven't pads was </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you and have it helmets is good</v>

3481
02:43:23.561 --> 02:43:24.394
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now they're thinking that it's not </v>

3482
02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:26.673
<v Speaker 1>in that you're going to do things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that where you wouldn't do those kinds </v>

3483
02:43:28.781 --> 02:43:29.614
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going back to your fucking brain </v>

<v Speaker 1>if the brain doubled in 2 million years </v>

3485
02:43:37.901 --> 02:43:39.010
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking thing.</v>

3486
02:43:39.460 --> 02:43:40.293
<v Speaker 1>Our strength also doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things that we're able to do with </v>

3487
02:43:42.741 --> 02:43:45.040
<v Speaker 1>our bodies also doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3488
02:43:45.041 --> 02:43:46.690
<v Speaker 1>and even though you're a welcomed </v>
<v Speaker 1>addition,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Couldn't put weight on there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That fucking kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

3522
02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:32.980
<v Speaker 1>The biggest football player we've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>

3523
02:45:33.220 --> 02:45:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in high school.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>

3529
02:45:49.331 --> 02:45:50.164
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young tech has to be the mountain for </v>

3530
02:45:51.731 --> 02:45:52.564
<v Speaker 1>Halloween,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3531
02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:54.340
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you be anything else?</v>

3532
02:45:54.580 --> 02:45:55.413
<v Speaker 1>I would have fucking armor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just different different outfits at the </v>

3533
02:45:57.671 --> 02:45:59.030
<v Speaker 1>mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's done?</v>

3534
02:45:59.110 --> 02:46:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Just like the brain has grown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've gotten stronger.</v>

3535
02:46:02.710 --> 02:46:04.340
<v Speaker 1>We've gotten way stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

3536
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:09.550
<v Speaker 1>our workouts were particular things have</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten more on that.</v>

3537
02:46:09.750 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Was that</v>

3538
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:10.873
<v Speaker 2>what you want pinpoint for what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing or what exercise will they </v>

3539
02:46:13.431 --> 02:46:15.720
<v Speaker 2>understand what's beneficial and what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so?</v>

3540
02:46:15.770 --> 02:46:20.330
<v Speaker 2>They also understand when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>recovering epogen and guess what?</v>

3541
02:46:20.331 --> 02:46:22.140
<v Speaker 2>In 20 years we're going to be hitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>even auto.</v>

3542
02:46:22.160 --> 02:46:24.590
<v Speaker 2>You're going to see jaws flying right </v>
<v Speaker 2>off the fucking face.</v>

3543
02:46:25.380 --> 02:46:26.213
<v Speaker 2>Some MMA fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to see a George just snap </v>

3544
02:46:28.551 --> 02:46:29.384
<v Speaker 2>open to the whole of the side of some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these that somebody is going to be </v>

3545
02:46:31.791 --> 02:46:33.860
<v Speaker 2>hitting that much fucking harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3546
02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:35.120
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this,</v>

3547
02:46:35.820 --> 02:46:37.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were hitting in the seventies,</v>

3548
02:46:38.660 --> 02:46:40.810
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3549
02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:41.823
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to me is when you start</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the brain getting bigger </v>

3550
02:46:44.871 --> 02:46:47.310
<v Speaker 2>and bodies faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill him.</v>

3551
02:46:47.420 --> 02:46:50.660
<v Speaker 2>That dude was a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was accounting straight up.</v>

3552
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:51.703
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting to me about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes getting better and faster and </v>

3553
02:46:54.411 --> 02:46:55.244
<v Speaker 2>stronger and brain's getting bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wonder what it's going to be </v>

3554
02:46:58.251 --> 02:46:58.880
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

3555
02:46:58.880 --> 02:46:59.713
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk about the human brain doubled </v>

3556
02:47:00.651 --> 02:47:03.950
<v Speaker 2>over 2 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would we assume that that stopped?</v>

3557
02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:05.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just a long,</v>

3558
02:47:05.991 --> 02:47:09.110
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long process of brain getting bigger,</v>

3559
02:47:09.111 --> 02:47:09.944
<v Speaker 2>people getting bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people getting strong or people getting </v>

3560
02:47:11.451 --> 02:47:12.284
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the performance of a person </v>

3561
02:47:13.821 --> 02:47:15.430
<v Speaker 2>that don't look like if it's increased </v>
<v Speaker 2>that much.</v>

3562
02:47:15.431 --> 02:47:17.900
<v Speaker 2>It's the 19 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have we reached like this?</v>

3563
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.823
<v Speaker 2>A bottleneck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a physical bottleneck and we'll be </v>

3564
02:47:20.451 --> 02:47:23.910
<v Speaker 2>able to fix that with like genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering will know that.</v>

3565
02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:25.310
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're just going to.</v>

3566
02:47:25.370 --> 02:47:26.203
<v Speaker 2>Now we're pointing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm being even stronger and faster </v>

3567
02:47:28.131 --> 02:47:28.964
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3568
02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:30.193
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just like this is where you saw to </v>

3569
02:47:31.710 --> 02:47:33.770
<v Speaker 2>that that whole side thing gets real </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

3570
02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:35.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>

3571
02:47:35.121 --> 02:47:36.710
<v Speaker 2>they're doing a noble pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3572
02:47:36.711 --> 02:47:39.320
<v Speaker 2>They try to clean up the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop all the cheaters,</v>

3573
02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:40.820
<v Speaker 2>people getting pop left and right.</v>

3574
02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:41.833
<v Speaker 2>I go on the underground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the underground new section that mixed </v>

3575
02:47:44.091 --> 02:47:44.924
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.com</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like every couple of days some new </v>

3576
02:47:46.701 --> 02:47:49.910
<v Speaker 2>persons flagged you find out this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>got flagged that kind of got flagged.</v>

3577
02:47:50.540 --> 02:47:53.330
<v Speaker 2>So they're catching people for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what are they going to do?</v>

3578
02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:54.553
<v Speaker 2>What are they going to do when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when science starts stepping in and </v>

3579
02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:00.050
<v Speaker 2>improving people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3580
02:48:00.660 --> 02:48:03.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems to me like it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking inevitable.</v>

3581
02:48:05.410 --> 02:48:09.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean right now in mixed martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just take the USC for example.</v>

3582
02:48:09.950 --> 02:48:11.870
<v Speaker 2>If I was a manager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd tell my client,</v>

3583
02:48:11.871 --> 02:48:12.704
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck what you're </v>

3584
02:48:13.101 --> 02:48:15.050
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please don't embarrass me.</v>

3585
02:48:15.700 --> 02:48:16.533
<v Speaker 2>Don't you have a fighter's?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't want to be honest about that kind </v>

3586
02:48:19.071 --> 02:48:19.904
<v Speaker 2>of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3587
02:48:19.970 --> 02:48:21.780
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a man to man,</v>

3588
02:48:23.510 --> 02:48:25.520
<v Speaker 2>you might be on this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3589
02:48:25.590 --> 02:48:27.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them motherfuckers with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3590
02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I catch you at the time when you</v>

3591
02:48:30.291 --> 02:48:31.820
<v Speaker 2>don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3592
02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:32.673
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they don't know how to spot </v>

3593
02:48:34.491 --> 02:48:35.324
<v Speaker 2>human growth hormone very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's speculative whether or not they </v>

3594
02:48:37.881 --> 02:48:38.714
<v Speaker 2>could catch people doing that and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be one of the reasons why they're </v>

3595
02:48:41.181 --> 02:48:42.014
<v Speaker 2>holding pis and blood for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hold your sample for like nine </v>

3596
02:48:45.141 --> 02:48:47.090
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They freeze it.</v>

3597
02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:49.820
<v Speaker 2>So as the tests get better and better </v>
<v Speaker 2>and better,</v>

3598
02:48:49.821 --> 02:48:51.620
<v Speaker 2>they pull things back and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3599
02:48:51.621 --> 02:48:55.810
<v Speaker 2>if you're still competing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can find you and suspend you five,</v>

3600
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:58.970
<v Speaker 2>six years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the fucking Kinky Shit.</v>

3601
02:48:59.050 --> 02:49:01.520
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna hold my pis for nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking years.</v>

3602
02:49:02.330 --> 02:49:05.550
<v Speaker 2>What type of Freaky motherfucker you pop</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there?</v>

3603
02:49:06.050 --> 02:49:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Well they already got rid of two Olympic</v>
<v Speaker 2>gold</v>

3604
02:49:08.130 --> 02:49:11.880
<v Speaker 3>medalists from Russia to wrestlers in </v>
<v Speaker 3>2008.</v>

3605
02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:15.330
<v Speaker 3>They both are pissed positive for </v>
<v Speaker 3>something where they tested negative.</v>

3606
02:49:15.331 --> 02:49:19.410
<v Speaker 3>Then they held onto their sample and now</v>
<v Speaker 3>the screening has gotten much better and</v>

3607
02:49:19.411 --> 02:49:22.950
<v Speaker 3>they just caught them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They removed their gold medal to Olympic</v>

3608
02:49:22.951 --> 02:49:25.620
<v Speaker 3>medalists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gold medalists have no fun,</v>

3609
02:49:25.621 --> 02:49:27.480
<v Speaker 3>no studs to you look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

3610
02:49:27.510 --> 02:49:32.370
<v Speaker 3>how's that guy on steroids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just assumed these Russians,</v>

3611
02:49:32.371 --> 02:49:33.204
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a different thing going on </v>

3612
02:49:33.961 --> 02:49:37.320
<v Speaker 3>over there that's state sponsored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's trying to cover that up.</v>

3613
02:49:37.750 --> 02:49:39.270
<v Speaker 3>Felt like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

3614
02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:40.920
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they do.</v>

3615
02:49:41.220 --> 02:49:44.160
<v Speaker 3>Like that's one of the reasons why they </v>
<v Speaker 3>came back close to getting kicked out of</v>

3616
02:49:44.161 --> 02:49:46.290
<v Speaker 3>the Olympics in Rio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they were talking about kicking the</v>

3617
02:49:46.291 --> 02:49:49.560
<v Speaker 3>entire Russian team out of the Olympics </v>
<v Speaker 3>as like,</v>

3618
02:49:49.561 --> 02:49:54.561
<v Speaker 3>you fucking people have state sponsored </v>
<v Speaker 3>doping and I think their eyes,</v>

3619
02:49:54.901 --> 02:49:56.490
<v Speaker 3>it's like everybody's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>

3620
02:49:56.580 --> 02:49:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Let's just do it the right way.</v>

3621
02:50:02.610 --> 02:50:06.190
<v Speaker 3>So they just grow you into a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>age.</v>

3622
02:50:06.670 --> 02:50:08.350
<v Speaker 3>You get to a certain age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body,</v>

3623
02:50:08.351 --> 02:50:09.970
<v Speaker 3>but not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you would get to a certain age</v>

3624
02:50:09.971 --> 02:50:14.140
<v Speaker 3>and you're a wrestler at a certain days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just make you go somewhere.</v>

3625
02:50:14.170 --> 02:50:17.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's probably no,</v>

3626
02:50:17.300 --> 02:50:19.310
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot going on there.</v>

3627
02:50:19.340 --> 02:50:22.840
<v Speaker 3>And you go somewhere and the doctors </v>
<v Speaker 3>checked you out and they give you shots.</v>

3628
02:50:22.841 --> 02:50:26.560
<v Speaker 3>They tell you their vitamins don't tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>you everything that you fucking,</v>

3629
02:50:26.610 --> 02:50:28.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which this guy is another one.</v>

3630
02:50:30.100 --> 02:50:31.420
<v Speaker 3>This is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two wrestlers.</v>

3631
02:50:31.450 --> 02:50:33.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy got stripped of a bronze medal.</v>

3632
02:50:33.341 --> 02:50:35.830
<v Speaker 3>Another guy gets tripped the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's state run,</v>

<v Speaker 3>When did this article come out?</v>

3636
02:50:41.861 --> 02:50:45.710
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a reason?</v>

3637
02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:49.930
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point is 2012.</v>

3638
02:50:50.370 --> 02:50:51.203
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two guys that they just did it </v>

3639
02:50:53.461 --> 02:50:54.294
<v Speaker 3>too from the 2008 Olympics and there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure they were both gold </v>

3640
02:50:58.471 --> 02:51:01.290
<v Speaker 3>medalists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

3641
02:51:01.350 --> 02:51:02.183
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like we were talking about with </v>

3642
02:51:03.840 --> 02:51:05.250
<v Speaker 3>Usada earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

3643
02:51:05.420 --> 02:51:08.100
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird business man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird business.</v>

3644
02:51:10.030 --> 02:51:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Pino fighting's a weird business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why,</v>

3645
02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:14.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at that Floyd Mayweather,</v>

3646
02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:15.273
<v Speaker 3>Jim fight thing you like and no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>another sport would they make you have </v>

3647
02:51:17.681 --> 02:51:21.510
<v Speaker 3>like a basketball game to the death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no time moments,</v>

3648
02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:23.230
<v Speaker 3>no score in points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>

3649
02:51:23.280 --> 02:51:26.110
<v Speaker 3>just rack it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just keep going.</v>

3650
02:51:26.200 --> 02:51:27.033
<v Speaker 3>Just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And know there's periods like everybody </v>

3651
02:51:29.591 --> 02:51:32.110
<v Speaker 3>plays by the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not boxing,</v>

3652
02:51:33.690 --> 02:51:37.230
<v Speaker 3>like it's a compelling thing to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>30 minute round.</v>

3653
02:51:38.160 --> 02:51:41.220
<v Speaker 3>You could die doing that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is how people that,</v>

3654
02:51:41.230 --> 02:51:45.720
<v Speaker 3>how that shit gets exposed for real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's illegal magnet.</v>

3655
02:51:45.750 --> 02:51:48.060
<v Speaker 3>They tested comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3656
02:51:48.090 --> 02:51:50.670
<v Speaker 3>Drug tested comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like certain chains,</v>

3657
02:51:50.671 --> 02:51:54.550
<v Speaker 3>like the Improv or the punchlines like </v>
<v Speaker 3>chains at La.</v>

3658
02:51:54.580 --> 02:51:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Five clubs said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

3659
02:51:56.401 --> 02:51:57.234
<v Speaker 3>we've got a drug test you a week before </v>
<v Speaker 3>you come into our club to make sure </v>

3660
02:52:00.751 --> 02:52:01.280
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3661
02:52:01.280 --> 02:52:04.320
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine that ridiculous for that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got the entity level.</v>

3662
02:52:04.350 --> 02:52:06.190
<v Speaker 3>So like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even worried about me,</v>

3663
02:52:06.190 --> 02:52:08.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3664
02:52:08.290 --> 02:52:11.380
<v Speaker 2>just the general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about you really.</v>

3665
02:52:11.410 --> 02:52:14.710
<v Speaker 2>You're not worried about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck though.</v>

3666
02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:17.290
<v Speaker 2>If they started testing for drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about you.</v>

3667
02:52:17.680 --> 02:52:20.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrified for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just smoke reefer.</v>

3668
02:52:20.201 --> 02:52:20.740
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3669
02:52:20.740 --> 02:52:22.600
<v Speaker 2>But that's a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do?</v>

3670
02:52:22.660 --> 02:52:26.950
<v Speaker 2>It was like ups would if like a God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

3671
02:52:27.060 --> 02:52:28.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what could have happened.</v>

3672
02:52:29.170 --> 02:52:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what could have happened.</v>

3673
02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:32.423
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all they would have to do is say </v>

3674
02:52:34.150 --> 02:52:35.470
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3675
02:52:35.471 --> 02:52:36.304
<v Speaker 2>like maybe someone was really high and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were on stage and they said </v>

3676
02:52:38.561 --> 02:52:43.440
<v Speaker 2>something really ridiculous and the club</v>
<v Speaker 2>got sued and so they'd say we now have a</v>

3677
02:52:43.560 --> 02:52:47.530
<v Speaker 2>no marijuana policy because the guy was </v>
<v Speaker 2>on that fucking devil's cabbage.</v>

3678
02:52:47.531 --> 02:52:49.930
<v Speaker 2>And he said some ridiculous shit and our</v>
<v Speaker 2>club got sued.</v>

3679
02:52:50.710 --> 02:52:53.050
<v Speaker 2>That's all it would take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like one big chain,</v>

3680
02:52:53.051 --> 02:52:56.170
<v Speaker 2>like maybe Yuck Yuck or the Improv or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

3681
02:52:56.200 --> 02:52:57.680
<v Speaker 2>They just decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3682
02:52:57.850 --> 02:53:00.040
<v Speaker 2>we do not care what you do in your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

3683
02:53:00.041 --> 02:53:05.041
<v Speaker 2>but we require when you work for us that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a marijuana metabolite level of</v>

3684
02:53:05.171 --> 02:53:07.600
<v Speaker 2>less than whatever the fuck it is.</v>

3685
02:53:09.860 --> 02:53:10.693
<v Speaker 2>So all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would test you when you got the </v>

3686
02:53:12.471 --> 02:53:15.920
<v Speaker 2>town or the jet after tests you </v>
<v Speaker 2>beforehand.</v>

3687
02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:16.783
<v Speaker 2>So we just show up at your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you saw it a week before you got </v>

3688
02:53:21.250 --> 02:53:22.760
<v Speaker 2>the Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They show up at your house,</v>

3689
02:53:22.761 --> 02:53:26.150
<v Speaker 2>like you saw them and then once you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>there they're going to test you again.</v>

3690
02:53:26.151 --> 02:53:26.984
<v Speaker 2>Or do I have the whole weekend to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>one test you again at the end of the </v>

3691
02:53:30.740 --> 02:53:35.610
<v Speaker 2>week to just turn their laws?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those tests are expensive.</v>

3692
02:53:35.890 --> 02:53:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Are they the other pot ones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like from quest diagnostics.</v>

3693
02:53:40.670 --> 02:53:43.650
<v Speaker 2>That's like a thousand bucks I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which one is the one over the counter at</v>

3694
02:53:44.050 --> 02:53:46.130

<v Speaker 2>You go to quest diagnostics.</v>

3695

<v Speaker 2>cost me two grand just to come into my </v>

3698
02:53:55.041 --> 02:53:57.230
<v Speaker 2>fucking clubs to make sure the Improv </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get sued.</v>

<v Speaker 2>defamatory things in the past about </v>

<v Speaker 2>Joey Diaz and the business that we're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>here at the Improv is providing with </v>

3705
02:54:14.811 --> 02:54:16.400
<v Speaker 2>families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>families with laughter.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but I find it offensive.</v>

3709
02:54:23.630 --> 02:54:24.261
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3738
02:55:38.020 --> 02:55:38.853

<v Speaker 1>but if we could keep them around for </v>

3739
02:55:40.851 --> 02:55:44.030
<v Speaker 1>three years shooting fucking good </v>

3771
02:57:11.061 --> 02:57:12.230
<v Speaker 1>an objective point of view.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I may not even be encouraged to do </v>

<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the shit he's talking about grabbing </v>

3775
02:57:25.221 --> 02:57:26.054
<v Speaker 1>people's policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that pissed me off the most </v>

3776
02:57:28.881 --> 02:57:30.790
<v Speaker 1>about that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking 60 pound monkey me when I'm </v>

3779
02:57:38.871 --> 02:57:39.704
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I was a sophomore in high </v>

3780
02:57:43.551 --> 02:57:45.860
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this Italian girl in my class that</v>

<v Speaker 1>but she was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This girl could stop a fucking clock.</v>

3783
02:57:51.561 --> 02:57:52.394

<v Speaker 1>pounds and she was a sophomore and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>sat behind me and I just went to school </v>

02:58:00.141 --> 02:58:00.974
<v Speaker 1>with just the look at her monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't give a fuck about the rest of </v>

<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

3861
03:01:15.821 --> 03:01:20.821
<v Speaker 3>I want you to come meet the new one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this guy is the quintessential crazy</v>

3862
03:01:21.130 --> 03:01:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Texas oil man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy goes to Africa and uh,</v>

3867
03:01:31.361 --> 03:01:32.330
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Noah's Ark,</v>

3868
03:01:32.650 --> 03:01:35.250
<v Speaker 3>two of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it just shows up.</v>

3869
03:01:35.980 --> 03:01:36.813
<v Speaker 3>He stayed over in Africa for a month </v>
<v Speaker 3>just shooting things with this 24 year </v>

3870
03:01:40.631 --> 03:01:44.680
<v Speaker 3>old girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was banging Jose Sixty two.</v>

3871
03:01:45.850 --> 03:01:46.683
<v Speaker 3>He had um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a bunch of different bypasses </v>

3872
03:01:50.681 --> 03:01:54.220
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's had more than one by heart bypass.</v>

3873
03:01:54.250 --> 03:01:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Like he's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's,</v>

3874
03:01:55.770 --> 03:02:00.770
<v Speaker 3>he ain't got much time left in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy is just poverty and own woo.</v>

3875
03:02:01.660 --> 03:02:04.360
<v Speaker 3>I think if I saw a push a younger than </v>
<v Speaker 3>30,</v>

3876
03:02:04.361 --> 03:02:05.770
<v Speaker 3>I would have a bypass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3877
03:02:05.790 --> 03:02:07.420
<v Speaker 3>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My heart would split open.</v>

3878
03:02:07.421 --> 03:02:09.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like.</v>

3879
03:02:09.591 --> 03:02:10.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>

3880
03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:11.393
<v Speaker 3>I'm bored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where would you have the energy to keep </v>

3881
03:02:12.971 --> 03:02:13.880
<v Speaker 3>up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3882
03:02:14.350 --> 03:02:16.540
<v Speaker 3>Twenty two year olds that want to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>like rabbits.</v>

3883
03:02:16.800 --> 03:02:19.000
<v Speaker 3>You don't have mortgages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3884
03:02:19.050 --> 03:02:21.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have to do is be awake when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>show up for work,</v>

3885
03:02:21.320 --> 03:02:23.050
<v Speaker 3>so that's your responsibility when be </v>
<v Speaker 3>22,</v>

3886
03:02:23.080 --> 03:02:25.420
<v Speaker 3>unless you fucked up horribly and gotten</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself into some,</v>

3887
03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:28.450
<v Speaker 3>some real serious position of </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

3888
03:02:28.451 --> 03:02:30.820
<v Speaker 3>But most of us are 22.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3889
03:02:30.970 --> 03:02:31.803
<v Speaker 3>barely show up for work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've got fired and trying to get </v>

3890
03:02:33.581 --> 03:02:35.380
<v Speaker 3>another job anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're already thinking about quitting.</v>

3891
03:02:36.370 --> 03:02:37.203
<v Speaker 3>So when you're home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're home with some girls also </v>

3892
03:02:38.681 --> 03:02:41.580
<v Speaker 3>22,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got just too bizarre.</v>

3893
03:02:41.640 --> 03:02:43.090
<v Speaker 3>Just chewing up a piece of wood.</v>

3894
03:02:45.870 --> 03:02:49.420
<v Speaker 3>It's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just chopping through your own young.</v>

3895
03:02:49.620 --> 03:02:52.990
<v Speaker 3>Just trying to get rid of come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

3896
03:02:53.750 --> 03:02:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I would never happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it might,</v>

3897
03:02:57.610 --> 03:02:59.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's not gonna happen in this life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3898
03:02:59.590 --> 03:03:02.410
<v Speaker 3>It might happen all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

3899
03:03:02.411 --> 03:03:03.244
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to see a vagina if </v>

3900
03:03:04.451 --> 03:03:06.870
<v Speaker 3>it's under 40 anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've given me a heart attack.</v>

3901
03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:10.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't meet that my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have been thinking about a lot</v>

3902
03:03:10.001 --> 03:03:13.840
<v Speaker 3>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why so many cultures?</v>

3903
03:03:13.841 --> 03:03:17.320
<v Speaker 3>Think about reincarnation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why so many cultures believe you do this</v>

3904
03:03:17.321 --> 03:03:18.154
<v Speaker 3>over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why so many people think you come back </v>

3905
03:03:22.020 --> 03:03:24.490
<v Speaker 3>so you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3906
03:03:24.610 --> 03:03:26.770
<v Speaker 3>the idea that we live and we die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what.</v>

3907
03:03:27.090 --> 03:03:29.560
<v Speaker 3>That's what like someone who's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>atheist,</v>

3908
03:03:29.561 --> 03:03:32.920
<v Speaker 3>once you believe you're born and you die</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they might be right.</v>

3909
03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:33.783
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who's right or who's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is kind of fucking weird that so </v>

3910
03:03:38.231 --> 03:03:41.920
<v Speaker 3>many different cultures have this idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you live again.</v>

3911
03:03:42.290 --> 03:03:45.670
<v Speaker 3>What have you just keep doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would that freak you out?</v>

3912
03:03:46.540 --> 03:03:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm enjoying life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3913
03:03:48.580 --> 03:03:49.413
<v Speaker 3>But why is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is the prospect of doing this over </v>

3914
03:03:52.241 --> 03:03:53.074
<v Speaker 3>and over again forever?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what if you had to live your </v>

3915
03:03:54.731 --> 03:03:58.040
<v Speaker 3>childhood like your childhood?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joey was a very tumultuous</v>

3916
03:03:58.040 --> 03:04:00.860
<v Speaker 1>and crazy fucking childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it made you,</v>

3917
03:04:00.861 --> 03:04:01.694
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you knew that you had to start all </v>

3918
03:04:05.811 --> 03:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>over again and you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna,</v>

3919
03:04:08.550 --> 03:04:11.930
<v Speaker 1>close your eyes for the last time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to wake up in that hospital</v>

3920
03:04:11.931 --> 03:04:13.220
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Bergen,</v>

3921
03:04:13.221 --> 03:04:14.270
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in Cuba,</v>

3922
03:04:16.630 --> 03:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>and you can do the whole thing again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same Way,</v>

3923
03:04:19.500 --> 03:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3924
03:04:21.990 --> 03:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>You gotta get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3925
03:04:23.830 --> 03:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing it with variations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So come back like as a bird this time,</v>

3926
03:04:29.410 --> 03:04:31.610
<v Speaker 1>that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fuck with you for a couple of times</v>

3927
03:04:31.611 --> 03:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>that bring it back as an alligator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get run over in Florida.</v>

3928
03:04:35.230 --> 03:04:36.063
<v Speaker 1>Then they bring you back as a bird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a parakeet when the cat gets you </v>

3929
03:04:39.990 --> 03:04:42.250
<v Speaker 1>and then you come back as a human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3930
03:04:42.280 --> 03:04:43.113
<v Speaker 1>And then you start all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's times in your life where </v>

3931
03:04:45.281 --> 03:04:46.660
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been here before.</v>

3932
03:04:47.430 --> 03:04:50.440
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've something.</v>

3933
03:04:51.130 --> 03:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what I feel about </v>
<v Speaker 1>reincarnation.</v>

3934
03:04:53.561 --> 03:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3935
03:04:55.061 --> 03:04:56.430
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been at places and I've gotten.</v>

3936
03:04:56.440 --> 03:04:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I've been here before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>

3937
03:04:58.571 --> 03:05:00.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to think about what scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>

3938
03:05:00.431 --> 03:05:04.670
<v Speaker 1>That life is just an illusion that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns that we see are just graded our</v>

3939
03:05:04.700 --> 03:05:05.533
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

3940
03:05:05.680 --> 03:05:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows I'm having a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to refill.</v>

3941
03:05:08.561 --> 03:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Calms me down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3942

<v Speaker 1>What else we're doing comedy.</v>

03:06:37.121 --> 03:06:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called in for you.</v>

3974
03:06:39.510 --> 03:06:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I had three people calling for me I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think and he was one of them.</v>

3975
03:06:43.210 --> 03:06:46.720
<v Speaker 1>They believe Stan hope the most and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>called me on a Friday though.</v>

3976
03:06:47.660 --> 03:06:49.770
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going up in front of Mitzi Sunday</v>

3977
03:06:49.780 --> 03:06:51.000
<v Speaker 1>at nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3978
03:06:51.450 --> 03:06:53.230
<v Speaker 1>I have three minutes ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3979
03:06:53.260 --> 03:06:56.280
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I had to wait til April.</v>

3980
03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no,</v>

3981
03:06:58.020 --> 03:07:00.000
<v Speaker 1>there was an opening on the list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go down there.</v>

3982
03:07:01.990 --> 03:07:04.150
<v Speaker 1>We've seen a lot of guys come and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever go down the.</v>

3983
03:07:04.260 --> 03:07:06.030
<v Speaker 1>One of the cool things about the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

3984
03:07:06.390 --> 03:07:10.530
<v Speaker 1>one of the coolest things is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>walls are like a museum,</v>

3985
03:07:10.860 --> 03:07:13.830
<v Speaker 1>like literally like a comedy museum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no comedy museum,</v>

3986
03:07:14.070 --> 03:07:16.160
<v Speaker 1>so for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comedy museums of the wall,</v>

3987
03:07:16.161 --> 03:07:18.720
<v Speaker 1>so places like the punchline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3988
03:07:18.721 --> 03:07:19.554
<v Speaker 1>like when you go to an older club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nashville's Zania Zania national best </v>

3989
03:07:22.920 --> 03:07:26.010
<v Speaker 1>example pictures that'll make your jaw </v>
<v Speaker 1>drop.</v>

3990
03:07:26.040 --> 03:07:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3991
03:07:27.360 --> 03:07:29.280
<v Speaker 1>People that aren't even alive anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are not.</v>

3992
03:07:29.490 --> 03:07:31.800
<v Speaker 1>People that were really big and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just stopped.</v>

3993
03:07:32.040 --> 03:07:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Tom Models is a one night or out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iowa,</v>

3994
03:07:34.290 --> 03:07:37.980
<v Speaker 1>like when you go to rooms and Wyoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>cribble runs,</v>

3995
03:07:37.981 --> 03:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>which are one nighters that's different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a station.</v>

3996
03:07:40.611 --> 03:07:41.444
<v Speaker 1>Every comedy club for people at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that a bar with a certain </v>

3997
03:07:44.341 --> 03:07:47.430
<v Speaker 1>town just does comedy on Tuesday nights </v>
<v Speaker 1>every night.</v>

3998
03:07:48.060 --> 03:07:48.893
<v Speaker 1>I went to a place in Riverton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming and they had pictures of </v>

3999
03:07:50.911 --> 03:07:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Roseanne and Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roseanne and Tom Arnold together.</v>

4000
03:07:55.020 --> 03:07:56.970
<v Speaker 1>When they first started going on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road together,</v>

4001
03:07:56.971 --> 03:07:59.580
<v Speaker 1>like he had the business for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

4002
03:07:59.790 --> 03:08:01.700
<v Speaker 1>that's when they're out of Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of Denver,</v>

4003
03:08:02.490 --> 03:08:03.323
<v Speaker 1>Minneapolis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought she was married to somebody </v>

4004
03:08:04.741 --> 03:08:08.970
<v Speaker 1>else and then they got a divorce and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>left and I think she went to Minneapolis</v>

4005
03:08:08.971 --> 03:08:11.970
<v Speaker 1>for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I toured with them and uh,</v>

4006
03:08:12.660 --> 03:08:13.590
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4007
03:08:13.591 --> 03:08:16.170
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the sad things about when </v>
<v Speaker 1>a comedy club closes down,</v>

4008
03:08:16.200 --> 03:08:17.370
<v Speaker 1>you lose that museum.</v>

4009
03:08:17.580 --> 03:08:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Like they used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last stop in river oaks had pictures</v>

4010
03:08:21.871 --> 03:08:24.720
<v Speaker 1>of Stan hope when he bad long luxurious </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

4011
03:08:25.110 --> 03:08:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Remember when Stan hope had like fabio </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair stand hope.</v>

4012
03:08:30.301 --> 03:08:34.530
<v Speaker 1>He used to wear an overcoat and he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>long hair and I remember like,</v>

4013
03:08:35.130 --> 03:08:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I think I had heard that he didn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a place to live,</v>

4014
03:08:37.910 --> 03:08:38.743
<v Speaker 1>just like a car got broken into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>finals of the San Francisco comedy </v>

4015
03:08:44.761 --> 03:08:46.170
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overfilling.</v>

4016
03:08:46.330 --> 03:08:47.163
<v Speaker 1>And he went and bought like a secondhand</v>
<v Speaker 1>suit and he went back there and smoke </v>

4017
03:08:49.650 --> 03:08:52.140
<v Speaker 1>everybody with the suit on his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4018
03:08:52.141 --> 03:08:52.974
<v Speaker 1>That's where a Dane Cook's manager tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>to psych him out before he went on </v>

4019
03:08:56.631 --> 03:08:57.850
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he say to them?</v>

4020
03:08:57.990 --> 03:09:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Something Dickie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4021
03:09:00.570 --> 03:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>something Dickie like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4022
03:09:01.930 --> 03:09:03.730
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to beat him or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

4023
03:09:03.731 --> 03:09:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Like something really shitty stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>helpline of winning and crushed it.</v>

4024
03:09:11.160 --> 03:09:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I saw his son at that time was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

4025
03:09:15.880 --> 03:09:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Gyro and he's amazing now is set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that time he had,</v>

4026
03:09:20.610 --> 03:09:25.610
<v Speaker 1>he had connected the bridge from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what put me on the right path,</v>

4027
03:09:26.160 --> 03:09:26.993
<v Speaker 1>the bridge of when I watched what he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing in the half hour that when he was </v>

4028
03:09:32.311 --> 03:09:36.420
<v Speaker 1>headlining his first half hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then just the way he was delivering it,</v>

4029
03:09:36.850 --> 03:09:40.410
<v Speaker 1>his presentation when he was young at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience when they walked,</v>

4030
03:09:41.190 --> 03:09:44.260
<v Speaker 1>it was all a fucking thing of genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

4031
03:09:44.300 --> 03:09:45.133
<v Speaker 1>it hit me so hard that I didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy for about four days to gather up </v>

4032
03:09:49.650 --> 03:09:52.500
<v Speaker 1>like what am I going to do with my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if I'm not that good,</v>

4033
03:09:52.860 --> 03:09:54.160
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing this shit.</v>

4034
03:09:55.060 --> 03:09:55.893
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that time he was doing the bucket of </v>

4035
03:09:57.641 --> 03:09:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Vaginas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>

4036
03:09:59.120 --> 03:10:02.680
<v Speaker 1>some way to come up to him and asked him</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he wants to buy a bucket of roses and</v>

4037
03:10:02.681 --> 03:10:03.514
<v Speaker 1>a bar.</v>

4038
03:10:03.580 --> 03:10:04.413
<v Speaker 1>I don't need roses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a bucket of vaginas and then the </v>

4039
03:10:07.181 --> 03:10:08.014
<v Speaker 1>lady would walk out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll never forget that he said that </v>

4040
03:10:10.310 --> 03:10:12.670
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read the back of the class because she</v>

4041
03:10:12.671 --> 03:10:13.504
<v Speaker 1>walks out and then some lady in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience actually gets up and walks out </v>

4042
03:10:17.020 --> 03:10:17.771
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lady,</v>

4043
03:10:17.771 --> 03:10:20.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I should've said this one </v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

4044
03:10:21.580 --> 03:10:25.350
<v Speaker 1>People would walk and then he'd say </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to them as they were walking out,</v>

4045
03:10:25.810 --> 03:10:28.630
<v Speaker 1>but it was so brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people couldn't take it no more.</v>

4046
03:10:30.360 --> 03:10:31.193
<v Speaker 1>I loved what he was doing on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about going to a bar and </v>

4047
03:10:34.490 --> 03:10:35.323
<v Speaker 1>the g string was stuck in the girl's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing and it was in there </v>

4048
03:10:38.021 --> 03:10:39.820
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing any justice to this.</v>

4049
03:10:40.390 --> 03:10:43.150
<v Speaker 1>It didn't matter what he was doing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

4050
03:10:43.180 --> 03:10:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was really doing at that time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he came to La and the way that they</v>

4051
03:10:49.451 --> 03:10:51.990
<v Speaker 1>were trying to make that fucking squeaky</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean,</v>

4052
03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:52.833
<v Speaker 1>squeaky clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he went in and I was in the night </v>

4053
03:10:54.431 --> 03:10:58.590
<v Speaker 1>when he insulted the burn victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick people up there.</v>

4054
03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:00.040
<v Speaker 1>The Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

4055
03:11:00.041 --> 03:11:00.874
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you people depressed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy hasn't cracked a smile and now </v>

4056
03:11:03.830 --> 03:11:04.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4057
03:11:04.571 --> 03:11:08.260
<v Speaker 1>he didn't stop for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he started walking the Improv,</v>

4058
03:11:08.261 --> 03:11:09.094
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on those nights where all the </v>

4059
03:11:11.681 --> 03:11:13.870
<v Speaker 1>professionals and the Egos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying,</v>

4060
03:11:14.500 --> 03:11:15.333
<v Speaker 1>they would put him on and they would pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Mitzi shore made a mistake and </v>

4061
03:11:22.230 --> 03:11:26.880
<v Speaker 1>she started putting that motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 1>before betsy sokolow.</v>

4062
03:11:27.970 --> 03:11:30.260
<v Speaker 1>That's not a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mistake.</v>

4063
03:11:30.790 --> 03:11:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Was she had a method.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She enjoyed watching that show.</v>

4064
03:11:36.220 --> 03:11:39.320
<v Speaker 1>But once you watched it at that time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4065
03:11:39.390 --> 03:11:40.223
<v Speaker 1>I'd tell you how it is to show opens up </v>
<v Speaker 1>at what time at the comedy store and </v>

4066

<v Speaker 1>Saturdays 8:30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In those days she will put Doug Stanhope</v>

4067
03:11:49.001 --> 03:11:54.001
<v Speaker 1>one third and then he would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would hit so hard in the original.</v>

4068
03:11:56.320 --> 03:11:58.720
<v Speaker 1>They would see who first political guy.</v>

4069
03:11:59.390 --> 03:12:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Then they will have a buffalo and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't really know who stan hope was.</v>

4070
03:12:04.090 --> 03:12:06.750
<v Speaker 1>She had forgotten and she put them up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4071
03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:09.390
<v Speaker 1>the fucking nine.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They were not ready for him.</v>

4073
03:12:14.890 --> 03:12:15.723
<v Speaker 1>I remember one particular Saturday he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about lesbians with a Dick </v>

4074

<v Speaker 1>original room didn't even know where he </v>

<v Speaker 1>was going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nobody knew he was going,</v>

4085
03:12:52.220 --> 03:12:56.270
<v Speaker 1>It was the two people that follow stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in those days were in a lurch because</v>

4086
03:12:56.300 --> 03:12:59.420
<v Speaker 1>the second guy that followed Stan hope </v>
<v Speaker 1>was all fucked up.</v>

4087
03:12:59.421 --> 03:13:03.470
<v Speaker 1>He just put bad energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>general bombs in those days.</v>

4088
03:13:03.471 --> 03:13:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood wasn't ready for staying at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home and I saw it.</v>

4089
03:13:07.070 --> 03:13:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I saw that the Security Council approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stand up,</v>

4090
03:13:12.860 --> 03:13:13.940
<v Speaker 1>the Hollywood approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stand.</v>

4091
03:13:13.941 --> 03:13:16.660
<v Speaker 1>I was changed like he used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4092
03:13:16.670 --> 03:13:18.920
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were all boards.</v>

4093
03:13:19.130 --> 03:13:21.260
<v Speaker 1>They had a letter send down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

4094
03:13:21.410 --> 03:13:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all had 11 sitcoms,</v>

4095
03:13:23.070 --> 03:13:23.910
<v Speaker 1>you know they will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4096
03:13:23.960 --> 03:13:26.000
<v Speaker 1>because people will funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4097
03:13:26.001 --> 03:13:28.400
<v Speaker 1>we can name a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could sit here for two fucking hours.</v>

4098
03:13:28.700 --> 03:13:29.533
<v Speaker 1>We may have a lot of people that came to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this town who would genuinely funny and </v>

4099
03:13:32.451 --> 03:13:34.370
<v Speaker 1>then some fucking suit got to him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

4100
03:13:34.371 --> 03:13:35.204
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to write your Sitcom for these </v>

4101
03:13:36.801 --> 03:13:39.020
<v Speaker 1>people and talk about your stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>persona.</v>

4102
03:13:39.290 --> 03:13:42.740
<v Speaker 1>And then they went up there and change </v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole stand up and you know what?</v>

4103
03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:45.530
<v Speaker 1>That's funny in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really who to fuck you up.</v>

4104
03:13:45.650 --> 03:13:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened.</v>

4105
03:13:47.151 --> 03:13:47.984
<v Speaker 1>People got away from that for a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years are years 96 to 2004 people got </v>

4106
03:13:53.901 --> 03:13:54.734
<v Speaker 1>away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People still want you to build a sitcom </v>

4107
03:13:56.300 --> 03:13:59.390
<v Speaker 1>on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when that fucking idea went awry,</v>

4108
03:14:00.410 --> 03:14:01.243
<v Speaker 1>they hadn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hadn't let fucking people with a </v>

4109
03:14:02.860 --> 03:14:06.150
<v Speaker 1>little crazy and it seems like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast era.</v>

4110
03:14:06.650 --> 03:14:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Then people got to understand how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment there is.</v>

4111
03:14:10.850 --> 03:14:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Just people being themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just crazy people.</v>

4112
03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:17.730
<v Speaker 1>People like you or people like already </v>
<v Speaker 1>or people like a Dunkin started.</v>

4113
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:22.490
<v Speaker 1>People started recognizing that when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>let a guy just be himself or a girl just</v>

4114
03:14:22.491 --> 03:14:25.190
<v Speaker 1>be themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get the real thing.</v>

4115
03:14:25.191 --> 03:14:26.510
<v Speaker 1>You're going to find out what's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

4116
03:14:26.820 --> 03:14:27.653
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really makes you realize is how much </v>

4117
03:14:28.941 --> 03:14:32.480
<v Speaker 1>media does control what you watch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>see whether it's music.</v>

4118
03:14:32.481 --> 03:14:33.710
<v Speaker 1>It's comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's pretend the,</v>

4119
03:14:33.730 --> 03:14:36.410
<v Speaker 1>but there was no venue for standup like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that except for Hbo.</v>

4120
03:14:36.440 --> 03:14:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Let's pretend that right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts would not have come up in this.</v>

4121
03:14:40.821 --> 03:14:43.310
<v Speaker 1>In the last 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would know me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't know Stan Ho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4123
03:14:44.690 --> 03:14:45.450
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stan.</v>

4124
03:14:45.450 --> 03:14:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Hope you wouldn't know are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't know Duncan.</v>

4125
03:14:47.810 --> 03:14:48.643
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't know a half a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>decent comics that are floating around </v>

4126
03:14:51.500 --> 03:14:53.510
<v Speaker 1>because the people who are controlling </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>

4127
03:14:53.870 --> 03:14:54.703
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling comedy due to certain </v>

4128
03:14:56.190 --> 03:14:58.490
<v Speaker 1>criterias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youth age,</v>

4129
03:14:59.140 --> 03:15:01.820
<v Speaker 1>it all has to mix up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all has to mix up.</v>

4130
03:15:01.821 --> 03:15:05.550
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't make up and I'm not crying</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Wolfie I,</v>

4131
03:15:05.600 --> 03:15:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy with the fuck I'm doing.</v>

4132
03:15:07.491 --> 03:15:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I've done great compared to what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I was going to fucking do.</v>

4133
03:15:10.280 --> 03:15:11.950
<v Speaker 1>So I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4134
03:15:12.260 --> 03:15:14.210
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'll call somebody and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

4135
03:15:14.211 --> 03:15:15.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too old for this thing.</v>

4136
03:15:15.680 --> 03:15:16.513
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to think about what people are </v>

4137
03:15:18.060 --> 03:15:19.780
<v Speaker 1>watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can a guy like you to do?</v>

4138
03:15:19.820 --> 03:15:20.653
<v Speaker 1>You could do one or two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can either do an hbo special or you </v>

4139
03:15:22.851 --> 03:15:25.280
<v Speaker 1>can do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have uncensored radio.</v>

4140
03:15:25.281 --> 03:15:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Back then they didn't even until series </v>
<v Speaker 1>came along and Xm,</v>

4141
03:15:28.160 --> 03:15:30.020
<v Speaker 1>you didn't even have a venue on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio,</v>

4142
03:15:30.260 --> 03:15:31.093
<v Speaker 1>so you had nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had nothing to be you and your </v>

4143
03:15:33.441 --> 03:15:36.500
<v Speaker 1>stories and all your craziness where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're free like this.</v>

4144
03:15:36.980 --> 03:15:40.410
<v Speaker 1>And so it wasn't a product to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no pulse.</v>

4145
03:15:40.440 --> 03:15:41.273
<v Speaker 1>There's no market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unless you became a Kennison or a </v>

4146
03:15:42.951 --> 03:15:47.270
<v Speaker 1>dice clay or someone who got an hbo </v>
<v Speaker 1>special or a gut on Rodney Dangerfield,</v>

4147

<v Speaker 1>hbo special with the world got </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced to you being dirty,</v>

4148
03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:51.833

<v Speaker 2>There was nowhere bitch we got on Joe </v>

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't,</v>

03:16:12.660 --> 03:16:13.493
<v Speaker 2>they didn't respect you guys know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in they thought because you guys </v>

4158

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was making a bad choice by bringing </v>

<v Speaker 2>I didn't bother now,</v>

4164
03:16:29.280 --> 03:16:31.630
<v Speaker 2>although some people probably St Joe you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were quietly.</v>

4165
03:16:31.660 --> 03:16:32.890
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I blacked out for a while.</v>

4166
03:16:32.891 --> 03:16:35.280
<v Speaker 2>I went deep is a lot in that.</v>

4169
03:16:43.681 --> 03:16:46.440

<v Speaker 2>and I decided to just see what happens.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4172
03:16:49.740 --> 03:16:51.000
<v Speaker 2>The other shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to commit to it.</v>

4173

<v Speaker 2>I liked this little sprayer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just look for when it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You should watch that show.</v>

4241
03:19:49.380 --> 03:19:50.213
<v Speaker 1>I W I knew Selia crews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my mom had the bar in the early </v>

4242
03:19:55.870 --> 03:19:56.681
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom was tired,</v>

4243
03:19:56.681 --> 03:19:57.514
<v Speaker 1>that was Selia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was going to Catholic school so </v>

4244
03:19:59.231 --> 03:20:00.064
<v Speaker 1>whenever she came by I wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would see her at the bar and I had </v>

4245
03:20:02.861 --> 03:20:05.600
<v Speaker 1>seen her a few times but I didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of what I like,</v>

4246
03:20:05.601 --> 03:20:09.790
<v Speaker 1>like three songs and Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like a folk lore like this fucking</v>

4247
03:20:09.791 --> 03:20:14.110
<v Speaker 1>like be people in Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is she like a waste?</v>

4248
03:20:14.111 --> 03:20:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I watched this fucking show and I'm up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to episode 30.</v>

4249
03:20:17.830 --> 03:20:18.663
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they taped it like a Spanish </v>

4250
03:20:20.531 --> 03:20:21.550
<v Speaker 1>novella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4251
03:20:21.551 --> 03:20:22.384
<v Speaker 1>Which again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody really liked it unless you grew </v>

4252
03:20:24.311 --> 03:20:25.144
<v Speaker 1>up on Spanish novellus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it fills you in on what was going </v>

4253
03:20:29.741 --> 03:20:30.010
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

4254
03:20:30.010 --> 03:20:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Like she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right now,</v>

4255
03:20:32.320 --> 03:20:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Castro just took her fucking house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you say she taped,</v>

4256
03:20:35.560 --> 03:20:38.470
<v Speaker 1>they taped like a Spanish novella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean like Telemundo?</v>

4257
03:20:38.471 --> 03:20:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Novella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they made this into a TV show,</v>

4258
03:20:40.480 --> 03:20:43.510
<v Speaker 1>80 fucken episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm up to 33,</v>

4259
03:20:43.540 --> 03:20:46.420
<v Speaker 1>80 episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight episodes the first season.</v>

4260
03:20:46.900 --> 03:20:47.733
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just find somebody called me and turn </v>

4261
03:20:49.581 --> 03:20:52.150
<v Speaker 1>me onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not that interesting.</v>

4262
03:20:52.151 --> 03:20:52.984
<v Speaker 1>Like the singing is cool and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up and listening to some of </v>

4263
03:20:56.471 --> 03:20:57.304
<v Speaker 1>those songs and my mom is ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on as they break down the </v>

4264
03:21:01.390 --> 03:21:03.190
<v Speaker 1>gay thing in Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I told you,</v>

4265
03:21:03.530 --> 03:21:05.740
<v Speaker 1>they used to take them shark island </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and throw him off the boat.</v>

4266
03:21:06.400 --> 03:21:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Like this fucking kid was saying my </v>
<v Speaker 1>father left the house because I was gay.</v>

4267
03:21:09.971 --> 03:21:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Like it was so taboo when if you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark skinned,</v>

4268
03:21:13.630 --> 03:21:16.300
<v Speaker 1>like if you were any dark skin at all in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

4269
03:21:16.720 --> 03:21:17.710
<v Speaker 1>they would hate you.</v>

4270
03:21:17.710 --> 03:21:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogen so when Castro got in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and made it easier,</v>

4271
03:21:21.370 --> 03:21:25.120
<v Speaker 1>but Tiesta was robin people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Pisa was just a piece of shit.</v>

4272
03:21:25.390 --> 03:21:26.223
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these two were such a piece of shit </v>

4273
03:21:27.820 --> 03:21:28.653
<v Speaker 1>that 20 years after he was gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were hunting down his soldiers in </v>

4274
03:21:31.841 --> 03:21:34.990
<v Speaker 1>the United States like fucking Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>

4275
03:21:35.380 --> 03:21:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Like they would get hunted down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These groups of Cubans were hunting them</v>

4276
03:21:38.141 --> 03:21:40.450
<v Speaker 1>down and fucking beat them and shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and shit.</v>

4277
03:21:40.930 --> 03:21:44.170
<v Speaker 1>That's how much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it had become like it.</v>

4278
03:21:44.290 --> 03:21:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Towards the last five years of Cuba </v>
<v Speaker 1>become like,</v>

4279
03:21:46.881 --> 03:21:48.610
<v Speaker 1>if I pulled you over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just beat you,</v>

4280
03:21:48.650 --> 03:21:50.870
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took your car and that was it.</v>

4281
03:21:51.500 --> 03:21:53.090
<v Speaker 1>But for eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

4282
03:21:53.270 --> 03:21:54.103
<v Speaker 1>Fidel sat in those mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like taken over La and sending up </v>

4283
03:21:58.941 --> 03:22:03.350
<v Speaker 1>and fucking San Francisco for eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>years waiting for the opportunity and it</v>

4284
03:22:03.351 --> 03:22:05.300
<v Speaker 1>breaks it down along the way how they.</v>

4285
03:22:05.690 --> 03:22:09.410
<v Speaker 1>It was easy for them to take home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like stealing for.</v>

4286
03:22:09.500 --> 03:22:11.930
<v Speaker 1>They were waiting for fidelity to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the revolution.</v>

4287
03:22:12.020 --> 03:22:13.580
<v Speaker 1>It is pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still in control.</v>

4288
03:22:13.610 --> 03:22:15.720
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this real,</v>

4289
03:22:15.721 --> 03:22:16.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I knew this,</v>

4290
03:22:16.810 --> 03:22:19.070
<v Speaker 1>anybody like that out there now besides </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

4291
03:22:19.100 --> 03:22:19.933
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that took a country by force and still </v>

4292
03:22:21.681 --> 03:22:24.060
<v Speaker 1>has control of it all these years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4293
03:22:24.061 --> 03:22:26.400
<v Speaker 1>he just wanted to people's houses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

4294
03:22:26.401 --> 03:22:27.234
<v Speaker 1>that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4295
03:22:27.260 --> 03:22:32.260
<v Speaker 1>this show doesn't touch on the casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he walked into the casinos and said,</v>

4296
03:22:34.290 --> 03:22:35.570
<v Speaker 1>go ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call the mafia.</v>

4297

<v Speaker 1>It's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You show them.</v>

4299
03:22:43.671 --> 03:22:45.610
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they do to them.</v>

4300
03:22:45.810 --> 03:22:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Just took him on the arm and walked into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the airport.</v>

4301
03:22:48.610 --> 03:22:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I have a nice life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4302
03:22:51.380 --> 03:22:53.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they nationalized all the businesses.</v>

4303
03:22:55.520 --> 03:22:57.680
<v Speaker 1>It was just something that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about.</v>

4304
03:22:57.680 --> 03:22:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4305
03:22:59.051 --> 03:23:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Americanized.</v>

4306
03:23:00.351 --> 03:23:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is the acting sensation.</v>

4307
03:23:04.681 --> 03:23:06.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just a little too much music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you.</v>

4309
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:11.030

<v Speaker 1>you say that she was huge in Cuba.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the best looking fucking monster out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

4326
03:23:54.260 --> 03:23:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was her argument also.</v>

4327
03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:58.010
<v Speaker 1>She was Haitian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was Cuban,</v>

4328
03:23:58.870 --> 03:24:00.580
<v Speaker 1>she was Haitian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4329
03:24:01.780 --> 03:24:04.580
<v Speaker 1>She probably had nation blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

4330
03:24:04.581 --> 03:24:07.080
<v Speaker 1>but she was fucking Cuban.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

4331
03:24:08.030 --> 03:24:08.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said she wouldn't sell records </v>

4332
03:24:09.651 --> 03:24:10.484
<v Speaker 1>because she was ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wouldn't sell records because she </v>

4333
03:24:12.861 --> 03:24:16.370
<v Speaker 1>was dark skinned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like her actual music and the show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking intense.</v>

4336
03:24:20.210 --> 03:24:22.160
<v Speaker 1>But it showed like three star goals for </v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

4337
03:24:22.161 --> 03:24:24.900
<v Speaker 1>like she wasn't going to make it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking dark thing.</v>

4338
03:24:24.901 --> 03:24:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4339
03:24:25.941 --> 03:24:27.560

<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

4340
03:24:27.561 --> 03:24:29.900
<v Speaker 1>like when Fidel fucking goes into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's kind of different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>

4353
03:25:02.310 --> 03:25:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Even for me it was a little different at</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

4354
03:25:04.590 --> 03:25:05.423
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4383
03:26:13.711 --> 03:26:18.180
<v Speaker 2>thrones is that it's a giant movie.</v>

<v Speaker 2>a regular movies like it's not enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>time to tell a story 90 minutes and not </v>

4387

<v Speaker 2>enough time to tell a story and you're </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like they're figuring out a totally</v>

4389
03:26:31.351 --> 03:26:33.720
<v Speaker 2>new thing and it totally new thing </v>

4391
03:26:36.451 --> 03:26:39.060

<v Speaker 2>connected but not sort of the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it now.</v>

4394
03:26:44.310 --> 03:26:45.143
<v Speaker 2>The way they're doing it now is with </v>
<v Speaker 2>nudity and swearing and violence and </v>

4395
03:26:48.091 --> 03:26:51.810
<v Speaker 2>sexuality and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all no holds barred.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the opportunity.</v>

4424
03:28:10.031 --> 03:28:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I was going to try to work a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaner.</v>

4425
03:28:11.650 --> 03:28:12.483
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want them to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want them to look at me and </v>

4426
03:28:15.461 --> 03:28:16.240
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

4427
03:28:16.240 --> 03:28:18.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you why I'm a fan of MMA.</v>

4428
03:28:18.550 --> 03:28:21.150
<v Speaker 1>When I see growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love when I watch it,</v>

4429
03:28:21.220 --> 03:28:22.053
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a fight.</v>

4430
03:28:22.330 --> 03:28:25.180
<v Speaker 1>When economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rego fought Nick Diaz the second time,</v>

4431
03:28:25.720 --> 03:28:26.553
<v Speaker 1>I was so happy that I finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody is doing what I'm talking </v>

4432
03:28:28.841 --> 03:28:30.160
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go back,</v>

4433
03:28:30.161 --> 03:28:30.994
<v Speaker 1>you look at your mistakes and you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to and correct them at the same </v>

4434
03:28:32.921 --> 03:28:34.990
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You show up with a new weapon.</v>

4435
03:28:35.320 --> 03:28:36.153
<v Speaker 1>Don't keep telling me that you're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardest hitter in the UFC lightweight </v>

4436
03:28:38.321 --> 03:28:39.154
<v Speaker 1>division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear that because it's </v>

4437
03:28:40.001 --> 03:28:42.790
<v Speaker 1>not about the hardest headed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear that no more.</v>

4438
03:28:42.791 --> 03:28:46.150
<v Speaker 1>So I thought about my special from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective and I go,</v>

4439
03:28:46.151 --> 03:28:48.840
<v Speaker 1>if I watch my special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I do come on the foot joke.</v>

4440
03:28:48.841 --> 03:28:51.040
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna know he never grew from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never really.</v>

4441
03:28:51.430 --> 03:28:53.800
<v Speaker 1>So I really wanted to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4442
03:28:53.801 --> 03:28:54.634
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but see that's they fuck with your head </v>

4443
03:28:56.421 --> 03:28:58.710
<v Speaker 1>band because those come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foot jokes are great.</v>

4444
03:28:58.710 --> 03:28:59.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like them.</v>

4445
03:28:59.651 --> 03:29:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to kill time and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>lazy,</v>

4446
03:29:02.650 --> 03:29:06.460
<v Speaker 1>but I just wanted to do something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was me but not.</v>

4447
03:29:07.150 --> 03:29:07.983
<v Speaker 1>So I worked at that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first ride tried to be Jerry </v>

4448
03:29:10.540 --> 03:29:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld and it kind of worked a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

4449
03:29:12.200 --> 03:29:14.920
<v Speaker 1>The technique was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the old business wasn't.</v>

4450
03:29:14.921 --> 03:29:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Then I thought about the and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

4451
03:29:17.710 --> 03:29:18.543
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to change this all up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go out this motherfucker </v>

4452
03:29:20.660 --> 03:29:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Capello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So second fellow human that's been their</v>

4453
03:29:26.900 --> 03:29:28.810
<v Speaker 1>management order.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Capello whatever the jokes.</v>

4455
03:29:32.561 --> 03:29:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to use old jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing like that.</v>

4456
03:29:34.361 --> 03:29:36.640
<v Speaker 1>It was all fresh stuff and it worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

4457
03:29:36.641 --> 03:29:38.770
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy I did it 25 years.</v>

4508
03:32:01.851 --> 03:32:04.160
<v Speaker 2>I think these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these new networks are going to open</v>

4509
03:32:04.161 --> 03:32:06.500
<v Speaker 2>up the same way that Netflix has done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to.</v>

4510
03:32:06.520 --> 03:32:07.353
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good model and they're realizing </v>

4511
03:32:09.501 --> 03:32:11.480
<v Speaker 2>that now that's going to be the future.</v>

4512
03:32:11.480 --> 03:32:14.810
<v Speaker 2>It's these networks like CBS and NBC and</v>
<v Speaker 2>ABC.</v>

4513
03:32:15.140 --> 03:32:15.973
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have a hard time in a </v>

4514
03:32:17.210 --> 03:32:18.090
<v Speaker 2>few years staying afloat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4515
03:32:18.091 --> 03:32:19.940
<v Speaker 2>let's think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's Netflix?</v>

4516
03:32:21.440 --> 03:32:23.500
<v Speaker 2>How much a month?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nine bucks.</v>

4517
03:32:23.540 --> 03:32:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Nine bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three $99 for CSO.</v>

4518
03:32:25.960 --> 03:32:29.360
<v Speaker 2>CSO is only going to be a sports one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be like $2.</v>

4519
03:32:29.720 --> 03:32:30.553
<v Speaker 2>Pretty soon you're going to be spending </v>
<v Speaker 2>$21 and you're going to get programming </v>

4520
03:32:34.041 --> 03:32:35.230
<v Speaker 2>from fucking Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4521
03:32:35.830 --> 03:32:37.610
<v Speaker 2>What does he have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's on it?</v>

4522
03:32:38.090 --> 03:32:41.660
<v Speaker 2>They have a small office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an NBC thing.</v>

4523
03:32:42.500 --> 03:32:44.630
<v Speaker 2>NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they've got everything.</v>

4524
03:32:44.650 --> 03:32:47.250
<v Speaker 2>NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was all 40 years Saturn,</v>

4525
03:32:47.260 --> 03:32:52.260
<v Speaker 2>live side that live and see all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess they will.</v>

4526
03:32:52.421 --> 03:32:53.660
<v Speaker 2>They're starting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4527
03:32:53.661 --> 03:32:55.850
<v Speaker 2>I guess they went after a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians.</v>

4528
03:32:55.851 --> 03:32:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Specials is already doing this thing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Seeso.</v>

4529
03:32:58.130 --> 03:32:58.963

<v Speaker 2>They have like original networking on </v>

4530
03:33:01.671 --> 03:33:03.500
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like original programming network.</v>

4531
03:33:03.501 --> 03:33:04.910
<v Speaker 2>You know what the fuck I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

4532
03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:07.370
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tremendous.</v>

4533
03:33:07.400 --> 03:33:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Well I think that's the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The future is those.</v>

4534
03:33:09.500 --> 03:33:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean like Netflix didn't become </v>
<v Speaker 2>netflix overnight.</v>

4535
03:33:11.750 --> 03:33:13.840
<v Speaker 2>There was something I was watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>online with.</v>

4536
03:33:13.841 --> 03:33:17.540
<v Speaker 2>This guy was talking about big companies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and companies to look for and you know,</v>

4537
03:33:17.541 --> 03:33:20.570
<v Speaker 2>it was companies like Google and apple </v>
<v Speaker 2>and big technology companies.</v>

4538
03:33:20.590 --> 03:33:23.630
<v Speaker 2>Anything that Netflix is going to be one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the next big technology companies.</v>

4539
03:33:23.631 --> 03:33:24.464
<v Speaker 2>You look at the growth and we'll get </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's worth now and what it's </v>

4540
03:33:26.121 --> 03:33:26.954
<v Speaker 2>projected to be worth like in 2020 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it just keeps growing and </v>

4541
03:33:29.991 --> 03:33:30.824
<v Speaker 2>growing and as more and more people </v>
<v Speaker 2>abandoned cable like less and less </v>

4542
03:33:34.101 --> 03:33:34.934
<v Speaker 2>people are getting cable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More and more people are getting their </v>

4543
03:33:36.681 --> 03:33:37.514
<v Speaker 2>TV from Netflix and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is the idea of watching </v>

4544
03:33:41.881 --> 03:33:44.520
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be home at 8:00</v>

4545
03:33:44.521 --> 03:33:45.780
<v Speaker 2>and going to be sitting there waiting.</v>

4546
03:33:45.960 --> 03:33:49.020
<v Speaker 2>It seems archaic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems archaic to wait for a show.</v>

4547
03:33:49.470 --> 03:33:53.340
<v Speaker 2>And what Netflix also does to get you in</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn you into a junkie is they.</v>

4548
03:33:53.341 --> 03:33:54.174
<v Speaker 2>You could just binge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could just sit there and watch all </v>

4549
03:33:56.131 --> 03:33:58.230
<v Speaker 2>the narcos episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just sit there.</v>

4550
03:33:58.650 --> 03:34:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll come home with a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't stand up to unwind the watching</v>

4551
03:34:02.910 --> 03:34:06.540
<v Speaker 2>an episode of fucking fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
