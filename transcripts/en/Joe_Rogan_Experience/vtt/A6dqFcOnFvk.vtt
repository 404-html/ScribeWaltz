00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.480
<v Speaker 1>You can converse in like an a type the type of English we're talking right now</v>

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.343
<v Speaker 1>almost,</v>

4
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.120
<v Speaker 1>which creates this weird tension between the things that you're discussing and</v>

5
00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:14.320
<v Speaker 1>how you're discussing them.</v>

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.581
<v Speaker 1>Like for instance,</v>

7
00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:20.581
<v Speaker 1>to have a guy just in conversational English talking about problems they're</v>

8
00:00:20.591 --> 00:00:25.240
<v Speaker 1>having with neighboring schamens and their own Sharman putting curses on each</v>

9
00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:26.770
<v Speaker 1>other and it like creates like,</v>

10
00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:30.880
<v Speaker 1>there's like a strange tension between like how it's being conveyed to you.</v>

11
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.553
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.341
<v Speaker 1>like how,</v>

13
00:00:33.341 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

14
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.283
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

15
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking conversational English,</v>

16
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I guess like a life,</v>

17
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.770
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like you'd want it to be when he's telling you this,</v>

18
00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:46.771
<v Speaker 1>you'd almost want to be reading it in like closed caption and he'd be saying it</v>

19
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:52.411
<v Speaker 1>in the indigenous language because it sounds weird to have to have an idea</v>

20
00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>that's so foreign to us,</v>

21
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.530
<v Speaker 1>which would be like a battle of schamens battling over access to wild animals.</v>

22
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.693
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>to have that delivered in conversational English has struck me as unusual.</v>

25
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.210
<v Speaker 1>And because like usually when you're traveling,</v>

26
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.710
<v Speaker 1>you're getting all of your information like traveling and Bolivia,</v>

27
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.970
<v Speaker 1>a guy would tell a story and he'd tell a story in um,</v>

28
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Sim Shyanne no one was staying in that same Shan Chimani.</v>

29
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>He tells story in Chimani to a person who spoke Spanish.</v>

31
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.660
<v Speaker 1>The person who speaks Spanish would tell it to a person.</v>

32
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

33
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

34
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.033
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

35
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Chimani guy telling someone who speaks Chimani in Spanish.</v>

36
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Then that person telling it to a person who speaks Spanish and English and then</v>

37
00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 1>that person giving you the information.</v>

38
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.040
<v Speaker 1>When you get it through that it takes on a mystical quality.</v>

39
00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Like you're crossing some space time thing,</v>

40
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

41
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Where you're seeing like these ideas discussed in their ancestral tongue.</v>

42
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

43
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Tamara sent you a video of a guy talking about killing a Jaguar.</v>

45
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

46
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

47
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.110
<v Speaker 1>The language you've never like when he's speaking you're like,</v>

48
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I've never in all my travels,</v>

49
00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of language.</v>

50
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 1>It sounds anything like that</v>

51
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.040
<v Speaker 2>right here.</v>

52
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to leave.</v>

54
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 2>You can use a Kombucha bottle.</v>

55
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

56
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:13.471
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's the healthiest for all of the PD.</v>

58
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 2>You've done this twice.</v>

59
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

60
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

61

<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

63
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.700
<v Speaker 2>I liked the fact that you're willing to do that too.</v>

64
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we could show it on youtube though,</v>

65
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:23.754
<v Speaker 2>so we'll have to,</v>

<v Speaker 2>There was only one solution.</v>

126
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 2>I almost went to the kitchen sink and then I put it like,</v>

127
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.450
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

128
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 2>Then we'd have to rinse that out.</v>

129
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 2>That shit would be nasty there.</v>

00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 2>That bathroom sick as nasty.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it looks like a bachelor.</v>

135
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.160
<v Speaker 2>We're on our way out of the spot.</v>

136
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.573
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's not that bad.</v>

149
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.620
<v Speaker 3>he said he wanted to talk about it during the hearings cause that's a big</v>

150
00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:14.070
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>

151
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.170
<v Speaker 3>But apparently they wouldn't let them go.</v>

152
00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:16.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

153
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.690
<v Speaker 3>Collusion between me and Comi would have fucked things up.</v>

154
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.650
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it's called?</v>

155
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

156
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.653
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

157
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.531
<v Speaker 3>well I actually,</v>

158
00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 3>it's funny cause this guy,</v>

159
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.781
<v Speaker 3>cause there's,</v>

160
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:28.290
<v Speaker 3>they say there's a chance which looking less like there's this guy Luke combs</v>

161
00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:30.450
<v Speaker 3>who's like my arch nemesis even though he's a good dude.</v>

162
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

163
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.370
<v Speaker 3>he was up against me this week on the country charts cause my album comes out,</v>

164
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.590
<v Speaker 3>my new album came out this week and I'm trying to beat him.</v>

165
00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:42.591
<v Speaker 3>And I said on Twitter that Russians have colluded with Sony records to like have</v>

166
00:04:42.931 --> 00:04:44.790
<v Speaker 3>him outsell me and he kind of played along.</v>

167
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:45.624
<v Speaker 3>So we'll see.</v>

168
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.051
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

169
00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:46.321
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

170
00:04:46.321 --> 00:04:47.131
<v Speaker 3>I think they are,</v>

171
00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:49.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean Nashville is definitely trying to keep me down,</v>

172
00:04:49.551 --> 00:04:50.130
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

173
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.760
<v Speaker 2>are they really,</v>

174
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.481
<v Speaker 2>are they fucking with you?</v>

175
00:04:51.481 --> 00:04:51.960
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>

176
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.400
<v Speaker 2>how were they receiving you now?</v>

177
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Now that you've become a mainstream success?</v>

178
00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Cause I hear about you all the time.</v>

179
00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Donald Cowboy Cerrone,</v>

180
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.490
<v Speaker 2>I think you know that he listens to your music before he goes out and fights.</v>

181
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.711
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

207
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.170
<v Speaker 3>rehearsing with Michael Madsen and you know,</v>

208
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.700
<v Speaker 3>it gets to the sucking Dick Parker.</v>

209
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.823
<v Speaker 3>I think he was just like,</v>

210
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.100
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck we sing in here?</v>

211
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.120
<v Speaker 2>So it's just the,</v>

212
00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:45.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

213
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 2>it's the threat of losing everything in moderation.</v>

214
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

215
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Being ostracized by and just sort of expelled into this world that you believe</v>

216
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 2>and have always believed is as evil and without</v>

217
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.083
<v Speaker 4>hope and doomed.</v>

218
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 4>So how did you do it?</v>

219
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.860
<v Speaker 4>How did your,</v>

220
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

221
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 4>you got all your stuff packed.</v>

222
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:04.050
<v Speaker 4>People are coming in,</v>

223
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 4>they're saying,</v>

224
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.971
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

225
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:05.631
<v Speaker 4>I mean like they're,</v>

226
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:05.901
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

227
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to convince us,</v>

228
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 4>but once they understand that we're not being convinced that,</v>

229
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

230
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

231
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

232
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 4>they walked away.</v>

233
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 4>So I mean that night our dad dropped us off at a hotel and then Jesus Christ.</v>

234
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

235
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.760
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>

236
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

237
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 4>it's so immediate that you become this,</v>

238
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 4>you become other,</v>

239
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 4>you become an outsider.</v>

240
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 4>Like in the next morning when we went back,</v>

241
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 4>I rang the doorbell,</v>

242
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 4>I rang the doorbell and I lived in that house from the day I was born.</v>

243
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.903
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

244
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 4>Felt like you had to ring the doorbell.</v>

245
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 4>This is not my world anymore.</v>

246
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

247
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.001
<v Speaker 4>Chris was like,</v>

248
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 4>why don't you ring the doorbell?</v>

249
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 4>And it was like,</v>

250
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

251
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.653
<v Speaker 4>there's no other,</v>

252
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.580
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

253
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 4>there is nothing else.</v>

254
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.770
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>

255
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.730
<v Speaker 4>this is not our home.</v>

256
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 4>It says not so we go and,</v>

257
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:46.701
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

258
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 4>we're packing all of our things.</v>

259
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 4>It was just,</v>

260
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.060
<v Speaker 4>it was awful just to,</v>

261
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.240
<v Speaker 4>I had been in those four months,</v>

262
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:57.600
<v Speaker 4>I had been so terrified of not knowing what was coming like this.</v>

263
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 4>Imagine you're going to lose everyone in your life that they're just,</v>

264
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Speaker 4>you're just going to like,</v>

265
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to like how your parents met and fell in love or like your</v>

266
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:12.401
<v Speaker 4>grandparents and family recipes and photos and memories and what did the house,</v>

267
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm like taking photos and voice recordings and just all the time,</v>

268
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 4>like in every,</v>

269
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.231
<v Speaker 4>it was just,</v>

270
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:18.561
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

271
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:19.340
<v Speaker 4>it's overwhelming.</v>

272
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.173
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

273
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.163
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

274
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 5>it may be at least understand that the source of my dissatisfaction in life</v>

275
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 5>wasn't internal.</v>

276
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 5>It Wa it made sense.</v>

277
00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:34.481
<v Speaker 5>It was that I was having a healthy reaction to circumstances in society that,</v>

278
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 5>that humans were not adapted for.</v>

279
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.650
<v Speaker 5>And even that was enough to bring a kind of peace of mind for me.</v>

280
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:42.400
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

281
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.000
<v Speaker 5>I also very consciously and deliberately try to live in places where there is</v>

282
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 5>the possibility of,</v>

283
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:48.794
<v Speaker 5>of um,</v>

284
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

285
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 5>sort of close communal neighborhood.</v>

286
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 5>I live in a very poor neighborhood in New York City at which for some of the</v>

287
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:58.970
<v Speaker 5>hassles at least has the sort of rich fabric of human connection that you just</v>

288
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:00.140
<v Speaker 5>don't get in wealthy neighborhoods.</v>

289
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:01.220
<v Speaker 5>So you'd do it on purpose.</v>

290
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.263
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

291
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.100
<v Speaker 5>What would,</v>

292
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.250

306
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:17.750
<v Speaker 5>People are quite poor.</v>

307
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

310
00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:21.770
<v Speaker 5>everyone knows each other by sight and we look out for each other.</v>

311
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>

312
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

313
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.540
<v Speaker 5>during hurricane,</v>

314
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.591
<v Speaker 5>a hurricane,</v>

315
00:08:24.591 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 5>when hurricane sandy hit New York,</v>

316
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:27.291
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

317
00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the people that had young children had to leave because there was no</v>

318
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 5>light,</v>

319
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 5>there was no water.</v>

320
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.130
<v Speaker 5>The power was out right to half of Manhattan was completely dark.</v>

321
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:38.180
<v Speaker 5>It was really actually quite dangerous at night in the dark half a Manhattan</v>

322
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

323
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.391
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

324
00:08:39.391 --> 00:08:40.390
<v Speaker 5>where there was no streetlights.</v>

325
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.170
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

326
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

327
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.441
<v Speaker 5>so this building,</v>

328
00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 5>it's a tenement building that I live in with my wife and um,</v>

329
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.040
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of the people left and that they were worried about being robbed and</v>

330
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.161
<v Speaker 5>these are poor people,</v>

331
00:08:52.161 --> 00:08:52.480
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

332
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.960
<v Speaker 5>It is not a wealthy building at all,</v>

333
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 5>is quite,</v>

334
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.333
<v Speaker 5>quite poor building.</v>

335
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 5>And so they,</v>

336
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:56.831
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

337
00:08:56.831 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 5>they organized a guard shift.</v>

338
00:08:58.321 --> 00:08:59.131
<v Speaker 5>One of the people,</v>

339
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 5>one of the women in the building had a machete and they organized guard shifts</v>

340
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:04.350
<v Speaker 5>at the front door with a machete and the young,</v>

341
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 5>the young men in the building took turns like two hours at a time guarding the</v>

342
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:08.280
<v Speaker 5>building with a machete.</v>

343
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.233
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

344
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.170
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

345
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:10.891
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

346
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't associated with the building at that time,</v>

347
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 5>but boy would that have made me feel good to be part of that.</v>

348
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

349
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:17.491
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

350
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 5>Like that is what human beings,</v>

351
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 5>that's what they are.</v>

352
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:20.340
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

353
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Speaker 5>It's that right.</v>

354
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:21.910
<v Speaker 5>And you,</v>

355
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 5>you didn't see that in a wealthy neighborhood,</v>

356
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.420
<v Speaker 5>partly because the wealthy neighborhoods actually had light.</v>

357
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.553
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

358
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
