<v Speaker 1>club down the street.</v>

71
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>We had to bring some dudes came to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They wanted eddy design.</v>

73

<v Speaker 1>they wanted a eddie the science books,</v>

74
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.420

<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

75
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.620
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we went to a waffle house and </v>

76
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.620
<v Speaker 1>fucked up some waffles.</v>

79
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:40.471
<v Speaker 1>cannabis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's legal.</v>

80
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

81
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>You know about that man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the marinol.</v>

82
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

83
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a synthetic cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

84
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>you know how they had that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>when the whole balco scandal came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was,</v>

86
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>was a steroid that they had made.</v>

87
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>It was just slightly different from </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular steroids in was undetectable and</v>

88
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>tests because the regular steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they were looking for in the test,</v>

89
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>they weren't looking for this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the same thing with this.</v>

90
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:07.231
<v Speaker 1>There's a synthetic cannabis that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could smoke it as the same effects and </v>

91
00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't show up in tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it look like?</v>

92
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>It looks like wheat and actually it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like.</v>

93
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

94
00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>it looks like not a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>And they just wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've just grown it and I mean,</v>

96
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've figured out a way to um,</v>

97
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about the botanists have </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way a long time ago to put</v>

98
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 1>thc into other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like,</v>

99
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:31.831
<v Speaker 1>there was an article online where there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was this guy was trying to put the </v>

100
00:04:31.831 --> 00:04:31.980
<v Speaker 1>tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get tomatoes to grow tac,</v>

101
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 1>like they can fuck with plants and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

102
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.320
<v Speaker 1>different plants produce more vitamin C </v>
<v Speaker 1>and different plants do certain things </v>

104
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.320
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

105
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to figure out how to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

106
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they have figured out how to,</v>

107
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 1>how to make we'd.</v>

108
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't show up in drug tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty crazy.</v>

109
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if you worked for ups or </v>

110
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 1>something like that and they drug test </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you can't smoke weed,</v>

111
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.050
<v Speaker 1>you can smoke the fuck out of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That is the weakest shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fake weed and they sell that is so </v>

120
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they say that that's like a big part</v>

121
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:28.831
<v Speaker 1>of their advertising revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just because they're </v>

122
00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:28.831
<v Speaker 1>fucking lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

123
00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:30.440
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me that everyone's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of we.</v>

124
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>They can't advertise their products and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your magazine come on,</v>

125
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.910
<v Speaker 1>but yet you can sell fake weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just ripping people off.</v>

126
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>That's all that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff doesn't get anyone high.</v>

127
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 1>But this other stuff does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sort of stuff is real.</v>

128
00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Roswell Museum and he actually saw a Ufo</v>
<v Speaker 1>and took photos of it and shit.</v>

134
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty crazy.</v>

142
00:06:29.861 --> 00:06:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like you would,</v>

143
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.050
<v Speaker 1>but you do</v>

144

<v Speaker 1>Prison wives of the Discovery Channel?</v>

149
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.780
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a show about chicks whose </v>

150
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.870
<v Speaker 1>husbands are in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

151
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I might have to see what channel </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery channel.</v>

152
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>It might be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

153
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 1>the history channel documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what I saw.</v>

154
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that one too.</v>

155
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 1>That was kind of interesting.</v>

156
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.440
<v Speaker 2>That was the best documentary I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen on your first.</v>

157
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

158
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 2>I know what I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have.</v>

159
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.240
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those rare documentaries </v>
<v Speaker 2>that let you have those two.</v>

160
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other side,</v>

161
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have a guy going,</v>

162
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 2>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all just mythology and you know,</v>

163
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:26.111
<v Speaker 2>it's in their minds and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy and why are they landing in Idaho </v>

164
00:07:26.111 --> 00:07:26.720
<v Speaker 2>all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not in big cities?</v>

165
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:31.721
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't have any of those guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was so ridiculous because </v>

166
00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:34.631
<v Speaker 2>that's so many high ranking military </v>
<v Speaker 2>officers coming forward that one case in</v>

167
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:40.721
<v Speaker 2>England on a US base with that 80 </v>
<v Speaker 2>witnesses and three of the guys went up </v>

168
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:46.661
<v Speaker 2>to it and touched it and wrote down </v>
<v Speaker 2>notes on it and they all came up in the </v>

169
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Ministry of Defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

170
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.850
<v Speaker 2>They said this is not a concern of </v>
<v Speaker 2>national defense.</v>

171
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the content.</v>

172
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.620
<v Speaker 2>So that is that alone right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty crazy.</v>

173
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.310
<v Speaker 2>And those Arizona Arizona Lights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people saying there's,</v>

174
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many witnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

175
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:12.130
<v Speaker 1>the Arizona life's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a dude who lives in Arizona saw </v>

176
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:12.130
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he saw the fucking,</v>

177
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 1>the big pyramid thing flying through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air and they sang.</v>

178
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:20.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like bigger than a aircraft carrier</v>
<v Speaker 1>football field.</v>

179
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.670
<v Speaker 1>He said it was gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said it was a gigantic,</v>

180
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:25.600
<v Speaker 1>big pyramid shaped thing flying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotland.</v>

181
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.130
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my take on Ufo.</v>

183
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been really were aliens that </v>

184
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.741
<v Speaker 1>could come here from another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that there will be so </v>

185
00:08:35.741 --> 00:08:37.340
<v Speaker 1>silly that they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't disguise themselves.</v>

186
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the shit we see all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time could be Ufo as I told you about </v>

187
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.630
<v Speaker 1>that crazy dude that told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

188
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.700
<v Speaker 1>he was showing me pictures of clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a dude that I know is a </v>

189
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.230
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very nice guy and uh,</v>

190
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.350
<v Speaker 1>the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

191
00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to him at the Improv and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeboy says,</v>

192
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.030
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about Ufo?</v>

193
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.910
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

194
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

195
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

196
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't discount the idea.</v>

197
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:07.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we have spaceships and for </v>

198
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.070
<v Speaker 1>someone from other planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're more intelligent than us,</v>

199
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:13.071
<v Speaker 1>for sure they could have space ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he starts pulling on his iphone and </v>

200
00:09:13.071 --> 00:09:16.650
<v Speaker 1>the dude has like dozens of pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>clouds on his phone.</v>

201
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.120
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

202
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.690
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that,</v>

203
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get this right there,</v>

204
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.440
<v Speaker 1>and I go to cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

205
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:24.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an unusually shaped cloud.</v>

206
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

207
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's crazy.</v>

208
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking crazy.</v>

209
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 1>This dude takes pictures of clouds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all different clouds.</v>

210
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:35.570
<v Speaker 1>And he's convinced that these clouds are</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ufos.</v>

211
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:41.650
<v Speaker 1>But at one point on one hand you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to think like if you really are so </v>

212
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>superintelligent that you can visit from</v>
<v Speaker 1>other planets,</v>

213
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.150
<v Speaker 1>why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 1>for sure we're working on cloaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>devices right now.</v>

215
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 1>There is already this Japanese jacket </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been invented that basically </v>

216
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.780
<v Speaker 1>takes an image of what's behind you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>broadcast it on the front of the jacket.</v>

217
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:03.020
<v Speaker 1>It's basically like Predator type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember from the movie the </v>

218
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they really have this already.</v>

219
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not perfected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't travel to other planets yet</v>

220
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:08.970
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

221
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:14.030
<v Speaker 1>So if someone from another planet is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more highly intelligent than we </v>

222
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.841
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can actually travel here from </v>

223
00:10:17.841 --> 00:10:18.780
<v Speaker 1>other galaxies are or older other solar </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems for sure.</v>

224
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 1>They've figured something like this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're seeing the sky,</v>

225
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very possible,</v>

226
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.480
<v Speaker 1>you know that what you're seeing is if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there are Ufo as you would see an </v>

227
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.170
<v Speaker 1>image of the sky behind the behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFL being projected onto you.</v>

228
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.770
<v Speaker 1>So you wouldn't see shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

229
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.800
<v Speaker 1>that said you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could take into account how many </v>

230
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Ufos are reported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

231
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's some ridiculous amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

232
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.580
<v Speaker 1>of Ufo is reported and if you take into </v>
<v Speaker 1>account how many people see and don't </v>

233
00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:51.621
<v Speaker 1>report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't say anything because they </v>

234
00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:51.621
<v Speaker 1>want to look foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

235
00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:51.621
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of Goddamn Ufo.</v>

236
00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:56.130
<v Speaker 1>False.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of what people are seeing </v>

237
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:56.220
<v Speaker 1>is military jets that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

238
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

239
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:02.630
<v Speaker 1>we did fear factor down near Edwards air</v>
<v Speaker 1>force base and they had stealth bombers </v>

240
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.630
<v Speaker 1>flew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

241
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.190
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a stealth bomber.</v>

242
00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 1>You think that's a goddamn space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>

243
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the French government did a test with </v>

244
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:11.740
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a serious,</v>

245
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.500
<v Speaker 2>a review of all the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like 50,000</v>

246
00:11:15.501 --> 00:11:17.690
<v Speaker 2>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something 50,000</v>

247
00:11:17.691 --> 00:11:20.780
<v Speaker 2>since certain year there's probably way </v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

248
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.080
<v Speaker 2>but they came to the conclusion that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>95 percent of reported cases can be </v>

249
00:11:28.401 --> 00:11:30.550
<v Speaker 2>explained away with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like military others,</v>

250
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.660
<v Speaker 2>high ranking military or this top secret</v>
<v Speaker 2>military planes and different lights,</v>

251
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:40.780
<v Speaker 2>but they said five percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most likely our aircraft from other </v>

252
00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:42.470
<v Speaker 2>worlds.</v>

253
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they can say aircraft </v>

254
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:47.900
<v Speaker 1>from other worlds because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily think we have a.</v>

255
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.010
<v Speaker 1>it's more likely to take inventory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what exists in this moment.</v>

256
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 2>They're saying they're saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>

257
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.640
<v Speaker 1>probably what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More of.</v>

258
00:11:55.641 --> 00:11:59.090
<v Speaker 1>The more likely it's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraterrestrial craft then.</v>

259
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean they got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's five percent of it.</v>

260
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:06.121
<v Speaker 1>Just because it's not from our </v>
<v Speaker 1>government or the Russian government </v>

261
00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:07.650
<v Speaker 1>doesn't necessarily mean even as from </v>
<v Speaker 1>another planet.</v>

262
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.120
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the fuck is in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>

263
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

264
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.640
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of Ufo is get cited.</v>

265
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a whole a history channel </v>

266
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:18.130
<v Speaker 1>documentary about that and people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

267
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.240
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nonsense.</v>

268
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:24.241
<v Speaker 1>That's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's silly that you can set a fucking </v>

269
00:12:24.241 --> 00:12:26.490
<v Speaker 1>picture that you could take this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and send a video across the sky </v>

270
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:32.161
<v Speaker 1>into somebody else's phone in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's way more silly than some people </v>

271
00:12:32.161 --> 00:12:36.421
<v Speaker 1>from another planet have visited here or</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's something living in the </v>

272
00:12:36.421 --> 00:12:36.421
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>

273
00:12:36.421 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 2>especially when you have guys like x </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pentagon,</v>

274
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 2>high ranking officials like Philip </v>
<v Speaker 2>Corso,</v>

275
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.000
<v Speaker 2>who before he died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a book and he explained his job</v>

276
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.500
<v Speaker 2>in the government in the Pentagon was </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking crashed ufo stuff,</v>

277
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.740
<v Speaker 2>taking it to like a Hughes aircraft and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lockheed and all these different </v>

278
00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.750
<v Speaker 2>aerospace companies to reverse engineer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's saying he was like,</v>

279
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.470
<v Speaker 2>there's many interviews on youtube with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Philip course.</v>

280
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.250
<v Speaker 2>He's dead now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on dateline and they try to like,</v>

281
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:07.990
<v Speaker 2>ridicule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

282
00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:08.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you.</v>

283
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.500
<v Speaker 1>J Dot Allen Hynek too is another </v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent example that jail.</v>

284
00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:16.501
<v Speaker 1>And Hank was the guy who was in charge </v>
<v Speaker 1>of project blue book and he was told to </v>

285
00:13:16.501 --> 00:13:18.670
<v Speaker 1>by the government when they had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to explain away everything,</v>

286
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:20.440
<v Speaker 1>swamp gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

287
00:13:20.441 --> 00:13:25.441
<v Speaker 1>a mass hysteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything they could do to explain away </v>

288
00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:28.860
<v Speaker 1>ufo cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as he became more involved in </v>

289
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.890
<v Speaker 1>project blue book and as he investigated</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more sightings and you know,</v>

290
00:13:30.891 --> 00:13:35.891
<v Speaker 1>and dealt with more and more evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he became absolutely convinced that you </v>

291
00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:35.891
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were real.</v>

292
00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:37.570
<v Speaker 1>So Jay Allen Hynek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>

293
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy actually working to discredit ufo </v>

294
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.270
<v Speaker 1>eventually came out and started a </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting the whole Ufo movement.</v>

295
00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:48.130
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

296
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:50.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not ridiculous to think that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been visited.</v>

297
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean we go to the Congo all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stare at chimpanzees,</v>

298
00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:58.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you were from another planet </v>

299
00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:58.390
<v Speaker 1>and you had the ability to travel here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you check out people?</v>

300
00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.980
<v Speaker 1>People are fucking completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

301
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 1>They're probably fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

302
00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:04.840
<v Speaker 1>what would be more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We studied lower forms of animals.</v>

303
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:09.841
<v Speaker 1>We always have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have been doing this since the </v>

304
00:14:09.841 --> 00:14:09.841
<v Speaker 1>beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

305
00:14:09.841 --> 00:14:13.591
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have always been interested in </v>

306
00:14:13.591 --> 00:14:16.350
<v Speaker 1>botany and we've always been interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in studying different monkeys and in </v>

307
00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:21.631
<v Speaker 1>different weird animals and other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the whole thing with </v>

308
00:14:21.631 --> 00:14:21.631
<v Speaker 1>Darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:14:21.631 --> 00:14:21.631
<v Speaker 1>he took a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.840
<v Speaker 1>it took a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an account of all these different </v>

311
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.461
<v Speaker 1>animals that he came across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've always done shit like that and I </v>

312
00:14:29.461 --> 00:14:31.480
<v Speaker 1>think if we were a much higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence than human beings,</v>

313
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.970
<v Speaker 1>we would want to do that with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would want to check out and see what the</v>

314
00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:37.030
<v Speaker 1>fuck people are up to see if people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolving,</v>

315
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.040
<v Speaker 1>see what the bottleneck is as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>like social and cultural evolution and </v>

316
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.411
<v Speaker 1>see what the bottleneck is as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological evolution and whether or </v>

317
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:50.101
<v Speaker 1>not our technology is surpassing our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ability as a human being like too to</v>

318
00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 1>make rational decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it probably is right now.</v>

319
00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just fired up the large Hadron </v>

320
00:14:59.940 --> 00:14:59.940
<v Speaker 1>collider yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

321
00:14:59.940 --> 00:14:59.960

<v Speaker 1>It's all nonsense.</v>

344
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.950
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think religion is awesome if you do it</v>

349
00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:28.980
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do it right,</v>

350
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.590
<v Speaker 2>if you do the right thing and help your </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbors.</v>

351
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Like my grandma was hardcore Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wouldn't try to convince her like </v>

352
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.590
<v Speaker 2>if she was still allowed to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

353
00:16:37.591 --> 00:16:42.591
<v Speaker 2>she was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was going to church every day and </v>

354
00:16:42.591 --> 00:16:43.050
<v Speaker 2>that praying is like meditating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was meditating.</v>

355
00:16:43.051 --> 00:16:46.380
<v Speaker 2>So I think just like having the healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart.</v>

356
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.240
<v Speaker 2>You could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people can do kettlebells,</v>

357
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.850
<v Speaker 2>some people could run on a treadmill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people run stairs,</v>

358
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:55.940
<v Speaker 2>some people do martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for a healthy heart and it all </v>

359
00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.070
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think religion,</v>

360
00:16:56.071 --> 00:17:01.071
<v Speaker 2>whether you're doing the Jesus or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ally or the Buddha or meditation or </v>

361
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:02.310
<v Speaker 2>yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really matter.</v>

362
00:17:02.311 --> 00:17:06.570
<v Speaker 2>As long as you get your frequency at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right spot with the universe.</v>

363
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.370
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if you do the Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

364
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.530
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that.</v>

365
00:17:10.531 --> 00:17:12.870
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think whatever you,</v>

366
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.940
<v Speaker 2>whatever it gets you in that right </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequency,</v>

367
00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:19.500
<v Speaker 2>you can worship your iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you actually believe that and you can</v>

368
00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:22.590
<v Speaker 2>meditate to your iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the universe don't give a fuck.</v>

369
00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:27.620
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to get to our </v>

370
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:27.620
<v Speaker 2>frequency?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all that.</v>

371
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.260
<v Speaker 2>My real problem is people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is the same.</v>

372
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing when whenever,</v>

373
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.240
<v Speaker 2>when someone believes in something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they believe in something </v>

374
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.641
<v Speaker 2>completely irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want everyone else to believe in </v>

375
00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:38.820
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to everyone else to be on their team.</v>

376
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:43.970
<v Speaker 2>That's why like if you ever talked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that use windows and they find </v>

377
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:44.160
<v Speaker 2>out that you use Mac and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck man,</v>

378
00:17:44.161 --> 00:17:49.161
<v Speaker 2>I use Mac for faggots and then he crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they want you to use windows and </v>

379
00:17:49.161 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>it's like want you to be</v>

380
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Muslim?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want you to be a scientologist.</v>

381
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.630
<v Speaker 1>They want you to be a Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

382
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 1>that's the real problem is that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>want you to,</v>

383
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:57.770
<v Speaker 1>to</v>

384
00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:58.190
<v Speaker 4>two</v>

385
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.380
<v Speaker 1>subscribed to their ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea behind it,</v>

386
00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:04.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a better person and you know,</v>

387
00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.290
<v Speaker 1>and treating everybody as if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you know that all that,</v>

388
00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.730
<v Speaker 1>that's the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

389
00:18:09.731 --> 00:18:14.731
<v Speaker 1>it really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fucking handing out the basket </v>

390
00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:14.731
<v Speaker 1>and fucking kids and all that other shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

391
00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:16.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in relationships with kids.</v>

392
00:18:16.781 --> 00:18:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I have to admit I'm not into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm against that.</v>

393
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I saw that deliver us from evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They recommended.</v>

394
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's called deliver us from evil.</v>

396
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.090
<v Speaker 1>If you want to find out how fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Catholic Church really is.</v>

397
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this incredible?</v>

398
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

399
00:18:34.631 --> 00:18:39.631
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't watch the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched about an hour and 10 </v>

400
00:18:39.631 --> 00:18:42.331
<v Speaker 1>minutes to get to the point where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out that guy's done like hundreds </v>

401
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:42.331
<v Speaker 1>of kids.</v>

402
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't take it.</v>

403
00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

404
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

405
00:18:45.741 --> 00:18:50.741
<v Speaker 1>it's really a really sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick documentary about this priest who </v>

406
00:18:50.741 --> 00:18:54.800
<v Speaker 1>is responsible for molesting hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids and you know,</v>

407
00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.690
<v Speaker 1>they covered it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kept moving on,</v>

408
00:18:56.691 --> 00:18:58.860
<v Speaker 1>they moved them all over the country and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

409
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.790
<v Speaker 1>really it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's going on right now.</v>

410
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.060
<v Speaker 1>That gigantic scandal that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now with the pope.</v>

411
00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.510
<v Speaker 1>The pope had knowledge of all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking shit that was going on.</v>

412
00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.830
<v Speaker 1>There's so many pedophiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all pedophiles.</v>

413
00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 1>I bet they're all pedophiles because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just because it was,</v>

414
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:22.670
<v Speaker 1>if it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was half of them or a quarter </v>

415
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:23.140
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be busting each other out.</v>

416
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.280
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be people coming forward </v>

417
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:28.280
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to stop this shit.</v>

418
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.890
<v Speaker 1>They're all covering each other's asses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

419
00:19:29.891 --> 00:19:34.891
<v Speaker 1>think about it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They chose a job where they can get any </v>

420
00:19:34.891 --> 00:19:34.891
<v Speaker 1>pussy.</v>

421
00:19:34.891 --> 00:19:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea,</v>

422
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.650
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's got to drive you insane.</v>

423
00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:42.660
<v Speaker 1>And anybody who accepts a job where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get laid that you gotta be fucked up</v>

424
00:19:43.371 --> 00:19:44.570
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You already got.</v>

425
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.870
<v Speaker 1>And I think my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my theory is that when these guys grow </v>

426
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:50.030
<v Speaker 1>up gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're relieved,</v>

427
00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.130
<v Speaker 1>they're grown up in a religious home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>

428
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.050
<v Speaker 1>And then once they find out they're gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realize,</v>

429
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe Satan is inside of me.</v>

430
00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.860
<v Speaker 1>I got these gay feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

431
00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I gotta fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same.</v>

432
00:19:58.921 --> 00:20:01.640
<v Speaker 1>So they become ultra religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultra Catholic,</v>

433
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.790
<v Speaker 1>and then they're trying to prove to God </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to fight the gay.</v>

434
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.900
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna devote their life to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become a priest and then Bam,</v>

435
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.990
<v Speaker 1>they hold it together for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they lose it.</v>

436
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.700
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen that video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God hates fags.</v>

437
00:20:13.701 --> 00:20:14.780
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who,</v>

438
00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:19.781
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a gay guy who was singing about </v>

439
00:20:19.781 --> 00:20:19.781
<v Speaker 1>being Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen that going to sign that shit.</v>

440
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.320
<v Speaker 1>You know what I gotta get the fuck out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of here.</v>

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.380

<v Speaker 1>We don't have to leave for 20 minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We leave the shower stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

443
00:20:25.731 --> 00:20:27.980
<v Speaker 1>But the fights don't even start for more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than hour.</v>

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.150
<v Speaker 4>This is a real fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry man.</v>

466
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:21.370
<v Speaker 4>This is so real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christian guy came in through the five </v>

467
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:49.460
<v Speaker 4>senses that we have is it's just not put</v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

468
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.700
<v Speaker 4>You've got to go find and put all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>parts together,</v>

469
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.200
<v Speaker 4>but the world has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's fucking mustache.</v>

472
00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.270
<v Speaker 5>To be a gay dude and be religious and to</v>
<v Speaker 5>think that God hates you.</v>

473
00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:57.650
<v Speaker 5>You can always be afraid if you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 5>seen that video,</v>

474
00:23:57.651 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 5>you got to watch it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely ridiculous and by the way,</v>

475
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:03.480
<v Speaker 5>totally real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know the fucking dude is a,</v>

476
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.380
<v Speaker 5>is a gay guy who converted to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christianity and he's like,</v>

477
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>try to tell people the right way to go.</v>

478
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

479
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.760
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty awesome stuff.</v>

480
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.110

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as get lighter considered.</v>

483
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:25.800

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

484

<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

485
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Tim and Eric Rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably top three favorite </v>

486
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:31.190
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not In celebrity rehab.</v>

487
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.840
<v Speaker 5>That fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A dance floor.</v>

488
00:24:34.841 --> 00:24:36.640
<v Speaker 5>Dale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you haven't seen that,</v>

489
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:41.910
<v Speaker 5>go do a google search for dance floor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dale is got to be one of the funniest </v>

490
00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.180
<v Speaker 5>fucking videos I've ever seen in my </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

491
00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:46.060
<v Speaker 5>The weirdest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>funniest things on the Internet ever.</v>

492
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:47.680
<v Speaker 5>Dance floor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dale,</v>

493
00:24:47.681 --> 00:24:49.000
<v Speaker 5>you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See this gotTa,</v>

494
00:24:49.001 --> 00:24:50.050
<v Speaker 5>find it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>find it.</v>

495
00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:51.250
<v Speaker 5>It's online,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's on my website.</v>

496
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.840
<v Speaker 5>You can find it on Joe Rogan.net</v>

497
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:58.120
<v Speaker 2>season three of 10 minute Erica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they keep having recurring </v>

498
00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.680
<v Speaker 2>sketches and they just get funnier and </v>
<v Speaker 2>funnier the more the more developed.</v>

499
00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:06.940
<v Speaker 5>Here's a good question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does Damien Maia and his Jujitsu </v>

500
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.911
<v Speaker 5>bring to the table that latest didn't?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Versus Silva because Damien Maia is </v>

501
00:25:09.911 --> 00:25:11.810
<v Speaker 5>fighting Anderson Silva next month and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Abu Dhabi next week.</v>

502
00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:13.760
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a dummy next week.</v>

503
00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:18.860
<v Speaker 2>I think Damien Maia is a better guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poorer the Talus does talus would pull </v>

504
00:25:18.871 --> 00:25:20.430
<v Speaker 2>guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he wouldn't clench up first.</v>

505
00:25:20.431 --> 00:25:22.160
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filter doesn't.</v>

506
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:27.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to just fall in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to really shoot deep with an </v>

507
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.060
<v Speaker 2>under hook and you've got to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy sprawl and if he doesn't sprawl,</v>

508
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you didn't take a deep shot,</v>

509
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.800
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to pull them into your </v>
<v Speaker 2>garden.</v>

510
00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.140
<v Speaker 2>David Maya likes to shoot deep and pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>guard.</v>

511
00:25:37.141 --> 00:25:42.141
<v Speaker 2>I think that'll be the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way he's going to stand with </v>

512
00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:42.141
<v Speaker 2>Anderson Silva,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

513
00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:46.340
<v Speaker 2>just based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just based on Anderson Silva's </v>

514
00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.161
<v Speaker 2>career and what he's done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but based on his last fight where he </v>

515
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:51.390
<v Speaker 2>tried to stand for a little bit with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nate Marquardt and he,</v>

516
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.420
<v Speaker 2>he's going to pull guard immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

517
00:25:53.421 --> 00:25:55.030
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to fuck around anymore.</v>

518
00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.650
<v Speaker 5>That shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope that's true,</v>

519
00:25:56.651 --> 00:25:58.780
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't think he was going to try </v>
<v Speaker 5>to stand with nate either.</v>

520
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stood with them for one punch and </v>

521
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:04.330
<v Speaker 2>that was just one punch too long and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to.</v>

522
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.610
<v Speaker 5>He's training with vandelay and vandelay</v>
<v Speaker 5>brawler,</v>

523
00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:07.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think that,</v>

524
00:26:07.861 --> 00:26:12.861
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that style of getting in there and just </v>

525
00:26:12.861 --> 00:26:12.861
<v Speaker 5>mixing it up and get ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just not,</v>

526
00:26:12.861 --> 00:26:17.700
<v Speaker 5>it's not a good style for a guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>not very technically proficient </v>

527
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:17.700
<v Speaker 5>instruction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>striking,</v>

528
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just so good on the ground.</v>

529
00:26:19.821 --> 00:26:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Why give your opponent any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance,</v>

530
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:29.050
<v Speaker 2>especially Anderson Silva,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to try and mix it up </v>

531
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:29.050
<v Speaker 2>a little bit with them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big fucking mistake.</v>

532
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:29.780
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna.</v>

533
00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Pull guard immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me or try to take them down </v>

534
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:34.960
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

535
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Anderson Silva isn't some NCAA national </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion or anything,</v>

536
00:26:37.581 --> 00:26:40.910
<v Speaker 2>so I'm sure Damien Maia is really going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take a shot for real,</v>

537
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.200
<v Speaker 2>for real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to take them down.</v>

538
00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:44.700
<v Speaker 2>But if he has any trouble he will pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>guard.</v>

539
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.740
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee that.</v>

540
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've definitely seen Anderson been </v>

541
00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:52.860
<v Speaker 1>taken down before it got taken down many</v>
<v Speaker 1>times by um,</v>

542
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:58.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>travis luder now Travis Luder probably </v>

543
00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:58.210
<v Speaker 1>had the most success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you gotta think about that fight.</v>

544
00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:03.071
<v Speaker 1>Travis luder fought Anderson 11 weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>after Anderson had knee surgery on both </v>

545
00:27:03.071 --> 00:27:07.601
<v Speaker 1>knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that probably wasn't the best </v>

546
00:27:07.601 --> 00:27:07.601
<v Speaker 1>representation of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

547
00:27:07.601 --> 00:27:11.650
<v Speaker 1>his wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Dan Henderson took them down as </v>

548
00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.411
<v Speaker 1>well and when Dan Henderson took him </v>
<v Speaker 1>down because he wasn't able to do </v>

549
00:27:14.411 --> 00:27:14.490
<v Speaker 1>anything to let me just kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>held them down on the ground,</v>

550
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.850
<v Speaker 1>punched him a few times but really </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get anything going.</v>

551
00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.380
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the big question is,</v>

552
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:23.330
<v Speaker 1>is Anderson's Jujitsu good enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stifle a Damien Maia?</v>

553
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Because Damien Meyer had a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Dan Miller and his last fight </v>

554
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.350
<v Speaker 1>really couldn't get anything going with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

555
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean he grounded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounded him and you know,</v>

556
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:35.200
<v Speaker 1>he'd beat them by decision but never </v>
<v Speaker 1>came close to finishing with a </v>

557
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:35.200
<v Speaker 1>submission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

558
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.520
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think Dan Miller is a real good,</v>

559
00:27:37.521 --> 00:27:42.521
<v Speaker 1>real tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think Anderson's Jujitsu is at </v>

560
00:27:42.521 --> 00:27:45.310
<v Speaker 1>least as good as millers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean on paper at least he's a black </v>

561
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:45.310
<v Speaker 1>belt</v>

562
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.760
<v Speaker 2>mothers of Rambo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Miller has wrestled his whole life.</v>

563
00:27:47.761 --> 00:27:52.761
<v Speaker 2>There's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a different kind of animal when </v>

564
00:27:52.761 --> 00:27:52.761
<v Speaker 2>you're grappling with a real legit </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler.</v>

565
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.920
<v Speaker 2>And Anderson Silva has long limbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like going with guys that have long </v>

566
00:27:58.111 --> 00:27:59.330
<v Speaker 2>arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

567
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Rubber guards a lot easier with taller </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

568
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.640
<v Speaker 2>It's harder for them to pull out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

569
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:10.140
<v Speaker 2>I have long arms like the small one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 short five foot five,</v>

570
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:15.230
<v Speaker 2>stocky wrestler types.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hard to get any rubber guard on </v>

571
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.230
<v Speaker 2>because they popped their arms out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

572
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out so easily.</v>

573
00:28:16.051 --> 00:28:17.910
<v Speaker 2>They're really small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

574
00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:20.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think David Maya is going to have more</v>

575
00:28:20.041 --> 00:28:22.500
<v Speaker 2>success with his Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

576
00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.290
<v Speaker 2>with Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he gets him to the ground then he did</v>

577
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:28.170
<v Speaker 2>with Miller because Miller again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's only a brown belt,</v>

578
00:28:28.171 --> 00:28:29.700
<v Speaker 2>but damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrestled his whole life.</v>

579
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:30.490
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

580
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.600
<v Speaker 2>that's a different kind of animal right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

581
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:34.500
<v Speaker 2>A chimpanzee</v>

582
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:39.030
<v Speaker 1>think about Anderson is that Anderson </v>
<v Speaker 1>has had elbow problems for years.</v>

583
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:44.300
<v Speaker 1>He's said a bone chunks floating around </v>
<v Speaker 1>his elbow that may training really </v>

584
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.441
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would have to ice his elbows after </v>

585
00:28:48.441 --> 00:28:51.411
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it couldn't do any weight </v>

586
00:28:51.411 --> 00:28:51.450
<v Speaker 1>lifting and strength and conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's elbows hurt.</v>

587
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.420
<v Speaker 1>He finally got all that shit fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got the elbow chunks,</v>

588
00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:59.540
<v Speaker 1>the piece of bone taken out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to see an Anderson Silva </v>

589
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.060
<v Speaker 1>that's in a better condition than we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen him in a long,</v>

590
00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:05.061
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's at a problem throwing his right </v>

591
00:29:05.061 --> 00:29:05.061
<v Speaker 1>hand because of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really hard to believe when you</v>

592
00:29:05.061 --> 00:29:09.351
<v Speaker 1>see his fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Country Nelson went tonight by fat </v>

593
00:29:10.141 --> 00:29:11.520
<v Speaker 1>mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>

594
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

595
00:29:12.811 --> 00:29:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big guy like Roy Nelson,</v>

596
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.880
<v Speaker 1>he that waits centralized in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>stomach.</v>

597
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.570
<v Speaker 1>He knows that a hold you with that shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can keep you in a certain position.</v>

598
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:23.760
<v Speaker 1>He's really good at keeping his weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>on you.</v>

599
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.260
<v Speaker 1>We have a dude that we trained with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brent grandkids inside control.</v>

600
00:29:28.261 --> 00:29:33.261
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that motherfucker is really hard to get </v>

601
00:29:33.261 --> 00:29:33.261
<v Speaker 1>off you and he's built similar to big </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

602
00:29:33.261 --> 00:29:36.000
<v Speaker 1>not as fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got a big gut and you know,</v>

603
00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 1>and he's talented as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a good Jujitsu guy and when he gets</v>

604
00:29:39.421 --> 00:29:41.830
<v Speaker 1>on top of you and you know he gets a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good position on you,</v>

605
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.040
<v Speaker 1>is really hard to shake them off you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plants that weight down on you and </v>

606
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.511
<v Speaker 1>holds you in place and big country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had to guess what's gonna Happen </v>

607
00:29:51.511 --> 00:29:51.511
<v Speaker 1>Tonight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's truth?</v>

608
00:29:51.511 --> 00:29:55.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that big contract he gets </v>

609
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:55.480
<v Speaker 1>them down to ground is going to be a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trouble.</v>

610
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

611
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But struve has a lot of potential.</v>

612
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.460
<v Speaker 2>He might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might be the underdog in this fight.</v>

613
00:30:02.461 --> 00:30:07.461
<v Speaker 2>He probably should be based on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience and is really young and </v>

614
00:30:07.461 --> 00:30:09.250
<v Speaker 2>country's been grappling for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's really good on the ground.</v>

615
00:30:09.251 --> 00:30:11.150
<v Speaker 2>People haven't really seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He likes to stand in back,</v>

616
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.630
<v Speaker 2>but country Nelson's really good on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

617
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:15.040
<v Speaker 2>Really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really good.</v>

618
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Frank Mir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it like 11?</v>

619
00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Nothing in a submission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

620
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really.</v>

621
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:22.840
<v Speaker 2>He's got a great half guard game too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just haven't really seen it.</v>

622
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:28.110
<v Speaker 2>But true in the long run has so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>

623
00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean that guy that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like 26,</v>

624
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:35.590
<v Speaker 2>eight or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's super tall and he loves Jujitsu.</v>

625
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:40.650
<v Speaker 2>You never see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never see tall guys like that who </v>

626
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:40.930
<v Speaker 2>were athletic and coordinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love Jujitsu.</v>

627
00:30:40.931 --> 00:30:42.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've seen 70 shell.</v>

628
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.720
<v Speaker 2>He didn't like Jiu Jitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

629
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:46.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what other tall guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

630
00:30:46.901 --> 00:30:51.901
<v Speaker 2>random ran a Kendall grove.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another tall guy who likes to </v>

631
00:30:51.901 --> 00:30:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Jitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was true if he continues to </v>

632
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:59.761
<v Speaker 2>evolve and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and remains a student of the game and </v>

633
00:30:59.761 --> 00:31:02.611
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course striking and wrestling as </v>

634
00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:02.611
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in Jujitsu,</v>

635
00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:05.880
<v Speaker 2>the way he's moving and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've talked several times about a </v>

636
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu and strategy and philosophies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff,</v>

637
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:10.030
<v Speaker 2>and he's on the right track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's that he,</v>

638
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.080
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

639
00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:16.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we can be country at </v>

640
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:16.140
<v Speaker 2>this point in his career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

641
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but get that guy another five,</v>

642
00:31:17.891 --> 00:31:18.910
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven years,</v>

643
00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:23.020
<v Speaker 2>if it continues to evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can be a serious threat with that.</v>

644
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Would that height his guard could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

645
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he decided to be a Ninja office </v>

646
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:32.600
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck is only 22.</v>

647
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing about that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's real young.</v>

648
00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:37.550
<v Speaker 1>He's got a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive amount of time ahead of him,</v>

649
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:39.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of potential.</v>

650
00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:44.041
<v Speaker 1>And he's got crazy heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember in Germany when you got cut </v>

651
00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:44.041
<v Speaker 1>wide open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was bleeding all over the place.</v>

652
00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:48.881
<v Speaker 1>And who did you fight that fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got in trouble and you got cut real </v>

653
00:31:49.701 --> 00:31:52.120
<v Speaker 1>bad and he still pulled it out and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of submitting the dudes.</v>

654
00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:54.410
<v Speaker 1>So it was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty bad ass.</v>

655
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Do another youth stream tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

656
00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we will get back to the hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be late here and I don't go to bed</v>

657
00:32:00.981 --> 00:32:03.650
<v Speaker 1>until late on the west coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it will be early for me.</v>

658
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:04.820
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do that.</v>

659
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:07.640
<v Speaker 1>We could come after the after party and </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

660
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.620
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Non Sober,</v>

661
00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:15.100
<v Speaker 1>sober version of the dream because I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go do the broadcast and right now go </v>

662
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.630
<v Speaker 1>me or Ken Flo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows sun?</v>

663
00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.840
<v Speaker 1>That's why they got to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's exciting having gotten me </v>

664
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:22.840
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have liked to see them over here</v>

665
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.630
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

666
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:28.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still young and he's got a lot to </v>

667
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:28.990
<v Speaker 1>prove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

668
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.090
<v Speaker 1>and I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's training real hard.</v>

669
00:32:29.091 --> 00:32:32.390
<v Speaker 1>He looked really in real good shape and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's saying all the right things that he</v>

670
00:32:32.391 --> 00:32:37.391
<v Speaker 1>wants to really make another run and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>another run at Bj Penn and he's </v>

671
00:32:37.391 --> 00:32:38.630
<v Speaker 1>obviously got to get through Tennessee </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

672
00:32:38.631 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 1>So I think going to be real interesting.</v>

673
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.680
<v Speaker 5>He's a solid wrestler and there's a big </v>
<v Speaker 5>power puncher,</v>

674
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:43.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he hits hard.</v>

675
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.860
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

676
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 5>I think Kenny's going to try to use his </v>
<v Speaker 5>legs.</v>

677
00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.900
<v Speaker 5>He Kenny's got real good leg kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>real good movement.</v>

678
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.330
<v Speaker 5>He's going gonna try to use his </v>
<v Speaker 5>footwork,</v>

679
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:56.390
<v Speaker 5>working with leg kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then if it goes to the ground,</v>

680
00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:58.310
<v Speaker 5>who tried to submit them and cut them up</v>
<v Speaker 5>with elbows.</v>

681
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:03.460
<v Speaker 5>The thing about Gomez Gomez has not </v>
<v Speaker 5>fought anybody ever with the elbow </v>

682
00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 5>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

683
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:06.410
<v Speaker 5>elbows are different man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially the cage,</v>

684
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cage and elbows,</v>

685
00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:13.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are two totally different things </v>

686
00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.821
<v Speaker 5>that he's never experienced before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's going to be going to be </v>

687
00:33:15.821 --> 00:33:15.821
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'll be interesting.</v>

688
00:33:15.821 --> 00:33:15.821
<v Speaker 5>And Kenny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

689
00:33:15.821 --> 00:33:16.610
<v Speaker 5>he gets better every time.</v>

690
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get Outta here guys.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

720
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.120
<v Speaker 5>I was in New York last week and I met </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the publishers and they came out to</v>

<v Speaker 5>about my,</v>

727
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:06.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the beginning days of doing standup </v>

728
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.871
<v Speaker 5>because I have so many crazy stories </v>
<v Speaker 5>about bad road gigs and just struggling </v>

729
00:35:09.031 --> 00:35:14.031
<v Speaker 5>on the road and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what it's like to be an really an </v>

730
00:35:14.031 --> 00:35:15.090
<v Speaker 5>amateur comedian trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

731
00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.610
<v Speaker 5>go out there and get people to laugh for</v>
<v Speaker 5>money and you know,</v>

732
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:22.660
<v Speaker 5>and how fucking crazy it is and how </v>
<v Speaker 5>unsure it is and how you really have no </v>

733
00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.840
<v Speaker 5>idea if it's ever going to work out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you feel,</v>

734
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a completely insecure.</v>

735
00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:32.060
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you feel like there's no way this is </v>

736
00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.220
<v Speaker 5>ever going to really turn out to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>career and how nutty some of the fucking</v>

737
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.150
<v Speaker 5>gigs I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

738
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:40.490
<v Speaker 5>why wasn't you at weigh yesterday?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even think I'm going to answer </v>

739
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.790
<v Speaker 5>that just because it's so retardedly </v>
<v Speaker 5>Britain.</v>

740
00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:43.530
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if somebody else asks if I'll answer</v>

741
00:35:43.531 --> 00:35:48.531
<v Speaker 5>it two ways because I didn't get any </v>
<v Speaker 5>time I got on my flight,</v>

742
00:35:48.721 --> 00:35:53.721
<v Speaker 5>didn't lend until 4:00,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they had Goldberg dual the weigh ins </v>

743
00:35:53.721 --> 00:35:54.010
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

744
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.120
<v Speaker 5>I had my show last night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

745
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.820
<v Speaker 5>because we were in New York and then I </v>
<v Speaker 5>flew back from New York Sunday.</v>

746
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.710
<v Speaker 5>I had Monday to stay home with my family</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then Tuesday flew out again.</v>

747
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:10.430
<v Speaker 5>So unless I'd stayed here in Charlotte,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was no way really I was going to </v>

748
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.910
<v Speaker 5>be able to get to the weigh ins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>

749
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.270
<v Speaker 5>I didn't.</v>

750
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:13.880
<v Speaker 5>I didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

751
00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:19.050
<v Speaker 5>this as too much traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to be home at least a couple of </v>

752
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:22.400
<v Speaker 5>days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise I go nutty when you have </v>

753
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:22.400
<v Speaker 5>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

754
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:22.400
<v Speaker 5>who just can't wait to go home and see </v>
<v Speaker 5>him,</v>

755
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.920
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Hardees fine.</v>

757
00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.870
<v Speaker 5>Hardy didn't have any problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was nothing wrong with them.</v>

758
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:29.010
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

761
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.540

<v Speaker 5>She's hot,</v>

790
00:37:54.501 --> 00:37:56.750
<v Speaker 5>if you're not gay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're gay,</v>

791
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.810
<v Speaker 5>she's probably not the buffer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three 60 tonight.</v>

792
00:37:59.811 --> 00:38:01.340
<v Speaker 5>I think he said he would never do that </v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

793
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:06.670
<v Speaker 5>I think he said the buffer three is </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to retire and to put that shit in </v>

794
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.800
<v Speaker 5>the books,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's over Sun.</v>

795
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:13.150
<v Speaker 5>What do I think about crop circles?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they're incredible geometric </v>

796
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:14.090
<v Speaker 5>patterns when they're not humans made </v>
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

797
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.780
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck knows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

798
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:20.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people that argue that </v>

799
00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:23.051
<v Speaker 5>it's impossible for people to make them </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they've know three times the size </v>

800
00:38:23.051 --> 00:38:26.741
<v Speaker 5>of a football field and they appear </v>
<v Speaker 5>overnight and they were in perfect </v>

801
00:38:26.741 --> 00:38:27.950
<v Speaker 5>geometric patterns and circles and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

802
00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't know know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's very intriguing,</v>

803
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:35.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the very least some of them are </v>

804
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.670
<v Speaker 5>fascinating because there is so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>huge,</v>

805
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:37.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if really,</v>

806
00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:42.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if people really are making these </v>

807
00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:42.930
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

808
00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:47.250
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're flattening them out and just </v>

809
00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:47.250
<v Speaker 5>leaving them there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

810
00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:48.160
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's such incredible geometric art.</v>

811
00:38:48.161 --> 00:38:49.900
<v Speaker 5>You would think that they would want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take credit for that.</v>

812
00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.760
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's just a hoax,</v>

813
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.580
<v Speaker 5>it's incredible that it's a hoax that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they've kept up for this long.</v>

814
00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.120
<v Speaker 5>Like how sneaky are they and what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the benefit of that?</v>

815
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.800
<v Speaker 5>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

816
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.370
<v Speaker 5>what's the reward?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

817
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:05.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have an opinion one way or the </v>

818
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.430
<v Speaker 5>other though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

819
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:07.660
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's also possible that it could</v>

820
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:12.100
<v Speaker 5>be some sort of an experiment that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>do to impose geometric patterns in these</v>

821
00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:12.820
<v Speaker 5>fields.</v>

822
00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.440
<v Speaker 5>It might be something that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

823
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.680
<v Speaker 5>from the sky or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And who the fuck knows how they're doing</v>

824
00:39:17.681 --> 00:39:20.620
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you talk to some people that say that</v>

825
00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.690
<v Speaker 5>these patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way they're made,</v>

826
00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:23.970
<v Speaker 5>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

827
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:28.990
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the nodes of these plants have been </v>

828
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:31.441
<v Speaker 5>blown out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they've had energy pulse through </v>

829
00:39:31.441 --> 00:39:31.441
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like microwaves,</v>

830
00:39:31.441 --> 00:39:31.600
<v Speaker 5>like expanded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

831
00:39:31.601 --> 00:39:35.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't know though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really personally have not done enough</v>

832
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.230
<v Speaker 5>research and really paid attention to </v>
<v Speaker 5>both sides of the argument.</v>

833
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.980
<v Speaker 5>I know one side of the argument is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's bullshit.</v>

834
00:39:41.981 --> 00:39:43.780
<v Speaker 5>And the other side of the argument is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's aliens.</v>

835
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.940
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on both of them seem pretty ridiculous,</v>

836
00:39:45.941 --> 00:39:50.941
<v Speaker 5>so I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not exactly sure what I think about </v>

837
00:39:50.941 --> 00:39:50.941
<v Speaker 5>that shit.</v>

838
00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:56.680
<v Speaker 5>So what did I think about the Luke </v>
<v Speaker 5>Stewart Andre Galvao fight?</v>

839
00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.600
<v Speaker 5>I thought that fight was really </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

840
00:39:59.601 --> 00:40:01.940
<v Speaker 5>I was blown away by that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Luke Stewart Guy.</v>

841
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:05.510
<v Speaker 5>That guy has incredible sweet man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's relentless.</v>

842
00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:10.690
<v Speaker 5>I thought he won the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought he beat him with stand up and </v>

843
00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:13.420
<v Speaker 5>I thought his ground game and negated </v>
<v Speaker 5>golf vowels,</v>

844
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:18.200
<v Speaker 5>grand game and he swept him a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>times and I thought he asked him,</v>

845
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was a real close fight,</v>

846
00:40:19.881 --> 00:40:22.130
<v Speaker 5>but I thought a steward edge them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But man,</v>

847
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:23.450
<v Speaker 5>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he blew me away.</v>

848
00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:28.480
<v Speaker 5>Luke Stewart is a bad motherfucker and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm really looking forward to his next </v>

849
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:28.480
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was really,</v>

850
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.590
<v Speaker 5>really impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>UFC One 15.</v>

851
00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.500
<v Speaker 5>Cincinnati,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they say that might be possible if um,</v>

852
00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.570
<v Speaker 5>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the um,</v>

853
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:38.510
<v Speaker 5>Vancouver thing falls through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's fallen through or</v>

854
00:40:38.511 --> 00:40:43.511
<v Speaker 5>not A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't heard it directly from the </v>

855
00:40:43.511 --> 00:40:44.180
<v Speaker 5>horse's mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when I hear it I'll find out</v>

856
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:48.470
<v Speaker 5>anymore documentaries like the union </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming out.</v>

857
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:51.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did a documentary on Dmt,</v>

858
00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:56.740
<v Speaker 5>it's called DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the spirit molecule and it should be </v>

859
00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.590
<v Speaker 5>done in May and probably out for release</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometime around the summer.</v>

860
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.770
<v Speaker 5>I know they're taking it to film </v>
<v Speaker 5>festivals and uh,</v>

861
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:10.210
<v Speaker 5>that bring it all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a documentary mostly about </v>

862
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:12.140
<v Speaker 5>different people's experiences on dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

863
00:41:12.141 --> 00:41:13.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm the narrator.</v>

864
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:16.220
<v Speaker 5>So that's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do I know who bob?</v>

865
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:22.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bob was always that guy who claims to </v>

866
00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.071
<v Speaker 5>have worked for area 51 and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's Kinda been discredited with a lot </v>

867
00:41:24.071 --> 00:41:25.160
<v Speaker 5>of things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially like his education,</v>

868
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:30.190
<v Speaker 5>I guess he kinda like told some lies </v>
<v Speaker 5>about where he went to school and what </v>

869
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:31.520
<v Speaker 5>degrees are in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but very,</v>

870
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:35.960
<v Speaker 5>very intelligent guy and obviously knew </v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot about that area,</v>

871
00:41:35.961 --> 00:41:40.961
<v Speaker 5>about area 51,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether or not he really did have any </v>

872
00:41:40.961 --> 00:41:44.231
<v Speaker 5>contact with you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fos or with alien spacecraft or any of </v>

873
00:41:44.231 --> 00:41:44.231
<v Speaker 5>that stuff.</v>

874
00:41:44.231 --> 00:41:47.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean it could be total 100 percent or </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit or it could be true.</v>

875
00:41:47.451 --> 00:41:48.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really hard to tell,</v>

876
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:54.130
<v Speaker 5>but when a guy who lies about his </v>
<v Speaker 5>education lies about certain aspects of </v>

877
00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:59.051
<v Speaker 5>his background,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you kind of assume that he's probably </v>

878
00:41:59.051 --> 00:41:59.051
<v Speaker 5>lied about other things as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

879
00:41:59.051 --> 00:41:59.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

880
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:04.360
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really have an opinion either </v>

881
00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:04.360
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Interesting to watch them talk though.</v>

882
00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:04.360
<v Speaker 5>He's very confident,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

883
00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:08.140
<v Speaker 5>he's very confident which could mean </v>
<v Speaker 5>either a who's crazy and that's why he's</v>

884
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:09.950
<v Speaker 5>confident or be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's telling the truth.</v>

885
00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm alright.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta get the Fuck Outta here because,</v>

886
00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:15.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
