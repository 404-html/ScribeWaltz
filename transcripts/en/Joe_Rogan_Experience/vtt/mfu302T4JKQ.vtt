00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Speaker 1>The general good experience,</v>

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:03.471
<v Speaker 2>I told my dad,</v>

3
00:00:03.471 --> 00:00:05.490
<v Speaker 2>I wrote my dad this letter recently,</v>

4
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:06.324
<v Speaker 2>this getting real deep,</v>

5
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.780
<v Speaker 2>our number three of the podcast.</v>

6
00:00:08.781 --> 00:00:09.614
<v Speaker 2>We get real deep.</v>

7
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.540
<v Speaker 2>We're pro nuance.</v>

8
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm ascending to my dad,</v>

9
00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:14.780
<v Speaker 2>but he won't listen to this book.</v>

10
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.700
<v Speaker 2>I wrote this letter that was like,</v>

11
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:17.534
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>

12
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.823
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

13
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.830
<v Speaker 2>I had seen recently like his developing relationship with my son and like it</v>

14
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 2>shot it,</v>

15
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.680
<v Speaker 2>put this thought in my head that,</v>

16
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

17
00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 2>my relationship with my dad,</v>

18
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:30.710
<v Speaker 2>the kids caring for me.</v>

19
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:33.770
<v Speaker 2>The fact that he stayed with my mom and they developed this like place for me to</v>

20
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.800
<v Speaker 2>grow and nurture me and allow me to become a person in that environment.</v>

21
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a north star for me when I left that environment.</v>

22
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I always,</v>

23
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.370
<v Speaker 2>I never wondered what my path was going to be.</v>

24
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.220
<v Speaker 2>I always could look up and be like that bond that I developed,</v>

25
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:49.791
<v Speaker 2>my family,</v>

26
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:52.160
<v Speaker 2>their love for me is like the thing that I'm always,</v>

27
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

28
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:53.661
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking back too,</v>

29
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:54.800
<v Speaker 2>but also looking forward to.</v>

30
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Because that's what defines me and regardless of what I do,</v>

31
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I can always fall back on that,</v>

32
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.640
<v Speaker 2>that my dad loves me,</v>

33
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 2>my mom loves me,</v>

34
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I love them,</v>

35
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 2>and I grew up like with the strength of soul because I knew I don't have.</v>

36
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I have friends that came from the same place that I did.</v>

37
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.451
<v Speaker 2>Same town.</v>

38
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I didn't Marilyn that odd on heroin.</v>

39
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 2>They live in the same little suburb suburbia community that I did.</v>

40
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.840
<v Speaker 2>They had parents that were the same age.</v>

41
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:21.830
<v Speaker 2>They went to the same high school,</v>

42
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 2>they lived in the same environment.</v>

43
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Speaker 2>They went down one way.</v>

44
00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:30.101
<v Speaker 2>I went down another and I truly do feel that that me going down that way was the</v>

45
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:33.740
<v Speaker 2>way that my parents like built this structure around me.</v>

46
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:34.640
<v Speaker 2>That was always a route,</v>

47
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 2>that bond and that love and the things that that's very,</v>

48
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.920
<v Speaker 2>very fortunate and I.</v>

49
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 2>and that's what in that me being able to later on in life,</v>

50
00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:47.201
<v Speaker 2>see how fortunate I was to have that drove me to not fail</v>

51
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>for someone like me.</v>

52
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting to know that there's still a considerable amount of</v>

53
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>speculation.</v>

54
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.503
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

55
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.463
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

56
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.281
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:56.630
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

58
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.463
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

59
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of speculation,</v>

60
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:04.041
<v Speaker 1>but it is pretty off the wall and then other people who think mine are off the</v>

61
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.923
<v Speaker 1>wall,</v>

62
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.800
<v Speaker 1>who's to,</v>

63
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>who's to say,</v>

64
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.021
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

65
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:07.854
<v Speaker 1>I'm um,</v>

66
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

67
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

68
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:11.623
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

69
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>did decent things in the past,</v>

70
00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:15.610
<v Speaker 1>but you should just trust this abuse now.</v>

71
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that's what people think.</v>

72
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

73
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.881
<v Speaker 1>but you see,</v>

74
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:19.651
<v Speaker 1>if it was just me,</v>

75
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I could understand that,</v>

76
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>but I've got these posts and I have a colleague who's done things on this too</v>

77
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>and it can't be that we're all a little off the rails.</v>

78
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:30.324
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

79
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

80
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 1>it can't be.</v>

81
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>There's something out there and now with their hawking points,</v>

82
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>there's something people can really go out and look for and if they don't see it</v>

83
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:37.591
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

84
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>there's something funny going on somewhere.</v>

85
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>If they do see them,</v>

86
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>there's something else going funny on which,</v>

87
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>which they'll have to think of another explanation,</v>

88
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:45.860
<v Speaker 1>unless it's my explanation.</v>

89
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.920
<v Speaker 1>They'll have to think of a different view from the current conflation view,</v>

90
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>which is in real trouble with these observations.</v>

91
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can see,</v>

92
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>there is hate speech in the world isn't you know you don't want it on your</v>

93
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 1>platform,</v>

94
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>but you got to decide what is hate speech,</v>

95
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>when is</v>

96
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 3>it really hate speech and when is it just ignorance,</v>

97
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.410
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes the best way to combat bad speech is to let that speech play out</v>

98
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 3>and let good speech overwhelm it with logic and reason and a better argument,</v>

99
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

100
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 3>That's really what freedom of speech is supposed to be all about that we work</v>

101
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:17.171
<v Speaker 3>all this out.</v>

102
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you start censoring voices and telling people that you're not going</v>

103
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 3>to allow them to talk,</v>

104
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.781
<v Speaker 3>boy you,</v>

105
00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:24.614
<v Speaker 3>you start,</v>

106
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 3>you create this atmosphere where you can start to choose what you're going to</v>

107
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.680
<v Speaker 3>allow through and when you're not going to allow through and then you're gonna</v>

108
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 3>start censoring things that are far more subtle.</v>

109
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 3>You're going to start censoring things that you know they don't seem reasonable,</v>

110
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 3>but you've decided that it's already okay to sensor,</v>

111
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 3>so you've censored this person,</v>

112
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 3>negative sensor.</v>

113
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 3>The next worst thing,</v>

114
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go down the line until it's just people that disagree with you</v>

115
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.431
<v Speaker 4>and then you're like,</v>

116
00:03:49.431 --> 00:03:49.581
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

117
00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:53.720
<v Speaker 4>well my world is perfect now when in fact it's actually just a bunch of people</v>

118
00:03:53.721 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 4>that are talking shit about you.</v>

119
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:56.640
<v Speaker 4>Would you use just don't happen to know about it.</v>

120
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.010
<v Speaker 4>The dove,</v>

121
00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.000
<v Speaker 4>the Dove Company,</v>

122
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.930
<v Speaker 4>they're probably their most successful campaign of all time has been one where</v>

123
00:04:02.931 --> 00:04:06.230
<v Speaker 4>they argued that beauty is a social construct.</v>

124
00:04:06.231 --> 00:04:08.270
<v Speaker 4>You're all beautiful in your own way.</v>

125
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.160
<v Speaker 4>Now that again is a beautiful message,</v>

126
00:04:10.161 --> 00:04:10.371
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

127
00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:10.800
<v Speaker 4>Because if,</v>

128
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.750
<v Speaker 4>if I am someone,</v>

129
00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:15.800
<v Speaker 4>if I'm a woman who doesn't score well on the typical evolutionary cues,</v>

130
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.330
<v Speaker 4>then what do I want to hear?</v>

131
00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:19.640
<v Speaker 4>I want to hear that there is no such thing as evolutionary cubes.</v>

132
00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:21.200
<v Speaker 4>It's all socially constructed,</v>

133
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.651
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

134
00:04:21.651 --> 00:04:22.760
<v Speaker 4>If I have sagging breast,</v>

135
00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:25.190
<v Speaker 4>if I have poor skin and so on,</v>

136
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.600
<v Speaker 4>if I have wrinkly skin,</v>

137
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.560
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to believe that there is no such thing as an universal beauty</v>

138
00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:31.394
<v Speaker 4>standards,</v>

139
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.410
<v Speaker 4>and in that sense dove has been incredibly successful because by peddling false</v>

140
00:04:36.621 --> 00:04:37.400
<v Speaker 4>hope,</v>

141
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.330
<v Speaker 4>they've actually been able to tap into women's insecurities and incense.</v>

142
00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:42.164
<v Speaker 4>That's good marketing,</v>

143
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

144
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.970
<v Speaker 3>The cover of Cosmopolitan magazine that was widely criticized because they had a</v>

145
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:54.331
<v Speaker 3>morbidly obese woman on who was a bikini plus size model.</v>

146
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

147
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

148
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 3>And they were challenging beauty norms.</v>

149
00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a person that's eating themselves to death.</v>

150
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:01.930
<v Speaker 3>You've got fucking assholes.</v>

151
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.110
<v Speaker 3>And so your lack of discipline and your desire to shame people who exercise and</v>

152
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 3>is what you're doing to make them feel bad because you feel bad that you can't</v>

153
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:19.111
<v Speaker 3>put the fucking cook cookies and cupcakes down as a lead you to try to push this</v>

154
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.910
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous standard.</v>

155
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.290
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things my point of view was,</v>

156
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.140
<v Speaker 3>could you imagine if the cover of men's health had an enormous fat guy with his</v>

157
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.470
<v Speaker 3>gut hanging over his belt and,</v>

158
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 3>and people were saying the new standards of attractiveness for men have been</v>

159
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 3>changed by Mike who just drinks beer and eat cake and be like,</v>

160
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck Outta here.</v>

161
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 3>That's never going to fly.</v>

162
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to fly with men,</v>

163
00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 3>but it does fly with women.</v>

164
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:43.871
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

165
00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:43.930
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

166
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.763
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

167
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.030
<v Speaker 4>the fat acceptance movement doesn't just argue that you know not being 500</v>

168
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 4>pounds is unattractive because of the patriarchy.</v>

169
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 4>They actually argue that the medical evidence suggesting that there is a link</v>

170
00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 4>between obesity</v>

171
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 3>and downstream bad effects is all bullshit.</v>

172
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 3>They not,</v>

173
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 3>not just that they there,</v>

174
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:08.801
<v Speaker 3>they also point to one incredibly flawed study that has been wildly disproven</v>

175
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 3>that says that there's some sort of vigor or vitality involved in being</v>

176
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 3>overweight because they get sick less.</v>

177
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

178
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 3>no truth to that whatsoever.</v>

179
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 3>They only,</v>

180
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 3>they only analyze people who were healthy at the time.</v>

181
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.161
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

182
00:06:23.161 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

183
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 3>you can go and Google the study and find out the criticism of that study,</v>

184
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 3>but it's 100 percent horseshit folks.</v>

185
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 3>Being fat is not good for you.</v>

186
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 3>It's really bad for you when you're as big as that woman on the cover of</v>

187
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Cosmopolitan magazine.</v>

188
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 3>She's literally morbidly obese.</v>

189
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 3>She's fucking dying.</v>

190
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 3>She's addicted to food in a horrible way.</v>

191
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 3>And to promote that and pretend that somehow or another this is okay,</v>

192
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:47.144
<v Speaker 3>and we're gonna.</v>

193
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna show new standards of beauty.</v>

194
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:50.211
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>

195
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:54.260
<v Speaker 3>you giant gelatinous bag of meat and tissue.</v>

196
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.831
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

197
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 3>that's a dying person who is addicted to food.</v>

198
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't want to look like that.</v>

199
00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.370
<v Speaker 5>Most of my friends,</v>

200
00:06:59.371 --> 00:07:00.720
<v Speaker 5>we all got busted for drinking and driving.</v>

201
00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:02.220
<v Speaker 5>The best one was a buddy of mine.</v>

202
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.650
<v Speaker 5>They read his was like,</v>

203
00:07:04.651 --> 00:07:04.921
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

204
00:07:04.921 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 5>approximately four in the morning.</v>

205
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.040
<v Speaker 5>We noticed a Maroon VW,</v>

206
00:07:08.041 --> 00:07:09.360
<v Speaker 5>Fox blowing its horn,</v>

207
00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:10.650
<v Speaker 5>trying to pass on the right.</v>

208
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.840
<v Speaker 5>We pulled the defendant over</v>

209
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.580
<v Speaker 5>after repeatedly asking the defendant to stay in the car.</v>

210
00:07:17.581 --> 00:07:18.600
<v Speaker 5>He got out of the car,</v>

211
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.830
<v Speaker 5>threw his keys at my feet and repeatedly stated,</v>

212
00:07:22.831 --> 00:07:23.611
<v Speaker 5>lock me up.</v>

213
00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:24.444
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucked.</v>

214
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:33.010
<v Speaker 5>And this was funny was my buddy was a good look can guy.</v>

215
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.210
<v Speaker 5>And the judge was a,</v>

216
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.580
<v Speaker 5>was a woman and when the guy read that,</v>

217
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:40.481

220
00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:43.530
<v Speaker 5>And he wasn't the brightest guy and he just kind of,</v>

221
00:07:43.531 --> 00:07:44.050
<v Speaker 5>when he went like,</v>

234
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.980

235
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:06.821
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

236
00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:07.900
<v Speaker 5>Some jokes do it.</v>

237
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:10.870
<v Speaker 5>The rest of us have to do like I don't get mad at Brad Pitt,</v>

<v Speaker 5>planning right now who are mad that beautiful people get treated differently.</v>

243

<v Speaker 5>I understand racially speaking,</v>

244
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.140
<v Speaker 5>but you're not going to do the beautiful thing.</v>

245
00:08:31.141 --> 00:08:32.280
<v Speaker 5>And then that's another thing they tried to say.</v>

<v Speaker 5>this is like an impossible standard of beauty to try and live up to.</v>

253
00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:43.914
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

257
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:48.530
<v Speaker 5>She's that level.</v>
