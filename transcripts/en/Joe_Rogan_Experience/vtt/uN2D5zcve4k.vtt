1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.010
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good for.</v>

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3
00:00:03.411 --> 00:00:04.610
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.840
<v Speaker 1>and what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's a,</v>

5
00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:09.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the office is a game and</v>

6
00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:12.770
<v Speaker 1>there's very specific rules where this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the game starts in the beginning of</v>

7
00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:16.700
<v Speaker 1>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a boss and suddenly this person</v>

8
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 1>who's just like you has authority over</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and can control,</v>

9
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.120
<v Speaker 1>basically controls your life and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>food for your kids.</v>

10
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to speak in a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>language dictated by the corporation.</v>

11
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:32.060
<v Speaker 1>It's this terrible fucking game that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people forget as a game and they begin</v>

12
00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:32.631
<v Speaker 1>to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

13
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:35.390
<v Speaker 1>this is the way you're supposed to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is real life.</v>

14
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's when you get like that B of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>

15
00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that b of a song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bank of America,</v>

16
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>do you ever see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like somebody filmed this corporate</v>

17
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 1>merger announcement of a merger between</v>
<v Speaker 1>B of a and a and another bank.</v>

18
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's a guy saying to you to choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

19
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this song that he wrote about Bank of</v>

20
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is what it will make your</v>

21
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.810
<v Speaker 1>eyeballs roll back into your head with</v>
<v Speaker 1>such existential horror.</v>

22
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Seeing these brainwash drone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously spent like a week writing the</v>

23
00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:12.280
<v Speaker 1>lyrics to the song and is passionately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh,</v>

24
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Natalie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm singing the lyrics to how Great Bank</v>

25
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.670
<v Speaker 1>of America is as a corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should be able to play this</v>

26
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:24.671
<v Speaker 1>on pile you as a believer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a corporate video that was made by</v>

27
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Bank of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

28
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.060
<v Speaker 1>That was sent out to his employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know it.</v>

29
00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:34.061
<v Speaker 1>Somebody had a camera out during this</v>
<v Speaker 1>like moment where some kiss ass who know</v>

30
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 1>how to play guitar.</v>

31
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.670
<v Speaker 1>And everybody in the audience is clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

32
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>they seem uncomfortable to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>

33
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.840
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what it reminds me of?</v>

34
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.410
<v Speaker 1>It reminds me of a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cult.</v>

35
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:53.410
<v Speaker 1>The feeling there is that of a people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who've gotten absorbed into a cult,</v>

36
00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:58.220
<v Speaker 1>and that's the only way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they believe crazy shit that</v>

37
00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 1>is only even known by a relatively small</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of people and it's their entire</v>

38
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:08.051
<v Speaker 1>lives banking the bank of America way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that we do business.</v>

39
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:11.660
<v Speaker 1>He's singing about the way they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and it's kind of obscure</v>

40
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:14.030
<v Speaker 1>banking terms in the song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

41
00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:17.540
<v Speaker 1>really terrible.</v>

<v Speaker 5>few people have his office.</v>

119
00:06:56.441 --> 00:06:58.510
<v Speaker 5>We're proud of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A bunch were very embarrassed.</v>

120
00:06:58.511 --> 00:07:01.630
<v Speaker 5>It's very embarrassing and it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be a lot of talking behind closed doors,</v>

121
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.950
<v Speaker 5>but there's a few girls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a few chubby secretaries to thought</v>

122
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.793
<v Speaker 5>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Carl did such an excellent job.</v>

126
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I really felt our higher standards</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming through his songs.</v>

127
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.050
<v Speaker 1>He really represents the B of a higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard</v>

128
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.740
<v Speaker 5>moment where he starts singing one bank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

129
00:07:28.741 --> 00:07:30.260
<v Speaker 5>like coming together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

130
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:35.430
<v Speaker 5>when you realized that he really doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is really going full emotions about</v>

131
00:07:35.591 --> 00:07:39.030
<v Speaker 5>a bank passion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's his life and his team.</v>

132
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 5>Passionate about being on team building.</v>

133
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they made a merger.</v>

134
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:44.480
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets kind of nasty later on in the</v>

135
00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:47.090
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where he kinda does is another bank.</v>

136
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 1>The one of the lyrics is what's in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket?</v>

137
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:58.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not capital one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lyric dissing capital one.</v>

138
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.950
