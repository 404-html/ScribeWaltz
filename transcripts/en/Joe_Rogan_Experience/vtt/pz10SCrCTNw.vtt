00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>it all is about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issues with interspecies</v>

4
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:08.800
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's pray.</v>

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of understand the concept,</v>

6
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>but they can't make the noise cause they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a blowhole.</v>

7
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>But this lady was trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was living with this thing for a</v>

8
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.400
<v Speaker 1>long time and she was jerking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphin off and then they would,</v>

9
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.670
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still train that and lily was doing</v>

10
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:22.620
<v Speaker 1>acid and try it and they cut off funding</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

11
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I respect that,</v>

12
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effort,</v>

13
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time or how does she do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

14
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And however you get another dolphin,</v>

15
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you just have to,</v>

16
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to live with the golf and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game and there's gotta be a better</v>

17
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:40.280
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they were of in that dolphin was</v>

18
00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 1>the fucking happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine.</v>

19
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.361
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>

20
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm living with a lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he thought it was bad.</v>

21
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this big hang up about</v>

22
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But imagine if you had an itch on your</v>

23
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>back and you couldn't reach it and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know you were being taken care of by</v>

24
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>someone and they scratched your back</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you,</v>

25
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh thank you.</v>

26
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I just mean I would always lean towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fun,</v>

27
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.030
<v Speaker 1>put the dog that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

28
00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm more of a don't jerk and animal off</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a guy,</v>

29
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>but I just mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is well then maybe get a better</v>

30
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>facility to keep the Dolphin and get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of dolphins,</v>

31
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:08.210
<v Speaker 1>let them live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them in a,</v>

32
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you know anytime you have an</v>

33
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:11.490
<v Speaker 1>animal in captivity it's pretty fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

34
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know that jerking him off is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right way to do it.</v>

35
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>She's totally run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you do,</v>

36
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>which was if you had to choose an animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>that jerk off,</v>

37
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>which is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people ask me this question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not do it at the monkey cause if</v>

39
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>you do it wrong then bite you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think deal with a monkey would be a</v>

40
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>little bit too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just doing it with a dude rough and</v>

41
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>he was like an off a monkey and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking sunk their teeth of your</v>

42
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like ball exotic.</v>

43
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>I'd go like giraffe because it's tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could stand,</v>

44
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they might come and kick you in the</v>

45
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might look,</v>

46
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>there's always a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always a risk.</v>

47
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:50.001
<v Speaker 1>When he was checking in producer the</v>
<v Speaker 1>daily show,</v>

48
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 1>no one said it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>dyed jerking off a donkey.</v>

49
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's a terrible way to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they're so cute.</v>

50
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the rape a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Really little bears are famous for</v>
<v Speaker 1>raping each other.</v>

52
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

53
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>A vicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they when they fuck they bite and really</v>

54
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>fucking get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>

55
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to jerk off.</v>

56
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't bite you.</v>

57
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Bite the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't need to sleep on this.</v>

58
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you guys know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

59
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.723
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.760
<v Speaker 1>let's put this to a test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

61
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>what she did was ridiculous but only</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous by our cultural standards.</v>

62
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it like biologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real issue biologically is,</v>

63
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you shouldn't have a dolphin and</v>

64
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 1>captivity like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

65
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>But in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 1>the podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started document why they did it</v>

67
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to communicate with</v>

68
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>dolphins in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I did this thing in Hawaii recently</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we went swimming with the</v>

70
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my four year old with me too,</v>

71
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>and she was in the water like right next</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

72
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was holding onto her while we were</v>

73
00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>swimming and she's got the scuba mask on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit and she's,</v>

74
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snorkeling,</v>

75
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>looking down while it's often swim</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath it.</v>

76
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

77
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>And they're wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are not like sea world and</v>

78
00:02:58.621 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll sonar you like</v>

<v Speaker 1>Get near you or they'll make like weird</v>

81
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.540
<v Speaker 2>noises and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

82
00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 2>The lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I talked to Carter to Maya</v>

83
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.130
<v Speaker 2>calculations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying jerk me off.</v>

84
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.550
<v Speaker 2>I've just listened to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

85
00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:15.930
<v Speaker 2>we don't know that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

86
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I speak to off and he wants to be jerked</v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

87
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like seeing that woman went jogging</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Florida and she was,</v>

88
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like seven that night and she had</v>

89
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>a long day at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went right and she just dangled a</v>

90
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>feed off the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got to dangle my feet.</v>

91
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm just fucking hot and an 11 foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>alligator was like,</v>

92
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take you now.</v>

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll be having you now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

94
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you found it with no arms.</v>

95
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Took her arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Alligator was like,</v>

97
00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm an alligator and usually I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do this cause the crocodiles do</v>

98
00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:44.900
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it today to you.</v>

99
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be the only three people</v>
<v Speaker 1>or four people of the year that's going</v>

100
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:52.640
<v Speaker 1>to be eaten by a fucking 11 foot dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll be me.</v>

101
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 1>You the weird that alligators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they let them hang around because</v>

102
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>they're not too aggressive.</v>

103
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're just docile and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually run from you that people don't</v>

104
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 1>just decide to fucking kill them on</v>
<v Speaker 1>site,</v>

105
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>but really everyone in Florida should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in up in arms.</v>

106
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>They should run out to the swamps and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun those fucking dinosaurs down.</v>

107
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Like those are a bunch of kid eating dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating monster shit out of dogs and a</v>

108
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.920

110
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just not as aggressive as crocs.</v>

111
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>If they were crocs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would be killing them.</v>

112
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Leftlane right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crocodiles,</v>

<v Speaker 1>used to have them as pets.</v>

132
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>There was a document or an article I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading about these people that were</v>

133
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>canoeing in the Congo and the guy behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>washes,</v>

134
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:21.070
<v Speaker 1>the guy in front gets taken by the crock</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a Croc,</v>

135
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>just rises up out of the water and</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally snatches the guy and spins the</v>

136
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>canoe upside kayak rather.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And stuck in it and it like goes up and</v>

138
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>down like a bobber and then pump and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then pops up.</v>

139
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>No Guy.</v>
