95
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.980

101
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>So I get some food,</v>

102
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.983
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

103
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>So I come down and I know I'm judging,</v>

104
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:49.741
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking leash,</v>

00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>how far it can jump.</v>

106
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 1>So it Kinda get all the way back down on its little fucking bird house,</v>

107
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>which was probably about three feet long.</v>

108
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sitting there walking with the food and it knows I want the key and it's</v>

109
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>actually holding the fucking key away from its body and seeing if it can have</v>

110
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>its cake and eat it like a fucking human being.</v>

111
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

112
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

113
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.481
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

114
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>So I get the food and when I did was I set it,</v>

115
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.221
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

116
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I took a big chunk of whatever the fuck it was was,</v>

117
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>so we would need two hands.</v>

118
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's set down my keys.</v>

119
00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's set down the keys on the other side of the fucking thing.</v>

120
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>And then it was walking,</v>

121
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 1>it was slowly walking towards it and right as it got to the food.</v>

122
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>This is why I'm a sadistic Gasol raise the got to the food,</v>

123
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I fucking slapped the food off the house so it would be out of its reach.</v>

124
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:38.611
<v Speaker 1>And then I grabbed the fucking keys and ran and this thing fucking leapt at me.</v>

125
00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:39.464
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

126
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.041
<v Speaker 1>swear to God,</v>

127
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:47.041
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God I could feel its breath and I fucking made it away to the other</v>

128
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>side of it.</v>

129
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>And it was fucking pissed at me and I was standing there.</v>

130
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>This is the Middle Costa Rica going,</v>

131
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:52.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>fuck you motherfucker.</v>

133
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.761
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

134
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:55.594
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

135
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 1>So here's the funniest part,</v>

136
00:03:57.581 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

137
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>So I go into my bungalow and I'm fucking still kind of pissed at that fucking</v>

138
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 1>thing and I go and unlock the door and I'm sitting there for like 20 minutes</v>

139
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>reading a book or whatever.</v>

140
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And then I just got on.</v>

141
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I just started thinking about the monkey and I fucking looked out the window and</v>

142
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>it was sitting there all by itself looking all sad and everything.</v>

143
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>And then I felt bad.</v>

144
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>So then I went and I got food and I didn't have my keys this time.</v>

145
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:24.980
<v Speaker 1>And I actually kind of made friends with the thing after that,</v>

146
00:04:24.981 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 1>but I felt when I saw it all lonely and she,</v>

147
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:26.921
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

148
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:27.311
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

149
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:28.160
<v Speaker 1>This thing's a prisoner.</v>

150
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't want to fucking be here and I'm being a dick.</v>

151
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I got to give it to food.</v>

152
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>So I gave it back to it.</v>

153
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:33.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

154
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:33.920
<v Speaker 1>I felt bad.</v>

155
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a happy ending.</v>

156
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.393
<v Speaker 1>The happy.</v>

157
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.121
<v Speaker 1>I felt bad.</v>

158
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:37.954
<v Speaker 1>I don't get an inmate.</v>

159
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
