1
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:02.993
Three,

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:03.893
two,

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.300
one boom.

4
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:09.310
And we are live with El Guapo is he tries to uh,

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.130
navigate his phone with his left hand.

6
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.091
What did you punch her?

7
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:15.270
You write in a table at table that we're stronger than me.

8
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.470
Like yeah,

9
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:18.070
this size table by our city.

10
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.330
Go.

11
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.530
Why did you punch a table?

12
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.861
Okay,

13
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:22.440
so I was in three states in six days.

14
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.210
I slept four hours per night.

15
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.610
I just came from Chicago and this whole thing,

16
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:30.870
I had to get up at four and then I had to shoot a commercial shoot for my buddy,

17
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:35.871
actually assist them starting at 10 and this habit at 10:30 PM so I was 12 and a

18
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:38.490
half hours in and I already said,

19
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:38.701
okay,

20
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:38.830
you,

21
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.670
I'm not going to do it anymore because I couldn't retain information anymore.

22
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:42.780
I had some lights,

23
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:44.220
two lines to remember your day.

24
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:45.090
We're feeding me lines.

25
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.961
I couldn't do it anymore.

26
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:46.191
I said,

27
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:46.760
I did it.

28
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.940
I,

29
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.970
I stopped.

30
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.891
But then I said,

31
00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:49.051
yeah,

32
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:50.180
but if you can do this little there,

33
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.023
okay,

34
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.120
I'll try that one more time.

35
00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:53.490
And of course it did it work.

36
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:53.851
And I said,

37
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:54.240
you know what,

38
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.180
I show on my phone,

39
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.220
my gloves and somehow this is how stupid you are.

40
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.060
You throw off your globe and two seconds after I took it off,

41
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.111
I hit the table.

42
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:08.700
Somehow I still needed to hit something and I decided to do it without a glove

43
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.010
instead of who going to love a solid thing,

44
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.550
guess what's going to lose my pinky knuckle and they end cap acetate your entire

45
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:18.271
arm for that?

46
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:18.811
Pretty much.

47
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:21.490
I think just for a pinky knuckle they call it a boxing fresher.

48
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.130
This these,

49
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.790
yeah.

50
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.780
These two are like,

51
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:29.670
that's what the old school bringing us back to karate combat old school karate

52
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:29.970
days.

53
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.860
I would always recommend that he punched like this.

54
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:34.800
You know what I did and and I know and I was going to do that,

55
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:38.550
but the amount of force that was using at this moment I really fascinating

56
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:40.980
milliseconds and you had to go and say it's better to spread out the impact.

57
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:41.850
You have a more because I was,

58
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:42.780
cause you're hitting it so hard.

59
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.961
Yeah,

60
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:44.490
I knew I was going to break the big one too.

61
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.353
If I would do it.

62
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.530
Yeah.

63
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.390
It was just one of those marbles and five seconds because I hit boom.

64
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:51.871
They look at me,

65
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:52.830
everybody's freaking out.

66
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.290
Then I go,

67
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.123
it's over.

68
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.660
It's just,

69
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.171
you don't pay it.

70
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:55.381
I said,

71
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:55.771
no problem,

72
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:56.341
but it's broke.

73
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:56.611
He said,

74
00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:56.980
how do you know?

75
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.600
I said,

76
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.021
trust me,

77
00:01:58.021 --> 00:01:58.950
I can feel it.

78
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.360
So I was right away.

79
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:01.170
It was call them again.

80
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.003
Everything was good.

81
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.383
Nobody died.

82
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.550
I know that right.

83
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:07.330
Arm's been through how it been and,

84
00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:09.540
and you know this for me to lose cool like that,

85
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.910
that happens once every five years or so.

86
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.900
But I get angry.

87
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:13.800
I never get angry.

88
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.790
I don't have that.

89
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.190
Not that kind of anger that I hit something.

90
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:17.401
I mean,

91
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:18.270
how old am I?

92
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.253
Right.

93
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.020
You seem to always be a happy guy.

94
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.130
That's what I am.

95
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.870
But I,

96
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.590
I think there's also because I'm happy.

97
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.060
So when it gets angry,

98
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.360
that's what the fights,

99
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.820
that's what always happens.

100
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.301
I'm nice.

101
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:30.541
Nice,

102
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:30.781
Nice,

103
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:31.051
nice,

104
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:31.291
nice,

105
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:31.561
nice,

106
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:31.950
nice.

107
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.000
Tried to diffuse it.

108
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.470
Then I realize,

109
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.483
wait a minute,

110
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.690
and then I'm asking them.

111
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:37.230
I say,

112
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.890
you're not,

113
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.210
you don't think I'm afraid.

114
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:39.930
Right?

115
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.231
I said,

116
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:41.520
I'm doing this for you.

117
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:43.200
I'm protecting you right now.

118
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:44.280
That's why I don't want to fight.

119
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.020
And at the moment you say that,

120
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.561
you know,

121
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:50.640
some of them call your bluff and then because he did it for such a long time.

122
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:50.791
Yeah.

123
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:54.450
Then I'll make sure we match spa smash.

124
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.680
Yeah.

125
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.760
But those are the old boss,

126
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.660
Dave [inaudible] busters.

127
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.200
No more more normal boss like this.

128
00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.633
I,

129
00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.980
I like

130
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.790
<v 1>that actually.</v>

131
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.410
And I,

132
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.690
uh,

133
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.220
I don't think it's a healthy buzz either.

134
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.430
How was your arm doing in terms of like the atrophies it growing back?

135
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.550
It's still growing back then.

136
00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:08.860
Yeah,

137
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.630
it gets a little bit bigger.

138
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:10.931
No,

139
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:12.910
I have it as new stuff that I'm trying.

140
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.231
I have it at home.

141
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:16.150
I need bacteriostatic water for it.

142
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.270
It's a peptide called BPC one 57.

143
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:22.090
Did you ever hear that Ben Greenfield told me about that.

144
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:24.040
It's great for tendons and ligaments and stuff.

145
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.280
Yeah.

146
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.130
Even nerves and regrown apparently everything in red.

147
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.540
I mean,

148
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.480
we grow tendons,

149
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:29.650
everything and I'm going to try it.

150
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.610
I'm going to try locally here on the BICEP.

151
00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.880
See what it does as soon as they have the water.

152
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.270
So it seems like the muscles are growing back though.

153
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.710
Like slowly but surely.

154
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:38.931
Right.

155
00:03:38.931 --> 00:03:40.600
But his six years,

156
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.110
six years it this,

157
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.900
it's,

158
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.460
I go 25 pounds.

159
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.900
I can do eight times now.

160
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.000
Bicep curls with the right.

161
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.220
That's a lot better than it used to be though.

162
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.390
I couldn't do Firefox.

163
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.400
Wow.

164
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.560
Yeah.

165
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.280
Not once.

166
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.720
Pat Military has the same thing.

167
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.520
Same thing from his neck.

168
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.980
You know,

169
00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.510
you want to hear it.

170
00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.920
How crazy Pat's injury was.

171
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Pat's disc had deteriorated so badly that his discs fused themselves and he did

172
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:09.850
it and he didn't realize that that guy's a complete animal.

173
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.000
He didn't even realize it.

174
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.710
His dis fused themselves.

175
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.940
He went to the doctor and they're like,

176
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:16.210
well,

177
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.310
we don't have to fuse it or refused itself.

178
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.190
Well you can if you talked to him and he looks at you,

179
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.230
it's like he hasn't fused neck.

180
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.500
Right.

181
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.620
He's always just like Batman.

182
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.670
You can't move.

183
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.070
So I guess grappling,

184
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:30.904
man,

185
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.470
I know they'll blame it on,

186
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.880
on punching and kicking butt.

187
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.170
All the knees injury,

188
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:35.830
everything.

189
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.780
My Rib that was out,

190
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.170
my loss,

191
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.110
that's all wrestling,

192
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.740
grappling.

193
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.780
The rest of them playing wrestlers are all fucked up.

194
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:44.080
We were talking about Kurt Angle yesterday was an Olympic gold medalist.

195
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.370
Fantastic wrestler.

196
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.730
I mean he's got a neck that literally is like the size of my waist,

197
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.860
but it's his neck so fucked up.

198
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:54.400
Both of his arms are tiny and you could see the atrophy in his arms.

199
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.150
His,

200
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.460
his arms don't match his neck.

201
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.610
And you can tell like,

202
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.190
I mean obviously you know better than anybody about neck injuries.

203
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.490
Guys always like their arm shrink because they get atrophy.

204
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:07.420
It cuts off the nerves.

205
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.370
Kale magic show.

206
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.820
But with him as both ways then.

207
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.751
Yeah,

208
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:11.500
well it looks,

209
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.180
we should pull up that picture again Jamie.

210
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.110
See if you can find it.

211
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.780
This is Ronda Rousey's a Instagram.

212
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.081
You,

213
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:17.680
you could see it.

214
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.960
I saw him at the,

215
00:05:18.961 --> 00:05:21.580
at the induction and the International Sports Hall of Famers,

216
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:22.200
therefore,

217
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.230
but Rhonda was there as well,

218
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:24.064
and he was sitting,

219
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.871
first of all,

220
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:25.190
but I,

221
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.870
he was wearing a suit.

222
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.171
Of course,

223
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:28.240
I couldn't tell him while he still looks like a tank,

224
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.910
but his fucking neck is ridiculous.

225
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:31.571
It's so big.

226
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:32.230
But like,

227
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.801
look at this,

228
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:33.634
uh,

229
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.713
what happened?

230
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.440
That's us.

231
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.011
That's great.

232
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:36.330
Yeah.

233
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.300
So you look at his arms.

234
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.620
Oh Wow.

235
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.190
Yeah.

236
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.450
So the size of his neck,

237
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.320
his neck,

238
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.810
it looks like his arms should be as big as his fucking legs.

239
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.920
Yeah.

240
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.730
He just is.

241
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.031
I mean,

242
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:47.200
the guy's been through hell,

243
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.060
but look at the fucking size of his neck.

244
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.871
Have you seen a neck?

245
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:52.120
Like that shit's crazy.

246
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.940
That might build a lot of muscle around it,

247
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.430
I guess.

248
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.701
Well,

249
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:54.911
yeah,

250
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:55.700
it's all fucked up.

251
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.830
And it's been fused and as yours,

252
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:58.640
right?

253
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.450
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

254
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.120
for this fusion front and back while one splint,

255
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:02.271
you know,

256
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:03.230
and it opens it up.

257
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.640
And then the other ones are fusions.

258
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:04.901
And I've,

259
00:06:04.901 --> 00:06:08.090
I have a friend of mine who has five and he can't move.

260
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.380
Like,

261
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.650
I look with me,

262
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:10.990
I have mobility because he can,

263
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.290
he can do this again.

264
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.610
Look to the side a little bit.

265
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.580
I was talking to a buddy of mine about a mutual friend of ours and I didn't

266
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:17.750
realize that he had done this,

267
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:21.290
but he had went to Germany and got his whole back fused.

268
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.430
His whole back is completely rock solid fuse still,

269
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.600
you know as that too.

270
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.390
I would at for him in the hospital don't fry.

271
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.060
Don Frye has that 10 disc fusion.

272
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.420
This Guy Ted died twice on the operating table.

273
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.680
He getting infections.

274
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:37.670
The watts were broke.

275
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:38.810
Everything men,

276
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.160
I was in his hospital,

277
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:40.720
he had,

278
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.020
he lost a lot of weight.

279
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.730
He had a big beard and he said,

280
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:44.331
check this out.

281
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:49.331
He stood up and from his butt crack all the way to above his shoulder blades.

282
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.320
One big zipper.

283
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.400
Oh Dan,

284
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.510
this confusion that isn't so how many did it turn your back?

285
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.220
Probably that.

286
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.133
I don't know.

287
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.440
I have no clue.

288
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.370
We've got to Google that.

289
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.480
That's fucking crazy.

290
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:03.440
How many do you think are in there,

291
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:04.274
Jamie?

292
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.233
I 13 ago,

293
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.890
1516.

294
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.100
So there's one disc hanging in there too.

295
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.740
He's just,

296
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.870
Jesus take me one one disk,

297
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.763
it's going to go,

298
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.330
they say with fusions,

299
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.120
if you have a fusion than the disc below or above,

300
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.021
I'm going to be next.

301
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.150
They say because my husband is 33.

302
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.670
Oh well it's not,

303
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:22.550
it's not that bad.

304
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:23.730
Then only 10.

305
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.100
Eddie Bravo has an artificial disc.

306
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.770
They put artificial disc and now these are [inaudible].

307
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.740
I couldn't do that at the time.

308
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.840
It was in the early,

309
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.000
but Eddie's got no problem with it at all.

310
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:38.631
It moves great.

311
00:07:38.631 --> 00:07:40.370
But that's what I mean for me.

312
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:41.210
I can't do it anymore.

313
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.200
Maybe future,

314
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.650
you know with the printing that they do not have the three d printing.

315
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:49.850
Maybe they can make an exact copy of my spine and then they can still do it in

316
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:50.210
there.

317
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:50.680
Oof.

318
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.590
It will be something.

319
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:52.820
But that's a scary,

320
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.470
cut your spine out and put a fucking titanium one in my,

321
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:58.304
my uh,

322
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.301
my daughter,

323
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:00.081
my oldest daughter,

324
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:02.240
just me and my ex wife,

325
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.220
she's going to have to do it a little lower back.

326
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:06.650
She's got like two or three fusions they're going to need to do,

327
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:08.390
but she's going to do disc replacement as well.

328
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:09.500
Yeah.

329
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:09.710
Yeah.

330
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.360
Disc replacement is legit now.

331
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.961
You know what?

332
00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:12.980
Braulio a steamer,

333
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.280
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Black Belt and very uh,

334
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.400
famous Jujitsu guy.

335
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.390
He's got one in his neck.

336
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:18.890
He was the first guy that ever heard about it.

337
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.540
He fucked his neck up really bad and then won the worlds with a fucked up neck.

338
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.700
And then right after the world's went and got it,

339
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:28.970
a operated on because he was from Brazil.

340
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:31.010
They just do Brazil did it in Europe because he lives in,

341
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:31.844
he lives in England.

342
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.700
Do you ever need will be a [inaudible]?

343
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:34.551
I would let to,

344
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:35.630
German was look at my leg.

345
00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:36.950
They were really good at different events.

346
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:37.940
Yeah.

347
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.340
Well you know we got really fucked up with,

348
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:40.820
um,

349
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.380
during the Bush administration they put a ban on all stem cell research.

350
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.741
You know,

351
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:48.700
they kind of like halted the brakes on funding stem cell research,

352
00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:52.550
which is really a shame because now we're realizing stem cause they were,

353
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.460
they used to think that stem cells had to do with babies,

354
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.301
<v 1>like fetuses.</v>

355
00:08:57.301 --> 00:09:00.030
They were thinking people were going to get abortions just so they could use the

356
00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:00.864
stem cells.

357
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.400
But now they realize that Mesenchymal stem cells and adult skimp stem cells are

358
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:06.234
some of the best.

359
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.000
And one of the things they're doing in American now is sucking fat out of

360
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:09.660
people,

361
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.490
taking liposuction and then using the stem cells from your own body to,

362
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.410
to proliferate injured areas.

363
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.990
I did it two weeks ago for my niece digital.

364
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.211
But yeah,

365
00:09:19.211 --> 00:09:20.220
I have no fed though.

366
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:23.720
So it had to take it out of my hip bone in order to drill a hole in their eye.

367
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.650
They take the marrow,

368
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:25.560
the bone marrow,

369
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.160
and it's unfortunate because in the fet apparently have five times more the

370
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:31.830
amount of stem cells then you have in the bone marrow.

371
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.200
So people out there that are fat pumped to hear that.

372
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:34.560
They're like,

373
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.393
yeah,

374
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.550
worries.

375
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:37.383
And

376
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:39.420
if I were going to injure it,

377
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:41.190
I'll go to a store of medicine.

378
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.340
That's why that gap,

379
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.710
it never got injured.

380
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.391
Even if he did,

381
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:46.224
he wouldn't know.

382
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.020
What does that guy doing these days?

383
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.010
I have no clue.

384
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.000
I know he wrote a book.

385
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:52.860
It was the last time we handle on the inside of the way.

386
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.041
Oh,

387
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:53.874
you guys had them on.

388
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.920
I mean that's five years ago.

389
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:56.754
That guy,

390
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.500
that guy was a fucking character.

391
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:00.390
I mean if it wasn't for guys like tank Abbott,

392
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.670
I mean there would have been no early days,

393
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.410
you know?

394
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.390
I mean you needed a guy look that identify with him.

395
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.090
So a lot of these grades you guys out there so you can do what?

396
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:09.924
I can do this.

397
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.910
That's what you need.

398
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:11.040
Yeah.

399
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.290
I had a giant bell and he would knock people dead.

400
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.513
Yeah.

401
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.970
He was like a Roy Nelson only with no stamina.

402
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:19.361
Yeah.

403
00:10:19.361 --> 00:10:21.220
Well and and and no black belt.

404
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.560
No black belt in Jujitsu.

405
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:22.960
Yeah.

406
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.700
Yeah.

407
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.220
Well Roy Nelson is a fucking complete anomaly,

408
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:26.840
right?

409
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.060
Yeah.

410
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.210
He is like,

411
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.280
if you lose weight,

412
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.980
how is it possible that he trains so hard?

413
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:35.610
I've seen this guy throw where I would like 130 155 pounds kettlebells,

414
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.533
like one arm swings,

415
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.351
waking women being like,

416
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:38.184
it's nothing.

417
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.360
You would lose weight,

418
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:39.661
right?

419
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:40.201
You would think,

420
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:43.550
but he would be a 185 pound phenom.

421
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.551
Instead,

422
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:45.384
he's a heavyweight.

423
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.890
He's like a big contender and maybe it's an implant and the belly that he just

424
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:53.610
wants to do that because the Buddha belly implies kick them and he doesn't even

425
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:54.061
feel it.

426
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:55.230
He's wearing a chest pad.

427
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.420
He imagined someone did that.

428
00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.201
I mean,

429
00:10:58.201 --> 00:10:59.520
if girls get fake boobs,

430
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:02.340
let's think about this cause girls do get fake boobs and they fight.

431
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.200
Yeah.

432
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.480
You know,

433
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:03.860
girls have,

434
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.081
God,

435
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:05.130
I want to mention any names,

436
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.173
but we seen it.

437
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.410
Girls have had no boobs and all of a sudden they had boobs.

438
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.870
You can get fake boobs and still fight,

439
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.700
but what about a fake belly?

440
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.600
What about a guy who says,

441
00:11:15.601 --> 00:11:16.160
I just like,

442
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:16.280
oh,

443
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.113
I like a belly.

444
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:17.970
I like looking good.

445
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.301
You know,

446
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:18.591
if,

447
00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:20.520
if a guy had a fake belly,

448
00:11:20.521 --> 00:11:22.950
I was going to try it to see if we're going to hit it to the back.

449
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.460
I said,

450
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.810
I'll make a hunchback out of him.

451
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:29.160
See if she can move the battle all the way to the back hook to the back,

452
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.330
lower back.

453
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.500
We never had one like that,

454
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:32.550
you know,

455
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.030
I mean the hunchback from Notradame,

456
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.380
that's a high right.

457
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:36.900
But no,

458
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.660
you'd have a show,

459
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.560
a hunch beck from the bottom right,

460
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.580
like lower back.

461
00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:43.530
We can make that like a lumbar pad

462
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.500
work as a lumberjack.

463
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.991
Sleeps all night.

464
00:11:49.991 --> 00:11:50.880
Then he works all day.

465
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.050
Like if,

466
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.380
if you look at Roy Nelson,

467
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:57.490
he's like the size of a really good Middle Wade.

468
00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:57.821
Yeah,

469
00:11:57.821 --> 00:11:57.981
no,

470
00:11:57.981 --> 00:11:58.510
he is.

471
00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:58.900
Yeah.

472
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.610
But meanwhile the guy knocked out,

473
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:02.470
Chuck Congo knocked out.

474
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:05.740
Brendan Shab knocked out some big fucking heavyweights.

475
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.600
Knocked out Mitrione I mean fucking knocked out.

476
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:13.390
A lot of people stayed for the over,

477
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:13.660
right.

478
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.830
They'll show did he knock out seven?

479
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.550
I do not remember that fight.

480
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.921
Wow.

481
00:12:19.921 --> 00:12:20.650
Um,

482
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.650
and it was the worst thing is it's with his right hand.

483
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.380
So you were thinking that people going to the hill to the left up.

484
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.070
Yeah,

485
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.320
but somehow it connects anyway.

486
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:30.840
It's like Rhonda with the arm bars.

487
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.230
You know what's going to happen.

488
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:33.030
We can stop it.

489
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.250
No,

490
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.450
almost knocked down over him.

491
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:34.980
Remember that?

492
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.740
Yeah.

493
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:36.580
He heard over him.

494
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:36.881
Yup.

495
00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:37.714
Stephan's true.

496
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.720
Jesus Christ.

497
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.583
Crazy.

498
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.130
Yeah.

499
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:42.431
I mean,

500
00:12:42.431 --> 00:12:44.110
Roy is like six feet tall.

501
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:44.971
Stephan's true.

502
00:12:44.971 --> 00:12:45.970
Seven feet tall.

503
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.520
I mean fucking animal.

504
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.413
Roy is an animal.

505
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.440
And I honestly,

506
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.060
I mean look at his gut right there.

507
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.350
How much does that,

508
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.850
it weighs about two 50.

509
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:55.743
Right?

510
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:56.680
He's,

511
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.071
he,

512
00:12:57.071 --> 00:12:58.210
I'm not bullshitting.

513
00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:59.140
Yep.

514
00:12:59.140 --> 00:12:59.771
There he goes.

515
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:04.771
He is 50 pounds overweight and he's a world class athlete.

516
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.321
I mean,

517
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:08.200
you cannot say that Roy Nelson is on a world class fighter.

518
00:13:08.201 --> 00:13:08.610
He says,

519
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:08.860
no way.

520
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.100
A world class fighter and he's 50 pounds overweight.

521
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.140
So you dropped down 50 pounds.

522
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.400
Now you're 200 pounds,

523
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.480
you make 85.

524
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.343
You cut weight.

525
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.280
Everybody does that.

526
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.360
Cut 15 pounds.

527
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:19.871
You're 85.

528
00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:20.710
You're world champion.

529
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:21.880
You know,

530
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.080
there's nothing I butter bean.

531
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.411
You know,

532
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:24.460
we were somewhere,

533
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:25.000
uh,

534
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.090
and the athletic commissioner told me from all the boxers on the cart,

535
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:31.600
he had the best blood pressure and cholesterol.

536
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:32.240
Why?

537
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:32.980
Fuck for real?

538
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.510
He said we weren't a shock that the guy is into phenomenal shape.

539
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:38.680
That what he told us.

540
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:39.340
Yeah.

541
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.173
That's insane.

542
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.820
Butter bean made him look like y'all.

543
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:43.840
You're Rodriguez.

544
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:45.003
Look at him.

545
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.180
Jesus Christ.

546
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:46.721
I actually,

547
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:47.201
it looks good.

548
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:48.310
There is a whole family.

549
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:48.791
He looks good.

550
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:49.900
Look exactly like that.

551
00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:51.520
I hear go upper right hand corner.

552
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:51.731
Yeah.

553
00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:53.290
That's what he looks like when he was at its worse.

554
00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.160
Meanwhile he's another guy knocked dude's dead man.

555
00:13:57.161 --> 00:13:58.220
He is so funny.

556
00:13:58.221 --> 00:13:59.260
It's such a good time with him.

557
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:02.260
And there was a percent Prince George and Kennedy,

558
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:02.741
he was there.

559
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:03.574
He's a player.

560
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.890
That's hilarious.

561
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.980
Very funny guy.

562
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:09.761
That's funny.

563
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:10.231
You know.

564
00:14:10.231 --> 00:14:10.480
Um,

565
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.700
he's a fucking hell of a cook apparently

566
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.370
you can't tell,

567
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.233
but it like,

568
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.560
it was watched a video of butter being cooked some ribs and I was like,

569
00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:21.251
damn,

570
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:22.480
that looks legit.

571
00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:23.560
Like a smoker.

572
00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:24.790
Who was cooking them in a smoker?

573
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.631
He broke the rule though.

574
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:26.950
Don't get high if your own supply.

575
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.070
So tell me about this karate combat thing you're doing.

576
00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:34.720
We've seen the videos of it.

577
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.120
Like I liked the,

578
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.270
the fighting surface pit and did you watch it?

579
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.580
I mean that what they do with the colors,

580
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.430
you know when it's fighting it's like a little reddish and towards dark purple

581
00:14:45.431 --> 00:14:46.420
windows a break,

582
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.300
you're going to run up that hill out of the pitch and us a little bit.

583
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:49.881
But I,

584
00:14:49.881 --> 00:14:52.390
I like it a lot to yeah because you can use the

585
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.180
<v 0>wall as well than the 45 angle degree there to jump up.</v>

586
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:56.751
Like parish.

587
00:14:56.751 --> 00:14:57.380
We'll do,

588
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:57.651
you know,

589
00:14:57.651 --> 00:15:01.310
you can use it to put yourself a two to improve in the fight.

590
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:03.200
So I think it's really great.

591
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:04.550
I think the rules as well,

592
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.680
they keep kept everything on distance,

593
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:07.701
long shots,

594
00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:08.540
long punches,

595
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:09.540
the hooks she had her,

596
00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:10.490
the more she took his,

597
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:10.820
you know,

598
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.653
which are pregnant.

599
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.070
So they allow hooks.

600
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.810
They wanted to stay away from upper cuts,

601
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:18.680
elbows and knees just before the cutting a and they don't want to make a bloody,

602
00:15:18.681 --> 00:15:21.170
so they understand that,

603
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.621
you know,

604
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:22.790
you showed him everything.

605
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:23.630
His technique of course,

606
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:26.060
but for people who have been complaining,

607
00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:27.050
I'd make sure I martial arts,

608
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:31.100
I can't understand the ground and some other arts out there too complicated.

609
00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:31.221
Well,

610
00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:33.170
this has been around for such a long time.

611
00:15:33.171 --> 00:15:34.370
Every invited knows karate.

612
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.890
If you find out how many people did karate,

613
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.240
I mean when they grew up,

614
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.170
look at this.

615
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:40.150
It's a beautiful picture.

616
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.510
The way it's filmed as well.

617
00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:43.100
If you the camera,

618
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:45.020
there's one camera that goes behind the people.

619
00:15:45.021 --> 00:15:46.460
It's almost like a movie.

620
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.190
The one camera angle they had from above.

621
00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:49.431
I say,

622
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:49.641
okay,

623
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:51.230
we've got to stop with that one.

624
00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:51.981
That was the only one,

625
00:15:51.981 --> 00:15:52.641
but they did.

626
00:15:52.641 --> 00:15:53.411
They stopped at that.

627
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:56.390
They to the heads up display.

628
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.210
That is also something that nobody had ever before.

629
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.890
That environment is perfect.

630
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.230
It's I just like a movie now.

631
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.380
That's how it should be.

632
00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:04.910
That's how MMA should be fought.

633
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.680
It should be fun and open space.

634
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:11.490
I feel like the cage is too much of a tool that you could use the cage,

635
00:16:11.491 --> 00:16:14.300
you penny guy to the cage and you could beat him up in the client's like Randy

636
00:16:14.301 --> 00:16:15.470
coture rose used to do.

637
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.470
You could use the cage and get back up if somebody takes you down,

638
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.360
if you get taken down in this,

639
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.160
you get taken down like that's it.

640
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.500
You know you're going to have to get up at skill,

641
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.750
like real skill to see if he can get up.

642
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.480
You know when thinking about this as if you were in the distance,

643
00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.150
if it was quite a distance away it seems like,

644
00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.190
oh you could throw guys throw and then once they hit the ground,

645
00:16:35.191 --> 00:16:36.021
she can't clinch,

646
00:16:36.021 --> 00:16:37.010
but the person on top,

647
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:37.611
we just through,

648
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:42.020
you can rain down strikes for five seconds from a squatter position so you can't

649
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.890
go down there and are already saw fights getting finished like that.

650
00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:47.390
So it's a very effective technique.

651
00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:48.620
Why only five seconds?

652
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.360
Because then I go back on their feet.

653
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:54.650
They just want to keep everything short and the more attractive for the

654
00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:55.190
audience,

655
00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.090
the better it is.

656
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.400
It's like for instance now the knees are not in,

657
00:16:58.401 --> 00:16:59.001
but you know,

658
00:16:59.001 --> 00:17:01.280
we were already talking about knees to the body.

659
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:02.480
That could maybe be a really good thing,

660
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:04.580
especially because they guns out there,

661
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.200
so now you can use it against the take down.

662
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.580
Is that a Bitcoin logo?

663
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.330
Yes.

664
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.070
Bitcoin is one of their sponsors.

665
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:10.700
Really?

666
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.440
Yup.

667
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.710
Big Coin blowing up.

668
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:18.220
Now can they leg kick a leg below the knee and I've been talking to them also.

669
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.090
This is the good thing about this organization.

670
00:17:20.091 --> 00:17:23.660
That's why I really enjoyed working with them is that they're open to

671
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:24.291
suggestions.

672
00:17:24.291 --> 00:17:24.461
You know,

673
00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:26.450
they're open to to rule changes.

674
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:29.870
We're going to just see what happens right now and if the urge comes up they

675
00:17:29.871 --> 00:17:30.021
say,

676
00:17:30.021 --> 00:17:30.231
yeah,

677
00:17:30.231 --> 00:17:31.110
we should add locates,

678
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.340
extend.

679
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.710
We're going to start adding location above the knee as well.

680
00:17:33.711 --> 00:17:35.330
Right now they do it below the knee,

681
00:17:35.331 --> 00:17:36.650
just like to do it in the UFC as well.

682
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.403
Well the UFC has,

683
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.750
yeah,

684
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.411
he has everything.

685
00:17:39.411 --> 00:17:43.370
But I mean we see it a lot in the UFC happening and those low because actually

686
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:44.390
they break the bones.

687
00:17:44.391 --> 00:17:44.661
Right?

688
00:17:44.661 --> 00:17:46.130
The formula that will,

689
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:47.503
that will snap.

690
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.110
And uh,

691
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.070
with a low kick there won't happen and we'll just jam.

692
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.650
<v 2>You're lacking.</v>

693
00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:51.181
Yeah.

694
00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:51.631
We'll also,

695
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:53.250
you can't condition the lower leg,

696
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.600
the same weekend condition.

697
00:17:54.601 --> 00:17:55.360
The upper leg,

698
00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.740
your upper leg gets used to taking a beating and some guys can just take low

699
00:17:58.741 --> 00:17:59.210
kicks.

700
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.580
Yeah.

701
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.430
But not that low calf Kik is debilitating.

702
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.451
It's annoying.

703
00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:05.730
And especially if you do it just after like a front kick,

704
00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:06.870
somebody gives you a front kick,

705
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:07.840
you tap into the site,

706
00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.150
immediately kick it.

707
00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:10.770
So when the muscle is still relaxed,

708
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:11.993
it'll go straight through.

709
00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:12.560
Yeah.

710
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:12.900
That's,

711
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.190
that's when something breaks.

712
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.330
If you can't flex.

713
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:15.811
Yeah.

714
00:18:15.811 --> 00:18:17.310
We've seen over the last few years,

715
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:18.810
that's a devastating technique.

716
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.520
Now what are they wearing?

717
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:21.354
Shin Pads?

718
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:21.751
No,

719
00:18:21.751 --> 00:18:22.560
no Shin Pads.

720
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.570
Only this tiny gloves you haven't there in the bachelor.

721
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:25.410
You can check them out.

722
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:26.341
Uh,

723
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:27.060
with the locates,

724
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:27.490
the storage,

725
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.730
which has all been knocked out by strikes.

726
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.020
I liked to take downs as well.

727
00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:33.000
That head up headsup display.

728
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.350
It's really cool.

729
00:18:34.351 --> 00:18:35.640
Right now is the first one.

730
00:18:35.641 --> 00:18:36.480
Who ever does that.

731
00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:38.730
It's a biometric nutrition training.

732
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:39.150
You know,

733
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.560
it's a DNA based,

734
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.090
a heads up display that you can see while the fighters are busy.

735
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:45.924
You get a heart rate,

736
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.951
respiratory,

737
00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:47.671
what they eat,

738
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:48.810
what they trained before.

739
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:50.910
It's all going to start happening in two weeks.

740
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:53.280
It's will become full circle and then their heads,

741
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.300
what is the display will work like when does that work that's going on.

742
00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.690
They were these little tiny things so he can see how fast they hit and what

743
00:19:00.691 --> 00:19:02.430
direction they had propelling.

744
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:03.870
You could probably won't see everything.

745
00:19:03.871 --> 00:19:05.610
It's amazing and these gloves are awesome.

746
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.110
I mean to feel great.

747
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.101
They do feel great.

748
00:19:08.101 --> 00:19:08.934
Yep.

749
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.631
Yeah.

750
00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:10.530
There's a lot of padding.

751
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.723
Yup.

752
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.570
That's pretty padded.

753
00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:13.920
It's much more than a UFC glove,

754
00:19:13.921 --> 00:19:14.580
huh?

755
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.001
It is,

756
00:19:15.001 --> 00:19:15.361
but it's,

757
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:16.200
you know what else too?

758
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.870
It seems like it gives you a curve to your hand,

759
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:19.650
which is great.

760
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.140
Which is an issue with the UFC is the constant poking.

761
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.270
Like if you want to poke some of the hour with this,

762
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.051
you've got to kind of,

763
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:26.010
it's like the pride gloves,

764
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:26.670
right?

765
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:26.851
Yeah.

766
00:19:26.851 --> 00:19:27.460
The pride gloves,

767
00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.260
you'd have that curve to them and we saw much less I pokes and pride then we do

768
00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:32.094
in the UFC,

769
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:32.371
you know?

770
00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:33.720
But I never got that.

771
00:19:33.721 --> 00:19:34.081
Anyway.

772
00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:36.600
In pancreas we just open and strikes and ever poked anybody in the head.

773
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.250
Right.

774
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.330
So sometimes you have to think,

775
00:19:39.331 --> 00:19:40.710
is this on purpose or not?

776
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:41.131
I mean,

777
00:19:41.131 --> 00:19:41.431
sure,

778
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:42.480
some of it's on purpose.

779
00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:42.810
Right?

780
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.980
It's a hard to differentiate how much of his on purpose it really is.

781
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:47.281
You know,

782
00:19:47.281 --> 00:19:49.040
I should have a Jon Jones at the time he got back,

783
00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.700
but he is so calm,

784
00:19:50.701 --> 00:19:51.301
so relaxed,

785
00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:52.580
show everything and then I go and I,

786
00:19:52.581 --> 00:19:54.270
that almost has to be then.

787
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.021
Yeah.

788
00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:55.251
Yeah.

789
00:19:55.251 --> 00:19:57.450
I know you've said that before and I should have warned that thing.

790
00:19:57.451 --> 00:19:57.691
Right?

791
00:19:57.691 --> 00:19:58.620
That's what you were going to say.

792
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.263
You broke my hand.

793
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:00.900
You gotta Punch.

794
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.460
You can punch something pretty hard with this.

795
00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:03.210
Yeah.

796
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:03.960
I mean this is,

797
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.090
these are great paths.

798
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:05.953
Yeah,

799
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:06.990
man.

800
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.460
This is almost like a boxing glove.

801
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.830
It's like a small amount of boxing glove.

802
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.050
It's like it doesn't cover the whole area,

803
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.190
but this is,

804
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.560
this is the same kind of pad as a sheet.

805
00:20:16.561 --> 00:20:17.460
The psycho to the,

806
00:20:17.461 --> 00:20:17.680
the,

807
00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.520
the,

808
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.980
the tricky,

809
00:20:19.981 --> 00:20:21.480
you know Moishy Chucky there's still,

810
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:23.520
and you hit that off officially with the site.

811
00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:26.340
Marois she Chucky and his house and uh,

812
00:20:26.341 --> 00:20:27.300
took his appalling show.

813
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:28.200
It comes from the side.

814
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.700
It's a roundhouse punch.

815
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.800
It's a long hook that you say that,

816
00:20:31.801 --> 00:20:32.371
but then I'm like,

817
00:20:32.371 --> 00:20:33.710
this is Margo rich hand clothes.

818
00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:34.600
Yeah.

819
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.470
Clothes I rich hand punching with the knuckles.

820
00:20:37.471 --> 00:20:40.050
You're hitting with this part of your hand out of the hands.

821
00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.220
Like by the thumb bond.

822
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:41.700
Yeah,

823
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.260
but today with to post your shit up.

824
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:43.890
I know,

825
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:47.770
but that's why you know they keep it long and it makes sure that you see that

826
00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:48.100
technique.

827
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.570
<v 0>Once you start doing short hoax,</v>

828
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.920
that is going to be a different story.

829
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:51.880
We're going to have very close.

830
00:20:51.881 --> 00:20:53.950
You're going to have knees that people go to be confused again.

831
00:20:53.951 --> 00:20:54.260
They want,

832
00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.590
you can't throw hooks,

833
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.570
you can throw hoops,

834
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.403
log hooks.

835
00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.570
What does that mean?

836
00:20:58.570 --> 00:20:59.550
Like you're just too close.

837
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.730
You can't throw a short hook.

838
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.180
No,

839
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.130
not for the clothes distant,

840
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.010
but that,

841
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:03.843
think about this.

842
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.760
Now you're close distance unf to remove yourself away.

843
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:07.840
It's like a combination.

844
00:21:07.841 --> 00:21:09.130
I always tell my students,

845
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:10.870
write up a god writes straight or right up,

846
00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:12.040
got the right straight to the body.

847
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.420
If I give a write up a god,

848
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.920
I'm too close for the right straight.

849
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:15.581
But that,

850
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:15.881
look,

851
00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:16.780
I stepped backwards,

852
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:21.670
but my right and I right away I created this why limit punches?

853
00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:26.671
That seems silly because they want to keep it as close to karate as possible and

854
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:28.810
as clean as possible.

855
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:29.621
Get it,

856
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:30.011
but oh,

857
00:21:30.011 --> 00:21:30.850
left hook.

858
00:21:30.851 --> 00:21:33.020
Like a tight hook of a guy's right there.

859
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.880
Yeah.

860
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.100
But then they say you could also throw a left elbow,

861
00:21:36.101 --> 00:21:36.281
you know?

862
00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:37.570
And they took that out as well.

863
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:37.901
Yeah.

864
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:42.070
So I think this is one of these things that you simply going to have to get used

865
00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:42.580
to.

866
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.320
And think about where the fighter,

867
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.280
it's more difficult for a fighters,

868
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.390
but what do you do if a guy hits a guy with a short hook and knocks him out?

869
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:50.920
I have no clue.

870
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.210
Then the referee's got to step in.

871
00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:53.840
Well if it's in intentionally,

872
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.630
of course that's a problem is going to lose.

873
00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:56.320
Seems crazy.

874
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:56.471
Wow.

875
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:58.600
How can you make someone lose from a short hook?

876
00:21:58.601 --> 00:22:01.180
That seems crazy when all the fights that they had,

877
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.270
all the fights that they had before now already.

878
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:04.840
Right.

879
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.830
None of it happened.

880
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:07.510
So I think we're pretty close.

881
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.000
I think they,

882
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.950
the rules meeting,

883
00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.570
they have a guy who is repeating it like three,

884
00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:13.360
four or five times in a row as I do that do that.

885
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.450
Plus these guys are karate petitioners.

886
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:16.420
See?

887
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.530
So they're not even used to it.

888
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:18.191
Yeah.

889
00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:21.610
But if they're karate practitioners in 2018 then a hundred punch.

890
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.451
There's no,

891
00:22:22.451 --> 00:22:24.100
nobody's just karate anymore.

892
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.800
I mean everybody knows how to throw a hooks and upper cuts and,

893
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:31.180
but I think Jay's rules are the closest rules to the 2020 Olympics is going to

894
00:22:31.181 --> 00:22:32.500
happen in Tokyo as well.

895
00:22:32.501 --> 00:22:32.771
Right.

896
00:22:32.771 --> 00:22:36.270
Karate is going to come back in the Olympics and to 2020 yeah.

897
00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:39.700
And Tokyo really shows in Tokyo and I think this is crazy.

898
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:40.700
Like,

899
00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.450
what did this probably shorter the oldest form I would say on.

900
00:22:43.451 --> 00:22:43.691
Okay.

901
00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:46.430
Now it's started they're doing,

902
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:50.590
but that would be below the neck then like you could kick to the head,

903
00:22:50.591 --> 00:22:51.610
but you can't punch the face.

904
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.380
It's going to have to really figure out dose,

905
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.850
but that's why I love it with it.

906
00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:55.421
But the gloves,

907
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:57.220
they're probably going to be allowed to hit the face.

908
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:57.731
Right,

909
00:22:57.731 --> 00:22:58.780
but not in the Olympics.

910
00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.650
Right?

911
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:00.483
I Dunno.

912
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:01.840
I Dunno about that yet.

913
00:23:01.841 --> 00:23:02.021
Yeah,

914
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:02.741
because taekwondo,

915
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:03.580
they took it out as well.

916
00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:04.050
Right,

917
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.030
and you're going to have the head gear in boxing that you had this optional now

918
00:23:07.031 --> 00:23:08.090
I brought him for and I believe,

919
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:08.973
yeah.

920
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:09.430
Yeah.

921
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.701
Well,

922
00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:12.510
if it's the same glove is a make it the same way,

923
00:23:12.511 --> 00:23:13.320
why would they,

924
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.800
what are they willing to listen to you?

925
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:15.720
Yes,

926
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:15.920
they will.

927
00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.480
These people.

928
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:16.871
Oh No,

929
00:23:16.871 --> 00:23:17.980
I'm already talking to him.

930
00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:18.820
That's the greatest thing.

931
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:19.720
Keep Flash.

932
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.770
I'm a very popular guy.

933
00:23:20.771 --> 00:23:21.451
I think that people,

934
00:23:21.451 --> 00:23:25.180
it's kind of every time you get a text you get for your phone flashes,

935
00:23:25.181 --> 00:23:26.290
like the light flashes.

936
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:27.071
Oh,

937
00:23:27.071 --> 00:23:27.821
I do that on a,

938
00:23:27.821 --> 00:23:28.271
on a bag.

939
00:23:28.271 --> 00:23:30.850
Because many times I have my phone like this.

940
00:23:30.851 --> 00:23:31.181
Right.

941
00:23:31.181 --> 00:23:32.014
And then I,

942
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.370
now I can't hear it,

943
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.930
but I can see it now.

944
00:23:34.931 --> 00:23:35.491
Big Life.

945
00:23:35.491 --> 00:23:36.324
Flash flashed,

946
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:36.910
text me,

947
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:37.290
texted me,

948
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.123
see what happens.

949
00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:39.370
I do that on purpose.

950
00:23:39.371 --> 00:23:40.960
I keep my phone flat on purpose.

951
00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:42.130
Like leave me the fuck alone.

952
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:43.960
I don't want,

953
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.020
I don't want to look at my phone five seconds because

954
00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:46.853
<v 2>it's flashing.</v>

955
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.331
Yeah.

956
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:47.751
And Oh,

957
00:23:47.751 --> 00:23:48.584
and by the way,

958
00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.130
is she,

959
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.881
that's what I'm looking.

960
00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:51.620
Hooks aren't penalties anymore.

961
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:52.250
Oh,

962
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:53.060
they changed it.

963
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:53.390
Yeah.

964
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:54.020
Thank you.

965
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.220
Thank you very much.

966
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.240
Cause that seems silly.

967
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.540
Yeah.

968
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.860
She should be able to hook somebody.

969
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.551
Just,

970
00:23:58.551 --> 00:23:58.791
I mean,

971
00:23:58.791 --> 00:23:59.690
it's a great punch.

972
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:00.700
It's like,

973
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:00.981
I mean,

974
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:01.491
I understand.

975
00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:02.690
If you want to eliminate elbows,

976
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:04.040
glory took out elbows.

977
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.761
You know,

978
00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:07.310
Bella tour doesn't have elbows bell toward kickboxing rather.

979
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:08.271
But I think,

980
00:24:08.271 --> 00:24:08.720
um,

981
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.370
punches,

982
00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:10.310
it should be punches.

983
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:10.611
You know,

984
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:10.861
any,

985
00:24:10.861 --> 00:24:11.810
any way you want to punch.

986
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:12.580
Yeah.

987
00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:12.850
Well,

988
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:13.910
back fish to everything.

989
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:15.890
You can do a sliding as well.

990
00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:19.130
All the kicks are allowed to get also except put the low kick to the thigh,

991
00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:19.641
but for the rest,

992
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:20.330
every cake,

993
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:21.230
every jumpy kick,

994
00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:21.980
everything's,

995
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.221
you know.

996
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:23.054
But that's,

997
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.700
that's again me talking and we'll go to see.

998
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.870
Whereas this is going to listen to you by

999
00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:32.480
touch.

1000
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.313
I wonder.

1001
00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:35.550
That's your eight months.

1002
00:24:35.551 --> 00:24:35.721
Yeah.

1003
00:24:35.721 --> 00:24:36.350
Yeah.

1004
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.101
That was the reason.

1005
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:40.400
A lot of Dutch guys one remember all the way back here with the kickboxing?

1006
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:41.570
Fuck yeah,

1007
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:42.410
I'm on deckers.

1008
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:43.191
Rob came in,

1009
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:43.880
the room came up.

1010
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.800
God Damn Man,

1011
00:24:44.801 --> 00:24:46.400
he's still the old remember to have fun.

1012
00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:47.234
Yeah man.

1013
00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:47.910
Yeah,

1014
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.040
those are the guys.

1015
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:50.063
Yeah.

1016
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.133
So yeah,

1017
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:52.850
I'm looking forward to it.

1018
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:55.700
If you're a nowhere on my,

1019
00:24:55.701 --> 00:24:56.150
uh,

1020
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:56.571
what is it?

1021
00:24:56.571 --> 00:24:59.140
April 26th in Miami to have the first shot.

1022
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.980
I'm pretty sure they will live out of town.

1023
00:25:00.981 --> 00:25:01.610
Unfortunately.

1024
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:02.780
April 26 in Miami.

1025
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.130
That's the first show in America.

1026
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.570
Where would these other ones filmed?

1027
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.030
Uh,

1028
00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:06.741
overseas.

1029
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:07.071
They do,

1030
00:25:07.071 --> 00:25:08.040
they do it everywhere they have,

1031
00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.620
this will be the first year.

1032
00:25:09.621 --> 00:25:10.520
It's free guys.

1033
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.540
So do that as well.

1034
00:25:11.541 --> 00:25:15.770
Also what you can do free watch or read to watch to be there or to watch?

1035
00:25:15.771 --> 00:25:15.850
No,

1036
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:16.683
no.

1037
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.000
Oh you go to karate.com there's a button where you can click watch it live and

1038
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:21.860
you're going to be streamed,

1039
00:25:21.861 --> 00:25:25.010
but you also have an app and they have a really cool app because it has app,

1040
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:26.390
gives you the heads up display.

1041
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.970
You'll see there a right at the top watch life.

1042
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:30.463
That's where you click,

1043
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.820
sign the email,

1044
00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:33.890
read streaming to our next event.

1045
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:35.030
Don't have to do anything.

1046
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:36.320
Nice.

1047
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:36.771
So,

1048
00:25:36.771 --> 00:25:37.280
um,

1049
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.450
who's putting this together?

1050
00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:39.470
How do you know these people?

1051
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.110
Well they contacted me.

1052
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:42.020
It is a whole,

1053
00:25:42.021 --> 00:25:46.130
a bunch of guys to guide a lot of karate experts as well and they uh,

1054
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.220
and I think their site with the 2020 Olympics,

1055
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:49.850
you know,

1056
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.090
and I've been talking about is also for a while show.

1057
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.630
Why is not anybody doing this?

1058
00:25:53.631 --> 00:25:56.310
We had chuck Norris doing it right for a while.

1059
00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.410
And I thought,

1060
00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:58.490
I thought that was cool.

1061
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.151
And now this,

1062
00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:00.380
when I saw this with a bit,

1063
00:26:00.381 --> 00:26:00.591
I go,

1064
00:26:00.591 --> 00:26:00.831
man,

1065
00:26:00.831 --> 00:26:01.130
this,

1066
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:02.630
I truly believe it's going to take up.

1067
00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:04.010
I think a lot of people get to enjoy this.

1068
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:04.251
Well,

1069
00:26:04.251 --> 00:26:04.881
I hope so.

1070
00:26:04.881 --> 00:26:05.091
I mean,

1071
00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:08.630
I've been saying for the longest time that striking sports in America,

1072
00:26:08.631 --> 00:26:11.660
like you got boxing and then nobody pays attention to the other shit.

1073
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.871
I mean,

1074
00:26:11.871 --> 00:26:14.150
people barely paid attention to kickboxing.

1075
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:14.670
Yup.

1076
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:16.190
Just not nearly as popular.

1077
00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:16.700
It doesn't mean,

1078
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.870
especially to me,

1079
00:26:17.871 --> 00:26:19.410
I'm a giant fan of Muay Thai.

1080
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:19.821
I mean,

1081
00:26:19.821 --> 00:26:23.780
I love watching more tie and I never understood why more Thai wasn't more

1082
00:26:23.781 --> 00:26:25.010
successfully nine states.

1083
00:26:25.011 --> 00:26:27.050
I know a lion fight had,

1084
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:27.470
uh,

1085
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:28.790
some good traction.

1086
00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:29.931
They were doing pretty well,

1087
00:26:29.931 --> 00:26:32.420
but I don't think they're on access TV anymore.

1088
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:33.620
They stopped and I,

1089
00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:34.041
you know,

1090
00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:35.000
this is the,

1091
00:26:35.001 --> 00:26:39.230
people are asking for it every time complaining about mixed martial arts.

1092
00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:41.810
A lot of people because they don't understand what's going on on the ground.

1093
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.070
Now we finally have,

1094
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:44.610
<v 0>you know,</v>

1095
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.810
Thai boxing and,

1096
00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:46.481
and not watching it.

1097
00:26:46.481 --> 00:26:49.730
And then the glory has the back's best fighters on the planet.

1098
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:49.960
Right?

1099
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.420
I mean there's an unbelievable show,

1100
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.730
but not enough to people watch it.

1101
00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.340
<v 3>Well it's not mainstream enough in to,</v>

1102
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.000
in terms of like it's exposure.

1103
00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.890
I mean you get it on UFC fight pass,

1104
00:26:59.891 --> 00:27:00.701
which is amazing.

1105
00:27:00.701 --> 00:27:04.570
And then you can get it on ESPN three which is only online and sometimes ESPN

1106
00:27:04.571 --> 00:27:05.404
too.

1107
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:06.340
But you know,

1108
00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:06.910
I think,

1109
00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:11.910
I mean you will Rico Verhoeven and you see the Jamal Benson eat shit and he said

1110
00:27:13.181 --> 00:27:14.250
he was going to do it like that.

1111
00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:19.000
And Ben said he caught him too early and density could knock them out six years

1112
00:27:19.001 --> 00:27:19.690
ago.

1113
00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:21.820
That was a fucking amazing fight.

1114
00:27:21.821 --> 00:27:23.020
If that was on television,

1115
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.050
that fight was on TV and the end would,

1116
00:27:25.051 --> 00:27:28.840
Ricoh is porn it on and Ben's d collapsed in the ropes mean and they're big

1117
00:27:28.841 --> 00:27:29.830
giant fucking guys.

1118
00:27:29.831 --> 00:27:31.090
I mean that was an amazing fight.

1119
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.190
Rico is incredible.

1120
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.530
His cardio for a giant guy,

1121
00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:36.131
you know,

1122
00:27:36.131 --> 00:27:36.964
for a big

1123
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.850
<v 0>distances is ring strategy.</v>

1124
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.010
Everything was the complete guy.

1125
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.200
<v 3>And he's a young guy.</v>

1126
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.600
Super Smart also.

1127
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:45.780
Is he like 29

1128
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:46.621
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1129
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:47.250
I think so.

1130
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.230
Like a corner right?

1131
00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.110
Cause it started out as well.

1132
00:27:49.111 --> 00:27:49.291
Yeah.

1133
00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:49.711
So,

1134
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:50.370
uh,

1135
00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:53.180
<v 3>I mean he's got a long future ahead of you.</v>

1136
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.140
Think of the amount of experience he has already.

1137
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.080
How will pull up pull up Rico Verhoeven,

1138
00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:58.950
glory,

1139
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:59.970
heavyweight champions.

1140
00:27:59.971 --> 00:28:00.804
He how old he is.

1141
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.640
I think he just had a birthday,

1142
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:03.061
I think.

1143
00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:05.910
I think he turned 29 he's a fucking beast,

1144
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:06.390
man.

1145
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.140
Yes.

1146
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.430
Was it today?

1147
00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.850
Turns 29 half happy.

1148
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:11.761
Yeah.

1149
00:28:11.761 --> 00:28:13.140
I just don't understand.

1150
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:14.160
I really don't understand.

1151
00:28:14.161 --> 00:28:16.140
I don't understand why that's not more popular.

1152
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.530
<v 0>It's keeping it simple and this,</v>

1153
00:28:20.531 --> 00:28:22.270
now even you take the knees out,

1154
00:28:22.271 --> 00:28:24.790
keep it a little bit more separate so that people can see,

1155
00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.830
see that technique better.

1156
00:28:25.831 --> 00:28:26.651
It's not better technique.

1157
00:28:26.651 --> 00:28:28.060
You can see the technique better.

1158
00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:28.420
Right?

1159
00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.650
I think we'll do a lot of good.

1160
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:30.221
Also,

1161
00:28:30.221 --> 00:28:32.110
a lot of the kits when they say,

1162
00:28:32.111 --> 00:28:32.530
Hey Mama,

1163
00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:36.070
want to watch mixed martial arts when you're very young yet I don't think the

1164
00:28:36.071 --> 00:28:37.240
parents are going to allow that.

1165
00:28:37.241 --> 00:28:38.290
That's still that little,

1166
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:38.920
you know,

1167
00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.300
they don't know karate.

1168
00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:40.541
Oh,

1169
00:28:40.541 --> 00:28:41.500
please go watch.

1170
00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.300
Did you see this

1171
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.050
<v 3>crazy shit?</v>

1172
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:47.460
They're talking about Conor McGregor fighting Floyd Mayweather with no shoes on

1173
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.430
in an MMA cage with MMA gloves.

1174
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:51.510
You can clinch,

1175
00:28:51.511 --> 00:28:52.680
but no takedowns,

1176
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:53.520
no knees,

1177
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.390
no elbows,

1178
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.313
no kicks,

1179
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.520
no submissions.

1180
00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.750
But clench,

1181
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:00.450
clench.

1182
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:01.740
You can fight him to clinch.

1183
00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:02.891
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1184
00:29:02.891 --> 00:29:03.281
well I,

1185
00:29:03.281 --> 00:29:03.641
you know,

1186
00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:03.890
may,

1187
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.250
whereas it's an animal that are all so,

1188
00:29:06.251 --> 00:29:06.641
yeah,

1189
00:29:06.641 --> 00:29:07.474
but still,

1190
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:08.050
come on,

1191
00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.790
let me kick one kick be league,

1192
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:10.660
<v 3>kick,</v>

1193
00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.110
kick.

1194
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.870
It would end it.

1195
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:12.710
If he had kicks,

1196
00:29:12.711 --> 00:29:13.544
that would be the difference.

1197
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.560
But,

1198
00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.970
but Connor even fighting from the clinch,

1199
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:18.470
you could tie him up.

1200
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.890
You could tie them up and hold onto them and hit them like Randy couture style.

1201
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.180
You remember when,

1202
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:23.810
um,

1203
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:28.810
Shane Carwyn fought Frank Mir and tied him up and just obliterated him with

1204
00:29:30.111 --> 00:29:30.740
uppercuts,

1205
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:31.900
jet Bobo,

1206
00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.280
Bobo Monster.

1207
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:35.051
<v 0>But then again,</v>

1208
00:29:35.051 --> 00:29:36.370
he chooses to stand there.

1209
00:29:36.371 --> 00:29:39.300
I don't think that maybe what is going to choose to stand there if he didn't

1210
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.410
have a choice pops out.

1211
00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:41.110
He needs to.

1212
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.943
Why not?

1213
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.640
It's not like he pulls him to the,

1214
00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:44.740
it gets needed into face.

1215
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:45.221
You see what I mean?

1216
00:29:45.221 --> 00:29:45.890
Because he's not clean

1217
00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:46.670
<v 3>each with him.</v>

1218
00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:49.640
If he can clinch with them and they're standing on the outside and Connor can

1219
00:29:49.641 --> 00:29:50.361
grab a hold of them,

1220
00:29:50.361 --> 00:29:50.820
how's May,

1221
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:51.890
where they're going to shake him off.

1222
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:53.000
He's not going to,

1223
00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:53.660
like,

1224
00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.600
if Connor decides to just wrap a hold of one of his arms,

1225
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.630
just get them in an over hook and just start punching him in the face.

1226
00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.650
W Floyd's fucked his whole thing is boxing.

1227
00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.080
His whole thing is boxing.

1228
00:30:05.081 --> 00:30:05.611
A little buddies,

1229
00:30:05.611 --> 00:30:07.490
his shoulder rolls moves.

1230
00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:09.560
He's not gonna be able to stop Conda from grabbing them.

1231
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.491
Connor's a bigger,

1232
00:30:10.491 --> 00:30:11.390
stronger guy.

1233
00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:15.350
If he grabs Floyd by the back of the neck and holds them in place and punches

1234
00:30:15.351 --> 00:30:17.030
him in the face Floyd's fucked.

1235
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:19.780
I don't think he understands when you say the clinches.

1236
00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:20.450
Okay.

1237
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:21.860
If you could strike from the clinch,

1238
00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.090
he's fucked.

1239
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:27.170
I'll put my money on Connor all day if he can strike from the clinch.

1240
00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:32.410
Now if they just have MMA fight with boxing gloves or a boxing fight with MMA

1241
00:30:32.781 --> 00:30:33.614
gloves rather,

1242
00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.150
that is a different thing.

1243
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.670
That's a different animal and I think Floyd's just so much better than,

1244
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.540
<v 0>that's what I thought that you meant.</v>

1245
00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:39.951
<v 3>No,</v>

1246
00:30:39.951 --> 00:30:40.131
no,

1247
00:30:40.131 --> 00:30:40.400
no.

1248
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.400
I mean clinching the f the what?

1249
00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.180
What I read the only difference.

1250
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:45.170
They're not going to let him kick.

1251
00:30:45.171 --> 00:30:46.070
They're not gonna let him punch.

1252
00:30:46.071 --> 00:30:49.070
Not because I'm an elbow or a knee or take down or submissions,

1253
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.490
but they'll let him clinch and punch from the clinch.

1254
00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:53.810
Just that alone.

1255
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:54.260
Yup.

1256
00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.370
That's a game changer.

1257
00:30:55.371 --> 00:30:56.204
Just out alone.

1258
00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:56.730
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1259
00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:57.121
I don't,

1260
00:30:57.121 --> 00:30:57.481
I don't know.

1261
00:30:57.481 --> 00:30:59.790
I'm going to have to see that because you know flood's going to know they're

1262
00:30:59.791 --> 00:31:00.990
going to work on that as well,

1263
00:31:00.991 --> 00:31:02.310
is going to work on those defense.

1264
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:04.020
He's an incredible athlete.

1265
00:31:04.021 --> 00:31:04.611
I mean to Zuni,

1266
00:31:04.611 --> 00:31:05.221
a few things.

1267
00:31:05.221 --> 00:31:07.260
This is not like he's going to have to learn the whole game.

1268
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:07.681
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1269
00:31:07.681 --> 00:31:11.700
But holding onto someone and punching them is such a different,

1270
00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.890
it's just a completely different chapters.

1271
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.231
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1272
00:31:14.231 --> 00:31:17.420
But as soon as you hold onto somebody at me and she didn't get past the dated

1273
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:18.370
your own arm as well,

1274
00:31:18.371 --> 00:31:19.750
you don't have the defense there as well.

1275
00:31:19.751 --> 00:31:21.170
So maybe we can start attacking,

1276
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.240
taking Emma also.

1277
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:23.550
That's a one hand fight it,

1278
00:31:23.551 --> 00:31:25.540
it's literally a ice hockey.

1279
00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:26.291
Right?

1280
00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:27.550
If you think about the graph,

1281
00:31:27.551 --> 00:31:28.560
but it's not hitting each other

1282
00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:29.241
<v 3>sort of.</v>

1283
00:31:29.241 --> 00:31:29.511
Yeah,

1284
00:31:29.511 --> 00:31:29.721
yeah,

1285
00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:30.050
yeah.

1286
00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:31.490
But smaller gloves,

1287
00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.560
Conor will have more impact with his punches.

1288
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:34.100
That's true.

1289
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.940
And he's so much used to much more used to fighting from the clinch like that

1290
00:31:37.941 --> 00:31:40.010
where you can hold and hit at the same time.

1291
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.110
I'm interested in that fight.

1292
00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:43.910
What about foot stomps?

1293
00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:45.561
<v 0>You know what?</v>

1294
00:31:45.561 --> 00:31:48.950
That's what the last time I heard somebody say he always just super effective.

1295
00:31:48.951 --> 00:31:49.470
Foodstamps yeah.

1296
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:52.130
Give me one fight that ever got stuck with a foot stomp.

1297
00:31:52.131 --> 00:31:52.964
Never.

1298
00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.103
It's annoying.

1299
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:57.050
It's annoying that you ever fight where someone's foot stomped.

1300
00:31:57.051 --> 00:31:58.010
You know,

1301
00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:59.990
never know Gerry foot stomp anybody.

1302
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.800
No,

1303
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.110
no.

1304
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.630
I think I'm one of those guys who would do it.

1305
00:32:02.631 --> 00:32:02.991
Bag it.

1306
00:32:02.991 --> 00:32:05.060
That's why they and why they didn't do it.

1307
00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:07.311
Marco,

1308
00:32:07.311 --> 00:32:09.350
who else was like the first guy to introduce that wasn't,

1309
00:32:09.351 --> 00:32:09.920
yeah.

1310
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.111
Yeah.

1311
00:32:10.111 --> 00:32:10.671
You did that.

1312
00:32:10.671 --> 00:32:10.940
Yeah.

1313
00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:11.181
Yeah.

1314
00:32:11.181 --> 00:32:12.080
Marco foot stomping.

1315
00:32:12.081 --> 00:32:13.100
She got a bunch of notes here,

1316
00:32:13.101 --> 00:32:13.370
man.

1317
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:13.490
Yeah,

1318
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.761
I know.

1319
00:32:13.761 --> 00:32:14.031
I do.

1320
00:32:14.031 --> 00:32:14.900
I just spread it out.

1321
00:32:14.901 --> 00:32:15.770
This is what if my,

1322
00:32:15.771 --> 00:32:16.520
uh,

1323
00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.211
my pet things,

1324
00:32:17.211 --> 00:32:18.710
I'm throwing it out because you know,

1325
00:32:18.711 --> 00:32:23.711
going back to karate and with the w w with reading about it to all to get hold

1326
00:32:24.201 --> 00:32:25.034
of terms back.

1327
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:26.023
That's,

1328
00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:26.361
you know,

1329
00:32:26.361 --> 00:32:27.470
so that's where I'm going here.

1330
00:32:27.471 --> 00:32:28.370
Like at the marshy gears,

1331
00:32:28.371 --> 00:32:29.151
we didn't know that the oil boy,

1332
00:32:29.151 --> 00:32:31.230
she geared to suit Toby.

1333
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:32.990
I'm she hearing all those cakes you see,

1334
00:32:32.991 --> 00:32:34.630
but you shoot notice it.

1335
00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.970
You notice you window background.

1336
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.131
Oh,

1337
00:32:37.131 --> 00:32:37.441
that's still,

1338
00:32:37.441 --> 00:32:38.274
you've got to Jackie's.

1339
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:41.983
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1340
00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:42.830
Yeah.

1341
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:43.411
We've got to check you.

1342
00:32:43.411 --> 00:32:44.490
So we've got the gear I guess.

1343
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:45.423
Yeah.

1344
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.120
Um,

1345
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.700
so how many events are they going to do a year of this?

1346
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.930
It's all bunch.

1347
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.340
They've got to spread them out all over the place.

1348
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.360
I fought for the people.

1349
00:32:53.361 --> 00:32:54.160
What I would say.

1350
00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:54.930
Yeah,

1351
00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:56.420
just karate.com.

1352
00:32:56.421 --> 00:32:58.840
What a great domain name by the way as well to have that.

1353
00:32:58.970 --> 00:32:59.510
Yeah,

1354
00:32:59.510 --> 00:32:59.991
that's a,

1355
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:00.980
I was thinking the same thing.

1356
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:02.120
It's been expensive as fuck.

1357
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.013
I think so too.

1358
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:04.310
But they have it.

1359
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.020
Go there for all your favorite fighters.

1360

That's a big one.

1366
00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:12.230
That's a big thing to happen.

1367
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:12.570

1371
00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:22.334

1372
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:23.131

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.720
naked girls don't come.

1376
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.700
That gives you a lot of money.

1377
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.593
That's a lot of money.

1378
00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.493
Way More than karate.

1379
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:30.691
Look,

1380
00:33:30.691 --> 00:33:32.570

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.130
Don't even click on it.

1383
00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.430
You would get a bunch of popups and virus.

1384
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.120
A friend of mine does that.

1385
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:43.870
What does this Jamie makeup.com sold for $2 million rodeo.com and karate.com for

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:46.783

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.121

1394
00:33:53.121 --> 00:33:53.960
That's what he does.

1395
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.380
Buy and donate then.

1396
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.110
My name's Mike.

1397
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.010
Can you go back?

1398
00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:59.300
You mentioned go back in time.

1399
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.433
Oh my God.

1400
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.251
When the ready,

1401
00:34:01.251 --> 00:34:02.360
all the domain names down.

1402
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.430
Nobody even saw any of this should come and didn't.

1403
00:34:04.431 --> 00:34:06.620
business.com code for like 10 million bucks.

1404
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:07.933
Something crazy.

1405
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.370
He,

1406
00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:11.090
one of those got busy.

1407
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.710
I wouldn't give you a nickel for that shit.

1408
00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:14.510
What the fuck's going to business.com?

1409
00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:15.344
What are you doing there?

1410
00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.700
I got to do business.

1411
00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:17.893
It's stupid.

1412
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.830
If you're doing business,

1413
00:34:18.831 --> 00:34:21.950
you don't go looking@business.com that doesn't even make any sense.

1414
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.810
That's a worthless fucking domain.

1415
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:25.280
I bet that was a ghost town.

1416
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.640
I bet no one's going to business.com [inaudible] dot com what is it?

1417
00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:29.841
No,

1418
00:34:29.841 --> 00:34:32.360
your business grow your pissed as fuck off.

1419
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.403
Do it different.

1420
00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:37.140
Z N I s even business.

1421
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:38.180
No one's going to that.

1422
00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:38.661
You go to that.

1423
00:34:38.661 --> 00:34:39.290
It's a porn site.

1424
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:40.123
Can't spell.

1425
00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:40.530
Yeah,

1426
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:41.363
you're an idiot.

1427
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:45.830
You go through that as a Nigerian scammer telling you you've won them a bunch of

1428
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:47.570
money and his thoughts glowing up.

1429
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:48.760
Eh,

1430
00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.880
you get a telephone call.

1431
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:51.163
Exactly.

1432
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:52.453
Yeah.

1433
00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:53.031
So,

1434
00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:53.241
uh,

1435
00:34:53.241 --> 00:34:54.380
where did this originate?

1436
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:54.911
Who uh,

1437
00:34:54.911 --> 00:34:55.171
what,

1438
00:34:55.171 --> 00:34:56.270
what country started this?

1439
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:57.100
What?

1440
00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.840
Karate audio for this event.

1441
00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:00.471
No clue.

1442
00:35:00.471 --> 00:35:02.440
I'm going to meet these people face to face.

1443
00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:03.610
No,

1444
00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:03.671
no,

1445
00:35:03.671 --> 00:35:03.800
no,

1446
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.920
because I've been doing commentary and I met some people from the organization

1447
00:35:06.921 --> 00:35:08.150
because I did some commentary over.

1448
00:35:08.151 --> 00:35:10.460
So fudge together with the finished Carnavale.

1449
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:12.203
She's great.

1450
00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.050
She talks to on a lot of stuff for lion fight.

1451
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.153
I met her on her,

1452
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:18.140
her boyfriend in New York,

1453
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:18.350
Vic,

1454
00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:18.820
not,

1455
00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.010
yeah,

1456
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.530
not this last new UFC in New York,

1457
00:35:21.531 --> 00:35:24.290
but in the past I got her tickets for the uh,

1458
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.153
the UFC.

1459
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:26.090
She's excellent.

1460
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.340
Really good post fight interviews.

1461
00:35:28.341 --> 00:35:30.470
And she's doing commentary with you?

1462
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.890
Yes.

1463
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:31.550
Perfect.

1464
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.940
Yup.

1465
00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.170
She's very knowledgeable.

1466
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:33.680
Yeah,

1467
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:33.801
no,

1468
00:35:33.801 --> 00:35:34.360
it was great.

1469
00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.870
Then we pulled it off right away.

1470
00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:37.380
So that's why we met his there.

1471
00:35:37.381 --> 00:35:38.040
We did it in a,

1472
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.210
<v 2>in Long Island when I was filling me.</v>

1473
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:40.020
They're nice.

1474
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:40.853
And uh,

1475
00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.680
and so there was,

1476
00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.800
I'm going to shoot me man as well.

1477
00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:44.851
No,

1478
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:44.941
no,

1479
00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:45.091
no.

1480
00:35:45.091 --> 00:35:46.470
We just did it in my hotel.

1481
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.140
So you did commentary like watching it on screen,

1482
00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:49.974
is that what it was?

1483
00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.350
Queen had some people coming in with special microphone.

1484
00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:53.220
Shall we tuned it up?

1485
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.670
You know,

1486
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:55.920
he was exactly the same that a bunch of times for pride,

1487
00:35:55.921 --> 00:35:56.161
right.

1488
00:35:56.161 --> 00:35:59.550
Where you were in America and you were doing commentary for events that were

1489
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:01.830
happening in Japan and to have a lifestyle,

1490
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:02.340
we do it.

1491
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.290
The commentary right over life.

1492
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.303
What was that like?

1493
00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:06.120
It was weird.

1494
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:06.301
It,

1495
00:36:06.301 --> 00:36:06.631
no,

1496
00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:07.470
it's no pain at all.

1497
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:09.720
I hope that the speed was up to we know,

1498
00:36:09.721 --> 00:36:11.180
because if you see an buck coming,

1499
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.240
I that I never knew.

1500
00:36:12.241 --> 00:36:13.980
I never rewatched it again to say,

1501
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:14.801
you know what,

1502
00:36:14.801 --> 00:36:15.510
our Mars happening.

1503
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.990
I say,

1504
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.070
he said to go up and our bar,

1505
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:17.810
you know,

1506
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:19.370
if that delay is five seconds,

1507
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.881
10 seconds,

1508
00:36:19.881 --> 00:36:19.950
yeah,

1509
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:20.783
you have a problem.

1510
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.400
But I don't think it is because they stream it out.

1511
00:36:23.401 --> 00:36:25.140
They shoot it out from the studio.

1512
00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:26.850
So it's like she watching the fights live.

1513
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.420
That's it.

1514
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:31.740
It wasn't there some that you guys did where the fights had already happened and

1515
00:36:31.741 --> 00:36:32.574
you knew the results.

1516
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:32.731
Oh,

1517
00:36:32.731 --> 00:36:34.380
I did that with Steven Quadros.

1518
00:36:34.381 --> 00:36:35.490
We did the first 10,

1519
00:36:35.491 --> 00:36:36.181
I believe,

1520
00:36:36.181 --> 00:36:36.891
pride shows,

1521
00:36:36.891 --> 00:36:37.100
you know,

1522
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.280
before 2000.

1523
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.920
It wasn't,

1524
00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:39.450
uh,

1525
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.650
sent out on paper for you.

1526
00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:43.650
So they asked us to do a dose shows.

1527
00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:44.484
Man.

1528
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:48.090
I remember sitting there in Holland to a sitting with red bull.

1529
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.580
We at stack rumor that those spills and makes you,

1530
00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.770
she's crying.

1531
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.460
We were like heart attack pills.

1532
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:56.550
We were,

1533
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:57.480
it was so funny.

1534
00:36:57.481 --> 00:36:58.650
Quarters got so crazy.

1535
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:01.050
He's so hilarious when he gets in the zone,

1536
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.670
you know he started Sunday.

1537
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.280
I'm watching a fight and I hear

1538
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.410
and I looked at his side.

1539
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:10.730
He's eating a green apple phone.

1540
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:11.161
No,

1541
00:37:11.161 --> 00:37:12.960
but it's because this is eight hours in.

1542
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.590
We're watching really boring stuff also this,

1543
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:16.771
oh,

1544
00:37:16.771 --> 00:37:17.131
this was,

1545
00:37:17.131 --> 00:37:17.491
by the way,

1546
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:18.420
this was not bright.

1547
00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:20.280
We W W we did pride,

1548
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:21.660
but that we did on top of that,

1549
00:37:21.661 --> 00:37:23.700
we did not want to swell pride we did here.

1550
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.880
That's what we did here in America with,

1551
00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:29.820
but Brotzmann and the auto show we did in Holland,

1552
00:37:29.821 --> 00:37:33.900
but all these old crazy Russian guys who had like an a and an Ian name and the

1553
00:37:33.901 --> 00:37:36.590
rest was VP Sdrm z,

1554
00:37:36.591 --> 00:37:36.890
you know,

1555
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:37.160
I mean,

1556
00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.790
I would call him the guy with the red hair.

1557
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.230
Oh,

1558
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:42.690
the guy with the red pants because I couldn't pronounce their names.

1559
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.101
Yeah.

1560
00:37:44.101 --> 00:37:47.880
There's some guys in the UFC that when I read their names at the weigh ins,

1561
00:37:47.881 --> 00:37:51.450
I have to pause and try to put it together.

1562
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:52.493
Like some of them,

1563
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.710
it's hard now and you don't want to butcher them and then you have these guys

1564
00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:56.880
like defense,

1565
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.600
right?

1566
00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:57.900
They say,

1567
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.051
Oh,

1568
00:37:58.051 --> 00:37:59.670
you butchered so and show his name.

1569
00:37:59.671 --> 00:38:00.504
I said,

1570
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.051
what do you say,

1571
00:38:01.051 --> 00:38:01.621
bus route than,

1572
00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:01.801
yeah,

1573
00:38:01.801 --> 00:38:02.850
you just butchered my name.

1574
00:38:02.851 --> 00:38:03.750
Does as much of it.

1575
00:38:03.751 --> 00:38:04.790
Then it's not rude.

1576
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:06.520
It's not a nest or hoost.

1577
00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.800
It's an us to host.

1578
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.170
It's be the act.

1579
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.280
It's not been a bird.

1580
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.561
You know?

1581
00:38:10.561 --> 00:38:10.810
You see,

1582
00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.580
I mean if you really want to start Dutch,

1583
00:38:12.581 --> 00:38:12.990
we,

1584
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.430
we asked the federal one time,

1585
00:38:14.431 --> 00:38:15.600
what is your mother call you?

1586
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:15.991
He says,

1587
00:38:15.991 --> 00:38:16.500
Fyodor.

1588
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:16.741
I said,

1589
00:38:16.741 --> 00:38:17.574
we don't feel though.

1590
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:18.900
We did that on pride.

1591
00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:19.861
Everybody,

1592
00:38:19.861 --> 00:38:22.800
you're butchering his name as his mom calls him like that as well.

1593
00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:23.520
We asked,

1594
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:23.701
well,

1595
00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.680
Mauro was the only one that would call him that.

1596
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:27.510
Moro always called him fuel door.

1597
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.680
If your door is of a motto is very precise with that.

1598
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:32.340
Mara was excellent.

1599
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:33.571
He really is.

1600
00:38:33.571 --> 00:38:34.261
He's great at that.

1601
00:38:34.261 --> 00:38:36.040
It's so nice to see him doing all those big time

1602
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.120
<v 1>boxing matches too.</v>

1603
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.670
Yeah.

1604
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:38.130
You know,

1605
00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:38.963
he's a good guy.

1606
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.731
That guy,

1607
00:38:39.731 --> 00:38:40.240
if you,

1608
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.620
if you sit next to him,

1609
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.330
it's a look when people say,

1610
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:43.511
oh,

1611
00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:44.344
it's fake is this,

1612
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:44.861
trust me.

1613
00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:46.360
It's half that.

1614
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.250
That's what they say matters and talks boss.

1615
00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:48.820
Oh,

1616
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.380
he gets in his own bubble and then,

1617
00:38:50.381 --> 00:38:50.681
you know,

1618
00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:52.000
if I look at him it,

1619
00:38:52.001 --> 00:38:53.920
that I can put my hand in front of his face.

1620
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:54.790
If he's in the zone,

1621
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:55.900
he doesn't see anything.

1622
00:38:55.901 --> 00:38:59.470
He only sees the fight and he's going to town and everybody steps away and just

1623
00:38:59.471 --> 00:39:00.990
looks at him now he gets,

1624
00:39:00.991 --> 00:39:01.790
he's going for it.

1625
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:02.680
He's designed for that.

1626
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:03.220
Love it.

1627
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.830
He's doing WWE to right is insane.

1628
00:39:05.831 --> 00:39:07.660
He does every does WWE,

1629
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:09.220
he's doing showtime boxing.

1630
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:10.750
Does he do any MMA anymore?

1631
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:11.771
Oh No.

1632
00:39:11.771 --> 00:39:12.310
Uh,

1633
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.660
the ballot or what does he still do?

1634
00:39:13.661 --> 00:39:16.720
That I believe are doing a lot of the bell tours now.

1635
00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.340
So he does some of the Bella tours.

1636
00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:22.300
I think show the big show is problem because a lot of them,

1637
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:22.600
uh,

1638
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.070
Goldberg's doing now here,

1639
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.350
they've got a whole crazy team.

1640
00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:27.340
Darren and Jimmy was over,

1641
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:27.460
uh,

1642
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.880
to Yoshi chimneys with us now.

1643
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:30.850
I got him a Gig at the UFC.

1644
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.490
We worked together first time to Saturday night.

1645
00:39:33.491 --> 00:39:34.120
It was great.

1646
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:34.361
Yeah.

1647
00:39:34.361 --> 00:39:34.670
Good.

1648
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:35.261
He's a good guy.

1649
00:39:35.261 --> 00:39:37.710
He's a great guy and he's fucking excellent.

1650
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.740
He's an excellent commentary.

1651
00:39:38.741 --> 00:39:41.140
I tried to get the UFC to hire him four years ago.

1652
00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:44.710
So for me to be there Saturday nights sitting next to Jimmy,

1653
00:39:44.711 --> 00:39:45.250
I was like,

1654
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.083
look at this man.

1655
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.980
We're cool.

1656
00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.273
Yeah.

1657
00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:50.740
It was perfect too.

1658
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:51.880
Cause we're friends.

1659
00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:56.410
It's a very easy in the commentary flowed very nice together.

1660
00:39:56.411 --> 00:39:56.651
You know,

1661
00:39:56.651 --> 00:39:57.484
we had a good time.

1662
00:39:57.970 --> 00:39:58.511
That's what happened.

1663
00:39:58.511 --> 00:39:59.300
I'll show me tomorrow.

1664
00:39:59.300 --> 00:39:59.490
Yeah,

1665
00:39:59.490 --> 00:39:59.721
yeah,

1666
00:39:59.721 --> 00:40:00.000
yeah.

1667
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.340
You know,

1668
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.740
just his friends and you can't shake,

1669
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.750
try it out because it's just a conversation.

1670
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.111
Right.

1671
00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:08.290
Well that's why me and Goldberg worked so well for so long because we're so

1672
00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:08.780
tight.

1673
00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:09.730
It's so easy,

1674
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:10.743
so easy.

1675
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.530
But whatever the UFC and him didn't see eye to eye for whatever reason,

1676
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.193
it's a bomber.

1677
00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:16.600
Yeah.

1678
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.130
But I love Anna to annex.

1679
00:40:18.131 --> 00:40:18.910
Great Guy.

1680
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:19.170
Yeah.

1681
00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:19.380
Yeah,

1682
00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:19.571
yeah.

1683
00:40:19.571 --> 00:40:20.090
Notice that.

1684
00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:22.690
A lot of good guys and at what the fence should know.

1685
00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:26.330
Is that a play by play guy doesn't need to know everything.

1686
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:27.640
Doesn't need to know to techniques.

1687
00:40:27.641 --> 00:40:30.190
That's why we out at the experts to call or a guys.

1688
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:30.640
Yeah,

1689
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.840
because that's so many people that say,

1690
00:40:31.841 --> 00:40:31.961
oh,

1691
00:40:31.961 --> 00:40:34.330
why don't you take a a Goldberg plays?

1692
00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:34.720
I said,

1693
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.250
I'm a play by play of I'm a,

1694
00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:36.911
I'm a comic guy.

1695
00:40:36.911 --> 00:40:37.570
He's a play by,

1696
00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:38.730
it's a completely different animal.

1697
00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.000
You our gig.

1698
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.241
Yeah.

1699
00:40:40.241 --> 00:40:41.380
If especially for TV,

1700
00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:44.080
you got to go to commercials and do all that kind of stuff.

1701
00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.660
It's much harder to Anik and Goldberg.

1702
00:40:46.661 --> 00:40:47.560
Those guys are wizards.

1703
00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.400
That stuff.

1704
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.750
That is a hard job.

1705
00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.430
It's way harder than our job.

1706
00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.810
Our job of doing color.

1707
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.191
We see the fight,

1708
00:40:54.191 --> 00:40:54.760
we pitch it,

1709
00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.430
we call it,

1710
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:57.640
we do it and you've been doing martial arts our whole lives.

1711
00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:59.110
We know what's happening,

1712
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.220
so we see it.

1713
00:41:00.221 --> 00:41:00.461
We go,

1714
00:41:00.461 --> 00:41:00.761
oh,

1715
00:41:00.761 --> 00:41:01.690
that's a roundhouse kick.

1716
00:41:01.691 --> 00:41:01.871
Oh,

1717
00:41:01.871 --> 00:41:04.810
he's going to get the triangle always getting out cause he's free.

1718
00:41:04.811 --> 00:41:05.644
He's out.

1719
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:06.970
We're watching it in real time.

1720
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.410
They have to prepare.

1721
00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:08.921
I mean,

1722
00:41:08.921 --> 00:41:13.390
they're preparing everything like long and advance and practicing and going

1723
00:41:13.391 --> 00:41:13.781
over.

1724
00:41:13.781 --> 00:41:14.410
Okay,

1725
00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:15.610
turn to page seven.

1726
00:41:15.611 --> 00:41:15.851
You know,

1727
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:20.230
beat one 52 you got introduced monster energy drink and or they're stepping into

1728
00:41:20.231 --> 00:41:21.310
the monster prep point.

1729
00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:23.290
Dreaming into EHRs the whole time you're here.

1730
00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.190
It fucking hard.

1731
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.520
Fucking hard gig.

1732
00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:31.330
The coordination and the traffic cop and making sure that everything runs

1733
00:41:31.331 --> 00:41:32.164
smoothly.

1734
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.380
Check Kenny Kenny Rice,

1735
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:34.250
he's insane.

1736
00:41:34.251 --> 00:41:37.760
He does 26 professional sports like at the highest level.

1737
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.540
I mean,

1738
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.710
he had a football,

1739
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:40.461
they never did it.

1740
00:41:40.461 --> 00:41:41.580
My buddy calls me and says,

1741
00:41:41.581 --> 00:41:43.220
but how many times did you do football?

1742
00:41:43.221 --> 00:41:44.054
And so what do you mean?

1743
00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:47.200
He says he could be the best guy I've ever heard I,

1744
00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.250
and that is the first time he's insane.

1745
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:50.323
I mean these,

1746
00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.170
um,

1747
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.120
when he came to the international fight league,

1748
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:56.690
he never did mixed martial Samus but Moreau never did mixed martial arts.

1749
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.160
But within two shows,

1750
00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.150
it's insane.

1751
00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:00.710
But they learn moral.

1752
00:42:00.711 --> 00:42:01.770
Got The DVD set.

1753
00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.110
Can we get to the DVD set?

1754
00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:03.470
And they,

1755
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:04.670
and they actually watch it.

1756
00:42:04.671 --> 00:42:07.220
They start learning about it and then they get it,

1757
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:07.550
you know?

1758
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.971
So,

1759
00:42:07.971 --> 00:42:08.210
uh,

1760
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:09.043
and they leave,

1761
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:10.520
they ask you questions like,

1762
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:10.821
boss,

1763
00:42:10.821 --> 00:42:11.750
what should he do?

1764
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.530
Bosses,

1765
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.363
he in trouble.

1766
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.820
You know what's,

1767
00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:14.810
what's going on here?

1768
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:15.520
Yep.

1769
00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.140
Yeah.

1770
00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.940
Are you still doing it for a,

1771
00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.790
it used to be world combat,

1772
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:20.070
Lee?

1773
00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:20.421
I mean,

1774
00:42:20.421 --> 00:42:20.631
no.

1775
00:42:20.631 --> 00:42:21.870
What was the cause of fighting?

1776
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.480
Fighting and now it's professional.

1777
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:25.761
Are you still doing that?

1778
00:42:25.761 --> 00:42:26.120
Yes.

1779
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:26.690
June.

1780
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:27.523
We're going to start.

1781
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:28.341
That's nice.

1782
00:42:28.341 --> 00:42:29.270
And so they still have,

1783
00:42:29.271 --> 00:42:30.650
John is John Fitch and Beltre.

1784
00:42:30.651 --> 00:42:31.760
Now why?

1785
00:42:31.761 --> 00:42:32.594
Don't know,

1786
00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:33.980
I feel like Fitch,

1787
00:42:33.981 --> 00:42:35.390
mine just went to Bella tour.

1788
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.510
That will be not a smart move because they're going to come with a million

1789
00:42:38.511 --> 00:42:39.081
dollar price.

1790
00:42:39.081 --> 00:42:39.914
Right?

1791
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.630
If you win this season and every way,

1792
00:42:41.631 --> 00:42:41.870
Claire's,

1793
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:42.860
you're going to get $1 million.

1794
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.753
Oh really?

1795
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.210
Oh,

1796
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:44.661
no kidding.

1797
00:42:44.661 --> 00:42:45.141
So yeah,

1798
00:42:45.141 --> 00:42:46.120
that's going to be a,

1799
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:47.470
it was a nice little push.

1800
00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:48.420
I don't think the Joe,

1801
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.420
if that's 100% still in place,

1802
00:42:50.421 --> 00:42:51.540
I think the jungle was tay.

1803
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.281
I don't know.

1804
00:42:52.281 --> 00:42:52.641
I think,

1805
00:42:52.641 --> 00:42:54.460
I feel like John just went to bell tour.

1806
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.150
See?

1807
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:58.760
See if you Google John Fitch Bella tour.

1808
00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.300
I know a Benson Henderson,

1809
00:43:02.301 --> 00:43:02.980
Roger word.

1810
00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:03.440
Uh,

1811
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.480
obviously they have Rory Mcdonald who he's in my opinion,

1812
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.331
one of the best,

1813
00:43:08.331 --> 00:43:09.950
if not the best welterweight in the world.

1814
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:10.810
So that's,

1815
00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:11.643
that's a big,

1816
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.320
big deal for them to have him as this Douglas Lema.

1817
00:43:14.321 --> 00:43:15.154
I must sassy

1818
00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:17.653
March 1st.

1819
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:24.440
They must wonder Cheddar Cheddar.

1820
00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:25.250
That's true.

1821
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:26.061
He's got a big name,

1822
00:43:26.061 --> 00:43:26.470
you know,

1823
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.130
he out there.

1824
00:43:28.131 --> 00:43:29.830
It is John Fitch signs at Bella Belterra.

1825
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.971
Well,

1826
00:43:29.971 --> 00:43:31.310
John's 40 years old now.

1827
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:32.323
Right?

1828
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.193
How old is John?

1829
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:34.460
If you had to guess,

1830
00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.290
February 24.

1831
00:43:36.291 --> 00:43:37.580
It's a great day to be born,

1832
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.210
isn't it?

1833
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:38.421
Yeah,

1834
00:43:38.421 --> 00:43:39.254
it was

1835
00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:41.050
40 Banda.

1836
00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:41.720
Yeah.

1837
00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.380
Look at me.

1838
00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:42.651
I know.

1839
00:43:42.651 --> 00:43:43.484
Shit.

1840
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.321
I've been,

1841
00:43:45.321 --> 00:43:45.800
uh,

1842
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.750
watching John Fights and she was in his twenties.

1843
00:43:47.751 --> 00:43:48.584
That's crazy.

1844
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:49.401
Time flies,

1845
00:43:49.401 --> 00:43:50.000
baby.

1846
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:50.780
I know.

1847
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.600
Fuck if I go back crazy.

1848
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.640
I um,

1849
00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:00.020
I had a poster of you from the first time you fought in the UFC.

1850
00:44:00.021 --> 00:44:03.530
They gave me one of those posts and said the world's greatest martial artists.

1851
00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:06.500
And it was you fighting for the UFC when you fought too.

1852
00:44:06.501 --> 00:44:07.510
Sheeko Soka yeah.

1853
00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:08.330
Remember that?

1854
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:08.811
They asked me.

1855
00:44:08.811 --> 00:44:09.111
I said,

1856
00:44:09.111 --> 00:44:09.741
they messed up,

1857
00:44:09.741 --> 00:44:09.921
right?

1858
00:44:09.921 --> 00:44:10.940
That if forgot a word,

1859
00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:14.450
I told him specifically the world's grades looking Marsha,

1860
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:16.820
but they forgot that the word.

1861
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.681
Yeah,

1862
00:44:18.681 --> 00:44:20.120
they were hyping it up big time.

1863
00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:20.973
Yeah.

1864
00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:21.590
Yeah.

1865
00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:22.423
That was cool.

1866
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.380
What a time that was Peretti.

1867
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:24.951
Yeah.

1868
00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:26.750
He came over to Japan at the time.

1869
00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:29.840
I was fighting to check me out and he said they weren't you in the EOC,

1870
00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:32.310
so and just said something

1871
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:33.091
<v 2>online.</v>

1872
00:44:33.091 --> 00:44:33.181
I,

1873
00:44:33.181 --> 00:44:36.300
someone said something about me talking shit about John Perretti,

1874
00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:37.890
which could not be further from the truth.

1875
00:44:37.891 --> 00:44:39.450
Some guy who left a comment on Twitter,

1876
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:40.051
I was like,

1877
00:44:40.051 --> 00:44:40.950
you're out of your fucking mountain.

1878
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.870
Never said a bad thing about that guy in my life.

1879
00:44:42.871 --> 00:44:44.550
I love John Perretti and I,

1880
00:44:44.551 --> 00:44:45.780
I used to love his commentary.

1881
00:44:45.781 --> 00:44:48.180
Even when people hated him when they were sitting like we were saying things

1882
00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:48.391
like,

1883
00:44:48.391 --> 00:44:48.751
ride,

1884
00:44:48.751 --> 00:44:49.411
I'm like a pony.

1885
00:44:49.411 --> 00:44:50.580
He was riding something like a pony.

1886
00:44:50.581 --> 00:44:51.270
Right.

1887
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:54.930
He monks him like if he was great,

1888
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.730
he called it like you saw it.

1889
00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.091
I mean,

1890
00:44:57.091 --> 00:44:58.400
he fucking had a,

1891
00:44:58.401 --> 00:45:00.270
a deep background in martial arts,

1892
00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:01.620
world kickboxing champion,

1893
00:45:01.621 --> 00:45:02.910
black belt in Jujitsu.

1894
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:03.360
Oh yeah.

1895
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.193
I loved that.

1896
00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:07.350
And he would say whatever he wanted to say.

1897
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.490
He doesn't care.

1898
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:08.650
Yeah,

1899
00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:08.811
no,

1900
00:45:08.811 --> 00:45:09.011
no.

1901
00:45:09.011 --> 00:45:10.800
The fuck pull edition stuff.

1902
00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:14.490
Where do people get things sometimes and then it becomes like a some sort of a

1903
00:45:14.491 --> 00:45:15.324
weird rumor.

1904
00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.360
I didn't respond to the guy's like,

1905
00:45:18.361 --> 00:45:18.571
you know,

1906
00:45:18.571 --> 00:45:20.400
you should stop talking shit about John Perretti.

1907
00:45:20.401 --> 00:45:20.610
I'm like,

1908
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:21.010
why?

1909
00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:22.700
When ever we did this,

1910
00:45:22.701 --> 00:45:24.380
what did I do that you remember?

1911
00:45:24.381 --> 00:45:26.940
The Bosch would an invitational and we did it a long time.

1912
00:45:26.941 --> 00:45:28.230
It goes a lot of great fives.

1913
00:45:28.231 --> 00:45:29.790
Nate Marquardt oh two man.

1914
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:30.624
I mean Jens Pulver,

1915
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.820
everybody was under Scotch.

1916
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:32.191
I wasn't,

1917
00:45:32.191 --> 00:45:35.460
Colarado was in I think 99 something around that time.

1918
00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.490
There was one time he had a 16 men tournament.

1919
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:43.760
You have to fight for times and it Pulver alk shitty lost indefinable to a guy

1920
00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:45.270
who he never heard from him.

1921
00:45:45.271 --> 00:45:47.400
That was weird because both our became huge.

1922
00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:49.043
Anyway,

1923
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:54.200
Ron Waterman is fighting this out of shape out of big guy and Peretti is because

1924
00:45:56.281 --> 00:45:59.940
I got Peretti as the matchmaker because I knew if I have already as of the

1925
00:45:59.941 --> 00:46:00.660
referee,

1926
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.860
if I haven't met as the referee,

1927
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.750
everybody's going to come because they want to show off in front of the,

1928
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.680
the,

1929
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:05.890
the,

1930
00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:06.710
the UFC match.

1931
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:10.680
Trisha mentioned that j and then they're going to fight it out to an hour thing.

1932
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.360
The boss with the invitational.

1933
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.220
So he's fighting Ron,

1934
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:16.900
the waterman a goes to Ron water when he says this,

1935
00:46:16.901 --> 00:46:18.510
and this guy doesn't have a little skills,

1936
00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:19.320
you know,

1937
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.240
don't go to heart.

1938
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:20.580
You know,

1939
00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:22.200
could you please don't do too crazy.

1940
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.210
So Ron takes him down right away.

1941
00:46:24.211 --> 00:46:26.250
He's on top and he loads up,

1942
00:46:26.251 --> 00:46:26.670
had he goes,

1943
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:27.570
very gentle,

1944
00:46:27.571 --> 00:46:29.820
starts hitting him like the gentle giant,

1945
00:46:29.821 --> 00:46:30.720
like really not hot.

1946
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:33.210
And Peretti walks in and breaks it up and he says,

1947
00:46:33.211 --> 00:46:33.451
okay,

1948
00:46:33.451 --> 00:46:34.284
it's over.

1949
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:37.200
The Big island bottoms jumps up and he gets him ready.

1950
00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:37.981
Phage the quarter,

1951
00:46:37.981 --> 00:46:39.740
jumps over robe and get him British phase.

1952
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:40.101
And they said,

1953
00:46:40.101 --> 00:46:40.341
yeah,

1954
00:46:40.341 --> 00:46:42.000
like you gotta get his bull bull crap.

1955
00:46:42.001 --> 00:46:42.301
A little guy,

1956
00:46:42.301 --> 00:46:45.540
but everybody gets super aggressive and Peretti go suddenly.

1957
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:46.673
Okay,

1958
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:47.723
okay.

1959
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:48.050
You want,

1960
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:48.660
you want a fight?

1961
00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:49.080
Yeah.

1962
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:49.830
Okay.

1963
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:50.071
Okay.

1964
00:46:50.071 --> 00:46:54.090
We reached to fight and they restocked a fight and he walks to waterman.

1965
00:46:54.091 --> 00:46:54.570
He says,

1966
00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:55.560
do anything you want to do.

1967
00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:58.860
Oh No.

1968
00:46:58.860 --> 00:46:59.460
Oh yeah.

1969
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.470
Ron Waterman was a fucking goal.

1970
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:03.720
He was a gorilla.

1971
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:05.340
He takes the guy down.

1972
00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.413
He starts,

1973
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:08.340
he mounts him like a pony.

1974
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.400
He starts hitting him.

1975
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.280
Peretti looking in the audience.

1976
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.570
He's looking away.

1977
00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:16.800
When the guy gets hit,

1978
00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:18.120
he gets mauled Bong,

1979
00:47:18.121 --> 00:47:18.750
bong,

1980
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.870
and he's looking into the audience far away and suddenly he looks back.

1981
00:47:21.871 --> 00:47:22.140
He goes,

1982
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:22.800
Oh,

1983
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:22.981
oh,

1984
00:47:22.981 --> 00:47:23.460
I'm sorry.

1985
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:24.600
Break Rob.

1986
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.190
Stop funding.

1987
00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.740
The guys all bashed up and he walks to the corner.

1988
00:47:28.741 --> 00:47:29.290
He says,

1989
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:30.100
it's your fault

1990
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.880
<v 1>you did this and then you walk up.</v>

1991
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:33.450

1994
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:37.421
Yeah,

1995
00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:37.810
man.

1996
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:38.980
It was crazy times.

1997
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.650
I remember when they had that one just submission only thing and they had a,

1998
00:47:43.651 --> 00:47:46.330

00:47:46.331 --> 00:47:51.331

2000
00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:54.403

2028
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:27.851
Yeah.

2029
00:48:27.851 --> 00:48:28.720
Play this.

2030
00:48:28.721 --> 00:48:30.520
This was interesting because it,

2031
00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:33.020
back then these wrestlers thought that just be in,

2032
00:48:33.021 --> 00:48:35.770
Dan Gable was one of the guys that was doing commentary.

2033
00:48:35.771 --> 00:48:39.130
It was really fascinating because Dan Gable thought that if you were on the

2034
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:40.420
bottom you should be losing,

2035
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.351
you know,

2036
00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:42.940
they had that wrestlers mentality.

2037
00:48:42.941 --> 00:48:43.241
Well,

2038
00:48:43.241 --> 00:48:43.541
you know,

2039
00:48:43.541 --> 00:48:44.440
you took the guy down,

2040
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:46.060
Baba booey.

2041
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.650
That's hilarious.

2042
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:48.993
That a perm,

2043
00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:51.560
Gary Della Bhate is the fucking Rep.

2044
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.560
The ring card guy.

2045
00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:54.550
Look at that.

2046
00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:55.990
Kenny Monday tank.

2047
00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:56.621
Yeah,

2048
00:48:56.621 --> 00:49:00.310
Olympic wrestler and Kevin Jackson right behind him there.

2049
00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:01.721
Yeah.

2050
00:49:01.721 --> 00:49:02.410
So they,

2051
00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:03.250
they go at it

2052
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.040
and he's got his knuckles up,

2053
00:49:06.041 --> 00:49:07.300
which is weird because they're not,

2054
00:49:07.301 --> 00:49:08.200
they're not boxing.

2055
00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:11.620
So he's like trying to wrestle him and Matt Hume Barefoot.

2056
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:13.600
Kenny's weren't shoes.

2057
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.220
They'd Matt Hume.

2058
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.290
What a fucking martial artists.

2059
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:18.040
That guy,

2060
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:18.873
super smart.

2061
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:20.490
We want to coach to hazing.

2062
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:20.621
Could,

2063
00:49:20.621 --> 00:49:23.320
well you see it now and what he's done with mighty mouse,

2064
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.890
you realize what depth of knowledge this guy has.

2065
00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:29.050
Not to take anything away from mighty mouse.

2066
00:49:29.051 --> 00:49:29.381
Of course,

2067
00:49:29.381 --> 00:49:31.270
he's got a tremendous amount of knowledge too,

2068
00:49:31.271 --> 00:49:34.240
but the fact that Matt Hume able to take this guy,

2069
00:49:34.241 --> 00:49:35.320
so he just drops down.

2070
00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.393
Purpose

2071
00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:38.680
started working.

2072
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:39.201
Oh yes.

2073
00:49:39.201 --> 00:49:40.420
So he went for it.

2074
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:45.970
That's not a good nail against the guy who knows like wearing shoes.

2075
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:47.420
It's really stupid about it.

2076
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.941
Tap,

2077
00:49:51.941 --> 00:49:52.241
tap,

2078
00:49:52.241 --> 00:49:53.074
tap.

2079
00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:53.710
That was a,

2080
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:55.450
that was attacking the ankle and the knee.

2081
00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.420
That was both because his knee was twisted up too.

2082
00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:02.870
I saw John Logar and pancreas with a toehold broke his shin bone.

2083
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:04.230
Oh yeah,

2084
00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:07.620
I remember that.

2085
00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:08.530
Jason de Lucia.

2086
00:50:08.531 --> 00:50:10.090
I just walked into the arena.

2087
00:50:10.091 --> 00:50:10.541
I said did,

2088
00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:15.040
he just broke his shin bone and he walked back and he looked at me because he's

2089
00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:15.971
up next.

2090
00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:16.430
He says,

2091
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.560
well,

2092
00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.860
what happened to the word owl?

2093
00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:18.723
He said to me,

2094
00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:23.850
because Loeber just kept on fighting because you see the lack all flapping left

2095
00:50:24.861 --> 00:50:25.001
there.

2096
00:50:25.001 --> 00:50:25.600
Right.

2097
00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.010
And he jumps on his opponent.

2098
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:27.921
He was another,

2099
00:50:27.921 --> 00:50:29.090
he's another forgotten guy.

2100
00:50:29.091 --> 00:50:29.924
Kind of an animal.

2101
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.320
Yeah,

2102
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.570
he was the olden days.

2103
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:33.950
The olden days.

2104
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:38.030
There was some fucking crazy fights when you go back then and look at those old

2105
00:50:38.031 --> 00:50:38.864
days.

2106
00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:39.761
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2107
00:50:39.761 --> 00:50:40.451
I remember we,

2108
00:50:40.451 --> 00:50:40.920
uh,

2109
00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:45.640
we're talking about the [inaudible] at which Eve Edwards and these on the

2110
00:50:45.641 --> 00:50:46.570
podcast last week.

2111
00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:46.970
Oh.

2112
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:47.540
And what?

2113
00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:47.791
We're,

2114
00:50:47.791 --> 00:50:48.180
uh,

2115
00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:52.570
w w w he was underground fighting and I remember it was a tank Abbott who was

2116
00:50:52.571 --> 00:50:52.781
there.

2117
00:50:52.781 --> 00:50:54.310
I remember that they ended up Bro.

2118
00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:54.851
Okay.

2119
00:50:54.851 --> 00:50:55.780
So this one happened,

2120
00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:56.710
um,

2121
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:57.640
the athletic commission is there,

2122
00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:58.271
the police is,

2123
00:50:58.271 --> 00:50:59.104
they have to check.

2124
00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.950
So John Lobur goes into the cage with another guy with our jeans on and they

2125
00:51:02.951 --> 00:51:03.790
started wrestling.

2126
00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.640
So the letter commissioner,

2127
00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:09.250
the police sees that and they think that is what's going to happen tonight.

2128
00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:10.150
They leave,

2129
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:11.320
they locked the doors,

2130
00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:12.490
Dj comes on,

2131
00:51:12.491 --> 00:51:12.851
he says,

2132
00:51:12.851 --> 00:51:13.301
okay,

2133
00:51:13.301 --> 00:51:14.134
they're gone.

2134
00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:16.060
We can't fight ladies and gentlemen,

2135
00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.470
like people from port industry start throwing porn DVDs and the audience was the

2136
00:51:20.471 --> 00:51:21.430
wildest place,

2137
00:51:21.431 --> 00:51:22.264
right?

2138
00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:27.330
So he was fighting and he's mounting this guy and he sits next to the cage and

2139
00:51:28.721 --> 00:51:29.590
I'm standing,

2140
00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:33.790
I mean I'm a foot away from him because I'm standing next to the cage and the

2141
00:51:33.791 --> 00:51:34.280
cases,

2142
00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.370
occasions raised and he's raining down,

2143
00:51:36.371 --> 00:51:36.611
straight,

2144
00:51:36.611 --> 00:51:36.791
straight,

2145
00:51:36.791 --> 00:51:37.001
straight,

2146
00:51:37.001 --> 00:51:37.211
straight,

2147
00:51:37.211 --> 00:51:37.421
straight,

2148
00:51:37.421 --> 00:51:37.641
straight.

2149
00:51:37.641 --> 00:51:39.050
And they got eaves and he,

2150
00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:40.850
he stops by seeing and he looks at me,

2151
00:51:40.851 --> 00:51:42.250
I say hooked straights dude.

2152
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:42.771
And he goes,

2153
00:51:42.771 --> 00:51:43.670
hook straight out,

2154
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:45.710
knocked them out immediately.

2155
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:46.910
Not only straight,

2156
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.370
he immediately listened,

2157
00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:49.333
hook straight.

2158
00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:50.293
Not to get out

2159
00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.730
<v 1>the old days or good days though.</v>

2160
00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:54.391
Yeah,

2161
00:51:54.391 --> 00:51:54.661
man,

2162
00:51:54.661 --> 00:51:54.781
it's,

2163
00:51:54.781 --> 00:51:54.961
well,

2164
00:51:54.961 --> 00:51:57.750
it's amazing to be a part of something that developed like that because there's

2165
00:51:57.751 --> 00:52:02.580
no other sport where you go back to 1993 and then look at it in 2018 and it's

2166
00:52:02.581 --> 00:52:03.900
almost unrecognizable.

2167
00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.273
You know,

2168
00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.091
martial arts,

2169
00:52:06.091 --> 00:52:07.260
mixed martial arts in particular.

2170
00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.750
I mean if you look at what martial arts were,

2171
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.610
it was a lot of great Thai boxers back then.

2172
00:52:11.611 --> 00:52:13.230
Of course it was a lot of great kickboxers.

2173
00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:18.410
But the difference between the mixed martial arts from 93 to 2018 it's a totally

2174
00:52:18.631 --> 00:52:19.080
different world.

2175
00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:22.500
Completely different world in the beginning if you knew it all or you going to

2176
00:52:22.501 --> 00:52:22.950
win,

2177
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:23.460
you know,

2178
00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.140
but there wasn't anybody who knew it all back.

2179
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.340
Yeah.

2180
00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:28.200
There was a few guys that had,

2181
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.561
you know,

2182
00:52:28.561 --> 00:52:32.370
a good base of knowledge in some of the other sports,

2183
00:52:32.371 --> 00:52:33.930
but mostly they were specialists.

2184
00:52:33.931 --> 00:52:36.110
They were the wrestler or karate guy.

2185
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.983
One glove.

2186
00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:37.980
Yeah.

2187
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:39.810
Jimmerson Jimerson

2188
00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:40.890
<v 0>remember I,</v>

2189
00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:41.581
I remember,

2190
00:52:41.581 --> 00:52:42.230
um,

2191
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:44.970
Ken telling me about the event.

2192
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:49.110
They were in the back and they thought that they were still going to be a work.

2193
00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:53.460
<v 1>You know a lot of people and then the first fight went on and it was good though</v>

2194
00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:55.130
against the sumo guy.

2195
00:52:55.131 --> 00:52:55.964
When he kicked his teeth,

2196
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:57.050
he them into the,

2197
00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:57.860
into the,

2198
00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:58.700
into the crowd.

2199
00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:59.211
He said,

2200
00:52:59.211 --> 00:52:59.690
boss,

2201
00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:01.850
they got really great backstage and everything.

2202
00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:02.320
<v 0>Buddy goes,</v>

2203
00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:02.940
okay.

2204
00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:05.610
They thought that any moments until somebody could come in and say,

2205
00:53:05.611 --> 00:53:05.851
Hey,

2206
00:53:05.851 --> 00:53:06.121
okay,

2207
00:53:06.121 --> 00:53:06.721
you're going to have to lose.

2208
00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:07.554
You're going to have to win.

2209
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:09.090
At that moment that happened,

2210
00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:10.361
<v 1>everybody was like,</v>

2211
00:53:10.361 --> 00:53:11.440
why didn't they cramp that?

2212
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:12.130
I don't know.

2213
00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:15.370
I think there was just a couple of guys who did not like that Ninja guy that got

2214
00:53:15.371 --> 00:53:16.540
beat up by Pat Smith.

2215
00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:18.520
Remember that guy who was like a Ninjitsu Guy?

2216
00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:18.821
Oh yeah.

2217
00:53:18.821 --> 00:53:19.810
But the pressure point guy,

2218
00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:21.820
crazy shit.

2219
00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.350
Like in his like,

2220
00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:23.861
you know,

2221
00:53:23.861 --> 00:53:24.850
they had the preparation,

2222
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:26.050
they showed other prepare

2223
00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:26.590
<v 2>and he's like,</v>

2224
00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:27.240
ah,

2225
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:27.960
throwing guys out,

2226
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.700
hitting them with all this crazy shit.

2227
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.230
And then he got in there with Pat Smith,

2228
00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:36.060
fucking bad ass kickboxer and pat smashed them and they got on top of them all

2229
00:53:36.061 --> 00:53:36.361
five,

2230
00:53:36.361 --> 00:53:37.320
six elbows.

2231
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:39.420
That's where the blood comes back up,

2232
00:53:39.421 --> 00:53:39.990
right.

2233
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.111
Oh,

2234
00:53:40.111 --> 00:53:40.711
it was horrible.

2235
00:53:40.711 --> 00:53:41.311
It was horrible.

2236
00:53:41.311 --> 00:53:43.830
It was back in the day when they didn't just stop the fight.

2237
00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:44.020
Yeah,

2238
00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:44.331
but that,

2239
00:53:44.331 --> 00:53:47.720
that's the reason I didn't want to fight in the UFC and the first one when Ken

2240
00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:48.270
asked me about,

2241
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:48.461
I said,

2242
00:53:48.461 --> 00:53:49.110
we never did it.

2243
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:49.351
He said,

2244
00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:49.531
why?

2245
00:53:49.531 --> 00:53:49.771
I said,

2246
00:53:49.771 --> 00:53:50.604
I need a referee.

2247
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:52.020
He says everybody can.

2248
00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.520
They're the guys who say,

2249
00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:53.651
Oh,

2250
00:53:53.651 --> 00:53:54.870
I brought a dye indication.

2251
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:55.350
Okay,

2252
00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:56.071
good luck with that.

2253
00:53:56.071 --> 00:53:56.461
Not me,

2254
00:53:56.461 --> 00:53:56.700
dude.

2255
00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:57.600
I have a family.

2256
00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.130
I like my life very much.

2257
00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:00.000
I don't like to die.

2258
00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:01.921
I said,

2259
00:54:01.921 --> 00:54:03.360
as soon as there's a referee,

2260
00:54:03.361 --> 00:54:04.680
you could actually step in.

2261
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:05.190
Yeah,

2262
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.750
I wouldn't,

2263
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:06.600
I wouldn't like to do it.

2264
00:54:06.601 --> 00:54:09.690
There was a referee that was there when you tapped to stop it,

2265
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:10.800
but you had tap.

2266
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:12.240
But if you've got knocked out,

2267
00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:13.350
they just keep beating you up.

2268
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:13.961
You know?

2269
00:54:13.961 --> 00:54:15.540
And what John said,

2270
00:54:15.541 --> 00:54:16.740
because when John drew,

2271
00:54:16.741 --> 00:54:17.790
the line was,

2272
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:18.840
I believe it was for the tank,

2273
00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:19.820
Abbott take,

2274
00:54:19.821 --> 00:54:21.600
Abbott got beat up really bad.

2275
00:54:21.601 --> 00:54:23.730
He looked at the corner to throw the towel.

2276
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.110
They turned his back to him.

2277
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.850
Later on when he went to them,

2278
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:27.541
they said,

2279
00:54:27.541 --> 00:54:27.810
well,

2280
00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:28.890
if we would have stopped it,

2281
00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.090
thank was going to beat us up.

2282
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:30.960
That's when he told us,

2283
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:32.500
so that's why we didn't throw tolerant.

2284
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:33.720
That's the moment he said,

2285
00:54:33.721 --> 00:54:34.290
okay,

2286
00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:36.960
I'm going to just step in here because otherwise someone's going to die.

2287
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:37.710
Yeah.

2288
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:39.660
It could have easily happened in those early ones.

2289
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.660
The early UFC to kick the first gig.

2290
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:46.710
Durago dough we'll have on our lendo Veit oh,

2291
00:54:46.711 --> 00:54:47.930
the elbows and,

2292
00:54:47.931 --> 00:54:48.270
well,

2293
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:48.930
not just that.

2294
00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:51.420
We'll all remember all on him.

2295
00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:53.161
Took him down,

2296
00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:56.250
got him in a scar fold and just elbowed him completely unconscious.

2297
00:54:56.251 --> 00:54:57.030
Boom,

2298
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.720
boom,

2299
00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:58.171
boom.

2300
00:54:58.171 --> 00:54:58.991
Just kept hitting them all.

2301
00:54:58.991 --> 00:54:59.824
It was out.

2302
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:05.450
But Orlando like was one of the first real legit strikers.

2303
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:05.970
Oh,

2304
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.070
like [inaudible] fucking nasty.

2305
00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:10.490
Moyie Thai powerful guy and not a big guy either.

2306
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:11.610
Like 180 pounds.

2307
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.020
Halos,

2308
00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:12.580
scratchy,

2309
00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.321
hit some more.

2310
00:55:13.321 --> 00:55:14.580
So I forgot to Hippolite.

2311
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.850
Even Hippolite and Orlando would,

2312
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:17.693
I think they bought,

2313
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:21.390
they fought a whole bunch of times with elbows.

2314
00:55:21.391 --> 00:55:21.740
Yeah.

2315
00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:23.970
If those guys were fighting and Hollington y'all paid.

2316
00:55:23.971 --> 00:55:24.241
I'll look.

2317
00:55:24.241 --> 00:55:25.074
I got goosebumps.

2318
00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:26.101
We were there,

2319
00:55:26.101 --> 00:55:26.700
man,

2320
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.350
that was flying elbows.

2321
00:55:28.351 --> 00:55:29.071
I mean from to clean.

2322
00:55:29.071 --> 00:55:31.210
She would jump up in the rain down elbows to this,

2323
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:32.930
to the collar bones to the delta.

2324
00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:33.780
I mean,

2325
00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:34.060
yeah.

2326
00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:34.920
Complete animal.

2327
00:55:34.921 --> 00:55:37.080
He believed too because I went back and forth.

2328
00:55:37.081 --> 00:55:37.651
He would win.

2329
00:55:37.651 --> 00:55:40.920
Then we'd woodwind and he believed would when it constantly back and forth.

2330
00:55:40.921 --> 00:55:42.960
So that's why it was so interesting for us.

2331
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:43.381
Yeah.

2332
00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:47.100
If you're just getting into more tie now and you're just hearing about it the

2333
00:55:47.101 --> 00:55:52.101
fucking day we live in today where you could just go on youtube and find hours

2334
00:55:52.351 --> 00:55:52.711
and out,

2335
00:55:52.711 --> 00:55:55.800
you could fill the rest of your life just watching amazing fights.

2336
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.900
Really.

2337
00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:57.780
You can fuck.

2338
00:55:57.781 --> 00:55:58.051
Yeah.

2339
00:55:58.051 --> 00:56:00.030
Just find out about Giorgio Petrosyan.

2340
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:00.601
Just,

2341
00:56:00.601 --> 00:56:02.610
just Google Giorgio Petrosian you know,

2342
00:56:02.611 --> 00:56:03.444
who the fuck is that?

2343
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:07.270
The dual fuck is that you go watch Giorgio.

2344
00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:09.660
The doctor babies aren't real Italian.

2345
00:56:09.661 --> 00:56:12.160
There's only one in our Pelion right?

2346
00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:13.050
Armenian though.

2347
00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:13.660
Wow.

2348
00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:14.350
Yeah,

2349
00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:17.250
that Italy Armenians are fucking crazy.

2350
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:17.561
Yeah.

2351
00:56:17.561 --> 00:56:17.860
That's a,

2352
00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:19.320
that's a wild race of people.

2353
00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:20.701
But you know,

2354
00:56:20.701 --> 00:56:22.170
but he is okay.

2355
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.980
But the Italian side of him made him very

2356
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.270
<v 1>calculated technical.</v>

2357
00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:25.680
Right.

2358
00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:26.381
Because they're meaning,

2359
00:56:26.381 --> 00:56:26.891
would you think,

2360
00:56:26.891 --> 00:56:27.161
okay,

2361
00:56:27.161 --> 00:56:28.120
I'm going to go in here,

2362
00:56:28.121 --> 00:56:28.954
I'm going to catch you.

2363
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:30.850
And he was very technical as well.

2364
00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:32.080
It's just his mind.

2365
00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:33.940
But let's just record at a time like fifth 50,

2366
00:56:33.941 --> 00:56:35.640
four and a or something insane.

2367
00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:35.890
Yeah.

2368
00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:36.101
Yeah.

2369
00:56:36.101 --> 00:56:37.660
He got knocked down in glory.

2370
00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:39.390
He who's the,

2371
00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:40.810
he fought that African guy.

2372
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.561
Fuck.

2373
00:56:41.561 --> 00:56:44.230
I'm trying to remember the homeboy he fought.

2374
00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:45.370
Um,

2375
00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:46.203
somebody,

2376
00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.240
it Longo was,

2377
00:56:48.241 --> 00:56:48.601
who is that?

2378
00:56:48.601 --> 00:56:49.410
Who knocked him out?

2379
00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:50.280
I forget who it was,

2380
00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:54.510
but Georgia was so good with angles and technique.

2381
00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:54.901
I mean,

2382
00:56:54.901 --> 00:56:58.990
his technique was flawless and if you ever watch him drill you,

2383
00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:01.110
you recognize why he was so good.

2384
00:57:01.111 --> 00:57:01.291
I mean,

2385
00:57:01.291 --> 00:57:02.100
he was so,

2386
00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.860
so technical and precise in his drilling,

2387
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:06.210
but you see what he's doing?

2388
00:57:06.211 --> 00:57:07.170
He's punching him right away,

2389
00:57:07.171 --> 00:57:10.890
but she steps to the side is moving while he is punching,

2390
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:13.740
but he lands the punches with two feet on the floor still.

2391
00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:15.140
And then he moved that.

2392
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:16.223
That's perfect.

2393
00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:17.760
Perfect technique.

2394
00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:18.451
Yeah.

2395
00:57:18.451 --> 00:57:18.900
He's,

2396
00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:22.080
he's someone to really watch like Giorgio Petrosyan who,

2397
00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:23.100
who knocked him out.

2398
00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:24.090
So he go to his,

2399
00:57:24.091 --> 00:57:24.630
uh,

2400
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:25.710
it was a big upset.

2401
00:57:25.711 --> 00:57:30.240
It was in New York and it was when glory was promoting him as you know who he

2402
00:57:30.241 --> 00:57:32.490
was and he just got caught.

2403
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:34.770
He got caught by fucking vicious.

2404
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:36.660
Stryker was not a Dutch guy,

2405
00:57:36.661 --> 00:57:40.700
but I think it was Daniel Ilonggo and that's his,

2406
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.420
the Dutch guy.

2407
00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:42.253
Yeah.

2408
00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:43.100
Yeah.

2409
00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:43.920
Got Them.

2410
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:44.401
Yeah.

2411
00:57:44.401 --> 00:57:44.741
Wrist.

2412
00:57:44.741 --> 00:57:45.930
He's a beast to you.

2413
00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:46.800
You can find that fight.

2414
00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:49.900
So you find a Andy wristy versus um,

2415
00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:51.540
Petrosian Giorgio Petrosyan.

2416
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:52.723
Yeah,

2417
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.031
that's what it was.

2418
00:57:54.031 --> 00:57:54.451
That's right.

2419
00:57:54.451 --> 00:57:55.920
Andy risky can crack too.

2420
00:57:55.921 --> 00:57:56.820
He's dangerous.

2421
00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:57.721
Yeah.

2422
00:57:57.721 --> 00:57:58.350
There it is.

2423
00:57:58.350 --> 00:57:59.580
Right in Madison Square Garden.

2424
00:57:59.581 --> 00:58:00.710
That was a big deal for them,

2425
00:58:00.711 --> 00:58:00.960
man.

2426
00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:02.730
To get in Madison Square Garden.

2427
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:03.451
You know,

2428
00:58:03.451 --> 00:58:06.890
like to have that fight or de Vida Mayweather Darya.

2429
00:58:06.891 --> 00:58:10.290
Remember I heard they paid him a bunch of money to be there just to be there.

2430
00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:11.363
That's hilarious.

2431
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.140
How much did you have to pay him to be there?

2432
00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:14.220
I had just got to be a lot.

2433
00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:14.851
Yeah.

2434
00:58:14.851 --> 00:58:17.880
And Risk [inaudible] who was a great fighter in his own,

2435
00:58:17.881 --> 00:58:21.160
but Rusty's a guy who really good for a couple rounds in,

2436
00:58:21.161 --> 00:58:24.300
knew who he would fade and he lost.

2437
00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:24.820
Yeah.

2438
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.130
I forget who he lost to,

2439
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:28.620
but he lost by Tko because he faded.

2440
00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:30.090
He faded in the last round,

2441
00:58:30.091 --> 00:58:31.740
but it's the fast twitch fibers.

2442
00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:32.281
You know,

2443
00:58:32.281 --> 00:58:33.330
once your explosive,

2444
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:37.230
you're really good in the first few rounds and you're going to have to really

2445
00:58:37.231 --> 00:58:38.290
dose just uh,

2446
00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.770
make sure that you spread out.

2447
00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.173
Yeah.

2448
00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:43.050
All your powers.

2449
00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:46.620
But if your opponent is pushing it and it's forcing you to brawl,

2450
00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:47.010
yeah.

2451
00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:47.940
You're going to run out of gas.

2452
00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:49.760
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2453
00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:49.971
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2454
00:58:49.971 --> 00:58:51.950
I don't remember what it was that caught him.

2455
00:58:51.951 --> 00:58:53.210
I believe it was a punch.

2456
00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:54.630
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2457
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:56.370
<v 1>I got kicked in the nuts.</v>

2458
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:57.260
Yeah,

2459
00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:59.700
it was a little love tap.

2460
00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:01.043
Yeah.

2461
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:03.680
I remember what happened here.

2462
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:05.960
There's been so many good fights.

2463
00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:06.771
Glory.

2464
00:59:06.771 --> 00:59:07.430
Like I said,

2465
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:10.340
I'm a giant fan and I think it's one of the most underrated,

2466
00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:14.030
underrated organizations in all combat sports.

2467
00:59:14.031 --> 00:59:15.320
And they have a great,

2468
00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.870
like a library of all,

2469
00:59:17.871 --> 00:59:18.600
there it is.

2470
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:21.080
10 left hand boom.

2471
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.033
Caught him.

2472
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:23.030
<v 3>Wow.</v>

2473
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.863
Crazy,

2474
00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:24.401
crazy.

2475
00:59:24.401 --> 00:59:25.030
See Joy.

2476
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:26.510
Rewind that back for a second.

2477
00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:29.150
It didn't even look like that big of a shot.

2478
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:30.763
Look at this.

2479
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:35.240
Just perfect placement below like sort of a hookup or cut.

2480
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.960
Yeah.

2481
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:36.793
Yeah.

2482
00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:38.540
Like you stepped into it.

2483
00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:41.120
Switch to southpaw column on the left hand.

2484
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.460
Fuck a who did it?

2485
00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:43.611
Well,

2486
00:59:43.611 --> 00:59:44.460
let me pull up Andy.

2487
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:45.440
Rusty's I think,

2488
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:46.131
I don't want it.

2489
00:59:46.131 --> 00:59:48.830
It's wasn't trying to remember who beat him.

2490
00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:54.260
Somebody beat him where he was winning early on in any faded as the fight went

2491
00:59:54.261 --> 00:59:54.800
on.

2492
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:58.820
That's a Detrick tricky thing for those super explosive guys like a Conor

2493
00:59:58.820 --> 00:59:58.850
Mcgregor,

2494
00:59:58.850 --> 00:59:59.330
you know,

2495
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:00.163
it is hard.

2496
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:01.311
Oh,

2497
01:00:01.311 --> 01:00:02.144
to train our buddy.

2498
01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.130
Yeah.

2499
01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:04.040
I'm just throwing it out there.

2500
01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:04.261
Oh,

2501
01:00:04.261 --> 01:00:05.630
Yvonne Reus Molen beat him.

2502
01:00:05.631 --> 01:00:07.760
But I think von [inaudible] and beat him by decision.

2503
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:08.151
Yeah,

2504
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:09.050
but you see that's it.

2505
01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:09.510
Davi.

2506
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:10.343
Kiera.

2507
01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.633
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2508
01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:15.650
But also wrote small is known for his stamina.

2509
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:15.891
You know,

2510
01:00:15.891 --> 01:00:17.210
his father was already William.

2511
01:00:17.211 --> 01:00:20.600
You know who he was fighting when I was fighting and he's always coming forward

2512
01:00:20.601 --> 01:00:22.790
that William was not the most technical guy.

2513
01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:23.050
Right.

2514
01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:26.060
But do it the guy at heart and stamina and he would come for you.

2515
01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:30.200
And it's very hard to fight somebody who's constantly pushing you backwards.

2516
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:32.360
And that's what the he was doing as well.

2517
01:00:32.361 --> 01:00:32.780
With him.

2518
01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.950
100% makes them run out of guest.

2519
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:36.400
You're going to kill von Reus.

2520
01:00:36.401 --> 01:00:37.280
Smollins an animal.

2521
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:38.570
It's just like there's such,

2522
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.150
there's such a amazing pool of talent and glory.

2523
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.931
It was just,

2524
01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:43.880
it's an amazing organization to watch it.

2525
01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.070
So much talent and Wah,

2526
01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:45.590
Wah.

2527
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:49.000
I don't know why it's not catching on because what would he sees it?

2528
01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:49.311
Yeah,

2529
01:00:49.311 --> 01:00:50.450
but k one you would think,

2530
01:00:50.451 --> 01:00:50.781
okay,

2531
01:00:50.781 --> 01:00:53.580
all these people at least going to watch watches.

2532
01:00:53.581 --> 01:00:53.670
What?

2533
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:54.351
I would love it.

2534
01:00:54.351 --> 01:00:55.101
I love it.

2535
01:00:55.101 --> 01:00:57.320
But the average person go to fucking seven 11 and go,

2536
01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:58.070
hey man,

2537
01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:00.230
what do you think of Robin Bond was balling.

2538
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:01.131
Like,

2539
01:01:01.131 --> 01:01:01.941
are you talking about man,

2540
01:01:01.941 --> 01:01:02.870
you're trying to sell something.

2541
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.780
You go somewhere and say,

2542
01:01:05.781 --> 01:01:06.081
what do you,

2543
01:01:06.081 --> 01:01:07.310
what do you think about Conor McGregor?

2544
01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.030
Oh,

2545
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.960
he's really good.

2546
01:01:08.961 --> 01:01:09.800
When he fights buses,

2547
01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:10.311
you know,

2548
01:01:10.311 --> 01:01:11.720
people will say crazy.

2549
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:14.200
They know it's the UFC is

2550
01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.510
<v 3>very mainstream glory right now.</v>

2551
01:01:16.511 --> 01:01:17.590
It's still very fringe,

2552
01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:18.453
unfortunately.

2553
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:19.830
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2554
01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:21.510
It would have been greater for them.

2555
01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.860
Better if at the,

2556
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:24.390
if the UFC had a channel,

2557
01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:27.460
a TV channel like the WWE do that for a while.

2558
01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:31.080
That will be great because then you see glory will catch on for sure.

2559
01:01:31.081 --> 01:01:31.561
This right.

2560
01:01:31.561 --> 01:01:33.180
I don't know how many people are fight pass.

2561
01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:34.590
Do you know that a number?

2562
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:35.870
<v 3>I do not know the number.</v>

2563
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:37.100
I know they're very happy.

2564
01:01:37.101 --> 01:01:38.090
They make a lot of money,

2565
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.200
but I don't know the number.

2566
01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.370
You know UFC came real close back in the day to buying a channel,

2567
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:47.030
but now I doubt they would do that because they spent so much money to buy the

2568
01:01:47.031 --> 01:01:47.691
UFC.

2569
01:01:47.691 --> 01:01:49.580
I don't think they could just go by,

2570
01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:50.110
you know,

2571
01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:51.290
you want to buy a TV channel.

2572
01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.820
It's hundreds of millions of dollars.

2573
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:53.970
<v 2>Channel One is still available.</v>

2574
01:01:53.971 --> 01:01:54.271
I'd be there.

2575
01:01:54.271 --> 01:01:55.101
Fuck Oh really?

2576
01:01:55.101 --> 01:01:55.934
Channel and I don't know.

2577
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:58.380
It's never ever see anything on that.

2578
01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:00.120
I would get channel number one.

2579
01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:02.220
That's the same as we're doing a new bug movie.

2580
01:02:02.221 --> 01:02:06.450
I would double oh one that's what I would do one instead of double o seven he's

2581
01:02:06.451 --> 01:02:09.740
the seventh guy below one burst.

2582
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:11.083
Yeah.

2583
01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:11.411
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2584
01:02:11.411 --> 01:02:12.101
I'm number one.

2585
01:02:12.101 --> 01:02:12.850
I'm the original.

2586
01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:13.683
What those,

2587
01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:15.070
when you go back to like,

2588
01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:15.700
uh,

2589
01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.533
those,

2590
01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:17.590
those channels,

2591
01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:18.850
like when people were adding,

2592
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.040
when was the last time you heard of a new channel or the last new channels?

2593
01:02:23.041 --> 01:02:23.874
Like vice,

2594
01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:27.180
like the vice chair rail and that was like some,

2595
01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:29.970
didn't they buy maximum or some shit too?

2596
01:02:29.971 --> 01:02:31.500
I think they usually just switch.

2597
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.581
They switched the name.

2598
01:02:32.581 --> 01:02:33.410
Like radio stations.

2599
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:34.231
They switched formats.

2600
01:02:34.231 --> 01:02:36.000
Pretty much paramount.

2601
01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.340
The paramount network used to be spike TV.

2602
01:02:38.341 --> 01:02:39.150
Now it's paramount.

2603
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:39.960
Yeah.

2604
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.710
Yeah.

2605
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:41.460
Well look man,

2606
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:45.090
I'm just happy there's some combat sports on TV.

2607
01:02:45.091 --> 01:02:47.010
I'm happy the Bella tour is still around.

2608
01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:47.360
Like,

2609
01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:47.620
you know,

2610
01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.360
people would say,

2611
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:48.621
Oh,

2612
01:02:48.621 --> 01:02:48.811
you know,

2613
01:02:48.811 --> 01:02:50.340
you're in competition with Bella tour.

2614
01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:50.850
I'm like,

2615
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:51.960
I'm not in competition.

2616
01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:53.310
I'm not in competition with it.

2617
01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:54.144
I like it.

2618
01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:55.290
I want them to be around.

2619
01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:56.124
I support it.

2620
01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:57.090
I support all of them.

2621
01:02:57.091 --> 01:02:57.871
I wish there was more.

2622
01:02:57.871 --> 01:02:59.280
I wish it was more organizations.

2623
01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:00.270
It's good for everybody.

2624
01:03:00.271 --> 01:03:01.500
We'll fuck you allowed to get better.

2625
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.220
Yup.

2626
01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.053
It really should.

2627
01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:07.200
But I really wished it was one big Moitai organization.

2628
01:03:07.201 --> 01:03:07.861
That's what I wish I was.

2629
01:03:07.861 --> 01:03:08.970
Glory was Moitai.

2630
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:11.880
So use elbows and use the real full rules.

2631
01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.050
Elbows,

2632
01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:13.650
knees,

2633
01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:14.790
clench the whole deal.

2634
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:15.720
Let them do everything.

2635
01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.100
Let Fight Moy Thai style.

2636
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:18.510
It's the best style for standing up,

2637
01:03:18.511 --> 01:03:19.200
fighting,

2638
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:19.590
you know,

2639
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:21.030
and then put it on TV.

2640
01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.270
<v 2>Otherwise you have to,</v>

2641
01:03:22.271 --> 01:03:22.451
one,

2642
01:03:22.451 --> 01:03:23.051
you have glory,

2643
01:03:23.051 --> 01:03:23.381
glory,

2644
01:03:23.381 --> 01:03:24.214
elbow.

2645
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:25.583
Right,

2646
01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:25.961
right.

2647
01:03:25.961 --> 01:03:26.171
I mean,

2648
01:03:26.171 --> 01:03:28.710
you have special rules like they did in Holland because Thai boxing,

2649
01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.400
they did not do with elbows.

2650
01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.600
But as special events,

2651
01:03:31.601 --> 01:03:33.730
like he believed in with what I was just talking about.

2652
01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:34.840
They edit the elbow.

2653
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:35.890
Oh no shit.

2654
01:03:35.891 --> 01:03:36.790
They didn't use elbows.

2655
01:03:36.791 --> 01:03:37.624
And some of the events,

2656
01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.580
they did everything except the elbows.

2657
01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:39.911
You know,

2658
01:03:39.911 --> 01:03:40.580
that would be,

2659
01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:40.840
uh,

2660
01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.370
would be one fight on the cart.

2661
01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:42.790
Right.

2662
01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:43.440
They would do that.

2663
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:43.681
<v 3>Well,</v>

2664
01:03:43.681 --> 01:03:45.570
when you see some guys fight like,

2665
01:03:45.571 --> 01:03:48.030
like John Wayne par or like a,

2666
01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:49.620
here's a perfect Nathan Corbett,

2667
01:03:49.621 --> 01:03:50.454
perfect example.

2668
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:51.600
His whole things,

2669
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:52.380
elbows.

2670
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.380
And then he would fight in glory and they'd take the elbows away from him.

2671
01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:55.861
Well,

2672
01:03:55.861 --> 01:03:56.280
he's,

2673
01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:59.490
I mean he's obviously very good at all aspects of fighting,

2674
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:00.150
but he's,

2675
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.450
you know,

2676
01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:02.190
now he can't use one of his best weapons.

2677
01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:02.690
<v 2>No.</v>

2678
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:04.360
Was taking the headbutts out and uh,

2679
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.171
and uh,

2680
01:04:05.171 --> 01:04:06.340
you have sheer but Coleman.

2681
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:07.260
Yeah.

2682
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:07.661
This thing.

2683
01:04:07.661 --> 01:04:09.580
Remember trapping both arms.

2684
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:11.573
Yeah.

2685
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:12.250
Dude.

2686
01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:13.150
You couldn't stop it.

2687
01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:13.600
Yeah.

2688
01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:13.901
Yeah.

2689
01:04:13.901 --> 01:04:14.200
When,

2690
01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.880
when mark home was in his prime,

2691
01:04:15.881 --> 01:04:17.440
headbutts were a real weapon.

2692
01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:18.130
Yeah.

2693
01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:19.450
Did you head but anybody ever?

2694
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:20.343
No,

2695
01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:20.680
no,

2696
01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:20.840
no,

2697
01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:20.930
no,

2698
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:21.763
no.

2699
01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:23.500
I'll put my face in their fat.

2700
01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.790
Do you know if somebody loads up,

2701
01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:25.381
I'll write your,

2702
01:04:25.381 --> 01:04:27.640
my go with my forehead into his face.

2703
01:04:27.641 --> 01:04:29.670
I will keep this as close to hold tight.

2704
01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:32.900
I'll make sure my forehead is in front of your face and you're going to be all

2705
01:04:32.901 --> 01:04:34.390
my weight with it if they load up.

2706
01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:35.231
That's the fun part,

2707
01:04:35.231 --> 01:04:35.411
right?

2708
01:04:35.411 --> 01:04:37.210
If they did this and then at the last one,

2709
01:04:37.211 --> 01:04:42.010
would you just lead them so they had bought themselves in the face?

2710
01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:43.323
Top of your head.

2711
01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.630
That's all.

2712
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:45.463
Yeah.

2713
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:46.743
It works though.

2714
01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.370
We think that he will be distracted for a moment.

2715
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.521
Oh,

2716
01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:52.354
for sure.

2717
01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.920
Did you watch UFC Saturday night?

2718
01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:54.161
No,

2719
01:04:54.161 --> 01:04:55.340
I did not have no time.

2720
01:04:55.341 --> 01:04:56.530
I was flying all over the place.

2721
01:04:56.531 --> 01:04:57.240
Yeah.

2722
01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:57.420
No,

2723
01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:59.260
I had to go to an a and not a show.

2724
01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:00.940
Not a fight show in award show.

2725
01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:05.260
<v 3>There's this guy that fought on the undercard Zap beat Mageau Madge Sharrie.</v>

2726
01:05:05.261 --> 01:05:07.450
Poff Holy Shit.

2727
01:05:07.451 --> 01:05:08.284
Is this,

2728
01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:10.420
<v 2>how many times did to rehearse his name?</v>

2729
01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:12.340
Many of fucked it up at the lands.

2730
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:14.133
It was,

2731
01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:18.040
they were saying just call him Zabietska just debate and I might none

2732
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:18.873
<v 3>and I can get it.</v>

2733
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:19.430
Yeah.

2734
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:20.263
Yeah.

2735
01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:22.360
He's,

2736
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.890
he's fucking phenomenal.

2737
01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:27.100
He's one of Mark Henry's guys telling New Jersey.

2738
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:27.461
Okay.

2739
01:05:27.461 --> 01:05:28.294
That's good.

2740
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:29.530
From Dagestan.

2741
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.101
Okay.

2742
01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:30.251
Yeah,

2743
01:05:30.251 --> 01:05:32.500
that'll where there's just something in the water over there.

2744
01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:32.890
Yeah.

2745
01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:34.780
They just train with bears.

2746
01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:35.623
Right.

2747
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:41.190
But this guy is tall and skinny and he fought Kyle bochniac and this kid Kyle

2748
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:42.760
Bochniac,

2749
01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.460
like he was shorter.

2750
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:46.780
He had a hard time getting in on,

2751
01:05:46.781 --> 01:05:46.990
um,

2752
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.823
and um,

2753
01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:48.670
uh,

2754
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:53.110
[inaudible] had more skill in terms of more techniques and more things that he

2755
01:05:53.111 --> 01:05:53.800
could do.

2756
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.800
But God damn bochniac he's a fucking animal.

2757
01:05:56.890 --> 01:06:00.430
He is a savage cause he was there at every second of this fight,

2758
01:06:00.431 --> 01:06:01.180
trying to win.

2759
01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.170
Never gave up,

2760
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:03.100
never quit.

2761
01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:04.600
And end of the end of the fight,

2762
01:06:04.601 --> 01:06:06.820
the very end of the fight in the third and final round,

2763
01:06:06.821 --> 01:06:08.440
the last minute of the fight,

2764
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:10.590
he's pouring it on and he's got,

2765
01:06:10.591 --> 01:06:12.130
it's a beat up against the cage.

2766
01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:12.640
He's,

2767
01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:13.870
he's screaming at him.

2768
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:16.150
He's got fucking blood coming out of his mouth.

2769
01:06:16.151 --> 01:06:17.260
He's chasing after him.

2770
01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:19.660
This is the end of the fight was him standing in front.

2771
01:06:19.661 --> 01:06:19.760
Oh,

2772
01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.270
this is the,

2773
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:20.830
uh,

2774
01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:22.930
this show in some highlights of this all highlights.

2775
01:06:22.931 --> 01:06:23.764
Yeah.

2776
01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:24.610
Yeah,

2777
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:26.140
but it's a beat.

2778
01:06:26.141 --> 01:06:28.450
That guy is fucking talented.

2779
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:28.841
Like you,

2780
01:06:28.841 --> 01:06:29.674
what is,

2781
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:31.540
I think he's undefeated.

2782
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:32.110
That's good.

2783
01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:34.840
He might have one loss maybe early in his career.

2784
01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:35.800
I feel like he's 15.

2785
01:06:35.801 --> 01:06:36.520
And no though.

2786
01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.180
I think,

2787
01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:38.170
see if you can find this record.

2788
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:40.593
Does it say,

2789
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:42.101
Oh,

2790
01:06:42.101 --> 01:06:42.910
this is the end.

2791
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:43.750
So the end of the fight,

2792
01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:44.590
and I'm telling you,

2793
01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:47.080
Bochniac is getting his ass kicked the whole fight.

2794
01:06:47.081 --> 01:06:47.471
Never said,

2795
01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:47.820
look at this.

2796
01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:49.120
The end standard right in front of them.

2797
01:06:49.121 --> 01:06:49.954
Hands down.

2798
01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:51.370
Fucking 10 off.

2799
01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:52.540
Holloway.

2800
01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.490
The whole crowd going crazy.

2801
01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:55.990
This is my favorite part.

2802
01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:56.830
It ends.

2803
01:06:56.830 --> 01:07:00.490
The buzzer goes off and look fucking hugs.

2804
01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:01.331
Yeah,

2805
01:07:01.331 --> 01:07:01.900
I love that.

2806
01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:05.920
And they walk around the ring and I'm telling you there was not a person in the

2807
01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:08.350
fucking Barclay Center that was sitting down.

2808
01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.240
Everybody stood up and went crazy.

2809
01:07:10.241 --> 01:07:11.020
Me Too.

2810
01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:11.950
I was standing up.

2811
01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.830
The only time during the whole night I stood up and I was clapping.

2812
01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:16.120
You have to ah,

2813
01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:16.541
you know,

2814
01:07:16.541 --> 01:07:17.630
if they give it to y'all,

2815
01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:20.260
there's nothing cooler than that.

2816
01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:20.591
You know?

2817
01:07:20.591 --> 01:07:21.580
That's what the Holloway,

2818
01:07:21.581 --> 01:07:22.750
when he made that line,

2819
01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:22.991
you know,

2820
01:07:22.991 --> 01:07:23.824
he drew the line.

2821
01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.300
Yeah man.

2822
01:07:25.301 --> 01:07:26.230
And it became a thing.

2823
01:07:26.231 --> 01:07:27.280
Now 15 in one.

2824
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:27.880
Oh,

2825
01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.770
how's my memory is so good?

2826
01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:30.993
Is that beat?

2827
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.661
Look at,

2828
01:07:31.661 --> 01:07:32.494
try saying that name.

2829
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:33.200
Look at shows.

2830
01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:33.870
Pull that name.

2831
01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:34.181
Okay.

2832
01:07:34.181 --> 01:07:34.780
Is that a bead?

2833
01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:35.400
The Mughal,

2834
01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.500
they shut the door shutting puff,

2835
01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:38.733
puff,

2836
01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:39.650
puff.

2837
01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:40.221
Michael Mitchell.

2838
01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:41.380
He pulls a fucking animal.

2839
01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:42.611
Very,

2840
01:07:42.611 --> 01:07:43.271
very talented.

2841
01:07:43.271 --> 01:07:47.020
And Mark Henry's telling me about this kid a long time ago and he was telling

2842
01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:47.111
me,

2843
01:07:47.111 --> 01:07:47.470
he's like,

2844
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:47.801
he goes,

2845
01:07:47.801 --> 01:07:48.660
I've got a world champion.

2846
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.941
He goes,

2847
01:07:48.941 --> 01:07:50.140
this guy's going to be world champion.

2848
01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:50.471
I was like,

2849
01:07:50.471 --> 01:07:50.861
wow.

2850
01:07:50.861 --> 01:07:51.970
And Mark Henry tells you that.

2851
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.141
Yeah,

2852
01:07:52.141 --> 01:07:52.310

2853
01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:53.143

Was he fighting?

2863
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:07.983
I love him.

2864
01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:08.350
Good.

2865
01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.183

2869
01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:12.520
goddammit.

2870
01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:13.750
I'm trying to remember who he's fighting.

2871
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.040
I see his face

2872
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.611
<v 2>right in front of me.</v>

2873
01:08:16.611 --> 01:08:16.870
Frank

2874
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:17.970
<v 5>d</v>

2875
01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:25.140
<v 2>go to the UFC bantamweight division.</v>

2876
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:26.220
Frankie Rivera.

2877
01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.053
Jesus Christ.

2878
01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:29.670
That's what he's fighting now.

2879
01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:30.120
I remember.

2880
01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:30.600
Yeah.

2881
01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:30.901
Who is that?

2882
01:08:30.901 --> 01:08:33.990
Another animal guy beat Uriah Faber.

2883
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:36.420
There there is Jimmy Rivera.

2884
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.500
Why does say Frankie Rivera?

2885
01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:38.610
Jimmy is an animal.

2886
01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:39.150
Yeah.

2887
01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:39.751
Oh Man.

2888
01:08:39.751 --> 01:08:40.584
He can head.

2889
01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:41.730
I'm confused.

2890
01:08:41.731 --> 01:08:42.600
There's too many e's.

2891
01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:43.381
Too many reasons.

2892
01:08:43.381 --> 01:08:45.060
World Jimmy Rivera who beat,

2893
01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:45.923
um,

2894
01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:47.130
he beat a bunch of good guys,

2895
01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:48.610
but you should have stopped at 11.

2896
01:08:48.611 --> 01:08:50.280
Oh one of 15 in one.

2897
01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.620
[inaudible] you're ahead.

2898
01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.130
You must fucked it up.

2899
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:54.281
Yeah.

2900
01:08:54.281 --> 01:08:55.114
Jimmy Rivera.

2901
01:08:55.530 --> 01:08:56.310
Um,

2902
01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:56.950
he's a,

2903
01:08:56.950 --> 01:09:00.080
he's an interesting guy too because he's one of those tiger Sholmon guys.

2904
01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:00.390
Yeah,

2905
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:01.141
I was just going to say,

2906
01:09:01.141 --> 01:09:01.440
Yep.

2907
01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:01.801
Yeah.

2908
01:09:01.801 --> 01:09:03.300
When I was a kid,

2909
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:05.250
when I was living in New York,

2910
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:05.760
cut tied,

2911
01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.830
there was a bunch of tiger showmen karate places,

2912
01:09:07.831 --> 01:09:08.730
but we,

2913
01:09:08.731 --> 01:09:10.290
they were always like karate schools.

2914
01:09:10.291 --> 01:09:11.370
We thought of them as like,

2915
01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:11.671
you know,

2916
01:09:11.671 --> 01:09:12.504
like a chain.

2917
01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.393
It was linked chain,

2918
01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.260
but they developed legit MMA fighters.

2919
01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.880
It's like credit to that guy,

2920
01:09:17.881 --> 01:09:20.700
tiger Shulman because he really embraced MMA.

2921
01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:21.000
Yup.

2922
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.240
And they really develop some real top level talent.

2923
01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:24.721
Well,

2924
01:09:24.721 --> 01:09:28.320
once you're open minded and you know that every evolution is there.

2925
01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:28.621
You know,

2926
01:09:28.621 --> 01:09:29.454
look at Bruce Lee,

2927
01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.091
the book,

2928
01:09:30.091 --> 01:09:30.960
the Tao of vehicle.

2929
01:09:30.961 --> 01:09:31.590
No,

2930
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:32.970
you'll find tow holes.

2931
01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:35.310
He'll Luke's inverted helix knee bars.

2932
01:09:35.370 --> 01:09:35.551
Yeah.

2933
01:09:35.551 --> 01:09:35.850
I mean,

2934
01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:36.640
you name it.

2935
01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.520
Everything is in that freaking book.

2936
01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:39.300
That's amazing.

2937
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:39.571
Yeah.

2938
01:09:39.571 --> 01:09:40.680
I remember dying a death.

2939
01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:41.461
He,

2940
01:09:41.461 --> 01:09:41.820
uh,

2941
01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.030
was a game of death are interested.

2942
01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.720
It's dragging the opening with the crucifix kind of thing that he was doing

2943
01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:47.791
crazy.

2944
01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:48.180
Right.

2945
01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:48.790
Yeah.

2946
01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:50.610
That could have escaped that.

2947
01:09:50.611 --> 01:09:51.444
He could have breached that.

2948
01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:52.643
Sure.

2949
01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:53.993
But it was there,

2950
01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:55.501
but that's like,

2951
01:09:55.501 --> 01:09:56.100
you know,

2952
01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.390
some pro wrestling moves.

2953
01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:57.670
Yeah.

2954
01:09:57.670 --> 01:09:58.050
You see him?

2955
01:09:58.050 --> 01:09:58.560
Yeah.

2956
01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.080
That wouldn't really work because it be flexible.

2957
01:10:01.081 --> 01:10:01.914
It isn't that good.

2958
01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:02.773
Yeah.

2959
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.880
It was the adrenaline will make you extra flexible trusts,

2960
01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:07.230
then you're not going to feel the stretch.

2961
01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.500
What did you think about that crazy shit with Conor McGregor thrown the Dolly at

2962
01:10:10.501 --> 01:10:11.334
the buck.

2963
01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.061
You know,

2964
01:10:12.061 --> 01:10:12.361
I'm,

2965
01:10:12.361 --> 01:10:15.600
I'm giving a corner a lot of pastors and the only reason I'm giving them a lot

2966
01:10:15.601 --> 01:10:15.991
of passion,

2967
01:10:15.991 --> 01:10:18.210
it's the same as Mike Tyson.

2968
01:10:18.211 --> 01:10:18.541
It's like,

2969
01:10:18.541 --> 01:10:18.841
you know,

2970
01:10:18.841 --> 01:10:20.160
you're getting a lot of money.

2971
01:10:20.161 --> 01:10:21.790
You have the wrong people around you at all.

2972
01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:24.100
Everybody's a [inaudible],

2973
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.721
you know,

2974
01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:25.411
if somebody says,

2975
01:10:25.411 --> 01:10:25.531
hey,

2976
01:10:25.531 --> 01:10:25.851
you know what,

2977
01:10:25.851 --> 01:10:26.400
we should,

2978
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.790
we should throw something against the bus.

2979
01:10:27.810 --> 01:10:28.650
The whole gang is going to,

2980
01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:29.001
yeah,

2981
01:10:29.001 --> 01:10:29.611
and I just go down.

2982
01:10:29.611 --> 01:10:30.450
Sounds great idea.

2983
01:10:30.451 --> 01:10:30.661
You know,

2984
01:10:30.661 --> 01:10:32.580
I think he just got caught up in the moment,

2985
01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.271
you know,

2986
01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:33.841
be him,

2987
01:10:33.841 --> 01:10:34.770
tried to be him.

2988
01:10:34.771 --> 01:10:35.581
He can't go anywhere.

2989
01:10:35.581 --> 01:10:36.510
I can't pump gas.

2990
01:10:36.511 --> 01:10:37.320
He can do it.

2991
01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.660
Everybody recognizes he's got a lot of pressure on him.

2992
01:10:39.661 --> 01:10:43.200
I think he just has to figure himself out and it's going to be okay.

2993
01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.010
Deep down inside,

2994
01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:44.880
he's a good guy.

2995
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:46.230
You don't like him and,

2996
01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.780
and away with his family and his wife and everything that he does.

2997
01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:52.530
I hope he never loses that because that made him love him.

2998
01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:52.920
Yeah.

2999
01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:53.161
Loves it.

3000
01:10:53.161 --> 01:10:53.910
Look at it this way.

3001
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:55.830
Like Ray Borg was on that bus.

3002
01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:56.101
Oh,

3003
01:10:56.101 --> 01:10:56.450
I know.

3004
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:57.570
He got his eyes cut.

3005
01:10:57.630 --> 01:11:00.600
He got corneal abrasions cause kind of through that Dolly at the bus.

3006
01:11:00.601 --> 01:11:02.520
And I mean who knows what's going to happen to raise eyes.

3007
01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:06.930
See if you can find an update on that Ray Borg condition because he was the most

3008
01:11:06.931 --> 01:11:08.610
one of suffered the most serious injury.

3009
01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:09.330
Um,

3010
01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:12.370
Michael [inaudible] got cut on his head and his eyes,

3011
01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.950
but I think he's okay.

3012
01:11:13.951 --> 01:11:15.660
I think those are just cuts and he'll be fine.

3013
01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:17.070
But Ray Borg that,

3014
01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:17.311
you know,

3015
01:11:17.311 --> 01:11:18.600
you get a corneal abrasion.

3016
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:19.440
That's really,

3017
01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.670
that's really serious.

3018
01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.000
But what I was I say is imagine if the roles were reversed.

3019
01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.630
Magic Connor was on the bus and Ray Borg through a fucking thing here.

3020
01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:31.110
UFC Ray board yesterday showed a cut below his eye.

3021
01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:32.610
It's in his eyeball.

3022
01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:33.631
Oh,

3023
01:11:33.631 --> 01:11:35.250
Connor Mcgregor cat talking a bus.

3024
01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.150
Um,

3025
01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:38.010
he had a number of other MMA stars.

3026
01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:39.113
He and another,

3027
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:41.340
a number of other MMA stars are seated on.

3028
01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:42.360
So yeah,

3029
01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.260
so he's got,

3030
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:46.350
he's got some seriously re pour is only 24.

3031
01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:47.010
Damn.

3032
01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:47.541
You know I'm,

3033
01:11:47.541 --> 01:11:50.850
I'm when I was afraid of is that somebody is going to show him just like have it

3034
01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:51.551
with Russell Crowe.

3035
01:11:51.551 --> 01:11:53.610
We remember when he hit the guy with the telephone in his face,

3036
01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:56.290
they had to settle it for like six or $8 million because the Ottawa,

3037
01:11:56.291 --> 01:11:58.050
it was going to go to court and if it goes to court,

3038
01:11:58.051 --> 01:11:58.884
he's got a felony.

3039
01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.930
Can never fight in June in America again.

3040
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:04.260
That means for Russell Crowe could have never done a movie in America again.

3041
01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:07.050
Show we had to settle with the guy and you had to give him that money.

3042
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.690
That's a lot of money and guys probably balling right now.

3043
01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:10.330
Yeah,

3044
01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:13.500
it was probably right now sitting on a beach somewhere and drinking a margarita.

3045
01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:14.620
Go Russell Crowe.

3046
01:12:14.621 --> 01:12:15.391
Well it depends.

3047
01:12:15.391 --> 01:12:16.051
If he never had,

3048
01:12:16.051 --> 01:12:17.220
money's probably gone,

3049
01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.113
right?

3050
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:19.160
Yeah.

3051
01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:19.993
Taxes.

3052
01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:20.370
Hello.

3053
01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:22.920
My fucking fantasy had a beautiful fantasy.

3054
01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:25.470
This guy because his feet up on the beach,

3055
01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:26.750
Pina Colada,

3056
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:27.900
something with an umbrella in it.

3057
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.041
Yeah.

3058
01:12:29.041 --> 01:12:30.630
And it's all gone now and now he's uh,

3059
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:31.530
he's cleaning,

3060
01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:34.890
making shoe shine and then it's to make as money still in paradise because he

3061
01:12:34.891 --> 01:12:35.431
couldn't buy it.

3062
01:12:35.431 --> 01:12:36.150
Take it back.

3063
01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:39.060
What I was gonna say is imagine if the roles were reversed.

3064
01:12:39.061 --> 01:12:42.040
Imagine if it was ray Borg through the Dolly in it.

3065
01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:43.290
Cut Conor McGregor zone.

3066
01:12:43.690 --> 01:12:44.523
I'm not,

3067
01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:45.900
I'm not saying that it's good.

3068
01:12:45.901 --> 01:12:48.300
I'm not knowing that he didn't do it on purpose,

3069
01:12:48.301 --> 01:12:49.860
but I don't understand what you're saying.

3070
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:50.580
I'm just saying,

3071
01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.620
I'm looking at not Conor McGregor.

3072
01:12:52.621 --> 01:12:56.670
I look at what happened to him the last two years and that's a lot to deal with.

3073
01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:57.533
You know,

3074
01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.850
and I think he has to sort that out.

3075
01:12:59.851 --> 01:13:03.360
And I think the picture of this morning with his baby and his life was there,

3076
01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:07.140
you could tell on his face that he don't wash something.

3077
01:13:07.141 --> 01:13:07.680
Like he,

3078
01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.430
he,

3079
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:08.921
he was polite.

3080
01:13:08.921 --> 01:13:09.850
He was like a shameful,

3081
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:11.011
what's the picture?

3082
01:13:11.011 --> 01:13:11.320
You know,

3083
01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:11.791
I've seen it.

3084
01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:13.650
I've seen him go to jail.

3085
01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:16.230
It's entirely possible that they might put him in jail.

3086
01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:16.680
Yeah.

3087
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:17.850
That will be not good.

3088
01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.380
And because if it's a felony,

3089
01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:21.090
he's going to have a problem getting into America.

3090
01:13:21.091 --> 01:13:21.450
Right?

3091
01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:22.150
Oh yeah.

3092
01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:22.983
That's what I mean.

3093
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:24.300
It's a very dangerous,

3094
01:13:24.730 --> 01:13:26.470
what do they do here for his career?

3095
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.270
If he,

3096
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:28.320
he's got to settle.

3097
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:31.650
So if he settles with Michael Casser who already filed a lawsuit against him,

3098
01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:36.750
or we all already filed us some sort of a complaint or charges something.

3099
01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:37.081
Uh,

3100
01:13:37.081 --> 01:13:39.780
so him and Ray Borg for certain,

3101
01:13:39.781 --> 01:13:40.740
it's going to do the same thing.

3102
01:13:40.741 --> 01:13:41.670
So those two are caught.

3103
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.350
Everybody else on the bus,

3104
01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:46.980
every other fighter on the bus could sue for emotional damage.

3105
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.910
They can.

3106
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:51.870
One including rose thug rose was going to pull out of the fight.

3107
01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:52.200
Yeah.

3108
01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:54.330
She was really considering pulling it out of the fight.

3109
01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.380
She was so shaken up.

3110
01:13:56.010 --> 01:13:59.640
You know the thing I do leg of that he at least,

3111
01:13:59.641 --> 01:14:01.080
because when he talked to day to day,

3112
01:14:01.081 --> 01:14:01.950
he didn't apologize,

3113
01:14:01.951 --> 01:14:04.170
but he apologized for all the people who are on board.

3114
01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:04.381
Right.

3115
01:14:04.381 --> 01:14:05.910
He said no for the fighters and so short.

3116
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:08.430
So I'm happy he did that you,

3117
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:10.500
it's something you can't turn back.

3118
01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:11.410
He,

3119
01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:12.100
you can

3120
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.020
<v 1>make it right or you can,</v>

3121
01:14:14.021 --> 01:14:16.060
you can try to make it ride like a band aid on a wound,

3122
01:14:16.061 --> 01:14:16.661
but you know,

3123
01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:17.620
to give them all hell.

3124
01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:21.250
I would say give the game a little space and then hopefully he'll figure it out

3125
01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:21.940
and uh,

3126
01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:23.170
he'll sell it for those guys.

3127
01:14:23.171 --> 01:14:26.980
Some would say that the only way for him to really learn as to face consequences

3128
01:14:26.981 --> 01:14:29.200
for his actions and then if you just keep giving them space,

3129
01:14:29.201 --> 01:14:31.960
it's going to just keep pushing them needle and he's going to keep doing more

3130
01:14:31.961 --> 01:14:32.794
fucked up things like,

3131
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.940
no,

3132
01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:33.880
but that will happen now.

3133
01:14:33.881 --> 01:14:34.121
Right?

3134
01:14:34.121 --> 01:14:34.600
He's to go,

3135
01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.500
he's going to have to pay,

3136
01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:38.290
is going to have to pay her 100% guarantee.

3137
01:14:38.291 --> 01:14:39.124
He wants to settle.

3138
01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:40.270
He doesn't want to go to court,

3139
01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:42.880
but he's got $100 million and he made from that fight.

3140
01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:43.391
Never does.

3141
01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:46.060
He still and what the taxes and everything off I would,

3142
01:14:46.061 --> 01:14:47.260
everything he's buying adult,

3143
01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:49.630
let's say he's got 30 million left.

3144
01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:50.320
Yeah.

3145
01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.270
Let's say he's got 30 million left taxes,

3146
01:14:52.271 --> 01:14:53.081
all that other jazz,

3147
01:14:53.081 --> 01:14:55.300
what you really get versus what they say you get.

3148
01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:57.010
It is a lot going on there,

3149
01:14:57.011 --> 01:14:57.221
right?

3150
01:14:57.221 --> 01:14:57.700
Yep.

3151
01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:59.170
Training expenses.

3152
01:14:59.171 --> 01:15:00.010
Bought a house,

3153
01:15:00.011 --> 01:15:01.210
bought a couple of Bentley's.

3154
01:15:01.211 --> 01:15:02.044
Dot.

3155
01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:04.450
He's going to give out a few million here.

3156
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:08.010
This is going to cost them a few million minimally,

3157
01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:09.700
but Russell Crowe to hell thing.

3158
01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:13.660
Plus if they really were going to do this Floyd Mayweather thing,

3159
01:15:13.661 --> 01:15:14.830
they're not gonna be able to do it now.

3160
01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:15.761
I mean,

3161
01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:17.830
if he gets arrested or he is arrested,

3162
01:15:17.831 --> 01:15:21.550
but if he gets convicted and they wind up putting them in jail,

3163
01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:22.710
it's entirely lie.

3164
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:22.931
I mean,

3165
01:15:22.931 --> 01:15:25.240
he's got charged with assault mischief,

3166
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:26.440
a few other different things.

3167
01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.300
Even a felony charges that,

3168
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:28.590
right?

3169
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:29.140
Yeah.

3170
01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:32.950
I mean it's entirely possible that there could be some real serious consequences

3171
01:15:32.951 --> 01:15:35.140
for this and if they really were going to do that,

3172
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:38.920
but how many people would pay to see that Mayweather fight in the octagon?

3173
01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:40.121
He know,

3174
01:15:40.121 --> 01:15:43.040
but give us a little bit for this stupid rules.

3175
01:15:43.041 --> 01:15:44.530
His coach from the Mayweather fight,

3176
01:15:44.531 --> 01:15:46.720
it's like almost enoki when he fought Ali.

3177
01:15:46.721 --> 01:15:47.554
Right?

3178
01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.190
Just be four days and no more cakes above the way.

3179
01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.990
Normal kitchen above the waist.

3180
01:15:51.991 --> 01:15:52.721
She had no niche,

3181
01:15:52.721 --> 01:15:53.650
no grappling techniques.

3182
01:15:53.651 --> 01:15:53.891
I mean,

3183
01:15:53.891 --> 01:15:56.710
they shot at changing the rules just an hour or two hours before.

3184
01:15:56.711 --> 01:15:57.220
So.

3185
01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:01.420
So what would you like to see them fight if they might do it with nice knees and

3186
01:16:01.421 --> 01:16:02.770
elbows kill him.

3187
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:03.521
I know,

3188
01:16:03.521 --> 01:16:04.780
but that's what I want to see.

3189
01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:06.950
I want to go on it with,

3190
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:07.751
I mean,

3191
01:16:07.751 --> 01:16:08.920
even if there's no grappling,

3192
01:16:08.921 --> 01:16:09.271
Connor.

3193
01:16:09.271 --> 01:16:09.350
Oh,

3194
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:10.780
tell him it's just with kicks.

3195
01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:11.740
Just give him kicks.

3196
01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:13.840
We'll take his legs out and just don't get shaven.

3197
01:16:13.841 --> 01:16:14.560
Just low kicks.

3198
01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:14.830
Yeah.

3199
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:15.760
He'll take his legs out.

3200
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:17.140
All you'd have to do is just fight.

3201
01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:20.170
Do you remember when Rick Roof has fought that tie guy and the Thai guy just

3202
01:16:20.171 --> 01:16:22.630
kept his hands out like this and just kick the shit out of his legs.

3203
01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:23.763
That's all condoms.

3204
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.040
When you're gonna have to box him,

3205
01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.770
keep his hands out like this.

3206
01:16:26.771 --> 01:16:27.604
Whack,

3207
01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:28.310
whack,

3208
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:29.111
couple of those.

3209
01:16:29.111 --> 01:16:32.290
And you see Floyd limping around and next thing you know the head kicks comment,

3210
01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:32.740
boom.

3211
01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:32.921
Yeah.

3212
01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:33.161
Okay.

3213
01:16:33.161 --> 01:16:34.780
But let's say the heck gigs not allowed.

3214
01:16:34.781 --> 01:16:36.330
Let's say they do the rules like that.

3215
01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:39.670
A Antonio [inaudible] first as Ali stop.

3216
01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.513
That's what I mean.

3217
01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:42.760
I would do,

3218
01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:43.593
yeah,

3219
01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:44.980
that will be a good one.

3220
01:16:44.981 --> 01:16:45.251
You know,

3221
01:16:45.251 --> 01:16:47.020
show he's the next two weeks.

3222
01:16:47.021 --> 01:16:48.880
Every time he goes to the restroom and just going to go,

3223
01:16:48.881 --> 01:16:50.310
oh darn it.

3224
01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.273
Two Weeks

3225
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:53.463
Aldo.

3226
01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:55.100
I guess you were a failure.

3227
01:16:55.330 --> 01:16:56.163
Oh,

3228
01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:57.320
raises like if you have a scene,

3229
01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:01.060
Uriah was taking pictures when he was going into the hyperbaric chamber to try

3230
01:17:01.061 --> 01:17:04.960
to heal up the leg and his leg was giant purple blotch.

3231
01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.850
Like it was twice the size of his other leg.

3232
01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:07.100
Yeah.

3233
01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:12.100
Give me find it that your Ira Faber's leg after a Aldo fight.

3234
01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:14.160
Yeah.

3235
01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:14.860
Who was all doe?

3236
01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:15.650
Gonna fight.

3237
01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:16.550
He's fighting someone.

3238
01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:16.941
Oh,

3239
01:17:16.941 --> 01:17:18.260
Jeremy Stephens.

3240
01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:19.723
Oh,

3241
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:20.990
well you'll have to look it up.

3242
01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.100
It's like,

3243
01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:23.900
oh my God,

3244
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.930
that is fucking crazy.

3245
01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:28.281
That is,

3246
01:17:28.281 --> 01:17:28.721
fuck you.

3247
01:17:28.721 --> 01:17:29.090
Fuck.

3248
01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:29.870
First of all,

3249
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:32.450
you're Riaa favor is a goddamn animal.

3250
01:17:32.670 --> 01:17:34.700
This so Todd belief,

3251
01:17:34.701 --> 01:17:37.010
because it started early in the fight already.

3252
01:17:37.011 --> 01:17:39.110
Any Jess kept hanging in there.

3253
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:39.351
Yeah,

3254
01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:40.180
he wouldn't give up.

3255
01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:41.013
He wouldn't give up.

3256
01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:41.600
Oh,

3257
01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:41.931
I mean,

3258
01:17:41.931 --> 01:17:42.764
it was amazing.

3259
01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:46.910
Amazing that he made it to the end of the round or the end of the flight fight.

3260
01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:47.300
Yeah.

3261
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:47.870
I mean,

3262
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:52.340
although it's just taking that leg out and then I remember I was interviewing

3263
01:17:52.341 --> 01:17:53.420
your riot after the fight.

3264
01:17:53.421 --> 01:17:54.470
He could barely stand up.

3265
01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:56.180
He could barely just talk.

3266
01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:57.530
He was in such pain.

3267
01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.600
But respect for that guy.

3268
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.620
That guy is tough as shit that is painted that moment the next day.

3269
01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:05.413
And when Jimmy,

3270
01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.550
when Jimmy Rivera beat Uriah,

3271
01:18:07.551 --> 01:18:09.220
he beat him with that low leg kick.

3272
01:18:09.221 --> 01:18:10.700
He fucked up your eyes leg.

3273
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:12.470
A lot of times that happens with guys.

3274
01:18:12.471 --> 01:18:15.770
They get that low leg kick and then the nerves give out their foot.

3275
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:16.671
It doesn't work.

3276
01:18:16.671 --> 01:18:17.000
Right.

3277
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.920
That happens to a bunch of guys.

3278
01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:22.340
They get hit with that low leg kick and then the nerves just stop working.

3279
01:18:22.341 --> 01:18:23.174
Right.

3280
01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:24.260
Yeah.

3281
01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:26.680
I think that's a more dangerous cake almost then.

3282
01:18:26.710 --> 01:18:27.530
Then a low kick,

3283
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.861
you know,

3284
01:18:27.861 --> 01:18:30.620
because she actually can break a bone there with the cake.

3285
01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:31.121
Sure.

3286
01:18:31.121 --> 01:18:34.100
Especially if you hit the thick part of your Shin against that little cause it

3287
01:18:34.101 --> 01:18:36.180
the Fibula Tibia and fibia.

3288
01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:37.130
Yeah,

3289
01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:38.600
the fabulous a little tiny thing.

3290
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:39.091
Yeah.

3291
01:18:39.091 --> 01:18:41.250
Then that's not designed for kicks.

3292
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:43.610
Shitty design.

3293
01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:47.240
The human bones if is a shit designed your hand.

3294
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:50.660
It's a shit design for a guy who punches as hard as you write and it's crazy.

3295
01:18:50.661 --> 01:18:50.961
Yeah.

3296
01:18:50.961 --> 01:18:51.250
And I,

3297
01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:51.711
you know,

3298
01:18:51.711 --> 01:18:52.430
I should have,

3299
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:53.870
I shouldn't have put taken off the glove.

3300
01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.150
Definitely chicken them.

3301
01:18:55.151 --> 01:18:57.500
Cause these gloves are fucking awesome man.

3302
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:58.490
These gloves are good.

3303
01:18:58.530 --> 01:19:01.850
I mean the only thing about these gloves is there may be too good.

3304
01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.750
Like there's a lot of padding there that's,

3305
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:04.820
that's very thick.

3306
01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:05.870
Like especially where the,

3307
01:19:06.170 --> 01:19:09.110
where the knuckles car like right here that is thick as shit.

3308
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:11.810
That's like solid inch plus of padding.

3309
01:19:11.811 --> 01:19:12.710
Maybe even more.

3310
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:13.753
Yeah.

3311
01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:17.750
I mean I like it as a very even cushion.

3312
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.591
Right?

3313
01:19:18.591 --> 01:19:18.890
Yeah.

3314
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:19.760
You don't see that a lot though.

3315
01:19:19.770 --> 01:19:21.370
Sometimes you just push straight through.

3316
01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:22.310
But this is really,

3317
01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.520
well certainly for the back of your hands and even protect your hands better

3318
01:19:25.521 --> 01:19:26.780
than the UFC gloves.

3319
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:29.240
I think prod gloves for the best for,

3320
01:19:29.241 --> 01:19:30.710
for MMA or big though.

3321
01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:31.130
But uh,

3322
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:32.160
it will cool with uh,

3323
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:32.571
yeah,

3324
01:19:32.571 --> 01:19:34.370
they curve hence weren't open.

3325
01:19:34.371 --> 01:19:37.400
And even with the thumb and it didn't stop the grappling.

3326
01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:38.150
If you,

3327
01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:39.980
you're a smart guy and you're creative.

3328
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:43.280
You ever thought about redesigning boxing or MMA gloves,

3329
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:45.320
making something where people don't poke each other?

3330
01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:46.173
You just think,

3331
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:47.540
yeah,

3332
01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:48.080
no,

3333
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.720
I think people should just simply in a Po because why would you have your hands

3334
01:19:50.721 --> 01:19:51.260
open?

3335
01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:51.561
I mean,

3336
01:19:51.561 --> 01:19:53.600
you should as a fight or if it's your profession,

3337
01:19:53.601 --> 01:19:54.990
you should be able to not to poke somebody.

3338
01:19:54.991 --> 01:19:55.190
I'm like,

3339
01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:55.700
come on now.

3340
01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.210
What do you think about this proposition?

3341
01:19:57.211 --> 01:19:58.490
Because a lot of people been talking about this,

3342
01:19:58.491 --> 01:19:59.270
me included.

3343
01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:00.740
Every time you do a foul,

3344
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:03.140
whether it's an eye poke or a low kick to the nuts,

3345
01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.660
you get a point taken away whether you meant to do it or not.

3346
01:20:05.690 --> 01:20:07.350
You grabbed the fence point taken away.

3347
01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:08.130
So

3348
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:12.000
<v 3>this way there's no warnings and you never do it because you're always worried.</v>

3349
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:12.740
<v 2>Well,</v>

3350
01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:14.470
you've got to get better a lot in the beginning,

3351
01:20:14.471 --> 01:20:16.720
but once you realize that everybody's going to get penalized.

3352
01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:16.850
Yeah,

3353
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:17.531
you'll stop.

3354
01:20:17.531 --> 01:20:18.221
So it is,

3355
01:20:18.221 --> 01:20:18.640
you know,

3356
01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.250
it's like giving a pedophile to life.

3357
01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:21.460
Her sends her death penalty.

3358
01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:24.280
That will stop that disease for 90% as well.

3359
01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.353
Just get rid of him.

3360
01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:27.040
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

3361
01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:27.730
Um,

3362
01:20:27.730 --> 01:20:29.680
I think they should stop with the cage.

3363
01:20:29.710 --> 01:20:31.750
I think the cage is a bad environment.

3364
01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:36.010
I think it's too easy for guys to trap people up against the cage.

3365
01:20:36.370 --> 01:20:37.960
It's hard for people to see.

3366
01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:39.580
It's hard for the audience to see.

3367
01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:41.620
I don't think there's a benefit in the cage.

3368
01:20:41.621 --> 01:20:43.900
I think the cage was fun in the beginning because it was crazy.

3369
01:20:43.901 --> 01:20:44.950
Like you can't leave.

3370
01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.270
You're trapped in the cage,

3371
01:20:46.570 --> 01:20:48.580
but no one wants to leave.

3372
01:20:48.670 --> 01:20:49.420
They want to fight.

3373
01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:49.810
Right.

3374
01:20:49.810 --> 01:20:50.800
So if they're going to fight,

3375
01:20:50.801 --> 01:20:51.634
like that's not the best.

3376
01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.830
The best environment for fighting.

3377
01:20:53.831 --> 01:20:56.230
The best environment for fighting is like an open area.

3378
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:58.040
<v 2>The area that you know,</v>

3379
01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:58.360
good,

3380
01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:58.560
good,

3381
01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:58.830
cry,

3382
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:59.400
combat has,

3383
01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.470
it's a nice area,

3384
01:21:00.471 --> 01:21:01.304
but it is.

3385
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:02.323
See everything.

3386
01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:03.081
Plus,

3387
01:21:03.081 --> 01:21:03.321
you know,

3388
01:21:03.321 --> 01:21:04.340
with the holes.

3389
01:21:04.341 --> 01:21:06.220
I liked the voles because she can't lean against them.

3390
01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:06.780
You do that,

3391
01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:10.010
you're on your back and you're grounded opponent because they pull you back to

3392
01:21:10.011 --> 01:21:13.340
the ground because it karate company when you were against the wall,

3393
01:21:13.341 --> 01:21:13.971
you're not grounded.

3394
01:21:13.971 --> 01:21:15.230
But if they pull you once you were on the,

3395
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.891
on your back,

3396
01:21:15.891 --> 01:21:16.640
on the ground,

3397
01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:17.690
you are and you can get hit.

3398
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.580
Yeah.

3399
01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:19.990
<v 3>You can't get away.</v>

3400
01:21:19.991 --> 01:21:21.220
You can't run away.

3401
01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:21.620
No,

3402
01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.410
it's not like you run out into the audience.

3403
01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:24.640
You would have to go up that ramp,

3404
01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:25.541
but you're,

3405
01:21:25.541 --> 01:21:26.770
you're contained in the area,

3406
01:21:26.771 --> 01:21:31.090
but you're not trapped up against a wall like you are at the UFC with the case.

3407
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.590
<v 2>Each,</v>

3408
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:33.960
there were going to do a bit all the way in the beginning.

3409
01:21:33.961 --> 01:21:36.530
Right when they were talking about it with Emilia says,

3410
01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:36.931
wait a minute,

3411
01:21:36.931 --> 01:21:37.764
didn't John

3412
01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:39.900
<v 3>didn't Frank Shamrock do that?</v>

3413
01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:41.820
Frank shamrock had something,

3414
01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:43.170
um,

3415
01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:45.480
that he did shoot.

3416
01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:49.560
Did he call it shoot box frank shamrock shoot box?

3417
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:53.700
I feel like frank shamrock did something like this where he had,

3418
01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:58.730
and then Bob Meyrowitz came back and did something called the up hit fighting.

3419
01:21:59.690 --> 01:21:59.960
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

3420
01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:00.680
I remember that.

3421
01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:00.801
Yeah.

3422
01:22:00.801 --> 01:22:02.090
It was a crush similar,

3423
01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.260
something like that.

3424
01:22:03.261 --> 01:22:03.710
Yeah.

3425
01:22:03.710 --> 01:22:04.460
Yeah.

3426
01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:07.150
But that was in the cage to our,

3427
01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.490
David came to us to promote arm wrestling with where you could hit your

3428
01:22:10.491 --> 01:22:11.324
opponents.

3429
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:13.011
That's right.

3430
01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:15.410
Your arms are tied up and due to a wail on each other.

3431
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:16.161
Oh my God.

3432
01:22:16.161 --> 01:22:18.140
That was the most ridiculous shit ever.

3433
01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.600
I forgot about that one.

3434
01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:22.190
I forgot about that.

3435
01:22:22.191 --> 01:22:26.030
One guys had their arms taped up taste together and then they were punching each

3436
01:22:26.031 --> 01:22:26.864
other in the head.

3437
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:28.070
What the fuck was that called?

3438
01:22:28.071 --> 01:22:29.700
Extreme arm wrestling or something.

3439
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:31.221
I mean,

3440
01:22:31.221 --> 01:22:34.340
any name is good for that because that shit was so stupid.

3441
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.971
It didn't.

3442
01:22:34.971 --> 01:22:37.160
A couple of MMA fighters get involved in that too.

3443
01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:37.950
I,

3444
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:39.290
I'm pretty sure you know,

3445
01:22:39.291 --> 01:22:41.790
if there were not on the lists of,

3446
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.661
what is this?

3447
01:22:44.661 --> 01:22:45.381
What does it call?

3448
01:22:45.381 --> 01:22:46.214
Here we go.

3449
01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:47.391
Yeah.

3450
01:22:47.391 --> 01:22:48.590
They tape each other.

3451
01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:51.350
Ex ex arm.

3452
01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:53.500
Extremely extreme.

3453
01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:56.260
He's got a glove to,

3454
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:57.350
oh my God,

3455
01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:01.540
but as soon as you let go of that thing that you're holding in order,

3456
01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.370
then you don't have that balance.

3457
01:23:03.371 --> 01:23:03.951
You have to,

3458
01:23:03.951 --> 01:23:04.731
if you're right handed,

3459
01:23:04.731 --> 01:23:05.610
you're going to to put you your there.

3460
01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:08.351
<v 3>Oh my God,</v>

3461
01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:09.730
this is so stupid.

3462
01:23:09.731 --> 01:23:10.670
This is sold.

3463
01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:13.180
They simply pushing down and when the fight like that,

3464
01:23:13.181 --> 01:23:13.321
right.

3465
01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:15.100
This is so fucking stupid.

3466
01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:16.050
This isn't,

3467
01:23:16.050 --> 01:23:19.210
this is a fight with the bartender tied up like that.

3468
01:23:19.211 --> 01:23:20.890
The bartenders behind the Bar,

3469
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:22.600
your arm is somehow tied.

3470
01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:24.100
You're going to have to fight.

3471
01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.750
This is so stupid.

3472
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:29.900
I want to see some of this x arm.

3473
01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:30.501
That's it.

3474
01:23:30.501 --> 01:23:34.280
It was called a new sport is born and not really.

3475
01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:35.990
He showed it.

3476
01:23:35.991 --> 01:23:36.680
Yeah,

3477
01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:37.550
I'm getting crazy.

3478
01:23:37.551 --> 01:23:39.410
I'm throwing kicking incredible athletes.

3479
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:40.423
Yeah.

3480
01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:41.263
Ready?

3481
01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:42.921
Go.

3482
01:23:42.921 --> 01:23:44.030
I'm gonna Punch you in your fucking head.

3483
01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:45.490
What?

3484
01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:45.861
How do you,

3485
01:23:45.861 --> 01:23:49.550
when do you win by take bar.

3486
01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:50.800
Oh my God.

3487
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:52.490
My bar on the table.

3488
01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:54.110
That shit's ridiculous.

3489
01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:55.940
That it's so ridiculous.

3490
01:23:55.941 --> 01:23:56.774
Wait a minute.

3491
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:59.060
He's onto something.

3492
01:23:59.120 --> 01:23:59.990
This is so stupid.

3493
01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:01.120
Oh my God.

3494
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:01.953
Oh.

3495
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.541
Oh.

3496
01:24:02.541 --> 01:24:03.290
They stopped it.

3497
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:06.140
But meanwhile the tied up pin his arm.

3498
01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:07.251
You pinned his arm.

3499
01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:08.084
You win.

3500
01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:09.073
Wait a minute.

3501
01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:12.220
This is so fucking stupid.

3502
01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.230
Why don't they just been him right away so you don't get hit.

3503
01:24:15.231 --> 01:24:15.621
Look at this.

3504
01:24:15.621 --> 01:24:16.041
Doom.

3505
01:24:16.041 --> 01:24:16.550
Doom.

3506
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:19.500
She imagined if you pulled out your fucking arm.

3507
01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:23.970
This tool used to be a filling you up few,

3508
01:24:23.971 --> 01:24:24.890
but they fucked you over.

3509
01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:25.910
We fuck you.

3510
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:26.743
I don't look at anymore.

3511
01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:30.020
You bull that safety glasses.

3512
01:24:30.021 --> 01:24:33.760
The Ref has like you should just in case blood come stick rate in these sites.

3513
01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:34.581
Spit and shit.

3514
01:24:34.581 --> 01:24:35.414
That's a camera.

3515
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:36.770
Oh my God.

3516
01:24:36.771 --> 01:24:37.670
It's so dumb.

3517
01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:41.180
That is so they get so fucking dumb.

3518
01:24:42.650 --> 01:24:43.670
Oh my God,

3519
01:24:44.150 --> 01:24:45.380
I forgot about this.

3520
01:24:45.381 --> 01:24:46.610
I'm so glad you brought this up.

3521
01:24:46.611 --> 01:24:49.240
All that guy got kicked out and he's hanging on to day.

3522
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.851
I got him.

3523
01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:50.684
He's out cold.

3524
01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:52.250
Untied me from this dead man.

3525
01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.580
I did it to a trading partner.

3526
01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:55.250
Fucking stupid.

3527
01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.310
What'd you do to training partner?

3528
01:24:57.311 --> 01:24:58.280
I was very angry

3529
01:24:58.490 --> 01:25:01.460
<v 0>and a more angry than you were at the desk.</v>

3530
01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:02.690
You know what?

3531
01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:06.530
He had a fight and two weeks and he said this week at my friend's going to go to

3532
01:25:06.531 --> 01:25:09.320
Vegas for a Bachelor party.

3533
01:25:09.321 --> 01:25:10.310
You think I should go?

3534
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:11.903
<v 3>And I go,</v>

3535
01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:13.830
you're asking me for advice?

3536
01:25:13.831 --> 01:25:14.101
Yeah.

3537
01:25:14.101 --> 01:25:14.401
I said,

3538
01:25:14.401 --> 01:25:14.670
no,

3539
01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:15.503
don't go.

3540
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:16.440
This is going to go wrong.

3541
01:25:16.441 --> 01:25:17.011
You do drugs.

3542
01:25:17.011 --> 01:25:17.480
You got drunk.

3543
01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:18.313
<v 0>Give them everything.</v>

3544
01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:19.640
Of course it went wrong.

3545
01:25:19.641 --> 01:25:20.474
He did go.

3546
01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:23.600
So now I'm angry because he had a fight going on and I,

3547
01:25:23.601 --> 01:25:23.890
uh,

3548
01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:25.940
I said he wanted to train on,

3549
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.180
he was back on Saturday or Sunday and went to [inaudible],

3550
01:25:28.230 --> 01:25:28.791
let's do Monday,

3551
01:25:28.791 --> 01:25:29.960
give you an extra day rest.

3552
01:25:30.230 --> 01:25:32.810
When I came in and this time you're normally,

3553
01:25:32.811 --> 01:25:33.920
I never went to knock somebody out,

3554
01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:38.300
but I want to knock him out just because you couldn't find anyway already with

3555
01:25:38.301 --> 01:25:40.440
the young angry boss and every bus,

3556
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.850
no,

3557
01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:41.750
he didn't listen.

3558
01:25:41.751 --> 01:25:44.180
And now you got to fight it as your comp constantly complaining about you're

3559
01:25:44.181 --> 01:25:44.940
losing.

3560
01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:45.240
He had,

3561
01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.073
I mean,

3562
01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:49.640
it has a reason and this was one of the reasons this was the moment for him to

3563
01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:50.683
get a lesson.

3564
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:56.310
So I think first punch out through incredible heart and I remember I hit him and

3565
01:25:56.311 --> 01:25:57.420
I almost didn't feel the impact.

3566
01:25:57.421 --> 01:25:59.450
So you know that I hit him with a loose,

3567
01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:00.940
make sure to say what straight through.

3568
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:03.200
And I remember him falling over the rope

3569
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:06.140
<v 1>and I grabbed my stuff and I walked to my car,</v>

3570
01:26:06.141 --> 01:26:06.460
my car,

3571
01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:10.340
it was in the garage who were in the garage and the ring was in there.

3572
01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:14.450
It was at the front of my place and I walked over to my car and while I walked

3573
01:26:14.451 --> 01:26:14.721
over,

3574
01:26:14.721 --> 01:26:16.010
I look back and it was still hanging.

3575
01:26:16.011 --> 01:26:17.200
It was no movement whatsoever.

3576
01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:17.471
I got no,

3577
01:26:17.471 --> 01:26:17.870
I got,

3578
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:20.930
I got started to get worried because now it was out already funded two minutes

3579
01:26:20.931 --> 01:26:22.310
and no movement whatsoever.

3580
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:27.230
So I get in my car and then I drive by it and he still does no more just

3581
01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.370
somebody taking care of him.

3582
01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.890
And I got out of the car because I wanted to take care of him.

3583
01:26:30.891 --> 01:26:32.120
And as soon as I started walking,

3584
01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:32.690
I started,

3585
01:26:32.690 --> 01:26:33.620
he started twitching.

3586
01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.180
So I got in my car and I drove off.

3587
01:26:35.230 --> 01:26:36.063
Oh,

3588
01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.090
that's ridiculous.

3589
01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:39.350
Yeah.

3590
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:42.290
But it was a long time to fly.

3591
01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:43.520
He fought and he lost.

3592
01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:45.150
But he was lost.

3593
01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:46.340
He knocked him out two weeks ago.

3594
01:26:46.341 --> 01:26:46.581
No,

3595
01:26:46.581 --> 01:26:46.700
no,

3596
01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:46.881
no.

3597
01:26:46.881 --> 01:26:47.930
He was losing already.

3598
01:26:47.931 --> 01:26:50.200
And it was every time it was somebody else's thing and say,

3599
01:26:50.230 --> 01:26:52.820
well maybe you should stop smoking weed for a while.

3600
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.230
Maybe that was going to help them.

3601
01:26:54.231 --> 01:26:54.471
We know.

3602
01:26:54.471 --> 01:26:55.280
What about that?

3603
01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:55.910
Maybe that would help.

3604
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:56.480
No.

3605
01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:57.111
So if you,

3606
01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:59.900
if you wake up in the morning and he'd smoke a bong and do that all day long and

3607
01:26:59.901 --> 01:27:00.591
you keep doing it,

3608
01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:01.490
I mean maybe that's,

3609
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:02.720
that's the reason,

3610
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.790
right?

3611
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:05.960
You're not getting really up to your potential.

3612
01:27:06.230 --> 01:27:07.790
It could be a fabulous you nick the is.

3613
01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:08.713
Yeah,

3614
01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:09.860
it does affect him.

3615
01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:12.080
There's always a exemptions.

3616
01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.113
Yeah.

3617
01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:14.270
He's a real exemption.

3618
01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:14.841
I mean,

3619
01:27:14.841 --> 01:27:15.261
when people,

3620
01:27:15.261 --> 01:27:16.370
when people think about potheads,

3621
01:27:16.371 --> 01:27:19.010
you think about someone who's lazy and you think about people that have bad

3622
01:27:19.011 --> 01:27:19.491
endurance,

3623
01:27:19.491 --> 01:27:20.540
you would think he'd be lazy.

3624
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:23.060
But Nick Diaz has phenomenal insurance.

3625
01:27:23.061 --> 01:27:23.241
I mean,

3626
01:27:23.241 --> 01:27:24.440
he does triathlons.

3627
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:27.080
Do you know he swam from Alcatraz five times?

3628
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.390
I said two times and he corrected me.

3629
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:30.051
He goes,

3630
01:27:30.051 --> 01:27:31.070
no brow five times.

3631
01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:32.000
I'm like five.

3632
01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:37.100
I swam back from Alcatraz five fucking times in the shark infested waters.

3633
01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.740
But there were also,

3634
01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:40.910
they said it was a lot of,

3635
01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:41.450
you know,

3636
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:44.990
it was not as bad as what they let to prisoners.

3637
01:27:44.991 --> 01:27:45.201
No,

3638
01:27:45.201 --> 01:27:50.201
of course it was all my blood just because athletes are just so much better now.

3639
01:27:50.301 --> 01:27:51.350
But if you didn't swim,

3640
01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.760
it's not like they let them prepare.

3641
01:27:52.761 --> 01:27:53.540
And prison,

3642
01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:55.100
like do laps in the pool?

3643
01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:56.533
Like those guys,

3644
01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.010
they didn't have any endurance.

3645
01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:58.280
No,

3646
01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.500
they didn't have a little pool either.

3647
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.691
Right.

3648
01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:00.910
I'm thinking how can you walk,

3649
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:02.190
can your practice with me?

3650
01:28:02.191 --> 01:28:02.991
But it's a hard one.

3651
01:28:02.991 --> 01:28:03.800
That's a hard one.

3652
01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.090
I'm sure some of the made it.

3653
01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:09.500
There's a couple of guys did attempt to swim back from Alcatraz and one guy,

3654
01:28:09.501 --> 01:28:12.470
they found his clothes on the beach and they never found him.

3655
01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:16.370
And they assume that he got eaten by a shark or some shit and drown and they

3656
01:28:16.371 --> 01:28:17.330
just found it's close.

3657
01:28:17.331 --> 01:28:19.760
But it's entirely possible that guys swam all the way.

3658
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:22.160
If he was a fucking real animal,

3659
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:23.540
could swam all the way,

3660
01:28:23.541 --> 01:28:25.670
took his clothes off and when fuck you,

3661
01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:26.563
I'm out of here.

3662
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:29.030
Back then they didn't have no database laughing.

3663
01:28:29.031 --> 01:28:31.240
Right now he's nine years old.

3664
01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:34.880
You got a call in number?

3665
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:36.150
I got free.

3666
01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:38.301
Yeah.

3667
01:28:38.301 --> 01:28:38.571
I mean,

3668
01:28:38.571 --> 01:28:39.950
I think nobody,

3669
01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:40.490
uh,

3670
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:43.460
I don't think they know of anybody who definitely successfully made it.

3671
01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:45.500
But today people do it all the time.

3672
01:28:45.501 --> 01:28:47.810
It's a like all those triathlete,

3673
01:28:47.811 --> 01:28:48.644
endurance athlete,

3674
01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:51.050
those a serious animals,

3675
01:28:51.051 --> 01:28:54.140
those guys who do like triathlons,

3676
01:28:54.170 --> 01:28:55.310
ultra marathons,

3677
01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:56.600
those mother fuckers,

3678
01:28:56.601 --> 01:29:01.440
they have ridiculous cardio like show like a 90 year old woman who did it.

3679
01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:02.040
Really?

3680
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:02.350
<v 2>I mean,</v>

3681
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:02.570
yeah,

3682
01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:03.403
yeah,

3683
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:04.540
yeah.

3684
01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:04.690
Yes,

3685
01:29:04.690 --> 01:29:05.530
yes sir.

3686
01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.750
I'm also from Alcatraz.

3687
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:08.700
You have go to Elko tests.

3688
01:29:08.701 --> 01:29:09.710
You did right when I was,

3689
01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:10.610
it's cool.

3690
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:14.070
It's pretty cool to go to Al Capone's sal and just to see all that stuff.

3691
01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:14.640
It's weird.

3692
01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.690
The movie The rock.

3693
01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:16.261
You remember that?

3694
01:29:16.261 --> 01:29:17.094
That's right.

3695
01:29:17.850 --> 01:29:18.421
Clint Eastwood,

3696
01:29:18.421 --> 01:29:18.900
right?

3697
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:19.060
No,

3698
01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:19.141
no,

3699
01:29:19.141 --> 01:29:19.201
no,

3700
01:29:19.201 --> 01:29:19.610
no.

3701
01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:20.443
Uh,

3702
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:21.583
from Alcatraz,

3703
01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:23.430
which one's the rock?

3704
01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:24.990
The Rock Nic cage.

3705
01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:26.300
Nicolas Cage.

3706
01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:27.091
Yeah,

3707
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:27.421
that's it.

3708
01:29:27.421 --> 01:29:28.254
That's the difference.

3709
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:29.581
That's right.

3710
01:29:29.581 --> 01:29:30.660
Escape from Alcatraz.

3711
01:29:30.730 --> 01:29:31.563
The Hopkins.

3712
01:29:31.570 --> 01:29:32.403
Yeah.

3713
01:29:32.650 --> 01:29:33.151
Those guys.

3714
01:29:33.151 --> 01:29:33.770
They ski.

3715
01:29:33.770 --> 01:29:33.980
No,

3716
01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:34.770
no.

3717
01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:35.281
What's his name?

3718
01:29:35.281 --> 01:29:36.090
[inaudible] plate.

3719
01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:38.820
I'm a James Bond Board church bulletin.

3720
01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:39.970
Chaga mushroom [inaudible].

3721
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:41.640
Sean Connery.

3722
01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:44.210
Sean Connery is also such a bad ass guy.

3723
01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:45.660
I always love Sean Connery.

3724
01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.730
My favorite interview is him with Barbara Walters.

3725
01:29:47.731 --> 01:29:47.851
We,

3726
01:29:47.851 --> 01:29:49.110
he's talking about smack and women.

3727
01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:49.351
Oh,

3728
01:29:49.351 --> 01:29:50.400
I was just going to say that

3729
01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.630
sometimes you don't listen.

3730
01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:59.540
You let them have the last word and national enough and they need more and more.

3731
01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:03.490
You should just take her around and yeah,

3732
01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:05.063
there it is.

3733
01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:06.750
Escape from Alcatraz.

3734
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:08.580
Clint motherfucking Eastwood.

3735
01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:09.600
It says an escape.

3736
01:30:09.601 --> 01:30:10.434
Yeah.

3737
01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:15.460
So I don't think anybody like definitely escaped and made it across the ocean.

3738
01:30:16.230 --> 01:30:19.290
I don't think like there's one guy that they caught in San Francisco still on

3739
01:30:19.291 --> 01:30:20.430
the FBI's most wanted list,

3740
01:30:20.431 --> 01:30:21.450
but there some drowned.

3741
01:30:21.570 --> 01:30:23.400
There's still on the FBI's most wanted list.

3742
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:24.420
And what year was it?

3743
01:30:24.421 --> 01:30:25.021
This gate?

3744
01:30:25.021 --> 01:30:26.670
62 oh wow.

3745
01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:27.480
They might be a lie.

3746
01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:28.500
It might be still alive.

3747
01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:29.910
Wow.

3748
01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:31.110
Those three guys escaped.

3749
01:30:31.170 --> 01:30:31.590
Yeah.

3750
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:33.670
Look at those creeps and it never got found.

3751
01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:35.610
Wow.

3752
01:30:35.610 --> 01:30:38.280
It's probably drowned men.

3753
01:30:38.281 --> 01:30:38.911
If you hear us,

3754
01:30:38.911 --> 01:30:42.580
call us our tire rod day.

3755
01:30:43.170 --> 01:30:44.190
That will be a story.

3756
01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.330
Mother drug carved out ocean.

3757
01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:49.230
Google the 90 year old lady who made it.

3758
01:30:49.231 --> 01:30:50.040
That's insane.

3759
01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:50.873
You know what?

3760
01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:52.380
If they would still be alive,

3761
01:30:52.381 --> 01:30:53.460
they should write a book.

3762
01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:53.880
Right?

3763
01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:55.220
And then just before they died,

3764
01:30:55.221 --> 01:30:55.501
they say,

3765
01:30:55.501 --> 01:30:55.890
here,

3766
01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:57.460
this is how I escaped Alica dress.

3767
01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.460
And when he proceeds goes to the family,

3768
01:30:59.910 --> 01:31:00.743
wherever you

3769
01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:04.680
write a novel and gall,

3770
01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:06.220
why this is all fishy.

3771
01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:06.521
I,

3772
01:31:06.521 --> 01:31:06.990
yeah,

3773
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:08.040
like Oj Simpson.

3774
01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.161
If I,

3775
01:31:09.161 --> 01:31:10.050
if I did,

3776
01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:13.230
did you see the interview where he kind of like says that he did?

3777
01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:14.123
I saw that.

3778
01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:14.993
I didn't see it.

3779
01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:15.900
Oh yeah.

3780
01:31:15.901 --> 01:31:16.560
It's tricky.

3781
01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:16.921
You know,

3782
01:31:16.921 --> 01:31:17.521
you hear him saying,

3783
01:31:17.521 --> 01:31:20.400
because sometimes she forgets he isn't talking to third person.

3784
01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.440
Sometimes he talks shit and then he,

3785
01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:23.603
he took dish.

3786
01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:24.380
Suddenly he,

3787
01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:25.500
he made this really,

3788
01:31:25.501 --> 01:31:26.760
we have karate stance.

3789
01:31:26.850 --> 01:31:29.350
Like you knew karate and that it's quiet.

3790
01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:29.970
He says,

3791
01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:30.660
oh,

3792
01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:31.141
of course.

3793
01:31:31.141 --> 01:31:31.300
Uh,

3794
01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:31.591
you know,

3795
01:31:31.591 --> 01:31:33.000
that will be in my mind.

3796
01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:33.451
You know,

3797
01:31:33.451 --> 01:31:34.920
he would correct himself every time.

3798
01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:36.553
Yeah.

3799
01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.920
Took a karate post.

3800
01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:41.250
It's weird that he's out there roaming around now ladies.

3801
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:42.810
Oh,

3802
01:31:42.810 --> 01:31:44.760
I'm sure this is a lot of crazy bitches out there.

3803
01:31:44.970 --> 01:31:46.500
Apparently that Parkland shooter,

3804
01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:49.290
that kid that killed all those kids in Florida,

3805
01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.480
it just gets fan mail all day long.

3806
01:31:51.481 --> 01:31:52.130
They say,

3807
01:31:52.130 --> 01:31:54.030
goes with a Marian girls want to marry him.

3808
01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:54.720
Yeah.

3809
01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.220
That was the thing with Richard Ramirez,

3810
01:31:56.221 --> 01:31:57.060
the night stalker,

3811
01:31:57.330 --> 01:31:59.890
he just got tons of marriage requests.

3812
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.380
<v 1>There's a lot of girls who want to marry psychos.</v>

3813
01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.160
Yeah.

3814
01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.300
It's so strange.

3815
01:32:04.330 --> 01:32:04.781
It's a,

3816
01:32:04.781 --> 01:32:04.991
yeah.

3817
01:32:04.991 --> 01:32:07.270
Something really bad happened to them or who were young I guess,

3818
01:32:07.271 --> 01:32:07.690
you know.

3819
01:32:07.690 --> 01:32:08.140
I mean,

3820
01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:08.790
otherwise,

3821
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:09.491
how'd he get there?

3822
01:32:09.491 --> 01:32:12.130
How do you get it was to a spotlight that I don't know.

3823
01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:13.100
Yeah.

3824
01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:15.640
I people when it's wet,

3825
01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.380
we need bigger penalties for things.

3826
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.310
That's where we need,

3827
01:32:18.610 --> 01:32:19.151
I like that.

3828
01:32:19.151 --> 01:32:19.984
What you said,

3829
01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:20.321
you know,

3830
01:32:20.321 --> 01:32:21.011
no more warning.

3831
01:32:21.011 --> 01:32:21.311
Boom.

3832
01:32:21.311 --> 01:32:22.031
Do it one time.

3833
01:32:22.031 --> 01:32:23.190
I think she's good at it.

3834
01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:23.620
Terrifies.

3835
01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:24.041
Yeah.

3836
01:32:24.041 --> 01:32:24.521
For fights.

3837
01:32:24.521 --> 01:32:25.570
I think I pokes,

3838
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.991
well,

3839
01:32:25.991 --> 01:32:26.824
here's the thing.

3840
01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:28.330
Even if you didn't mean to do it,

3841
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:32.590
the other guy got poked in the eye and that's a significant impact and it could

3842
01:32:32.650 --> 01:32:35.170
affect the vision and we know many fights that have changed,

3843
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:36.310
changed the course of the fight.

3844
01:32:36.311 --> 01:32:37.570
Like Travis Brown,

3845
01:32:37.571 --> 01:32:38.410
Matt Mitrione,

3846
01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:39.461
Mitre owns wing.

3847
01:32:39.461 --> 01:32:40.031
The fight he gets,

3848
01:32:40.031 --> 01:32:43.120
I poked by Travis Brown and he winds up getting beaten up and stopped.

3849
01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:43.690
It was,

3850
01:32:43.690 --> 01:32:44.440
it was a big,

3851
01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.560
big moment in the fight and it came from an iPod.

3852
01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:47.170
Yup.

3853
01:32:47.170 --> 01:32:48.910
Those kinds of situations happen.

3854
01:32:48.911 --> 01:32:50.710
And even if they're at by accident,

3855
01:32:51.010 --> 01:32:51.880
it doesn't matter.

3856
01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:52.721
They happen.

3857
01:32:52.721 --> 01:32:57.010
And when they happen that's a giant impact and that giant impact should be

3858
01:32:57.011 --> 01:32:57.701
penalized.

3859
01:32:57.701 --> 01:32:58.240
Yup.

3860
01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.550
Cause that guy can't see now it's like looking like this.

3861
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:04.480
I got the stabbed in my hand in pro wrestling and you literally what they say

3862
01:33:04.481 --> 01:33:05.470
you'll see three people.

3863
01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:06.453
Yeah I couldn't,

3864
01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:07.220
I go to folks,

3865
01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:08.050
referee goes by,

3866
01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:08.271
I get,

3867
01:33:08.271 --> 01:33:10.200
did I get see anything in Japan?

3868
01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:10.981
Yeah it was protesting.

3869
01:33:10.981 --> 01:33:11.210
He sucks.

3870
01:33:11.210 --> 01:33:12.340
Fight fighters and okay I'll fly.

3871
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:16.720
But don't they do some hard pro wrestling in Japan sometimes.

3872
01:33:16.721 --> 01:33:16.960
Right.

3873
01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.130
Strong style they call it.

3874
01:33:18.131 --> 01:33:22.000
So that's why it's so good for the mixed martial artists because they use real

3875
01:33:22.001 --> 01:33:22.900
submission moves.

3876
01:33:22.901 --> 01:33:24.430
If you go to the WWE,

3877
01:33:24.431 --> 01:33:24.990
you know they,

3878
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.820
you see moves.

3879
01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:28.150
So they tap on things that are not even move sometimes.

3880
01:33:28.151 --> 01:33:28.660
Right.

3881
01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:29.493
So you know,

3882
01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:33.250
it's teacher Debbie guys got mad at me cause I was analyzing the figure four

3883
01:33:33.251 --> 01:33:36.880
toehold and I was saying the other guys actually in a better position,

3884
01:33:37.150 --> 01:33:38.920
the guy who was getting the toehold has a,

3885
01:33:38.921 --> 01:33:39.900
he'll look right,

3886
01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.550
let's reach over and grab a hold of that shit.

3887
01:33:42.551 --> 01:33:43.210
You got it.

3888
01:33:43.210 --> 01:33:43.960
Yeah.

3889
01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:44.890
People were mad at me.

3890
01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:48.430
[inaudible] guys were so mad for telling the truth.

3891
01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:52.870
There was saying that I'm somehow or another diminishing their,

3892
01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:53.680
their thing.

3893
01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:55.780
Like you guys just did Wrestlemania last night.

3894
01:33:55.781 --> 01:34:00.160
It was the biggest fucking thing on TV that's not diminishing it,

3895
01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:01.140
but it's,

3896
01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:01.680
you get,

3897
01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:04.900
you can't get mad if someone's pointing out reality.

3898
01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:05.950
It is real.

3899
01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:07.270
You know what if they say,

3900
01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:10.960
I think they're amazing guys.

3901
01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:11.561
Yeah,

3902
01:34:11.561 --> 01:34:11.740
they're,

3903
01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:14.920
I mean I was almost about to sign for them a long time ago.

3904
01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.060
Uh,

3905
01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:16.893
but I would,

3906
01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:19.570
I thought it was going to get away with like 2030 shows.

3907
01:34:19.770 --> 01:34:20.010
No,

3908
01:34:20.010 --> 01:34:20.111
no,

3909
01:34:20.111 --> 01:34:20.181
no,

3910
01:34:20.181 --> 01:34:20.381
no,

3911
01:34:20.381 --> 01:34:20.501
no.

3912
01:34:20.501 --> 01:34:24.550
Minimum was two 2,220 shows yet that's what out to traveling.

3913
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:25.511
So I go,

3914
01:34:25.511 --> 01:34:25.841
you know,

3915
01:34:25.841 --> 01:34:28.240
and these guys take bumps every single night.

3916
01:34:28.241 --> 01:34:29.074
Can you imagine?

3917
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:30.310
And it's two 20 shows.

3918
01:34:30.311 --> 01:34:30.551
You know,

3919
01:34:30.551 --> 01:34:31.660
if you look at it as stone cold,

3920
01:34:31.661 --> 01:34:32.141
Steve Austin,

3921
01:34:32.141 --> 01:34:32.681
all these guys,

3922
01:34:32.681 --> 01:34:33.071
the Rock,

3923
01:34:33.071 --> 01:34:33.790
Dwayne Johnson,

3924
01:34:33.790 --> 01:34:34.271
all these guys,

3925
01:34:34.271 --> 01:34:35.440
they did way more year.

3926
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:37.540
They did two shows in one night.

3927
01:34:37.541 --> 01:34:39.820
They say they were going from town to town.

3928
01:34:40.090 --> 01:34:41.260
That's a crazy life.

3929
01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:42.460
A stone cold.

3930
01:34:42.461 --> 01:34:45.490
Steve Austin eating a role because that no more money.

3931
01:34:45.710 --> 01:34:47.440
Raw potatoes eating in the car,

3932
01:34:47.441 --> 01:34:50.080
driving from event to event cause he had no money,

3933
01:34:50.110 --> 01:34:52.480
had no money at the time he was building himself up.

3934
01:34:53.050 --> 01:34:53.950
He was eating raw,

3935
01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:55.031
raw potatoes.

3936
01:34:55.031 --> 01:34:55.864
Yeah.

3937
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:58.130
What does a raw potato tastes like?

3938
01:34:58.130 --> 01:34:58.710
<v 2>A raw potato.</v>

3939
01:34:58.710 --> 01:35:01.550
Like not good little bitter.

3940
01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:02.150
Right?

3941
01:35:02.150 --> 01:35:02.951
Remember we can share.

3942
01:35:02.951 --> 01:35:04.700
Mark was the world's most dangerous man.

3943
01:35:04.710 --> 01:35:05.543
Yeah,

3944
01:35:05.690 --> 01:35:06.051
he did.

3945
01:35:06.051 --> 01:35:07.310
It just jacked.

3946
01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.380
He was so jacked back then.

3947
01:35:09.381 --> 01:35:10.250
It was ridiculous.

3948
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:11.930
Remember how big he got?

3949
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.950
Holy Shit.

3950
01:35:12.951 --> 01:35:13.580
He got big.

3951
01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:14.360
Yeah.

3952
01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:15.550
It was like 260 pounds

3953
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:21.620
yet so unbelievably tough way to make a living.

3954
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:22.850
Unbelievable tough.

3955
01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:24.590
What does this to start just share to retire.

3956
01:35:24.591 --> 01:35:28.640
Yesterday she got kicked in the back of the house show and snapped her neck.

3957
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:31.880
But you see how show like a non televised show.

3958
01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:32.530
Wow.

3959
01:35:32.530 --> 01:35:34.970
I'm one of the 220 shows they have to do like uh,

3960
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.750
not in la like whenever Kansas Wednesday night.

3961
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.860
Whoa.

3962
01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:41.120
Very injury prone man.

3963
01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:42.500
Because she's constantly,

3964
01:35:42.501 --> 01:35:43.161
constantly,

3965
01:35:43.161 --> 01:35:43.381
it's,

3966
01:35:43.381 --> 01:35:44.840
it's really a amazing older falls.

3967
01:35:44.841 --> 01:35:48.550
All these things are real so people can say whatever they want and know.

3968
01:35:48.670 --> 01:35:49.040
People say,

3969
01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:49.360
oh,

3970
01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:50.240
protesting is fake.

3971
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.751
Yeah.

3972
01:35:50.751 --> 01:35:51.584
So it was acting.

3973
01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.620
So let's,

3974
01:35:53.630 --> 01:35:57.200
let's be honest there you got one of your worst injuries from stunts.

3975
01:35:59.690 --> 01:36:02.800
Nowhere effect lights out to show on Fx.

3976
01:36:02.801 --> 01:36:03.570
You Remember Miguel?

3977
01:36:03.570 --> 01:36:04.140
Honey,

3978
01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:04.730
bye bye.

3979
01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:05.031
If you're,

3980
01:36:05.031 --> 01:36:06.110
by the way you want to talk to him.

3981
01:36:06.111 --> 01:36:09.290
He's the lead guy in the mine hunter and that TV show.

3982
01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:10.161
What is mine?

3983
01:36:10.161 --> 01:36:11.660
Hot Mine Hunter you didn't see on Netflix.

3984
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:13.610
That's that show about serial killers.

3985
01:36:13.630 --> 01:36:14.463
Yeah,

3986
01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:15.553
no kidding.

3987
01:36:15.730 --> 01:36:15.921
Yeah.

3988
01:36:15.921 --> 01:36:16.790
I mean look man,

3989
01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:21.820
that what they have to do is one of the hardest jobs in all show business 220

3990
01:36:22.191 --> 01:36:22.941
shows a year.

3991
01:36:22.941 --> 01:36:24.860
Getting slammed and knocked around like that.

3992
01:36:24.861 --> 01:36:26.510
It's one of the hardest jobs in show business.

3993
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:29.120
But you're a tough guy.

3994
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:30.710
Don't be such a pussy.

3995
01:36:30.711 --> 01:36:33.380
If someone says that a figure four leg lock doesn't work,

3996
01:36:33.381 --> 01:36:33.760
don't talk.

3997
01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:35.330
That's when the skin is very thin.

3998
01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.200
Just very thin.

3999
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:37.460
I don't understand.

4000
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.220
Instead of digging this constructive criticism,

4001
01:36:40.221 --> 01:36:40.370
yeah,

4002
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:41.720
I've got nothing but respect for them.

4003
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:42.200
Yeah,

4004
01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:44.660
but relax to take jokes.

4005
01:36:45.170 --> 01:36:46.430
You can't tell jokes anymore.

4006
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:48.520
I was so on inside MMA,

4007
01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:49.180
right.

4008
01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:49.530
I,

4009
01:36:49.530 --> 01:36:50.140
I'm telling,

4010
01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:52.790
I think at the rep up and I didn't even notice was the rep,

4011
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:56.960
I don't even remember I sat this so I'm busy and I said,

4012
01:36:56.961 --> 01:36:57.201
yeah,

4013
01:36:57.201 --> 01:36:57.441
right.

4014
01:36:57.441 --> 01:36:57.891
Who could write,

4015
01:36:57.891 --> 01:36:58.431
who knock out?

4016
01:36:58.431 --> 01:36:58.780
We shoot,

4017
01:36:58.780 --> 01:36:58.890
we,

4018
01:36:58.890 --> 01:36:59.550
she highlights.

4019
01:36:59.550 --> 01:37:00.620
I'd tell Kenny Rice.

4020
01:37:00.621 --> 01:37:00.880
I said,

4021
01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:01.711
mad right hook,

4022
01:37:01.711 --> 01:37:02.390
duck out.

4023
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.691
I said,

4024
01:37:02.691 --> 01:37:03.530
I love to see that.

4025
01:37:03.531 --> 01:37:04.590
It's so underused.

4026
01:37:04.591 --> 01:37:05.424
The right hook.

4027
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.900
I said,

4028
01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:07.220
you should really practice that.

4029
01:37:07.221 --> 01:37:08.270
And so Kenny says to me,

4030
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:09.620
how do you practice that?

4031
01:37:09.650 --> 01:37:09.981
I said,

4032
01:37:09.981 --> 01:37:10.131
well,

4033
01:37:10.131 --> 01:37:10.731
if you're married,

4034
01:37:10.731 --> 01:37:11.031
you said,

4035
01:37:11.031 --> 01:37:11.391
hey honey,

4036
01:37:11.391 --> 01:37:14.900
can you come over here for a second and right away I'm looking in the camera and

4037
01:37:14.901 --> 01:37:15.410
I say,

4038
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:16.011
I'm kidding.

4039
01:37:16.011 --> 01:37:16.491
Of course,

4040
01:37:16.491 --> 01:37:17.324
right.

4041
01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:20.420
I'm literally saying it because I know there's always people,

4042
01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:21.560
but I started laughing.

4043
01:37:21.561 --> 01:37:22.394
It's a joke.

4044
01:37:22.730 --> 01:37:25.850
I don't even remember me saying this on my Facebook.

4045
01:37:25.850 --> 01:37:26.720
I had this,

4046
01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:27.711
you know,

4047
01:37:27.711 --> 01:37:32.630
feminist organization that attacking me that I couldn't say that I would hit my

4048
01:37:32.631 --> 01:37:33.411
wife and I go,

4049
01:37:33.411 --> 01:37:33.891
I didn't say,

4050
01:37:33.891 --> 01:37:35.720
I went through the whole show and I go,

4051
01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:36.950
where did I say it?

4052
01:37:36.951 --> 01:37:41.150
And it was the literally the last 20 seconds where I said it and two seconds

4053
01:37:41.151 --> 01:37:41.690
later I said,

4054
01:37:41.690 --> 01:37:42.411
I'm just getting,

4055
01:37:42.411 --> 01:37:42.951
it's a joke.

4056
01:37:42.951 --> 01:37:43.784
You could never do that,

4057
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.390
you know?

4058
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:46.950
But people are so thin skinned can do anything.

4059
01:37:46.951 --> 01:37:51.200
And these were the same people when they asked me what did I enjoy the most of

4060
01:37:51.201 --> 01:37:51.951
women fighting,

4061
01:37:51.951 --> 01:37:52.970
I thought I'd make a joke.

4062
01:37:52.971 --> 01:37:53.331
I said,

4063
01:37:53.331 --> 01:37:54.830
the way it's all right.

4064
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:56.010
I thought it was funny to

4065
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:57.390
<v 1>say because they're in the bikinis,</v>

4066
01:37:57.610 --> 01:37:57.900
right?

4067
01:37:57.900 --> 01:37:58.210
Yup.

4068
01:37:58.210 --> 01:38:00.010
Say Feminist Organization,

4069
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:02.510
we are in this business and you get to,

4070
01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:03.121
and I told him,

4071
01:38:03.121 --> 01:38:03.450
I said,

4072
01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:05.130
if you're in the MMA business,

4073
01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:05.601
I said,

4074
01:38:05.601 --> 01:38:06.434
get out.

4075
01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:07.890
Because we opened,

4076
01:38:07.891 --> 01:38:11.250
they opened like they just don't say it on the,

4077
01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:12.330
on the nice end.

4078
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:13.930
Right on the nice end they think,

4079
01:38:14.210 --> 01:38:14.490
yeah,

4080
01:38:14.490 --> 01:38:14.770
yeah,

4081
01:38:14.770 --> 01:38:15.610
the dark end.

4082
01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:16.471
Or they go like,

4083
01:38:16.471 --> 01:38:18.990
you know what I will do at this moment with the girl like that.

4084
01:38:18.991 --> 01:38:19.750
That's how you,

4085
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:20.583
how bad it is.

4086
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:22.740
Do you ever see Derrick Lewis is Instagram?

4087
01:38:23.250 --> 01:38:23.790
Oh,

4088
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:28.230
Derrick Lewis has the most fucking hilarious Instagram pushing it,

4089
01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:31.740
pushes it as far as pushing it.

4090
01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:35.970
You see the shit that he did with Ronda Rousey after he knocked out Travis

4091
01:38:35.970 --> 01:38:36.150
Browne,

4092
01:38:36.150 --> 01:38:37.560
after he knocked out Travis Brown,

4093
01:38:37.561 --> 01:38:40.050
I mean he knocked out her boyfriend and he's got,

4094
01:38:40.051 --> 01:38:42.540
or now her husband and he's got all these videos of him,

4095
01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:45.720
his face and he's,

4096
01:38:45.721 --> 01:38:46.441
you know,

4097
01:38:46.441 --> 01:38:46.900
I'll play.

4098
01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:50.700
They put his face on someone else's body and Ron does face on someone else's

4099
01:38:50.701 --> 01:38:51.061
body.

4100
01:38:51.061 --> 01:38:53.070
It's like he's crazy.

4101
01:38:53.610 --> 01:38:54.480
He's crazy.

4102
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:55.343
It's funny though.

4103
01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:56.420
He's how so?

4104
01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.273
There is a liking.

4105
01:38:57.330 --> 01:38:59.220
His Instagram page is fucking hilarious,

4106
01:38:59.221 --> 01:38:59.821
but I'm always like,

4107
01:38:59.821 --> 01:39:00.510
what?

4108
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:04.620
How long is it going to take for someone to find that page and just go over his

4109
01:39:04.621 --> 01:39:09.621
archives to go what in the aisle like you can't do because it's obviously he's

4110
01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:12.270
joking around and he's a very funny guy.

4111
01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:13.950
Before you saw the after.

4112
01:39:19.190 --> 01:39:19.720
Oh,

4113
01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:21.510
Derek is fucking funny man.

4114
01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:23.310
Who he fighting next?

4115
01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:24.591
<v 0>I don't know,</v>

4116
01:39:24.591 --> 01:39:25.424
but

4117
01:39:26.110 --> 01:39:26.411
<v 3>sting.</v>

4118
01:39:26.411 --> 01:39:27.660
Ridiculous video.

4119
01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:29.260
So people do stupid shit.

4120
01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:30.580
Like if you just go to his,

4121
01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:31.320
his Po,

4122
01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:33.160
it's almost always he ever,

4123
01:39:33.370 --> 01:39:34.570
what's going on with his hand?

4124
01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:35.920
What does the gun on their,

4125
01:39:36.670 --> 01:39:36.941
damn,

4126
01:39:36.941 --> 01:39:37.720
that shit hurts.

4127
01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:39.340
I have a fourth metacarpal fracture.

4128
01:39:39.370 --> 01:39:39.581
Oh,

4129
01:39:39.581 --> 01:39:40.810
February 21st all right,

4130
01:39:40.811 --> 01:39:42.610
well he ain't fighting anybody anytime soon.

4131
01:39:43.630 --> 01:39:43.901
Oh,

4132
01:39:43.901 --> 01:39:44.690
they're digging in there.

4133
01:39:44.690 --> 01:39:45.370
What are they doing?

4134
01:39:45.370 --> 01:39:45.551
Oh,

4135
01:39:45.551 --> 01:39:47.140
they're extracting.

4136
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.740
Yeah.

4137
01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:48.011
Yeah.

4138
01:39:48.011 --> 01:39:49.530
They're pulling out the puss.

4139
01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:52.900
Get in their son.

4140
01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:54.380
Pull that pass out,

4141
01:39:54.381 --> 01:39:54.500
right?

4142
01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:55.880
<v 1>Yah.</v>

4143
01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:57.990
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

4144
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.250
Yeah.

4145
01:39:58.250 --> 01:40:03.250
They did a one to me one time I was in Japan and then Hennison stands next to me

4146
01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:06.350
was at the table eating and he says,

4147
01:40:06.351 --> 01:40:08.090
where's the heat coming from and to to me.

4148
01:40:08.091 --> 01:40:13.091
And then he put us with his arm and my arm was infected and it was trimming out

4149
01:40:13.401 --> 01:40:14.600
heat and he goes,

4150
01:40:14.601 --> 01:40:14.960
dude,

4151
01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:17.090
you could staph infection buses is really bad.

4152
01:40:17.091 --> 01:40:17.800
You got to lose.

4153
01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:18.071
I said,

4154
01:40:18.071 --> 01:40:18.831
I'll do it when I'm home.

4155
01:40:18.831 --> 01:40:19.071
He says,

4156
01:40:19.071 --> 01:40:19.241
no,

4157
01:40:19.241 --> 01:40:19.310
no,

4158
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.361
no,

4159
01:40:19.361 --> 01:40:19.490
no.

4160
01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:20.330
You've got to go to the hospital.

4161
01:40:20.331 --> 01:40:21.470
And I know this is very bad.

4162
01:40:22.130 --> 01:40:24.140
I went to the hospital in Japan.

4163
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:26.320
They put it in an insurance.

4164
01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:26.601
I just,

4165
01:40:26.601 --> 01:40:27.431
big giant switch.

4166
01:40:27.431 --> 01:40:28.760
You start pulling out stuff.

4167
01:40:29.210 --> 01:40:30.870
It was like the Green Goblin,

4168
01:40:30.871 --> 01:40:31.401
that liquid,

4169
01:40:31.401 --> 01:40:32.690
that green glue liquid.

4170
01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:34.370
Completely clear,

4171
01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:37.250
not one little sliver of slime or whatever in it.

4172
01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:38.810
Completely clear.

4173
01:40:38.811 --> 01:40:41.030
Like the doctor was pulling it out and he goes,

4174
01:40:41.130 --> 01:40:42.210
Ooh God,

4175
01:40:42.330 --> 01:40:45.910
you start talking to all the other doctors and they came running over to says,

4176
01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:50.180
I want to say they pulled it out and it was a whole big sewage filled up with

4177
01:40:50.181 --> 01:40:52.430
green clear stuff.

4178
01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:52.990
Whoa.

4179
01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:53.291
Weird.

4180
01:40:53.291 --> 01:40:53.680
Right.

4181
01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.010
Very

4182
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:54.251
<v 1>weird.</v>

4183
01:40:54.251 --> 01:40:54.941
What they do with it.

4184
01:40:54.941 --> 01:40:56.410
Give you some serious antibiotics.

4185
01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:57.340
Antibiotics.

4186
01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:57.521
Yeah.

4187
01:40:57.521 --> 01:40:57.810
Yeah.

4188
01:40:57.810 --> 01:41:00.000
There was this moment pan with Daymond Perrier.

4189
01:41:00.001 --> 01:41:00.491
Remember when?

4190
01:41:00.491 --> 01:41:03.470
I'm sure we did that show and how much laying on the bar.

4191
01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:05.980
I was acting like I was drunk and everybody says do it.

4192
01:41:05.981 --> 01:41:07.000
Dad was unbelievable.

4193
01:41:07.001 --> 01:41:07.390
You were at,

4194
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:09.130
that was how sick I was,

4195
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:12.130
so I acted like I was drunk and I was sweating,

4196
01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.420
but I was from the real sickness.

4197
01:41:13.421 --> 01:41:17.160
I was literally between takes laying on the desk.

4198
01:41:17.410 --> 01:41:18.250
Wow.

4199
01:41:20.770 --> 01:41:21.071
I did.

4200
01:41:21.071 --> 01:41:22.930
To take and would fall back again.

4201
01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:23.610
Wow.

4202
01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:24.610
I was destroyed.

4203
01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.130
Did you fly home with that?

4204
01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:27.791
Yeah,

4205
01:41:27.791 --> 01:41:28.660
but it was two days later.

4206
01:41:28.690 --> 01:41:31.690
I started feeling much better than the next day after they gave me oral

4207
01:41:31.691 --> 01:41:35.260
antibiotics or Ivy Oral Niv in my view right away.

4208
01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:36.413
Yeah.

4209
01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:37.400
So staff,

4210
01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:38.950
it scares the shit out of me,

4211
01:41:38.951 --> 01:41:39.784
man.

4212
01:41:40.210 --> 01:41:41.050
You can lose something.

4213
01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:43.420
You were met a staff on Kevin Randleman.

4214
01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:47.920
You had holes the hole in his arm underneath.

4215
01:41:47.921 --> 01:41:48.520
Yeah,

4216
01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:49.480
like a snob box.

4217
01:41:49.481 --> 01:41:49.691
You know,

4218
01:41:49.691 --> 01:41:51.010
like we did the tobacco thing.

4219
01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:52.360
You could hide it in there.

4220
01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:55.420
You can literally see his muscles.

4221
01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:55.720
Yeah.

4222
01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:57.490
And all his tendons and everything in there.

4223
01:41:57.491 --> 01:41:58.960
It was fucking crazy.

4224
01:41:58.990 --> 01:42:00.580
Kevin Randleman staff.

4225
01:42:00.670 --> 01:42:01.150
Yeah.

4226
01:42:01.150 --> 01:42:04.000
He's got one of the most famous staph infections ever.

4227
01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:05.800
It's horrible animal.

4228
01:42:05.801 --> 01:42:06.610
This guy,

4229
01:42:06.610 --> 01:42:07.660
my friend Ari and I,

4230
01:42:07.670 --> 01:42:10.240
my rei was taken Jujitsu for a while.

4231
01:42:10.241 --> 01:42:13.330
We were playing pool and I noticed him walking around the pool table.

4232
01:42:13.331 --> 01:42:14.050
He's limping.

4233
01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:14.381
And I go,

4234
01:42:14.381 --> 01:42:14.580
wow,

4235
01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:15.460
what's going on with you man?

4236
01:42:15.461 --> 01:42:15.700
He goes,

4237
01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:15.970
ah,

4238
01:42:15.970 --> 01:42:17.530
figuring out a spider bite on my knee.

4239
01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:18.270
Look at that.

4240
01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:20.020
Look at a God damn.

4241
01:42:20.021 --> 01:42:20.854
That's crazy.

4242
01:42:21.570 --> 01:42:22.840
That is so crazy.

4243
01:42:22.841 --> 01:42:23.890
That's like systemic.

4244
01:42:23.891 --> 01:42:24.760
When it's that bad,

4245
01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:26.500
when is that deep and your body?

4246
01:42:26.650 --> 01:42:28.180
So I looked at Ari,

4247
01:42:28.181 --> 01:42:28.451
I go,

4248
01:42:28.451 --> 01:42:28.900
what?

4249
01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:29.201
I go,

4250
01:42:29.201 --> 01:42:31.630
you got an a spider bite or let me see your knee,

4251
01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.880
and he pulls his pants leg up and I go,

4252
01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:34.450
dude,

4253
01:42:34.450 --> 01:42:35.710
you have staph infection.

4254
01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:36.790
Listen to me right now.

4255
01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:37.870
You've got to go to the hospital.

4256
01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:38.740
Immediately.

4257
01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:39.731
He goes,

4258
01:42:39.731 --> 01:42:40.050
what?

4259
01:42:40.050 --> 01:42:40.631
It was a big deal.

4260
01:42:40.631 --> 01:42:40.841
I go,

4261
01:42:40.841 --> 01:42:40.991
no,

4262
01:42:40.991 --> 01:42:41.090
no,

4263
01:42:41.090 --> 01:42:41.410
no.

4264
01:42:41.410 --> 01:42:42.320
This could kill you.

4265
01:42:42.670 --> 01:42:45.160
You have a real bad staph infection.

4266
01:42:45.161 --> 01:42:47.980
It was like a fucking big Whitehead and was like,

4267
01:42:47.981 --> 01:42:49.960
go to the hospital right now.

4268
01:42:49.961 --> 01:42:50.201
He's like,

4269
01:42:50.201 --> 01:42:50.890
are you serious?

4270
01:42:50.890 --> 01:42:51.910
I unscrewed my cue.

4271
01:42:51.911 --> 01:42:52.151
I'll go,

4272
01:42:52.151 --> 01:42:52.391
dude,

4273
01:42:52.391 --> 01:42:53.050
we're done.

4274
01:42:53.050 --> 01:42:53.261
I go,

4275
01:42:53.261 --> 01:42:54.100
you gotta go to the hospital.

4276
01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:54.581
I'll take you.

4277
01:42:54.581 --> 01:42:55.690
You want to go to the hospital right now?

4278
01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.610
He went to the hospital right then and there and they were like,

4279
01:42:57.611 --> 01:42:58.444
Holy Shit.

4280
01:42:58.450 --> 01:42:59.580
Oh.

4281
01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:00.423
Hooked him up with them.

4282
01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:02.050
Then he got it again.

4283
01:43:02.051 --> 01:43:03.100
I think afterwards,

4284
01:43:03.101 --> 01:43:05.680
like sometimes it can relapse when you get it bad,

4285
01:43:05.890 --> 01:43:08.650
when you get it in your system and you don't completely get it out of your

4286
01:43:08.651 --> 01:43:09.250
system.

4287
01:43:09.250 --> 01:43:10.570
Sometimes it can come back.

4288
01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:12.420
A friend of mine had this point,

4289
01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:14.830
blue blood poisoning and from a,

4290
01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:16.880
from a low kick it was all his leg.

4291
01:43:16.881 --> 01:43:21.460
There was fluids in his little pinky thick,

4292
01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:25.000
purple line started going up on his body like dough is the heart.

4293
01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:26.050
Oh yeah,

4294
01:43:26.230 --> 01:43:27.370
you got to see that leg.

4295
01:43:27.371 --> 01:43:32.200
I mean they went in that they stapled it close with like 34 of those staples to

4296
01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:33.941
hold fire.

4297
01:43:33.941 --> 01:43:34.910
He's got a scar.

4298
01:43:34.911 --> 01:43:35.410
Ah,

4299
01:43:35.410 --> 01:43:36.243
crazy scar.

4300
01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:36.851
Yeah,

4301
01:43:36.851 --> 01:43:37.870
from low kicks,

4302
01:43:37.871 --> 01:43:38.680
from locates.

4303
01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:42.980
That's didn't treat it man and it just kept on working and something went wrong

4304
01:43:42.981 --> 01:43:44.580
and [inaudible] affection.

4305
01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:44.921
Yes.

4306
01:43:44.921 --> 01:43:45.754
That's clutter.

4307
01:43:46.650 --> 01:43:47.160
No one has that.

4308
01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:48.250
You see how I did that clinic?

4309
01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.420
I see fingers.

4310
01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:50.733
All right that,

4311
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.333
that's fast.

4312
01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:55.130
<v 3>What do you think I need to ask you about some certain shit.</v>

4313
01:43:55.160 --> 01:44:00.160
Like what do you think about the Jon Jones situation like with John Jones test

4314
01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:03.830
and positive but saying it was a tainted supplement,

4315
01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:05.293
which think about all that.

4316
01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:06.660
<v 0>I think Azure.</v>

4317
01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:07.061
Okay.

4318
01:44:07.061 --> 01:44:08.680
I'll go back all the way back window.

4319
01:44:08.770 --> 01:44:10.710
You could do pretty much anything you wanted.

4320
01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:11.010
Right?

4321
01:44:11.010 --> 01:44:11.550
Right.

4322
01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:14.010
I brought my own bread on foot everything to Japan.

4323
01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:15.630
If I would go to a hall,

4324
01:44:15.810 --> 01:44:16.830
I will bring my own water.

4325
01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:18.240
I wouldn't drink the water they had there.

4326
01:44:18.241 --> 01:44:21.930
I heard all the war stories of fighting in foreign countries that they might

4327
01:44:21.931 --> 01:44:23.520
taint it or something to do something.

4328
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:27.270
Make sure every product that you take as a professional athlete is your

4329
01:44:27.271 --> 01:44:28.170
responsibility.

4330
01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:28.891
You know?

4331
01:44:28.891 --> 01:44:29.910
So once that happens,

4332
01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:33.720
and I thought that tainted suppling wasn't that same thing to supplement as Yoel

4333
01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:34.553
Romero head,

4334
01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:38.820
I believe it was that same thing to Rome and they have the same manager so it,

4335
01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:40.530
so their manager didn't say,

4336
01:44:40.531 --> 01:44:40.681
Hey,

4337
01:44:40.681 --> 01:44:41.281
wait a minute,

4338
01:44:41.281 --> 01:44:41.881
Joe Ramiro,

4339
01:44:41.881 --> 01:44:45.140
you maybe you shouldn't take this because I don't know 100% and I'm,

4340
01:44:45.141 --> 01:44:47.460
I'm just talking at anyway,

4341
01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:49.020
even if that's not the case,

4342
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:50.460
as a manager you would say,

4343
01:44:50.461 --> 01:44:54.360
I think from now on you should buy only products that are on a list.

4344
01:44:54.630 --> 01:44:56.700
A don't do anything else anymore.

4345
01:44:56.701 --> 01:44:57.600
Just to make sure.

4346
01:44:57.601 --> 01:44:58.434
Because people,

4347
01:44:58.710 --> 01:44:59.790
you know where the smoke is fine.

4348
01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:00.631
That's what people think.

4349
01:45:00.631 --> 01:45:03.780
It's always like got 40 I was very happy with Yoel Romero when he,

4350
01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:05.580
when he brought a product,

4351
01:45:05.581 --> 01:45:07.890
I say that's the first guy who actually does that,

4352
01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:08.430
right?

4353
01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:09.300
They took the product,

4354
01:45:09.330 --> 01:45:12.160
got it off the market because it wasn't there and he was cleared.

4355
01:45:12.161 --> 01:45:12.420
I said,

4356
01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:12.661
okay,

4357
01:45:12.661 --> 01:45:13.540
finally I would've,

4358
01:45:13.610 --> 01:45:15.000
<v 3>Tim means did the same thing.</v>

4359
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:17.370
Tim Means tested positive and then he found it also,

4360
01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:18.480
we found it on the shelf.

4361
01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:20.880
They did an independent test of it and they said,

4362
01:45:20.881 --> 01:45:21.150
Yep,

4363
01:45:21.150 --> 01:45:21.983
it's in this stuff.

4364
01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:23.880
That's a real common thing.

4365
01:45:24.090 --> 01:45:27.690
A lot of baseball players are tested positive for the exact same thing that John

4366
01:45:27.691 --> 01:45:28.524
tested for.

4367
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:31.020
Apparently it's in a bunch of different supplements,

4368
01:45:31.290 --> 01:45:34.260
but you get it in trace elements are a trace amounts,

4369
01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:34.441
you know,

4370
01:45:34.441 --> 01:45:37.350
you're not getting like big amounts and a lot of it comes from,

4371
01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:39.630
they take the same Vat in,

4372
01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:40.140
you know,

4373
01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:40.651
China,

4374
01:45:40.651 --> 01:45:44.700
wherever they make that shit and they'll make some steroids and then they'll go

4375
01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:47.490
in and out but do a shitty job of cleaning it out and then they'll make some

4376
01:45:47.491 --> 01:45:48.261
creatine in there.

4377
01:45:48.261 --> 01:45:49.730
It's like the gluten free products,

4378
01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:50.161
you know,

4379
01:45:50.161 --> 01:45:55.150
because sometimes they use a machine that has product with gluten in there and

4380
01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.010
then it's painted.

4381
01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:56.700
It's like that.

4382
01:45:56.700 --> 01:45:57.060
Yeah,

4383
01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:58.140
it definitely can be.

4384
01:45:58.170 --> 01:45:59.100
It definitely can be.

4385
01:45:59.460 --> 01:45:59.641
You know,

4386
01:45:59.641 --> 01:46:01.200
I've heard a bunch of crazy stories.

4387
01:46:01.201 --> 01:46:04.350
One of the craziest one was they think that cocaine,

4388
01:46:04.351 --> 01:46:09.330
sometimes they cut with creatine and creatine is often infected with this

4389
01:46:09.331 --> 01:46:12.030
steroid that it's often tainted cause you're,

4390
01:46:12.031 --> 01:46:12.271
you know,

4391
01:46:12.271 --> 01:46:15.900
you're getting cheap creatine from China and they use creatine to cut cocaine

4392
01:46:15.901 --> 01:46:16.290
with,

4393
01:46:16.290 --> 01:46:17.070
I got a good idea.

4394
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:18.420
Don't do cocaine if you're a fighter.

4395
01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.051
Wait a minute.

4396
01:46:19.051 --> 01:46:20.190
That's just crazy.

4397
01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:22.290
You're just crazy.

4398
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:23.280
I didn't even make sense.

4399
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:24.001
Don't do coke.

4400
01:46:24.001 --> 01:46:25.020
When Katie come back,

4401
01:46:25.021 --> 01:46:25.854
when it come back.

4402
01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:26.580
Joe,

4403
01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:27.240
I don't know.

4404
01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:29.250
I don't think they've done is hearing yet.

4405
01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:30.270
Oh Man.

4406
01:46:30.330 --> 01:46:31.021
What a talent.

4407
01:46:31.021 --> 01:46:32.010
What a waste.

4408
01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:34.170
He did the California hearing.

4409
01:46:34.171 --> 01:46:37.380
But I think that the Nevada state athletic commission and you saw a,

4410
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:39.270
I think that's in April sometime.

4411
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:41.480
<v 0>I really hope we're gonna see him soon.</v>

4412
01:46:41.481 --> 01:46:43.100
I really hope he turns his life right.

4413
01:46:43.101 --> 01:46:43.490
I truly,

4414
01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:44.260
I truly the best.

4415
01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:44.451
Yeah,

4416
01:46:44.451 --> 01:46:45.081
he's the best.

4417
01:46:45.081 --> 01:46:47.110
I mean the impact that he can have on on,

4418
01:46:47.111 --> 01:46:49.330
on kits and on everything going out as a,

4419
01:46:49.331 --> 01:46:51.060
if he trains for four fights,

4420
01:46:51.061 --> 01:46:51.840
four more years.

4421
01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:52.080
Yeah,

4422
01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.190
just beat everybody.

4423
01:46:53.670 --> 01:46:54.390
I then go out.

4424
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:56.400
<v 3>I think he can still do it to yank it.</v>

4425
01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:58.230
You still come back and maybe you know,

4426
01:46:58.260 --> 01:46:59.820
hope it's clear.

4427
01:46:59.850 --> 01:47:04.200
One thing is clear from his test is that whatever he took was a tiny trace

4428
01:47:04.201 --> 01:47:06.930
amount and it must have been accidental.

4429
01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:07.621
Must have been.

4430
01:47:07.621 --> 01:47:11.280
This is according to Jeff Novitsky because if you look at right before that

4431
01:47:11.281 --> 01:47:11.760
test,

4432
01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:12.750
he tests negative,

4433
01:47:13.050 --> 01:47:17.130
he tests positive for the tiniest amount and then he tests negative again right

4434
01:47:17.131 --> 01:47:17.900
afterwards.

4435
01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:19.140
She is a tiny,

4436
01:47:19.141 --> 01:47:19.840
tiny,

4437
01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:23.280
so it has to be an accident and it definitely didn't have any performance

4438
01:47:23.281 --> 01:47:24.270
enhancing benefit.

4439
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.740
Well the levels that he took,

4440
01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.240
they're talking about trace amounts,

4441
01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:31.180
<v 0>but you see this is where comes in play what he did before and that's why he's</v>

4442
01:47:31.181 --> 01:47:32.560
going to penalize you see,

4443
01:47:32.561 --> 01:47:35.020
so you're all responsible for your actions.

4444
01:47:35.021 --> 01:47:35.850
That's what's happening now.

4445
01:47:35.850 --> 01:47:38.410
And this was the first time that title two which is so crazy.

4446
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.801
I know.

4447
01:47:38.801 --> 01:47:39.191
But you know,

4448
01:47:39.191 --> 01:47:40.810
if somebody has a chance to do it back,

4449
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:41.950
what a comeback that will be.

4450
01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:43.130
<v 3>I think he can do it.</v>

4451
01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:43.240
Hey,

4452
01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:44.080
get 100%.

4453
01:47:44.230 --> 01:47:44.471
I mean,

4454
01:47:44.471 --> 01:47:45.330
you think about his wit,

4455
01:47:45.370 --> 01:47:46.840
his victory over Daniel Cormier,

4456
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:47.703
the way he did it,

4457
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:49.090
that left high kick and then

4458
01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:49.661
<v 0>puts it away.</v>

4459
01:47:49.661 --> 01:47:51.530
He set it up that entire fight.

4460
01:47:51.531 --> 01:47:52.364
He was setting it up.

4461
01:47:52.610 --> 01:47:55.750
But I think that when he came back and the before the last break that I said,

4462
01:47:55.751 --> 01:47:55.991
okay,

4463
01:47:55.991 --> 01:47:56.830
now we can let it fly.

4464
01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:58.330
I think you set them up enough.

4465
01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:01.810
I love that men making a pattern and then breaking the better.

4466
01:48:01.811 --> 01:48:02.170
And that's,

4467
01:48:02.170 --> 01:48:03.610
I love that style of fighting.

4468
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:04.320
Yeah.

4469
01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:04.750
Yeah.

4470
01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:05.320
Nah Man.

4471
01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:07.120
I mean he's such a talent.

4472
01:48:07.390 --> 01:48:07.750
I mean,

4473
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:08.500
and just,

4474
01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:12.040
but isn't it funny how some of those guys that are so talented are also so self

4475
01:48:12.041 --> 01:48:12.874
destructive,

4476
01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:14.013
so common.

4477
01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:14.913
It's because,

4478
01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:15.210
oh no,

4479
01:48:15.210 --> 01:48:15.400
no,

4480
01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:19.600
but it's not only that it's talented and because they're talented propels them

4481
01:48:19.601 --> 01:48:22.210
up in the limelight and suddenly they become somebody.

4482
01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:23.590
And it's like I said with corner,

4483
01:48:23.591 --> 01:48:24.590
you've got all the say.

4484
01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:25.840
Nobody says no to you.

4485
01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:26.500
Right.

4486
01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:28.120
And if you have that constantly,

4487
01:48:28.121 --> 01:48:29.860
24 seven around you,

4488
01:48:30.130 --> 01:48:30.340
yeah.

4489
01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:31.180
You start becoming,

4490
01:48:31.530 --> 01:48:32.470
you think you're God,

4491
01:48:32.471 --> 01:48:34.960
you can start doing things that other people can and you can.

4492
01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:36.670
That's the worst part.

4493
01:48:36.671 --> 01:48:36.810
Yeah.

4494
01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:37.870
I mean you look,

4495
01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:38.981
I mean he,

4496
01:48:38.981 --> 01:48:40.300
that he didn't go to jail.

4497
01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:41.291
Think about it.

4498
01:48:41.291 --> 01:48:42.124
What he did.

4499
01:48:42.210 --> 01:48:42.611
All right,

4500
01:48:42.611 --> 01:48:45.750
hitting the woman and an the drugs out of the car and the woman was pregnant and

4501
01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:46.361
she was injured.

4502
01:48:46.361 --> 01:48:46.750
I mean,

4503
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:48.190
there's a serious thing.

4504
01:48:48.250 --> 01:48:50.110
A normal person would have been in jail.

4505
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:51.010
Right?

4506
01:48:51.010 --> 01:48:51.843
So,

4507
01:48:52.110 --> 01:48:56.040
and with the money situation and how we changed suddenly with core me a

4508
01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:56.651
Wednesday where you know,

4509
01:48:56.651 --> 01:48:56.831
where,

4510
01:48:56.831 --> 01:49:00.820
where they filmed them at the interview and they kept it rolling and they didn't

4511
01:49:00.821 --> 01:49:01.720
know they were willing and he starts,

4512
01:49:01.721 --> 01:49:01.871
hey,

4513
01:49:01.871 --> 01:49:02.740
how much money you have?

4514
01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:03.940
I got so much more money.

4515
01:49:03.941 --> 01:49:04.421
I got this,

4516
01:49:04.421 --> 01:49:06.010
I got this and I go deal.

4517
01:49:06.011 --> 01:49:06.641
What are you doing?

4518
01:49:06.641 --> 01:49:07.474
What is right?

4519
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:09.040
It's a weird thing to say,

4520
01:49:09.041 --> 01:49:09.880
but then again,

4521
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:10.570
you think of it,

4522
01:49:10.570 --> 01:49:11.140
he's the,

4523
01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:13.060
he was the youngest champion also ever,

4524
01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:13.720
right?

4525
01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:14.081
I mean,

4526
01:49:14.081 --> 01:49:14.861
the guy is young.

4527
01:49:14.861 --> 01:49:15.161
I mean,

4528
01:49:15.161 --> 01:49:19.290
I was an idiot and that I wasn't needed when I started at 28 I was still the

4529
01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:20.010
grown up.

4530
01:49:20.010 --> 01:49:21.400
I was completely crazy.

4531
01:49:21.401 --> 01:49:25.600
So that's why I never blame people because I know I wasn't a complete idiot.

4532
01:49:25.770 --> 01:49:26.310
<v 3>Right.</v>

4533
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.491
Well,

4534
01:49:26.491 --> 01:49:28.320
you have a great perspective on it because of the,

4535
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:29.010
yeah,

4536
01:49:29.010 --> 01:49:29.311
yeah.

4537
01:49:29.311 --> 01:49:30.031
You've been there.

4538
01:49:30.031 --> 01:49:30.930
You know what it's like,

4539
01:49:30.931 --> 01:49:35.010
and you were a fucking wild man and now you're very calm except for when new

4540
01:49:35.011 --> 01:49:36.030
occasionally punch the table.

4541
01:49:36.210 --> 01:49:36.510
Yeah.

4542
01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:39.940
13 hours is too long for the commercial shoots done do that.

4543
01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:41.820
I know what that's like though.

4544
01:49:41.821 --> 01:49:43.310
They keep on wanting you to do it again.

4545
01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:44.071
You get an angry like,

4546
01:49:44.071 --> 01:49:44.880
fuck.

4547
01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:45.330
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

4548
01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:45.620
yeah.

4549
01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:45.711
No,

4550
01:49:45.711 --> 01:49:48.010
it's an ego thing too because said it's fine,

4551
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.330
but because they said would be,

4552
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:51.190
you know that now it's in my head.

4553
01:49:51.191 --> 01:49:51.461
I go,

4554
01:49:51.461 --> 01:49:52.900
I just want to do it for them,

4555
01:49:53.170 --> 01:49:54.850
so I don't feel as bad as I go.

4556
01:49:54.851 --> 01:49:55.220
Hey Man.

4557
01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:55.610
Right,

4558
01:49:55.610 --> 01:49:56.350
right.

4559
01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:57.161
It's just pushing it.

4560
01:49:57.161 --> 01:49:58.990
It's just saying no a little sooner.

4561
01:49:58.991 --> 01:49:59.770
That's the trick.

4562
01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:01.480
Do you miss inside MMA?

4563
01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:01.931
Yeah,

4564
01:50:01.931 --> 01:50:02.500
I do.

4565
01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:03.490
I never,

4566
01:50:03.670 --> 01:50:05.800
and I told this always when I had to show,

4567
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:08.290
there's never been a show when we were,

4568
01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:08.691
uh,

4569
01:50:08.691 --> 01:50:09.524
that imagined.

4570
01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:10.271
Today was Friday.

4571
01:50:10.271 --> 01:50:11.980
I had to film never ever.

4572
01:50:11.981 --> 01:50:12.370
I thought,

4573
01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:13.690
I wish I could stay home tonight.

4574
01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:17.140
I always wanted it to go and meet who everybody was.

4575
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:18.303
Whoever was there.

4576
01:50:18.430 --> 01:50:19.300
I love that show.

4577
01:50:19.630 --> 01:50:20.261
It was great.

4578
01:50:20.261 --> 01:50:21.280
You saw the new talent.

4579
01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:22.270
That's where Conor Mcgregor,

4580
01:50:22.271 --> 01:50:22.511
you know,

4581
01:50:22.511 --> 01:50:25.390
come center and it was just starting and interviewing him.

4582
01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:25.751
It's great.

4583
01:50:25.751 --> 01:50:26.760
And any shitty old guys,

4584
01:50:26.770 --> 01:50:28.060
you don't fry.

4585
01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:28.933
And Coleman,

4586
01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:29.630
it was great.

4587
01:50:29.630 --> 01:50:30.463
There was a fun show.

4588
01:50:30.730 --> 01:50:31.563
What happened with it?

4589
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:32.950
I think just numbers.

4590
01:50:32.951 --> 01:50:33.401
I think it's,

4591
01:50:33.401 --> 01:50:33.701
you know,

4592
01:50:33.701 --> 01:50:35.890
nowadays with everything streaming you can,

4593
01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:36.431
you know,

4594
01:50:36.431 --> 01:50:39.070
there is no breaking news for us or it has to happen on Friday.

4595
01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:43.600
Should come along and reboot it and give you a show and just do it online where

4596
01:50:43.601 --> 01:50:44.800
anybody can get ahold of it.

4597
01:50:44.801 --> 01:50:46.500
Dude on youtube yet,

4598
01:50:46.501 --> 01:50:47.770
but then also do it every day,

4599
01:50:47.771 --> 01:50:48.604
but make it,

4600
01:50:48.730 --> 01:50:50.860
you can't compete with a very short or Gamma Ray.

4601
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:51.850
We can while you can,

4602
01:50:51.851 --> 01:50:52.420
because that's,

4603
01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.530
that's happening now.

4604
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:55.690
So you need to show a live show it like,

4605
01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:56.710
like a podcast,

4606
01:50:56.711 --> 01:50:59.620
but you need to do it in every day or when there's breaking news.

4607
01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:00.310
Yeah.

4608
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:01.270
Well every day is,

4609
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:01.690
I mean,

4610
01:51:01.690 --> 01:51:02.261
fuck man.

4611
01:51:02.261 --> 01:51:03.280
If you did it every day,

4612
01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:06.310
it would just take off if somebody just figured out how to do it and got you

4613
01:51:06.311 --> 01:51:07.150
into a studio.

4614
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.871
Yeah,

4615
01:51:07.871 --> 01:51:08.470
but you know what?

4616
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.981
We're waiting.

4617
01:51:08.981 --> 01:51:11.380
First of all for the Kevin can wait.

4618
01:51:11.381 --> 01:51:12.490
If that goes to a third season,

4619
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:13.690
I'm going to have to have that.

4620
01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:16.090
Then I got 11 shows with the professional fighters league.

4621
01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:17.500
I just started karate combat,

4622
01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:18.520
you know,

4623
01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:20.020
so I'm good.

4624
01:51:20.050 --> 01:51:21.940
I would like to keep the free time.

4625
01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:22.551
What do you,

4626
01:51:22.551 --> 01:51:24.220
are you a regular and Kevin can wait?

4627
01:51:24.670 --> 01:51:24.891
Yeah,

4628
01:51:24.891 --> 01:51:25.630
I will.

4629
01:51:25.630 --> 01:51:26.560
I'm a regular on the show,

4630
01:51:26.561 --> 01:51:28.270
but not a regular of the show.

4631
01:51:28.271 --> 01:51:29.080
That would be,

4632
01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:30.280
if this goes to a third season,

4633
01:51:30.281 --> 01:51:33.110
I become the Casper that then,

4634
01:51:33.150 --> 01:51:33.880
then it will be there.

4635
01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:35.020
So you play on the show.

4636
01:51:35.290 --> 01:51:35.980
His neighbor,

4637
01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:37.040
like last year I had exist,

4638
01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:38.800
16 or 17 episodes.

4639
01:51:39.490 --> 01:51:39.821
The guy,

4640
01:51:39.821 --> 01:51:40.391
crazy guy,

4641
01:51:40.391 --> 01:51:41.500
rude girl from Holland,

4642
01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:42.321
you know,

4643
01:51:42.321 --> 01:51:43.990
and he's not the smartest guy,

4644
01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:45.730
not the sharpest knife in the drawer.

4645
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.660
It's very funny it.

4646
01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:47.650
That's fucking great.

4647
01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:47.980
Yeah.

4648
01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:49.480
That's so cool that Kevin did that.

4649
01:51:49.481 --> 01:51:50.314
That's very cool.

4650
01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:53.710
And it happened because once inside MMA stopped,

4651
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:54.191
he said,

4652
01:51:54.191 --> 01:51:56.320
now you can finally do an appearance on our show,

4653
01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:59.260
because they were filmed Friday nights in front of a live audience.

4654
01:51:59.280 --> 01:51:59.560
Right.

4655
01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:00.910
So I could never be on a show.

4656
01:52:00.911 --> 01:52:02.170
So I did a guest appearance.

4657
01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:03.430
The writer's liked it.

4658
01:52:03.431 --> 01:52:04.121
They got me back.

4659
01:52:04.121 --> 01:52:05.170
And then I did two,

4660
01:52:05.530 --> 01:52:05.920
three,

4661
01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:08.230
four shows the first season at the end.

4662
01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:09.431
And then he called me.

4663
01:52:09.431 --> 01:52:09.611
He said,

4664
01:52:09.611 --> 01:52:09.731
dude,

4665
01:52:09.731 --> 01:52:10.121
they love you.

4666
01:52:10.121 --> 01:52:11.230
They want you for next year.

4667
01:52:11.231 --> 01:52:13.510
So there's also awesome.

4668
01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:16.300
I sat this 21 years ago,

4669
01:52:16.301 --> 01:52:16.691
I believe,

4670
01:52:16.691 --> 01:52:19.510
against a George Gross when he interviewed me for sure.

4671
01:52:19.511 --> 01:52:23.260
Doc was just started Chertok 21 years ago.

4672
01:52:23.261 --> 01:52:24.550
And my dream job,

4673
01:52:25.090 --> 01:52:26.140
he asked me about,

4674
01:52:26.141 --> 01:52:27.160
and long story short,

4675
01:52:27.310 --> 01:52:29.860
my dream job will be to work in an American Sitcom.

4676
01:52:29.861 --> 01:52:30.670
I said,

4677
01:52:30.670 --> 01:52:31.240
and he said,

4678
01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:32.080
you don't want to fight.

4679
01:52:32.081 --> 01:52:32.371
I said,

4680
01:52:32.371 --> 01:52:32.600
no,

4681
01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:33.433
I did all that.

4682
01:52:34.330 --> 01:52:36.190
I just want to make people laugh.

4683
01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:37.290
Look at you there.

4684
01:52:37.330 --> 01:52:37.961
Wow.

4685
01:52:37.961 --> 01:52:39.070
That's hilarious.

4686
01:52:39.330 --> 01:52:40.150
It's so funny.

4687
01:52:40.150 --> 01:52:41.920
What a what a life that is,

4688
01:52:41.921 --> 01:52:42.191
man.

4689
01:52:42.191 --> 01:52:43.024
His Sitcom.

4690
01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.200
Everybody's happy.

4691
01:52:44.201 --> 01:52:44.591
Yeah.

4692
01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:45.500
It's such a good time.

4693
01:52:45.501 --> 01:52:46.100
I did that shit

4694
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:46.933
<v 2>for five years.</v>

4695
01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:47.450
Yep.

4696
01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:48.230
Yeah.

4697
01:52:48.230 --> 01:52:52.430
It's interesting what happened with the wood they were going to reboot it.

4698
01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:54.590
Will was the factor fear factor.

4699
01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:56.690
They did reboot it with ludicrous.

4700
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:57.081
Oh,

4701
01:52:57.081 --> 01:52:57.341
so,

4702
01:52:57.341 --> 01:52:57.441
oh,

4703
01:52:57.441 --> 01:52:59.010
so they didn't know I wasn't going to do.

4704
01:52:59.011 --> 01:52:59.381
Oh yeah.

4705
01:52:59.381 --> 01:53:01.490
You're too busy to write jokes over the place.

4706
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:02.010
I don't want,

4707
01:53:02.010 --> 01:53:03.050
I was got into a fight.

4708
01:53:03.051 --> 01:53:03.884
Remember that?

4709
01:53:03.930 --> 01:53:05.000
Oh yeah.

4710
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:06.200
Some silly guy.

4711
01:53:07.130 --> 01:53:08.940
Poor fuck crazy people.

4712
01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:09.800
Yeah.

4713
01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:10.090
That's,

4714
01:53:10.090 --> 01:53:13.670
that's a problem with a reality show because you're dealing with all these wacky

4715
01:53:13.671 --> 01:53:14.840
people that are trying to get famous.

4716
01:53:14.841 --> 01:53:16.040
Whereas you're on a sitcom.

4717
01:53:16.041 --> 01:53:18.760
You dealing with the other people that you're working with on a daily basis.

4718
01:53:18.761 --> 01:53:20.570
Like when I was on news radio,

4719
01:53:20.590 --> 01:53:20.781
you know,

4720
01:53:20.781 --> 01:53:23.060
we were like a weird little dysfunctional family.

4721
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:23.661
You know?

4722
01:53:23.661 --> 01:53:24.740
That's what happens in those,

4723
01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:27.410
those sitcoms sets get very close to each other.

4724
01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:28.273
Yeah.

4725
01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:28.911
It's a lot of,

4726
01:53:28.911 --> 01:53:29.151
it's a,

4727
01:53:29.151 --> 01:53:29.531
it's a,

4728
01:53:29.531 --> 01:53:30.231
it's a great job,

4729
01:53:30.231 --> 01:53:30.620
man.

4730
01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:32.120
It really is like the,

4731
01:53:32.190 --> 01:53:33.320
I'll show funny.

4732
01:53:33.450 --> 01:53:34.120
Yeah,

4733
01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:34.730
yeah,

4734
01:53:34.730 --> 01:53:35.210
yeah.

4735
01:53:35.210 --> 01:53:36.200
I'm laughing the whole time.

4736
01:53:36.201 --> 01:53:39.200
If people would have a camera on me and if I'm laying in bed going over the

4737
01:53:39.201 --> 01:53:39.890
script,

4738
01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:40.161
I mean,

4739
01:53:40.161 --> 01:53:40.640
it's all like,

4740
01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:43.400
I didn't realize that almost everything they say is funny.

4741
01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:45.590
You don't catch that when you're watching,

4742
01:53:45.591 --> 01:53:47.030
but that's why the rebrand is so good.

4743
01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:48.620
Every time you see new jokes,

4744
01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:51.480
but pretty much everything is tied in together.

4745
01:53:51.481 --> 01:53:52.740
If every single line you go,

4746
01:53:52.741 --> 01:53:53.210
oh my God,

4747
01:53:53.210 --> 01:53:55.760
this comes back from that scene before it's,

4748
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:56.810
it's all tied in.

4749
01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:59.600
People don't realize what a good standup comedian Kevin is too.

4750
01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:00.140
Yeah.

4751
01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:01.370
He's a very good writer.

4752
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:02.151
He's a very,

4753
01:54:02.151 --> 01:54:03.050
very good writer.

4754
01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:04.100
Very funny guy.

4755
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:05.121
Yeah,

4756
01:54:05.121 --> 01:54:05.840
a lot of fun.

4757
01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:09.110
He just doesn't have enough a standup specials out where people don't appreciate

4758
01:54:09.111 --> 01:54:10.100
how good he really is.

4759
01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:11.840
He just going to do for the Netflix now.

4760
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:13.540
I'm happy.

4761
01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:13.880
Yeah.

4762
01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:14.990
I think you already filmed it.

4763
01:54:15.250 --> 01:54:16.700
Did you reach out to I think shit,

4764
01:54:16.710 --> 01:54:16.930
dude.

4765
01:54:16.930 --> 01:54:18.620
I went to a few because once we were there,

4766
01:54:18.621 --> 01:54:19.370
he started,

4767
01:54:19.370 --> 01:54:19.611
you know,

4768
01:54:19.611 --> 01:54:20.444
going to some,

4769
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:21.303
uh,

4770
01:54:21.310 --> 01:54:22.550
a standup places,

4771
01:54:22.610 --> 01:54:22.851
you know,

4772
01:54:22.851 --> 01:54:24.850
to start practicing because she,

4773
01:54:24.851 --> 01:54:25.760
it was out for a little bit.

4774
01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:26.541
And,

4775
01:54:26.541 --> 01:54:26.961
uh,

4776
01:54:26.961 --> 01:54:27.794
an album,

4777
01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:29.150
we started out together,

4778
01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:33.310
we have the same manager and I got him hooked up with my manager back in like

4779
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:36.650
fucking 1993 or some shit.

4780
01:54:36.651 --> 01:54:40.400
I don't even remember what year it was when Kevin and I were buddies in New

4781
01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:40.790
York.

4782
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:41.351
I remember you,

4783
01:54:41.351 --> 01:54:43.030
you used roommates right now.

4784
01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:43.400
Windows.

4785
01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:44.300
We never lived together,

4786
01:54:44.301 --> 01:54:45.530
but we were just like,

4787
01:54:46.190 --> 01:54:47.060
we were friends.

4788
01:54:47.061 --> 01:54:49.010
We were both like in her early,

4789
01:54:49.011 --> 01:54:49.791
early twenties.

4790
01:54:49.791 --> 01:54:50.750
We were just starting out.

4791
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:54.410
He told me that he will used to watch the PR Pancras with you.

4792
01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:56.240
And that's how he knew me.

4793
01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:58.250
And so when I came to America,

4794
01:54:58.251 --> 01:55:00.080
I had this management right away calling.

4795
01:55:00.081 --> 01:55:00.381
They say,

4796
01:55:00.381 --> 01:55:00.531
Hey,

4797
01:55:00.531 --> 01:55:01.251
who wants to meet you?

4798
01:55:01.251 --> 01:55:01.970
So that was cool.

4799
01:55:01.970 --> 01:55:02.571
That is cool.

4800
01:55:02.571 --> 01:55:02.781
Yeah.

4801
01:55:02.781 --> 01:55:04.700
Kevin used to watch all that shit with me.

4802
01:55:04.710 --> 01:55:08.480
We used to watch Pancrase and the early k one fights and everything,

4803
01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:08.860
man.

4804
01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:09.380
Yeah.

4805
01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:09.650
Yeah.

4806
01:55:09.650 --> 01:55:12.190
Kevin is a fucking serious martial artists too.

4807
01:55:12.290 --> 01:55:13.950
People have no clue that yeah,

4808
01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:15.380
he can hit man.

4809
01:55:15.381 --> 01:55:17.790
He don't fucking power does a cool thing.

4810
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:18.830
W we're shooting,

4811
01:55:18.831 --> 01:55:19.700
here comes the boom.

4812
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:22.500
He at the end with Christoph Sisinsky when you lift,

4813
01:55:22.501 --> 01:55:23.450
some are for the arm bar,

4814
01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:24.080
right?

4815
01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:24.950
So to see this go,

4816
01:55:24.951 --> 01:55:28.790
I'm going to bring in into crane with a cable show day because it needs to be

4817
01:55:28.791 --> 01:55:29.690
controlled of course,

4818
01:55:29.691 --> 01:55:30.524
for the film.

4819
01:55:30.770 --> 01:55:31.760
So he's asking,

4820
01:55:31.761 --> 01:55:32.150
he says,

4821
01:55:32.150 --> 01:55:32.271
oh,

4822
01:55:32.271 --> 01:55:32.631
by the way,

4823
01:55:32.631 --> 01:55:33.470
can I have your attention?

4824
01:55:33.471 --> 01:55:36.380
So all these actual was out there and it says crystal have laid down.

4825
01:55:36.590 --> 01:55:38.060
So crystal puts him in an arm bar.

4826
01:55:38.150 --> 01:55:39.680
He lifts Christof up above his head,

4827
01:55:39.681 --> 01:55:41.180
puts him back for lifts him up above us,

4828
01:55:41.181 --> 01:55:41.871
had breaks them back,

4829
01:55:41.871 --> 01:55:42.170
does it,

4830
01:55:42.170 --> 01:55:43.010
does it three times in a,

4831
01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:43.680
he says,

4832
01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:44.130
did you see

4833
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:44.640
<v 0>that?</v>

4834
01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:46.380
I just wanted to bring it out there so people get to see,

4835
01:55:46.381 --> 01:55:47.670
because now the cable comes in.

4836
01:55:47.671 --> 01:55:49.520
Otherwise everybody says that I can't do it.

4837
01:55:49.770 --> 01:55:50.670
And everybody was like,

4838
01:55:50.671 --> 01:55:51.360
what?

4839
01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:52.230
He just did that.

4840
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:56.880
[inaudible] he's a gorilla and his speed and his punches.

4841
01:55:56.881 --> 01:55:57.691
If you see him,

4842
01:55:57.691 --> 01:55:58.770
that's not sped up.

4843
01:55:58.860 --> 01:55:59.170
No,

4844
01:55:59.170 --> 01:55:59.851
it on a,

4845
01:55:59.851 --> 01:56:00.720
here comes the boom.

4846
01:56:00.721 --> 01:56:02.480
I mean the way he's hitting what he's doing,

4847
01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:04.800
the very first time I was training him,

4848
01:56:04.801 --> 01:56:06.420
I remember coming home and telling my,

4849
01:56:06.421 --> 01:56:06.840
if she says,

4850
01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:07.341
and I said,

4851
01:56:07.341 --> 01:56:07.500
man,

4852
01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:08.101
he's a big guy,

4853
01:56:08.101 --> 01:56:12.750
but toady listens to every little thing I say and he will do it immediately.

4854
01:56:12.751 --> 01:56:13.470
I mean his body,

4855
01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:13.711
mind,

4856
01:56:13.711 --> 01:56:15.890
body connection is really good and it is reliable.

4857
01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:17.810
It had eye coordination as well as good.

4858
01:56:17.811 --> 01:56:18.850
Really good goal for two.

4859
01:56:19.810 --> 01:56:20.201
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

4860
01:56:20.201 --> 01:56:21.034
He's a good dude.

4861
01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:22.210
I've known that guy forever.

4862
01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:23.710
All right boss.

4863
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:24.580
Hi.

4864
01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:26.050
I think we should wrap this up.

4865
01:56:26.051 --> 01:56:29.650

4868
01:56:37.690 --> 01:56:39.040
Give them your email address.

4869
01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:40.060
Boom.

4870
01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:41.710
And they hook it up and uh,

4871
01:56:41.711 --> 01:56:42.490
it should be fun.

4872
01:56:42.490 --> 01:56:43.420
And these guys,

4873
01:56:43.421 --> 01:56:44.830
where are the athletes coming from?

4874

<v 0>All over the world.</v>

4875
01:56:46.621 --> 01:56:47.510
That's the greatest thing.

4876
01:56:47.511 --> 01:56:48.470

4877
01:56:48.471 --> 01:56:48.801

4878
01:56:48.801 --> 01:56:50.620

4879
01:56:50.630 --> 01:56:52.210
because they listened to the fans.

4880
01:56:52.211 --> 01:56:53.044

4882
01:56:53.511 --> 01:56:54.290

4884
01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:56.690
I heard it on Joe Rogan,

4885
01:56:56.691 --> 01:56:57.381

4887
01:56:57.591 --> 01:56:59.900

4888
01:56:59.901 --> 01:57:00.561

4889
01:57:00.561 --> 01:57:00.980

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:01.191

4891
01:57:01.191 --> 01:57:02.024

4892
01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:03.560
Start emailing him,

4893
01:57:04.010 --> 01:57:06.140
just talk about it because they throw it into group,

4894
01:57:06.170 --> 01:57:07.340
they'll listen to the people.

4895
01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:07.821

4896
01:57:07.821 --> 01:57:07.940
