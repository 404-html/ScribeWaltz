00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

3
00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:08.080
<v Speaker 1>this process of biofeedback was discovered in the late sixties on cat cats in a</v>

4
00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:08.681
<v Speaker 1>tourist Lee,</v>

5
00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>bad instruction followers,</v>

6
00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:10.864
<v Speaker 1>right fuckers,</v>

7
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.070
<v Speaker 1>So you're never going to,</v>

9
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.540
<v Speaker 1>this is not a cognitive process.</v>

10
00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Cats didn't try to make it.</v>

11
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.031
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

12
00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:19.690
<v Speaker 1>cat's got a dropper of milk whenever their brainwaves it up in one direction.</v>

13
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Milk came out a dropper and they learned over time to produce more of this</v>

14
00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>brainwave that gave them the milk dropper.</v>

15
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.353
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

16
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.900
<v Speaker 1>fascinate.</v>

17
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>And then six months of this,</v>

18
00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:29.230
<v Speaker 1>this one experiment that a,</v>

19
00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:31.090
<v Speaker 1>a Dr. Barry Sterman did in the late sixties,</v>

20
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.200
<v Speaker 1>six months later,</v>

21
00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:35.110
<v Speaker 1>he pulled a bunch of cats out of his subject pool to do a,</v>

22
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:37.390
<v Speaker 1>a rocket fuel exposure experiment.</v>

23
00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:38.021
<v Speaker 1>NASA had said,</v>

24
00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:38.171
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

25
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:38.381
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

26
00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:40.000
<v Speaker 1>our astronauts are getting really sick.</v>

27
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.070
<v Speaker 1>They're getting nauseous.</v>

28
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.090
<v Speaker 1>How dangerous is this?</v>

29
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:43.271
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 1>hydrazine stuff we're using as rocket fuel.</v>

31
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Could you please expose a bunch of animals to it and see,</v>

32
00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.630
<v Speaker 1>how much it takes to kill them,</v>

34
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.911
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

36
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:51.041
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

37
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>or what the dose response curve is.</v>

38
00:00:52.871 --> 00:00:55.840
<v Speaker 1>And so doctor Sterman at Ucla in the late sixties,</v>

39
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 1>it was exposing cats to increasing levels of rocket fuel vapors and found that</v>

41
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.421
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

42
00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:01.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:02.830
<v Speaker 1>they planted a little more,</v>

44
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:04.600
<v Speaker 1>they stumbled a little more,</v>

45
00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:05.530
<v Speaker 1>they cried.</v>

46
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.820
<v Speaker 1>And then like seizure,</v>

47
00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:07.241
<v Speaker 1>coma,</v>

48
00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:07.810
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

49
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 1>this nice linear,</v>

50
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:08.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:11.260
<v Speaker 1>with increasing dose except of the cats,</v>

52
00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:13.060
<v Speaker 1>he was using a certain subset,</v>

53
00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:14.740
<v Speaker 1>like six of 30 or something,</v>

54
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>refuse to have seizures.</v>

55
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And the whole curve of unstable brain was pushed to the right.</v>

56
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't figure out why until he realized,</v>

57
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.721
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

58
00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:23.200
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

59
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I use these same six cats in a previous experiment to increase their brainwaves</v>

60
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>in this one brainwave that,</v>

61
00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:31.480
<v Speaker 1>that I thought was a nice target to go after.</v>

62
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.790
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that brainwave is the anti seizure brainwave.</v>

63
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.441
<v Speaker 1>When you train it up,</v>

64
00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:38.620
<v Speaker 1>you have decreased dramatically decreased seizure activity in the brain.</v>

65
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.900
<v Speaker 1>And so he found this,</v>

66
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 1>this brainwave was sort of Metta stable,</v>

68
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.701
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

69
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:44.071
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

70
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>in encouraging brain activity.</v>

71
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 1>And His lab manager at the time was a medication,</v>

72
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>uncontrolled,</v>

73
00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:50.764
<v Speaker 1>epileptic,</v>

74
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.260
<v Speaker 1>having like tens of seizures a month,</v>

75
00:01:53.261 --> 00:01:55.240
<v Speaker 1>which is basically a death sentence.</v>

76
00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Your brain will,</v>

77
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:01:55.901 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Swiss cheese over time and you'll,</v>

79
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.510
<v Speaker 1>you'll have major,</v>

80
00:01:58.511 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>major longterm problems.</v>

81
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

82
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.690
<v Speaker 1>and she demanded,</v>

83
00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>he built her a biofeedback machine to train up this brainwave.</v>

84
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.450
<v Speaker 1>And over the next year or two they did some training and after a couple of years</v>

85
00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:08.410
<v Speaker 1>she went off all meds.</v>

86
00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:09.244
<v Speaker 1>I'm a seizure free.</v>

87
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

88
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.530
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

89
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 1>And about that time Barry Sterman is funding was all pulled.</v>

90
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

91
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.991
<v Speaker 1>He probably,</v>

92
00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:21.220
<v Speaker 1>he submitted a paper to Epilepsia the journal and suddenly his uh,</v>

93
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.780
<v Speaker 1>government funding all vanished.</v>

94
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.470
<v Speaker 1>So the conspiracy theorist,</v>

95
00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:26.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 1>ideas start to mount.</v>

98
00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:29.224
<v Speaker 1>When you think about,</v>

99
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Speaker 1>the late sixties and big drug companies not wanting a non drug intervention for</v>

101
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:34.810
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy out there,</v>

102
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.220
<v Speaker 2>there are pockets are loaded with so much fucking doe and they have been so</v>

103
00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:44.221
<v Speaker 2>conditioned by a game that dehumanizes people to the point where they no longer</v>

104
00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:50.290
<v Speaker 2>see giant swaths of humans and other countries as people.</v>

105
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.801
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

106
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:53.590
<v Speaker 2>it is important to realize that these wolves that you're talking about,</v>

107
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.930
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about a different species here,</v>

108
00:02:55.931 --> 00:02:56.530
<v Speaker 2>friend.</v>

109
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.530
<v Speaker 2>If you look at like what's going on in the UK with these organized pedophile</v>

110
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:01.901
<v Speaker 2>rings,</v>

111
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to consist of people in the highest level of government.</v>

112
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember who it was.</v>

113
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 2>One of the investigators said,</v>

114
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be built into the system in some way.</v>

115
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

116
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 2>look it up.</v>

117
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 2>It's scary fucking shit man.</v>

118
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

119
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 2>So when you look ahead,</v>

120
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 2>avoided that stuff cause it bumped me out when I saw those,</v>

121
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.901
<v Speaker 2>those stores.</v>

122
00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 2>But that's what they're saying.</v>

123
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.823
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're saying.</v>

124
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 2>But here's the difference.</v>

125
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.451
<v Speaker 2>Here's the difference.</v>

126
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 2>And that's horrifying to imagine cause you know this,</v>

127
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 2>we hear it.</v>

128
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny to hear with the UK government and people are like,</v>

129
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

130
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 2>But now you hear about a priest doing it and people are like,</v>

131
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:35.831
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

132
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 2>that just happens.</v>

133
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're looking at an,</v>

134
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

135
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 2>an organized system that has as part of the destructive,</v>

136
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 2>a result that it reaps on the planet.</v>

137
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Also psychically wounding children in the worst way possible.</v>

138
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 2>So this is a,</v>

139
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.813
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

140
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that that the,</v>

141
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 2>the reason that that isn't as grim and horrible as it sounds is cause the</v>

142
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:07.021
<v Speaker 2>difference today as opposed to 30 years ago is that we get to say it in front of</v>

143
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.800
<v Speaker 2>however many zillions of people listen to your podcast and it,</v>

144
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 2>that info instantly travels around the world 30 years ago.</v>

145
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 2>If you think that if there truly is an organized group of pedophiles that have</v>

146
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 2>as their membership,</v>

147
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 2>high ranking government officials,</v>

148
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 2>not just probably in the UK but in the United States too,</v>

149
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 2>if that really does exist,</v>

150
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 2>it didn't just start today or last week or two years ago.</v>

151
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 2>That's been around for a long,</v>

152
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

153
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.350
<v Speaker 2>So the difference between back then and now is that shit is getting everywhere.</v>

154
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 2>It's everyone on planet earth is aware of this investigation.</v>

155
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 2>You can't get that genie back in the bottle.</v>

156
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Even though I think a lot of people are trying,</v>

157
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 2>they're saying that the whistle blowers for for this,</v>

158
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.241
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

159
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 2>are not going to have immunity.</v>

160
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.080
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing that the government,</v>

161
00:04:58.081 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 2>instead,</v>

162
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.930
<v Speaker 2>if you're a whistle blower for this weird ring of pedophiles,</v>

163
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 2>no immunity,</v>

164
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 2>you're going to jail too.</v>

165
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.160
<v Speaker 2>So they're like squelching.</v>

166
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 2>There seems to be an element that is trying to push this shit down of course,</v>

167
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 2>because if it's true that there that some speculate that even members of the</v>

168
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 2>royal family could be involved in this shit.</v>

169
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

170
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>look it up.</v>

171
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.431
<v Speaker 2>I usually,</v>

172
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a deep dark David Lynch level twin peaks shit coaster.</v>

173
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.670
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

174
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.503
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

175
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.813
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

176
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 2>that might be one of the best descriptions ever.</v>

177
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.393
<v Speaker 2>Say that again.</v>

178
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.540
<v Speaker 2>A deep dark David Lynch level shit goes to</v>

179
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 2>twin peaks style worms deep in the ground.</v>

180
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

181
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.511
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

182
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:49.090
<v Speaker 2>but the positive thing is they're getting exposed.</v>

183
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.760
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about us tie steel cups for grappling competition?</v>

184
00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 2>So they're not sure they're getting outlawed and a lot of grappling competitions</v>

185
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 2>because they that extra leverage,</v>

186
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 1>they're like a fulcrum point.</v>

187
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Like a leverage point.</v>

188
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.941
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

189
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Lynn,</v>

190
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 1>then everybody's got a free ball,</v>

191
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.130

192
00:06:09.901 --> 00:06:11.520
<v Speaker 1>And I'm saying you see him,</v>
