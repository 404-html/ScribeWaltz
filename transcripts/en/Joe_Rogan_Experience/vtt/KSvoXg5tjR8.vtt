1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience and I've known you forever.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I knew you back when you were having a real hard time with standup,</v>

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.920
<v Speaker 1>which to me is fascinating because you the only guy that I've ever met that was</v>

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:15.290
<v Speaker 1>having like a really hard time with standup and then add a nowhere.</v>

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Like you hit a switch.</v>

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>You went from having a hard time with stand up to Beano fucking murderer.</v>

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.973
<v Speaker 1>We would,</v>

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>it was almost like you like you fucking pass through a doorway or something.</v>

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Like within two years of you working at the store,</v>

10
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you just figured it out is figured it out one night and we were up on stage and</v>

11
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 1>we're were in the back rather and you were up on stage.</v>

12
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>We were watching you go like Damn Joey Diaz just turn a fucking corner.</v>

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>You just figured out how to be funny.</v>

14
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>You figured out who you were up there.</v>

15
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.430
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird when you get into anything.</v>

16
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 2>There's always the Jesus of the improving.</v>

17
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.141
<v Speaker 2>Of coming here,</v>

19
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:52.974
<v Speaker 2>I'm showing up,</v>

20
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.460
<v Speaker 2>this is just isn't working,</v>

21
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.750
<v Speaker 2>and then one day out of the fucking blue pop pow.</v>

22
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 2>It just starts working and it's really weird with stand up.</v>

23
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.670
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to go to sleep,</v>

24
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 2>you want to go home and keep riding and riding.</v>

25
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.780
<v Speaker 2>And then I became infatuated from 95 to [inaudible] 98 but I had so many other</v>

26
00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 2>things going on.</v>

27
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.001
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

28
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 2>I had so many fucking things going on that I couldn't really focus,</v>

29
00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:23.830
<v Speaker 2>focus and then I moved to La and I had all of these distractions.</v>

30
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 2>You have all these stupid distractions when you first moved to La and you're a</v>

31
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:29.980
<v Speaker 2>comic age and sees this,</v>

32
00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:30.731
<v Speaker 2>that this,</v>

33
00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:31.480
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

34
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.620
<v Speaker 2>and then one day you just,</v>

35
00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:33.940
<v Speaker 2>something hits you and it goes,</v>

36
00:01:33.941 --> 00:01:35.470
<v Speaker 2>these motherfuckers don't matter.</v>

37
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Nothing really matters.</v>

38
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I've got to go up there and speak what's in my heart and you just start going</v>

39
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.670
<v Speaker 2>and little by little,</v>

40
00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:45.100
<v Speaker 2>once you find your voice you become a savage.</v>

41
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.911
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

42
00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:46.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

43
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.130
<v Speaker 2>it's like a shark tasting blood.</v>

44
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:49.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like anything else.</v>

45
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.740
<v Speaker 2>When you get that taste,</v>

46
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.450
<v Speaker 2>you just go after it and,</v>

47
00:01:52.451 --> 00:01:55.120
<v Speaker 2>and you know the comedy store's the fucking comedy store man.</v>

48
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Once you get into comedy store.</v>

49
00:01:56.771 --> 00:01:58.420
<v Speaker 2>To me that's like,</v>

50
00:01:58.421 --> 00:02:00.070
<v Speaker 2>you know John [inaudible],</v>

51
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 2>that's the comedy store,</v>

52
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.180
<v Speaker 2>John Jacques Machado.</v>

53
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.060
<v Speaker 2>It's those up a high level that that's it.</v>

54
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a high level but especially in the two thousands</v>

55
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>down there there was,</v>

56
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>there was a some intense comedy that was going on for your company.</v>

57
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Ari coming up there and you coming up there,</v>

58
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>it was a really intense time</v>

59
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.381
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

60
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:22.640
<v Speaker 2>you go on stage and you get this.</v>

61
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 2>We had confidence that it's this fucking thing.</v>

62
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:30.440
<v Speaker 2>You just get stronger and stronger and the more people you go up in front of it</v>

63
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.230
<v Speaker 2>because then in the beginning they make you go up in front of people.</v>

64
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

65
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.880
<v Speaker 2>going up in front of Mitzi shore is nerve wracking and going on after they put</v>

66
00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:40.970
<v Speaker 2>you on after a lot of guys that were really fun and you're going up in front of</v>

67
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:41.571
<v Speaker 2>Mitzi shore,</v>

68
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:46.130
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea what that does to you at the six year mark going up.</v>

69
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.510
<v Speaker 2>I cannot describe it.</v>

70
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:51.500
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about it and I've written about that experience thousands of times</v>

71
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.100
<v Speaker 2>and nothing was more like I blacked out.</v>

72
00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 2>I had a blackout to go in front of Mitzi shore because I knew it was it for a</v>

73
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 2>guy like me and Mitzi shore turned me down.</v>

74
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.593
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

75
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.060
<v Speaker 2>I was going to go back to boulder,</v>

76
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 2>probably stab one of those motherfuckers without come out.</v>

77
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.751
<v Speaker 2>I would just,</v>

78
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 2>when you getting out now I would have been institutionalized.</v>

79
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 2>There's no turning back from that.</v>

80
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 2>It would have crushed my ego.</v>

81
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:17.104
<v Speaker 2>Her,</v>

82
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 2>her taking me gave me another five year reprieve in my life.</v>

83
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 2>I knew I got something to do for five more years before I go to jail for killing</v>

84
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:25.421
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>

85
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how I fell.</v>

86
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Did you really feel like you're going to do that?</v>

87
00:03:27.981 --> 00:03:28.661
<v Speaker 2>Because when I met you,</v>

88
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:29.520
<v Speaker 2>I never got that from,</v>

89
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.850
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

90
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

91
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 2>That's one part of the part of the,</v>

92
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.590
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

93
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.951
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

94
00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 2>the jump in my comedy was the day I wrote her the letter and I said,</v>

95
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:39.020
<v Speaker 2>you can't scam me no more.</v>

96
00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:39.800
<v Speaker 2>He want to take the kid,</v>

97
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.820
<v Speaker 2>take the fuck am I gonna fucking road.</v>

98
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.870
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about you called her up one day and told him,</v>

99
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

100
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.833
<v Speaker 2>I told her that,</v>

101
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

102
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.620
<v Speaker 2>that at the end of the day and I was being this,</v>

103
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 2>some people really can't handle the truth and sometimes you have to tell them,</v>

105
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.310
<v Speaker 2>and I had a talk to her and then talk to her again in [inaudible] 99 when I took</v>

106
00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:57.881
<v Speaker 2>that change,</v>

107
00:03:57.881 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 2>it was around 2000 and you met me in [inaudible] 97 it took me about three</v>

108
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:02.021
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

109
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 2>but one day in [inaudible] 99 before I went to bed,</v>

110
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I was clean for a couple of days,</v>

111
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 2>maybe three days.</v>

112
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 2>And I went to bed early and I had my,</v>

113
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:09.761
<v Speaker 2>which to me,</v>

114
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:10.091
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

115
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to fuck with this no more.</v>

116
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 2>It was one of these things that I was going into the lion's mouth.</v>

117
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.610
<v Speaker 2>I had a walk on a fine line with her because I wanted to be a part of that kid's</v>

118
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:21.071
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

119
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't looking that way and I wasn't gonna take her shit no more than one</v>

120
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:27.610
<v Speaker 2>morning I got up mice in her room and I went and got a calling card and I call</v>

121
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 2>that motherfucker and I just laid it out to her and I told her the opening line</v>

122
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:31.931
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

123
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:32.531
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget this,</v>

124
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 2>that listen between you and I,</v>

125
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 2>and she knew me.</v>

126
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

127
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:38.490
<v Speaker 2>if you want to fire,</v>

129
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 2>I would not pass on you.</v>

130
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Only contact I'm having with you is because of this child.</v>

131
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 2>So I pay for a separate phone in her room and I don't have to talk to you no</v>

132
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:48.304
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

133
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Cause she wanted what was killing me at that time when she wanted to take and</v>

134
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 2>change the child's name.</v>

135
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 2>And my position was when my father died,</v>

136
00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 2>my mom remarried.</v>

137
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 2>My poor dad that died.</v>

138
00:04:58.061 --> 00:04:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I had to keep his fucking name.</v>

139
00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 2>That was just something in my heart,</v>

140
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 2>so I always felt that that's let her become 18 I have to decide what the fuck</v>

141
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 2>she wants to write that was eating away at me and when they add no value,</v>

142
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 2>a name didn't have a value to me and this whole situation didn't have a valid to</v>

143
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

144
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Once I analyzed it and said,</v>

145
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 2>fuck this bitch and what she stands for,</v>

146
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 2>I turned that corner because I dropped luggage off.</v>

147
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing sometimes in comedy,</v>

148
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 2>sometimes in life you're just carrying around some luggage,</v>

149
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:26.141
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

150
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't let you move.</v>

151
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 2>The box is five feet,</v>

152
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 2>but the door is only three.</v>

153
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Sorry motherfucker and you got to drop that shit until you dropped that fucking</v>

154
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:35.660
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>

155
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 2>You ain't going to go through that door.</v>

156
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Too many people get locked into those relationships,</v>

157
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.560
<v Speaker 2>whether they're friendships,</v>

158
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 2>friendships with former ex,</v>

159
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 2>ex wife and husband,</v>

160
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:47.950
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call that relationship axes.</v>

161
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.610
<v Speaker 2>But they're like to deer with their fucking horns locked together and they can't</v>

162
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 2>separate and they fucking every game a push pull they fuck with each other on</v>

163
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:56.374
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>

164
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.771
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

165
00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I've known people that went through</v>

166
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>horrible divorces where,</v>

167
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>you could tell that like they would,</v>

169
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 1>they would like be setting up each other like,</v>

170
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:05.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:05.721
<v Speaker 1>fuck him,</v>

172
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>make him pay more,</v>

173
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

175
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

176
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>let's agree to one thing and then change the terms.</v>

177
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Just keep,</v>

178
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 1>keep the bills coming in.</v>

179
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.231
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

180
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I've heard people talk like</v>

181
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:14.710
<v Speaker 2>it's a horror show.</v>

182
00:06:14.711 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

183
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

184
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:16.600
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

185
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.010
<v Speaker 2>this was the bad end of the Joe that this is the already add the job in boulder</v>

186
00:06:21.011 --> 00:06:23.530
<v Speaker 2>that paid the most fit an educated schmuck like me.</v>

187
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.850
<v Speaker 2>I was working for a sports adviser and that you can make anywhere from 20 to</v>

188
00:06:27.851 --> 00:06:29.590
<v Speaker 2>60,000 to football seasons,</v>

189
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.483
<v Speaker 2>six months.</v>

190
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 2>You can make some cases.</v>

191
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.313
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

192
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.940
<v Speaker 2>There were some guys that make a hundred grand.</v>

193
00:06:33.941 --> 00:06:34.450
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

194
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.650
<v Speaker 2>I had a month in December.</v>

195
00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:37.810
<v Speaker 2>I made 25 grand working in the fucking phones.</v>

196
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.520
<v Speaker 2>You just got to get some fish.</v>

197
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Tibetans send you money.</v>

198
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Believe that is,</v>

199
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.830
<v Speaker 2>you're going to take them through the fucking bowl season.</v>

200
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.641
<v Speaker 2>Listen Bro,</v>

201
00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:49.150
<v Speaker 2>you want to make 50 it's going to cost you 20 go to Western Union.</v>

202
00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Send me 20,000 and we'll talk about sending.</v>

203
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.850
<v Speaker 2>So they're basically buying your knowledge on your knowledge,</v>

204
00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:56.080
<v Speaker 2>but you have buying your bullshit.</v>

205
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.250
<v Speaker 2>It's bad Karma also.</v>

206
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

207
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.780
<v Speaker 2>But this is what I was doing,</v>

208
00:06:58.781 --> 00:06:59.800
<v Speaker 2>so I knew this,</v>

209
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.460
<v Speaker 2>I knew this.</v>

210
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Aren't they come to la but see short old pass me.</v>

211
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the Improv pass has been,</v>

212
00:07:05.111 --> 00:07:06.370
<v Speaker 2>but my dream was Mitzi shore.</v>

213
00:07:06.371 --> 00:07:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck are you kidding?</v>

214
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.130
<v Speaker 2>My whole thing was the store from day one people told me to go to the fucking</v>

215
00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:13.330
<v Speaker 2>store and that's your house.</v>

216
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.410
<v Speaker 2>That was my fate.</v>

217
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:15.670
<v Speaker 2>If she turned me down,</v>

218
00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:17.170
<v Speaker 2>I would have probably gone back to Colorado.</v>

219
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Probably gotten to work over there.</v>

220
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.401
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

221
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:19.750
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

222
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.370
<v Speaker 2>you done sets in Seattle,</v>

223
00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:23.740
<v Speaker 2>you were doing and I couldn't go back to go to Seattle.</v>

224
00:07:23.741 --> 00:07:26.020
<v Speaker 2>I would've gone back to Colorado and tried to be a dad.</v>

225
00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:27.130
<v Speaker 2>And one day ago,</v>

226
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.410
<v Speaker 2>I know me one fucking day,</v>

227
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:30.880
<v Speaker 2>the car breaks down,</v>

228
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:32.360
<v Speaker 2>the snow went out.</v>

229
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.980
<v Speaker 2>You get one of those bill's overdue bill and that's it.</v>

230
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.280
<v Speaker 2>You bump into this fucking book and it gives you that attitude with his flip</v>

231
00:07:39.281 --> 00:07:40.114
<v Speaker 2>flops on.</v>

232
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.800
<v Speaker 2>I was going to run over this motherfucking,</v>

233
00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:43.210
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna do 50 fucking years.</v>

234
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.160
<v Speaker 2>So you know what,</v>

235
00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:46.000
<v Speaker 2>as much as I,</v>

236
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.320
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store has that much power in my life that her parents came along at</v>

237
00:07:50.321 --> 00:07:50.760
<v Speaker 2>the right time,</v>

238
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.850
<v Speaker 2>came along at the right time.</v>

239
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the people create that?</v>

240
00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like the big,</v>

241
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.481
<v Speaker 1>the big hippy,</v>

242
00:07:55.481 --> 00:07:56.314
<v Speaker 1>new age,</v>

243
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:56.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

244
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.920
<v Speaker 1>argument about lives that you create these possibilities in life,</v>

245
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:00.760
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

246
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.540
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for all these different events that are happening too.</v>

247
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:04.660
<v Speaker 1>They're not random events.</v>

248
00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:08.830
<v Speaker 1>These are events that are sort of created by your own intentions.</v>

249
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

250
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel that sometimes,</v>

251
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.333
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

252
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.090
<v Speaker 2>One thing I learned was that till you take responsibility,</v>

253
00:08:15.091 --> 00:08:16.050
<v Speaker 2>you ain't gonna move forward.</v>

254
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.540
<v Speaker 2>There's mother fuckers that get off the stage.</v>

255
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:20.880
<v Speaker 2>The audience sucks.</v>

256
00:08:20.881 --> 00:08:25.710
<v Speaker 2>The sound that I watched a guy eat the pie.</v>

257
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Shit.</v>

258
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Never quite fucking bombed.</v>

259
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:29.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

260
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.323
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

261
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.410
<v Speaker 2>And everything else.</v>

262
00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:34.620
<v Speaker 2>And until you come through that you can't really,</v>

263
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.650
<v Speaker 2>and that was big for me that I believe that it,</v>

264
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.950
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

265
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.730
<v Speaker 2>I go to bed now,</v>

266
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.181
<v Speaker 2>I go home,</v>

267
00:08:39.181 --> 00:08:39.931
<v Speaker 2>I put my feet up,</v>

268
00:08:39.931 --> 00:08:42.330
<v Speaker 2>I watch the news and I go to bed like nothing.</v>

269
00:08:42.331 --> 00:08:42.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

270
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.400
<v Speaker 2>20 years ago I didn't go to bed like nothing.</v>

271
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.150
<v Speaker 2>I had to shut my window a certain way and close my door,</v>

272
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.571
<v Speaker 2>shut away.</v>

273
00:08:48.571 --> 00:08:52.180
<v Speaker 2>And I couldn't leave the light on at night because I owed money to a drug deal.</v>

274
00:08:52.181 --> 00:08:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I robbed somebody.</v>

275
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 2>I created all those scenarios,</v>

276
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

277
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't make that kidnapping up.</v>

278
00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 2>I went there with a gun.</v>

279
00:08:58.921 --> 00:08:59.760
<v Speaker 2>I knew that I was doing,</v>

280
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 2>but it's funny that how quick the turnaround was between like 99 you know,</v>

281
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

282
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 2>it all just sort of stopped.</v>

283
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 2>It all stopped luggage and it kept stopping.</v>

284
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:10.651
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

285
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:12.170
<v Speaker 2>it kept stopping and keep getting better.</v>

286
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 2>What you're telling me is that I never did blog at after 2006 that's you're</v>

287
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 2>trying to tell me who me.</v>

288
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 2>That's you're trying to tell me.</v>

289
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.263
<v Speaker 2>Why would you say that?</v>

290
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.510
<v Speaker 2>The weirdest way to phrase that sentence.</v>

291
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.650
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done Boston.</v>

292
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 2>One day I went home,</v>

293
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.800
<v Speaker 2>one day I went home with a chick.</v>

294
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 2>So one day I went home and just stopped doing book.</v>

295
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:35.200
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're trying to tell me.</v>

296
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.043
<v Speaker 2>That was done that again.</v>

297
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying about being a criminal.</v>

298
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

299
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:38.401
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

300
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

301
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:38.820
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

302
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm busting your balls.</v>

303
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe what I'm fucking telling you.</v>

304
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:44.600
<v Speaker 2>That's nice.</v>

305
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 2>2006 one day I went,</v>

306
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 2>oh Brian.</v>

307
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.310
<v Speaker 2>One day I went home and just stopped doing cocaine.</v>

308
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 2>No Rehab,</v>

309
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:52.470
<v Speaker 2>no hug.</v>

310
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I didn't call nobody.</v>

311
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.020
<v Speaker 2>I didn't piss my ear.</v>

312
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.560
<v Speaker 2>I didn't give my life to our the Oba game.</v>

313
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:59.790
<v Speaker 2>There was none of that shit.</v>

314
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.110
<v Speaker 2>He'll,</v>

315
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.480
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

316
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.710
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck that shit is,</v>

317
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.421
<v Speaker 2>he never go.</v>

318
00:10:02.421 --> 00:10:03.254
<v Speaker 2>It was nothing,</v>

319
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.721
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

320
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 2>the Pho,</v>

321
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:04.560
<v Speaker 2>but game,</v>

322
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.480
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck that shit is.</v>

323
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.080
<v Speaker 2>So my point is that what happened was I dropped,</v>

324
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 2>I kept dropping the pain that I had and that luggage that I add,</v>

325
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:13.464
<v Speaker 2>I forced it out.</v>

326
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.050
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't fucking stop doing drugs.</v>

327
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.410
<v Speaker 2>I overcame whatever it was making me do those fucking drugs.</v>

328
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Society wasn't making me do drugs.</v>

329
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Obamacare.</v>

330
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.131
<v Speaker 2>How funny is that?</v>

331
00:10:23.131 --> 00:10:26.100
<v Speaker 2>They found heroin in the Bronx with Obamacare envelope.</v>

332
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:26.934
<v Speaker 2>Austin,</v>

333
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Boston man hysteric instead,</v>

334
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Obamacare on it was on heroin.</v>

335
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:34.890
<v Speaker 2>Obamacare,</v>

336
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.960
<v Speaker 2>like people would just let everything,</v>

337
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.020
<v Speaker 2>we create everything in a lot of wings,</v>

338
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 2>and this is random things that happen as well,</v>

339
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:41.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

340
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.071
<v Speaker 2>Because I broke this.</v>

341
00:10:42.071 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people wake up on the wrong side of fucking bed.</v>

342
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 2>They come at you and you got to stand your fucking ground and you got to say no</v>

343
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.490
<v Speaker 2>bitch that people get their feelings hurt.</v>

344
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

345
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

346
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.390
<v Speaker 2>I created a lot of the shit that happened in my life.</v>

347
00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:55.350
<v Speaker 2>There's no fucking way.</v>

348
00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.330
<v Speaker 2>You also have to stop silliness or it'll invade your life and ruin your quality</v>

349
00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:01.840
<v Speaker 2>of life if you don't get you get upset</v>

350
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.171
<v Speaker 1>at people.</v>

351
00:11:02.171 --> 00:11:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there's times where people are infringing on your happiness with your</v>

352
00:11:06.071 --> 00:11:07.180
<v Speaker 1>bullshit bullshit.</v>

353
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:07.991
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

354
00:11:07.991 --> 00:11:08.561
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

355
00:11:08.561 --> 00:11:10.960
<v Speaker 1>you need to learn your own for your own good.</v>

356
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.780
<v Speaker 1>You need to learn that what you're doing is like socially unacceptable.</v>

357
00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:14.021
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

358
00:11:14.021 --> 00:11:15.790
<v Speaker 1>you're passing it off on other people.</v>

359
00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:20.120
<v Speaker 1>You're passing off this shitty reality that you're trying to promote something</v>

360
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:20.441
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

361
00:11:20.441 --> 00:11:22.510
<v Speaker 1>you can get locked in a person like that,</v>

362
00:11:22.511 --> 00:11:23.261
<v Speaker 1>as we were saying before,</v>

363
00:11:23.261 --> 00:11:25.120
<v Speaker 1>with like bad relationships and then all of a sudden,</v>

364
00:11:25.121 --> 00:11:28.300
<v Speaker 1>like every day you're dealing with this person's nonsense,</v>

365
00:11:28.301 --> 00:11:30.400
<v Speaker 1>distortions and lies.</v>

366
00:11:30.401 --> 00:11:31.730
<v Speaker 1>And it can never trust.</v>

367
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Like who was it your fault.</v>

368
00:11:33.041 --> 00:11:33.241
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

369
00:11:33.241 --> 00:11:34.120
<v Speaker 1>it's never your fault,</v>

370
00:11:34.121 --> 00:11:34.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

371
00:11:34.341 --> 00:11:35.141
<v Speaker 1>And it's never your fault.</v>

372
00:11:35.141 --> 00:11:36.190
<v Speaker 1>It's always somebody else's fault.</v>

373
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.340
<v Speaker 1>And when you deal with people like that on a regular basis and you communicate</v>

374
00:11:39.341 --> 00:11:40.174
<v Speaker 1>with people like that,</v>

375
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.470
<v Speaker 1>it makes it incredibly difficult for you to live your life because you're</v>

376
00:11:44.471 --> 00:11:45.304
<v Speaker 1>constantly,</v>

377
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:49.540
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly like debating or dismissing bullshit.</v>

378
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.131
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

379
00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:50.831
<v Speaker 1>is this bullshit?</v>

380
00:11:50.831 --> 00:11:51.664
<v Speaker 1>It might be bullshit.</v>

381
00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:52.870
<v Speaker 1>And then somewhere along the line,</v>

382
00:11:52.871 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 1>you fuck this man,</v>

383
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.290
<v Speaker 1>I got to stop hanging out with this person.</v>

384
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:57.490
<v Speaker 1>This person's an asshole.</v>

385
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:58.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

386
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.280
<v Speaker 1>that person doesn't give a fuck about the truth.</v>

387
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:01.510
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a fuck about me.</v>

388
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.290
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

389
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 1>and I've had a few of those in my life.</v>

390
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And you just cut them loose and when you cut them loose,</v>

391
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.020
<v Speaker 1>like you're a way better person,</v>

392
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.530
<v Speaker 1>you like your life is free and easy.</v>

393
00:12:09.531 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

394
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

395
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.801
<v Speaker 1>it's not that.</v>

396
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm like constantly engage in conflict.</v>

397
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 1>It's that if you surround yourself with the wrong kind of people,</v>

398
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 1>you will be constantly engaged in conflict.</v>

399
00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Whether you want it or whether you have that intention or not.</v>

400
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not just about having the right intentions,</v>

401
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 1>you gotta make the right choices as to who you put in your world.</v>

402
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Because if you put a bunch of shitheads that don't care about evolving,</v>

403
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.980
<v Speaker 1>they don't care about getting it together.</v>

404
00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:35.110
<v Speaker 1>And all the trying to do is pass off of nonsense on you.</v>

405
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:36.843
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

406
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.200
<v Speaker 1>you've got to fucking,</v>

407
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.400
<v Speaker 1>you got a Shitty road.</v>

408
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.660
<v Speaker 1>You've got a Shitty road ahead of you</v>

409
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:41.360
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

410
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I used to love guns?</v>

411
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.320
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't a gun up like your buddy,</v>

412
00:12:45.321 --> 00:12:46.340
<v Speaker 2>but I loved guns.</v>

413
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.300
<v Speaker 2>I loved having them.</v>

414
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.253
<v Speaker 2>I love them.</v>

415
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.821
<v Speaker 2>And the same thing.</v>

416
00:12:49.821 --> 00:12:50.720
<v Speaker 2>One day I was like,</v>

417
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.240
<v Speaker 2>every time I carry a gun there's a problem.</v>

418
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:55.461
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

419
00:12:55.461 --> 00:12:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Put that out there almost.</v>

420
00:12:56.601 --> 00:12:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

421
00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like a magnet for other guns and you're not the only one that says that.</v>

422
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.311
<v Speaker 2>It's like a magnet.</v>

423
00:13:01.311 --> 00:13:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you when I carried a gun,</v>

424
00:13:02.691 --> 00:13:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I carry the Gulf for a very short time because I didn't like it.</v>

425
00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see the purpose for it.</v>

426
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice thing could use to try to be a tough guy,</v>

427
00:13:10.221 --> 00:13:12.980
<v Speaker 2>but all it's going to do is get you a fucking trouble.</v>

428
00:13:12.981 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Cause you pull that motherfucker wanting motherfuckers going to pull their mind.</v>

429
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:17.930
<v Speaker 2>You that real tough guys.</v>

430
00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.580
<v Speaker 2>And I knew that going in.</v>

431
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:20.600
<v Speaker 2>I fucking knew it.</v>

432
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.460
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to fire it at somebody.</v>

433
00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.110
<v Speaker 2>But I tell you what man,</v>

434
00:13:24.111 --> 00:13:25.940
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing how he used to go home at night and go,</v>

435
00:13:25.941 --> 00:13:27.740
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck just happened tonight?</v>

436
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Why did I have to go from my reach for my gun through it?</v>

437
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Why were they six other people in the room and a coke party with guns?</v>

438
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Because guns attract.</v>

439
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.830
<v Speaker 2>They're like fucking magnets.</v>

440
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.190
<v Speaker 2>And one day I got rid of all those guns.</v>

441
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.020
<v Speaker 2>It was like I lost 80 fucking pounds of drama.</v>

442
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:46.970
<v Speaker 2>The same thing 10 years ago,</v>

443
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.620
<v Speaker 2>this phone would be ringing with people that were asking me questions about,</v>

444
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

445
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.990
<v Speaker 2>how do you get roadwork?</v>

446
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:54.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

447
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.630
<v Speaker 2>why don't you take me on the fucking road?</v>

448
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.471
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

449
00:13:57.471 --> 00:14:01.430
<v Speaker 2>you can all these fucking people calling you with these questions and at the</v>

450
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.010
<v Speaker 2>same time they have low concern for you.</v>

451
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.330
<v Speaker 2>They really don't.</v>

452
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:06.560
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to pull you down,</v>

453
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.690
<v Speaker 2>especially in this fucking town.</v>

454
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.020
<v Speaker 2>If you let people pull you down,</v>

455
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.820
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what you're doing.</v>

456
00:14:10.821 --> 00:14:11.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not happening for me.</v>

457
00:14:11.811 --> 00:14:12.231
<v Speaker 2>What do you want?</v>

458
00:14:12.231 --> 00:14:13.070
<v Speaker 2>What do you want me to do?</v>

459
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.680
<v Speaker 2>You got like right and get on stage every fucking night.</v>

460
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:16.740
<v Speaker 2>What'd you do as well?</v>

461
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:17.960
<v Speaker 2>I went to my sister's wedding.</v>

462
00:14:17.961 --> 00:14:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Well go fuck your mother.</v>

463
00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:20.360
<v Speaker 2>Then go to the fucking wedding.</v>

464
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.660
<v Speaker 2>You were one of the last guys that picking that out to you were one of the best</v>

465
00:14:23.661 --> 00:14:24.150
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

466
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Birds might fucking core that people come up to you and put their lack of Vr.</v>

467
00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.830
<v Speaker 2>That I saw somebody,</v>

468
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.880
<v Speaker 2>but I started comedy with at the store 13 years ago.</v>

469
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.870
<v Speaker 2>I was going to screen or some stupid movie that my buddy was in.</v>

470
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.140
<v Speaker 2>My wife was sleeping.</v>

471
00:14:40.141 --> 00:14:40.271
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

472
00:14:40.271 --> 00:14:41.104
<v Speaker 2>let me go down there.</v>

473
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.700
<v Speaker 2>And as I was walking around the corner,</v>

474
00:14:43.701 --> 00:14:43.821
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

475
00:14:43.821 --> 00:14:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Joey and I went up and I go,</v>

476
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know who was.</v>

477
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.420
<v Speaker 2>And he was telling me what he was doing in front of their,</v>

478
00:14:50.421 --> 00:14:51.254
<v Speaker 2>and he was,</v>

479
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.043
<v Speaker 2>you hear about us.</v>

480
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

481
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.520
<v Speaker 2>and he was telling me,</v>

482
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

483
00:14:55.891 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 2>what he was doing there and what he was,</v>

484
00:14:57.291 --> 00:14:58.160
<v Speaker 2>where he was working.</v>

485
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:04.030
<v Speaker 2>And I drove back to fucking studio city with like tears in my eyes because he</v>

486
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:06.080
<v Speaker 2>had every opportunity that I had.</v>

487
00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:08.390
<v Speaker 2>He was a good luck and knew when he moved to this fucking town.</v>

488
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.831
<v Speaker 2>But the ham,</v>

489
00:15:09.831 --> 00:15:12.610
<v Speaker 2>he used to go to the store and drank and everything was high.</v>

490
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:18.380
<v Speaker 2>And now I'm supposed to feel guilty on the fucking one o one cause this fucking</v>

491
00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:21.290
<v Speaker 2>schmucks got a job working until fucking two in the morning.</v>

492
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Parking cars or something,</v>

493
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:24.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

494
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

495
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.510
<v Speaker 2>we all had the same opportunities here.</v>

496
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:26.781
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

497
00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:29.090
<v Speaker 1>there's people that feel like those people in your life to teach you that</v>

498
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:29.510
<v Speaker 1>lesson.</v>

499
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.710
<v Speaker 1>To see people fail and have regrets and see people not give 100% or not give it</v>

500
00:15:33.711 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 1>all their focus or give it all their honesty,</v>

501
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

502
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:36.861
<v Speaker 1>give it,</v>

503
00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:38.480
<v Speaker 1>give it who the fuck you really are.</v>

504
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:43.370
<v Speaker 1>We see those people and that regret is almost there to let us know like don't</v>

505
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:44.130
<v Speaker 1>ever let that happen.</v>

506
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.630
<v Speaker 2>As I was getting in my car,</v>

507
00:15:45.631 --> 00:15:48.660
<v Speaker 2>he made a coat and he was one of those guys.</v>

508
00:15:48.661 --> 00:15:51.090
<v Speaker 2>I always had to have that one comment that the store,</v>

509
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.730
<v Speaker 2>they may like a fucking comment.</v>

510
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.700
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say something about something.</v>

511
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.580
<v Speaker 2>It must have been nice to them blow all those years,</v>

512
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:00.780
<v Speaker 2>like something just,</v>

513
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:01.651
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

514
00:16:01.651 --> 00:16:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Like he's one of those guys that he's going to pull you down,</v>

515
00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:04.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

516
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.000
<v Speaker 2>He had a,</v>

517
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.450
<v Speaker 2>and I just got in the car and I said,</v>

518
00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:06.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

519
00:16:06.721 --> 00:16:10.650
<v Speaker 2>this is why that guy's parking cars and you know,</v>

520
00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the fucking road work and at least trying to make things happen.</v>

521
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.050
<v Speaker 2>This is why this guy's parking.</v>

522
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Fucking</v>

523
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.810
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy that I want to,</v>

524
00:16:16.811 --> 00:16:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I won't mention his name,</v>

525
00:16:17.681 --> 00:16:18.071
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

526
00:16:18.071 --> 00:16:18.181
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

527
00:16:18.181 --> 00:16:20.020
<v Speaker 1>you had warned me about him a long time ago,</v>

528
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.730
<v Speaker 1>long before it ever went real bad form.</v>

529
00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.460
<v Speaker 1>And then one time I was back in the east coast and the guy hadn't done comedy</v>

530
00:16:24.461 --> 00:16:28.000
<v Speaker 1>and he fucking the couple of years and he's like trying to get ahold of me to</v>

531
00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:28.834
<v Speaker 1>open up for me.</v>

532
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

533
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.890
<v Speaker 1>what are you just,</v>

534
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.890
<v Speaker 1>you just got to get back on stage after a couple of years and open up at the big</v>

535
00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:33.460
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

536
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Like really that's where you're going to do a Yeti fucking mind.</v>

537
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of weird request is that you have an uncommon in two years you</v>

538
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.760
<v Speaker 1>want to go up and a in front of a sold out club.</v>

539
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>

540
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.470
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

541
00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Like why would you think that you could just do that like you get,</v>

542
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:47.853
<v Speaker 1>but that's what they,</v>

543
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.800
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guys that didn't make any comedy that felt like they didn't</v>

544
00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:51.910
<v Speaker 1>make it because nobody helped him.</v>

545
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.640
<v Speaker 1>And I've heard that so many times.</v>

546
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that stupid argument like I wasn't there when the right group or if</v>

547
00:16:58.631 --> 00:16:59.770
<v Speaker 1>you're not in with the right group.</v>

548
00:16:59.771 --> 00:17:01.030
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to get roadwork like,</v>

549
00:17:01.031 --> 00:17:01.990
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

550
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.520
<v Speaker 1>What do you all you have to do is be funny.</v>

551
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.151
<v Speaker 1>If you're funny,</v>

552
00:17:04.151 --> 00:17:04.984
<v Speaker 1>people find you.</v>

553
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:05.470
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

554
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.480
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the easiest businesses of all time.</v>

555
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.970
<v Speaker 1>You get proven onstage for sure.</v>

556
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Easiest to understand.</v>

557
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:12.220
<v Speaker 1>This is how easy it works.</v>

558
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:13.240
<v Speaker 1>You'll go onstage,</v>

559
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.740
<v Speaker 1>you get to people to laugh,</v>

560
00:17:14.741 --> 00:17:15.574
<v Speaker 1>people notice.</v>

561
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Then they started offering your work.</v>

562
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:17.703
<v Speaker 1>It's that simple.</v>

563
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:21.970
<v Speaker 1>When you prove that you have a certain amount of time and you prove that you can</v>

564
00:17:21.971 --> 00:17:23.470
<v Speaker 1>consistently perform really well.</v>

565
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.880
<v Speaker 1>People want to give you some work.</v>

566
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:25.751
<v Speaker 1>They give you a little here,</v>

567
00:17:25.751 --> 00:17:26.620
