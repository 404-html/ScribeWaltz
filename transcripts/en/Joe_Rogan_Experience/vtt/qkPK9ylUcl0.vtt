00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel a lot better at doing this.</v>

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do to Kilimanjaro by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

3
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>on a bad foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah man.</v>

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>And a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend of mine who went to</v>

5
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He filmed a.</v>

6
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>He has a television show called</v>
<v Speaker 1>mediator.</v>

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>His name's Steven Rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a professional hunter and he went</v>

8
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:24.711
<v Speaker 1>to Bolivia and he lived with the Toumani</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of weeks and he brought</v>

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.170
<v Speaker 1>them shoes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

10
00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:26.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

11
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>try these shoes on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to have nothing to do</v>

12
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>with those shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like stupid things out of here because</v>

13
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>those people walk barefoot everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their feet.</v>

14
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>He said their feet don't look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody's feet.</v>

15
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all splayed out like their toes</v>

16
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:40.650
<v Speaker 1>are splayed out and there's like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thick,</v>

17
00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>thick padding underneath where they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically have their own shoes,</v>

18
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>like the calluses and the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their feet act as shoes.</v>

19
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.150
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't sound too attractive for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

20
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.220
<v Speaker 1>to have to attract abby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have feet like a heart and know what</v>

21
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I do is using my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to have like callouses</v>

22
00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>on the bottom of your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got very soft baby feet.</v>

23
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>So you really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

24
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:10.621
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

25
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:15.621
<v Speaker 1>My wife always does a self defeating</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

26
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you are going to do this barefoot.</v>

27
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to wear shoes at least?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

28
00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:24.551
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

29
00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing like that exists to go once</v>

30
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind over matter.</v>

31
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about frostbite at?</v>

32
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>I did the half marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barefoot.</v>

33
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.120
<v Speaker 1>You did beyond the polar circle at</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperatures even far more below than</v>

34
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my joy.</v>

35
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's possible?</v>

36
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.230
<v Speaker 1>There's any benefit from the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're walking so much or running and</v>

37
00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 1>then your body is heating up and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a positive effect on your skin?</v>

38
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is I'm very able to,</v>

39
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go way to tap into the hormonal</v>

40
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>system creating a adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

41
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 1>this fact where people are sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>refer to,</v>

42
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.390
<v Speaker 1>they lift up and mother because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>child is underneath that actually is the</v>

43
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:18.720
<v Speaker 1>mind staring directly into the reptilian</v>
<v Speaker 1>mode.</v>

44
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>That reptilian brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the primitive brain and that</v>

45
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>you have direct access to pure</v>
<v Speaker 1>adrenaline,</v>

46
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.570
<v Speaker 1>makes you able to do almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>inconceivable feet and accomplish it</v>

47
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>only any to write trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now because I have been so much into the</v>

48
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold is cold.</v>

49
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Is there a real force impact upon you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to learn how to connect</v>

50
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>within with your mind and you breathing</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the brainstem,</v>

51
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.620
<v Speaker 1>into this adrenaline to withstand this</v>
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>

52
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>The cold impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've learned it.</v>

53
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>So you're tapping in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're causing your body to produce more</v>

54
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>adrenaline and you're focusing on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas of your body that are contacting</v>

55
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>the snow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're focusing on the bottom of</v>

56
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>your feet.</v>

57
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

58
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.080
<v Speaker 1>And it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

59
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm still able to look around how nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>their sunset or the sunrise and and be.</v>

60
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.660
<v Speaker 1>So there is a margin even there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

61
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
<v Speaker 1>We just need to go back to belief and</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief there in means the</v>

62
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:30.511
<v Speaker 1>neurotransmitters and the neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those have sick notes and say churches.</v>

63
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.970
<v Speaker 1>So if you charge your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your buddy,</v>

64
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.620
<v Speaker 1>then if you're able to influence up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>DNA level,</v>

65
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 1>and we have proven this already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the aisle six,</v>

66
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>enter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>locating those,</v>

67
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to safe inflammation,</v>

68
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.500
<v Speaker 1>we could not find it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could not suppress the side against</v>

69
00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>the flammatory markers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we showed very effectively not me,</v>

70
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:03.871
<v Speaker 1>only a whole group of persons which are</v>
<v Speaker 1>trained just in four days to be able to</v>

71
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.020
<v Speaker 1>go into the DNA and create the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemistry consciously by breathing and</v>

72
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:15.721
<v Speaker 1>using the mind to fend off flammatory</v>
<v Speaker 1>markers a cost by say a bacteria inside.</v>

73
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.880
<v Speaker 1>So we are actually able to tap into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deepest of ours,</v>

74
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.710
<v Speaker 1>create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have control over adrenaline's trestle</v>

75
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>and go up to not only in the deepest</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the brain,</v>

76
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 1>but also in the DNA.</v>
