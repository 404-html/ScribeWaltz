00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 1>this is going to come a point in time where human beings have like a biological</v>

4
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>meeting and we decide now that we have genetic engineering,</v>

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>should we decide to continue with this shape?</v>

6
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Should we decide to continue with this shape?</v>

7
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:16.074
<v Speaker 1>What is love?</v>

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>What is beauty in the eye of the beholder?</v>

9
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Could we all be better off if we're flying jellyfish,</v>

10
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>they'd come up with this proposition to be able to replace a with a simple</v>

11
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:28.914
<v Speaker 1>prescription,</v>

12
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>any feelings of love or sex or affection that people need or want,</v>

14
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>it's all satiated.</v>

15
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:36.341
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

16
00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>you never have to worry about reclaiming that again and that the most harmonious</v>

17
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>shape for the universe,</v>

18
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Speaker 1>the most harmonious shape to coexist forever with a,</v>

19
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>an infinite lifespan is flying jellyfish.</v>

20
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>How long before we'd be all be flying jellyfish seven years.</v>

21
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>The way that thing just flew,</v>

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be that thing.</v>

23
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>I know it's threw it off a bridge,</v>

24
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.050
<v Speaker 1>which someone gets really just throw you off a bridge and you just show this.</v>

25
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.893
<v Speaker 1>And this is the,</v>

26
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>imagine that technology in 20 years where that thing is following you around all</v>

27
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 1>day long,</v>

28
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.023
<v Speaker 1>all night long.</v>

29
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that in the shape of Dicks,</v>

30
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>imagine once they figure out to the shape of a dick is really not perfect.</v>

31
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.901
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

32
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>And just like there's other shit that's wrong with people like the fact that so</v>

33
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>easy to knock us out.</v>

34
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

35
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>that's a big flaw.</v>

36
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.311
<v Speaker 1>Punched him in the chin.</v>

37
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>They go unconscious as a stupid flaw.</v>

38
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>What if they realize like dicks are good but have a seat.</v>

39
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.163
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you the new,</v>

40
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>we're going to show you the next level,</v>

41
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.501
<v Speaker 1>the next level,</v>

42
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>some sort of new thing.</v>

43
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>It gets inside you and just expands,</v>

44
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>expands like a fist.</v>

45
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>So in a few little dicks all around at Tube,</v>

46
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.200
<v Speaker 1>like the main Dick tube and it's spreads out like corn.</v>

47
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>And I want to talk a little decks inside.</v>

48
00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

49
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if your Dick was,</v>

50
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.393
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 1>this might be the dumbest thing I've ever said.</v>

52
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if your Dick was like an ear of corn and each one of those little</v>

53
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>kernels was another dick.</v>

54
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>And once your Dick got in there and we had dick was hard,</v>

55
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:11.851
<v Speaker 1>you dick got in there,</v>

56
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:14.870
<v Speaker 1>then all those little dicks would pop out and we would all like,</v>

57
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>they would all play music inside the girl's Vagina,</v>

58
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>not downtown,</v>

59
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.950
<v Speaker 1>downtown dumped.</v>

60
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>and that would be the thing,</v>

62
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>like girls could come the hardest.</v>

63
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>You've made the best music inside the vagina.</v>

64
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.181
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

65
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

66
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.523
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

67
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.723
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

68
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.841
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

69
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>that's a very important point.</v>

70
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>If you just assuming that the Dick shape that we have currently is the best,</v>

71
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>but if you got the dick shape we had currently and the ability to make music</v>

72
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:44.094
<v Speaker 1>with your deck,</v>

73
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.993
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

74
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

75
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.201
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

76

<v Speaker 1>don't look at me like crazy.</v>

77
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Trying to think what kind of music you mentioned Donk,</v>

78
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Donk,</v>

79
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.093
<v Speaker 1>Donk,</v>

80
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>some Beethoven Shit said a piano or a violin or mostly like drums,</v>

81
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

82
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

83
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Depends on what you're trying to accomplish.</v>

84
00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I could see Jamie playing pong.</v>

88
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Guys had a flirty play,</v>

89
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>a gym day that was one of the most intense title fights ever.</v>

90
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Roy McDonald got you mean they got,</v>

91

<v Speaker 1>he got so close to winning that title.</v>

92
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>He had Robbie Lawler almost knocked out.</v>

93
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>He head kicked him Dang dumb.</v>

94
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Robbie was wombling and then Robbie came back to stop them in the next round and</v>

95
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.380
<v Speaker 1>his nose exploded and he literally went down in pain and you could see him</v>

96
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>writhing on the floor and it looked like he was just trying to find some</v>

97
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>comfort.</v>

98
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Like the pain was so intense when that broken knows that he was just trying to</v>

99
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>find some kind of comfort.</v>

100
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Blood was everywhere and it was just two guys that push themselves to the brink.</v>

101
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately when you see a fight,</v>

129
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen in a fight of just like the most obvious expression of it,</v>

130
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.391
<v Speaker 1>of pain.</v>

131

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.061
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

148
00:04:47.061 --> 00:04:49.070
<v Speaker 1>he fought his heart out.</v>

149
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.990
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing left for vault of them.</v>

150
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.910
<v Speaker 1>They were so closely matched,</v>

151
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.200
<v Speaker 1>such a good fight.</v>

152
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.180
<v Speaker 1>And in Robbie,</v>

153
00:04:56.181 --> 00:05:01.181
<v Speaker 1>how about when he's screaming in victory and his lip is split open like a cleft</v>

154
00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:06.740
<v Speaker 1>palate has Lyft has split open this giant Gash in his lip.</v>

155
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Like look at them.</v>

156
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a sideways photo where you see like a profile picture of him roaring</v>

157
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.880
<v Speaker 1>with his lip split open and it's this hard to believe that this guy's,</v>

158
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.490
<v Speaker 1>that he fought like that.</v>

160
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.060
<v Speaker 1>He fought with his lip split wide.</v>

161
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:21.101
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

162
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>if there's a better picture of it,</v>

163
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Jamie for find it.</v>

164
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like a sideways angle of the side where you see the actual uh,</v>

165
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.611
<v Speaker 1>cut itself.</v>

166
00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:31.820
<v Speaker 1>But it was one of the most gruesome lip injuries I've ever seen.</v>

167
00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:32.221
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

168
00:05:32.221 --> 00:05:33.800
<v Speaker 1>it was the guy who won that,</v>

169
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.790
<v Speaker 1>those guys,</v>

170
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.020
<v Speaker 1>there is where it is.</v>

171
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Dana Dana apparently walked up from that side right there and said,</v>

172
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.761
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

173
00:05:40.761 --> 00:05:41.594
<v Speaker 1>don't talk.</v>

174
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.143
<v Speaker 1>Say Man.</v>

175
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

176
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean his lip was literally just a giant slice.</v>

177
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Like you get hit with a hatchet in the face.</v>

178
00:05:51.051 --> 00:05:51.651
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

179
00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:52.281
<v Speaker 1>It was a crazy,</v>

180
00:05:52.281 --> 00:05:52.611
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

181
00:05:52.611 --> 00:05:53.444
<v Speaker 1>crazy fight.</v>

182
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>And one of the most intense closely match title fights in the Welterweight</v>

183
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 1>Division is history.</v>

184
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

185
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.151
<v Speaker 2>I ever,</v>

186
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 2>it was about down to the wire,</v>

187
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I met a woman at one of my shows in Brooklyn.</v>

188
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 2>She had no hands or feet.</v>

189
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.213
<v Speaker 2>What happened to her?</v>

190
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

191
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 2>she came up to me after the show and she like wanted to like give me a hug.</v>

192
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:15.561
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

193
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:16.490
<v Speaker 2>you're so funny.</v>

194
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 2>And she had like these stuffs and she said,</v>

195
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 2>you reminded me of the girls who did my nails when I had hands.</v>

196
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.573
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

197
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

198
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 3>tape.</v>

199
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.860
<v Speaker 3>It was like racism,</v>

200
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

201
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:39.104
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

202
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.243
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

203
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.800
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking like I want to bring it up if I just met her any other way.</v>

204
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.920
<v Speaker 2>But since she brought up her hands,</v>

205
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.401
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

206
00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:50.350
<v Speaker 2>what happened to your hands?</v>

207
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.080
<v Speaker 2>And she said that she had,</v>

208
00:06:53.081 --> 00:06:53.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

209
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.270
<v Speaker 2>something wrong with her appendix went to the hospital and the doctor put the</v>

210
00:06:58.271 --> 00:06:59.104
<v Speaker 2>wrong name,</v>

211
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.330
<v Speaker 2>like mixed up her charts and they amputated her hands and her feet</v>

212
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.000
<v Speaker 2>when she was only supposed to get her appendix taken out or something.</v>

213
00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:10.834
<v Speaker 2>Very minor.</v>

214
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

215
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.690
<v Speaker 2>And then a few weeks after that comedy show where I met her,</v>

216
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.090
<v Speaker 2>I saw on the front page of the paper in New York,</v>

217
00:07:21.091 --> 00:07:22.330
<v Speaker 2>it said so and so,</v>

218
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.400
<v Speaker 2>or whatever her name was.</v>

219
00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:24.234
<v Speaker 2>I forgot her name.</v>

220
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

221
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.610
<v Speaker 2>given $14 million or whatever,</v>

222
00:07:26.611 --> 00:07:26.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

223
00:07:26.851 --> 00:07:29.010
<v Speaker 2>like the settlement for your hands and your feet.</v>

224
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.210
<v Speaker 2>I forget how much it was,</v>

225
00:07:30.211 --> 00:07:31.470
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

226
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.270
<v Speaker 2>it was maybe longer.</v>

227
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.250
<v Speaker 2>And I met her boyfriend</v>

228
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.640
<v Speaker 3>go and you mentioned dating that happening to your girlfriend and you're like,</v>

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.923
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

232
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.030
<v Speaker 2>So crazy.</v>

233
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:44.541
<v Speaker 2>I asked him,</v>

234
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:44.841
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

235
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:46.820
<v Speaker 2>how long have you guys been together?</v>

236
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 2>He was like a year when that happened.</v>

237
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

238
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:51.681

243
00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.340
<v Speaker 3>or maybe he went to the fucking hospital and switch the things on here.</v>

244
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.990
<v Speaker 3>She is the founder</v>

245
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.940
<v Speaker 4>all right there.</v>
