1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I've taught that story is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was telling a friend of mine about it,</v>

3
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.441
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.274
<v Speaker 1>the story of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were in Alberta and you shot an elk </v>

5
00:00:12.101 --> 00:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>and these wolves circled the elk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

6
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:16.024
<v Speaker 1>how many?</v>

7
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at first there was just the one,</v>

8
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 2>the one came in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one came in on us and I,</v>

9
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.353
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's one I do want to say off the </v>

10
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:28.714
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing that I always do as a hunter </v>

11
00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:34.420
<v Speaker 2>is I always buy a Predator tag if it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>available,</v>

12
00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 2>if I know that I can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

13
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 2>that I can buy a tag for coyotes or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves,</v>

14
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I always have one in my pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you do see,</v>

15
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're out there and they're out there </v>

16
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:45.304
<v Speaker 2>way more now and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is an exact reason why he got </v>

17
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:49.944
<v Speaker 2>to do it because literally we had an elk</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and next thing you know we're out </v>

18
00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 2>there kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

19
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.440
<v Speaker 2>getting it ready to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

20
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 2>to cut it up and stuff and get it out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and all sudden this big wolf comes</v>

21
00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

22
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 2>it comes in and I had spotted it and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't really being noisy.</v>

23
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.400
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up shooting that wolf and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of went off.</v>

24
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:14.710
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a bow there's no noise.</v>

25
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 2>So what we didn't realize was there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a pack there and that that was actually,</v>

26
00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:23.680
<v Speaker 2>it was an Alpha female is because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>size of it.</v>

27
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:24.514
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw the size of it is a big as me </v>

28
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.270
<v Speaker 2>and it actually went off and then we </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of thought,</v>

29
00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:32.560
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's freaking freaky.</v>

30
00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:33.394
<v Speaker 2>We'll then about 20 minutes later all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden we see another one and we see </v>

31
00:01:37.181 --> 00:01:39.940
<v Speaker 2>another one and we're kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy crap.</v>

32
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.313
<v Speaker 2>So we start moving into this draw and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them was like making like a </v>

33
00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:48.190
<v Speaker 2>noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like it was injured or something.</v>

34
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.750
<v Speaker 2>And I was like whimpering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're like,</v>

35
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.070
<v Speaker 2>what is the deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

36
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.173
<v Speaker 2>we were on high ground with the elk and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then we started moving down into this </v>

37
00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:58.810
<v Speaker 2>ravine because we saw the wolves down in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

38
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 2>And next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get down in there and I start looking</v>

39
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:06.430
<v Speaker 2>around and there's like hair on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trees.</v>

40
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:07.264
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it looked like that movie into </v>

41
00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:10.510
<v Speaker 2>the gray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gray,</v>

42
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.270
<v Speaker 2>the gray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what it looked like.</v>

43
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.133
<v Speaker 2>Liam Neeson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was like fricking Harry turds </v>

44
00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:17.650
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

45
00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:20.410
<v Speaker 2>there was like beds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was hair rubbed on the trees.</v>

46
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.640
<v Speaker 2>And I started looking around and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like holes dug in and I'm like,</v>

47
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 2>I literally look at my two buddies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were there with me and I said,</v>

48
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.810
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're fricking den like,</v>

49
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we had that elk was not too </v>

50
00:02:34.361 --> 00:02:35.141
<v Speaker 2>far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:35.974
<v Speaker 2>our elk wasn't too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shot an elk that they probably </v>

52
00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:40.240
<v Speaker 2>thought of as theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

53
00:02:40.241 --> 00:02:42.010
<v Speaker 2>they definitely thought of it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>theirs.</v>

54
00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

55
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.680
<v Speaker 2>they definitely thought that was theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then once we're down there all sudden</v>

56
00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:50.860
<v Speaker 2>we hear this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how were like down there,</v>

57
00:02:50.861 --> 00:02:51.694
<v Speaker 2>we hear this how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was definitely an Alpha because </v>

58
00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:55.840
<v Speaker 2>an Alphas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the how,</v>

59
00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.110
<v Speaker 2>it literally turns your blood instantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're right in on a true wolf howl.</v>

60
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like,</v>

61
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 2>so freaking low and deep and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like chills your blood.</v>

62
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

63
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

64
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 2>we're in their fricking Dan and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

65
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of looking down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

66
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well shot an elk.</v>

67
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 2>Then I shot that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got two arrows left.</v>

68
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

69
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 2>both my guides kind of had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

70
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 2>once we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

71
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:25.714
<v Speaker 2>there's wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like grabbed a gun and we kind of </v>

72
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 2>went down in there to see what was up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now this happens.</v>

73
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 2>A next thing after that Alpha sounded </v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

74
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

75
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

76
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.553
<v Speaker 2>And I mean 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 12 sounded off all the </v>

77
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 2>way around us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in,</v>

78
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

79
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 2>we're literally down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who's been in Alberta,</v>

80
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>you know that the farm land is level and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it falls into the river system.</v>

81
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 2>So we're literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the high ground,</v>

82
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a dozen wolves and we're in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle and we're like,</v>

83
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 2>what the crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just,</v>

84
00:03:58.871 --> 00:03:59.704
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get you back to a tree so we can all </v>

85
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:01.924
<v Speaker 2>spin around and we're sitting there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>next thing you know here comes to dogs </v>

86
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 2>on a full blown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking like full blown like this,</v>

87
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.250
<v Speaker 2>like front running coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it turned into chaos.</v>

88
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:16.084
<v Speaker 2>There was like bullets flying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's fricking arrows skipping </v>

89
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.324
<v Speaker 2>off junk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we ended up shooting both of those </v>

90
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.083
<v Speaker 2>wolves dead and there's a few gunfires </v>
<v Speaker 2>going off while I'm down to like one </v>

91
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Arrow left and I told the guy said how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many bullets you got?</v>

92
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I didn't,</v>

93
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.711
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:35.544
<v Speaker 2>I just grabbed the gun to couple bullets</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I didn't know were this was all </v>

95
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 2>going down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it can't,</v>

96
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to get outta here.</v>

97
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 2>So we started backing up and next thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know they,</v>

98
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.233
<v Speaker 2>the Alpha sounded off again and they all</v>
<v Speaker 2>reported this time there's only two or </v>

99
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 2>two less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So next thing I know I'm like kind of,</v>

100
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:58.140
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to back out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you say that,</v>

101
00:04:58.141 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second.</v>

102
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.770
<v Speaker 2>You say they reported there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>

103
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 2>they know that two were dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

104
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 2>all of them are Howlin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm certain that the first,</v>

105
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:08.464
<v Speaker 2>how was the Alpha male?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much saying is everyone in </v>

106
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 2>position because then they all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

107
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the way around.</v>

108
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden the two come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all hell breaks loose.</v>

109
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Then we're like the alpha sounds again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's in a different location.</v>

110
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.840
<v Speaker 2>He was actually to my left like right </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and it really close and I mean it's</v>

111
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 2>thick in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been there,</v>

112
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 2>you know how thick it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then they sound awful.</v>

113
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:44.311
<v Speaker 2>Now this time there's two less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm kind of looking,</v>

114
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 2>cause I know this wolf that sounded was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know it's the Alpha,</v>

115
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.870
<v Speaker 2>so I like grabbed my bow and I start </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda creeping over there.</v>

116
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.900

<v Speaker 2>That is exactly the face that I saw in </v>

128
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was head on.</v>

129
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:38.684
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't broad side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that face where he was literally </v>

<v Speaker 2>I had one arrow left on my string.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

134
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.980

<v Speaker 2>I knew at that moment it was like he was</v>

135
00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:58.671
<v Speaker 2>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's just right before that Jamie,</v>

142
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before that wolf picture,</v>

00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 2>there was another wolf picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>

144
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.113
<v Speaker 2>Look at that one man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got snow all over his face and his </v>

<v Speaker 2>Wools are amazing.</v>

148
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.133
<v Speaker 2>They're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the one thing people underestimate </v>

149
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:36.910
<v Speaker 2>about hunters is our respect for </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

150
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.090
<v Speaker 2>I freaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally respect him.</v>

151
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:41.924
<v Speaker 2>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I can tell you that other picture </v>

152
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 2>right there when you have that looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at you in the face,</v>

153
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.083
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was like fricking do or die </v>

154
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.023
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally looked at that thing and I </v>

155
00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 2>said out loud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

156
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to shoot you in theF and face </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't swear.</v>

157
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

158
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.660
<v Speaker 2>It's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my boy might listen.</v>

159
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 2>I remember I drew back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

160
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Like I literally drew back and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>anchored and that came into my peep.</v>

161
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:11.863
<v Speaker 2>And as soon means for people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a little circle that you </v>

162
00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:17.750
<v Speaker 2>look at through the string line lining </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with your site.</v>

163
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:21.320
<v Speaker 2>So I was literally lining up the shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lining up the shot,</v>

164
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.910
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as I kind of brought my shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>down to where that wolf was,</v>

165
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bolted.</v>

166
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he just like,</v>

167
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Ninja ad.</v>

168
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.660
<v Speaker 2>If they're that wise and that big and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that old,</v>

169
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 2>they've got to know what smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had to have known that you killed the</v>

170
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.144
<v Speaker 2>elk and they had to have known that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed those other two wolves that </v>

171
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:48.041
<v Speaker 2>chased you went after the ALC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he came in to to think,</v>

172
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.040
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've see you called the fight.</v>

173
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 2>We responded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's like sizing up.</v>

174
00:08:57.091 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lost.</v>

175
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I've lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to know what I'm going against.</v>

176
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:08.571
<v Speaker 2>He kind of came in and he fricking </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at us all and then that was it.</v>

177
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Good thing they can't count for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who you only had two hours.</v>

178
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two hours and two bullets.</v>

179
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Bullets the guy up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was bone chilling.</v>

180
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

181
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.140
<v Speaker 2>you and I both have friends that are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzlies cats.</v>

182
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.033
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cats are notorious for stalking hunters </v>

183
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I mean,</v>

184
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:31.270
<v Speaker 2>they are the ultimate hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

185
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 2>but grizzlies and wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

186
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:37.120
<v Speaker 2>there you have to be on guard that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

187
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 2>there's places now we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

188
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.360
<v Speaker 2>grizzlies are strongly becoming such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem when it comes to,</v>

189
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to be controlled.</v>

190
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:49.660
<v Speaker 2>They're just starting to get to be too </v>
<v Speaker 2>many for,</v>

191
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 2>especially for the food source.</v>
