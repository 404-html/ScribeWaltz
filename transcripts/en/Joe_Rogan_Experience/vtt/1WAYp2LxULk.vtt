00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Now they're judging everything you say.</v>

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>You've had that before.</v>

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.531
<v Speaker 1>I drink it.</v>

6
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>A lot of unknown bars and you just start like,</v>

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.071
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

8
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>here's one of my stories.</v>

9
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite doug stories is with the fucking boxing match and Vegas,</v>

10
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>and you were heckling and hold him down and fuck his face.</v>

11
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>It'll destroy his confidence.</v>

12
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>This is the prelims,</v>

13
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>prelims or this box listening audience.</v>

14
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand when you go to whatever his boxing or UFC,</v>

15
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>the undercard no one's there.</v>

16
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>They're all out getting drinks awaiting,</v>

17
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the thing that they don't understand to happen.</v>

18
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>That's at the end.</v>

19
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's dead silent.</v>

20
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Bingo Hall Church.</v>

21
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Silence.</v>

22
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>So you can heckle and from the back row.</v>

23
00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>But Joe Rogan good a second row,</v>

24
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>so it's absolutely quiet and we're in their heckling.</v>

25
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Let me take your fucking him in the ass.</v>

26
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.721
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

27
00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:07.801
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

28
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

29
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>We'll take it because I wasn't heckling at all because Douglas doesn't do</v>

30
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:12.924
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

31
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Joseph does marijuana.</v>

32
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Douglas does alcohol.</v>

33
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Joseph does marijuana.</v>

34
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Joseph's freaking out because Douglas Heckling ticket kind of fucking laugh.</v>

35
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.920
<v Speaker 1>You're the one who brought me in.</v>

36
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>So I'm kind of your responsibility.</v>

37
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

38
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>try making him come.</v>

39
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>That always knocks me out like a light.</v>

40
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Wait till two seconds to go and say you just got punked.</v>

41
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that one.</v>

42
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>It was a five fights in a row with no one in the arena.</v>

43
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>The boxers can hear you</v>

44
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

45
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

46
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.121
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

47
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

48
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>He's being too too humble.</v>

49
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Here he got.</v>

50
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>He started getting laughs and that became a problem.</v>

51
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Became a problem.</v>

52
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.350
<v Speaker 1>One of them,</v>

53
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

54
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it was holding down and fuck his face.</v>

55
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 1>That was the one that broke to waterfall.</v>

56
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.043
<v Speaker 1>The whole</v>

57
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>break his confidence.</v>

58
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Let me say something about Doug Stam.</v>

59
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Hope will heckle a boxing when he.</v>

60
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>He starts the right way.</v>

61
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.400
<v Speaker 1>It isn't just dive right into the holding down.</v>

62
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Fuck his face.</v>

63
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

64
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.970
<v Speaker 1>He starts with some light jabs and then he builds up and it gets more and more</v>

65
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>bizarre and then it got to the whole data and fuck his face.</v>

66
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.661
<v Speaker 1>But when he said,</v>

67
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>hold him down and fuck his face,</v>

68
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I remember just hearing people go,</v>

69
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit</v>

70
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>don can we showed up at some?</v>

71
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Don't remember the Don King Haeckel,</v>

72
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:49.060
<v Speaker 1>but don king showed up while you can still hear of my uncles and uh,</v>

73
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>what was the name of his movie?</v>

74
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Whatever,</v>

75
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>in America,</v>

76
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>only in America.</v>

77
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.163
<v Speaker 1>Can you,</v>

78
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.111
<v Speaker 1>can you,</v>

79
00:02:56.111 --> 00:02:56.291
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>yelled something only in America.</v>

81
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Can you fuck over you had so many,</v>

82
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.920
<v Speaker 1>but he was there and could hear every word I said.</v>

83
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

84
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.230
<v Speaker 1>I did a thought experiment a while back and I thought,</v>

85
00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:10.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.030
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because when I was,</v>

87
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.590
<v Speaker 1>when I was in college,</v>

88
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.390
<v Speaker 1>every one of my college buddies know me as Arnold,</v>

89
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>they don't even know me as mark.</v>

90
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.220
<v Speaker 1>They call me arnold because when we were in college there was a TV show called</v>

91
00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:25.760
<v Speaker 1>green acres and there was a pig on the show called Arnold Ziff.</v>

92
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.020
<v Speaker 1>And I could eat more than anybody in,</v>

93
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.650
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

94
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.750
<v Speaker 1>in the college I went to including the football team.</v>

95
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>And so people would call me Arnold Ziff.</v>

96
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.500
<v Speaker 1>And so I became Ahrens,</v>

97
00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Arnie Arnold for most of my life,</v>

98
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.650
<v Speaker 1>just because the amount of food,</v>

99
00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:41.060
<v Speaker 1>just because the amount of food I could eat.</v>

100
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.433
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

101
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>did you have like contests or is this just like,</v>

102
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.290
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>

103
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.970
<v Speaker 1>everybody knew it's like you're going to eat that dessert,</v>

104
00:03:46.971 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>you're going to eat those,</v>

105
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 1>you're going to eat that steak,</v>

106
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>you can have that.</v>

107
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

108
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.770
<v Speaker 1>but it was running 100 miles a week.</v>

109
00:03:51.771 --> 00:03:52.970
<v Speaker 1>I was skinny fat.</v>

110
00:03:52.971 --> 00:03:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I weighed 30 pounds less than I weigh now,</v>

111
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.060
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>

112
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.050
<v Speaker 1>the throughput was,</v>

113
00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.070
<v Speaker 1>was where it was.</v>

114
00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

115
00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.990
<v Speaker 1>and because I had leaky gut,</v>

116
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.010
<v Speaker 1>probably a lot of it just</v>

117
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.690
<v Speaker 1>went right out the button,</v>

118
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.413
<v Speaker 1>the button.</v>

119
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.261
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

120
00:04:06.261 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

121
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.923
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.080
<v Speaker 1>the thought experiment was that my whole life I sort of was guilty of this,</v>

123
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:16.910
<v Speaker 1>like how much food can I eat and not gain weight and not be uncomfortable.</v>

124
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.511
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

125
00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:17.870
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

126
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.140
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people look that way.</v>

127
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:19.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

128
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.031
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

129
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:20.780
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go eat lunch.</v>

130
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.620
<v Speaker 1>How much food can I eat and uh,</v>

131
00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:22.831
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

132
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:26.360
<v Speaker 1>and not gain weight or how much of that cake or that pie can eat or whatever.</v>

133
00:04:26.361 --> 00:04:27.840
<v Speaker 1>People I think tend to this is,</v>

134
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.311
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>

135
00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:29.660
<v Speaker 1>what can I get away with part of it?</v>

136
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

137
00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:33.050
<v Speaker 1>what if we shifted that around and you said,</v>

138
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.280
<v Speaker 1>what's the least amount of food I can eat and maintain muscle mass and maintain</v>

139
00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:42.281
<v Speaker 1>energy and and not get sick and most importantly not be hungry and you find if</v>

140
00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:45.230
<v Speaker 1>you do this experiment is pretty interesting.</v>

141
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.970
<v Speaker 1>If you become good at burning fat,</v>

142
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.290
<v Speaker 1>your your appetite,</v>

143
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 1>so self regulate and so mitigates that you find yourself pushing a plate of food</v>

144
00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:57.710
<v Speaker 1>away after a couple of bites or not being hungry or eating just the right amount</v>

145
00:04:57.711 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 1>of food to to to get you through the day and a couple other people out.</v>

146
