<v Speaker 1>and you're worried about what people </v>

120
00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.490
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that shit ain't good for you.</v>

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that.</v>

122
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

123
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you don't have a nice car.</v>

124
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were weird.</v>

125
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Shoes at zipped up on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a tesla.</v>

126
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ordered a fucking drive themselves.</v>

127
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I now know craziness.</v>

128
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I got the autopilot to Tom Papa about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

129
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm getting one.</v>

130
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm picking it up in March 31st.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

131
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>my buddy Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt Lichtenberg,</v>

132
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>he's got one and he said he gets on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highway.</v>

133
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.040
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

134
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.210
<v Speaker 1>you press a button twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it drives itself and he just </v>

135
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.210
<v Speaker 1>starts texting people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

136
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>not for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

137
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>That's just not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to the guy,</v>

138
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.630
<v Speaker 1>he explained it to me at the Tesla </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealership and I said I wouldn't use </v>

139
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.630
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

140
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will in the future.</v>

141
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Especially you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how much traffic here.</v>

142
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>

143
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 1>when you have a nice car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes driving a fun experience.</v>

144
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you have a look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with just having a</v>

145
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:52.130
<v Speaker 1>utilitarian car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

146
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Brock Lesnar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used to drive around in like,</v>

147
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>it was like a chevy citation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

148
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>It was like some weird little red </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking compact car that guy used to get</v>

149
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:06.220
<v Speaker 1>in that thing and he's what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of 300 pounds.</v>

150
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>He was a fucking every fucking thicker </v>
<v Speaker 1>than he makes.</v>

151
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.410
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes me like when I stand next to </v>

152
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.410
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're not the same species.</v>

153
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different kinds of humans</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen him.</v>

154
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this isn't for me.</v>

155
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm shaking people's hands before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like shack,</v>

156
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>shake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shack's hands check as these.</v>

157
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 1>But there's two guys like Shane Corwin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Lesner.</v>

158
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Both those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shake their hand,</v>

159
00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

160
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.850
<v Speaker 1>we're not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried getting hit with one of those </v>

161
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.280
<v Speaker 1>fucking beach on ours for me because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't grow up with any cars.</v>

162
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 1>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents were never in the cars.</v>

163
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.870
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't know the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes you got to know the </v>

164
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you grow up with it.</v>

165
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.920
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't grow up with it.</v>

166
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:53.921
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't grow up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever driven a fast </v>

167
00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:56.951
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drove a porsche once in traffic and I </v>

168
00:06:56.951 --> 00:06:56.951
<v Speaker 1>couldn't open it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't.</v>

169
00:06:56.951 --> 00:06:57.680
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't grow up.</v>

170
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 1>I grew up appreciating what the car was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tried to ask him to drive my car,</v>

171
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:02.890
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck no.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

183

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

185
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.860

<v Speaker 1>I don't think you need that though.</v>

191
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Chris alluded to this group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you need that though.</v>

192
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Two point eight seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero to 60 in two point eight seconds.</v>

193
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I don't need a four door sedan</v>

00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:55.271
<v Speaker 1>puts in Saint Dan to hit 60 and less </v>
<v Speaker 1>than three seconds end with no sound.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no rumble.</v>

196
00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:03.851
<v Speaker 1>There's no explosions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there are two things I wish I want </v>

197
00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>to start wearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's too late for me.</v>

00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 1>You just got to go to him.</v>

204
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:19.850

<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could say,</v>

205
00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:21.240
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom was killed by today.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

208
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.730
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking artist essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not essentially a hundred percent.</v>

209
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he looks at his art and he says,</v>

210
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:39.251
<v Speaker 1>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people commission me to do pieces and </v>

<v Speaker 1>So I'm just going to say I'm only going </v>

<v Speaker 1>That's how he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've that.</v>

215
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:47.790
<v Speaker 1>That's how he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>

216
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's no bigger artists </v>
<v Speaker 1>than in southern cal for tattoo artists.</v>

217
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.410
<v Speaker 1>It's the scene man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

218
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great spot.</v>

219

<v Speaker 3>If not the best in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is fucking killers here.</v>

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:04.300
<v Speaker 3>The shamrock yet cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet in Osi got some killers.</v>

221
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's on d all over the country </v>

222
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a resurgence in tattooing,</v>

223
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.161
<v Speaker 3>like tattooing over the last few decades</v>
<v Speaker 3>has become like a really respected art </v>

224
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 3>form instead of just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them were like Weirdo,</v>

225
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 3>fringe type artists who just were really</v>
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>

226
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:20.820
<v Speaker 3>But there's a stigma attached to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

227
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 3>there's always a stigma attached to </v>
<v Speaker 3>being tattooed up,</v>

228
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:28.550
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now it's not like if you have </v>

229
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.501
<v Speaker 3>tattoos like Aaron Dove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dove did this and this was like 50 </v>

230
00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:30.501
<v Speaker 3>hours of work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

231
00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 3>And he planned it all out as one sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did this one too.</v>

232
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 3>He just both really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's a friend too,</v>

233
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.940

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.860
<v Speaker 1>There used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You marry your daughter off.</v>

338
00:14:14.861 --> 00:14:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Daughters are so useless.</v>

340
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.000
<v Speaker 1>This guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Sweetie.</v>

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.350
<v Speaker 1>I tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not.</v>

342
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I cried my eyes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is about weddings.</v>

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Divorce.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But that's what they.</v>

346
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.400
<v Speaker 1>The reason why they used to give away a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dowery was because the woman was thought</v>

347
00:14:36.401 --> 00:14:38.590
<v Speaker 1>of as being less valuable than the man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

348
00:14:38.591 --> 00:14:43.591
<v Speaker 1>Because there's times are tough and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were dying in war and famine and </v>

349
00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:47.101
<v Speaker 1>fucking sword fights and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if you had daughters like the </v>

350
00:14:47.101 --> 00:14:50.851
<v Speaker 1>way you would marry them off to a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that you have to give them </v>

351
00:14:50.851 --> 00:14:53.971
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give the dude something to marry your </v>

352
00:14:53.971 --> 00:14:54.290
<v Speaker 1>daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'd get like,</v>

353
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 1>here's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a bag full of gold coins,</v>

354
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.470
<v Speaker 1>a ton of cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was the way that was like super</v>

355
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:02.170
<v Speaker 1>calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's bring this shit back.</v>

356
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:07.180
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't go the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was fascinating about </v>

357
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.170
<v Speaker 1>modern culture is the divorce is </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific for men.</v>

358
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Marriage and divorce can often be </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific for men financially and just </v>

359
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:19.020
<v Speaker 1>from the limited amount of exchanges </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had with friends that have been </v>

360
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 1>divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking horrific.</v>

361
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:24.370
<v Speaker 1>The amount of money they lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in California and the amount </v>

362
00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:24.370
<v Speaker 1>of money they have to give off because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

363
00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.520
<v Speaker 1>we know a few people that have done </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

364
00:15:25.521 --> 00:15:30.521
<v Speaker 1>It made good money and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't go well when it comes to the </v>

365
00:15:30.521 --> 00:15:33.170
<v Speaker 1>divorce and you find out the sums of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money they have to pay out when you have</v>

366
00:15:33.171 --> 00:15:36.350
<v Speaker 1>to maintain their lifestyle when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys were together.</v>

367
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a fighter.</v>

368
00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:42.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fighter friend who went through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorce and at the time when he was with</v>

369
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.980
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

370
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:46.880
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad ass making bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll the career's over,</v>

371
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough man.</v>

372
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.530
<v Speaker 1>It is tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy athletes especially.</v>

373
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:56.560
<v Speaker 1>But it's weird how it switched around </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it used to be that the man would </v>

374
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.400
<v Speaker 1>get a lot out of getting married to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

375
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.220
<v Speaker 1>so it'd be worth something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like a big thing,</v>

376
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.960
<v Speaker 1>like they had to give up a dowery and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now becomes the woman if she decides,</v>

377
00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:07.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of power in that.</v>

378
00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:09.980
<v Speaker 1>A few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you marry a rich guy,</v>

379
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you married some Donald Trump character.</v>

380
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Even if he's got a lock down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Prenup,</v>

381
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.640
<v Speaker 1>prenup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still set son.</v>

382
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Especially if have a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

383
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.950
<v Speaker 1>He'll give you a few minutes just to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck away from this.</v>

384
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.550
<v Speaker 1>If Donald Trump writes you a check for 2</v>
<v Speaker 1>million bucks,</v>

385
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 1>he makes that an a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

386
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:29.420
<v Speaker 1>That ain't no to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even a month.</v>

387
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it in a week when you've got a </v>

388
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:34.440
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$4,000,</v>

389
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.880
<v Speaker 1>million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

390
00:16:35.881 --> 00:16:36.590
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy.</v>

391
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he doesn't have that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

392
00:16:37.791 --> 00:16:41.090
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's worth 10,</v>

393
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.810
<v Speaker 1>but they say he's probably worth four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read estimates that he,</v>

394
00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:49.811
<v Speaker 1>if you actually look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take out the debt and everything </v>

395
00:16:49.811 --> 00:16:50.510
<v Speaker 1>and how much he puts into his business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you actually looked at what he has,</v>

396
00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:54.850
<v Speaker 1>moneywise is closer to 200 million broke</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass bitch fucking know.</v>

397
00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.310
<v Speaker 1>That can be 100 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can be hating on them though.</v>

398
00:16:57.311 --> 00:17:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Is that according to John Oliver and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some other stuff,</v>

399
00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:05.261
<v Speaker 1>I read haters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough thing to figure out,</v>

400
00:17:05.301 --> 00:17:08.860
<v Speaker 1>but you can apparently look at his </v>
<v Speaker 1>assets he's not releasing.</v>

401
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:13.861
<v Speaker 1>You can look at how much it costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can estimate what it would cost to </v>

402
00:17:13.861 --> 00:17:15.620
<v Speaker 1>run those based on employees and </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance and all that,</v>

403
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:20.830
<v Speaker 1>and then they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times I think a lot of </v>

404
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:20.830
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean certainly if they're public,</v>

405
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.240
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know private,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are statements,</v>

406
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.600
<v Speaker 1>there are tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are public tax for trump.</v>

407
00:17:26.601 --> 00:17:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Men Struggle is real and people can stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>only 200 mil.</v>

408
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

409
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think we don't know.</v>

410
00:17:34.551 --> 00:17:36.670
<v Speaker 1>So we probably should be throwing </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers rather rich's.</v>

411
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.290
<v Speaker 1>He's rich as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's hilarious man?</v>

412
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I watched a little bit of the Democrat </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrat debate.</v>

413
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I usually don't like bates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Bernie Sanders sent it home that he </v>

414
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 1>sent it home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton.</v>

415
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's some shit that she couldn't</v>

416
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:57.381
<v Speaker 3>say nothing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they were talking about the </v>

417
00:17:57.381 --> 00:17:57.381
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical industries and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>banking industry,</v>

418
00:17:57.381 --> 00:17:58.320
<v Speaker 3>the banking industry in particular he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was talking about,</v>

419
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.880
<v Speaker 3>that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about the speeches that </v>

420
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.200
<v Speaker 3>she gives for hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars and then you know,</v>

421
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.320
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about how many of you like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

422
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:12.321
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't we get the transcripts from </v>

423
00:18:12.321 --> 00:18:13.200
<v Speaker 3>these speeches?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What an amazing speech it must have been</v>

424
00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:16.770
<v Speaker 3>to be worth $250,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the fuck it was.</v>

425
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 3>And Hillary was nervous as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She threw a cough drop in her mouth.</v>

426
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.240
<v Speaker 3>She's sweating and like half fake </v>
<v Speaker 3>smiling.</v>

427
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.010
<v Speaker 3>She can't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

428
00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:31.011
<v Speaker 3>you could read the transcripts of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the times I've performed and did </v>

429
00:18:31.011 --> 00:18:34.440
<v Speaker 3>speeches in front of the banking </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry because there are none.</v>

430
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.470
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a guy who took his.</v>

431
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.690
<v Speaker 3>He took his vacation with his wife and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Soviet Union.</v>

432
00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an interesting guy.</v>

433
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.040
<v Speaker 3>He's a very interesting site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted out last night,</v>

434
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 3>it's called [inaudible] dot com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

435
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:52.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm not too into politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We go this and they have like all the </v>

436
00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.701
<v Speaker 3>major issues can click multiple choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What what you think is major and goes </v>

437
00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:59.190
<v Speaker 3>through all of them and that then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>says who you most likely should vote for</v>

438
00:18:59.191 --> 00:19:00.690
<v Speaker 3>it because your percentage is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>dope.</v>

439
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see my.</v>

440
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:05.220
<v Speaker 3>My feeling about Hillary is she seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>like business as usual.</v>

441
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether she would be good or not.</v>

442
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.680
<v Speaker 3>She's 100 percent businesses usually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that is the last shit this </v>

443
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.610
<v Speaker 3>country needs right now is this same </v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

444
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.820
<v Speaker 3>so he tried to bring in trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would bring in Bernie or trump for </v>

445
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:20.220
<v Speaker 3>bringing hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although Bernie,</v>

446
00:19:20.221 --> 00:19:25.221
<v Speaker 3>I'd bring in Bernie because I think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would shake shit up culturally,</v>

447
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.480
<v Speaker 3>but it's the best thing though.</v>

448
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing.</v>

449
00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:29.790
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't do that.</v>

450
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.580
<v Speaker 3>He can't really pass all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need congress and stuff.</v>

451
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.530
<v Speaker 3>The idea of what he's trying to tax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's socialism.</v>

452
00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.470
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of crazy.</v>

453
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.100
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

454
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.310
<v Speaker 3>It defies human nature because human </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>

455
00:19:44.311 --> 00:19:47.940
<v Speaker 3>when you give people a way to not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to work for things they do and some.</v>

456
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.220
<v Speaker 3>There's some people that fall upon hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

457
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.500
<v Speaker 3>There's some people that they got a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>break,</v>

458
00:19:52.501 --> 00:19:54.930
<v Speaker 3>a bum steer in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of people that are doing</v>

459
00:19:54.931 --> 00:19:59.931
<v Speaker 3>poorly that it's not their fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also a bunch of people that </v>

460
00:19:59.931 --> 00:20:00.600
<v Speaker 3>are just fucking lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably the majority,</v>

461
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:02.820
<v Speaker 3>once you say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the numbers are.</v>

462
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:06.550
<v Speaker 3>I've never examined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Penalize people that produce yes,</v>

463
00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 3>and you don't want to tax people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>produce who also create wealth,</v>

464
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:15.470
<v Speaker 3>but you don't want to tax them 75 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent the way France under Orland is </v>

465
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.650
<v Speaker 3>trying to do and has done.</v>

466
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.190
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't work out because people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that produce will stop producing.</v>

467
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:23.670
<v Speaker 3>If I have to work 75 percent of my day </v>
<v Speaker 3>for someone else for the greater good,</v>

468
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.100
<v Speaker 3>hell no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've seen how that works in.</v>

469
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.370
<v Speaker 3>Just pick up a history book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work that well.</v>

470
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.280
<v Speaker 3>How will we as Bernie his oldest fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>his ass ain't gonna make it.</v>

471
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:37.490
<v Speaker 3>Last question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should always be rather than Bernie or </v>

472
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.090
<v Speaker 3>just to ask yourself to what percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what percentage are you willing to give </v>

473
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.720
<v Speaker 3>your power and your money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is it 50 percent duties?</v>

474
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.760
<v Speaker 3>It unfortunately for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no fucking investment this site </v>

475
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 3>and literally breaks it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of stuff I didn't know about.</v>

476
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:57.481
<v Speaker 3>It breaks down very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just multiple choice and it shows </v>

477
00:20:57.481 --> 00:21:00.810
<v Speaker 3>bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is who believes in the way you do </v>

478
00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:00.810
<v Speaker 3>and this is who you should believes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you do.</v>

479
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:06.630
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one I would never think Hillary </v>

480
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.630
<v Speaker 3>Clinton see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing,</v>

481
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.040
<v Speaker 3>she's a centrist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't tell what she really believes in.</v>

482
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:13.150
<v Speaker 3>That's right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was what she said about Nancy Reagan</v>

483
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:18.250
<v Speaker 3>and Ronald Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A fucking liberals are abandoning her </v>

484
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.880
<v Speaker 3>now because she was trying to say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan opened up</v>

485
00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 3>the conversation about aids during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties.</v>

486
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:27.460
<v Speaker 3>That is total bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only is it total bullshit,</v>

487
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.740
<v Speaker 3>silence is death is like a campaign </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they weren't talking about it.</v>

488
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.040
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't talk about aids for </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking years.</v>

489
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember it very well and that wasn't </v>

490
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:40.150
<v Speaker 3>a good administration just because Nancy</v>
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>

491
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she died and I,</v>

492
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.640
<v Speaker 3>I bet she was a nice lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

493
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.330
<v Speaker 3>she was really into astrology and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>married to a president.</v>

494
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're done here.</v>

495
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:53.040
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to lie about them opening</v>
<v Speaker 3>up some sort of a fucking dialogue with </v>

496
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.760
<v Speaker 3>this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but eight,</v>

497
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:54.940
<v Speaker 3>that's just not what they did.</v>

498
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.300
<v Speaker 3>Hillary's biggest liability is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't trust her.</v>

499
00:21:58.301 --> 00:22:00.430
<v Speaker 3>She's just not based on her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Based on her history.</v>

500
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.970
<v Speaker 3>That was another thing in the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said 37 percent.</v>

501
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was.</v>

502
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:10.200
<v Speaker 3>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Truster only 37 percent trusted women in</v>

503
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:15.310
<v Speaker 3>your country and there's no women trust </v>
<v Speaker 3>or less and so crazy.</v>

504
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it needs a stylist.</v>

505
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the fucker.</v>

506
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.730
<v Speaker 3>Here's the biggest thing I have them do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she is more like Obama,</v>

507
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:27.090
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the past six years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the economy right now is not doing </v>

508
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:31.260
<v Speaker 3>terribly and this is a guy who believes </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably I'm a little bit more to the </v>

509
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.010
<v Speaker 3>right at least fiscally than someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Obama,</v>

510
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.160
<v Speaker 3>but I have to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

511
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:36.620
<v Speaker 3>I was preaching about how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

512
00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.410
<v Speaker 3>under Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at his policies,</v>

513
00:22:38.411 --> 00:22:42.010
<v Speaker 3>the government is going to grow the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government because of a lot of factors.</v>

514
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not just Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at a lot of measures for</v>

515
00:22:45.521 --> 00:22:50.521
<v Speaker 3>how government is grown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of stayed exactly flat in the </v>

516
00:22:50.521 --> 00:22:50.521
<v Speaker 3>past six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't grown.</v>

517
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:55.730
<v Speaker 3>A lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's because we don't have as big a </v>

518
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:56.980
<v Speaker 3>tax base and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are a lot of factors that go </v>

519
00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:56.980
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what,</v>

520
00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:02.130
<v Speaker 3>in six years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like the economist disaster in </v>

521
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.580
<v Speaker 3>by a lot of measures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The economy's doing really well.</v>

522
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.910
<v Speaker 3>So that's hard for conservatives to </v>
<v Speaker 3>argue with you.</v>

523
00:23:06.911 --> 00:23:07.990
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me just.</v>

524
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.050
<v Speaker 3>What's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blind allegiance.</v>

525
00:23:11.051 --> 00:23:14.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but devil's advocate.</v>

526
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.910
<v Speaker 3>Blind allegiance popped into my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

527
00:23:15.911 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 3>why is that word?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

528
00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:22.290
<v Speaker 3>awesome word though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at it from a Republican </v>

529
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.380
<v Speaker 3>point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing that can be easily argued,</v>

530
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:28.381
<v Speaker 3>this is a common cycle of recession and </v>
<v Speaker 3>financial gain.</v>

531
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:29.580
<v Speaker 3>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

532
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.800
<v Speaker 3>And this is exactly what happens after a</v>
<v Speaker 3>downfall.</v>

533
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.240
<v Speaker 3>The downfall of our economy in 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know shit about finance,</v>

534
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:42.241
<v Speaker 3>but I've read a bunch of stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people do know shit about and these </v>

535
00:23:42.241 --> 00:23:43.600
<v Speaker 3>cycles are reoccurring cycles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's always,</v>

536
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:47.390
<v Speaker 3>as long as the republic stays up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still up and running.</v>

537
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.270
<v Speaker 3>So he goes down and crashes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People readjust.</v>

538
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Some people find their way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people lose their way.</v>

539
00:23:52.761 --> 00:23:55.460
<v Speaker 3>Some people jump off buildings and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>it builds back again.</v>

540
00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.700
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's one of the things that they </v>

541
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:00.700
<v Speaker 3>argued about Clinton's era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were saying,</v>

542
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:05.411
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could say that Bill Clinton was </v>

543
00:24:05.411 --> 00:24:05.411
<v Speaker 3>responsible for all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

544
00:24:05.411 --> 00:24:10.300
<v Speaker 3>all the signs seem to indicate that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cycle is moving in that direction </v>

545
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.291
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No matter who is the president doesn't </v>

546
00:24:14.291 --> 00:24:15.350
<v Speaker 3>have gone out of my ass for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know it exactly.</v>

547
00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.890
<v Speaker 3>But if trump wins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if trump wins,</v>

548
00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:20.930
<v Speaker 3>is there going to be chaos?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chaos.</v>

549
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:25.931
<v Speaker 3>People are people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black people are already freaking the </v>

550
00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:27.640
<v Speaker 3>fuck out that he fights at his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>bore,</v>

551
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.860
<v Speaker 3>rushing the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The numbers don't add up for trump.</v>

552
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.500
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have the minorities.</v>

553
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.950
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

554
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.430
<v Speaker 3>you'll see I've known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look,</v>

555
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.760
<v Speaker 3>you can't take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all comes down to him.</v>

556
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get the nomination.</v>

557
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:47.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But all I'm saying is you don't really </v>

558
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.850
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem is it's real possible.</v>

559
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.580
<v Speaker 3>It's really just the idea that we've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>this far.</v>

560
00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.500
<v Speaker 3>It's insane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>

561
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.590
<v Speaker 3>A lot of Republicans would tell you that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Republicans,</v>

562
00:24:57.591 --> 00:24:59.690
<v Speaker 3>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're not unified,</v>

563
00:24:59.691 --> 00:25:04.691
<v Speaker 3>have committed political suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pundits that I've listened to will </v>

564
00:25:04.691 --> 00:25:06.440
<v Speaker 3>basically look at these hard numbers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

565
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that you see supporting </v>

566
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:11.860
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

567
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:11.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump has one,</v>

568
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:11.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

569
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.120
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

570
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.340
<v Speaker 3>the popular vote isn't there for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the day.</v>

571
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.900
<v Speaker 3>It's going to go to Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll see someone.</v>

572
00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:20.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

573
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:21.980
<v Speaker 3>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

574
00:25:21.981 --> 00:25:22.880
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will see.</v>

575
00:25:22.881 --> 00:25:24.350
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem.</v>

576
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.680
<v Speaker 3>He hasn't even started to attack her yet</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's going to attack from Ben Gazi.</v>

577
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.820
<v Speaker 3>She could be indicted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing,</v>

578
00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.740
<v Speaker 3>two different cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

579
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:37.250
<v Speaker 3>She's indicted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big issue when we do,</v>

580
00:25:37.251 --> 00:25:42.251
<v Speaker 3>you know about the guy who was the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the computer analysts that put together </v>

581
00:25:42.251 --> 00:25:43.850
<v Speaker 3>her email server.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking got immunity.</v>

582
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:47.640
<v Speaker 3>He just said he just got immunity </v>
<v Speaker 3>against prosecution apparently so.</v>

583
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.990
<v Speaker 3>So he can know so little about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't be.</v>

584
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:56.680
<v Speaker 3>So then he's going to squeal like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little piggy squeals like a little </v>

585
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:56.680
<v Speaker 3>piggy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got real problems.</v>

586
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.490
<v Speaker 3>But the idea of giving him immunity with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real.</v>

587
00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:03.610
<v Speaker 3>I know I read that somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make sure that I just give him like 300 </v>

588
00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:03.610
<v Speaker 3>middle to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She can't.</v>

589
00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.570
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't have that kind of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She makes good money,</v>

590
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:07.740
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure she spends it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lack of motherfucker.</v>

591
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.760
<v Speaker 3>The payouts per year from every lane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get insane amounts of money.</v>

592
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.350
<v Speaker 3>Really just her in trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

593
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.760
<v Speaker 3>insert her speaking monies off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>charts.</v>

594
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.260
<v Speaker 3>What does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it say?</v>

595
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.080
<v Speaker 3>Scroll down please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Justice Department grants.</v>

596
00:26:21.081 --> 00:26:23.270
<v Speaker 3>Immunity to staff who set up Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 3>email server.</v>

597
00:26:23.271 --> 00:26:24.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's true.</v>

598
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.610
<v Speaker 3>So what that means is if they did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means that they're thinking about a</v>

599
00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:33.050
<v Speaker 3>case and they're probably planning case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if this guy gave up immunity,</v>

600
00:26:33.051 --> 00:26:36.470
<v Speaker 3>that means he's got some serious fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>information to get a bigger fish.</v>

601
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Who's the bigger fish?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton that she don't like.</v>

602
00:26:40.461 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy because the choices so </v>
<v Speaker 3>poor,</v>

603
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.350
<v Speaker 4>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

604
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.070
<v Speaker 4>because are the smart people of American</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

605
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.110
<v Speaker 4>fuck that job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mind Bernie Sanders.</v>

606
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:54.111
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would almost be willing to give up </v>

607
00:26:54.111 --> 00:26:54.111
<v Speaker 4>more money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's too old.</v>

608
00:26:54.111 --> 00:26:58.370
<v Speaker 4>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the problem that I have with the </v>

609
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.680
<v Speaker 4>given up more money though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you're giving up more money to </v>

610
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:00.680
<v Speaker 4>the government and I don't trust the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

611
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.000
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I could give up money or if.</v>

612
00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.450
<v Speaker 4>If you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing.</v>

613
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:08.540
<v Speaker 4>If you could have mandated charity for </v>
<v Speaker 4>really wealthy people where you could </v>

614
00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.660
<v Speaker 4>give to like I like to give to something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Justin wren is we're going to fight</v>

615
00:27:12.661 --> 00:27:14.340
<v Speaker 4>for the forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a no brainer.</v>

616
00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 4>I give to that one because I know </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly where the money's going.</v>

617
00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:17.600
<v Speaker 4>That's a beautiful one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

618
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.700
<v Speaker 4>But if you could get like a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>good ones,</v>

619
00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a good.</v>

620
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:23.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know I probably.</v>

621
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:29.780
<v Speaker 4>The problem is so much of that money </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes to running the machine that's </v>

622
00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.500
<v Speaker 4>supposed to dole out the crew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including Red Cross.</v>

623
00:27:31.501 --> 00:27:35.100
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look online,</v>

624
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:40.130
<v Speaker 4>there's a few websites that detail what </v>
<v Speaker 4>percentage of your dollar actually goes </v>

625
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:43.350
<v Speaker 4>to the charity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really listen at one point,</v>

626
00:27:43.351 --> 00:27:44.520
<v Speaker 4>at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the united way,</v>

627
00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:47.190
<v Speaker 4>at one point I remember they had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>special on it.</v>

628
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.790
<v Speaker 4>One cent of every dollar was actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to the charity.</v>

629
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.510
<v Speaker 4>The ninety nine cents was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>running the actual company.</v>

630
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.240
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but high salaries.</v>

631
00:27:56.241 --> 00:28:01.241
<v Speaker 4>Ceos like the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It becomes a quick wounded warrior </v>

632
00:28:01.241 --> 00:28:01.770
<v Speaker 4>project.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you see that?</v>

633
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.800
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I was just rocking the hat the </v>

634
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.400
<v Speaker 4>other day was a huge controversy because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they handled the two guys running it.</v>

635
00:28:08.401 --> 00:28:11.370
<v Speaker 4>We're making a million dollars a year </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were spending on lavish,</v>

636
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.610
<v Speaker 4>lavish conferences and stuff.</v>

637
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:15.720
<v Speaker 4>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

638
00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.070
<v Speaker 4>It will make it a million dollars a </v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

639
00:28:17.071 --> 00:28:22.071
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Both of them and now they're what you </v>

640
00:28:22.071 --> 00:28:23.961
<v Speaker 4>want to talk about the wrong people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck over like that trained killers,</v>

641
00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:27.760
<v Speaker 4>but to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come back from serving their country and</v>

642
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:32.190
<v Speaker 4>find out about this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to be fair to those guys,</v>

643
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.890
<v Speaker 4>but to be fair to the people running the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wounded warrior project,</v>

644
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.060
<v Speaker 4>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're working for a very big company</v>

645
00:28:39.061 --> 00:28:42.530
<v Speaker 4>and you make.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they made over $300,</v>

646
00:28:42.531 --> 00:28:44.850
<v Speaker 4>million dollars in donations in one </v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

647
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:49.080
<v Speaker 4>They had a huge endowment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's when you're working all day,</v>

648
00:28:49.081 --> 00:28:52.560
<v Speaker 4>and I'm sure these guys are good people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are working probably 12 hours a day.</v>

649
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.010
<v Speaker 4>You're going to put a first class ticket</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it might be a red.</v>

650
00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.050
<v Speaker 4>I got to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

651
00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing all this work.</v>

652
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:03.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to spend $500 as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>$300 and it just adds up.</v>

653
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:08.030
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is if you're doing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of work and you're really good at </v>

654
00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:08.030
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might say,</v>

655
00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:08.030
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're worth it.</v>

656
00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.840
<v Speaker 4>We're going to give you a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars because the board votes that in.</v>

657
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.570
<v Speaker 4>So what I'm saying is that when you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

658
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.270
<v Speaker 4>when you have that much money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before you give them a free pass,</v>

659
00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:16.680
<v Speaker 4>we should probably know how they got to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

660
00:29:16.681 --> 00:29:21.681
<v Speaker 4>Number three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is anytime you have a </v>

661
00:29:21.681 --> 00:29:22.320
<v Speaker 4>lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be spent and people,</v>

662
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.440
<v Speaker 4>and there's not enough accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Human beings are going to behave in a </v>

663
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:27.440
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

664
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.020
<v Speaker 4>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

665
00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.270
<v Speaker 4>it's anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're getting more money.</v>

666
00:29:30.271 --> 00:29:34.000
<v Speaker 4>We're all doing the good job here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We deserve something.</v>

667
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:37.980
<v Speaker 4>The biggest illusion is that people with</v>
<v Speaker 4>money are happier.</v>

668
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:41.590
<v Speaker 4>It might be the biggest illusion that </v>
<v Speaker 4>exists in the world today</v>

669
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:44.530
<v Speaker 3>because everybody really wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy,</v>

670
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:49.770
<v Speaker 3>but we really want to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get happy and the one thing that we </v>

671
00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:50.350
<v Speaker 3>can't figure out how to do is pay the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bills.</v>

672
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:51.670
<v Speaker 3>So we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

673
00:29:51.671 --> 00:29:53.680
<v Speaker 3>if I could just pay my bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be happy.</v>

674
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Like that is like one of the prevailing </v>
<v Speaker 3>illusions.</v>

675
00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a certain point where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>make enough money where the bills are </v>

676
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.190
<v Speaker 3>taken care of and that which you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be happy not stressed out about</v>

677
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 3>how long the answer to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

678
00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:11.701
<v Speaker 3>It's not the answer to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It certainly makes you happier to not </v>

679
00:30:11.701 --> 00:30:15.121
<v Speaker 3>have to pay your bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how many people do we know that are </v>

680
00:30:15.121 --> 00:30:17.791
<v Speaker 3>like super successful?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Multimillionaires out of their fucking </v>

681
00:30:17.791 --> 00:30:18.160
<v Speaker 3>mind?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Miserable.</v>

682
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.020
<v Speaker 3>The rich people I know are the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>miserable.</v>

683
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:26.040
<v Speaker 3>When I think I did a little inventory on</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Times that I think about what </v>

684
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.120
<v Speaker 3>that brings a smile on my face at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Times that I remember being the happiest</v>

685
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:28.750
<v Speaker 3>gay stuff.</v>

686
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 3>Almost always when I'm in a behind a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dumpster with a strong guy,</v>

687
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:34.540
<v Speaker 3>very dark with the capital area guys are</v>
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>

688
00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>

689
00:30:36.821 --> 00:30:38.730
<v Speaker 3>and very tall.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

789
00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.320
<v Speaker 1>That's how I remembered it before I saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

<v Speaker 1>John Oliver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dynamo is a serious fucking Jujitsu </v>

792
00:34:39.671 --> 00:34:40.340
<v Speaker 1>phenom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason it didn't really</v>

793
00:34:40.341 --> 00:34:45.341
<v Speaker 1>pan out in MMA is fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was also a lot older by the time </v>

794
00:34:45.341 --> 00:34:47.040
<v Speaker 1>he got the click on John Oliver Dynamos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

795
00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:48.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

796
00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:53.140
<v Speaker 1>right about the time they were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>testing for real last to Mike Russell.</v>

797
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Last uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave Herman that beat James Thompson.</v>

800
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:05.050

<v Speaker 1>2003 in Brazil.</v>

801
00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:07.190

<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>one color tattoo and I always wondered </v>

855
00:37:27.831 --> 00:37:28.020
<v Speaker 1>if that's a cover up.</v>

856
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Like they maybe had some shitty tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always knew it as a cover up.</v>

857
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Like it was a real bad tattoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe a girl or something.</v>

858
00:37:35.041 --> 00:37:37.200
<v Speaker 1>So then they just blacked it all out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't cover it up.</v>

859
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:40.170

00:41:32.711 --> 00:41:34.310
<v Speaker 1>He knows a million people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear it.</v>

954
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.740

<v Speaker 1>I never think of that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But for some people that's a big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These also did a lot of stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a lot of stuff.</v>

958
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Had a lot of head trauma with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious demons with fighters,</v>

959
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:52.640
<v Speaker 1>some fighters that there is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>adderall,</v>

<v Speaker 1>for a long time,</v>

961
00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:57.830
<v Speaker 1>but that's from head trauma.</v>

962
00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what it feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got erratic behavior.</v>

963
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Breathing is a little bit erratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

964
00:42:03.081 --> 00:42:05.660
<v Speaker 1>so they don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't keep it together very long,</v>

965
00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:07.670
<v Speaker 1>but they can't keep it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If something's boring,</v>

966
00:42:07.671 --> 00:42:09.300
<v Speaker 1>they can't keep it together as something</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

967
00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:14.940
<v Speaker 1>If something gets annoying to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a good way of like </v>

968
00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.050
<v Speaker 1>staying calm a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them too.</v>

969
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:18.920
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of them,</v>

970
00:42:18.921 --> 00:42:22.610
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of them on our podcast or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

971
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:25.640
<v Speaker 1>personal conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jump all over the board,</v>

972
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:29.480
<v Speaker 1>like they will never finish a story and </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back around to jump all over.</v>

973
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know war machine,</v>

974
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.400
<v Speaker 1>he watched his dad die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

975
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was super dark demons.</v>

976
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Some tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got arrested when he was really </v>

977
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:45.251
<v Speaker 1>fucking young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cops beat the fuck out of him when he </v>

978
00:42:45.251 --> 00:42:45.251
<v Speaker 1>was like a teenager for nothing.</v>

979
00:42:45.251 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 1>He tells a story and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

980
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:48.670
<v Speaker 1>I tend to believe him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

981
00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I tend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that he's definitely made some </v>

982
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:54.240
<v Speaker 1>fucking horrible choices in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

983
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 1>But I also think he got fucked life </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked him.</v>

984
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.350
<v Speaker 1>He got a rough life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked him early enough cards,</v>

985
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:05.950
<v Speaker 1>fucked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was around a bunch of other </v>

986
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.471
<v Speaker 1>people that also got fucked and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>real hard to discern how to what </v>

987
00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 1>direction to go through in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

988
00:43:11.601 --> 00:43:16.601
<v Speaker 1>there's been a gang of people like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have gone in and out through the UFC </v>

989
00:43:16.601 --> 00:43:16.601
<v Speaker 1>that just did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

990
00:43:16.601 --> 00:43:21.400
<v Speaker 1>They've been surrounded with shitheads </v>
<v Speaker 1>and psychos and fucking criminals their </v>

991
00:43:21.651 --> 00:43:23.750
<v Speaker 1>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know peace in normal,</v>

992
00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:28.760
<v Speaker 1>so that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still can't try and kill a bitch </v>

993
00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:29.060
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what he did was horrific,</v>

994
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.360
<v Speaker 1>horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that's also a breakdown of an </v>

995
00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:34.360
<v Speaker 1>ability to cope at all.</v>

996
00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.590
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like he had bouts of madness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

997
00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came home.</v>

998
00:43:37.611 --> 00:43:40.160
<v Speaker 1>He came over to her house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't supposed to be there.</v>

999
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:42.440
<v Speaker 1>They were separated though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't supposed to be there.</v>

1000
00:43:42.441 --> 00:43:44.070
<v Speaker 1>He came over to her house and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a guy.</v>

1001
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.550

1007
00:43:57.771 --> 00:43:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he would've been running.</v>

1008
00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I would have been bad situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a knife then I'm like,</v>

1009
00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.780

1010
00:44:04.781 --> 00:44:08.120
<v Speaker 1>He's well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he apparently it was a total surprise.</v>

1011
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:11.410
<v Speaker 1>He didn't expect the guy to beat and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>just saw red and freaked the fuck out.</v>

1012
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.720
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking crazy.</v>

1013
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.070
<v Speaker 1>He's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always been nuts,</v>

1014
00:44:16.071 --> 00:44:21.071
<v Speaker 1>but he's always been like super cool and</v>
<v Speaker 1>super friendly to me and I mean I was,</v>

1015
00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:26.980
<v Speaker 1>I knew he had gotten into crazy fights </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a bunch of porn stars and beat the </v>

1016
00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.440

<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1017
00:44:27.441 --> 00:44:29.240
<v Speaker 1>like three or four people at some porn </v>
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>

1018
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Some dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to its off,</v>

1019
00:44:31.741 --> 00:44:33.990
<v Speaker 1>they see the wrong shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fuck up.</v>

1020
00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no repercussions.</v>

1021
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:38.170
<v Speaker 1>They can come across a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to fuck your world up anyway.</v>

1022
00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.910
<v Speaker 1>We can be my friend though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1023
00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:43.580
<v Speaker 1>he can't get anybody but he can't be my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>

1024
00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:47.650
<v Speaker 1>He can't be anybody who's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about it.</v>

1025
00:44:47.651 --> 00:44:52.050
<v Speaker 1>But he can't be anybody's friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in jail forever,</v>

1026
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:57.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's gonna make friends in there </v>

1027
00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:57.080
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point being like there's,</v>

1028
00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:00.450
<v Speaker 1>there's certain guys that will just </v>
<v Speaker 1>always fuck up.</v>

1029
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:02.340
<v Speaker 1>It seems well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also,</v>

1030
00:45:02.341 --> 00:45:03.630
<v Speaker 1>it's self sabotage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1031
00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Like this shitty hand of cards in life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they play this victim game.</v>

1032
00:45:07.711 --> 00:45:11.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't deserve any success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they look kind of.</v>

1033
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Dave and I were talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called Joe because I wanted to lend </v>

1034
00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.590
<v Speaker 1>somebody money and I just want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes like I,</v>

1035
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I think I have a lot of guilt because </v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you think about how some people </v>

1036
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.420
<v Speaker 1>grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just never even had a chance.</v>

1037
00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:27.210
<v Speaker 1>It was just a math fell in my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't fall in there.</v>

1038
00:45:27.211 --> 00:45:29.310
<v Speaker 1>I had parents that loved me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had stability.</v>

1039
00:45:29.311 --> 00:45:34.311
<v Speaker 1>Some people had the exact opposite and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we were talking to like guy I </v>

1040
00:45:34.311 --> 00:45:35.970
<v Speaker 1>wanted to help and it's just a disaster </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

1041
00:45:35.971 --> 00:45:37.380
<v Speaker 1>I want to give him money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to help them,</v>

1042
00:45:37.381 --> 00:45:40.530
<v Speaker 1>but you get a sense that this guy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

1043
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.790
<v Speaker 1>He's always going to be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brands going to be broke.</v>

1044
00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:45.510
<v Speaker 1>He's always going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1045
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I've loaned people money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1046
00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.720
<v Speaker 1>You know how many people pay me back on </v>
<v Speaker 1>to zero?</v>

1047
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.410
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you tell me this?</v>

1048
00:45:52.411 --> 00:45:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Did you tell me this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been lending people money.</v>

1049
00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:56.300
<v Speaker 1>If you lend someone money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it.</v>

1050
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Don't expect to just give it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell them,</v>

1051
00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.150
<v Speaker 1>my father said that I've given it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1052
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gave me that advice.</v>

1053
00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.770
<v Speaker 1>I've got good friends that had been in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial crunch and I gave him money.</v>

1054
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.490
<v Speaker 1>If it's a legit friend and I know it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's a family member,</v>

1055
00:46:08.491 --> 00:46:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I know it's going to help them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking tape.</v>

1056
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:12.590
<v Speaker 1>I was too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fired for a reason,</v>

1057
00:46:12.591 --> 00:46:15.540
<v Speaker 1>so just take it takes time to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that out though.</v>

1058
00:46:15.541 --> 00:46:20.541
<v Speaker 1>Like when I didn't have any money most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my life and then all sudden when I </v>

1059
00:46:20.541 --> 00:46:21.030
<v Speaker 1>started having money and someone needed </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

1060
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I looked at them as like how I used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

1061
00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:23.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1062
00:46:23.641 --> 00:46:25.050
<v Speaker 1>if I help this guy out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>

1063
00:46:25.051 --> 00:46:26.790
<v Speaker 1>he'll get back on his feet and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of it,</v>

1064
00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.140
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of them did.</v>

1065
00:46:28.141 --> 00:46:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start avoiding you.</v>

1066
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is really weird.</v>

1067
00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Hey Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1068
00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:38.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were supposed to pay me after three </v>

1069
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:38.630
<v Speaker 1>months and it's now six months present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1070
00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:43.830
<v Speaker 1>it's the old saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were the fastest way to lose a </v>

1071
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:43.830
<v Speaker 1>friend is lending money because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:46.440
<v Speaker 1>I've kind of gotten what was owed me </v>
<v Speaker 1>money for so long that I just don't even</v>

1073
00:46:46.441 --> 00:46:49.090
<v Speaker 1>bring it up anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll call me up and he'll like,</v>

1074
00:46:49.091 --> 00:46:52.410
<v Speaker 1>it felt good and every time we talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll give me the same song and dance.</v>

1075
00:46:52.411 --> 00:46:57.411
<v Speaker 1>But he's about to pay me back and duties</v>
<v Speaker 1>owed me money for years when he's not </v>

1076
00:46:57.411 --> 00:47:01.060
<v Speaker 1>really acquaintances now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

1077
00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:01.890
<v Speaker 1>that sealed it.</v>

1078
00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:02.760
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1079
00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1080
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.230
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times my experience with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that yes,</v>

1081
00:47:07.231 --> 00:47:11.280
<v Speaker 1>some people say there are plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories of people who needed money badly</v>

1082
00:47:11.281 --> 00:47:13.110
<v Speaker 1>and they made good and they paid it </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1083
00:47:13.111 --> 00:47:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1084
00:47:13.801 --> 00:47:15.660
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>

1085
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:17.930
<v Speaker 1>the people that I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you just know,</v>

1086
00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:18.690
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1087
00:47:18.691 --> 00:47:20.610
<v Speaker 1>you're always from one crisis to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

1088
00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you doing it?</v>

1089
00:47:22.171 --> 00:47:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I my last fight,</v>

1090
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:30.050
<v Speaker 1>I signed this deal with this company and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call them out close friend </v>

1091
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:32.300
<v Speaker 1>who did the deal and never saw the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a real.</v>

1092
00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I've known this guy for average super </v>
<v Speaker 1>close friend man and not a financially </v>

1093
00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing better than I've ever done.</v>

1094
00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1095
00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:44.600
<v Speaker 1>we always had this rift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't texting me or calling me back </v>

1096
00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:45.250
<v Speaker 1>and I just called him one day from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>random number and I said,</v>

1097
00:47:45.251 --> 00:47:46.240
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's me.</v>

1098
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Fuck the money man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your friendship means more than me.</v>

1099
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if I ever get that money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just move on man.</v>

1100
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:53.590
<v Speaker 1>We're good now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>

1101
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.530
<v Speaker 1>But he's always going to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem knowing that he ripped you off.</v>

1102
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:58.630
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm cool with that.</v>

1103
00:47:58.690 --> 00:47:59.890
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's probably,</v>

1104
00:47:59.891 --> 00:48:03.770
<v Speaker 1>it's probably makes him feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least I know where we're good and</v>

1105
00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:04.960
<v Speaker 1>we have open relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1106
00:48:04.961 --> 00:48:06.280
<v Speaker 1>that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very nice of,</v>

1107
00:48:06.281 --> 00:48:07.170
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1108
00:48:07.171 --> 00:48:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told this dude,</v>

1109
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean like six months in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was annoyed that I didn't get paid </v>

1110
00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:14.080
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I stopped,</v>

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:14.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm this,</v>

1112
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:18.010

<v Speaker 1>I mean I could go back over to the Times</v>

1113
00:48:18.011 --> 00:48:23.011
<v Speaker 1>that I've been here and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is everybody's got this </v>

1114
00:48:23.011 --> 00:48:23.011
<v Speaker 1>scam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got this scheme,</v>

1115
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:24.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to come to you and if you just</v>

<v Speaker 1>gave me this money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start this business and </v>

1117
00:48:29.761 --> 00:48:29.761
<v Speaker 1>that business can make so much money.</v>

1118
00:48:29.761 --> 00:48:33.720
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as my buddy gets in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna bring his cousin who has a </v>

1119

<v Speaker 1>connection and we're going to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know that because how many people lent</v>

1121

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1199
00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:36.290
<v Speaker 1>like exactly like most things in under </v>
<v Speaker 1>most situations.</v>

1200
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.800
<v Speaker 1>When people need money or they come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to borrow money,</v>

1201
00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.870
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to fucking make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1202
00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:42.940
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1203
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:46.040
<v Speaker 1>If they're reaching out to you from God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of those guys,</v>

1204
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.750
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for a shortcut.</v>

1205
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of this,</v>

1206
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:53.870
<v Speaker 1>this part of the personality of someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who keeps coming to people asking for </v>

1207
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:56.921
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's so common that it's the </v>

1208
00:51:56.921 --> 00:51:59.951
<v Speaker 1>same kind of guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this God that has this </v>

1209
00:51:59.951 --> 00:52:03.131
<v Speaker 1>elaborate story that he tells you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>involves some new thing that's going to </v>

1210
00:52:03.131 --> 00:52:04.640
<v Speaker 1>happen and when that new thing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take.</v>

1375
00:58:23.591 --> 00:58:27.670
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means about that $5,000.</v>

1376
00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more happy now.</v>

1377
00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get more satisfaction when there's </v>

1378
00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:35.370
<v Speaker 1>those live crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I put them on instagram.</v>

1379
00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:39.030
<v Speaker 1>So I'm so happy because it's hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain because in the UFC if,</v>

1380
00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:40.120
<v Speaker 1>if you have a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1381
00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.370
<v Speaker 1>And I've never been the main event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been combing events,</v>

1382
00:58:42.371 --> 00:58:47.371
<v Speaker 1>I've been in big fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the crowd's not there just to see </v>

1383
00:58:47.371 --> 00:58:47.380
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there to see all fighters.</v>

1384
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at a fire and a kid,</v>

1385
00:58:49.361 --> 00:58:50.380
<v Speaker 1>whether it's 800,</v>
<v Speaker 1>900 people,</v>

1386
00:58:50.381 --> 00:58:55.381
<v Speaker 1>he sold out shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really there to see Brian and </v>

1387
00:58:55.381 --> 00:58:55.381
<v Speaker 1>Brendan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the love I get from that,</v>

1388
00:58:55.381 --> 00:58:56.360
<v Speaker 1>do I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been seeking it,</v>

1389
00:58:56.410 --> 00:59:00.670
<v Speaker 1>looking for it my entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my entire life for this approval.</v>

1390
00:59:00.671 --> 00:59:05.671
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For this fucking approval my entire </v>

1391
00:59:05.671 --> 00:59:06.040
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me not to cry,</v>

1392
00:59:06.041 --> 00:59:07.120
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I get done with them,</v>

1393
00:59:07.121 --> 00:59:09.830
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me to repeat too.</v>

1394
00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.740
<v Speaker 1>That's Irvine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1395
00:59:11.741 --> 00:59:12.700

<v Speaker 1>I think there's tickets left.</v>

1397
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a fat room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait man.</v>

1398
00:59:17.231 --> 00:59:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the.</v>

1399
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:20.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like superbowl Sunday for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1400
00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:22.280
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>

1401
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Now you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1402
00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:29.970
<v Speaker 1>They don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God brain trauma hasn't kicked in </v>

1403
00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:29.970
<v Speaker 1>where I can still fuck dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha.</v>

1404
00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Brain the fuck out of yourself on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>daily.</v>

1405
00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:36.041
<v Speaker 1>Eventually they're going to have stem </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells and shoot it in there and you're </v>

1406
00:59:36.041 --> 00:59:36.041
<v Speaker 1>going to be a super brainiac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>

1407
00:59:36.041 --> 00:59:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to get too smart though,</v>

1408
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:41.771
<v Speaker 1>because if you get too smart you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll consider the repercussions of </v>

1409
00:59:41.771 --> 00:59:42.630
<v Speaker 1>saying what you're about to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know right now I'm just like,</v>

1410
00:59:42.631 --> 00:59:47.631
<v Speaker 1>that fucking dog just go insane stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep a certain amount of stupid on </v>

1411
00:59:47.631 --> 00:59:50.260
<v Speaker 1>hand just for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do do.</v>

1412
00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount of like if I </v>

1413
00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.420
<v Speaker 1>wanted to really go fucking sot nom </v>
<v Speaker 1>namaz day and fucking meditate all day.</v>

1414
00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.550
<v Speaker 1>The problem is I could kind of go there </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1415
00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Those guys aren't funny though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they?</v>

1416
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the kind of funny I do.</v>

1417
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean people get bruised up fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of comedy people get bruised up.</v>

1418
01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:12.460
<v Speaker 1>The thing is if people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't have a opinion on what </v>

1419
01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>you're doing one way or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing shit son.</v>

1420
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Well I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you either want people that you want </v>

1421
01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>more people to like you and hate you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need both.</v>

1422
01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:19.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We released podcasts.</v>

1423
01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I get all these hateful things and good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing like,</v>

1424
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:22.280
<v Speaker 1>perfect ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing good.</v>

1425
01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:27.340
<v Speaker 1>I know what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the kind of comedy that I like </v>

1426
01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:27.340
<v Speaker 1>and that's the kind of comedy that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to do.</v>

1427
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like calm comedy and chaos.</v>

1428
01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Like I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like watching people have fun.</v>

1429
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1430
01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:37.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only a couple ways to do that.</v>

1431
01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:42.221
<v Speaker 1>And there it's always the subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters are always going to be </v>

1432
01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:42.221
<v Speaker 1>controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1433
01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:46.990
<v Speaker 1>like I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Dee is my favorite all time comic </v>

1434
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:46.990
<v Speaker 1>because he's a 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial.</v>

1435
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>His take on everything is always going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be controversial.</v>

1436
01:00:49.381 --> 01:00:54.381
<v Speaker 1>It's always going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you go to a show because you </v>

1437
01:00:54.381 --> 01:00:54.381
<v Speaker 1>don't want to hear what the average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1438
01:00:54.381 --> 01:00:57.980
<v Speaker 1>you want to see outrageous shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he's a rock and roll comic.</v>

1439
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're watching some fucking </v>

1440
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>rock and roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Watch it.</v>

1441
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Some chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want the best.</v>

1442
01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:09.820
<v Speaker 1>That's why when someone has an opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's why I don't watch these </v>

1443
01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.581
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's nfl or UFC where I know </v>

1444
01:01:12.581 --> 01:01:12.581
<v Speaker 1>who's paying their bills.</v>

1445
01:01:12.581 --> 01:01:15.530
<v Speaker 1>So they don't give a real opinion like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bitch tell it like it is.</v>

1446
01:01:15.531 --> 01:01:17.630
<v Speaker 1>That's why they wouldn't let you on UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

1447
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>That's why 100 percent they got rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

1448
01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:22.070
<v Speaker 1>why they got rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because also my,</v>

1449
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing so well my own shit with </v>

1450
01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>finding the kid and these live tours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they,</v>

1451
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:32.230
<v Speaker 1>they wanted me to drive to Burbank to </v>
<v Speaker 1>film the show and do all this stuff </v>

1452
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.230
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay me this much,</v>

1453
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm worth.</v>

1454
01:01:32.331 --> 01:01:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1455
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get this dude for this.</v>

1456
01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1457
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Good luck getting that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

1458
01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand your value.</v>

1459
01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:45.490
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is one thing where if I </v>

1460
01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:49.301
<v Speaker 1>could give the UFC advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's one thing that I would say is </v>

1461
01:01:49.301 --> 01:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>turn guys loose to turn guys lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't beat themselves.</v>

1462
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>What makes the UFC special?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're looking at baseball.</v>

1463
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:58.960
<v Speaker 1>It's on a downward trend because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have all these rules and guys can't be </v>

1464
01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.081
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have so many personalities and to </v>

1465
01:02:02.081 --> 01:02:02.081
<v Speaker 1>become a fucking cage fighter and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwear,</v>

1466
01:02:02.081 --> 01:02:06.400
<v Speaker 1>you got to be pretty fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get these cool colorful </v>

1467
01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:06.400
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want that man.</v>

1468
01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Let that fucking go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember?</v>

1469
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when Matt Brown got in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble for talking about like Rhonda?</v>

1470
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:16.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not watching list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women are naked.</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1474
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:26.340
<v Speaker 3>he did a video the other day on </v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram of him with his kid on his lap</v>

1475
01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:29.240
<v Speaker 3>and his kids like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you like being cute and you know,</v>

1476

<v Speaker 3>little little tiny baby and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard being hard fucking savages </v>

<v Speaker 3>lifts and punching people in the Dick </v>

<v Speaker 3>fucking baby dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does he have a fight coming up?</v>

1479
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1480
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:55.070

<v Speaker 3>but why do I think he pulled out or </v>

1481
01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:58.080
<v Speaker 3>something or the FYC I canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't he supposed to be fighting?</v>

1482
01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Why do I think he was supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting Damien Maia?</v>

1483
01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:02.010
<v Speaker 3>Because he's the last guy to beat </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderboy.</v>

1484
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like four or five years ago </v>

1485

<v Speaker 3>See if we could find that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there was a great fight that</v>

1487
01:03:10.951 --> 01:03:13.920
<v Speaker 3>was coming up that was super excited for</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and it got canceled.</v>

1488
01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:17.670
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any interest coupon whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mcgregor's fight Aldo next.</v>

1489
01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:23.210
<v Speaker 3>I think there's going to be frank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you fight Frankie Edgar's away </v>

1490
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:25.970
<v Speaker 3>easier sell the Aldo fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aldo comes back and wins and wins in </v>

1491
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:30.681
<v Speaker 3>spectacular fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if Aldo in cups wants and have </v>

1492
01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:34.221
<v Speaker 3>a rematch because cub swanson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although went the same way that Frankie </v>

1493
01:03:34.221 --> 01:03:37.540
<v Speaker 3>Mcgregor when although jumps out them </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit some of the flying knee two seconds </v>

1494
01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:40.560
<v Speaker 3>into the fight and cracks him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't sell Aldo Mcgregor too.</v>

1495
01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:43.350
<v Speaker 3>You can sell frankie just like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

1496
01:03:43.351 --> 01:03:47.070
<v Speaker 3>Because all he's got to win again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he wins again,</v>

1497
01:03:47.071 --> 01:03:49.830
<v Speaker 3>see the differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could sell it,</v>

1498
01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:55.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't sell it for as much as if </v>

1499
01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:55.170
<v Speaker 3>although one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1500
01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:55.170
<v Speaker 3>Damien Maia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1501
01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:55.400
<v Speaker 3>It was right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1502
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.430
<v Speaker 3>UFC One 98.</v>

1503
01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:01.850
<v Speaker 3>That's in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's overdue.</v>

1504
01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:05.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm steep in meal check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll be doing a fight companion because</v>

1505
01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Joseph will be here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

1506
01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.170
<v Speaker 3>that is the weekend of my daughter's </v>
<v Speaker 3>birthday.</v>

1507
01:04:10.171 --> 01:04:15.171
<v Speaker 3>So I can't go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back to go back to what you were </v>

1508
01:04:15.171 --> 01:04:15.570
<v Speaker 3>saying about Mcgregor and Aldo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1509
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:19.590
<v Speaker 3>So although would have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would have to,</v>

1510
01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean redeemed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'd have to be some.</v>

1511
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Something you could sell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like when manny Pacquiao got </v>

1512
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:28.110
<v Speaker 3>knocked dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The floyd may where the fight was off,</v>

1513
01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.410
<v Speaker 3>but then he beats Chris Algieri.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1514
01:04:30.411 --> 01:04:33.510
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a fucking demon again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It starts looking fantastic and go,</v>

1515
01:04:33.511 --> 01:04:35.070
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can see it.</v>

1516
01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.380
<v Speaker 3>We can see it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they sold the fight.</v>

1517
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:41.910
<v Speaker 3>But if they tried to go right from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Juan Manwell Marquez knockout right into</v>

1518
01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:42.630
<v Speaker 3>fort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe with the fight.</v>

1519
01:04:42.631 --> 01:04:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fighter as to when Joe,</v>

1520
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:46.160
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1521
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:49.920
<v Speaker 3>That's why like for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Misha,</v>

1522
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.280
<v Speaker 3>I want Michelle Holly to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want me show Rhonda?</v>

1523
01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.640
<v Speaker 3>Really use it for a third time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1524
01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.010
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1525
01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.460
<v Speaker 3>I think Misha has a mission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better now.</v>

1526
01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:00.980
<v Speaker 3>It'd be interesting to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1527
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:02.610
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do that,</v>

1528
01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:04.330
<v Speaker 3>but she's the champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me.</v>

1529
01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:09.340
<v Speaker 3>She's the fucking champ now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's because she's lost her </v>

1530
01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.740
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda twice already and didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>come close to being there.</v>

1531
01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:13.140
<v Speaker 3>She so she could lose to Amanda Nunez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amanda Newman.</v>

1532
01:05:13.141 --> 01:05:18.141
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I can't toss them in a Nunez </v>

1533
01:05:18.141 --> 01:05:21.441
<v Speaker 3>in there right now because there's only </v>
<v Speaker 3>three bitches who can fight right now </v>

1534
01:05:21.441 --> 01:05:21.441
<v Speaker 3>that we're going to pay to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1535
01:05:21.441 --> 01:05:22.900
<v Speaker 3>So you have Meesha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holly,</v>

1536
01:05:22.901 --> 01:05:23.530
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1537
01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:28.790
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably till November is what they're </v>

1538
01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:28.790
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically eight months just because a</v>

1539
01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:29.560
<v Speaker 3>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows.</v>

1540
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:31.630
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you heard he's her ass back up now</v>

1541
01:05:31.631 --> 01:05:32.740
<v Speaker 3>that Mitch has champ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1542
01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because who knows man.</v>

1543
01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:39.340
<v Speaker 3>So let's say one chooses to fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently and not engage her and fight</v>

1544
01:05:39.341 --> 01:05:40.510
<v Speaker 3>the way she fought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly.</v>

1545
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.420
<v Speaker 3>She fights holly and fight smart and </v>
<v Speaker 3>measured bro.</v>

1546
01:05:43.421 --> 01:05:46.810
<v Speaker 3>She was getting her ass whupped against </v>
<v Speaker 3>holly until she pulled that out.</v>

1547
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:52.230
<v Speaker 3>She was definitely losing shuffling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting whooped though I wouldn't say </v>

1548
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:55.660
<v Speaker 3>she's her face was well taken care of at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nfl stuff face especially with 35 </v>

1549
01:05:56.141 --> 01:05:59.410
<v Speaker 3>pound girl and she never got rocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her knees never buckled.</v>

1550
01:05:59.411 --> 01:06:04.411
<v Speaker 3>She never like looked like she was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>down as down three to one until she was </v>

1551
01:06:04.411 --> 01:06:06.700
<v Speaker 3>definitely down in points,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nothing holly was doing was carrie.</v>

1552
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:12.240
<v Speaker 3>She was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly was fighting real smart and she </v>

1553
01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.341
<v Speaker 3>was moving and can completely control </v>
<v Speaker 3>the control of the standup at Michigan </v>

1554
01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:18.010
<v Speaker 3>to win this and I was talking to Brian </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the fire went and it's like,</v>

1555
01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:23.500
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's always second best because she's </v>

1556
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:23.500
<v Speaker 3>champ.</v>

1557
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:23.500
<v Speaker 3>She's a great champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looks good.</v>

1558
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:24.820
<v Speaker 3>She talks good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She represents good for.</v>

1559
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.830
<v Speaker 3>For Women in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say all those things.</v>

1560
01:06:26.831 --> 01:06:27.700
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1561
01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:28.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's.</v>

1562
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.870
<v Speaker 3>She's a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a really nice person.</v>

1563
01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:36.320
<v Speaker 3>She's great and she's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's holiday show.</v>

1564
01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she is.</v>

1565
01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:40.330
<v Speaker 3>That's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially that ass from the house.</v>

1566
01:06:40.331 --> 01:06:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Respect Brian Caraway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a.</v>

1567
01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.960
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about this on the podcast.</v>

1568
01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:48.010
<v Speaker 3>I think that nobody talks about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real love story.</v>

1569
01:06:48.011 --> 01:06:50.410
<v Speaker 3>That's an American love story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian Caraway,</v>

1570
01:06:50.411 --> 01:06:54.190
<v Speaker 3>so in her corner and he gets very </v>
<v Speaker 3>romantic.</v>

1571
01:06:54.191 --> 01:06:56.460
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1572
01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to cry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let it relax a little bit,</v>

1573
01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.570
<v Speaker 3>but you won't shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody gives.</v>

1574
01:07:01.571 --> 01:07:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Nobody talks about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1575
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:08.670
<v Speaker 3>I almost cried again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost cried again was when I was </v>

1576
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:08.670
<v Speaker 3>interviewing me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1577
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:10.060
<v Speaker 3>because she finally did it when she </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1578
01:07:10.061 --> 01:07:11.140
<v Speaker 3>when I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's that sound?</v>

1579
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:16.140
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been waiting to hear you say those </v>

1580
01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:16.140
<v Speaker 3>words for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she was going to retire.</v>

1581
01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:17.770
<v Speaker 3>How about she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not getting my shot.</v>

1582
01:07:17.771 --> 01:07:19.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about it.</v>

1583
01:07:19.751 --> 01:07:21.310
<v Speaker 3>You know what she's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what she's doing with her life.</v>

1584
01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:23.800
<v Speaker 3>She has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1585
01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.080
<v Speaker 3>if let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>run it for whatever.</v>

1586
01:07:26.081 --> 01:07:28.030
<v Speaker 3>You can't fight til November.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what,</v>

1587
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:29.260
<v Speaker 3>eight months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1588
01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not do Holly Meesha to.</v>

1589
01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you certainly could.</v>

1590
01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was the only other fight you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can do,</v>

1591
01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:38.560
<v Speaker 3>but the problem with that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his mom's not really a problem with that</v>

1592
01:07:38.561 --> 01:07:40.570
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the worst that happens?</v>

1593
01:07:40.571 --> 01:07:41.800
<v Speaker 3>Holly Wins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have holly,</v>

1594
01:07:41.801 --> 01:07:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we want to see.</v>

1595
01:07:43.061 --> 01:07:44.840
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the biggest blockbuster.</v>

1596
01:07:44.850 --> 01:07:46.860
<v Speaker 3>Finding the history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>

1597
01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:48.970
<v Speaker 3>Because you've lost that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You definitely,</v>

1598
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:52.030
<v Speaker 3>but I would like to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is the timeframe,</v>

1599
01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:54.730
<v Speaker 3>but I would like to see Ronda versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>Meesha,</v>

1600
01:07:54.731 --> 01:07:56.740
<v Speaker 3>but what if me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wants to sit it out,</v>

1601
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:57.370
<v Speaker 3>would have me.</v>

1602
01:07:57.370 --> 01:08:02.370
<v Speaker 3>She wants to wait for Ronda and she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained like a fucking demon for h is </v>

1603
01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:04.840
<v Speaker 3>what holly should have done and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>should have just been on this pr fucking</v>

1604
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:09.870
<v Speaker 3>tour to build her celebrity up so high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by the time her and Rhonda fight is </v>

1605
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:14.041
<v Speaker 3>the biggest fight in UFC history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get Dan on the phone and </v>

1606
01:08:14.041 --> 01:08:14.041
<v Speaker 3>have him hire you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1607
01:08:14.041 --> 01:08:18.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what the agreed with that he </v>

1608
01:08:18.570 --> 01:08:20.300
<v Speaker 3>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what Dana was saying was he had a</v>

1609
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:21.960
<v Speaker 3>blast out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People think I don't like Dana.</v>

1610
01:08:21.970 --> 01:08:22.970
<v Speaker 3>I'd like Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1611
01:08:22.971 --> 01:08:24.830
<v Speaker 3>We just disagree on certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who gives a fuck?</v>

1612
01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:25.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1613
01:08:25.381 --> 01:08:26.690
<v Speaker 3>I when I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because Dana goes,</v>

1614
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she should have waited,</v>

1615
01:08:28.311 --> 01:08:33.311
<v Speaker 3>but we had a meeting with her manager </v>
<v Speaker 3>choosing me in on the meeting and they </v>

1616
01:08:33.311 --> 01:08:33.410
<v Speaker 3>wanted to hurry up and fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think was a mistake.</v>

1617
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:35.300
<v Speaker 3>He's 100 percent correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1618
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:38.930
<v Speaker 3>100 percent correct financially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you gotta respect her as a warrior.</v>

1619
01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:44.150
<v Speaker 3>What she wanted to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joel wanted to get in there and people </v>

1620
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:46.230
<v Speaker 3>in a throw down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People argue that on the title that you </v>

1621
01:08:46.230 --> 01:08:49.450
<v Speaker 3>had been a better fighter fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're an armchair quarterback when </v>

1622
01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:49.880
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about Monday morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day of the fight.</v>

1623
01:08:49.881 --> 01:08:54.170
<v Speaker 3>She could have one and if she did one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would look like even pros and cons.</v>

1624
01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about when people say,</v>

1625
01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:57.200
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but such a warrior.</v>

1626
01:08:57.350 --> 01:09:02.350
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a warrior doesn't pay the fucking </v>

1627
01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:02.350
<v Speaker 3>bills 20 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true,</v>

1628
01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:03.230
<v Speaker 3>but you gotta understand she made a fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>load of money for that.</v>

1629
01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:06.290
<v Speaker 3>She will wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would have made so much more fucking</v>

1630
01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:07.720
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say she's gonna have.</v>

1631
01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:10.120
<v Speaker 3>She's gonna have a shot at Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to have holly,</v>

1632
01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:12.500
<v Speaker 3>I think holly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who knows how many.</v>

1633
01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:15.630
<v Speaker 3>This is the risk and the risk and MMA </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1634
01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.500
<v Speaker 3>Look when Connor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Carter loses to Frankie Edgar,</v>

1635
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:21.570
<v Speaker 3>which is a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a scary fighter.</v>

1636
01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:22.280
<v Speaker 3>Conor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

1637
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:27.550
<v Speaker 3>very strong and so it's so in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he loses to nate,</v>

1638
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:31.040
<v Speaker 3>now we lose it to Frankie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That luster.</v>

1639
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:33.650
<v Speaker 3>That time is gone and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1640
01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:36.640
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still has an email right now.</v>

1641
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:40.250
<v Speaker 3>He still that because he lost a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>savage at one system.</v>

1642
01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:44.090
<v Speaker 3>That's a biggie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Edgar is a 48 hour storm.</v>

1643
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:47.480
<v Speaker 3>You better have everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chad Mendez the fuck.</v>

1644
01:09:47.481 --> 01:09:49.760
<v Speaker 3>He said 48 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I get tired?</v>

1645
01:09:49.761 --> 01:09:51.670
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not getting tired and he's going to</v>

1646
01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:56.780
<v Speaker 3>wrestle his ass and he's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come at you crazy angles.</v>

1647
01:09:56.781 --> 01:09:58.310
<v Speaker 3>His footwork is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since this is the problem.</v>

1648
01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.780
<v Speaker 3>This is smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem though,</v>

1649
01:09:59.781 --> 01:10:02.180
<v Speaker 3>if connor connects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which friend he does get hit.</v>

1650
01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1651
01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:09.520
<v Speaker 3>You think in La Conner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean frankie could get knocked out of </v>

1652
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:11.920
<v Speaker 3>Connecticut at 1:45</v>

<v Speaker 3>anybody be so heavy head by the way.</v>

1655
01:10:16.491 --> 01:10:19.250
<v Speaker 3>So we'll cub Swanson and cub Swanson </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't connect on forgotten.</v>

1656
01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Birthed in me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frankie just wolverine dim just for </v>

1657
01:10:24.291 --> 01:10:24.920
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

1658
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:30.750
<v Speaker 3>very possible deviled them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all the know condoms got to </v>

1659
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:34.541
<v Speaker 3>suck a lot of weights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very hard soccer him and it's a five </v>

1660
01:10:34.541 --> 01:10:37.751
<v Speaker 3>round fight and man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if anybody can grind you into the </v>

1661
01:10:37.751 --> 01:10:37.751
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1662
01:10:37.751 --> 01:10:38.600
<v Speaker 3>it's that guy and you're at the Chad </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mendez fight.</v>

1663
01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Obviously Connor had a knee injury going</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that fight,</v>

1664
01:10:40.641 --> 01:10:42.850
<v Speaker 3>but Chad took him down at will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1665
01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.200
<v Speaker 3>and that'll be when frankie gets you </v>
<v Speaker 3>tired.</v>

1666
01:10:45.201 --> 01:10:50.201
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna get in trouble when he did </v>

1667
01:10:50.201 --> 01:10:50.201
<v Speaker 3>two cups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one cub.</v>

1668
01:10:50.201 --> 01:10:52.900
<v Speaker 3>Swanson rather was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he just wore him.</v>

1669
01:10:52.901 --> 01:10:53.800
<v Speaker 3>Never seen an ass whooping.</v>

1670
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:58.810
<v Speaker 3>Like really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's getting cub cub as far I've seen </v>

1671
01:10:58.810 --> 01:11:01.631
<v Speaker 3>everyone in the gym club is the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>talented guy if ever seen in the jail </v>

1672
01:11:01.631 --> 01:11:04.280
<v Speaker 3>watches tennis gave or fight insane how </v>
<v Speaker 3>talented that kid is.</v>

1673
01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:07.840
<v Speaker 3>So when I saw frankie just dismantling </v>
<v Speaker 3>with whole wheat,</v>

1674
01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:09.770
<v Speaker 3>Frankie Edgar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1675
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:10.970
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his footwork,</v>

1676
01:11:10.971 --> 01:11:12.560
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's his boxing's great.</v>

1677
01:11:12.561 --> 01:11:13.470
<v Speaker 3>Hard to hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1678
01:11:13.471 --> 01:11:15.720
<v Speaker 3>whether or not probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know the numbers,</v>

1679
01:11:15.721 --> 01:11:18.120
<v Speaker 3>but I would assume I don't think he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>drawl,</v>

1680
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.750
<v Speaker 3>but if snob.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you give them a car,</v>

1681
01:11:20.751 --> 01:11:22.770
<v Speaker 3>you're good because he's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>drawer.</v>

1682
01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.460
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm asking is that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>connor's manager and if you're connor,</v>

1683
01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:31.730
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it make sense to somehow duck </v>
<v Speaker 3>frankie in the interim fight Aldo for </v>

1684
01:11:31.981 --> 01:11:33.330
<v Speaker 3>the big money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy fight,</v>

1685
01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:37.320
<v Speaker 3>but all you see you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless although winds,</v>

1686
01:11:37.321 --> 01:11:42.321
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you how you're going to sell</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that when he starts them at 16 </v>

1687
01:11:42.321 --> 01:11:45.651
<v Speaker 3>because he was a champion for 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>and also that starching with happen so </v>

1688
01:11:45.651 --> 01:11:45.651
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>

1689
01:11:45.651 --> 01:11:49.790
<v Speaker 3>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in shit because I want to know if </v>

1690
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:51.651
<v Speaker 3>that was a fluke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm interested a little bit </v>

1691
01:11:51.651 --> 01:11:51.651
<v Speaker 3>run out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Brian,</v>

1692
01:11:51.651 --> 01:11:51.651
<v Speaker 3>you could sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could sell it,</v>

1693
01:11:51.651 --> 01:11:54.150
<v Speaker 3>but you're not going to sell it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>nearly as much as you would sell it.</v>

1694
01:11:54.151 --> 01:11:57.810
<v Speaker 3>If all the wind something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to fight all the fights.</v>

1695
01:11:57.811 --> 01:12:02.811
<v Speaker 3>Max Holloway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about what have you tried some Max </v>

1696
01:12:02.811 --> 01:12:05.091
<v Speaker 3>all the way and he fights fight so it </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like the Aldo of old or he gets </v>

1697
01:12:06.691 --> 01:12:11.691
<v Speaker 3>his ass whooped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of those guys emerges and then </v>

1698
01:12:11.691 --> 01:12:14.541
<v Speaker 3>you've got the possibility of Max </v>
<v Speaker 3>Holloway having a rematch with connor </v>

1699
01:12:14.541 --> 01:12:16.310
<v Speaker 3>connor to a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need some young blood in Mexico,</v>

1700
01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:21.420
<v Speaker 3>a fucking fucker mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some young bloods only like 24,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's got a fight coming up though.</v>

1704
01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.210
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't Max Holloway have a fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aldo UFC 200.</v>

1705
01:12:39.211 --> 01:12:41.640
<v Speaker 3>Make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do I feel like he's got a good fight</v>

1706
01:12:41.641 --> 01:12:44.160
<v Speaker 3>scheduled like that I'm interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is He fighting llamas?</v>

1707
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:48.240
<v Speaker 3>You fight and Ricardo Lamas because </v>
<v Speaker 3>llamas just fought.</v>

1708
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:53.000
<v Speaker 3>Diego Diego's only appearance at 45.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was way too sucked up.</v>

1709

<v Speaker 3>What is he?</v>

1711
01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:58.860

01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:58.100
<v Speaker 3>Vetoer verses Luke rockhold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1828
01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:03.250
<v Speaker 3>we might've brought up TRT Vitorin when </v>
<v Speaker 3>we get together about every time our </v>

1829
01:18:03.250 --> 01:18:04.970
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a psycho man.</v>

1830
01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:08.990
<v Speaker 3>I need me for a loop and this just </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't my fucking world.</v>

1831
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:14.410
<v Speaker 3>Kimbo and Ken shamrock busted for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming.</v>

1832
01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:16.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1833
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:18.260
<v Speaker 3>Them by Lord lead him there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a demon.</v>

1834
01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:23.300
<v Speaker 3>Luke rockhold and is all natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like surfing and just a basic </v>

1835
01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:24.110
<v Speaker 3>ass haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rockhold looks like a school boy there.</v>

1836
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:25.170
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1837
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:27.780
<v Speaker 3>His fucking face kicked off in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1838
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Roger told me 14 hours and get your face</v>
<v Speaker 3>kick though.</v>

1839
01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.500
<v Speaker 3>He told me he saw him at the weigh ins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1840
01:18:33.501 --> 01:18:36.650
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this guy on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1841
01:18:36.651 --> 01:18:39.740
<v Speaker 3>just you could tell just looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Vito whispered in his ear,</v>

1842
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:40.300
<v Speaker 3>afraid.</v>

1843
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his skin,</v>

1844
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:44.270
<v Speaker 3>he's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's training.</v>

1845
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:47.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is not just the fact that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was on trt,</v>

1846
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:52.330
<v Speaker 3>which you most certainly was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also the fact that he was training </v>

1847
01:18:52.330 --> 01:18:54.680
<v Speaker 3>like a fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's him all sucked up though.</v>

1848
01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:58.520
<v Speaker 3>That's at the winds when he's pointing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to is Jesus Waste Bella band there?</v>

1849
01:18:58.580 --> 01:18:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1850
01:18:59.091 --> 01:19:04.091
<v Speaker 3>We see like above that Jesus throw that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll kick you out like that's him when </v>

1851
01:19:04.091 --> 01:19:05.090
<v Speaker 3>he will kicked rock holding the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1852
01:19:05.091 --> 01:19:07.460
<v Speaker 3>look how big he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Jesus Christ.</v>

1853
01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:10.160
<v Speaker 3>So the reason why I think he's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scariest,</v>

1854
01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:14.090
<v Speaker 3>he's because he's got a massive amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of experience.</v>

1855
01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:17.000
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about the guy who has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been fighting since 97.</v>

1856
01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.040
<v Speaker 3>He's been training since,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1857
01:19:19.041 --> 01:19:20.210
<v Speaker 3>years before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1858
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:25.220
<v Speaker 3>So he's been around for ever almost 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years in the game.</v>

1859
01:19:25.221 --> 01:19:29.420
<v Speaker 3>He's in his ups and downs at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highest,</v>

1860
01:19:29.421 --> 01:19:34.421
<v Speaker 3>highest level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the highest level and he's only like </v>

1861
01:19:34.421 --> 01:19:34.421
<v Speaker 3>38 now.</v>

1862
01:19:34.421 --> 01:19:35.930
<v Speaker 3>I think he just turned 38 if I get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly,</v>

1863
01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.630
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Such a nice guy.</v>

1864
01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:41.480
<v Speaker 3>Very nice because like the Nice Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very nice guy,</v>

1865
01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.490
<v Speaker 3>v towards a smart guy too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1866
01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:45.940
<v Speaker 3>and he speaks very fluent English as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well as uh,</v>

1867
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:47.170
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as uh,</v>

1868
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:49.370
<v Speaker 3>as well as a Brazilian Portuguese </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather.</v>

1869
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:54.550
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at his body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what you have is this freak body </v>

1870
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:59.501
<v Speaker 3>that also has all this knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And usually by the time a guy acquires </v>

1871
01:19:59.501 --> 01:20:00.380
<v Speaker 3>all that knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his body starts to fall down.</v>

1872
01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:02.570
<v Speaker 3>I had a conversation with Eve Edwards </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

1873
01:20:02.571 --> 01:20:03.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about like,</v>

1874
01:20:03.801 --> 01:20:06.740
<v Speaker 3>eve is super knowledgeable guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many fights.</v>

1875
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 3>He's had so many fights</v>

1876
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:11.520
<v Speaker 4>and it's almost like his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knows so much now,</v>

1877
01:20:11.521 --> 01:20:15.300
<v Speaker 4>but his body just doesn't cooperate like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it did when he was young and wild.</v>

1878
01:20:15.301 --> 01:20:16.010
<v Speaker 4>Bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1879
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.540
<v Speaker 4>Back in the Aaron Riley days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever seen his fights with Erin Wiley and</v>

1880
01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:19.470
<v Speaker 4>hook and shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1881
01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:24.860
<v Speaker 4>And then you see a lot of guys who have </v>
<v Speaker 4>resurgens we were talking about this </v>

1882
01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:24.860
<v Speaker 4>like heavy weights and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who,</v>

1883
01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:25.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Ben Rothwell,</v>

1884
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:27.510
<v Speaker 4>guys like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who victoire I mean,</v>

1885
01:20:27.511 --> 01:20:28.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1886
01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:29.040
<v Speaker 4>fabrizio like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>

1887
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:30.930
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll see them when they get to be like</v>

1888
01:20:30.931 --> 01:20:32.250
<v Speaker 4>in their thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1889
01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:32.760
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

1890
01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:35.190
<v Speaker 4>they get into thirties and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting differently.</v>

1891
01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:36.720
<v Speaker 4>That's heavyweights though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1892
01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:41.840
<v Speaker 4>Well wait until January,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a longer career and later we'll </v>

1893
01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.040
<v Speaker 4>guys be thinking about coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they genuinely don't know how to</v>

1894
01:20:44.041 --> 01:20:47.280
<v Speaker 4>move their body as well when they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>younger because there's so much mass.</v>

1895
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.800
<v Speaker 4>I think if you look at like little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1896
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:54.950
<v Speaker 4>like one of the things I've noticed </v>
<v Speaker 4>about having kids is you want to like </v>

1897
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:56.460
<v Speaker 4>kids in gymnastics class and the shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can do with their body.</v>

1898
01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:58.730
<v Speaker 4>It's not just like flexibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no wait,</v>

1899
01:20:58.930 --> 01:21:00.800
<v Speaker 4>there's no mass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're like,</v>

1900
01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:02.130
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even their body around,</v>

1901
01:21:02.131 --> 01:21:07.131
<v Speaker 4>they're rolling around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing flips and they develop </v>

1902
01:21:07.131 --> 01:21:10.490
<v Speaker 4>like an understanding of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also being able to measure like a </v>

1903
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:15.380
<v Speaker 4>Chris Vineyard was explaining to me how </v>
<v Speaker 4>though as you get better and better at </v>

1904
01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:16.140
<v Speaker 4>boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to move less because you're.</v>

1905
01:21:16.141 --> 01:21:21.141
<v Speaker 4>I can measure shots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so instead of like really moving to the </v>

1906
01:21:21.141 --> 01:21:25.251
<v Speaker 4>side like a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just literally step back like an </v>

1907
01:21:25.251 --> 01:21:28.401
<v Speaker 4>inch gets you to miss and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll experience experience is </v>

1908

1959
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:32.970

01:27:30.171 --> 01:27:33.770
<v Speaker 3>like having a rock under your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see that one.</v>

2056
01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:36.260
<v Speaker 3>You see that one too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looked like.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see into her fucking see your brain.</v>

2058
01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:43.670

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2062
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:51.590
<v Speaker 3>It's going to grow back if you keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>

2063
01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Isn't she a Cesar Gracie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2064
01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:55.660
<v Speaker 3>I think she's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2065
01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:00.760
<v Speaker 3>Cesar Gracie nor cowgirls and fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it for a living man.</v>

2066
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:03.230
<v Speaker 3>You gotTa love fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's tough as fuck.</v>

2067
01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:04.700
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Picture man.</v>

2069
01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:11.300
<v Speaker 3>She looks like an anime like doll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know she is paid to do that shit.</v>

2070
01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.510
<v Speaker 3>They think about how fucking tough Josh </v>
<v Speaker 3>Birkman is.</v>

2071
01:28:13.511 --> 01:28:18.511
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about Hector Lombard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Josh Berkman who just fought his last </v>

2072
01:28:18.511 --> 01:28:21.461
<v Speaker 3>fight and one at 55 veterans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought Lombard and locked it,</v>

2073
01:28:22.110 --> 01:28:24.830
<v Speaker 3>sat in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sat there in the pocket is sick.</v>

2074
01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:28.190
<v Speaker 3>She went into that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Antibiotics I fucked up.</v>

2075
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:30.190
<v Speaker 3>That's the fight that hector test </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive for it.</v>

2076
01:28:30.191 --> 01:28:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the fight.</v>

2077
01:28:30.690 --> 01:28:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Hector content and Berkman just sat </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and just kinda parried and stayed </v>

2078
01:28:35.690 --> 01:28:36.330
<v Speaker 3>pretty much mark less.</v>

2079
01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:40.320
<v Speaker 3>I just want to state dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why Lombard,</v>

2080
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:42.410
<v Speaker 3>especially when lumbar started to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little tired.</v>

2081
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:47.530
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to come in because bomb </v>
<v Speaker 3>wing and bombs at you and he can.</v>

2082
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:49.560
<v Speaker 3>You could hit him with a bat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2083
01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.800
<v Speaker 3>That motherfucker take a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2084
01:28:51.810 --> 01:28:53.960
<v Speaker 3>he didn't take it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just tough.</v>

2085
01:28:54.230 --> 01:28:57.260
<v Speaker 3>Berchmans been around and he's fought as</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy as to.</v>

2086
01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2087
01:28:58.731 --> 01:29:01.260
<v Speaker 3>He fought Jeremy Horn once and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what the fuck.</v>

2088
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:06.290
<v Speaker 3>They had some crazy dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was some argument when they hated </v>

2089
01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:06.290
<v Speaker 3>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd been fighting for.</v>

2090
01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Horn is like one of the nicest </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys in the world.</v>

2091
01:29:07.501 --> 01:29:12.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Jeremy choked him out and spit on </v>

2092
01:29:12.501 --> 01:29:12.501
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2093
01:29:12.501 --> 01:29:12.870
<v Speaker 3>he was out cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened,</v>

2094
01:29:12.871 --> 01:29:15.810
<v Speaker 3>but Jeremy's the nicest guy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's also a fighter,</v>

2095
01:29:16.450 --> 01:29:19.530
<v Speaker 3>but I'm telling you like the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy,</v>

2096
01:29:19.531 --> 01:29:20.790
<v Speaker 3>he gets so upset at someone.</v>

2097
01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:23.100
<v Speaker 3>It's almost alien to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand it.</v>

2098
01:29:23.370 --> 01:29:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Who Does Nate Diaz fight next?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should fight Robbie lawler at UFC </v>

2099
01:29:28.370 --> 01:29:32.901
<v Speaker 3>200 if no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say dose on Joseph's the fight </v>

2100
01:29:32.901 --> 01:29:33.810
<v Speaker 3>because I think that Robbie lawler is </v>
<v Speaker 3>too big for him.</v>

2101
01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:36.990
<v Speaker 3>If he's going to really fight at one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he should.</v>

2102
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:39.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he could fight at one 70,</v>

2103
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:44.590
<v Speaker 3>make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at like the Rory </v>

2104
01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Macdonald fight and you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2105
01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:46.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a stun gun,</v>

2106
01:29:46.891 --> 01:29:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Kim fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could also,</v>

2107
01:29:49.741 --> 01:29:53.010
<v Speaker 3>you could easily make an argument and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's not even an argument of fact.</v>

2108
01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:56.190
<v Speaker 3>He's a lot better than he was when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>fought Rory Macdonald.</v>

2109
01:29:56.191 --> 01:29:58.080
<v Speaker 3>And he's a lot better than he was when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he fought don young.</v>

2110
01:29:58.081 --> 01:29:59.190
<v Speaker 3>Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think his fight,</v>

2111
01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:02.340
<v Speaker 3>his last fight in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just the conor mcgregor fight,</v>

2112
01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:04.680
<v Speaker 3>but the fight with Michael Johnson ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2113
01:30:04.681 --> 01:30:05.610
<v Speaker 3>he's on fire.</v>

2114
01:30:05.670 --> 01:30:10.670
<v Speaker 3>Nate is comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's confident and nate is one of the </v>

2115
01:30:10.670 --> 01:30:12.480
<v Speaker 3>slickest dudes when it comes to rolling </v>
<v Speaker 3>with punches.</v>

2116
01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:15.360
<v Speaker 3>When kit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when nate gets hit,</v>

2117
01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:19.180
<v Speaker 3>nate gets hit and he goes with shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>going was shit like.</v>

2118
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:24.310
<v Speaker 3>And he's got this like Long Slinky </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking jab that comes out of nowhere.</v>

2119
01:30:24.810 --> 01:30:29.810
<v Speaker 3>You have to give them a super after </v>
<v Speaker 3>being conor mcgregor and he has such </v>

2120
01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:31.710
<v Speaker 3>fucking momentum whether he agrees with </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the UFC does,</v>

2121
01:30:31.711 --> 01:30:34.800
<v Speaker 3>whatever you have to give that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a title shot.</v>

2122
01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Well the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they have to recognize that he's</v>

2123
01:30:39.241 --> 01:30:40.740
<v Speaker 3>a superstar right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nate.</v>

2124
01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:44.400
<v Speaker 3>Nate Diaz is a fucking superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifty five I think.</v>

2125
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:46.700
<v Speaker 3>Fifty five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weight 55 or seven.</v>

2126
01:30:46.710 --> 01:30:48.960
<v Speaker 3>But if you give him 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just give them more than two weeks.</v>

2127
01:30:48.961 --> 01:30:53.961
<v Speaker 3>Notice I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think he has a better chance </v>

2128
01:30:53.961 --> 01:30:55.130
<v Speaker 3>beating Robbie lawler than he does this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2129
01:30:55.190 --> 01:30:57.570
<v Speaker 3>Rob.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a strong man.</v>

2130
01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2131
01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:01.920
<v Speaker 3>they'll Sanchez was his last before he </v>
<v Speaker 3>fought.</v>

2132
01:31:01.921 --> 01:31:06.921
<v Speaker 3>Michael Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those lunges leg kick the shit out of </v>

2133
01:31:06.921 --> 01:31:09.651
<v Speaker 3>them and horrible and mangled them on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground once his leg was all fucked </v>

2134
01:31:09.651 --> 01:31:09.651
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2135
01:31:10.610 --> 01:31:13.510
<v Speaker 3>God damned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Juggernaut bikes.</v>

2136
01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Connor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

2137
01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:15.900
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

2138
01:31:15.901 --> 01:31:17.010
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

2139
01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:17.940
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>

2140
01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:23.340
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Connor's worst matchup supposed </v>

2141
01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:25.641
<v Speaker 3>to see anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it works out well for </v>

2142
01:31:25.641 --> 01:31:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Connor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on man.</v>

2143
01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.580
<v Speaker 3>What if he sleeps?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay.</v>

2144
01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Whack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if you want to purchase them like </v>

2145
01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:34.950
<v Speaker 3>you did all this chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's possible.</v>

2146
01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:38.550
<v Speaker 3>It is possible to go to 1:45</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight Frankie,</v>

2147
01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:43.580
<v Speaker 3>and then let's talk about 54.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he kind of has to defend his </v>

2148
01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:43.580
<v Speaker 3>title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2149
01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:46.060
<v Speaker 3>You can't lose that 70 than fight the </v>
<v Speaker 3>champ at 55 and then go back.</v>

2150
01:31:46.170 --> 01:31:46.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's my.</v>

2151
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:49.680
<v Speaker 3>Here's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a question.</v>

2152
01:31:49.681 --> 01:31:53.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm asking a question.</v>

2153
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:55.200
<v Speaker 3>We go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it possible?</v>

2154
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:56.670
<v Speaker 3>Is it going to take a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2155
01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:00.090
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that conor mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's</v>

2156
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:02.170
<v Speaker 4>an excellent boxer and he's got that </v>
<v Speaker 4>left hand,</v>

2157
01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:05.830
<v Speaker 4>is it possible that we're going to see </v>
<v Speaker 4>people game plan to say,</v>

2158
01:32:05.831 --> 01:32:08.080
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just stay away from that left hand,</v>

2159
01:32:08.081 --> 01:32:11.890
<v Speaker 4>and if you do you can just grab them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>grind them into the ground.</v>

2160
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:15.440
<v Speaker 4>I can get shit for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

2161
01:32:15.441 --> 01:32:16.600
<v Speaker 4>what do you taught?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nothing new.</v>

2162
01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:21.630
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to say a question and you just </v>

2163
01:32:21.630 --> 01:32:21.630
<v Speaker 4>came up with a question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My question,</v>

2164
01:32:21.630 --> 01:32:23.710
<v Speaker 4>my thought it was right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie knows everyone knows,</v>

2165
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:25.870
<v Speaker 4>asked you this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

2166
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:30.990
<v Speaker 4>do you think that if he gets it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess what I'm really asking is you </v>

2167
01:32:30.990 --> 01:32:32.530
<v Speaker 4>spit it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm really asking is,</v>

2168
01:32:32.531 --> 01:32:37.531
<v Speaker 4>is he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is he just really good with that left </v>

2169
01:32:37.531 --> 01:32:38.010
<v Speaker 4>hand and if you negate that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he becomes ordinary,</v>

2170
01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:39.920
<v Speaker 4>but he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an excellent fighter.</v>

2171
01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:42.880
<v Speaker 4>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the last one,</v>

2172
01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:43.480
<v Speaker 4>78.</v>

2173
01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:46.960
<v Speaker 4>You don't just knock out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although with one punch destroy markers,</v>

2174
01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:48.940
<v Speaker 4>image destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Diego Brandao.</v>

2175
01:32:48.941 --> 01:32:50.680
<v Speaker 4>He's destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dennis seaver,</v>

2176
01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:53.740
<v Speaker 4>he looks like a murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smash Chad Mendez.</v>

2177
01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:59.100
<v Speaker 4>Conor mcgregor is a gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no doubt that he just got a </v>

2178
01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:00.960
<v Speaker 4>little crazy if you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anybody.</v>

2179
01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:04.450
<v Speaker 4>He went up all the way up to one 72.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Granted,</v>

2180
01:33:04.451 --> 01:33:06.760
<v Speaker 4>he fought nate Diaz is not a real one 70</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

2181
01:33:06.761 --> 01:33:08.200
<v Speaker 4>but he's a legit one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>50th five.</v>

2182
01:33:08.201 --> 01:33:11.200
<v Speaker 4>We can't make 1:45.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nate can't make 1:45.</v>

2183
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:14.750
<v Speaker 4>You see nate cut down to 55.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is fucking troll reddit.</v>

2184
01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:19.270
<v Speaker 4>So another 10 pounds after that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not gonna happen.</v>

2185
01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:22.420
<v Speaker 4>But Connor could make that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you gotta think that nate is a bigger</v>

2186
01:33:22.421 --> 01:33:27.421
<v Speaker 4>guy and I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Connor's still the biggest draw in the </v>

2187
01:33:27.421 --> 01:33:28.000
<v Speaker 4>UFC because in everyone should take </v>
<v Speaker 4>notes.</v>

2188
01:33:28.001 --> 01:33:31.390
<v Speaker 4>The way he's handled this loss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't go into hiding champ.</v>

2189
01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:33.100
<v Speaker 4>He's not not doing interviews.</v>

2190
01:33:33.250 --> 01:33:35.260
<v Speaker 4>He's not talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just what's up?</v>

2191
01:33:35.261 --> 01:33:35.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took a chance.</v>

2192
01:33:35.951 --> 01:33:39.030
<v Speaker 4>I fucking lost man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will not apologize.</v>

2193
01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:41.240
<v Speaker 4>Took a fucking risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's fucking next?</v>

2194
01:33:41.630 --> 01:33:43.210
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he loaded up on nate.</v>

2195
01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:46.150
<v Speaker 4>He tried to take them out with one shot </v>
<v Speaker 4>at a time and you just can't do that.</v>

2196
01:33:46.210 --> 01:33:51.210
<v Speaker 4>It's just not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not an easy how it keeps us on </v>

2197
01:33:51.210 --> 01:33:51.210
<v Speaker 4>Joe's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Besides knocking them out,</v>

2198
01:33:51.210 --> 01:33:53.010
<v Speaker 4>keeps them away from him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel good question.</v>

2199
01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:54.940
<v Speaker 4>Just grabs him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a big,</v>

2200
01:33:54.970 --> 01:33:56.270
<v Speaker 4>big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally different.</v>

2201
01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:58.630
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen any answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally different animal.</v>

2202
01:33:58.631 --> 01:33:59.780
<v Speaker 4>Physically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's still sound.</v>

2203
01:33:59.810 --> 01:34:02.820
<v Speaker 4>Joe's has these thick ass ankles and </v>
<v Speaker 4>thick as risks.</v>

2204
01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:08.280
<v Speaker 4>Thick ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a thick motherfucker up knocking </v>

2205
01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:11.011
<v Speaker 4>him out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have fun getting kicked in the leg by </v>

2206

<v Speaker 4>his paces in Sadie's breaking dudes.</v>

2207
01:34:13.361 --> 01:34:15.610
<v Speaker 4>Especially at 55.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I watched his fight with pedes,</v>

2208
01:34:15.611 --> 01:34:16.350
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2209
01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:17.890
<v Speaker 4>how's this guy keeping this up?</v>

2210
01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:19.090
<v Speaker 4>See that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the move.</v>

2211
01:34:19.091 --> 01:34:19.520
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

2212
01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:22.390
<v Speaker 4>if I'm Connor's manager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't first take some time off.</v>

2213
01:34:22.391 --> 01:34:24.720
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't fight at UFC 200.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's crazy.</v>

2214
01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:27.670
<v Speaker 4>He's fighting UFC $200.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well why would he not?</v>

2215
01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:32.700
<v Speaker 4>When is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you just bought that fucking </v>

2216
01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:32.700
<v Speaker 4>murked you need a break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Has Do an interviews.</v>

2217
01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:37.630
<v Speaker 4>Twenty four slash seven a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>times a shot for a take down on the </v>

2218
01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:37.810
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Duncan coked out.</v>

2219
01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.720
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you got a concussion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2220
01:34:40.721 --> 01:34:45.721
<v Speaker 4>he got fucking a one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two from fucking Nate Diaz was on </v>

2221
01:34:45.721 --> 01:34:45.850
<v Speaker 4>wobbles street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But is that a congressional fuck?</v>

2222
01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.040
<v Speaker 4>Your shot a double leg?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know he did.</v>

2223
01:34:48.190 --> 01:34:53.190
<v Speaker 4>But what is technically concussion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your brain fucked up and you can double </v>

2224
01:34:53.190 --> 01:34:55.090
<v Speaker 4>and then you revert back to old school </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>

2225
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:56.860
<v Speaker 4>That's when your brain's bruised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2226
01:34:56.890 --> 01:34:57.890
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Medically,</v>

2227
01:34:57.930 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

2228
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.320
<v Speaker 3>medically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's when you bruise your brain.</v>

2229
01:35:00.321 --> 01:35:02.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when will we know that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>got his bell rung.</v>

2230
01:35:02.811 --> 01:35:05.060
<v Speaker 3>We know he got rocked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we saw his legs buckle,</v>

2231
01:35:05.150 --> 01:35:07.910
<v Speaker 3>we saw nate beat the piss out of him on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground before he choked him.</v>

2232
01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all those count.</v>

2233
01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:11.290
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

2234
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:16.330
<v Speaker 3>So I wonder how much damage he did and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder how much time he really should </v>

2235
01:35:16.330 --> 01:35:19.210
<v Speaker 3>take off because it's not the same like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this obviously levels of it.</v>

2236
01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:22.220
<v Speaker 3>Like Rhonda getting head kicked by Holly</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like the highest level.</v>

2237
01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:25.970
<v Speaker 3>The highest level is getting Gonzaga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Gonzaga knocked out,</v>

2238
01:35:25.971 --> 01:35:28.540
<v Speaker 3>cro cop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was like the height that's going to</v>

2239
01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:30.410
<v Speaker 3>take a year period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's even better.</v>

2240
01:35:30.411 --> 01:35:35.411
<v Speaker 3>Here's even better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terry Edom versus Barboza Barboza we'll </v>

2241
01:35:35.411 --> 01:35:37.330
<v Speaker 3>carry Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the highest level of chaos.</v>

2242
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:40.490
<v Speaker 3>Go and take some time off to the highest</v>
<v Speaker 3>level of the rest of your life,</v>

2243
01:35:40.491 --> 01:35:41.720
<v Speaker 3>but either way it see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we say,</v>

2244
01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:42.980
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just got his bell rung.</v>

2245
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:46.100
<v Speaker 3>That's a bring trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's levels.</v>

2246
01:35:46.101 --> 01:35:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's the UFC $200 for what?</v>

2247
01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:52.820
<v Speaker 3>For what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not do another day?</v>

2248
01:35:54.370 --> 01:35:56.660
<v Speaker 3>He's going to get paper no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also also,</v>

2249
01:35:56.661 --> 01:35:59.810
<v Speaker 3>how long has your career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just injuries and stuff.</v>

2250
01:35:59.811 --> 01:36:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2251
01:36:01.190 --> 01:36:06.190
<v Speaker 3>We need to look at Chad Mendez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chad Mendez goes and getting stopped by </v>

2252
01:36:06.190 --> 01:36:08.690
<v Speaker 3>connor and then immediately gets knocked</v>
<v Speaker 3>out with one punch by Frankie and showed</v>

2253
01:36:08.691 --> 01:36:10.460
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's not normal for him.</v>

2254
01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:12.470
<v Speaker 3>Usually he can take a really good shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>

2255
01:36:12.471 --> 01:36:14.870
<v Speaker 3>So he goes from that to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now was the.</v>

2256
01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:19.900
<v Speaker 3>When was the Ricardo Lamas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fight was before the conor fight right </v>

2257
01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:20.180
<v Speaker 3>before color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he fights Ricardo Lamas,</v>

2258
01:36:20.181 --> 01:36:22.070
<v Speaker 3>dust him with one punch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurts them,</v>

2259
01:36:22.071 --> 01:36:23.570
<v Speaker 3>at least with one person that puts them </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

2260
01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:26.060
<v Speaker 3>Flights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Connor loses that fight,</v>

2261
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:28.420
<v Speaker 3>get stopped and gets really rocked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kinda hits them.</v>

2262
01:36:28.421 --> 01:36:30.390
<v Speaker 3>It's a big lift and knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he kind of just.</v>

2263
01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:33.020
<v Speaker 3>He was so tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he got,</v>

2264
01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:38.080
<v Speaker 3>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got 10 percent and then frankie just </v>

2265
01:36:38.091 --> 01:36:43.091
<v Speaker 3>takes them out with one left hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking New Jersey son Tom Connors camp.</v>

2266
01:36:45.741 --> 01:36:47.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm losing sleep over that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frankie Edgar.</v>

2267
01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Mind he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>best match up if he loses to Frankie.</v>

2268
01:36:53.150 --> 01:36:54.560
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where does connor,</v>

2269
01:36:54.561 --> 01:36:58.310
<v Speaker 3>what happens to conor at that point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real good question.</v>

2270
01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:00.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he loses the Frankie,</v>

2271
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:03.050
<v Speaker 3>he's got a really figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>regroup.</v>

2272
01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:08.140
<v Speaker 3>It depends on how Frankie beats him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Frankie takes him down and beat the </v>

2273
01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:08.810
<v Speaker 3>fuck out of them on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we've got,</v>

2274
01:37:08.850 --> 01:37:11.780
<v Speaker 3>he's got a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is a lot of sense.</v>

2275
01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:12.560
<v Speaker 3>How you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2276
01:37:12.561 --> 01:37:17.561
<v Speaker 3>that's the blueprint at Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's everyone knows that type </v>

2277
01:37:17.561 --> 01:37:18.080
<v Speaker 3>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone tries to do that.</v>

2278
01:37:18.090 --> 01:37:23.090
<v Speaker 3>Then they get fucking knocked out where </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows everyone in this entire </v>

2279
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:26.711
<v Speaker 3>world knows connor's weak point is </v>
<v Speaker 3>grappling with arguments that he hasn't </v>

2280
01:37:26.711 --> 01:37:28.990
<v Speaker 3>seen a real grappler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's Chad Mendez except for just Chad.</v>

2281
01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:32.210
<v Speaker 3>Just go for one round Duffy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was the guy who beat him,</v>

2282
01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:33.840
<v Speaker 3>beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Duffy arm triangle though.</v>

2283
01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:38.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm saying is that I'm telling </v>

2284
01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:38.860
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying nothing new.</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2287
01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:41.980
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that when you see what's</v>

2288
01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.580
<v Speaker 3>happening in the news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you see,</v>

2289
01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.470
<v Speaker 3>which did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fingers ready.</v>

2290
01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:50.500
<v Speaker 3>Brendan's a bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brendan's broken down.</v>

2291
01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:52.730
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2292
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:54.830
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not what this is about.</v>

2293
01:37:54.850 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Pride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just hear me</v>

2294
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.690
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to take some pain from this.</v>

2295
01:37:57.930 --> 01:38:01.840
<v Speaker 4>No one's ever heard this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if he brands fight conor?</v>

2296
01:38:03.970 --> 01:38:05.230
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hear me out.</v>

2297
01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:07.770
<v Speaker 4>I know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if I said it when his head is.</v>

2298
01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:10.650
<v Speaker 4>If you could just get away with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All you have to do is stay away from his</v>

2299
01:38:10.651 --> 01:38:11.610
<v Speaker 4>left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the game.</v>

2300
01:38:12.530 --> 01:38:14.190
<v Speaker 4>Not True because he kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

2301
01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:16.790
<v Speaker 4>Connor's got his right hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing to.</v>

2302
01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.440
<v Speaker 4>Did you say kicks our rice kicking?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't do a thing tonight.</v>

2303
01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.060
<v Speaker 4>That Nate Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2304
01:38:21.061 --> 01:38:24.080
<v Speaker 4>Yes it did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He like kicks.</v>

2305
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:29.390
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't throw his kicks are like the </v>

2306
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.390
<v Speaker 4>Sanchez is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not like.</v>

2307
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:32.090
<v Speaker 4>You can't say he's a different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicking in the door.</v>

2308
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:37.310
<v Speaker 4>I can't entertain this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it counts as his kicks </v>

2309
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.310
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2310
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:40.040
<v Speaker 4>In comparison to a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that's not your own.</v>

2311
01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:42.570
<v Speaker 4>When you fight conor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're more worried about his lefthand.</v>

2312
01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:44.430
<v Speaker 4>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not worried about getting knocked</v>

2313
01:38:44.431 --> 01:38:45.120
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like holly,</v>

2314
01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:50.300
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be careful of that round house you're </v>

2315
01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:52.221
<v Speaker 4>going to get knocked out with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does not just watch out for those leg </v>

2316
01:38:52.221 --> 01:38:52.221
<v Speaker 4>kicks with all the watch over the leg </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicks with connor.</v>

2317
01:38:52.221 --> 01:38:54.120
<v Speaker 4>You're saying stay away from that left </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand.</v>

2318
01:38:54.150 --> 01:38:55.890
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let me tell you something.</v>

2319
01:38:55.891 --> 01:38:58.200
<v Speaker 4>If he kicked you in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can knock you out that way too and he</v>

2320
01:38:58.201 --> 01:38:59.610
<v Speaker 4>can kick in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he hasn't done it.</v>

2321
01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:01.620
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got.</v>

2322
01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:05.310
<v Speaker 4>He's got a lethal lefthand for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I watched him throw kicks,</v>

2323
01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:07.680
<v Speaker 4>we're closer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it throws a lot of kicks,</v>

2324
01:39:07.681 --> 01:39:08.940
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He throws a lot of kicks in.</v>

2325
01:39:08.941 --> 01:39:12.270
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times what he's doing and she's</v>
<v Speaker 4>throwing almost disdainful kicks setting</v>

2326
01:39:12.271 --> 01:39:12.600
<v Speaker 4>you up.</v>

2327
01:39:12.650 --> 01:39:13.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's relaxed with them.</v>

2328
01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:16.080
<v Speaker 4>He's just throwing them in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just throws them in there.</v>

2329
01:39:16.081 --> 01:39:21.081
<v Speaker 4>He's not like fucking written down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>digging in and Barboza grits down.</v>

2330
01:39:21.871 --> 01:39:23.240
<v Speaker 4>Dig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what I'm saying though,</v>

2331
01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:26.760
<v Speaker 4>is that the kicks themselves might be </v>
<v Speaker 4>there as a distraction,</v>

2332
01:39:26.761 --> 01:39:28.950
<v Speaker 4>but you're not going to have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like your coach says,</v>

2333
01:39:28.951 --> 01:39:30.540
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those kicks are going to knock you out.</v>

2334
01:39:30.541 --> 01:39:33.030
<v Speaker 4>Whereas Barbosa of the Chad Mendez </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

2335
01:39:33.031 --> 01:39:34.950
<v Speaker 4>because he fucked Chad up with kicks to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the body.</v>

2336
01:39:35.370 --> 01:39:38.340
<v Speaker 4>He hits with a heart spinning back kick </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the body front,</v>

2337
01:39:38.341 --> 01:39:40.310
<v Speaker 4>kicked him the body a gang of times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2338
01:39:40.710 --> 01:39:45.710
<v Speaker 4>I think he's got a lot of tools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just does he have real world class </v>

2339
01:39:46.021 --> 01:39:48.870
<v Speaker 4>tools?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like here's the most world class striker</v>

2340
01:39:48.871 --> 01:39:51.140
<v Speaker 4>right now in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wonderboy,</v>

2341
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:52.900

<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2342
01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:56.280
<v Speaker 4>Most dynamic and exciting striker in </v>
<v Speaker 4>mma,</v>

2343
01:39:57.030 --> 01:40:02.030
<v Speaker 4>what he's doing is he's sport karate but</v>
<v Speaker 4>Moitai skills and wrestling,</v>

2344
01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:07.940
<v Speaker 4>takedown defense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that combination is fucking </v>

2345
01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:07.940
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous and answer just me.</v>

2346
01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:09.810
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fighting him.</v>

2347
01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:14.820
<v Speaker 4>Fight his hands down and can't find a a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't find a sparring partner.</v>

2348
01:40:14.851 --> 01:40:16.660
<v Speaker 4>The match him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He was 57 and.</v>

2350
01:40:18.741 --> 01:40:20.610
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was seven.</v>

2351
01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:21.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

2352
01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:23.100
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's crazy?</v>

2353
01:40:23.101 --> 01:40:26.550
<v Speaker 4>How crazy is mma where connor loses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda loses.</v>

2354
01:40:26.551 --> 01:40:31.551
<v Speaker 4>Holly loses like you can't predict it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone except for that bad </v>

2355
01:40:31.551 --> 01:40:33.000
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pound for pound number one.</v>

2356
01:40:33.150 --> 01:40:34.190
<v Speaker 4>Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was gonna.</v>

2357
01:40:34.210 --> 01:40:35.670
<v Speaker 4>Say Demetrius mighty mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnson.</v>

2358
01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:37.380
<v Speaker 4>Now he's lost though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about that,</v>

2359
01:40:37.381 --> 01:40:42.381
<v Speaker 4>but he hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hasn't lost since he fought dominick </v>

2360
01:40:42.381 --> 01:40:42.381
<v Speaker 4>Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lost a decision to dominick.</v>

2361
01:40:42.381 --> 01:40:47.361
<v Speaker 4>Cruz still lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying the guy who has John </v>

2362
01:40:47.361 --> 01:40:47.361
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even close.</v>

2363
01:40:47.361 --> 01:40:50.810
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Jones hasn't been well Gustafson </v>

2364
01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:53.410
<v Speaker 4>one fucking train for two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to see him in rumble.</v>

2365
01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

2366
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Me To kind of wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if he fights with Rambo,</v>

2367
01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:01.420
<v Speaker 3>I think you'll see John John's take </v>
<v Speaker 3>rumble down maybe second round.</v>

2368
01:41:01.450 --> 01:41:04.980
<v Speaker 3>Take them down first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the good about John is John could</v>

2369
01:41:04.981 --> 01:41:07.360
<v Speaker 3>be the nail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not just the hammer.</v>

2370
01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:12.420
<v Speaker 3>He can be the nail and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that's really scary about him </v>

2371
01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:15.300
<v Speaker 3>because he's so fucking talented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he still can take a beating and he </v>

2372
01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:18.751
<v Speaker 3>does not give up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got his arm basically snapped </v>

2373
01:41:18.751 --> 01:41:19.960
<v Speaker 3>backwards by Vito Belfort and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>submitted Vittorio later in the fight.</v>

2374
01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:24.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tore his entire body on him.</v>

2375
01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:29.820
<v Speaker 3>He fought shale son and beat the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of him and he being the fuck out of </v>

2376
01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:30.160
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He broke his toe sideways,</v>

2377
01:41:30.161 --> 01:41:35.161
<v Speaker 3>twisted it around backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't even realize it until we </v>

2378
01:41:35.161 --> 01:41:38.551
<v Speaker 3>were talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't even realize until he had his </v>

2379
01:41:38.551 --> 01:41:41.401
<v Speaker 3>belt on and he looks down in the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 3>of his big toe is facing up.</v>

2380
01:41:41.710 --> 01:41:43.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>If he is super dedicated,</v>

2395
01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:13.480
<v Speaker 3>even more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck.</v>

2396
01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:14.380
<v Speaker 3>Beaten up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully.</v>

2397
01:42:14.381 --> 01:42:17.440
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you need that wildcard for </v>
<v Speaker 3>greatness.</v>

2398
01:42:17.441 --> 01:42:18.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to be a little crazy.</v>

2399
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:20.350
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that.</v>

2400
01:42:20.351 --> 01:42:25.351
<v Speaker 3>He's a wild motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want my champion a couple of lines </v>

2401
01:42:25.351 --> 01:42:27.961
<v Speaker 3>here and my chicken continent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude prostitutes when you did that </v>

2402
01:42:27.961 --> 01:42:30.100
<v Speaker 3>interview with him and Daniel Cormier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in the middle.</v>

2403
01:42:30.670 --> 01:42:32.280
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I the,</v>

2404
01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:33.730
<v Speaker 3>the look and Jon Jones.</v>

2405
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:36.190
<v Speaker 3>He's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2406
01:42:36.191 --> 01:42:38.840
<v Speaker 3>So what happened when the camera wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>rolling,</v>

2407
01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:41.780
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't talk to each other before </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they.</v>

2408
01:42:41.781 --> 01:42:46.781
<v Speaker 3>And afterwards John was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were talking mad shit on the way </v>

2409
01:42:46.781 --> 01:42:50.551
<v Speaker 3>out in the parking lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't witness that so I can't </v>

2410
01:42:50.551 --> 01:42:50.551
<v Speaker 3>really speak on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But before it,</v>

2411
01:42:50.551 --> 01:42:52.180
<v Speaker 3>like I had a conversation with Danielle </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

2412
01:42:52.181 --> 01:42:55.480
<v Speaker 3>It's separately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a quick conversation with John before it</v>

2413
01:42:55.481 --> 01:42:57.760
<v Speaker 3>separately just saying what's up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's everything,</v>

2414
01:42:57.761 --> 01:42:59.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just Chit Chat and um,</v>

2415
01:43:00.650 --> 01:43:01.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing how,</v>

2416
01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:02.840
<v Speaker 3>how he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2417
01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:05.800
<v Speaker 3>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's fucking terrifying man.</v>

2418
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:08.110
<v Speaker 3>He's when he's focused,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the shit.</v>

2419
01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Some of the shit that he was saying that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daniel was like,</v>

2420
01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:11.370
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2421
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:14.620
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daniel's problem is I'm the Alpha and he</v>

2422
01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:19.621
<v Speaker 3>wants to be the Alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he knows he's always going to be my </v>

2423
01:43:19.621 --> 01:43:19.621
<v Speaker 3>pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2424
01:43:19.621 --> 01:43:19.621
<v Speaker 3>you're always going to be my pussy.</v>

2425
01:43:19.621 --> 01:43:21.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kelly did it.</v>

2426
01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:24.330
<v Speaker 3>They didn't put that just alpha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took off the pussy.</v>

2427
01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:27.070
<v Speaker 3>I each other you can see that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

2428
01:43:27.071 --> 01:43:30.370
<v Speaker 3>they should leave and I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a mistake.</v>

2429
01:43:30.371 --> 01:43:35.371
<v Speaker 3>Did she leave that in saying what Jon </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones to go full fucking Batman Joker.</v>

2430
01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Just be the heel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dartmouth.</v>

2431
01:43:37.630 --> 01:43:40.390
<v Speaker 3>Daniel was pretty intense to man when </v>
<v Speaker 3>Daniel was looking at him.</v>

2432
01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:42.990
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes fighters will say things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

2433
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.500
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't really believe that,</v>

2434
01:43:44.501 --> 01:43:46.510
<v Speaker 3>but he's saying that Daniel was telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2435
01:43:46.630 --> 01:43:50.650
<v Speaker 3>I am going to do everything in my power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to die to beat you.</v>

2436
01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:52.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John say goes.</v>

2437
01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:54.200
<v Speaker 3>You better be willing to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom.</v>

2438
01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:57.560
<v Speaker 3>Tom Wasn't shaken by it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Daniel was super emotional.</v>

2439
01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:58.700
<v Speaker 3>It was intense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2440
01:43:58.970 --> 01:43:59.870
<v Speaker 3>It was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

2441
01:43:59.871 --> 01:44:03.800
<v Speaker 3>really excited for that fight.</v>

2442
01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:05.000
<v Speaker 3>April.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited for that fight.</v>

2443
01:44:05.001 --> 01:44:06.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it changes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm excited for it.</v>

2444
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:09.050
<v Speaker 3>You want to come?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When is it?</v>

2445
01:44:09.051 --> 01:44:11.750

<v Speaker 3>Deniro.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We have no idea.</v>

2460
01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:42.900
<v Speaker 3>He just seen me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

2461
01:44:43.150 --> 01:44:48.150
<v Speaker 3>Dana white onto the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you do for the UFC by talking about</v>

2462
01:44:48.711 --> 01:44:50.300
<v Speaker 3>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hypes up fights.</v>

2463
01:44:50.301 --> 01:44:50.960
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2464
01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:56.200
<v Speaker 3>you to let you gotta let it a little be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit looser because you're </v>

2465
01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:59.831
<v Speaker 3>dealing with 500 different fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's hundreds of potential </v>

2466
01:44:59.931 --> 01:45:02.840
<v Speaker 3>matchups and maybe thousands if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>count them all up.</v>

2467
01:45:02.841 --> 01:45:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2468
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:06.920
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of disagreement is a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of debate,</v>

2469
01:45:06.921 --> 01:45:10.600
<v Speaker 3>but what you guys do with the fighter </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the kid going to get podcasts for or</v>

2470
01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:16.240
<v Speaker 3>FTC Kay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2471
01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:22.070
<v Speaker 3>from my tour schedule guys do is you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you create interest,</v>

2472
01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:24.230
<v Speaker 3>you get people excited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you discuss things.</v>

2473
01:45:24.230 --> 01:45:25.340
<v Speaker 3>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's entertaining.</v>

2474
01:45:25.341 --> 01:45:26.350
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

2475
01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:29.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like who pays our bills?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the UFC.</v>

2476
01:45:29.301 --> 01:45:31.370
<v Speaker 3>I can say whatever I want to realist </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2477
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:36.490
<v Speaker 3>Fox doesn't pay my bills so I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no fucking regulator on it and </v>

2478
01:45:36.490 --> 01:45:38.870
<v Speaker 3>you're fair and it's rare really </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>

2479
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:42.950
<v Speaker 3>Well I think that what you guys do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>valuable though.</v>

2480
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:46.490
<v Speaker 3>It's what I was trying to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's worth a lot like they can't.</v>

2481
01:45:46.491 --> 01:45:51.491
<v Speaker 3>You can't always control the message </v>
<v Speaker 3>that comes out when it comes to </v>

2482
01:45:51.491 --> 01:45:54.560
<v Speaker 3>something as exciting and dynamic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>multifaceted as MMA fights.</v>

2483
01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:59.720
<v Speaker 3>It was just too much shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when it comes to things like </v>

2484
01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.100
<v Speaker 3>controversial things like the reebok </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal or you know,</v>

2485
01:46:01.101 --> 01:46:01.610
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

2486
01:46:01.611 --> 01:46:06.611
<v Speaker 3>any other kind of a sponsored situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>or anything along those lines where </v>

2487
01:46:06.611 --> 01:46:10.361
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of disagreement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta you gotTa Kinda like let all </v>

2488
01:46:10.361 --> 01:46:10.361
<v Speaker 3>that play out.</v>

2489
01:46:10.361 --> 01:46:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Like if you don't let all that play out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're dealing with like a super </v>

2490
01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:18.011
<v Speaker 3>dynamic sport and there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>different areas to explore in all those </v>

2491
01:46:18.011 --> 01:46:18.500
<v Speaker 3>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Create interest.</v>

2492
01:46:18.650 --> 01:46:20.540
<v Speaker 3>And I think by limiting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>

2493
01:46:20.570 --> 01:46:25.570
<v Speaker 3>what you do is you limit the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest because there's going to be </v>

2494
01:46:25.570 --> 01:46:29.171
<v Speaker 3>disagreements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be people that are pro </v>

2495
01:46:29.171 --> 01:46:31.061
<v Speaker 3>this and pro that pro her at pro him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you got a guy like you is </v>

2496
01:46:31.341 --> 01:46:33.800
<v Speaker 3>controversial and it says a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit,</v>

2497
01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:39.010
<v Speaker 3>like all that does is like blossom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at the end of the day you're not a </v>

2498
01:46:39.010 --> 01:46:39.010
<v Speaker 3>bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like mma,</v>

2499
01:46:39.010 --> 01:46:40.220
<v Speaker 3>you love the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2500
01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:45.280
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're genuinely intrigued about these </v>

2501
01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:48.190
<v Speaker 3>ups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have a controversial point of </v>

2502
01:46:48.190 --> 01:46:48.190
<v Speaker 3>view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that shouldn't be silenced.</v>

2503
01:46:48.190 --> 01:46:48.290
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also that,</v>

2504
01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:50.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the reebok deal</v>

2505
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:52.390
<v Speaker 1>or any of these match ups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it when you turn on you,</v>

2506
01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:54.840
<v Speaker 1>it lets you watch UFC tonight who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying their bills.</v>

2507
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:57.990
<v Speaker 1>These guys can't be real dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fighters with the Reebok,</v>

2512
01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:07.380
<v Speaker 1>censoring so I can stay out is like go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a hater.</v>

2513
01:47:07.381 --> 01:47:12.381
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a hater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the first guys that they </v>

2514
01:47:12.381 --> 01:47:12.450
<v Speaker 1>can't do anything to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's really nothing to do.</v>

2515

01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:22.590
<v Speaker 1>They did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just for the first time it was a</v>

2519
01:47:22.591 --> 01:47:26.130
<v Speaker 1>guy with a voice and no one reeboks not </v>

2525
01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:38.940

<v Speaker 1>If she choose who you communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his life and one of the things that's</v>

2549
01:48:38.191 --> 01:48:43.191
<v Speaker 1>good about criticism and online </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism as you can learn how other </v>

01:48:43.191 --> 01:48:43.191
<v Speaker 1>people view you and you can go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's kind of valid.</v>

2553
01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I came off Douchey or maybe I </v>
<v Speaker 1>should preface that better or maybe I </v>

2554
01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:53.801
<v Speaker 1>should explain myself better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you realize that some of the </v>

<v Speaker 1>Were you trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a message or you just trying</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something right because </v>

<v Speaker 1>Keeping on keeping on anybody.</v>

2573
01:49:32.551 --> 01:49:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Like look at Kanye West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a Kanye West Fan.</v>

2574
01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:39.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean see cut logs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Music is excellent just for this,</v>

2575
01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:43.320
<v Speaker 1>but I think is closer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous,</v>

2576
01:49:43.670 --> 01:49:48.670
<v Speaker 1>but the shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I love the fact that will tweet </v>

<v Speaker 1>dummies</v>

2578

<v Speaker 4>That's a master manipulator and a </v>

2581
01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:00.120
<v Speaker 4>marketing guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2582
01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:02.440
<v Speaker 4>I used to always go bad on Kanye and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I went out.</v>

2583
01:50:02.441 --> 01:50:05.200
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is this guy like everybody likes him</v>

2584
01:50:05.201 --> 01:50:07.000
<v Speaker 4>and I know people are very intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 4>and speak highly.</v>

2585
01:50:07.001 --> 01:50:10.340
<v Speaker 4>So I tend to look at this body of work </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you should just read.</v>

2586
01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:11.860
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well he,</v>

2587
01:50:12.650 --> 01:50:15.850
<v Speaker 4>I think I can take kind of wake county </v>
<v Speaker 4>down but what,</v>

2588
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:19.210
<v Speaker 4>what got to me and I was like this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>is produced a shitload of music and it's</v>

2589
01:50:19.211 --> 01:50:21.880
<v Speaker 4>all different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I went and bought every song.</v>

2590
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:26.410
<v Speaker 4>I bought every song he's ever done and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>spent three days listening to every song</v>

2591
01:50:26.650 --> 01:50:29.170
<v Speaker 4>like three times and I got the lyrics </v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2592
01:50:29.171 --> 01:50:29.860
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2593
01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:30.400
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2594
01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:35.460
<v Speaker 4>you cannot deny this guy is putting out </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy amounts of work and it's really </v>

2595
01:50:35.831 --> 01:50:36.130
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

2596
01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:43.080
<v Speaker 4>But then I started listening to </v>
<v Speaker 4>interviews that he was giving like long </v>

2597
01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:44.440
<v Speaker 4>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long form interviews and I have to say I</v>

2598
01:50:44.441 --> 01:50:46.810
<v Speaker 4>came full circle musical gene.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got.</v>

2599
01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:50.710
<v Speaker 4>But he's also got shit to say that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>agree with like I'm aligned with him.</v>

2600
01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:55.920
<v Speaker 4>I think he also trips over his own dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got arrogant outbursts and you can </v>

2601
01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:55.920
<v Speaker 4>relate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2602
01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:58.260

<v Speaker 4>up rich and no,</v>

2603
01:50:58.270 --> 01:51:03.270
<v Speaker 4>I can relate to an artist who says I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>not going to limit myself and I'm not </v>

2604
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:05.500
<v Speaker 4>going to censor myself and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>speak my mind because we live.</v>

2605
01:51:05.590 --> 01:51:07.600
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like people are crazy.</v>

2606
01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:12.740
<v Speaker 4>Is it just about your maybach and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>about your status or is it about </v>

2607
01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:12.740
<v Speaker 4>something else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2608
01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:14.320
<v Speaker 4>and he was very eloquent about how I </v>
<v Speaker 4>spoke.</v>

2609
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:19.470
<v Speaker 4>I love what he said on Jimmy Kimmel that</v>
<v Speaker 4>ranty had about being an artist either </v>

<v Speaker 4>a little private experiment,</v>

2676
01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:04.070
<v Speaker 4>I was looking at Audis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was looking at a tornado's I was going</v>

2677
01:54:04.071 --> 01:54:06.320
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alexis and I did a little thing.</v>

2678
01:54:06.321 --> 01:54:09.740
<v Speaker 4>It's a chauvinist thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've found that women saleswomen uh,</v>

2679
01:54:09.850 --> 01:54:11.900
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not up on the details like guys,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

2683
01:54:16.431 --> 01:54:18.530
<v Speaker 4>I found that women would usually go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2684
01:54:18.531 --> 01:54:19.490
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they knew the car,</v>

2685
01:54:19.491 --> 01:54:21.140
<v Speaker 4>but they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about the,</v>

2686
01:54:21.490 --> 01:54:23.120
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's something that I'd have to ask.</v>

2687
01:54:23.121 --> 01:54:26.430
<v Speaker 4>And they know that guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should definitely not.</v>

2688
01:54:26.490 --> 01:54:30.200
<v Speaker 4>I go in with all my research so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want this gap in my ear off.</v>

2689
01:54:30.201 --> 01:54:32.660
<v Speaker 4>I know what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I bought my Prius,</v>

2690
01:54:32.661 --> 01:54:34.850
<v Speaker 4>which the lease is up next month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank Baby Jesus.</v>

2691
01:54:35.090 --> 01:54:37.610
<v Speaker 4>I bought it just for kid because I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>driving all over California.</v>

2692
01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:39.020
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lease is up,</v>

2693
01:54:39.021 --> 01:54:41.240

<v Speaker 4>So you want to test drive it like,</v>

2696
01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:47.560
<v Speaker 4>block.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's depressing for gas mileage.</v>

2697
01:54:47.630 --> 01:54:48.650
<v Speaker 4>Then I got in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you would appreciate what one of those </v>

<v Speaker 1>roundhouse.</v>

02:02:23.530 --> 02:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>

2881
02:02:24.831 --> 02:02:26.120
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get enough of.</v>

2882
02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Is this kombucha drink three a day now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a problem?</v>

2883
02:02:28.810 --> 02:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love people think we're doing an ad.</v>

2884
02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Every time I do something on instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2885
02:02:34.090 --> 02:02:36.020
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking love kombucha,</v>

2886
02:02:36.230 --> 02:02:41.230
<v Speaker 1>but nOt the bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clear can has to be the black 21 and </v>

2887
02:02:41.230 --> 02:02:43.871
<v Speaker 1>over to let live on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explain that because people don't know </v>

2888
02:02:43.871 --> 02:02:43.871
<v Speaker 1>what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2889
02:02:43.871 --> 02:02:47.711
<v Speaker 1>the clear cam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they basIcally produced those so they </v>

2890
02:02:47.711 --> 02:02:47.870
<v Speaker 1>could sell in grocery stores because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no alcohol content in them.</v>

2891
02:02:47.930 --> 02:02:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Very little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very little.</v>

2892
02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:51.860
<v Speaker 1>So the black cans or they have more </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol content.</v>

2893
02:02:51.861 --> 02:02:54.220
<v Speaker 1>How they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the tea is naturally fermented.</v>

2894
02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:56.630
<v Speaker 1>So you want the black canvas is 21?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2895
02:02:56.690 --> 02:02:58.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not a black hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bottle.</v>

2896
02:02:58.461 --> 02:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>And the difference is the label cost </v>
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>

2897
02:03:00.710 --> 02:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just the plat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plastic rim around the bottle top </v>

2898
02:03:05.710 --> 02:03:06.470
<v Speaker 1>when you open it as black.</v>

2899
02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>But bro even the bottles are different </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the 21 million.</v>

2900
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>They're darker and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2901
02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:16.310
<v Speaker 1>It's something about the fermentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we have a knife that your samurai </v>

2902
02:03:17.181 --> 02:03:22.181
<v Speaker 1>sword over there from the 15 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and slice that thin real </v>

2903
02:03:23.001 --> 02:03:26.420
<v Speaker 1>samurai sword from the 15 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes it is.</v>

2904
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:30.810
<v Speaker 1>That is a real samurai swords.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it aba?</v>

2905
02:03:30.811 --> 02:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Gave it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it opened that bitch up?</v>

2906
02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:39.350
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like this is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your ball or friends,</v>

2907
02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of shit they give you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a.</v>

2908
02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:42.670
<v Speaker 1>This isn't 15 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

2909
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

2910
02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Shut your fucking pawn stars right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shattering.</v>

2911
02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much.</v>

2912
02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:57.280
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent real blade itself and </v>

2913
02:03:57.280 --> 02:03:57.470
<v Speaker 1>telling me that shit was 49,</v>
<v Speaker 1>99 bright.</v>

2914
02:03:58.070 --> 02:04:00.380
<v Speaker 1>They refurbished the handle and make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all perfect.</v>

2915
02:04:00.381 --> 02:04:05.381
<v Speaker 1>But that blade is from the 1500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing looks pretty fucking real.</v>

2916
02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:10.000
<v Speaker 1>That's real as fuck a glove and cut that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking sausage and stopped jacking off.</v>

2917
02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:13.220
<v Speaker 1>People have died by the sword.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good chance.</v>

2918
02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:14.850
<v Speaker 1>if it's that old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder mean,</v>

2919
02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:16.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about all the samurai sorts</v>

2920
02:04:16.611 --> 02:04:21.611
<v Speaker 1>in the $1,500,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many hand in this continuous civil </v>

2921
02:04:21.611 --> 02:04:21.611
<v Speaker 1>war for about 300 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a good chance.</v>

2922
02:04:21.611 --> 02:04:23.330
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm thinking is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it like pistols?</v>

2923
02:04:23.331 --> 02:04:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Like most people who have pistols never </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed anybody.</v>

2924
02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:26.360
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2925
02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Like is that what it was like back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day with samurai swords or were they</v>

2926
02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>more liberal or gangster shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2927
02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:36.110
<v Speaker 1>probably take a little bit of that elk </v>
<v Speaker 1>son slice into that bitch.</v>

2928
02:04:36.111 --> 02:04:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

2929
02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:42.330
<v Speaker 1>the plastic is getting you take a piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate back to the kombucha though.</v>

2930
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:44.700
<v Speaker 1>People have tried telling me the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits are fake on that.</v>

2931
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Just so just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that good for you.</v>

2932
02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>It'S all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probiotic,</v>

2933
02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:54.620
<v Speaker 1>probiotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fermented vegetables and fermented </v>

2934
02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:57.450
<v Speaker 1>fermented mushrooms and things on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines,</v>

2935
02:04:57.451 --> 02:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially what kombucha is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fungus is very good for you.</v>

2936
02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:02.340
<v Speaker 1>It's very good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>people that run farms like nearby and </v>

2951
02:05:36.181 --> 02:05:38.490
<v Speaker 1>then they have their own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some spicy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's really good for you.</v>

2961
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gut health changes everything,</v>

2962
02:06:04.981 --> 02:06:09.981
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to some of my podcasts </v>

2963
02:06:09.981 --> 02:06:11.391
<v Speaker 1>I've done with rhonda patrick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes deep into gut health and how </v>

2964
02:06:11.391 --> 02:06:12.630
<v Speaker 1>important it is for all sorts of aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your personality,</v>

2965
02:06:12.631 --> 02:06:15.210
<v Speaker 1>the way you think about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2966
02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:16.680
<v Speaker 1>They did that with the rats where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave.</v>

2967
02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:19.890
<v Speaker 1>They've changed the gut health and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rat,</v>

2968
02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:24.920
<v Speaker 1>like the bacteria and some rats with </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy bacteria in their gut kept </v>

2969
02:06:25.321 --> 02:06:25.830
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

2970
02:06:26.410 --> 02:06:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess to get out of the water and </v>

2971
02:06:31.410 --> 02:06:34.191
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they change the bacteria in their </v>

2972
02:06:34.191 --> 02:06:34.191
<v Speaker 1>gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually changed the serotonin levels</v>

2973
02:06:34.191 --> 02:06:38.070
<v Speaker 1>in their brain because apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>serotonin is made in the gut as well.</v>

2974
02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:41.970
<v Speaker 1>And they just became listless and gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>up around.</v>

2975
02:06:42.150 --> 02:06:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had a bad call.</v>

2976
02:06:43.670 --> 02:06:48.670
<v Speaker 1>That bitch ass was stomach ache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can go swimming,</v>

2977
02:06:50.370 --> 02:06:52.410
<v Speaker 1>makes sure your gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your guts.</v>

2978
02:06:52.411 --> 02:06:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2979
02:06:53.041 --> 02:06:56.200
<v Speaker 1>and this is all this all came from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal that uh,</v>

2980
02:06:56.250 --> 02:06:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was there that you shot in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face and the body.</v>

2981
02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:02.670
<v Speaker 1>You're shooting in the face though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the phase is a good idea though.</v>

2982
02:07:02.730 --> 02:07:05.850
<v Speaker 1>That'd be if you don't do it because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2983
02:07:06.540 --> 02:07:09.300
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to be that accurate when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot a body,</v>

2984
02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in elk,</v>

2985
02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:15.030
<v Speaker 1>you have a giant target as much as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as you're practicing.</v>

2986
02:07:15.031 --> 02:07:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's sort of go over some head shots on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2987
02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:22.280
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to do it as taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No guys do it all the time with pigs.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's always been a pig murderer.</v>

3013
02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:17.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean he looked in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you live in Texas,</v>

02:08:17.681 --> 02:08:18.650
<v Speaker 3>you got to kill pigs.</v>

3015
02:08:18.650 --> 02:08:20.290
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to kill pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3016
02:08:20.410 --> 02:08:21.910
<v Speaker 3>You got to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all.</v>

3017
02:08:21.911 --> 02:08:25.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're massively invasive.</v>

3018
02:08:25.090 --> 02:08:30.090
<v Speaker 3>There's millions of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean fucking million just taking </v>

3019
02:08:30.090 --> 02:08:31.480
<v Speaker 3>machine data alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In Texas alone,</v>

3020
02:08:31.481 --> 02:08:33.480
<v Speaker 3>there are millions of wild hogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3021
02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:35.890
<v Speaker 3>it's so bad that Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they opened up a road.</v>

3022
02:08:36.130 --> 02:08:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Have they had built a new road and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>night they open it up,</v>

3023
02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:41.620
<v Speaker 3>they got liKe 40 car accidents where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were slamming into pigs.</v>

3024
02:08:41.621 --> 02:08:42.820
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tim kennedy taught me this.</v>

3025
02:08:42.821 --> 02:08:44.380
<v Speaker 3>He said in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pigs are real.</v>

3026
02:08:44.381 --> 02:08:46.660
<v Speaker 3>He gets on horseback and hudson was </v>
<v Speaker 3>spear.</v>

3027
02:08:46.661 --> 02:08:51.661
<v Speaker 3>how about the fact that with fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopters wanted to see something </v>

3028
02:08:51.661 --> 02:08:55.741
<v Speaker 3>crazy west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This pull up pigman and ted nugent hunt </v>

3029
02:08:55.741 --> 02:08:59.920
<v Speaker 3>pigs with a helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have episodes they call a pork lips</v>

3030
02:08:59.921 --> 02:09:04.921
<v Speaker 3>now and they fucking fly around </v>
<v Speaker 3>attendance outside hunting.</v>

3031
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:07.300
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3032
02:09:07.301 --> 02:09:08.930
<v Speaker 3>it's massacre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead,</v>

3033
02:09:09.010 --> 02:09:10.150
<v Speaker 3>it should be illegal not to do.</v>

3034
02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:11.380
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3035
02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:13.720
<v Speaker 3>it's a massacre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what they have to do.</v>

3036
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:14.380
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3037
02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:16.870
<v Speaker 3>there are things that you have to do if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to,</v>

3038
02:09:16.871 --> 02:09:20.410
<v Speaker 3>if everybody has this idea that nature </v>
<v Speaker 3>balances itself out,</v>

3039
02:09:20.411 --> 02:09:25.411
<v Speaker 3>but the problem with that idea is in 90 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of everything that's ever </v>

3040
02:09:25.411 --> 02:09:25.570
<v Speaker 3>existed ever is extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety percent.</v>

3041
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:29.950
<v Speaker 3>So all of those fucking animals that </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't helped along,</v>

3042
02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:31.780
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3043
02:09:31.870 --> 02:09:36.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real big problem with bears </v>

3044
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:39.580
<v Speaker 3>and deer and moose populations because </v>
<v Speaker 3>bear and wolves,</v>

3045
02:09:39.581 --> 02:09:44.581
<v Speaker 3>especially to now in the places where </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves have been reintroduced because </v>

3046
02:09:44.581 --> 02:09:45.340
<v Speaker 3>wolves give birth to a litter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3047
02:09:45.341 --> 02:09:47.550
<v Speaker 3>So if a wolf pop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3048
02:09:47.590 --> 02:09:52.570
<v Speaker 3>if a wolf mom has like six babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a moose only has one baby.</v>

3049
02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:57.840
<v Speaker 3>So the moose has one baby and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this fucking wolf running around</v>

3050
02:09:58.181 --> 02:10:00.940
<v Speaker 3>with six pups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the just do the math,</v>

3051
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:02.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna,</v>

3052
02:10:02.110 --> 02:10:05.800
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna slowly but surely start </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking out all of the,</v>

3053
02:10:05.801 --> 02:10:07.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the game animals.</v>

3054
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:12.030
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's happening in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>states where they've reintroduced wolf </v>

3055
02:10:13.061 --> 02:10:14.430
<v Speaker 3>hunting too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of states now.</v>

3056
02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:15.490
<v Speaker 3>And bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3057
02:10:15.491 --> 02:10:16.890
<v Speaker 3>bears have always been hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

3058
02:10:16.930 --> 02:10:19.360
<v Speaker 3>You have to have like a knife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kodiak bears,</v>

3059
02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:24.900
<v Speaker 3>mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to hunt things that don't have </v>

3060
02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:24.900
<v Speaker 3>a predator because if they don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>predator,</v>

3061
02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:26.060
<v Speaker 3>the nothing controls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're popular.</v>

3062
02:10:26.061 --> 02:10:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Great white sharks or what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3063
02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:29.680
<v Speaker 3>great white sharks try to hit those next</v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

3064
02:10:29.690 --> 02:10:30.950
<v Speaker 3>They clean shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

3065
02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:32.120
<v Speaker 3>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hang that,</v>

3066
02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:34.430
<v Speaker 3>but that's what that says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If an ad,</v>

3067
02:10:34.490 --> 02:10:38.210
<v Speaker 3>there's actual episodes where you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>see going down these little pigs.</v>

3068
02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:40.060
<v Speaker 3>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a pork.</v>

3069
02:10:40.061 --> 02:10:42.880

<v Speaker 3>they kill everything on the pork lips </v>

3071
02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:50.411
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they Just leave to point being this </v>

3072
02:10:50.411 --> 02:10:54.251
<v Speaker 3>guy's dad pigments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad shoots pigs in the head all the </v>

3073
02:10:54.251 --> 02:10:54.251
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

3074

3075
02:10:55.670 --> 02:11:00.410
<v Speaker 3>What he does is he'll line corn up on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the road like a row of corn,</v>

3076
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:05.470
<v Speaker 3>like maybe like several yards long and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they get down there because it's a </v>

3077
02:11:05.470 --> 02:11:09.731
<v Speaker 3>line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get down there to eat in the line </v>

3078
02:11:09.731 --> 02:11:10.840
<v Speaker 3>and then he gets their heads lined up so</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it gets to the headline deaf,</v>

3079
02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:15.860
<v Speaker 3>he'll shoot through three of them with </v>
<v Speaker 3>one bullet and he's always trying to </v>

3080
02:11:15.860 --> 02:11:18.941
<v Speaker 3>kill as many pigs as he can with one </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet to the head and it's crazy but </v>

3081
02:11:20.050 --> 02:11:22.850
<v Speaker 3>it's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But theY do have to kill these things.</v>

3082
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:23.780
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3083
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:25.760
<v Speaker 3>if you can kill one by shooting in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>

3084
02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:27.830
<v Speaker 3>that is the best way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some people like,</v>

3085
02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:29.180
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sHouldn't do it,</v>

3086
02:11:29.181 --> 02:11:30.020
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't kill.</v>

3087
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3088
02:11:30.740 --> 02:11:31.940
<v Speaker 3>well then they're going to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

3089
02:11:32.030 --> 02:11:33.830
<v Speaker 3>They're going to eat all the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>nesting birds.</v>

3090
02:11:33.831 --> 02:11:35.660
<v Speaker 3>When you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

3091
02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:40.400
<v Speaker 3>jane would google how many pigs we </v>
<v Speaker 3>slaughter a day in this country.</v>

3092
02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:43.640
<v Speaker 3>That number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about domestic.</v>

3093
02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:49.190
<v Speaker 3>That's avoidable because you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have farming,</v>

3094
02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:54.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have factory farm and </v>

3095
02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:54.220
<v Speaker 3>you to feed that many people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do.</v>

3096
02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:55.850
<v Speaker 3>My point is that we're talking about two</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely different issues.</v>

3097
02:11:55.851 --> 02:12:00.650
<v Speaker 3>My point is if you let these wild hogs </v>
<v Speaker 3>go nuts and just keep breeding,</v>

3098
02:12:00.890 --> 02:12:04.520
<v Speaker 3>they're having three litters a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes really bad.</v>

3099
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:07.640
<v Speaker 3>And each one of them is like six to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight fucking babies.</v>

3100
02:12:07.670 --> 02:12:11.630
<v Speaker 3>500 hogs and pigs and they run fast for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fastest shit.</v>

3101
02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:13.010
<v Speaker 3>And they know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

3102
02:12:13.011 --> 02:12:14.250
<v Speaker 3>They're smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3103
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:15.440
<v Speaker 3>They're here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These pop pop,</v>

3104
02:12:15.441 --> 02:12:17.000
<v Speaker 3>pop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they watched their friends explode.</v>

3105
02:12:17.001 --> 02:12:18.860
<v Speaker 3>They're not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

3106
02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:21.980
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know doug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very smart.</v>

3107
02:12:22.250 --> 02:12:24.620
<v Speaker 3>They're very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends on who's run though.</v>

3108
02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:27.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm impressed with how fast they run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a wild animal,</v>

3109
02:12:27.321 --> 02:12:27.800
<v Speaker 3>brian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3110
02:12:28.150 --> 02:12:29.690
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's terrified for his life,</v>

3111
02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:32.630
<v Speaker 3>but the question is if you don't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3112
02:12:32.631 --> 02:12:34.190
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't shoot them,</v>

3113
02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:35.840
<v Speaker 3>what do you do?</v>

3114
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:38.390
<v Speaker 3>Do you just let them like what is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegan response?</v>

3115
02:12:38.391 --> 02:12:40.940
<v Speaker 3>What is the animal rights response?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Build a wall for him.</v>

3116
02:12:41.250 --> 02:12:42.380
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to can't.</v>

3117
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:44.540
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't have a white one.</v>

3118
02:12:44.541 --> 02:12:46.280
<v Speaker 3>You son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3119
02:12:46.281 --> 02:12:49.040
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are domestic pigs that get loose.</v>

3120
02:12:49.070 --> 02:12:51.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm so impressed with how fast they run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They bound.</v>

3121
02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fast as fuck.</v>

3122
02:12:53.090 --> 02:12:54.860
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this ain't easy to hit these fuckers.</v>

3123
02:12:54.861 --> 02:12:57.560
<v Speaker 3>I love how they run and zigzag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3124
02:12:57.590 --> 02:12:58.730
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're smart.</v>

3125
02:12:59.110 --> 02:13:00.560
<v Speaker 3>They're trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good shot though.</v>

3126
02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:02.250
<v Speaker 3>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a magnet.</v>

3127
02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>WeLl you definitely have to be a good </v>

3128
02:13:07.300 --> 02:13:07.300
<v Speaker 3>shot.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean guys miss on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the halo is a killer.</v>

3130
02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:10.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>For real.</v>

3131
02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:13.100
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it'd be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call of duty and shit.</v>

3132
02:13:13.101 --> 02:13:13.850
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who did?</v>

3133
02:13:13.851 --> 02:13:18.851
<v Speaker 3>They have kids now who are 16 years old </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they've been playing for the </v>

3134
02:13:18.851 --> 02:13:19.130
<v Speaker 3>against and there were three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You give them a couple of adjustments.</v>

3135
02:13:19.131 --> 02:13:20.720
<v Speaker 3>They're shooting as well as they swat </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

3136
02:13:21.370 --> 02:13:26.370
<v Speaker 3>They get used to pulling triggers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those first person shooter as a </v>

3137
02:13:26.370 --> 02:13:29.930
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these fucks when they go into the </v>

3138
02:13:29.930 --> 02:13:30.050
<v Speaker 3>theater shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll fucking practice on the kids who</v>

3139
02:13:30.051 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 3>are expert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get used</v>

3140
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:34.950
<v Speaker 1>to Leading to get used to doing all </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of different things.</v>

3141
02:13:34.970 --> 02:13:37.020
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one kid was 16 and he was hitting.</v>

3142
02:13:37.021 --> 02:13:38.490
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was headshots bang,</v>

3143
02:13:38.491 --> 02:13:38.780
<v Speaker 1>bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bang,</v>

3144
02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:39.970
<v Speaker 1>bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they.</v>

3145
02:13:40.030 --> 02:13:41.700
<v Speaker 1>At first it was kind of missing a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>knick game,</v>

3146
02:13:41.701 --> 02:13:45.780
<v Speaker 1>a couple of adjustments because it was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real gun and then in an afternoon he was</v>

3147
02:13:45.781 --> 02:13:48.240
<v Speaker 1>shooting as well as the expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The expert marksman.</v>

3148
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Kids play a little too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>video games he'd been playing since he </v>

3149
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.510
<v Speaker 1>was three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>

3150
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:54.450
<v Speaker 1>He was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so insane.</v>

3151
02:13:54.451 --> 02:13:58.320
<v Speaker 1>If you think about how what they can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>now in comparison,</v>

3152
02:13:58.330 --> 02:14:01.110
<v Speaker 1>like think about what they used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do 20 years ago,</v>

3153
02:14:01.230 --> 02:14:06.230
<v Speaker 1>what they can do now and then what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be able to do 20 years </v>

3154
02:14:06.230 --> 02:14:06.230
<v Speaker 1>video games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about controlled fighters.</v>

3155
02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Fighters are going to have like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to fight like a virtual reality,</v>

3156
02:14:09.871 --> 02:14:12.150
<v Speaker 1>kind of moving their head and seeing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shots come.</v>

3157
02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Here's one thing for sure is gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

3158
02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:16.800
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have some I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot type assassins.</v>

3159
02:14:17.140 --> 02:14:22.140
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to release those on </v>

3160
02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan and we're never going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have another casualty.</v>

3161
02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean if also going to release so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>

3162
02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suicide bombers now to fucking I robe.</v>

3163
02:14:28.801 --> 02:14:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Others walking down to the miami </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins stadium.</v>

3164
02:14:31.810 --> 02:14:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the worry.</v>

3165
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:37.080
<v Speaker 1>That one's for frisia chore ahead </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologically,</v>

3166
02:14:37.090 --> 02:14:40.250
<v Speaker 1>but for a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China begs to differ.</v>

3167
02:14:41.070 --> 02:14:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3168
02:14:42.101 --> 02:14:44.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to see that thing come from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile away thing.</v>

3169
02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:49.430
<v Speaker 1>I think the next generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing has a battery power on its </v>

3170
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:50.850
<v Speaker 1>back that it stole from a tesla and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>running around.</v>

3171
02:14:50.851 --> 02:14:53.280
<v Speaker 1>We'll go ahead and run behind that thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yanked the cord out.</v>

3172
02:14:53.310 --> 02:14:56.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to know you're running behind</v>

3173
02:14:56.251 --> 02:15:01.251
<v Speaker 1>it because it has cameras everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like a tesla looking just like a </v>

3174
02:15:01.251 --> 02:15:01.251
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>

3175
02:15:01.251 --> 02:15:02.100
<v Speaker 1>That's how tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is insane though.</v>

3176
02:15:02.101 --> 02:15:07.101
<v Speaker 1>This is weird to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this thing walking around what </v>

3177
02:15:07.101 --> 02:15:07.860

<v Speaker 1>fucking Bruce Lee kicking it fall over.</v>

3178
02:15:08.210 --> 02:15:10.920
<v Speaker 1>It can see you come and I would assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>it has cameras everywhere.</v>

3179
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you put cameras three and </v>
<v Speaker 1>an associate degrees on one of these </v>

3180
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:15.950
<v Speaker 1>fucking things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's picking up a box.</v>

3181

<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it bends over correctly.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel like you're being manipulated </v>

02:20:41.831 --> 02:20:42.260
<v Speaker 4>and demonized you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only that,</v>

<v Speaker 4>about to go.</v>

<v Speaker 4>But it's not real.</v>

3318
02:21:00.681 --> 02:21:03.290
<v Speaker 4>It's social virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's virtue signaling.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Michael shermer calls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But let me be devil's advocate for a </v>

3329

<v Speaker 4>see guys don't see gay.</v>

3331
02:21:34.370 --> 02:21:35.910
<v Speaker 4>You see women's clothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>men's clothing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm just so colorblind.</v>

3333
02:21:38.330 --> 02:21:39.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you guys or girls or </v>
<v Speaker 4>boys.</v>

3334
02:21:40.730 --> 02:21:44.090
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a front hole or front?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me check.</v>

<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

3336
02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:47.990
<v Speaker 4>what was I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something really profound,</v>

3337
02:21:47.991 --> 02:21:49.070
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is my thing.</v>

3338
02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:52.300
<v Speaker 4>Job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just while you're thinking,</v>

3339
02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:55.200
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what will we do?</v>

3340
02:21:55.201 --> 02:21:56.930
<v Speaker 4>I think you were getting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were saying that.</v>

3341
02:21:57.580 --> 02:22:02.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If someone says something there,</v>

3342
02:22:02.060 --> 02:22:05.090
<v Speaker 4>I do think that there is a place to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3343
02:22:05.091 --> 02:22:08.360
<v Speaker 4>if you are a victim out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a transgender kid and you were</v>

3344
02:22:08.361 --> 02:22:10.670
<v Speaker 4>thinking about killing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is value.</v>

3345
02:22:10.671 --> 02:22:12.890
<v Speaker 4>There's value to seeing really cool </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

3346
02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:15.500
<v Speaker 4>actors that you look up to saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey dude,</v>

3347
02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:20.620
<v Speaker 4>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not a freak or it's okay to be </v>

3348
02:22:20.620 --> 02:22:22.220
<v Speaker 4>who you are because that's the truth of </v>
<v Speaker 4>who you are and feel empowered.</v>

3349
02:22:22.221 --> 02:22:27.221
<v Speaker 4>Like I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait until it's no longer an </v>

3350
02:22:27.221 --> 02:22:27.221
<v Speaker 4>issue so then we can start</v>

3351
02:22:27.221 --> 02:22:29.820
<v Speaker 3>figuring out which one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>transgender people are just dummies that</v>

3352
02:22:29.821 --> 02:22:34.821
<v Speaker 3>happened to be transgender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>which one of these gay people are just </v>

3353
02:22:34.821 --> 02:22:37.700
<v Speaker 3>dummies and happened to be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of that where people </v>

3354
02:22:37.700 --> 02:22:38.730
<v Speaker 3>get free rides just because from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>marginalized group,</v>

3355
02:22:38.731 --> 02:22:41.910
<v Speaker 3>it's not just that they're annoying and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a part of this whole thing,</v>

3356
02:22:41.940 --> 02:22:45.960
<v Speaker 3>like a hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the real de is just coming from</v>

3357
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:48.440
<v Speaker 3>dummies that support a great cause and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they get.</v>

3358
02:22:48.450 --> 02:22:52.950
<v Speaker 3>They have a big problem with the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>social justice warrior movement is it?</v>

3359
02:22:52.951 --> 02:22:55.740
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is just really fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>socially,</v>

3360
02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:58.710
<v Speaker 3>socially retarded people and those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

3361
02:22:59.010 --> 02:23:02.250
<v Speaker 3>those people have found an area in which</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

3362
02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:07.280
<v Speaker 3>if you support this area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be the biggest con in the world </v>

3363
02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:11.450
<v Speaker 3>supporting that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could be fucking horrendous to </v>

3364
02:23:11.450 --> 02:23:11.490
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rude to people,</v>

3365
02:23:11.491 --> 02:23:15.270
<v Speaker 3>try to destroy people's lives as long as</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing within the confines and the</v>

3366
02:23:15.271 --> 02:23:20.271
<v Speaker 3>parameters of that cost and I don't buy </v>
<v Speaker 3>it because I think that those are just </v>

3367
02:23:20.271 --> 02:23:20.271
<v Speaker 3>terrible people.</v>

3368
02:23:20.271 --> 02:23:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Meeting those people are will people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that found a good cause to be specific?</v>

3369
02:23:23.940 --> 02:23:25.100
<v Speaker 3>Specific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3370
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:30.830
<v Speaker 3>You can call them terrible people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people like that are Way less </v>

3371
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:32.280
<v Speaker 3>interested in the actual cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're way more Interested in power.</v>

3372
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:35.560
<v Speaker 3>You said that you see people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3373
02:23:35.580 --> 02:23:37.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they're in greenpeace,</v>

3374
02:23:37.450 --> 02:23:39.450
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just are not satisfied with winning</v>

3375
02:23:39.451 --> 02:23:44.451
<v Speaker 3>a victory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are more interested in never </v>

3376
02:23:44.451 --> 02:23:44.451
<v Speaker 3>demonizing and controlling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another group of.</v>

3377
02:23:44.451 --> 02:23:47.130
<v Speaker 3>I also think going back to the oscars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

3378
02:23:47.131 --> 02:23:52.131
<v Speaker 3>there is no black people nominated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could it just be that all the white </v>

3379
02:23:52.231 --> 02:23:55.530
<v Speaker 3>people had great movies that year?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the blood in the.</v>

3380
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:57.660
<v Speaker 3>They never got the major roles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is an issue,</v>

3381
02:23:57.780 --> 02:24:00.870
<v Speaker 3>but it just so happens this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the great movies,</v>

3382
02:24:00.871 --> 02:24:03.980
<v Speaker 3>all the great actors happen to be white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you just chalk it up as race.</v>

3383
02:24:04.580 --> 02:24:08.370
<v Speaker 3>It's a clever move though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're to hollywood.</v>

3384
02:24:08.430 --> 02:24:13.430
<v Speaker 3>there's such pussies that once you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>have protests like this and say oscars </v>

3385
02:24:13.430 --> 02:24:15.900
<v Speaker 3>so white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna fucking panic now.</v>

3386
02:24:16.220 --> 02:24:17.990
<v Speaker 3>Black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh well everyone,</v>

3387
02:24:18.390 --> 02:24:19.200
<v Speaker 3>what they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

3388
02:24:19.201 --> 02:24:22.650
<v Speaker 3>They're going to like the type of movies</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are going to get made.</v>

3389
02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:25.500
<v Speaker 3>They're going to try to make movies for </v>
<v Speaker 3>highly perry's like,</v>

3390
02:24:26.290 --> 02:24:27.270
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not gonna work,</v>

3391
02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:32.070
<v Speaker 3>but that they're going to try to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>really diversity oriented movies.</v>

3392
02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3393
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:34.890
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

3394
02:24:35.010 --> 02:24:38.370
<v Speaker 3>it's all artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is like an adolescent stage,</v>

3395
02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:41.400
<v Speaker 3>so we'll get to that stage and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll just be quality.</v>

3396
02:24:41.401 --> 02:24:46.401
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no denying denzel </v>
<v Speaker 3>washington's one of the greatest actors </v>

3397
02:24:46.401 --> 02:24:46.860
<v Speaker 3>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't give a fuck if he's black.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's fucking spectacular.</v>

3399
02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:51.910
<v Speaker 3>Robert downey jr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he went blackface.</v>

3400
02:24:51.930 --> 02:24:54.600

<v Speaker 3>Don't remember that.</v>

3401

<v Speaker 3>You can't do that today.</v>

3402
02:24:56.860 --> 02:24:58.410
<v Speaker 3>You're creating controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tropic thunder.</v>

3403
02:24:58.410 --> 02:25:00.180
<v Speaker 3>If you tried to do that today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do it.</v>

3404
02:25:00.330 --> 02:25:05.330
<v Speaker 3>He kept saying he was trying to forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did that and he was really amazing </v>

3405

<v Speaker 3>article at some woman who's a crazy </v>

3465
02:27:36.490 --> 02:27:37.270
<v Speaker 3>feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who by the way I went to her page,</v>

<v Speaker 3>anybody who might have any remotely </v>

02:27:52.030 --> 02:27:57.030
<v Speaker 3>probably blocked to herself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his fucking video on it is </v>

3471
02:27:57.030 --> 02:28:01.051
<v Speaker 3>sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does such a good job of covering all </v>

3472
02:28:01.051 --> 02:28:01.051
<v Speaker 3>the points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's self deprecating.</v>

3476
02:28:09.950 --> 02:28:12.460
<v Speaker 3>I'll watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this one like just skewers this,</v>

3477
02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:17.480
<v Speaker 3>the feminist ideology that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to just feel guilty for the </v>

3478
02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:21.331
<v Speaker 3>actions of men that have done horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>things when you haven't done a goddamn </v>

3479
02:28:21.331 --> 02:28:21.331
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like what it is.</v>

3480
02:28:21.740 --> 02:28:22.010
<v Speaker 3>They</v>

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3482
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:26.270
<v Speaker 4>this ability to demonize and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to lose it.</v>

3483
02:28:26.470 --> 02:28:31.470
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can call up and they use to use </v>

3484
02:28:31.470 --> 02:28:32.030
<v Speaker 4>fake statistics like one in four women </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

3485

<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It was a shotty experiment.</v>

3489
02:28:43.971 --> 02:28:48.971
<v Speaker 4>It was bullshit and it's also the </v>
<v Speaker 4>redefined with sexual assault and rape </v>

3490
02:28:48.971 --> 02:28:50.330
<v Speaker 4>isn't to include regret.</v>

3493
02:29:00.110 --> 02:29:02.981
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

3494
02:29:02.981 --> 02:29:02.981
<v Speaker 4>the point where feminists wrote a blog </v>

02:29:02.981 --> 02:29:04.790
<v Speaker 4>like if you have had sex while drunk,</v>

02:30:34.420 --> 02:30:37.550
<v Speaker 4>I know there was nothing she could do to</v>
<v Speaker 4>him that I would press your heart son.</v>

3530
02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:38.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3531
02:30:38.810 --> 02:30:43.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll deal with it bro.</v>

3532
02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:45.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Up,</v>

3533
02:30:45.780 --> 02:30:50.780
<v Speaker 4>confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so much confusion with so many </v>

3534
02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:53.891
<v Speaker 4>of these subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was 14 of an older woman took </v>

3535
02:30:53.891 --> 02:30:54.350
<v Speaker 4>advantage of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have been a.</v>

3536
02:30:54.351 --> 02:30:55.100
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3537
02:30:55.101 --> 02:30:57.170
<v Speaker 4>but if she was your boss and she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>gross.</v>

3538
02:30:57.640 --> 02:30:59.810
<v Speaker 4>If she was your boss and she was gross </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think he was.</v>

3539
02:30:59.890 --> 02:31:01.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a young guy.</v>

3540
02:31:01.700 --> 02:31:02.510
<v Speaker 4>Suck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3541
02:31:02.511 --> 02:31:07.511
<v Speaker 4>but you're a different guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're like an emotionally less </v>

3542
02:31:07.511 --> 02:31:07.511
<v Speaker 4>introverted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3543
02:31:07.511 --> 02:31:09.530
<v Speaker 4>more introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little different for women,</v>

3544
02:31:09.531 --> 02:31:11.810
<v Speaker 4>men guys stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy could be inside your body.</v>

3545
02:31:11.811 --> 02:31:14.110
<v Speaker 4>It's a thousand dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not going to hold them,</v>

3546
02:31:14.111 --> 02:31:17.030
<v Speaker 4>no doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like saying murderer is,</v>

3547
02:31:17.031 --> 02:31:19.920
<v Speaker 4>is really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so don't go.</v>

3548
02:31:19.940 --> 02:31:20.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

3549
02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:22.140
<v Speaker 3>if someone punches someone that's no big</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal,</v>

3550
02:31:22.410 --> 02:31:27.410
<v Speaker 3>but it is like getting knocked out as </v>
<v Speaker 3>not as bad as getting stabbed and </v>

3551
02:31:27.410 --> 02:31:27.900
<v Speaker 3>murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still not good for you.</v>

3552
02:31:28.170 --> 02:31:32.040
<v Speaker 3>So like his position of being sexually </v>
<v Speaker 3>assaulted by a woman is not as bad as an</v>

3553
02:31:32.041 --> 02:31:33.270
<v Speaker 3>ally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's reversed.</v>

3554
02:31:33.430 --> 02:31:38.430
<v Speaker 3>It's fucked up and it is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's hilarious to meet with him at </v>

3555
02:31:38.611 --> 02:31:43.611
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dreading going into work and be locked </v>

3556
02:31:43.611 --> 02:31:44.610

<v Speaker 3>them nonstop.</v>

3557
02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:49.880
<v Speaker 3>What's even more funny as you being </v>
<v Speaker 3>callous about this with a mouthful of </v>

3558
02:31:49.880 --> 02:31:50.610
<v Speaker 3>elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would've downed mocking this guy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that's weird is </v>

3562
02:32:02.270 --> 02:32:04.101
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any sympathy for these </v>

3625
02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:07.320
<v Speaker 3>There's only one time in my entire life </v>
<v Speaker 3>where my ears rang when I came and that </v>

3626
02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:11.491
<v Speaker 3>was when I was in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My girlfriend at the time blew me on a </v>

3627
02:35:11.491 --> 02:35:11.491
<v Speaker 3>porch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're at a port.</v>

3628
02:35:11.491 --> 02:35:14.860
<v Speaker 3>She blew me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I changed the shape of her head.</v>

3629
02:35:18.180 --> 02:35:22.920
<v Speaker 3>Her head became like one of those that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've had their fucking head clamp,</v>

3630
02:35:22.921 --> 02:35:27.921
<v Speaker 3>the one of those skull shaping jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looked like doug came and my ears </v>

3631
02:35:29.291 --> 02:35:33.730
<v Speaker 3>were ultimate orgasm and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

02:35:33.731 --> 02:35:36.260
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this going to happen every time where</v>

3635
02:35:41.170 --> 02:35:42.310
<v Speaker 3>To this day.</v>

3636
02:35:42.311 --> 02:35:44.500
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I just don't jerk off for a couple of</v>

3637

<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I can get back.</v>

02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:47.200
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to get back to the super </v>
<v Speaker 3>soaker.</v>

3639
02:35:48.380 --> 02:35:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Don't have the willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want them to be young forever.</v>

3640

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3643
02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:00.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to stop shooting loads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm just not.</v>

3644
02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:04.060
<v Speaker 3>Now you know what the problem is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It becomes too confusing.</v>

3645
02:36:04.570 --> 02:36:06.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like the same way I feel about </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise.</v>

3646
02:36:06.850 --> 02:36:11.850
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you 10 million bucks people </v>

3647
02:36:11.850 --> 02:36:11.850
<v Speaker 3>exercise for you.</v>

3648
02:36:11.850 --> 02:36:11.850
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

3649
02:36:11.850 --> 02:36:12.040
<v Speaker 3>you can fucking keep your 10 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>bucks.</v>

3650
02:36:12.041 --> 02:36:17.041
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to have a year of </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering just for some money that I'm </v>

3651
02:36:17.041 --> 02:36:17.041
<v Speaker 3>miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it.</v>

3652
02:36:17.041 --> 02:36:18.880
<v Speaker 3>And I feel the same way about jerking </v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

3653
02:36:19.090 --> 02:36:24.090
<v Speaker 3>I think that a lot of ways jerking off </v>
<v Speaker 3>is like a type of exercise because it </v>

3654
02:36:24.090 --> 02:36:27.070
<v Speaker 3>exercises your reproductive system so </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not constantly ramped up.</v>

3655
02:36:27.690 --> 02:36:32.690
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always felt like there's a lot of </v>

3656
02:36:32.690 --> 02:36:34.441
<v Speaker 3>confusion that comes with being a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys on the couch and fucking tell</v>

3657
02:36:34.470 --> 02:36:34.680
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3658
02:36:34.681 --> 02:36:39.470
<v Speaker 3>ants exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it by the fucking job exercise.</v>

3659
02:36:39.580 --> 02:36:41.290
<v Speaker 3>So good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you,</v>

3660
02:36:41.291 --> 02:36:42.490
<v Speaker 3>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta come,</v>

3661
02:36:42.580 --> 02:36:44.650
<v Speaker 3>you gotta get it out of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you don't,</v>

3662
02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:49.680
<v Speaker 3>it pulls up and then your body starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting desperate and lowers your </v>

3663
02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:49.680
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

3664
02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:51.370
<v Speaker 3>your mind starts getting desperate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you start getting like,</v>

3665
02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:55.810
<v Speaker 3>like I remember I went on a dry spell </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was just out of high school.</v>

3666
02:36:55.810 --> 02:37:00.810
<v Speaker 3>I was a fucking complete total loser </v>
<v Speaker 3>from 17 to 18 graduating year.</v>

3667
02:37:02.890 --> 02:37:04.750
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a fucking loser.</v>

3668
02:37:04.751 --> 02:37:07.480
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have not been going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No money couldn't get.</v>

3669
02:37:07.810 --> 02:37:09.220
<v Speaker 3>I had no money at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

3670
02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:11.720
<v Speaker 3>I was girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't give a fuck about taekwondo,</v>

3671
02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:15.500
<v Speaker 3>just we'll kicking and jacket was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was so sad.</v>

3672
02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:18.570
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get my clip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not get lazy,</v>

3673
02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:22.430
<v Speaker 3>so for ever and when I did get laid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I finally did get laid after six months.</v>

3674
02:37:22.431 --> 02:37:24.280
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even stick it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like barely got.</v>

02:37:24.930 --> 02:37:27.740
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just got a fucking loser.</v>

3676
02:37:27.741 --> 02:37:28.750
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but our.</v>

3677
02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:33.870
<v Speaker 3>I remember that desperate feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the desperate nature of it and then</v>

3678
02:37:34.521 --> 02:37:39.521
<v Speaker 3>I started regularly beating off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when I started regularly beating </v>

3679
02:37:39.521 --> 02:37:42.310
<v Speaker 3>off was I was just like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a girlfriend when I was 16.</v>

3680
02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:47.320
<v Speaker 3>I swear to god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got laid before I beat off and people </v>

3681
02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:47.320
<v Speaker 3>think that's a lie.</v>

3682
02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:51.970
<v Speaker 3>It is not weird though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't start beating off when I was </v>

3683
02:37:51.970 --> 02:37:54.170
<v Speaker 3>five and I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I knew about nobody talked to me,</v>

3684
02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:55.850
<v Speaker 3>which I figured out like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you get some vaseline.</v>

<v Speaker 3>not me.</v>

3687
02:37:58.911 --> 02:38:00.600
<v Speaker 3>As a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to rub it into the bed.</v>

3688
02:38:00.770 --> 02:38:04.690
<v Speaker 3>That's all I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Waterproof dick looks,</v>

3689
02:38:04.790 --> 02:38:09.740
<v Speaker 3>freshly waxed gleam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking lots the moisture and I remember</v>

3690
02:38:09.741 --> 02:38:13.310
<v Speaker 3>being maybe fifth or sixth grade and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just having a boner in my sweats.</v>

3691
02:38:13.311 --> 02:38:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3692
02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:17.270
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really had no idea.</v>

3693
02:38:17.330 --> 02:38:20.840
<v Speaker 3>I was hiking and I made a day sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fucking jerk me,</v>

3694
02:38:21.010 --> 02:38:26.010
<v Speaker 3>but happened to me now when I'm fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hiking and I'm thinking about </v>

3695
02:38:26.010 --> 02:38:27.260
<v Speaker 3>something dirty and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody walks by me right now I'm going</v>

3696
02:38:27.261 --> 02:38:29.800
<v Speaker 3>to be a lone guy off trail with a heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

3697
02:38:29.810 --> 02:38:30.930
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of sex,</v>

3698
02:38:30.931 --> 02:38:32.110
<v Speaker 3>something like every three seconds.</v>

3699
02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:35.200
<v Speaker 3>So girls do too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of free girls out there to</v>

3700
02:38:35.210 --> 02:38:38.360
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm my point being like,</v>

3701
02:38:38.600 --> 02:38:43.600
<v Speaker 3>one of the problems was I wasn't jerking</v>
<v Speaker 3>off so desperate and so that's crazy.</v>

3702
02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:48.760
<v Speaker 3>I was desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uber aggressive to smelled of </v>

3703
02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:49.460
<v Speaker 3>desperation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure girls could smell it.</v>

3704
02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:51.470
<v Speaker 3>It was a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a loser.</v>

3705
02:38:51.471 --> 02:38:54.530
<v Speaker 3>I was living with my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a future stone wheel.</v>

3706
02:38:55.630 --> 02:38:58.810
<v Speaker 3>I'd won the state championships like one</v>
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>

3707
02:39:00.300 --> 02:39:04.010
<v Speaker 3>the first one when I was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had no real accomplishments.</v>

3708
02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:05.760
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember those days.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The same guy who came up with regena </v>

3757
02:41:06.201 --> 02:41:07.881
<v Speaker 3>keen is working on right now that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to regenerate collagen in your </v>

3758
02:41:07.881 --> 02:41:10.671
<v Speaker 3>body in a crazy way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's going to eliminate </v>

3759
02:41:10.671 --> 02:41:10.671
<v Speaker 3>wrinkles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

3760
02:41:10.671 --> 02:41:11.760
<v Speaker 3>will never age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're going to age,</v>

3761
02:41:11.761 --> 02:41:16.761
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna fucking die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just going to look good when </v>

3762
02:41:16.761 --> 02:41:16.761
<v Speaker 3>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

3763
02:41:16.761 --> 02:41:19.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you can keep your muscles </v>

3764
02:41:19.700 --> 02:41:19.700
<v Speaker 3>structure and then they shoot that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking shit in your body.</v>

3765
02:41:19.700 --> 02:41:21.690
<v Speaker 3>That regenerates collagen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long we think in.</v>

3766
02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:23.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know because there's all sorts</v>

3767
02:41:23.551 --> 02:41:25.170
<v Speaker 3>of different things they're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>working on,</v>

3768
02:41:25.380 --> 02:41:28.080
<v Speaker 3>so what we're talking about is what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have in 2016.</v>

3769
02:41:28.081 --> 02:41:33.081
<v Speaker 3>What they have in 2016 will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>unrecognizable in 2026 because it'll be </v>

3770
02:41:33.081 --> 02:41:38.030
<v Speaker 3>on such a higher level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all exponential because every </v>

3771
02:41:38.030 --> 02:41:42.111
<v Speaker 3>single invention in every single </v>
<v Speaker 3>technological breakthrough and every </v>

3772
02:41:42.111 --> 02:41:44.610
<v Speaker 3>single medical breakthrough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all converged together and they all</v>

3773
02:41:44.611 --> 02:41:47.370
<v Speaker 3>build on each other and new </v>
<v Speaker 3>technological breakthroughs,</v>

3774
02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:49.680
<v Speaker 3>make new medical breakthroughs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

3775
02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:54.210
<v Speaker 3>New understanding of the body makes new </v>
<v Speaker 3>new designs and new things,</v>

3776
02:41:54.211 --> 02:41:56.400
<v Speaker 3>and then then there's going to be all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of different.</v>

3777
02:41:56.401 --> 02:42:01.401
<v Speaker 3>Like they just came up with some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>lens that they're installing in people </v>

3778
02:42:01.401 --> 02:42:05.180
<v Speaker 3>that is allowing people that weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to see before and now they can see </v>

3779
02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:07.560
<v Speaker 3>new stem cell operations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>

3780
02:42:07.561 --> 02:42:11.340
<v Speaker 3>they're doing what they're doing now is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just the tip of the iceberg.</v>

3781
02:42:11.341 --> 02:42:13.920
<v Speaker 3>We could just stay alive if humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean as a,</v>

3782
02:42:14.010 --> 02:42:19.010
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a race can stay alive for the next </v>

3783
02:42:19.010 --> 02:42:19.010
<v Speaker 3>thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3784
02:42:19.010 --> 02:42:20.820
<v Speaker 3>we won't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll date this machinery,</v>

3785
02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:26.180
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is this biological machinery that </v>

3786
02:42:26.180 --> 02:42:28.131
<v Speaker 3>we let them help the next to come up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with some shit or not guys got about 50 </v>

3787
02:42:28.671 --> 02:42:33.671
<v Speaker 3>in the next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really want to be on a planet where </v>

3788
02:42:33.671 --> 02:42:34.650
<v Speaker 3>everyone can breed and no one dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3789
02:42:34.651 --> 02:42:35.970
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>follow this.</v>

3790
02:42:35.970 --> 02:42:37.810
<v Speaker 3>What if you can download all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

3791
02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:42.840
<v Speaker 3>I killed people like pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does that say about </v>

3792
02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:45.051
<v Speaker 3>accomplishment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could download like how to be </v>

3793
02:42:45.051 --> 02:42:45.051
<v Speaker 3>everything you want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could take approach.</v>

3794
02:42:45.051 --> 02:42:46.830
<v Speaker 3>You see that recently I haven't seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3795
02:42:46.831 --> 02:42:47.760
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

3796
02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:48.930
<v Speaker 3>To pull that up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jamie.</v>

3797
02:42:49.090 --> 02:42:54.090
<v Speaker 3>What scientists have figured out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are very confident that they were </v>

3798
02:42:54.090 --> 02:42:58.161
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be able to download </v>

3799
02:42:58.161 --> 02:43:00.321
<v Speaker 3>skills into your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the fucking matrix fucks us.</v>

3800
02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:04.230
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be able to download </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and skills into your special</v>

3801
02:43:04.231 --> 02:43:04.890
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3802
02:43:04.891 --> 02:43:05.550
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not always.</v>

3803
02:43:05.551 --> 02:43:10.551
<v Speaker 3>No one special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to look any different </v>

3804
02:43:10.551 --> 02:43:12.860
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's going to look like fucking </v>

3805
02:43:12.860 --> 02:43:12.860
<v Speaker 3>john siena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be be around for that.</v>

3806
02:43:12.860 --> 02:43:17.500
<v Speaker 3>What is that size for risks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have to believe that there's a </v>

3807
02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:18.310
<v Speaker 3>reason why they're being nudged in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

3808
02:43:18.610 --> 02:43:21.820
<v Speaker 3>Scientists discover how to upload </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge to your brain.</v>

3809
02:43:22.190 --> 02:43:25.060
<v Speaker 3>This poor girl is the Guinea pig strap </v>
<v Speaker 3>in folks,</v>

3810
02:43:25.150 --> 02:43:30.150
<v Speaker 3>strap in mean we're just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just at the beginning of this </v>

3811
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.150
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

3812
02:43:30.180 --> 02:43:35.180
<v Speaker 3>This is not man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything that's in the matrix is all </v>

3813
02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:35.530
<v Speaker 3>going to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Artificial reality,</v>

3814
02:43:35.531 --> 02:43:37.750
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it's going to take over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world like the matrix.</v>

3815
02:43:37.751 --> 02:43:42.751
<v Speaker 3>We're all going to be locked into some </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking machine and feeds off your </v>

3816
02:43:42.751 --> 02:43:43.690
<v Speaker 3>spine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably not going to happen,</v>

3817
02:43:43.691 --> 02:43:48.691
<v Speaker 3>but what is definitely going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>is virtual reality is going to be </v>

3818
02:43:48.691 --> 02:43:51.241
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable from regular reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always leave scared when we do these </v>

3819
02:43:51.241 --> 02:43:51.241
<v Speaker 3>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we?</v>

3820
02:43:51.241 --> 02:43:54.070
<v Speaker 3>It's not scary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's fascinating.</v>

3821
02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:56.710
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing.</v>

3822
02:43:57.250 --> 02:44:00.400
<v Speaker 3>Here's why it shouldn't be scared </v>
<v Speaker 3>because anybody who's ever lived,</v>

3823
02:44:00.460 --> 02:44:03.520
<v Speaker 3>ever at any time you can go back to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3824
02:44:03.830 --> 02:44:08.830
<v Speaker 3>go back to rome and grab in julius </v>
<v Speaker 3>caesar and take him to 2016.</v>

3825
02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:13.830
<v Speaker 3>He would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be fucking shit made fruit guy</v>

3826
02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:18.840
<v Speaker 3>who lived the best life in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of years ago or a thousand </v>

3827
02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:23.170
<v Speaker 3>years ago would be nothing in comparison</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you if you had to go back.</v>

3828
02:44:23.171 --> 02:44:28.171
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had to go back and you had to </v>

3829
02:44:28.171 --> 02:44:29.701
<v Speaker 3>live like in leonardo da vinci's town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd want to fucking climb up on top of</v>

3830
02:44:30.071 --> 02:44:32.560
<v Speaker 3>a windmill and jump the fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>

3831
02:44:32.561 --> 02:44:37.561
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to eat this shitty bread and </v>

3832
02:44:37.561 --> 02:44:37.561
<v Speaker 3>we're all gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all,</v>

3833
02:44:37.561 --> 02:44:37.740
<v Speaker 3>we're all gonna die of polio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Already ready for that?</v>

3834
02:44:37.741 --> 02:44:39.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get ready for the smallpox epidemic.</v>

3835
02:44:39.551 --> 02:44:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything anytime or rats in town.</v>

3836
02:44:41.621 --> 02:44:46.621
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has to run flag fucking fleas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3837
02:44:47.520 --> 02:44:52.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean you gotta figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that you didn't even know that it </v>

3838
02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:52.520
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't know anything.</v>

3839
02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Those witches curses and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know what the fuck was going</v>

3840
02:44:54.401 --> 02:44:54.610
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

3841
02:44:54.670 --> 02:44:56.650
<v Speaker 3>Or you could go back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

3842
02:44:56.800 --> 02:44:58.870
<v Speaker 3>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you if you knew what you know now.</v>

3843
02:44:59.090 --> 02:44:59.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

3844
02:44:59.950 --> 02:45:04.950
<v Speaker 3>I started drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human beings will evolve with their </v>

3845
02:45:04.950 --> 02:45:04.950
<v Speaker 3>tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

3846
02:45:04.950 --> 02:45:04.950
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You heard a shot,</v>

3847
02:45:04.950 --> 02:45:07.180
<v Speaker 3>you know what you would do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would go back and start,</v>

3848
02:45:07.350 --> 02:45:09.790
<v Speaker 3>you know one day have a thing called a </v>
<v Speaker 3>microwave oven.</v>

3849
02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:11.680
<v Speaker 3>And they'd say he's a which led him on </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire.</v>

3850
02:45:11.710 --> 02:45:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might kill me.</v>

3851
02:45:12.650 --> 02:45:13.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Satisfying.</v>

3852
02:45:13.380 --> 02:45:16.610
<v Speaker 3>Fought with swords too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you had to be a bad ass that I don't</v>

3853
02:45:16.611 --> 02:45:19.960
<v Speaker 3>know if it was a big man and favors the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fastest guy sorta no joke.</v>

3854
02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:23.350
<v Speaker 3>So it's definitely don't favorite big </v>
<v Speaker 3>person to favor someone is strong enough</v>

3855
02:45:23.351 --> 02:45:26.560
<v Speaker 3>to swing the sword as fast as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Public await that.</v>

3856
02:45:26.561 --> 02:45:30.070
<v Speaker 3>You like any like a point of diminishing</v>
<v Speaker 3>returns to its sword fighting.</v>

3857
02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:31.480
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty final sword fighting.</v>

3858
02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:34.480
<v Speaker 3>It's not so fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't walk away from a bloody no.</v>

3859
02:45:34.510 --> 02:45:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting is musashi was a big </v>

3860
02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:39.510
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and my issue was not small men.</v>

3861
02:45:39.820 --> 02:45:41.760
<v Speaker 3>Thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well for.</v>

3862
02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:44.030
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to tell because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

3863
02:45:44.230 --> 02:45:49.230
<v Speaker 3>What they measured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think they probably didn't use </v>

3864
02:45:49.230 --> 02:45:49.230
<v Speaker 3>inches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3865
02:45:49.230 --> 02:45:50.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck they use </v>
<v Speaker 3>described as being,</v>

3866
02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:52.390
<v Speaker 3>I think like thick though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like big,</v>

3867
02:45:52.510 --> 02:45:55.180
<v Speaker 3>big sore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3868
02:45:55.210 --> 02:45:57.160
<v Speaker 3>we had a president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget which president,</v>

3869
02:45:57.161 --> 02:46:00.500
<v Speaker 3>but he was five foot four and he weighed</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hundred pounds.</v>

3870
02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:02.230
<v Speaker 3>Was it taft?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it might've been tapped.</v>

3871
02:46:02.260 --> 02:46:02.950
<v Speaker 3>No tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3872
02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:06.910
<v Speaker 3>not if it was big was a big job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big fat guy.</v>

3873
02:46:06.911 --> 02:46:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Because when I made saying there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat presidents,</v>

3874
02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:10.030
<v Speaker 3>people sent me pictures.</v>

3875

<v Speaker 4>but one of the guys was a hundred </v>

3877
02:46:20.471 --> 02:46:22.640
<v Speaker 4>pounds,</v>

3878
02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:28.000
<v Speaker 4>Tiny little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like a hobbit running the </v>

3879
02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:28.000
<v Speaker 4>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like christina.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He definitely smallest us president.</v>

3882
02:46:33.710 --> 02:46:37.430
<v Speaker 4>He's five for 100 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smallest us president.</v>

3885
02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:46.360
<v Speaker 4>until I was reading my daughter's book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Madison,</v>

3886
02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:47.600

02:47:02.991 --> 02:47:07.991
<v Speaker 4>about number two losers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alexander hamilton doesn't work that </v>

3895
02:47:07.991 --> 02:47:07.991
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

3896
02:47:07.991 --> 02:47:09.110
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's gonna lose at hamilton.</v>

3897
02:47:09.140 --> 02:47:10.370
<v Speaker 4>He was a winner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a new president.</v>

3898
02:47:10.371 --> 02:47:11.090
<v Speaker 4>James madison.</v>

<v Speaker 4>jefferson Washington.</v>

3900
02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:19.780
<v Speaker 4>Hamilton majors person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know who we really dismiss for one </v>

3901
02:47:19.780 --> 02:47:20.790
<v Speaker 4>term presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3902
02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:22.930
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't hamilton the guy that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible.</v>

3903
02:47:22.950 --> 02:47:25.670
<v Speaker 4>He was getting all his fucking friends </v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs and he was really,</v>

3904
02:47:25.700 --> 02:47:27.800
<v Speaker 4>really corrupt and literally wound up </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

3905
02:47:27.830 --> 02:47:30.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm not fit for this job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3906
02:47:31.430 --> 02:47:32.540
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't hamilton.</v>

3907
02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:34.180
<v Speaker 4>It was someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find out who,</v>

3908
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:39.230
<v Speaker 4>whose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whose quote was that I was not fit for </v>

3909
02:47:39.230 --> 02:47:39.230
<v Speaker 4>this job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of the presidents,</v>

3910
02:47:39.230 --> 02:47:43.340
<v Speaker 4>harding harding was considered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was.</v>

3911
02:47:43.430 --> 02:47:46.010
<v Speaker 4>It was considered the worst president </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he was very handsome.</v>

3912
02:47:46.270 --> 02:47:49.550
<v Speaker 4>He's very good looking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was warren harding,</v>

3913
02:47:49.710 --> 02:47:51.800
<v Speaker 4>I think it was warren harding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was very handsome,</v>

3914
02:47:51.801 --> 02:47:53.240
<v Speaker 4>but he was a bad president.</v>

3915
02:47:53.240 --> 02:47:56.510
<v Speaker 4>He just was not a very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he looked really presidential.</v>

3916
02:47:56.511 --> 02:47:57.950
<v Speaker 4>How about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 4>mcgregor down.</v>

3921
02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:14.800
<v Speaker 4>Jfk gets some bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever seen his medical records and </v>

<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>

3923

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3924
02:48:16.190 --> 02:48:18.830
<v Speaker 4>it was Andrew Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What john was.</v>

3925
02:48:18.831 --> 02:48:23.210
<v Speaker 4>Jackson jackson was a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially was considered,</v>

3926
02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:24.830
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd seen a lot of battle.</v>

3927
02:48:24.860 --> 02:48:26.660
<v Speaker 4>He killed a lot of native americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3928
02:48:26.661 --> 02:48:26.870
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3929
02:48:26.871 --> 02:48:28.760
<v Speaker 4>This is the wrong quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the wrong quote.</v>

3930
02:48:29.030 --> 02:48:30.140
<v Speaker 4>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Andrew.</v>

3931
02:48:30.141 --> 02:48:33.620
<v Speaker 4>Jackson was talking about being a great </v>
<v Speaker 4>general and not being.</v>

3932
02:48:34.370 --> 02:48:39.370
<v Speaker 4>Not being a great president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had been shot on tool and he had a </v>

3933
02:48:39.370 --> 02:48:41.600
<v Speaker 4>hole in his in his lung that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>perforate jfk.</v>

3934
02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:46.520
<v Speaker 4>Jfk had gonorrhea and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible back problems.</v>

3935
02:48:47.050 --> 02:48:49.430
<v Speaker 4>He what was his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was on so many drugs.</v>

3936
02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:51.560
<v Speaker 4>Look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The New York times ran a whole thing.</v>

3937
02:48:51.580 --> 02:48:55.910
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe his medical status.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This back issue from partying or what?</v>

3938
02:48:55.940 --> 02:49:00.940
<v Speaker 4>He had a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a congenital fuck this </v>

3939
02:49:00.940 --> 02:49:01.940
<v Speaker 4>fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck dude.</v>

3940
02:49:01.941 --> 02:49:03.920
<v Speaker 4>He will know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went to celebrate this.</v>

3941
02:49:03.921 --> 02:49:07.630
<v Speaker 4>He wore a brace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wore a body brace under his suit moto</v>

3942
02:49:07.650 --> 02:49:09.120
<v Speaker 4>and he had to be in pools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

3943
02:49:09.210 --> 02:49:11.640
<v Speaker 4>He had some kind of degenerative </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>

3944
02:49:11.641 --> 02:49:16.641
<v Speaker 4>I think back when you threw out </v>
<v Speaker 4>gonorrhea and herpes and he was treated </v>

3945
02:49:16.641 --> 02:49:19.050
<v Speaker 4>for gonorrhea is dot treated for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at his medical records,</v>

3946
02:49:19.051 --> 02:49:21.390
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they treated you for gonorrhea,</v>

3947
02:49:21.391 --> 02:49:26.270
<v Speaker 4>did they even get it back then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they just started a runny nose,</v>

3948
02:49:26.510 --> 02:49:28.620
<v Speaker 4>barely penicillin thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3949
02:49:28.621 --> 02:49:32.130
<v Speaker 4>what kind of fucking what kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>lab tests they do back then?</v>

3950
02:49:32.610 --> 02:49:35.940
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty easy to cure with </v>
<v Speaker 4>antibiotics.</v>

3951
02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:38.570
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3952
02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:40.200
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well diseases are weird man,</v>

3953
02:49:40.201 --> 02:49:45.201
<v Speaker 4>because occasionally diseases come along</v>
<v Speaker 4>with it and not exactly sure what you </v>

3954
02:49:45.201 --> 02:49:45.630
<v Speaker 4>have and they have to ask where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>been,</v>

3955
02:49:45.870 --> 02:49:50.870
<v Speaker 4>where'd you go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they have to try to sort of </v>

3956
02:49:50.870 --> 02:49:51.270
<v Speaker 4>narrow it down and test for a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>

3957
02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:52.710
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is an urban myth,</v>

3958
02:49:52.711 --> 02:49:56.690
<v Speaker 4>but the guy emailed this story to me </v>
<v Speaker 4>where the curl comes,</v>

3975
02:50:20.851 --> 02:50:25.851

3988
02:50:54.680 --> 02:50:59.680
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or they hold it far away from you so we </v>

3989
02:50:59.680 --> 02:51:01.710

<v Speaker 4>I could see it happening.</v>

3997
02:51:19.600 --> 02:51:24.600
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense that dead bodies would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have bacteria on them that would be </v>

3998
02:51:24.600 --> 02:51:27.590
<v Speaker 4>eating the dead body and if you had any </v>

<v Speaker 4>He never said anything.</v>

4011

4101
02:55:38.591 --> 02:55:40.910
<v Speaker 1>chicken for the first time.</v>

02:55:45.501 --> 02:55:47.630
<v Speaker 1>How about you figuring out a way to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>salt at the ocean?</v>

4105
02:55:47.631 --> 02:55:50.090
<v Speaker 1>You assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop making dinosaurs.</v>

4107
02:55:55.120 --> 02:55:55.400
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all part of it is all part of it,</v>

4108
02:55:55.401 --> 02:56:00.401
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't expect these guys to make </v>

4109
02:56:00.401 --> 02:56:02.471
<v Speaker 1>better cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a different field of study </v>

4110
02:56:02.471 --> 02:56:05.201
<v Speaker 1>about that life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chickens out about that,</v>

4111
02:56:05.990 --> 02:56:10.990
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ain't about that book about the </v>

4112
02:56:10.990 --> 02:56:10.990
<v Speaker 1>chicken eggs on some pitch.</v>

4113
02:56:14.410 --> 02:56:16.700
<v Speaker 1>It's so rare that someone's job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

4114
02:56:16.701 --> 02:56:18.500
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you watched chickens eat,</v>

4115
02:56:18.501 --> 02:56:23.501
<v Speaker 1>you realize they're just dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just little bit little </v>

4116
02:56:23.501 --> 02:56:23.501
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't kill you,</v>

4117
02:56:23.501 --> 02:56:24.530
<v Speaker 1>so they just deal with it when they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make dick cells.</v>

4118
02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:26.750
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how big do you think guys are?</v>

4119
02:56:26.890 --> 02:56:31.890
<v Speaker 1>How much bigger there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one is going to have a little dick </v>

4120
02:56:31.890 --> 02:56:31.890
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

4121
02:56:31.890 --> 02:56:34.840
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's just going to say you going to </v>

4122
02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:37.940
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big is your dick going to get and </v>

4123
02:56:37.940 --> 02:56:37.940
<v Speaker 1>how many guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

4124
02:56:37.940 --> 02:56:37.940
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

4125
02:56:37.940 --> 02:56:41.400
<v Speaker 1>guys get weird without having surgeries </v>
<v Speaker 1>like just inject my dig and if you can </v>

4126
02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:43.610
<v Speaker 1>jean dope or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For crispr crispr,</v>

4127
02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:48.200
<v Speaker 1>crispr is bad ass going to be at least a</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot long and girls pussies are going to</v>

4128
02:56:48.201 --> 02:56:49.460
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a whole bit about this,</v>

4129
02:56:50.050 --> 02:56:53.030
<v Speaker 1>but the bet if they did come up with big</v>
<v Speaker 1>dick pills,</v>

4130
02:56:53.031 --> 02:56:55.690
<v Speaker 1>like those commercials that ron jeremy </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to sell three in the morning,</v>

4131
02:56:55.691 --> 02:57:00.691
<v Speaker 1>if it was real pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those pills really did make your dick </v>

4132
02:57:00.691 --> 02:57:00.691
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>

4133
02:57:00.691 --> 02:57:02.810
<v Speaker 1>It would be about 30 seconds before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first guy died of an overdose.</v>

4134
02:57:03.150 --> 02:57:06.060
<v Speaker 1>I might because no one's taken one pill </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there.</v>

4135
02:57:06.260 --> 02:57:09.800
<v Speaker 1>How many gives me a stroke?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is dick should be so big.</v>

4136
02:57:09.801 --> 02:57:14.801
<v Speaker 1>The vagina's would grow too because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would still have to breed and </v>

4137
02:57:14.801 --> 02:57:16.130
<v Speaker 1>they would evolve and have to adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said they would turn into giant flying</v>

4138
02:57:16.131 --> 02:57:21.131
<v Speaker 1>squirrel pussy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just people that are jews with </v>

4139
02:57:21.131 --> 02:57:23.981
<v Speaker 1>big dicks that haven't been shopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cart's going to be chasing these girls </v>

4140
02:57:23.981 --> 02:57:26.621
<v Speaker 1>to the top of cliffs and the women would</v>
<v Speaker 1>just leap to safety like squirrel </v>

4141
02:57:28.370 --> 02:57:33.370
<v Speaker 1>squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like imagine what kind of weird shapes </v>

4142
02:57:33.370 --> 02:57:37.661
<v Speaker 1>people are gonna come into like now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're dealing with now is people </v>

4143
02:57:37.661 --> 02:57:40.280
<v Speaker 1>that are starting to explore the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of modifying their body with</v>

4144
02:57:40.281 --> 02:57:44.330
<v Speaker 1>tattoos and piercings or weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you can change the shape,</v>

4145
02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:49.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to lose the </v>

4146
02:57:49.790 --> 02:57:49.790
<v Speaker 1>funnier loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the people.</v>

4147
02:57:49.790 --> 02:57:51.480
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have variety though.</v>

4148
02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Just because everybody has a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of what's beautiful.</v>

4149
02:57:53.481 --> 02:57:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has a different idea of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>

4150
02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Someone's going to want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole is going to be like,</v>

4151
02:57:57.800 --> 02:57:59.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to know I want to be five foot one.</v>

4152
02:57:59.871 --> 02:58:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to keep this.</v>

4153
02:58:01.380 --> 02:58:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I want to keep these</v>

4154
02:58:02.230 --> 02:58:04.320
<v Speaker 4>pits and small day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Madison,</v>

4155
02:58:04.350 --> 02:58:06.750
<v Speaker 4>you'll have less people who are longing </v>
<v Speaker 4>for something.</v>

4156
02:58:06.751 --> 02:58:11.751
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll have if you have an ability and </v>

4157
02:58:11.751 --> 02:58:11.751
<v Speaker 4>the money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's fake,</v>

4158
02:58:11.751 --> 02:58:12.660
<v Speaker 4>but they'll still be people left out </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's going to cost money.</v>

4159
02:58:12.661 --> 02:58:14.040
<v Speaker 4>You're going to ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel me?</v>

4160
02:58:14.041 --> 02:58:19.041
<v Speaker 4>Like reading,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know like it used to be a long time </v>

4161
02:58:19.041 --> 02:58:19.410
<v Speaker 4>ago that reading was a luxury that very </v>
<v Speaker 4>few people could read,</v>

4162
02:58:19.650 --> 02:58:21.600
<v Speaker 4>but now have couldn't afford books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now.</v>

4163
02:58:21.601 --> 02:58:23.910
<v Speaker 4>Pretty much everybody could read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anybody could get books,</v>

4164
02:58:23.940 --> 02:58:28.940
<v Speaker 4>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get so much off the internet </v>

4165
02:58:28.940 --> 02:58:30.771
<v Speaker 4>that's free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get your access to information </v>

4166
02:58:30.771 --> 02:58:30.771
<v Speaker 4>today is better than it's ever been </v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

4167
02:58:30.771 --> 02:58:35.151
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your access to changing your body will </v>

4168
02:58:35.151 --> 02:58:35.970
<v Speaker 4>follow a similar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean happier and it doesn't mean</v>

4169
02:58:35.971 --> 02:58:37.800
<v Speaker 4>that will be more fulfilled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine.</v>

4170
02:58:37.801 --> 02:58:42.801
<v Speaker 4>I think the responsibility to creating </v>
<v Speaker 4>your own fulfillment will still remain </v>

4171
02:58:42.801 --> 02:58:44.700
<v Speaker 4>and they can make artificial happiness.</v>

4172
02:58:44.730 --> 02:58:47.370
<v Speaker 4>Got damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Problem is we like went on drugs,</v>

4173
02:58:47.371 --> 02:58:48.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4174
02:58:48.240 --> 02:58:51.030
<v Speaker 4>Well the problem is what is happened is </v>
<v Speaker 4>really based on just.</v>

4175
02:58:51.630 --> 02:58:53.790
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm talking about ecstasy </v>
<v Speaker 4>all day.</v>

4176
02:58:54.060 --> 02:58:59.060
<v Speaker 4>If you were just rolling all day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no negative repercussions can't get </v>

4177
02:58:59.060 --> 02:59:00.470
<v Speaker 4>shit done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>art wouldn't be created.</v>

4178
02:59:00.480 --> 02:59:01.340
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Art,</v>

4179
02:59:01.380 --> 02:59:04.660
<v Speaker 4>when you get your dick sucked while </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on ecstasy on her son.</v>

4180
02:59:04.920 --> 02:59:09.890
<v Speaker 4>How about you fly like an eagle?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys are fucking god.</v>

4181
02:59:10.120 --> 02:59:11.520
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crisper.</v>

4182
02:59:11.730 --> 02:59:16.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the new god because we're </v>

4183
02:59:16.730 --> 02:59:16.730
<v Speaker 4>controlling our own evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder,</v>

4184
02:59:16.730 --> 02:59:16.730
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what it's gonna look like.</v>

4185
02:59:16.730 --> 02:59:18.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to change.</v>

4186
02:59:18.150 --> 02:59:19.500
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's ever going to go,</v>

4187
02:59:19.501 --> 02:59:21.870
<v Speaker 4>hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's go camping.</v>

4188
02:59:22.380 --> 02:59:23.620
<v Speaker 4>Let's stop all this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4189
02:59:23.910 --> 02:59:27.240
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those dudes that had grown dinosaur legs</v>

4190
02:59:27.241 --> 02:59:29.940
<v Speaker 4>and chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the satisfaction.</v>

4191
02:59:30.320 --> 02:59:34.330
<v Speaker 4>Satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get from overcoming the impossible,</v>

4192
02:59:34.480 --> 02:59:36.480
<v Speaker 4>almost as good as learning kung fu in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the matrix,</v>

4193
02:59:36.690 --> 02:59:39.210
<v Speaker 4>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if someone can take the shortcut,</v>

4194
02:59:39.390 --> 02:59:42.180
<v Speaker 4>don't you think the math is that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>can take the shortcut,</v>

4195
02:59:42.570 --> 02:59:43.770
<v Speaker 4>then I can put the work in.</v>

4196
02:59:43.830 --> 02:59:48.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is that there may be </v>

4197
02:59:48.830 --> 02:59:52.101
<v Speaker 4>shortcuts in certain in certain areas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we'll still have challenges and you </v>

4198
02:59:52.101 --> 02:59:52.380
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hope you're right,</v>

4199
02:59:52.381 --> 02:59:52.600
<v Speaker 4>brian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4200
02:59:52.690 --> 02:59:54.240
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you're really good at something,</v>

4201
02:59:54.241 --> 02:59:55.890
<v Speaker 4>if you're really good at whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to be,</v>

4202
02:59:56.310 --> 02:59:58.420
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4203
02:59:58.421 --> 03:00:00.300
<v Speaker 4>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what I like about tennis,</v>

4204
03:00:00.330 --> 03:00:02.700
<v Speaker 4>what you like about archery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you like about boxing,</v>

4205
03:00:02.701 --> 03:00:07.701
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it the repetition and the state of </v>

4206
03:00:07.701 --> 03:00:10.311
<v Speaker 4>puts you in and the slow attrition of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a skillset is immensely satisfying.</v>

4207
03:00:11.761 --> 03:00:16.761
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if you could just do it right </v>

4208
03:00:16.761 --> 03:00:16.761
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if all the fun goes away.</v>

4209
03:00:16.761 --> 03:00:18.490
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't snow more mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but mr.</v>

4210
03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:21.780
<v Speaker 4>Learning because when you're hitting a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ball really well or you're boxing really</v>

4211
03:00:21.781 --> 03:00:24.400
<v Speaker 4>well one day and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go back.</v>

4212
03:00:24.840 --> 03:00:25.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you go today,</v>

4213
03:00:25.951 --> 03:00:30.951
<v Speaker 4>I hit it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you don't have something to </v>

4214
03:00:30.951 --> 03:00:32.790
<v Speaker 4>compare that to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what happens is you end up being</v>

4215
03:00:32.910 --> 03:00:37.910
<v Speaker 4>generally copacetic and and I wonder </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it says about downloads.</v>

4216
03:00:37.990 --> 03:00:42.990
<v Speaker 4>Skateboarding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a fake ass dude skateboarding like </v>

4217
03:00:42.990 --> 03:00:46.070
<v Speaker 4>I think who you are right now is based </v>
<v Speaker 4>on what our ideas are right now about </v>

4218
03:00:46.070 --> 03:00:48.420
<v Speaker 4>what people want and what people need </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what makes us happy.</v>

4219
03:00:48.630 --> 03:00:51.150
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that makes us </v>
<v Speaker 4>happy is overcoming adversity.</v>

4220
03:00:51.151 --> 03:00:56.151
<v Speaker 4>Trying to figure out puzzles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to set goals and accomplishing </v>

4221
03:00:56.151 --> 03:00:58.841
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Setting goals and accomplishing them is </v>

4222
03:00:58.841 --> 03:00:58.980
<v Speaker 4>one of the biggest sources of happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that people say,</v>

4223
03:00:59.110 --> 03:01:00.370
<v Speaker 4>if you really want to be happy,</v>

4224
03:01:00.370 --> 03:01:03.910
<v Speaker 3>you should have projects and she'd set </v>
<v Speaker 3>goals and she'd try to accomplish those.</v>

4225
03:01:03.911 --> 03:01:08.911
<v Speaker 3>And for whatever reason it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>just some deep seated evolutionary </v>

4226
03:01:08.911 --> 03:01:09.580
<v Speaker 3>reason and it's something that's in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>dna.</v>

4227
03:01:09.610 --> 03:01:13.360
<v Speaker 3>We have this desire to achieve things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when we do achieve them,</v>

4228
03:01:13.570 --> 03:01:16.090
<v Speaker 3>it gives us this feeling of happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't do that,</v>

4229
03:01:16.240 --> 03:01:20.560
<v Speaker 3>like the most regretful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorrowful depressed people,</v>

4230
03:01:20.680 --> 03:01:24.790
<v Speaker 3>rarely set goals and rarely achieve </v>
<v Speaker 3>those set goals for whatever reason.</v>

4231
03:01:24.820 --> 03:01:27.790
<v Speaker 3>Now whether or not the creek and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate on others who are trying to achieve</v>

4232
03:01:27.791 --> 03:01:32.791
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is what we're doing kind of is </v>

4233
03:01:32.791 --> 03:01:35.110
<v Speaker 3>like some sort of a weird balancing act </v>
<v Speaker 3>with our ancient primate minds,</v>

4234
03:01:35.170 --> 03:01:40.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our ancient primate mines which </v>

4235
03:01:40.170 --> 03:01:40.170
<v Speaker 3>wanted to survive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to gather food,</v>

4236
03:01:40.170 --> 03:01:42.490
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to figure out things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I catch this fish?</v>

4237
03:01:42.491 --> 03:01:44.620
<v Speaker 3>How do I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I start a fire?</v>

4238
03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:48.850
<v Speaker 3>And all these different desires that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to both breed,</v>

4239
03:01:48.851 --> 03:01:51.010
<v Speaker 3>protect our territory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>overcome,</v>

4240
03:01:51.011 --> 03:01:56.011
<v Speaker 3>and they manifest themselves as like </v>
<v Speaker 3>rewards and these human rewards are in </v>

4241
03:01:56.171 --> 03:01:57.610
<v Speaker 3>our system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>

4242
03:01:57.730 --> 03:02:02.730
<v Speaker 3>we intrinsically linked those rewards </v>
<v Speaker 3>and in this system to life.</v>

4243
03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:08.040
<v Speaker 3>And this is the only way to live and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the way we live because we've </v>

4244
03:02:08.040 --> 03:02:10.831
<v Speaker 3>always lived like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we can completely remove </v>

4245
03:02:10.831 --> 03:02:15.001
<v Speaker 3>ourselves from the biological process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely remove ourselves from the </v>

4246
03:02:15.020 --> 03:02:19.060
<v Speaker 3>lust and the greed and the what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we become?</v>

4247
03:02:19.150 --> 03:02:21.160
<v Speaker 3>And is that actually a better way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live?</v>

4248
03:02:21.660 --> 03:02:22.980
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's a good question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

4249
03:02:22.990 --> 03:02:24.750
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that you have to add,</v>

4250
03:02:24.820 --> 03:02:27.070
<v Speaker 4>you have to add another dimension to </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you said,</v>

4251
03:02:27.100 --> 03:02:28.610
<v Speaker 4>which is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

4252
03:02:28.620 --> 03:02:33.620
<v Speaker 4>there is that evolutionary notion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reward that creates a feeling of,</v>

4253
03:02:33.671 --> 03:02:35.920
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>safety and whatever it might be.</v>

4254
03:02:36.090 --> 03:02:41.090
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I wonder also if the other reason </v>

4255
03:02:41.090 --> 03:02:44.731
<v Speaker 4>that we seem to have this need to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>better at something like just say the </v>

4256
03:02:44.731 --> 03:02:46.510
<v Speaker 4>violin or whatever it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4257
03:02:46.511 --> 03:02:51.511
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's another thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens to you when you get really good </v>

4258
03:02:51.511 --> 03:02:52.510
<v Speaker 4>at something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you develop this a deep skill,</v>

4259
03:02:52.720 --> 03:02:56.170
<v Speaker 4>I think you get a better understanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>of you.</v>

4260
03:02:56.260 --> 03:03:01.260
<v Speaker 4>Like you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you come closer to who you truly are in </v>

4261
03:03:01.260 --> 03:03:04.771
<v Speaker 4>your essence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The notion that when you do something </v>

4262
03:03:04.771 --> 03:03:07.150
<v Speaker 4>for the sake of its own doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which would be considered play,</v>

4263
03:03:07.490 --> 03:03:09.280
<v Speaker 4>that that's how you would define </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably play.</v>

4264
03:03:10.090 --> 03:03:13.390
<v Speaker 4>That's when you are the most authentic </v>
<v Speaker 4>and truly yourself.</v>

4265
03:03:14.120 --> 03:03:19.120
<v Speaker 4>And I feel like human beings not only </v>
<v Speaker 4>having nostalgia like a built in </v>

4266
03:03:19.120 --> 03:03:21.160
<v Speaker 4>nostalgia to try to find who they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>originally.</v>

4267
03:03:21.730 --> 03:03:26.530
<v Speaker 4>But I think also it's just my general </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that I wonder if,</v>

4268
03:03:26.590 --> 03:03:31.590
<v Speaker 4>because the internet is bringing us all </v>
<v Speaker 4>together and we're getting a deeper </v>

4269
03:03:31.590 --> 03:03:32.680
<v Speaker 4>understanding of what it is to be each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other in one way or another,</v>

4270
03:03:32.770 --> 03:03:37.770
<v Speaker 4>and we're going to end pretty soon if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can download not only information </v>

4271
03:03:37.770 --> 03:03:39.100
<v Speaker 4>but what it's like to be joe rogan into </v>
<v Speaker 4>my brain.</v>

4272
03:03:39.850 --> 03:03:42.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's bringing us all together then,</v>

4273
03:03:42.770 --> 03:03:47.170
<v Speaker 4>then I wonder if the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The end goal is something in the area of</v>

4274
03:03:47.650 --> 03:03:52.650
<v Speaker 4>deep self knowledge and deep knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep human knowledge sort of this </v>

4275
03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:55.330
<v Speaker 4>creating this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this neural net.</v>

4276
03:03:55.331 --> 03:03:57.260
<v Speaker 4>So we're all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry for the,</v>

4277
03:03:57.290 --> 03:04:02.290
<v Speaker 4>for the word one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that that seems to be the two </v>

4278
03:04:02.290 --> 03:04:06.400
<v Speaker 4>thing that that spiritual dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing that's hard to measure has </v>

4279
03:04:06.400 --> 03:04:06.980
<v Speaker 4>always existed in human beings.</v>

4280
03:04:07.170 --> 03:04:09.500
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we somehow always want.</v>

4281
03:04:09.620 --> 03:04:11.090
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's where religion comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

4282
03:04:11.091 --> 03:04:16.091
<v Speaker 4>where inspiration comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We seem to always want to reach beyond </v>

4283
03:04:17.031 --> 03:04:18.350
<v Speaker 4>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

4284
03:04:18.351 --> 03:04:21.560
<v Speaker 4>It's always going to be there no matter </v>
<v Speaker 4>what I was going to be there.</v>

4285
03:04:21.561 --> 03:04:26.561
<v Speaker 4>I think it's going to be there for </v>
<v Speaker 4>operating inside of the biological </v>

4286
03:04:26.561 --> 03:04:26.561
<v Speaker 4>parameters that we currently have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>operate on.</v>

4287
03:04:26.561 --> 03:04:27.390
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we can get out of this,</v>

4288
03:04:27.640 --> 03:04:29.510
<v Speaker 4>think history will be taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If what?</v>

4289
03:04:29.511 --> 03:04:31.190
<v Speaker 4>If?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if they can eliminate greed,</v>

4290
03:04:31.320 --> 03:04:36.320
<v Speaker 4>would agree the the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the instinct of greed can be located in </v>

4291
03:04:36.320 --> 03:04:37.670
<v Speaker 4>our genome and can be eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4292
03:04:37.671 --> 03:04:38.790
<v Speaker 4>greed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>greed,</v>

4293
03:04:39.580 --> 03:04:41.300
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mighty might be valuable.</v>

4294
03:04:41.570 --> 03:04:43.100
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jealousy,</v>

4295
03:04:43.101 --> 03:04:45.290
<v Speaker 4>might be valuable to greet also may be </v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

4296
03:04:45.291 --> 03:04:50.291
<v Speaker 4>Also be that that primordial need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>amass as much food and as much what?</v>

4297
03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:55.360
<v Speaker 4>Safety and as much power so that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>stay alive.</v>

4298
03:04:55.390 --> 03:05:00.390
<v Speaker 4>That's the one thing we know is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings across the board what love </v>

4299
03:05:00.390 --> 03:05:01.090
<v Speaker 4>one thing above all and that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>immortality.</v>

4300
03:05:01.290 --> 03:05:04.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm thinking is a lot of our ideas,</v>

4301
03:05:05.030 --> 03:05:10.030
<v Speaker 4>a lot of our ideas of what was valuable </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what we want and what we need and </v>

4302
03:05:10.030 --> 03:05:14.741
<v Speaker 4>what is just part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of those ideas are only based on </v>

4303
03:05:14.741 --> 03:05:15.510
<v Speaker 4>the current model of human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4304
03:05:15.550 --> 03:05:20.550
<v Speaker 4>That exists when they start manipulating</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit and downloading new thoughts in </v>

4305
03:05:20.550 --> 03:05:24.591
<v Speaker 4>your mind and do you want to go like </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking meditate in a in an ashram for </v>

4306
03:05:24.891 --> 03:05:28.640
<v Speaker 4>10 years and sweep up and just home all </v>
<v Speaker 4>day in the corner,</v>

4307
03:05:28.730 --> 03:05:32.660
<v Speaker 4>or how about they just press a button </v>
<v Speaker 4>and shoot some shit straightened to your</v>

4308
03:05:32.661 --> 03:05:35.300
<v Speaker 4>brain and you could read minds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to take that.</v>

4309
03:05:35.520 --> 03:05:37.790
<v Speaker 4>You're going to take like instant </v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment.</v>

4310
03:05:37.940 --> 03:05:42.940
<v Speaker 4>You're going to take the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcend all of our biological </v>

4311
03:05:42.940 --> 03:05:46.991
<v Speaker 4>impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including the dumb ones like self doubt </v>

4312
03:05:46.991 --> 03:05:48.660
<v Speaker 4>and fear and hate and jealousy like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

4313
03:05:49.970 --> 03:05:51.290
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

4314
03:05:51.291 --> 03:05:52.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the real thing.</v>

4315
03:05:52.461 --> 03:05:57.461
<v Speaker 4>Even if you can even like ray kurzweil </v>
<v Speaker 4>who created this sort of movement of </v>

4316
03:05:57.461 --> 03:05:58.250
<v Speaker 4>curve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chris wireless,</v>

4317
03:05:58.251 --> 03:05:59.730
<v Speaker 4>the notion that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

4318
03:05:59.810 --> 03:06:03.170
<v Speaker 4>we all say we're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all know human beings have one goal.</v>

4319
03:06:03.171 --> 03:06:06.230
<v Speaker 4>It's to stay alive forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's why we do great work and we want it</v>

4320
03:06:06.231 --> 03:06:07.490
<v Speaker 4>to live on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have children.</v>

4321
03:06:07.491 --> 03:06:09.170
<v Speaker 4>That's why we were so attached to our </v>
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>

4322
03:06:09.620 --> 03:06:12.680
<v Speaker 4>if not necessarily true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we do because we enjoy it.</v>

4323
03:06:12.681 --> 03:06:17.681
<v Speaker 4>While we're doing that to 100 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have kids thinking going to live on,</v>

4324
03:06:17.751 --> 03:06:20.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you make.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't make a painting.</v>

4325
03:06:20.271 --> 03:06:21.680
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This will go on forever.</v>

4326
03:06:21.681 --> 03:06:23.900
<v Speaker 4>You have this idea in your head and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanna express yourself.</v>

4327
03:06:24.340 --> 03:06:25.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4328
03:06:25.120 --> 03:06:27.740
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you on that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just think that overall,</v>

4329
03:06:27.741 --> 03:06:32.741
<v Speaker 4>if you looked at the general overall </v>
<v Speaker 4>over arching sort of desire,</v>

4330
03:06:32.751 --> 03:06:37.751
<v Speaker 4>a need in a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably we all want to live </v>

4331
03:06:37.751 --> 03:06:37.751
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to die.</v>

4332
03:06:37.751 --> 03:06:39.250
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just a fear of death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>desire,</v>

4333
03:06:41.110 --> 03:06:42.110
<v Speaker 4>follow this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4334
03:06:42.240 --> 03:06:45.620
<v Speaker 4>so if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we can download our essence,</v>

4335
03:06:45.710 --> 03:06:47.230
<v Speaker 4>if I could download everything that's in</v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain,</v>

4336
03:06:47.240 --> 03:06:52.240
<v Speaker 4>your memories and your paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your paradigm or whatever the words are </v>

4337
03:06:52.240 --> 03:06:56.280
<v Speaker 4>a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I could put that into a </v>

4338
03:06:56.280 --> 03:06:56.280
<v Speaker 4>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a or a robot.</v>

4339
03:06:56.280 --> 03:06:58.020
<v Speaker 3>Then you kind of keep living forever in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a way.</v>

4340
03:06:58.021 --> 03:07:03.021
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does that say about when you </v>

4341
03:07:03.021 --> 03:07:03.021
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like whatever you are,</v>

4342
03:07:03.021 --> 03:07:04.320
<v Speaker 3>if they download you and put you in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer,</v>

4343
03:07:04.350 --> 03:07:09.350
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have all your flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or is it going to be filled with all </v>

4344
03:07:09.350 --> 03:07:11.640
<v Speaker 3>your insecurities going to be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it going to be a liar,</v>

4345
03:07:11.680 --> 03:07:16.680
<v Speaker 3>imagined the computer becomes a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if the computer or develops its </v>

4346
03:07:16.680 --> 03:07:19.881
<v Speaker 3>own insecurities and starts coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It changes who you are and starts going </v>

4347
03:07:19.881 --> 03:07:21.150
<v Speaker 3>down its own weird emotional paths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are programmed in.</v>

4348
03:07:21.360 --> 03:07:26.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely you're going to program </v>

4349
03:07:26.360 --> 03:07:28.311
<v Speaker 3>something where when you going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to probably have to </v>

4350
03:07:28.311 --> 03:07:31.341
<v Speaker 3>differentiate between what you are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you love and what your memories are</v>

4351
03:07:31.740 --> 03:07:33.560
<v Speaker 3>and all the negative stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4352
03:07:33.561 --> 03:07:38.561
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're part of what makes you great and </v>

4353
03:07:38.561 --> 03:07:38.561
<v Speaker 3>your essence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

4354
03:07:38.561 --> 03:07:39.630
<v Speaker 3>for all three of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know jamie well enough,</v>

4355
03:07:39.631 --> 03:07:42.420
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure and his is our reaction.</v>

4356
03:07:42.530 --> 03:07:45.450
<v Speaker 3>It part of what a bit part of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>personalities,</v>

4357
03:07:45.480 --> 03:07:50.480
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a reaction to our shortcomings is the</v>

4358
03:07:51.121 --> 03:07:56.121
<v Speaker 3>compensation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the measures we've taken to compensate </v>

4359
03:07:56.121 --> 03:07:56.121
<v Speaker 3>for our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4360
03:07:56.280 --> 03:07:59.310
<v Speaker 3>limitations would not just that your </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences,</v>

4361
03:07:59.690 --> 03:08:00.240
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4362
03:08:00.260 --> 03:08:03.780
<v Speaker 3>the trials and tribulations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this failures and successes,</v>

4363
03:08:03.960 --> 03:08:06.750
<v Speaker 3>the struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the struggle defines your personality.</v>

4364
03:08:06.960 --> 03:08:11.960
<v Speaker 3>You show me a guy who doesn't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything and I'll show you a guy who </v>

4365
03:08:11.960 --> 03:08:11.960
<v Speaker 3>can't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4366
03:08:11.960 --> 03:08:15.660
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you show me a guy who's </v>

4367
03:08:15.660 --> 03:08:15.660
<v Speaker 3>accomplished all or a woman who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplished all sorts of things.</v>

4368
03:08:15.660 --> 03:08:18.210
<v Speaker 3>She can continue to accomplish things </v>
<v Speaker 3>because she knows how to get shit done,</v>

4369
03:08:18.260 --> 03:08:23.260
<v Speaker 3>but she's also learned how to fail and </v>
<v Speaker 3>be anyone who's successful has failed so</v>

4370
03:08:24.481 --> 03:08:25.350
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4371
03:08:25.351 --> 03:08:30.351
<v Speaker 3>that's where wisdom comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wisdom is the acknowledgement not only </v>

4372
03:08:30.351 --> 03:08:33.801
<v Speaker 3>of your limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wisdom is also knowing what to do </v>

4373
03:08:33.801 --> 03:08:37.881
<v Speaker 3>with those limitations until they </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking strap you to that machine and </v>

4374
03:08:37.881 --> 03:08:39.600
<v Speaker 3>shoved those fucking genius thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 3>right into your dome.</v>

4375
03:08:39.600 --> 03:08:42.450
<v Speaker 3>So that the same as being high though </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

4376
03:08:42.630 --> 03:08:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the same as keeping the dmt </v>
<v Speaker 3>trip going forever?</v>

4377
03:08:45.780 --> 03:08:50.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dmt trip removes reality as we know </v>

4378
03:08:50.780 --> 03:08:50.780
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets weird.</v>

4379
03:08:50.780 --> 03:08:53.460
<v Speaker 3>So another dinette dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4380
03:08:53.610 --> 03:08:54.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know that.</v>

4381
03:08:55.200 --> 03:08:58.350
<v Speaker 3>It certainly feels like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could just be hallucinations.</v>

4382
03:08:58.351 --> 03:09:03.351
<v Speaker 3>It could all be going on in your head </v>
<v Speaker 3>and said what you get because they have </v>

4383
03:09:03.351 --> 03:09:04.920
<v Speaker 3>ever done you get from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do it on my own for no reason.</v>

4384
03:09:05.180 --> 03:09:10.180
<v Speaker 3>What you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you get from it is something that </v>

4385
03:09:10.180 --> 03:09:13.491
<v Speaker 3>is exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like someone say like maybe it's all in </v>

4386
03:09:13.491 --> 03:09:14.280
<v Speaker 3>your head when you trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's not really happening.</v>

4387
03:09:14.281 --> 03:09:16.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>May be however,</v>

4388
03:09:16.320 --> 03:09:21.320
<v Speaker 3>the experience is exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you really are going into another </v>

4389
03:09:21.320 --> 03:09:24.711
<v Speaker 3>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really are experiencing love in its </v>

4390
03:09:24.711 --> 03:09:27.411
<v Speaker 3>purest form and forgiveness and just 100</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent wisdom like all the bullshit and</v>

4391
03:09:29.641 --> 03:09:34.641
<v Speaker 3>all the flaws of your thinking and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the ridiculous aspects of the world </v>

4392
03:09:35.281 --> 03:09:40.260
<v Speaker 3>around you revealed in some wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 3>dance by gestures who are giving you the</v>

4393
03:09:40.261 --> 03:09:43.350
<v Speaker 3>finger and a never ending complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>geometric pattern.</v>

4394
03:09:43.710 --> 03:09:46.730
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still the same experience.</v>

4395
03:09:46.980 --> 03:09:51.980
<v Speaker 3>Like if you really do go to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension and you really do experience </v>

4396
03:09:51.980 --> 03:09:54.681
<v Speaker 3>these in incredibly enlightened being </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they really do instill upon your </v>

4397
03:09:54.681 --> 03:09:54.681
<v Speaker 3>wisdom and you really</v>

4398
03:09:54.681 --> 03:09:58.180
<v Speaker 4>do hold onto a few grains of sand that </v>
<v Speaker 4>slips through your fingers.</v>

4399
03:09:58.210 --> 03:10:00.130
<v Speaker 4>Hold onto a little bit of it while </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're there.</v>

4400
03:10:00.131 --> 03:10:02.260
<v Speaker 4>You got handfuls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you just hold onto a little bit.</v>

4401
03:10:02.440 --> 03:10:04.500
<v Speaker 4>It's still the same experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit's real son.</v>

4402
03:10:04.690 --> 03:10:05.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a little bit like,</v>

4403
03:10:05.711 --> 03:10:09.790
<v Speaker 4>you know what changed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way I argue is that somebody said,</v>

4404
03:10:10.090 --> 03:10:15.090
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you may think that that person's point </v>

4405
03:10:15.090 --> 03:10:15.090
<v Speaker 4>of view is shitty or you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>respect for it,</v>

4406
03:10:15.090 --> 03:10:17.350
<v Speaker 4>or they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they're acting crazy to them.</v>

4407
03:10:17.351 --> 03:10:19.450
<v Speaker 4>Those feelings and emotions are very </v>
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>

4408
03:10:19.690 --> 03:10:21.390
<v Speaker 4>So if you start the argument by saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4409
03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:24.030
<v Speaker 4>that's why if you look at like political</v>
<v Speaker 4>discussions as country,</v>

4410
03:10:24.031 --> 03:10:29.031
<v Speaker 4>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get gun rights advocates and you </v>

4411
03:10:29.031 --> 03:10:29.110
<v Speaker 4>have gun control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first thing they do is they go,</v>

4412
03:10:29.111 --> 03:10:31.000
<v Speaker 4>you're a gun nut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the other ones go,</v>

4413
03:10:31.001 --> 03:10:32.410
<v Speaker 4>you're a bleeding heart liberal pussy.</v>

4414
03:10:32.830 --> 03:10:34.780
<v Speaker 4>You start the argument there and guess </v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

4415
03:10:35.070 --> 03:10:35.850
<v Speaker 4>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

4416
03:10:35.910 --> 03:10:40.910
<v Speaker 4>there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's having a conversation anymore </v>

4417
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:43.141
<v Speaker 4>because you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like you atheists and religious </v>

4418
03:10:43.141 --> 03:10:43.141
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>religious people,</v>

4419
03:10:43.141 --> 03:10:44.800
<v Speaker 4>feminazis male,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mrs.</v>

4420
03:10:44.860 --> 03:10:49.860
<v Speaker 4>You'll never have a marriage between the</v>
<v Speaker 4>religious people who are very religious </v>

4421
03:10:49.860 --> 03:10:54.451
<v Speaker 4>and people who are strictly scientific </v>
<v Speaker 4>because what happens is instead of </v>

4422
03:10:54.451 --> 03:10:57.790
<v Speaker 4>saying that religious person is </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious and he gains inspiration and a</v>

4423
03:10:57.791 --> 03:11:02.791
<v Speaker 4>feeling that's very important to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>person and they're going to guard that </v>

4424
03:11:02.791 --> 03:11:03.580
<v Speaker 4>feeling because it makes them feel good </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the world.</v>

4425
03:11:03.970 --> 03:11:06.550
<v Speaker 4>If you come in as an atheist or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientist and say,</v>

4426
03:11:06.610 --> 03:11:08.440
<v Speaker 4>everything about you is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4427
03:11:08.441 --> 03:11:11.230
<v Speaker 4>that's a big fairytale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just shut down the debate.</v>

4428
03:11:11.231 --> 03:11:13.030
<v Speaker 4>You just broke that bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're never gonna.</v>

4429
03:11:13.140 --> 03:11:14.350
<v Speaker 4>You're never gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See anything.</v>

4430
03:11:14.380 --> 03:11:15.880
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to see that person for </v>
<v Speaker 4>who they are.</v>

4431
03:11:15.881 --> 03:11:20.881
<v Speaker 4>Never going to understand even if what </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're experiencing or what they </v>

4432
03:11:20.881 --> 03:11:22.660
<v Speaker 4>believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the faith is not real.</v>

4433
03:11:22.870 --> 03:11:27.870
<v Speaker 4>They still can get a tangible benefits </v>
<v Speaker 4>summit and it can impact their life and </v>

4434
03:11:27.870 --> 03:11:28.000
<v Speaker 4>so with Israel in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

4435
03:11:28.210 --> 03:11:33.210
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is something that they believe in to </v>

4436
03:11:33.210 --> 03:11:33.670
<v Speaker 4>the point where it benefits them and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>can create beautiful things.</v>

4437
03:11:33.700 --> 03:11:35.440
<v Speaker 4>Great pieces of work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>art,</v>

4438
03:11:35.470 --> 03:11:37.960
<v Speaker 4>whatever it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my argument about ben carson.</v>

4439
03:11:38.110 --> 03:11:43.110
<v Speaker 4>Ben carson might be a wacky dude who </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't believe in evolution is you had </v>

4440
03:11:43.110 --> 03:11:47.161
<v Speaker 4>some crazy ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I like him as much as any of the </v>

4441
03:11:47.161 --> 03:11:47.161
<v Speaker 4>other people that are running for </v>
<v Speaker 4>president or dude,</v>

4442
03:11:47.161 --> 03:11:49.960
<v Speaker 4>he's not just smart dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the best neurosurgeons ever.</v>

4443
03:11:50.020 --> 03:11:51.130
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>

4444
03:11:51.250 --> 03:11:56.250
<v Speaker 4>he's really like measured and relaxed </v>
<v Speaker 4>and calm always because he never gets </v>

4445
03:11:57.011 --> 03:12:00.580
<v Speaker 4>too high or too emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like yelling at someone the other day,</v>

4446
03:12:00.820 --> 03:12:05.260
<v Speaker 4>go home and get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is gonna be our president,</v>

4447
03:12:05.470 --> 03:12:09.640
<v Speaker 4>go home and get a job and all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking white dudes with golf shirts on.</v>

4448
03:12:11.770 --> 03:12:13.720
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't have his eye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas his idea,</v>

4449
03:12:13.721 --> 03:12:18.721
<v Speaker 4>his where his ideas for his id.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping that once he becomes </v>

4450
03:12:18.721 --> 03:12:18.760
<v Speaker 4>president because it's going to become </v>
<v Speaker 4>president,</v>

4451
03:12:18.940 --> 03:12:22.000
<v Speaker 4>then he lets it go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because what ben carson said about trump</v>

4452
03:12:22.001 --> 03:12:27.001
<v Speaker 4>that I thought was really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says he's remarkably reasonable when </v>

4453
03:12:27.001 --> 03:12:27.490
<v Speaker 4>he's not on camera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so what?</v>

4454
03:12:27.850 --> 03:12:30.310
<v Speaker 4>Jeff ross told me that too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because ben's endorsing them now.</v>

4455
03:12:30.430 --> 03:12:35.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he's a dumb guy and I </v>

4456
03:12:35.430 --> 03:12:37.110
<v Speaker 4>think a lot of it's worth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you may see if he becomes </v>

4457
03:12:38.231 --> 03:12:39.160
<v Speaker 4>president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two things.</v>

4458
03:12:39.161 --> 03:12:44.161
<v Speaker 4>One is he probably comes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not an idea was so therefore he's </v>

4459
03:12:44.261 --> 03:12:45.760
<v Speaker 4>not an ideologue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he's going to do this.</v>

4460
03:12:45.761 --> 03:12:48.310
<v Speaker 4>I think he will approach everything as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem to be solved,</v>

4461
03:12:48.311 --> 03:12:49.660
<v Speaker 4>which is not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Secondly,</v>

4462
03:12:49.870 --> 03:12:52.550
<v Speaker 4>don't be surprised if he surrounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself with very competent,</v>

4463
03:12:52.551 --> 03:12:55.350
<v Speaker 4>smart people who know more than he does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4464
03:12:55.370 --> 03:12:58.100
<v Speaker 4>that those are the two silver silver </v>
<v Speaker 4>linings.</v>

4465
03:12:58.100 --> 03:12:59.900
<v Speaker 4>I can see trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4466
03:13:00.050 --> 03:13:03.380
<v Speaker 4>coming to the pin holes on the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the guy.</v>

4467
03:13:03.440 --> 03:13:08.440
<v Speaker 4>He breaks the system because the system </v>
<v Speaker 4>of special interest groups and the need </v>

4468
03:13:08.440 --> 03:13:08.630
<v Speaker 4>for this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

4469
03:13:08.640 --> 03:13:11.930
<v Speaker 4>the campaign financing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you get a guy like him who doesn't,</v>

4470
03:13:12.110 --> 03:13:14.570
<v Speaker 4>he really can't buy him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't benefit.</v>

4471
03:13:14.860 --> 03:13:19.860
<v Speaker 4>He has a problem with campaign finance </v>
<v Speaker 4>reform is that sit with citizens united.</v>

4472
03:13:20.551 --> 03:13:25.551
<v Speaker 4>That supreme court decision giving money</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a political campaign is in the </v>

4473
03:13:27.770 --> 03:13:30.830
<v Speaker 4>exercise of free speech and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>considered constitutional.</v>

4474
03:13:30.831 --> 03:13:34.220
<v Speaker 4>So it's very difficult to get big money </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

4475
03:13:34.250 --> 03:13:37.250
<v Speaker 4>But what I do think will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're seeing it already with people</v>

4476
03:13:37.251 --> 03:13:39.110
<v Speaker 4>like bernie sanders and even Donald </v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump,</v>

4477
03:13:39.410 --> 03:13:42.290
<v Speaker 4>is that we as citizens will go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4478
03:13:42.500 --> 03:13:44.510
<v Speaker 4>you have big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep pockets,</v>

4479
03:13:44.600 --> 03:13:49.040
<v Speaker 4>deep political pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you must be a little corrupt.</v>

4480
03:13:49.041 --> 03:13:51.880
<v Speaker 4>At least I ain't voting for you when </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's transparency.</v>

4481
03:13:51.890 --> 03:13:56.890
<v Speaker 4>So things like crowdpac where you can go</v>
<v Speaker 4>and find exactly who's financing people </v>

4482
03:13:56.890 --> 03:14:00.650
<v Speaker 4>crowdpac which my friend steve hilton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good thing you go and check out.</v>

4483
03:14:00.651 --> 03:14:04.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean they've got their website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has all of the various campaign funds,</v>

4484
03:14:04.491 --> 03:14:04.990
<v Speaker 4>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4485
03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.370
<v Speaker 4>the people that are influencing all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>special interest groups.</v>

4486
03:14:07.371 --> 03:14:08.300
<v Speaker 4>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tight move.</v>

4487
03:14:08.301 --> 03:14:09.830
<v Speaker 4>We got to get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thirty five,</v>

4488
03:14:09.831 --> 03:14:12.540
<v Speaker 4>40.</v>
