00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.860
Hey dirty fucks.

2
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.430
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by stamps.com

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.140
if you have a small business and you have to go to the post office,

4
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.590
you know what a pain in the deck that can be.

5
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.060
That shit ain't good for you.

6
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.290
That's stress.

7
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.780
That stress can be avoided if you stamps.com which you can do is they give you

8
00:00:28.781 --> 00:00:29.830
your own digital scale.

9
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.290
You could print up all your shit on your own PC or computer,

10
00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:35.711
Mac,

11
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:36.431
Mac or PC.

12
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:41.431
Either one works and you just put your own postage on it and then the post

13
00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:45.670
office comes and they pick it up and that's it.

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.680
You don't have to do any of that waiting online shit.

15
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.870
You don't have to wait like so many ways.

16
00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:51.520
Your stuff and then figure it all out.

17
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.840
You do it all from your house.

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.350
It's super easy and people that are operating small businesses like a,

19
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.420
if you buy any of the desk,

20
00:00:58.421 --> 00:00:59.740
squad.tv tee shirts,

21
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.480
this is how Brian sends him.

22
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.380
Yeah,

23
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.460
<v 2>so no other way to do it.</v>

24
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.971
I mean,

25
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:04.690
if you have any,

26
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.750
like a small business or even if you're just like getting into something like an

27
00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:09.970
online store like Etsy or something,

28
00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:12.360
when you went sell like some art work or anything that you're,

29
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:13.390
you're shipping stuff out,

30
00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:15.680
there's no reason to go to that post office nowadays.

31
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.730
Just some freak pitch and wants to sell panties.

32
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.490
Right.

33
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.901
But you know,

34
00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:21.550
you don't want to go to the post office,

35
00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:23.050
the dirty start weighing panties,

36
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.440
which you want to do is how many boys he sent panties to figure this shit out.

37
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.840
That's,

38
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.040
that could be a business man.

39
00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:33.370
I guarantee you there's money in that because Duncan knew a girl who would wear

40
00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:34.300
socks and stuff.

41
00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:37.210
They would want her to get her feet stinky and then she would send them dirty

42
00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:37.600
socks.

43
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.430
Statute wasn't or anything like dirty stench.

44
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.630
It had,

45
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.550
she had some sort of an unfortunate name,

46
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.480
but she called herself.

47
00:01:43.481 --> 00:01:44.590
But that was like her thing.

48
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:45.424
Like she would,

49
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.971
she would,

50
00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:46.600
uh,

51
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.660
get paid to wear underwear for like several days in a row.

52
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.820
She was the first person I ever knew actually did that.

53
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.431
Not yet.

54
00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:53.051
And then I want you to,

55
00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:54.790
did she fucking did it legit?

56
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.490
Like if they told her she had to wear socks for like three days,

57
00:01:57.491 --> 00:02:00.220
she would wear socks for three days and she wouldn't let a guy do it.

58
00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:00.401
Like,

59
00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:00.581
no,

60
00:02:00.581 --> 00:02:01.630
you can't wear my socks.

61
00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:03.430
Like it has to be my stinky feet.

62
00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:05.170
If there had to be like a tan stain,

63
00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:06.160
at least maybe they do.

64
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.140
Maybe you could smell it and you're like,

65
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:10.810
there's no way a chick's feet smelled this fucking bad.

66
00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:12.610
I'm not beating off to a dude stinky feet.

67
00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:13.190
Got Damn.

68
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.890
It sounded like somebody wouldn't know that I'm cutting maybe.

69
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.520
Yeah.

70
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.731
Yeah,

71
00:02:18.731 --> 00:02:19.190
that is,

72
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.690
that does sound like someone who had no Dunkin a and that might be something too

73
00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:23.471
that it might be.

74
00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:26.710
If you want to keep an honest foot stinky socks business,

75
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.573
you gotta,

76
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.720
you gotta do the right thing.

77
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.430
That was going through a phase of his life,

78
00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:31.960
I think often it was hanging out with that girl.

79
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.131
Well yes,

80
00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:33.640
this is,

81
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.810
this is getting very personal.

82
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.500
If you go to stamps.com and click on,

83
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.770
there's a little microphone in the upper right hand corner and around the code

84
00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:49.570
word j r e and you get this a sweet deal where they give you,

85
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.210
they give you a free digital

86
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.901
<v 1>Gail,</v>

87
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:53.500
they give you a 55 bucks and,

88
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.410
and postal coupons.

89
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.490
Um,

90
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.841
it's,

91
00:02:56.841 --> 00:02:58.650
it's a sweet deal and uh,

92
00:02:58.651 --> 00:02:59.170
you can,

93
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.040
you can save a lot of money

94
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.620
<v 2>to up to 80% compared to a meter.</v>

95
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.420
That's according to them.

96
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.570
I have done no research and that scale is pretty bad ass.

97
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.710
You just hook it up to your computer.

98
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.970
Don't use it for pot.

99
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:10.750
You fucks.

100
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.710
This is for selling,

101
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.240
sending shit through the mail.

102
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.360
And I would advise you to not send pop through the mail.

103
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.030
I think that's like really Dana.

104
00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:18.864
That's super label.

105
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.511
Yeah.

106
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:20.200
Isn't that funny?

107
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.033
Like you can,

108
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.630
if you carry it in your ass,

109
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.990
it's less illegal than if you send it across state lines.

110
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.590
Like if you stuff a half a pound of weed up your ass,

111
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.090
they'll at least be impressed.

112
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.201
How put bound,

113
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:32.530
yeah.

114
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.010
Yeah.

115
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.060
But if you stuff,

116
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.270
you know

117
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.103
<v 3>a teddy bear,</v>

118
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.963
my ass,

119
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.820
my ass is broad capacity

120
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.110
<v 2>only person I've ever seen that brags about how big their asses the inside of</v>

121
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:47.441
the acids.

122
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:48.370
Dana D Armand.

123
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.330
Oh yeah.

124
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.180
Talking about a whole bigger butters because she fits cat toys up there.

125
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.680
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

126
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.040
It's weird like some of those gaping videos when you could see shadows on the

127
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:56.431
wall,

128
00:03:56.431 --> 00:03:57.264
it's pretty bad.

129
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.400
<v 2>There's no need for that gaping stuff.</v>

130
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.670
That's the society gone wrong when they look back at us in the future.

131
00:04:02.671 --> 00:04:06.900
The way we look at Rome and the vomitorium comes and all the doodling of the

132
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:10.170
young people that they're going to look at us and gaping going,

133
00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:12.270
what the fuck they were into gay cause it's they,

134
00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:12.630
they would,

135
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.640
they won't really represent what a small percentage of the population actually

136
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:15.961
and George,

137
00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:16.740
those videos,

138
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.720
just the fact that they exist is,

139
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.960
<v 1>it's evidence enough that we've gotten mad.</v>

140
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.400
We've gone completely mad.

141
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.750
We're spitting inside girls assholes.

142
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.200
We're opening them up and spitting in there and that's,

143
00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:28.591
that's a,

144
00:04:28.591 --> 00:04:30.570
a genre in pornography.

145
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.650
It's not like a onetime thing like somebody went and then I lost my mind,

146
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:35.190
man.

147
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.050
I opened number button,

148
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.721
I spit in there.

149
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:38.220
I don't even know what the fuck I was doing.

150
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.701
Dude,

151
00:04:38.701 --> 00:04:39.600
don't do that again.

152
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:40.990
I mean that's so disrespectful.

153
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.911
How do you think she feels?

154
00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:42.361
I don't know.

155
00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:43.380
I don't know what the fuck happened.

156
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.910
I got to stop smoking meth.

157
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.051
But instead,

158
00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:46.381
no,

159
00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:50.250
it's a fucking John Rhe there's like there's how many videos are there?

160
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

161
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.090
<v 3>I remember when like a long time ago I saw an important,</v>

162
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.080
like my first time that somebody spitting on the crotch before paying ne using

163
00:04:58.081 --> 00:04:59.030
it like a some spit lube.

164
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.810
I actually did it on Katie.

165
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.153
I

166
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.120
no guy wants that information out there spitting on her crotch.

167
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.170
She's fucking,

168
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.570
she got pissed off and then you should granted the bathroom and like washed her

169
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.660
and it didn't want to have sex.

170
00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:14.870
That would totally not horny at all.

171
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.490
You fucked up well there.

172
00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:17.120
Why?

173
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.250
I had a little chest cold so it might have something to do with,

174
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.240
oh,

175
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.240
<v 2>how dare you know stamps.com codeword jre save yourself some way.</v>

176
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.740
That's how you do a commercial bitch.

177
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.763
All right?

178
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.260
That's the only way I know.

179
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.770
Uh,

180
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.330
we're also brought to you by audible.com if you go to audible.com forward slash

181
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.140
Joe,

182
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.140
you can get one free audio book and 33 days of audible service.

183
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.640
If you've never used audible before,

184
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:52.110
it's a really fucking sweet service for looking for anything.

185
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.340
And people have said this to me,

186
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:54.690
like some guy said to me on Twitter,

187
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.920
he shouldn't,

188
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.490
uh,

189
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.100
advertise that people listen

190
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.410
<v 1>to a audio books when,</v>

191
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:00.740
uh,

192
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.360
when they're stuck in traffic because that's what we use.

193
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.240
Your podcast four,

194
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.310
that's like,

195
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.360
you're competing against yourself.

196
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:06.020
Like,

197
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.970
do you know any fucking people there are out there?

198
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.120
Do you know how many fucking people there are?

199
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:16.121
It's madness and water's going to go where it's supposed to go.

200
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.150
Okay?

201
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.340
It all gets the attention it deserves.

202
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.610
And if you want to read a fucking book on your transit,

203
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:24.140
you should not be listening to me.

204
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.251
If you,

205
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:26.150
if you decided,

206
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:26.391
you know,

207
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:28.010
I'm gonna use this time to educate myself.

208
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:28.251
Well,

209
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:29.810
I don't fit into that plan.

210
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.820
So I suggest if that's your meat,

211
00:06:32.821 --> 00:06:35.360
then you do use audible instead of this podcast.

212
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:36.680
How about them apples?

213
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.520
I think audio books are some of the coolest things that people have ever been

214
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:41.121
invented.

215
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:42.350
If you're a commuter,

216
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.071
you know,

217
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:45.680
cause it makes flying on a plane or in which is,

218
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:45.891
you know,

219
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:46.910
the same thing as podcasts.

220
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:47.480
Podcasts too.

221
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.021
And in fact,

222
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:49.040
a lot of podcasts,

223
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.520
uh,

224
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.590
one that I listened to a lot,

225
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.100
Dan Carlin's hardcore history,

226
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:53.780
you can get that on audible.

227
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.470
You can also get over 100,000 different books.

228
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.681
I mean,

229
00:06:57.681 --> 00:07:00.140
just an amazing collection of books,

230
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.010
uh,

231
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.050
as well as shows,

232
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.790
old radio shit podcast,

233
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.430
standup comedy specials,

234
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:08.031
uh,

235
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:10.160
just to the opiod Anthony show.

236
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.600
It's great.

237
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.590
It's beautiful service.

238
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.161
And,

239
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:13.520
uh,

240
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.941
like I said,

241
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:16.160
if you go to audible.com forward slash Joe,

242
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.260
you can try audible free for 30 days and you can get one free audio book.

243
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.310
<v 3>You know what's cool about it is,</v>

244
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:25.550
is like if you listen to a lot of podcasts that you need and instead just start

245
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:26.870
listening to audio books.

246
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.650
Uh,

247
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.060
when you're done listening to an audio book,

248
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:29.810
you can say,

249
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.740
I just read a book.

250
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.791
<v 1>You know what I mean?</v>

251
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:33.200
Like where when you listen to a podcast,

252
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.501
listen to podcast not to,

253
00:07:34.501 --> 00:07:35.870
so I have a radio.

254
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:39.440
I told you I'm a fucking in love with that Dan Carlin's hardcore history

255
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:40.041
podcast.

256
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:43.490
And even though you can't say you read a book after you get through one of

257
00:07:43.491 --> 00:07:43.910
those,

258
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.260
it's way better than reading a book.

259
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.120
It's super educational.

260
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.160
We can't quantify it like you kind of book.

261
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.121
But that,

262
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:51.890
that podcast is not just inspiration,

263
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:53.960
but that guy is a master storyteller.

264
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.230
So these fucking fascinating stories,

265
00:07:57.231 --> 00:07:57.501
man.

266
00:07:57.501 --> 00:07:58.790
It's really good stuff.

267
00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.601
That is awesome.

268
00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:02.330
And to think about him is that he's not a,

269
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.170
he always say,

270
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.291
oh,

271
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:04.520
I'm not really a historian.

272
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.850
He's way better than any historian because he,

273
00:08:06.851 --> 00:08:10.820
I can actually tell a story and he has no dog in the game.

274
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.000
He's there to try to discern the facts as clear as possible.

275
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.650
He gives several different accounts of each situation is it's been deciphered

276
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.300
what people agree on,

277
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.313
what,

278
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.831
you know,

279
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:25.220
as far as like numbers and how many killed and shit like that would really,

280
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:25.611
really,

281
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:26.090
really,

282
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.170
really interesting stuff,

283
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:28.004
man.

284
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.610
Um,

285
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.140
audible.com go check it out.

286
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.940
You can get Dan Carlin's hardcore history.

287
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.490
Do you any of any of your books do you have on audible yet?

288
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:34.800
You know,

289
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.360
I didn't know.

290
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.710
It pisses me off too sexy.

291
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.090
Your voice too sexy.

292
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.271
Cool.

293
00:08:39.271 --> 00:08:43.160
Is the old or the female population offered to turn lesbian since they cannot

294
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:45.020
possibly be satisfied by another man?

295
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.490
Old Man would be very sad.

296
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.720
I can't do that.

297
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.530
Or they can have men agreed to only make love to them while they're wearing

298
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.030
headphones listening to your voice.

299
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:53.893
That's right.

300
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.933
So it's,

301
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.191
well,

302
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:58.080
we need to get you to do one of those,

303
00:08:58.081 --> 00:08:59.190
cause that would be bad ass.

304
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.580
You know,

305
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.870
maybe you can just do it.

306
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.560
I mean,

307
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.320
um,

308
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.230
didn't Scottsville Sigler do that then?

309
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.041
Isn't that how we,

310
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:05.370
uh,

311
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:05.971
started out,

312
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:07.770
was it Scott Sigler who,

313
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:08.011
uh,

314
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:11.340
had all the podcasts that he released with all of his books?

315
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:12.174
The author.

316
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:12.571
Yeah.

317
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:16.890
I mean that guy became really popular by just releasing his,

318
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:17.160
uh,

319
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.520
his books and pop cap in podcast form Tony Solon.

320
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.151
Yeah.

321
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:21.931
He did it on a song.

322
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:24.120
He's a go getter dude.

323
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:24.301
You know,

324
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:25.600
it just was unhappy with the,

325
00:09:25.601 --> 00:09:27.270
the publishing world.

326
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:28.920
Like you're trying to deal with people,

327
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.221
you know,

328
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:30.360
maybe had a bad experience.

329
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:30.930
Right.

330
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.610
You can easily have a bad experience.

331
00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:34.030
Just the wrong publisher,

332
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.100
the wrong people,

333
00:09:35.101 --> 00:09:39.450
the wrong people with the wrong ideas of where you should go.

334
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.553
Yeah.

335
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:41.723
Um,

336
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:42.893
anyway,

337
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.003
go check it out.

338
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.250
Uh,

339
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.310
we're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com if you haven't been to on it

340
00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:47.790
lately.

341
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.380
We add a lot of shit on it.

342
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:54.381
Basically started off selling nutritional supplements like mostly a nootropics

343
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.120
like Alpha brain and shroom tech sport,

344
00:09:57.121 --> 00:10:01.560
which is an endurance enhancing supplement made out of a court accepts mushroom.

345
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.391
It's a real trippy thing.

346
00:10:02.391 --> 00:10:04.710
They actually grow these mushrooms on fucking caterpillars.

347
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:06.300
It's very strange stuff.

348
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:07.410
Yeah,

349
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.760
they apparently,

350
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:13.230
the story is the lore is that high altitude hurting populations,

351
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.750
they noticed that their cows,

352
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.120
their cattle were more active when they're eating this mushroom.

353
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.280
So they tried to figure out how to grow it and how to do it in process it in a

354
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:26.130
commercial way and it's also related to them.

355
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.440
That mushroom that fucks with ants,

356
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.800
it turns them into zombies that that is one of the weirdest like parasite

357
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:37.770
relationships in the animal world.

358
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.700
How does it work?

359
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.090
What does the court accepts is different strain of cordyceps.

360
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.040
Mushroom gets inside of the ant,

361
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.920
affects the aunt and when the other ants know it's infected,

362
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.050
they take him way out of town.

363
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:49.831
Like they're like,

364
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:53.910
we got to get him the fuck out of here because they know he becomes a bomb so

365
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.511
they,

366
00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:58.830
they have to take him out of town and then when they leave him there he explodes

367
00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:01.050
and sends mushroom spores into the air,

368
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.770
which I liked some invaders of the body snatchers type shit.

369
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.080
It just lands on other ants,

370
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.910
gets into them and fax them,

371
00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:10.470
takes them over and then the same thing,

372
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.370
they explode and become mushroom bombs.

373
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:15.690
Jesus Christ.

374
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:16.561
Yeah.

375
00:11:16.561 --> 00:11:17.070
What though?

376
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:17.903
<v 3>Fuck Dude.</v>

377
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:18.541
By the way,

378
00:11:18.541 --> 00:11:19.530
have you seen this part of your,

379
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:20.730
on its website?

380
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.590
What is it is all about lucid dreaming.

381
00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:26.760
It's one of the most amazing website I've ever that you just scroll down and

382
00:11:26.761 --> 00:11:28.380
it's all about lucid dreaming and there's like,

383
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:30.000
like these cool visuals that pop up.

384
00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:32.520
And then there's one point where like the whole space like starts spinning

385
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:33.354
around.

386
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.420
<v 1>Listen man,</v>

387
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.290
lucid dreaming.

388
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.490
I've had lucid dream experiences before but I've never had them as strong as

389
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:40.480
I've had them before.

390
00:11:40.481 --> 00:11:41.650
Taking Alpha brain.

391
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.360
That's a fact is,

392
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.220
and I think it's not just Alpha brain.

393
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.750
I think if you,

394
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.021
you know,

395
00:11:47.021 --> 00:11:47.631
you want to try it.

396
00:11:47.631 --> 00:11:50.570
I believe Coleen is one of the big ones responsible for it.

397
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.780
A lot of people have a report similar,

398
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:54.200
similar

399
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.700
<v 2>results and a,</v>

400
00:11:55.701 --> 00:11:59.630
I think that when you take things like that are psychoactive like that,

401
00:11:59.631 --> 00:11:59.901
like,

402
00:11:59.901 --> 00:12:00.560
um,

403
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.940
nootropics at night,

404
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:02.540
uh,

405
00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.720
I think it has a pretty profound effect on your dream state.

406
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.730
Lot of people have reported it.

407
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.280
I've always said that it's one of the most,

408
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:11.143
um,

409
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.730
one of the best pieces of evidence to the,

410
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.540
the efficacy of Alpha brain is what the fuck it does to your dreams.

411
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.150
It's hard to tell whether or not something's giving you an edge.

412
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.660
Like whether your brain is performing faster or slower cause it's all so

413
00:12:23.661 --> 00:12:24.321
subjective.

414
00:12:24.321 --> 00:12:28.780
It varies with how much sleep you've had or how annoyed you are at various was

415
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:29.150
so,

416
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.751
so much.

417
00:12:29.751 --> 00:12:33.350
But what Alpha brain provides is all the nutrients,

418
00:12:33.351 --> 00:12:36.320
all the building blocks for human truth.

419
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.290
What are you writing?

420
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.350
Fuckhead dreams,

421
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:38.990
man,

422
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:43.990
I was totally fucking my because are you putting that up online?

423
00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.230
Fucked my cousin.

424
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.831
So you,

425
00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:50.120
what you're doing is you're putting in a fake comment while we're doing a show.

426
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.010
You're putting on a fake comment,

427
00:12:52.011 --> 00:12:53.210
which you shouldn't do anyway.

428
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:55.721
<v 3>This website,</v>

429
00:12:55.721 --> 00:12:56.770
whoever made this website,

430
00:12:56.771 --> 00:12:57.071
Joe,

431
00:12:57.071 --> 00:12:57.611
you need to make,

432
00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:01.180
have him make your website because this is like breakthrough website

433
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.020
development.

434
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:02.560
Really.

435
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.550
This is amazing.

436
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.420
This is fun.

437
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.290
What's so amazing?

438
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.670
It's you can draw pictures.

439
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.471
Did you just see that thing?

440
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:09.380
I was scrolling through that.

441
00:13:09.381 --> 00:13:10.151
So cool.

442
00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:10.984
Oh

443
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:11.511
<v 2>yeah.</v>

444
00:13:11.511 --> 00:13:12.231
It's pretty interesting.

445
00:13:12.231 --> 00:13:13.064
You draw a deck

446
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:17.860
on,

447
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:18.860
good check out there.

448
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.430
We also did a little circle.

449
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.440
That's a fucking monster of a circumcision scar sign that someone's trying to

450
00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:25.274
stab your Dick.

451
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:26.130
One hair.

452
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:26.660
Okay,

453
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.493
stop.

454
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:28.250
Uh,

455
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.040
we also have a kettle bells battle ropes,

456
00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:33.500
all sorts of a strength of fitness equipment that we sell in there.

457
00:13:33.501 --> 00:13:34.040
Now,

458
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.730
if you use a codename Rogan and you'll save 10% off any and all supplements,

459
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:38.703
uh,

460
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.621
and so that's it.

461
00:13:39.621 --> 00:13:40.220
You Fox,

462
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.990
did you see that Yahoo knew was brought up,

463
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.211
uh,

464
00:13:42.211 --> 00:13:43.044
on Nick today?

465
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:43.431
No.

466
00:13:43.431 --> 00:13:44.680
What did they say they were,

467
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.140
they did that,

468
00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.870
these articles about Duane Ludwig and he would say,

469
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:48.561
now he,

470
00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:49.370
uh,

471
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:53.480
he reviews the fight tapes a not throw out then he's most Swedes.

472
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.840
And then human study left a review of the fight tapes when he's,

473
00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.400
when he's sticking out of her brain.

474
00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:00.170
And they were saying basically how he,

475
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.150
he feels like each time he,

476
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.570
each state of consciousness that you've reviewed the fights taping gives him a

477
00:14:05.571 --> 00:14:07.060
little bit differently for,

478
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:08.090
from the one before.

479
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.650
And of course Yahoo News being,

480
00:14:09.651 --> 00:14:09.960
you know,

481
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.940
Sini Carla and whatever.

482
00:14:10.941 --> 00:14:11.720
They're like,

483
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.291
yeah it is.

484
00:14:12.291 --> 00:14:15.910
But all dope dod they say makes you smarter and more acute.

485
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:16.820
Ya whatever.

486
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.010
That's very funny in your voice.

487
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.860
That's shitty paraphrase with your accent.

488
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.680
It's like she's crying.

489
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.400
It trains conversation.

490
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:26.000
Yeah.

491
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.833
You know,

492
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.580
things like Alpha brain of course.

493
00:14:28.581 --> 00:14:30.890
Anything that claims to make you smarter.

494
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.833
It sounds stupid.

495
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.350
I mean ironically,

496
00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.870
but there's absolutely been proven.

497
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.510
There's certain nutrients that enhance the way your brain functions.

498
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:39.920
I've tried a bunch of different ones.

499
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.880
Um,

500
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.930
I can't say enough.

501
00:14:41.931 --> 00:14:43.310
I don't give a fuck if you buy this.

502
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.300
This is my,

503
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.970
my best way to try to describe anything that we sell it on it.

504
00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.140
It's all shit I buy.

505
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.070
It's all shit

506
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.790
<v 1>I would buy.</v>

507
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:57.290
It's all shit that I endorsed because I've tried and I've had a positive benefit

508
00:14:57.291 --> 00:14:57.980
from it.

509
00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.590
All the nootropics,

510
00:14:59.600 --> 00:14:59.751
the,

511
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:01.490
the fitness supplements,

512
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.890
all the food like hemp force protein powder,

513
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.660
it's all shit that I would use.

514
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.680
It's all great stuff.

515
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.950
We try to give you the best shit we can find and at reasonable prices.

516
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.671
And again,

517
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:11.411
if you use a code name,

518
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:11.990
Rogan,

519
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.680
you save 10% off any supplements and you could fly bitch.

520
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:16.281
Yeah,

521
00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:17.960
I got to check into this lucid dream,

522
00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.620
um,

523
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.020
solve problems while we're starting to call

524
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.100
down with how to be done,

525
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:26.061
had to be done.

526
00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:27.350
There was not enough cults out there.

527
00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.110
They're making any sense it can be done correctly,

528
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:30.944
folks.

529
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:31.850
OK.

530
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:32.720
Dot Com code name,

531
00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:35.060
Rogan and go fuck yourself.

532
00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:35.630
All right.

533
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.600
Daniela [inaudible] is here and not just the name,

534
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:39.860
the way it rolls off the tongue.

535
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.020
It makes her stimulating conversation there.

536
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.750
One of the three people in the United States who can actually turn out and say

537
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.330
time.

538
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.210
Definitely time please my friend.

539
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.470
It's easy.

540
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.330
I'm a professional talker.

541
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:51.650
Hit.

542
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.260
It's on the Joe Rogan experience.

543
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.160
<v 4>Joe Rogan podcast by night.</v>

544
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:00.820
<v 1>Dan Yeley.</v>

545
00:16:00.821 --> 00:16:02.190
Bolelli mom,

546
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.033
man,

547
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:05.573
we'll be back.

548
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:07.960
Hey,

549
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.560
there we go.

550
00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.393
The um,

551
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:10.661
that the,

552
00:16:10.661 --> 00:16:13.240
does that sound of the Italian language man,

553
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.150
the Italians really figured out how to make shit sound good.

554
00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.350
Like to do was say in it.

555
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:17.711
Like,

556
00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:21.250
I was at Disneyland today and there's a couple that was talking next to us that

557
00:16:21.251 --> 00:16:26.251
was like clearly Italian [inaudible] another Da da.

558
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.520
Like it's uh,

559
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.320
like they're singing a little song.

560
00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:30.330
Like it sounds good.

561
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.920
<v 5>Oh,</v>

562
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.341
it's awesome.

563
00:16:32.341 --> 00:16:35.070
Because when I think about it is like I've been here 20 years and they still

564
00:16:35.071 --> 00:16:35.990
speak like a fob,

565
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.470
but because it's Italian fall,

566
00:16:37.471 --> 00:16:38.304
but then it's like,

567
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:38.800
Ooh,

568
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.830
resulted in European,

569
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:40.320
it's cool.

570
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.150
[inaudible] the doors open for me.

571
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.090
Whereas if I was bull Gary on or some shit,

572
00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:45.560
I would be,

573
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.240
we would be not trusting you and your problem.

574
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.470
Learn how to speak English right.

575
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:50.010
Already.

576
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:50.660
You sound like

577
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.510
<v 1>beautiful class assist or something.</v>

578
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.600
Some dude from a bygone time when men were elegant.

579
00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:57.350
Okay.

580
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.000
<v 5>And the number of times that I see,</v>

581
00:16:59.001 --> 00:17:02.240
I say sensing in the classroom when I realized my students are just looking at

582
00:17:02.241 --> 00:17:03.074
each other.

583
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:03.993
What did you say?

584
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.790
Like I did this for ever.

585
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.880
Nobody ever told the artist I worked with.

586
00:17:08.881 --> 00:17:09.730
Always use the word.

587
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.070
Um,

588
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.510
you know when I say sovereignty,

589
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:13.730
silver Ragaini team.

590
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:14.761
Oh No,

591
00:17:14.761 --> 00:17:15.170
it was really,

592
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:20.090
I never heard they tie all these studies a plus B so her regulate the sound

593
00:17:20.091 --> 00:17:20.840
about right.

594
00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.580
So I used it over and over again.

595
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:23.890
Nobody ever said anything.

596
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.110
Right.

597
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.120
So clearly nobody understood sheet of what I was saying.

598
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:27.890
And what they gelled was like,

599
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.460
are you trying to say solver?

600
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:31.371
So for Raggedy,

601
00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:31.521
yes.

602
00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:32.354
I was saying

603
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.030
I smoking vape with mine.

604
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:36.161
<v 1>Interesting.</v>

605
00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:38.640
When you're learning a language you need never in you,

606
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:42.490
you've never said words that are like fairly common room.

607
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.050
I sovereignty like I have a few,

608
00:17:44.051 --> 00:17:46.280
there's a few that occasionally like I don't,

609
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:50.160
I can't think of any off the cuff but I know there's some where I've only read

610
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.371
<v 2>them,</v>

611
00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:51.450
I've never said them.

612
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:52.800
And then when someone says him I'm like,

613
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:53.634
which one is that?

614
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.120
Is that the silent Gyn?

615
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.033
Huh?

616
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.270
Cause that's how it sounds.

617
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.160
Wow.

618
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.210
He does a few like wall law,

619
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:01.621
the for,

620
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:03.540
I remember I read it on a software script.

621
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:03.910
I was like,

622
00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:04.860
Viola,

623
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:05.740
like view Wah,

624
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:06.750
Wah,

625
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.381
Wah La,

626
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:08.214
you know,

627
00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:09.840
French,

628
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.171
French.

629
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:10.591
Is that right?

630
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:11.081
Impulse bossy.

631
00:18:11.081 --> 00:18:11.401
Always like,

632
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:11.501
yeah,

633
00:18:11.501 --> 00:18:15.040
but I mean it's somehow or another it is in English script write stuff down.

634
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:15.871
So sometimes you have to,

635
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:17.640
I have to say it in a on a TV show.

636
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.320
I didn't know.

637
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.320
I didn't know and I was like,

638
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.370
oh it's while La,

639
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:20.820
right?

640
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.810
I thought it was a w,

641
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:22.920
Travelocity.

642
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.420
I always get that velocity.

643
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.080
No it seamless.

644
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.980
That's fairly simple.

645
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.890
You should go to the doctor checked out.

646
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.450
But Italian man,

647
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.000
what is it about the Italian culture?

648
00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:41.210
Because Italians like are known for first of all like very delicious foods like

649
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.531
delicious,

650
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:44.191
rich,

651
00:18:44.191 --> 00:18:45.024
fatty,

652
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.130
incredibly good food,

653
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:52.131
great wine and know for great one art and for being very passionate.

654
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.440
And they all have that crazy way of talking but been anybody.

655
00:18:56.441 --> 00:18:57.390
But if the judge is like,

656
00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:58.390
it's like an art to,

657
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.120
to even communicate it,

658
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.580
it's more when I go back,

659
00:19:02.581 --> 00:19:06.240
I have to retrain myself cause people first,

660
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.590
nobody ever eat,

661
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:11.040
finish a conversation and let the other person begin to speak is you're

662
00:19:11.041 --> 00:19:12.540
constantly going to interrupt each other.

663
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:13.681
So it's like that.

664
00:19:13.681 --> 00:19:14.514
Just the norm.

665
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.260
You're not used to it anymore.

666
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:16.740
So you're like,

667
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.041
oh,

668
00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:18.720
I guess it's your door that he's like,

669
00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:19.530
there's no such thing.

670
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.350
You know you're turning my tribe is,

671
00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:26.970
you'll be 30 CPO to begin to talk taking these gigantic deep breath.

672
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.410
Go ahead.

673
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:30.660
And then we went this man,

674
00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:33.600
I know it's like indeed God for 10 minutes straight and you're like,

675
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:34.640
Jesus Christ.

676
00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:34.970
Really?

677
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.120
Do you have all of those and many words in your mouth?

678
00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.480
That's insane.

679
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.350
Yes.

680
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.100
I got this photo on my wall and it's from a,

681
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.380
it's an American girl in in Italy.

682
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.280
It's like 1950 something and there's chickens walked down the street and these

683
00:19:50.281 --> 00:19:52.290
dudes grabbing their dicks and like,

684
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:53.783
it's like,

685
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.331
like what?

686
00:19:54.331 --> 00:19:54.780
You didn't,

687
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:55.710
I didn't expect this.

688
00:19:55.711 --> 00:19:56.730
People did that.

689
00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.910
I thought that was like more of a,

690
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:00.330
you know,

691
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.590
Jersey shore type thing.

692
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:01.960
You know?

693
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.360
More of a more recent thing,

694
00:20:03.361 --> 00:20:03.760
but no,

695
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:03.931
no,

696
00:20:03.931 --> 00:20:04.310
no.

697
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.070
That creepy dudes have been around since the beginning of time.

698
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.280
Since students are created this picture from Italy in 1919 fucking 50 something

699
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.830
I heard somewhere day there were scenes,

700
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.940
particularly northern Europeans who,

701
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.240
you know,

702
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.320
they do many things right.

703
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.290
But definitely the romance department is not the one that they are most.

704
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:23.124
There are now four.

705
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.211
No a lot.

706
00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:25.280
They're not known for Roman.

707
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.011
Exactly.

708
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:30.710
So a lot of the women come down for a vacation in Italy to hookup for a random

709
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.711
summer.

710
00:20:30.711 --> 00:20:32.750
Flings exalted.

711
00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:33.031
You could,

712
00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:33.421
oh man,

713
00:20:33.421 --> 00:20:37.200
two key thallium story and then they go back to their regular life.

714
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.380
So who would be the boring like dudes from,

715
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.570
barring is a bad word.

716
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.050
I've got to have a lots of people fly.

717
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.540
But you know they got the reputation for being a little bit on the call and the

718
00:20:47.541 --> 00:20:48.610
selling Norway,

719
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:49.961
Norway,

720
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:51.400
Sweden and even Germany.

721
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.990
That's that rep cold.

722
00:20:52.991 --> 00:20:57.730
People that are very disciplined and Trump might not be so good at eating pussy

723
00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:58.970
basically.

724
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:59.440
Right.

725
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.130
They are going to do it.

726
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.370
You know they are going to make awesome cars are going to run.

727
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:02.851
They call him,

728
00:21:02.851 --> 00:21:02.970
he,

729
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.920
I eight today we're going to do all the things that Italian can't even begin to

730
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:06.790
know where to start.

731
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.031
You know,

732
00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:07.630
they do the cars.

733
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.841
Okay.

734
00:21:07.841 --> 00:21:09.820
But not definitely not the economy part,

735
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.800
but when it comes to romance,

736
00:21:11.801 --> 00:21:11.981
yeah,

737
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:12.814
not quite.

738
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.400
That muscle hasn't been this command.

739
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.130
In order to have a certain amount of fun in the conversation,

740
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.470
there has to be that I don't give a fuck element.

741
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.790
And there's very few like really conservative people that know how to turn that

742
00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:25.330
part on.

743
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:25.930
Right.

744
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.460
They never know how to not give a fuck.

745
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.340
They don't never know when it's important to not give a phone.

746
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.580
But it's often important to not give a fuck for fun.

747
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.690
Passion for,

748
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:35.920
for partying,

749
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:36.221
for,

750
00:21:36.221 --> 00:21:36.521
you know,

751
00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:37.301
just to Jay,

752
00:21:37.301 --> 00:21:38.530
laugh with your friends.

753
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.850
And if you can't do that,

754
00:21:39.851 --> 00:21:40.900
if you can't let that go,

755
00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:44.830
you tightly knit and figuring out how to fucking use gears and leavers in order

756
00:21:44.831 --> 00:21:46.210
to make a car worth better.

757
00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.700
That's old time is work,

758
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:49.660
you know,

759
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.381
after a while,

760
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:50.740
man.

761
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:50.861
Yeah.

762
00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:51.641
Even the language.

763
00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:55.240
I mean you tried to say sweet and lovable in Germany.

764
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.253
Yeah.

765
00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.650
That was one of the craziest things about Hitler speech.

766
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:02.020
It wasn't just what he was saying was fucked up.

767
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:03.520
It was that crazy ass,

768
00:22:03.521 --> 00:22:04.031
the language.

769
00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:07.210
He was saying it in this like really alien,

770
00:22:07.211 --> 00:22:08.350
angry,

771
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:08.801
you know,

772
00:22:08.801 --> 00:22:13.801
to be an American in the 1940s like when all this was going on and to see that

773
00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:14.981
guy,

774
00:22:14.981 --> 00:22:16.660
I guess they saw him in movie theaters,

775
00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:16.871
right?

776
00:22:16.871 --> 00:22:17.890
And that's how they would see that.

777
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:18.881
See that guy,

778
00:22:18.881 --> 00:22:21.610
he's screaming at the top of his lungs,

779
00:22:21.611 --> 00:22:26.350
that crazy fucking mustache in that weird language that you didn't understand

780
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.300
that it had to be.

781
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.470
God Damn terrifies here lately man.

782
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.970
Cause you'll see the videos and you see thousands of people standing totally

783
00:22:33.971 --> 00:22:34.630
disciplined.

784
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:35.140
These stunning,

785
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.800
complete silence to the guy going crazy and don't finish the sentence that you

786
00:22:38.801 --> 00:22:40.930
all jump up with one child.

787
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:41.783
Wow.

788
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:42.880
It's insane.

789
00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.290
But he seen the men that get to that position,

790
00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:47.560
that,

791
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.060
that crazy position where they can talk a whole gang of people and they're doing

792
00:22:52.061 --> 00:22:52.781
something really,

793
00:22:52.781 --> 00:22:56.170
really bad and everybody's discipline and everybody's along with them.

794
00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.500
That's one of those were some of the scariest moments in all of history when

795
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.640
some group or leader with nefarious intentions is like super charismatic,

796
00:23:07.721 --> 00:23:12.340
super driven and super insane altogether and in control.

797
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.190
That's possible.

798
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.550
I would just coming over here,

799
00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:16.620
I was a at stunning two.

800
00:23:16.621 --> 00:23:20.320
I've done card inside his own to the latest a hardcore case study and he was

801
00:23:20.321 --> 00:23:23.920
going off about the story about what was happening in Germany into 59 that has,

802
00:23:23.921 --> 00:23:24.680
yes,

803
00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.080
it has like the three ps.

804
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.730
We are the story ever.

805
00:23:27.731 --> 00:23:28.564
It's amazing.

806
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.230
It's,

807
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.740
yeah,

808
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:34.740
it's I guess it's origins of Lutheranism and what he's talking about was,

809
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:39.340
I did not know this and this is one of the amazing things about that podcast I

810
00:23:39.341 --> 00:23:42.580
did not know that most people couldn't read.

811
00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:46.220
The Bible is recently as 1500 that

812
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.080
<v 5>span lt offense in most countries.</v>

813
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.040
If you are ready to buy,

814
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.510
if you own your own Bible,

815
00:23:50.511 --> 00:23:52.190
you read the Bible by yourself,

816
00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:53.930
not in laughing through the priest,

817
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.321
by you.

818
00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:55.610
Instead you had your own thing.

819
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:56.870
You could be put to that.

820
00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:59.900
That's insane because if you read it on your own,

821
00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:04.240
you'll make a weird ideas and then you would a walked her down the throat and me

822
00:24:04.241 --> 00:24:06.080
sequence through goals ward.

823
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:07.850
That's not that long ago.

824
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.713
No,

825
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.140
that's not even a thousand years ago.

826
00:24:12.141 --> 00:24:12.710
Yeah,

827
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:13.880
it's so crazy.

828
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.370
But that's the thing that makes you one that about human beings,

829
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.720
that device,

830
00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:21.220
majority of human beings just go with the program of whatever they are tilting

831
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.150
those times and when you look at that,

832
00:24:23.151 --> 00:24:27.260
like even if you look back 70 years and you look at racism in the United States,

833
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.940
anybody went along with the norm of what was tp called the medic on society 70

834
00:24:31.941 --> 00:24:32.421
years ago.

835
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:37.250
It would be seen as like batshit crazy today and yet back then,

836
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.390
you know there were plenty of people against it but they were the minority.

837
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.920
The majority of people were like,

838
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:45.650
yeah of course it does die and people of color and that I heard,

839
00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:46.484
I was like,

840
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.020
it's weird.

841
00:24:48.021 --> 00:24:52.550
It's like people that are donkey's being trained with the carrot and the stick

842
00:24:52.551 --> 00:24:54.320
since they are barn and they just go into PR,

843
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.190
they don't question or shit.

844
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.241
<v 1>Well people,</v>

845
00:24:56.241 --> 00:25:00.710
it's super easy for people to believe some crazy shit as long as the people

846
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:02.180
around you believe crazy shit as well.

847
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.900
Exactly.

848
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:07.900
We have a real problem like that where we can get sucked into our atmosphere and

849
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.230
you,

850
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:14.090
especially if you are a an easily led person or a person who doesn't have like a

851
00:25:14.091 --> 00:25:16.880
really fully formed opinion of the world.

852
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.290
I mean that's one of the one things they do to people when they torture him and

853
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.400
say they take away your view of the world.

854
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:23.160
They take away though,

855
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.180
they'd take away your ability to look at things rationally and then when they

856
00:25:26.181 --> 00:25:27.020
start talking to you,

857
00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:28.790
it's like now they're your friends.

858
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:30.920
Like it says that Stockholm Syndrome,

859
00:25:30.921 --> 00:25:31.131
right?

860
00:25:31.131 --> 00:25:32.270
When they kidnap people,

861
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:34.730
the kidnapper becomes someone who you love,

862
00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:34.911
you,

863
00:25:34.911 --> 00:25:35.541
you give in,

864
00:25:35.541 --> 00:25:36.374
you relent,

865
00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:37.311
you know.

866
00:25:37.311 --> 00:25:39.050
And that's why they,

867
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.270
that's why that in that homeland show,

868
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.920
like that concept works,

869
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.920
that they'd kidnap these guys and turn them into suicide bond,

870
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:47.150
these American Gis,

871
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:51.440
which is pretty creepy fucking premise and scary premise.

872
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:56.890
But the idea is that like people change if you change their environment

873
00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:58.460
<v 5>like big time.</v>

874
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.960
The thing,

875
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.470
that's why to me the healthiest thing anybody can do about anything east

876
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.390
requests every single hour totes.

877
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.180
Not because you are like a pain in the ass teenager.

878
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:11.520
We just want to be different for the hell of being different just because

879
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.630
precisely if you value something you should question it.

880
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.970
It's the same thing as like when you say on the [inaudible] you tried them,

881
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.060
you check it out for yourself if you work.

882
00:26:22.061 --> 00:26:22.641
So you go for it.

883
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:23.181
If it doesn't,

884
00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:25.520
you don't is it has to be by direct experience.

885
00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.300
Otherwise he should start going by the shit that other people tell you.

886
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.351
And,

887
00:26:30.351 --> 00:26:30.650
uh,

888
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:35.240
it's about belief and going on fate almost out of faculty to know anyway.

889
00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.860
<v 1>The real problem with that is that should be the way we do it.</v>

890
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.420
We should go on other people.

891
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:43.380
The problem is there's too many diamonds there.

892
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:43.980
There's

893
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.010
<v 2>too many people out there that don't know what the fuck was going on in their</v>

894
00:26:47.011 --> 00:26:50.280
own life and they can't give you advice and they can't give you an honest

895
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:53.100
assessment of whether something works or doesn't work as good or it's not good.

896
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:53.993
Right?

897
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.620
But that should be the way we go on it.

898
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.903
And it should be.

899
00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.060
It should be that we can completely trust everybody.

900
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:00.901
You know,

901
00:27:00.901 --> 00:27:04.080
if we could figure out how to eliminate deception,

902
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.130
that would be one of the best things ever for the human race.

903
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.630
If we could figure out how to eliminate like the,

904
00:27:11.631 --> 00:27:13.800
the need to steal and deception,

905
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.540
those just to those two things alone.

906
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:15.790
Yeah.

907
00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:16.650
Good luck with [inaudible].

908
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.370
I know.

909
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.170
Earn what you deserve,

910
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:19.800
you know,

911
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.730
earn what you deserve,

912
00:27:20.731 --> 00:27:21.150
right?

913
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:22.890
And don't deceive to get there.

914
00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:23.850
Don't lie.

915
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.670
Right?

916
00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:28.260
Whether it's in business or in your personal life,

917
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.340
your friendships.

918
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.370
And when we figure that out,

919
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.650
that's going to be gigantic cause it's really,

920
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.160
that's one of the beauties when people start talking about psychedelics helping

921
00:27:38.161 --> 00:27:38.890
people,

922
00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:43.530
the be one of the beautiful things is that it eliminates the ego and the ego is

923
00:27:43.531 --> 00:27:45.930
the one that's locked in you and all that stupid shit,

924
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:46.913
right?

925
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.910
The Ego is locking you into your past experiences.

926
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.180
The Ego's locking you into your idea who you are.

927
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:55.980
And that's,

928
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.440
that's the kind of shit that allows people to do creepy things.

929
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.960
That's what allows people to steal and to see eve and you know,

930
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:05.350
use trickery and the,

931
00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:06.184
that's the,

932
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.660
that's someone who's like your ego's allowing you to do that.

933
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.471
Like your,

934
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:13.020
your sense of humanity and justice and what would you,

935
00:28:13.021 --> 00:28:14.670
how would you want the world to behave?

936
00:28:14.671 --> 00:28:17.010
What if everyone's like that by doing it yourself?

937
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:20.190
Are you giving the green light for everyone to just go straight pirate?

938
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.610
Right.

939
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.210
Do you know how much,

940
00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.840
how hard human beings have worked for so fucking long to get ourselves to a

941
00:28:24.841 --> 00:28:29.520
position where we can walk down the street and almost every city in the country

942
00:28:29.521 --> 00:28:33.540
and be reasonably safe when you're driving and you can be reasonably safe

943
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.060
despite the fact that you're dealing with millions and millions and millions of

944
00:28:36.061 --> 00:28:36.530
people.

945
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:36.651
Well,

946
00:28:36.651 --> 00:28:37.680
when you go rogue,

947
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.491
you know you,

948
00:28:38.491 --> 00:28:42.290
you conduct this whole awesome system that everybody's been busting their ass.

949
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.990
Big Time to me is weird because my relationship with the low,

950
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:48.090
I guess is I break the law.

951
00:28:48.091 --> 00:28:51.330
That's the law for thanks for her to translation.

952
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:52.283
Very good.

953
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:52.801
The little,

954
00:28:52.801 --> 00:28:53.634
as I was saying,

955
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.700
had to so many fucking words.

956
00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:57.534
I can say

957
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:02.910
there are lots of lows.

958
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:04.890
I break on a fairly regular basis,

959
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:05.753
but my,

960
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:10.110
I guess moral stand standpoint on that is anything,

961
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.730
anything I do,

962
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.290
whether legal or illegal,

963
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.800
the end result can't be hurting another human being.

964
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:20.550
If anybody walked home crying because of something that I did is fuck it up,

965
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:21.441
you find,

966
00:29:21.441 --> 00:29:23.880
but it came to those that don't really hurt another human being.

967
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:26.130
There's not one person who is going to shed a tear over it,

968
00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:27.850
then I have no problem with it.

969
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.100
Well,

970
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.020
I agree with that.

971
00:29:30.021 --> 00:29:33.270
If you're like run a red light three in the morning when there's no one around.

972
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:34.320
I agree with that.

973
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:34.800
Right?

974
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.840
But I think even if,

975
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:41.890
if certain laws like like financial laws,

976
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.150
there was a reason why people are willing to steal things from their,

977
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.840
their job and people were willing to lie about their taxes when people,

978
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.560
and one of the reasons is that regular people,

979
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:58.060
people who are worried about their money and scratch and scrape and save for

980
00:29:58.061 --> 00:29:58.811
vacations,

981
00:29:58.811 --> 00:29:59.860
if they ever get a vacation,

982
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.400
regular people see the type of shit that goes on on Wall Street.

983
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:08.230
They see like those houses in the Hamptons on those TV shows and those,

984
00:30:08.231 --> 00:30:09.730
those crazy places in Greenwich,

985
00:30:09.731 --> 00:30:13.750
Connecticut where these people have fucking airports and their backyard and

986
00:30:13.751 --> 00:30:18.130
helicopter landing pads in the middle of their polo field.

987
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:18.560
You know,

988
00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.600
it's insane money.

989
00:30:19.601 --> 00:30:23.380
You're talking about people who have hundreds and hundreds of millions of

990
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:23.381
dollars,

991
00:30:23.381 --> 00:30:24.101
so many of them.

992
00:30:24.101 --> 00:30:24.560
And what,

993
00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.510
what do they offer?

994
00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:26.344
What did they do?

995
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.210
While they're in the financial business,

996
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.340
they move numbers around.

997
00:30:30.341 --> 00:30:32.860
They figured out a way to extract money from the system.

998
00:30:32.861 --> 00:30:33.694
That's what they do.

999
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.130
They get really good at extracting money from the system.

1000
00:30:36.131 --> 00:30:38.500
And the best piece of evidence is what's in front of them.

1001
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:38.710
Right?

1002
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:40.150
What exactly do you do?

1003
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:41.640
You move numbers,

1004
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:42.281
you buy,

1005
00:30:42.281 --> 00:30:42.821
you sell,

1006
00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:43.251
you do this,

1007
00:30:43.251 --> 00:30:43.690
you that.

1008
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:47.550
How the fuck have you acquired the amount of wealth that you need to,

1009
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.200
to own a gigantic compound in Greenwich,

1010
00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:50.690
Connecticut.

1011
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.630
What benefit have you given?

1012
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.160
What have you done there?

1013
00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:54.761
What have you done?

1014
00:30:54.761 --> 00:30:56.410
You've extracted money from the system.

1015
00:30:56.411 --> 00:30:57.244
That's what you've done.

1016
00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.960
Whether it's legal or illegal,

1017
00:30:58.961 --> 00:30:59.530
the uh,

1018
00:30:59.530 --> 00:30:59.780
the,

1019
00:30:59.780 --> 00:30:59.950
the,

1020
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.210
it's the same shit because you know,

1021
00:31:01.211 --> 00:31:04.630
the laws that are in place are only in place because somebody bribed somebody

1022
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:05.710
and that's a fact.

1023
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:09.730
Somebody you special interest money to make something happen somewhere that

1024
00:31:09.731 --> 00:31:13.000
somebody liked that somebody passed that law and got things through.

1025
00:31:13.001 --> 00:31:13.780
And that's how,

1026
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.520
that's how the system is set up the way it is.

1027
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.270
Yeah.

1028
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:16.601
That's how,

1029
00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:16.871
I mean,

1030
00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:18.520
if you're going to be in the game anyway,

1031
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:19.181
Dan,

1032
00:31:19.181 --> 00:31:19.931
I have no problem.

1033
00:31:19.931 --> 00:31:20.920
But they cane syrup and lows,

1034
00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:22.210
but I don't break my own lows.

1035
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:22.851
You know what I mean?

1036
00:31:22.851 --> 00:31:23.730
It's social loads.

1037
00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:24.250
Fuck it.

1038
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:24.880
Whatever.

1039
00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.290
As long as by my stock.

1040
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.820
The problem is when people,

1041
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:33.150
when people stop being goody goody and go by the book to fucking booty goodies.

1042
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.093
Okay.

1043
00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:37.810
They at bet [inaudible] they uh,

1044
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:38.890
they just go nuts.

1045
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:39.281
Right?

1046
00:31:39.281 --> 00:31:40.460
So it's like he's not just,

1047
00:31:40.461 --> 00:31:44.770
the date is likely break a few lows because those laws don't make sense is they

1048
00:31:44.771 --> 00:31:48.630
go all out and do the rape and pillage and whatever the fight or day out or

1049
00:31:48.631 --> 00:31:50.350
these goody goody for the eggs to are.

1050
00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.480
And both of them don't.

1051
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:52.780
I mean,

1052
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.430
I prefer the one that's not going to shoot you at 3:00 AM,

1053
00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.830
but at the end of the day they bought our stock in this dogmatic view offered a

1054
00:31:58.831 --> 00:32:00.430
word about how it's supposed to be.

1055
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.481
And to me,

1056
00:32:01.481 --> 00:32:02.770
once you break clothes,

1057
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.521
you have to be,

1058
00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:07.000
there's a Bob Dylan line in one of his songs that he say to leave outside the

1059
00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:07.201
law.

1060
00:32:07.201 --> 00:32:08.170
You must be honest,

1061
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:09.420
which just sounded like it buyer paradox,

1062
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:09.741
right?

1063
00:32:09.741 --> 00:32:11.020
Because it's saying what the fuck are you mean?

1064
00:32:11.021 --> 00:32:14.500
Like I already going to be honest with a better King Louis and he really is

1065
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:15.430
unique to be,

1066
00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.290
otherwise you're turn into some fuck it up.

1067
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:17.970
Could he mean?

1068
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:18.450
Uh,

1069
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:19.510
but if you're going to do it,

1070
00:32:19.511 --> 00:32:21.750
you need to have some three TC or use,

1071
00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:22.760
uh,

1072
00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.730
Morrell safeguard that you have on your own.

1073
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:29.290
Then you don't need any God or call to catch you to make you not do it is you

1074
00:32:29.291 --> 00:32:31.960
don't do certain things because they are fucked up period and you are just not

1075
00:32:31.961 --> 00:32:32.381
going to do it.

1076
00:32:32.381 --> 00:32:32.950
Cause it's such,

1077
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:33.880
what's the inside of you?

1078
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.410
That's a very romantic notion,

1079
00:32:35.411 --> 00:32:35.581
man.

1080
00:32:35.581 --> 00:32:37.120
That's like a fucking clinics Eastwood movie.

1081
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.381
You know,

1082
00:32:38.381 --> 00:32:40.390
it is a romantic notion of the,

1083
00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:40.611
the,

1084
00:32:40.611 --> 00:32:43.550
the ethics of being an outlaw outlaw ethics.

1085
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.440
I realize a few days ago I was,

1086
00:32:45.441 --> 00:32:45.860
uh,

1087
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:46.400
I was,

1088
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.031
you don't want to like,

1089
00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:50.890
Facebook has the sig like inspirational people or shit like that play in.

1090
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:51.890
You throw down some names.

1091
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.290
I realize I put down Robin Hood to twice.

1092
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:59.150
I was like shit really twice that impart that to me at different point in time.

1093
00:32:59.150 --> 00:32:59.871
I'm like okay,

1094
00:32:59.871 --> 00:33:03.440
I see it back there near and I didn't know that Robin Hood was initially about

1095
00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:04.274
poaching.

1096
00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.080
Yeah.

1097
00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:05.960
It's about food.

1098
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.250
Right.

1099
00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.450
Cause they didn't let her hand,

1100
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.400
they wouldn't let the poor hunt on the land.

1101
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.421
So these poor,

1102
00:33:11.421 --> 00:33:15.590
they have no money and no food and they started shooting deer in Robin hood

1103
00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:17.570
would shoot these deer and give them to poor people.

1104
00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.513
Yup.

1105
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:24.870
Such silly matches the fact that king's ever worked at that ever worked that

1106
00:33:25.641 --> 00:33:29.580
anybody was ever willing to like admit your grace royalty.

1107
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.920
You know,

1108
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.760
that's one of the beautiful things about that.

1109
00:33:31.761 --> 00:33:33.410
And I know it's a fantasy novel,

1110
00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:34.244
but um,

1111
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:34.880
uh,

1112
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.400
game of Thrones is the way the communicate with each other,

1113
00:33:37.401 --> 00:33:41.030
the way the royals like have this secret guarded way of communicating with each

1114
00:33:41.031 --> 00:33:41.241
other.

1115
00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:42.820
But the actors are so good that he's like,

1116
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.880
the intention is like very clear throughout everything and they have,

1117
00:33:46.881 --> 00:33:50.450
it's very proper way of handling and managing every situation.

1118
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:51.770
It's so fascinating.

1119
00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:52.910
That show is awesome.

1120
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.690
It's so that royal blood thing is such a trip and I again,

1121
00:33:56.691 --> 00:33:59.450
I know that this is just a TV show that's bullshit.

1122
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.070
They got dragons and stuff.

1123
00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:01.731
You know,

1124
00:34:01.731 --> 00:34:02.240
it's not,

1125
00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.440
there's no reality,

1126
00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:04.700
but no,

1127
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.540
the Aclu is really,

1128
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:10.630
that idealistic way of communicating did exist at least in small places.

1129
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:13.220
In small pockets for quite a while.

1130
00:34:13.221 --> 00:34:14.040
Right?

1131
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:14.501
Absolutely.

1132
00:34:14.501 --> 00:34:18.200
But the thing is not only why we to volts,

1133
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:22.310
that part is actually the coolest part about it is how it devolves that one day

1134
00:34:22.311 --> 00:34:23.570
some guy shows up and say,

1135
00:34:23.571 --> 00:34:24.404
you know a lot of,

1136
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:25.650
I'm going to be your keen.

1137
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:30.920
You'd call me Your Majesty and he's not because God wants it to be that way.

1138
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.210
And I mean if I go do that around today,

1139
00:34:35.211 --> 00:34:36.770
I probably don't have such success.

1140
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:37.521
How to fuck it.

1141
00:34:37.521 --> 00:34:38.780
If people go along with that,

1142
00:34:38.781 --> 00:34:39.680
it's just amazing.

1143
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.280
It's,

1144
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.150
I don't know it.

1145
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:46.160
Do you think that being a king and that that kind of thing comes from the

1146
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:51.640
original Alpha male primate behavior that that chimps exhibit and monkeys

1147
00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:55.340
exhibit where there's one that's always the alpha.

1148
00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.520
So almost like we have this weird broken need to have that one.

1149
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.300
So we go,

1150
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.260
we go looking for it.

1151
00:35:03.261 --> 00:35:04.430
Whether it's right,

1152
00:35:04.431 --> 00:35:07.420
whether it's a king or a priest or a,

1153
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:07.710
you know,

1154
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:08.220
whatever.

1155
00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.490
Whoever there's a one or you know,

1156
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:11.630
could it be that way?

1157
00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:14.060
Could also be and one doesn't exclude.

1158
00:35:14.061 --> 00:35:17.240
The other back would also be like in hunting and gathering societies,

1159
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.150
which is how we have lived the majority of time we've been around.

1160
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.090
You have to kind of have these informed my leadership because there's only like

1161
00:35:23.091 --> 00:35:25.610
2030 people I have known each other their life.

1162
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.800
So when there's a decision to be made,

1163
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.630
everybody turned to you because you are cool.

1164
00:35:29.631 --> 00:35:30.171
They are smart.

1165
00:35:30.171 --> 00:35:31.610
Last time you'll give us good advice.

1166
00:35:31.611 --> 00:35:33.020
You want to have real power.

1167
00:35:33.021 --> 00:35:36.650
But when you sat down and you started eating farming income,

1168
00:35:36.651 --> 00:35:38.020
you only under 30 people

1169
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:43.020
<v 5>become 300 and then they'll come 3000 there's a lot more of those little in</v>

1170
00:35:43.851 --> 00:35:44.684
their fights.

1171
00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:45.010
You know,

1172
00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.100
people within the tribe would start fighting each other and so you need the

1173
00:35:48.101 --> 00:35:52.420
leader to come mediate cause he's a cool guy but it stops being OER.

1174
00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.410
Nice guy.

1175
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:54.940
You do that once in a while.

1176
00:35:54.941 --> 00:35:59.100
It becomes a full time job and it becomes so important to keep the society to

1177
00:35:59.101 --> 00:36:00.960
gather and make sure that people don't kill each other.

1178
00:36:00.961 --> 00:36:01.794
And it's like you know what?

1179
00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.580
Stop planting your fields.

1180
00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:04.540
Don't worry about that.

1181
00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:08.350
We understand that it's a pain in the ass for you to constantly be having to

1182
00:36:08.351 --> 00:36:09.940
worry about our little squabbles.

1183
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
But it's such an important job we'll plant for you.

1184
00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:13.511
You know,

1185
00:36:13.511 --> 00:36:15.650
and suddenly there's a division of social class.

1186
00:36:15.651 --> 00:36:18.760
It's where suddenly somebody is a specialized job or that emerge.

1187
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:22.030
Maybe because they are cold people maybe starts out at people give them that

1188
00:36:22.031 --> 00:36:22.460
power,

1189
00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.080
right?

1190
00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:23.531
Hey man,

1191
00:36:23.531 --> 00:36:24.610
you got to read these mites.

1192
00:36:24.611 --> 00:36:26.200
You can always solve the problem.

1193
00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:31.270
And then would it be Gerda society gets the more to social stratification.

1194
00:36:31.271 --> 00:36:33.850
The Morton that position become entrenched,

1195
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.331
saw,

1196
00:36:34.331 --> 00:36:36.780
they'd unquestionable the passes to their kids.

1197
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:38.140
So kings divide,

1198
00:36:38.141 --> 00:36:38.411
right?

1199
00:36:38.411 --> 00:36:39.100
All of that shit.

1200
00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:40.810
But partly the way it starts,

1201
00:36:40.811 --> 00:36:42.580
it starts in a mad little normal way.

1202
00:36:42.581 --> 00:36:43.360
Like,

1203
00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:43.871
Oh man,

1204
00:36:43.871 --> 00:36:44.740
you're a cool guy.

1205
00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:46.330
You give good advice,

1206
00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.190
please us mediate.

1207
00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:49.300
You know,

1208
00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.080
and the more the need for mediation increases,

1209
00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.040
the bigger,

1210
00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:58.900
the more important their role becomes until it becomes something above and

1211
00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:00.610
separate from everybody else's.

1212
00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.310
And he's now the leadership by charisma anymore.

1213
00:37:03.311 --> 00:37:05.890
It becomes leadership by Bert or some shit

1214
00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:06.671
<v 2>by right.</v>

1215
00:37:06.671 --> 00:37:07.780
By divine right.

1216
00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.230
By enforcement of the group of people that agrees with you.

1217
00:37:11.231 --> 00:37:13.390
And then you divvy up power within the group.

1218
00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:13.960
Yup.

1219
00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.231
Yeah.

1220
00:37:14.231 --> 00:37:15.070
It's madness.

1221
00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:15.311
It's a,

1222
00:37:15.311 --> 00:37:18.130
it's amazing that it existed as the norm though.

1223
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:22.990
What's amazing is that it's not just that in one place a king was born right and

1224
00:37:22.991 --> 00:37:23.890
they had a king and wow,

1225
00:37:23.891 --> 00:37:24.491
this is crazy.

1226
00:37:24.491 --> 00:37:25.450
How did they do at King thing?

1227
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:26.750
Nobody else would agree with that.

1228
00:37:26.751 --> 00:37:26.920
Yeah,

1229
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.040
no,

1230
00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:27.340
it,

1231
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.300
everybody agreed to it.

1232
00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:29.620
They agreed to it all over the world.

1233
00:37:29.621 --> 00:37:30.180
Yeah.

1234
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.260
It's the green to the emperor in China.

1235
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:33.850
They had an emperor in Japan.

1236
00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:34.730
I mean every,

1237
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.720
basically everybody was rocking that king thing at one time.

1238
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:39.100
I mean that's amazing.

1239
00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:39.580
Yeah.

1240
00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.260
<v 5>You can't have a big society without central authority.</v>

1241
00:37:42.261 --> 00:37:46.070
It sounded off all awful to say because it sounded like you're defending some

1242
00:37:46.071 --> 00:37:47.420
fascist model of the world.

1243
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:48.910
Whereas like the stronger,

1244
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.280
again,

1245
00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.110
I'm not going to do the purpose like we a device,

1246
00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.550
but the

1247
00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:59.220
need for a center [inaudible] to keep the society in check and unfortunately

1248
00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.720
when you put enough people together is not going to work unless you have some

1249
00:38:04.731 --> 00:38:05.910
kind of central authority.

1250
00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.580
Could kind of decide is sings.

1251
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:08.620
That's the long

1252
00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:12.100
<v 2>chess game of the new world order when the,</v>

1253
00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.750
if you think about it,

1254
00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.970
why would you ever want the world to be stable?

1255
00:38:15.971 --> 00:38:17.440
Because if the world was stable,

1256
00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.290
you would need some sort of militarize government to protect you.

1257
00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:20.770
Right?

1258
00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:23.170
So the militarized government that's protecting you,

1259
00:38:23.171 --> 00:38:27.070
make sure the world's days on stable absolutely keeps the party rolling.

1260
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.250
Because if everybody just agrees to settle the fuck down and stop killing each

1261
00:38:30.251 --> 00:38:30.521
other,

1262
00:38:30.521 --> 00:38:32.530
then you don't really need as many jets.

1263
00:38:32.531 --> 00:38:34.180
You don't have as many resources,

1264
00:38:34.181 --> 00:38:36.940
as much resources to go into war.

1265
00:38:36.941 --> 00:38:38.410
There's all sorts of shit you could solve.

1266
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:44.270
Complex locked into the grip of this constantly feeding machine that constantly

1267
00:38:45.221 --> 00:38:47.410
has momentum working in the same direction.

1268
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:48.543
And it does.

1269
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.840
There's money to be made in it.

1270
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:54.841
It's not like it's a just an altruistic adventure to try to fix the world and

1271
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.500
engineer it properly.

1272
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:56.890
No,

1273
00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:57.610
no.

1274
00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:58.600
Everybody's making money.

1275
00:38:58.601 --> 00:38:59.920
It's staggering amounts.

1276
00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:02.440
It's the best money making thing in the whole world.

1277
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:03.101
That's what I mean.

1278
00:39:03.101 --> 00:39:06.050
That whole speech by highs and hour in the 50s it was a,

1279
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.780
because every,

1280
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:08.170
you know,

1281
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:08.650
Eisenhower,

1282
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:10.590
Republican guy was led,

1283
00:39:10.591 --> 00:39:11.260
uh,

1284
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.610
troops in world war two.

1285
00:39:12.611 --> 00:39:12.851
You know,

1286
00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:15.650
not the most conspiracy theory in Klein.

1287
00:39:15.651 --> 00:39:15.851
You know,

1288
00:39:15.851 --> 00:39:18.130
he's a very straight by the book kind of guy.

1289
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.130
And yet when he announces,

1290
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:20.470
you know,

1291
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:24.390
the biggest threat facing the United States in the 50 70 buddy said,

1292
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.151
well communism,

1293
00:39:25.151 --> 00:39:25.690
right?

1294
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.410
No military industrial complex.

1295
00:39:27.411 --> 00:39:30.760
It's like the fuck are you talking about again and you know the guys and

1296
00:39:30.761 --> 00:39:31.900
military guy himself,

1297
00:39:31.901 --> 00:39:34.030
a fairly conservative guy and yet he makes,

1298
00:39:34.031 --> 00:39:38.650
Nicole is saying if you let certain industries that trough it on war get too

1299
00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:39.430
big,

1300
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:44.050
they will get to have influence over government push in as to fight wars when we

1301
00:39:44.051 --> 00:39:46.060
don't really need it because of their own profit.

1302
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:47.561
And you know,

1303
00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:50.800
if he comes from some random hippie that your is like yeah,

1304
00:39:50.801 --> 00:39:51.251
whatever,

1305
00:39:51.251 --> 00:39:54.340
you know it comes from this straight lace,

1306
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:56.590
the by the book kind of guys.

1307
00:39:56.591 --> 00:39:57.490
Like Whoa,

1308
00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:58.210
really?

1309
00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.890
You know when I first found that out I,

1310
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.090
that I saw that speech,

1311
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.760
I was really pissed that no one ever showed it to me in high school.

1312
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:04.600
They never did.

1313
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.050
No,

1314
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:05.980
they didn't talk about it.

1315
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:06.790
No,

1316
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:07.623
no.

1317
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.760
I never came up in my high school.

1318
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.680
Nobody ever said that.

1319
00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:13.930
Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex,

1320
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:18.931
the concept of the military industrial complex being anything but good or the

1321
00:40:19.151 --> 00:40:21.610
military and being anything but good is never taught.

1322
00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.670
It was never taught when I was in high school and not in my school and I was

1323
00:40:25.671 --> 00:40:26.260
going to,

1324
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.790
I went to Newton south high school,

1325
00:40:27.791 --> 00:40:30.730
which was a very good high school in the suburbs of Boston.

1326
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.320
It's a very good school,

1327
00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:35.350
very smart kids and any of that.

1328
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:36.880
No,

1329
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.880
there's no idea it was there was never like [inaudible].

1330
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.640
That's a really sort of uh,

1331
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.301
that,

1332
00:40:43.301 --> 00:40:46.960
that that's a very controversial subject to be teaching children.

1333
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:47.920
It's fun though.

1334
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.753
That's what it's about.

1335
00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.830
They are going to pay attention to that.

1336
00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:54.360
They are not going to pay attention if you say the you then team uh,

1337
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.910
18 but I mean controversial in that a lot of parents are going to think that

1338
00:40:57.911 --> 00:41:01.870
that's like liberal programming and then what you're doing is bullshitting these

1339
00:41:01.871 --> 00:41:05.230
kids with your hippie ideas and you're fucking with my kid's head.

1340
00:41:05.231 --> 00:41:09.640
And it's like I'm the reporting what some Republican precedent was a or in world

1341
00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:10.474
war two said,

1342
00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.493
yeah,

1343
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:12.240
back off.

1344
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:12.520
Yeah.

1345
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.390
That's still though.

1346
00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.253
It's such a,

1347
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.093
it's such a,

1348
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:16.670
at least it was when I was in high school.

1349
00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.950
It's such a sensitive area to choose the government of doing anything nefarious

1350
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.030
that was never done.

1351
00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.470
Like when I was in high school,

1352
00:41:23.471 --> 00:41:25.740
they taught us Lee Harvey Oswald shot fucking Canada.

1353
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.350
Oh yeah,

1354
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:27.130
they did.

1355
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:27.690
They did.

1356
00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:28.291
It was right.

1357
00:41:28.291 --> 00:41:29.530
That's exactly what it was.

1358
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:34.560
They showed you Lee Harvey Oswald and they showed Jack Ruby killing Lee Harvey

1359
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.150
Oswald Gall.

1360
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.720
<v 1>Darn it.</v>

1361
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.880
We'll never even know now why he killed the president.

1362
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.860
Like they taught us that in high school,

1363
00:41:39.861 --> 00:41:44.861
and this is like years after they had the Zapruder film shown on the Geraldo

1364
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:48.170
Rivera Show where I'm Dick Gregory,

1365
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:51.710
the standup comedian brought it on the Geraldo Rivera show and showed people

1366
00:41:51.711 --> 00:41:52.070
the,

1367
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:55.110
the view of the assassination from essentially a,

1368
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.200
where this guys is uprooted was standing,

1369
00:41:57.201 --> 00:41:59.540
which we had never seen the actual assassination before.

1370
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.340
And when people watched it,

1371
00:42:01.341 --> 00:42:05.360
the first thing they thought was that this guy looks like he's been shot from

1372
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:06.320
the front.

1373
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.153
Right?

1374
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.340
Like it doesn't look like he got his head goes back into the left.

1375
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:15.290
Like he got shot by more than one person too.

1376
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.880
He got shot in his back.

1377
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:17.960
He got shot.

1378
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.470
There's,

1379
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:22.760
there's a a one wound that they turned into a tracheotomy wound,

1380
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:23.300
right?

1381
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.080
Yeah,

1382
00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:24.551
it was a,

1383
00:42:24.551 --> 00:42:26.480
it was an entry room from the front.

1384
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:27.141
It was a,

1385
00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:28.310
there was a bullet room and do it.

1386
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.300
Whereas neck was,

1387
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:33.290
and there's two different depictions of the autopsy from Bethesda,

1388
00:42:33.291 --> 00:42:34.610
Maryland to Dallas.

1389
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:35.540
It's really interesting.

1390
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:36.140
It is.

1391
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.490
It's very interesting stuff.

1392
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.890
<v 5>I guess what you were saying,</v>

1393
00:42:38.891 --> 00:42:41.750
it puts things in perspective for me because there are a bunch of times when I'm

1394
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.950
teaching class and told me,

1395
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:45.710
I'm saying this things that are the most nor most things that everybody would

1396
00:42:45.711 --> 00:42:50.150
know and I see everybody kind of like Joel dropped to the ground like,

1397
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:50.690
oh,

1398
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.060
what the fuck really that happened?

1399
00:42:52.061 --> 00:42:52.490
I'm like,

1400
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:52.701
yeah,

1401
00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:52.971
it does.

1402
00:42:52.971 --> 00:42:55.970
It definitely isn't that kind of the stuff that you normally teach and I guess

1403
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.420
no,

1404
00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:56.990
it's not.

1405
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.201
No,

1406
00:42:57.201 --> 00:42:58.010
it's not at all.

1407
00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:58.660
No.

1408
00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.820
<v 1>The normal in school,</v>

1409
00:43:00.821 --> 00:43:03.220
you're taught no conspiracy theories.

1410
00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:05.740
You were taught no variations of the truth.

1411
00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:06.491
You know,

1412
00:43:06.491 --> 00:43:06.821
you,

1413
00:43:06.821 --> 00:43:07.091
you're,

1414
00:43:07.091 --> 00:43:07.821
you're taught enough.

1415
00:43:07.821 --> 00:43:08.060
I mean,

1416
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.270
as the most controversial it gets is a,

1417
00:43:10.271 --> 00:43:12.340
Nixon was involved in a scandal in Watergate,

1418
00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.000
you know,

1419
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.680
they tell you a Nixonian that's good though.

1420
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:16.660
Cause they got rid of next.

1421
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.830
He did a bad thing.

1422
00:43:17.831 --> 00:43:18.251
This guy,

1423
00:43:18.251 --> 00:43:19.750
apparently Nixon had loose morals.

1424
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:21.680
<v 3>Did you ever listen to all those Nixon tapes?</v>

1425
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:26.150
Like there's like hundreds and hundreds of hours of tapes because they had every

1426
00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.160
thing might in the whole entire place.

1427
00:43:28.161 --> 00:43:28.670
Right.

1428
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:30.230
And there's like things where like,

1429
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.440
uh,

1430
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.500
he talks about abortion.

1431
00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.190
I just heard this not opening Anthony the other day and there's just like parts

1432
00:43:34.191 --> 00:43:36.410
where he's talking about abortion and stuff like that,

1433
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:36.860
you know,

1434
00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:37.880
just in case of like,

1435
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:40.400
you just listen to it.

1436
00:43:40.401 --> 00:43:40.971
It's crazy.

1437
00:43:40.971 --> 00:43:42.230
There's not a lot of creepy shit.

1438
00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.093
Creepy shit

1439
00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:44.090
<v 1>creep.</v>

1440
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.320
He was a creep and they found out about it by,

1441
00:43:47.321 --> 00:43:47.711
by,

1442
00:43:47.711 --> 00:43:48.544
you know,

1443
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.050
tapping into his fucking,

1444
00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:51.700
<v 3>oh he's the president.</v>

1445
00:43:51.701 --> 00:43:52.534
Oh yeah,

1446
00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:53.733
he knew about it.

1447
00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.090
They knew they were recording all that.

1448
00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:57.280
I'm responsible for it.

1449
00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:57.461
No,

1450
00:43:57.461 --> 00:43:58.390
he was responsible.

1451
00:43:58.391 --> 00:43:59.650
He had everything Mike,

1452
00:43:59.651 --> 00:44:00.760
because he wanted to,

1453
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:02.230
if anything was to happen,

1454
00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:03.790
he wanted to have proof.

1455
00:44:03.791 --> 00:44:05.110
So he was like the good guy.

1456
00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:05.831
And,

1457
00:44:05.831 --> 00:44:08.980
and what happened is that they just recorded everything and found,

1458
00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:09.843
you know,

1459
00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.430
<v 5>bugged the campaign quarter headquarters.</v>

1460
00:44:12.431 --> 00:44:14.750
So what these guys did,

1461
00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:19.250
they bagged the democratic campaign and in order to find out what they were

1462
00:44:19.251 --> 00:44:20.690
saying and when they got busted,

1463
00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:21.650
that was this kind of,

1464
00:44:21.651 --> 00:44:24.240
because it's like you out arise by keynote,

1465
00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.430
that's totally illegal.

1466
00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.481
And he said,

1467
00:44:26.481 --> 00:44:26.691
no,

1468
00:44:26.691 --> 00:44:26.901
no,

1469
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:27.351
it wasn't me.

1470
00:44:27.351 --> 00:44:27.741
It wasn't me.

1471
00:44:27.741 --> 00:44:28.161
It wasn't me.

1472
00:44:28.161 --> 00:44:32.950
And then eventually come out that it was exactly the recording is referring to

1473
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:36.480
where there's a lot of evidence of what Nixon was actually saying that he did do

1474
00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:36.960
that shit.

1475
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.660
People need to know if there are precedents or crook,

1476
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:39.930
I'm not a crook.

1477
00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:43.980
And that Nico lately afterwards fables that he said,

1478
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:44.814
well,

1479
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.760
if the president does it then it's not illegal.

1480
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:49.103
I just like

1481
00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:50.490
<v 1>you don't get them by.</v>

1482
00:44:50.491 --> 00:44:51.330
Did he really say that?

1483
00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:51.991
Well,

1484
00:44:51.991 --> 00:44:53.070
he was a creepy dude.

1485
00:44:53.071 --> 00:44:53.461
Anyway.

1486
00:44:53.461 --> 00:44:53.651
The,

1487
00:44:53.651 --> 00:44:58.470
the weirdest thing about him being president is that is the leader of this great

1488
00:44:58.471 --> 00:44:58.921
nation.

1489
00:44:58.921 --> 00:44:59.970
That's the best you can do.

1490
00:44:59.971 --> 00:45:01.230
That guy's weird man.

1491
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:02.461
That guy,

1492
00:45:02.461 --> 00:45:03.840
he's everything about him.

1493
00:45:03.841 --> 00:45:06.120
Looks like you made it with a stamp,

1494
00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:06.954
you know,

1495
00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:08.220
crested in a mold.

1496
00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:13.050
It looks like he polished it up and it though the whole like is everything was

1497
00:45:13.051 --> 00:45:14.070
weird about that guy.

1498
00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:15.030
Everything,

1499
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.841
the way they walk,

1500
00:45:15.841 --> 00:45:16.770
the way weight talked

1501
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.630
<v 5>big time.</v>

1502
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:20.830
I tend to trust the intuition in that regard,

1503
00:45:20.831 --> 00:45:22.490
at least on a person to person alive.

1504
00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.670
It like you see somebody and before they say anything you've got to vibe before

1505
00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:28.130
you've seen there is something we are toward the person or not.

1506
00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:28.911
Man,

1507
00:45:28.911 --> 00:45:29.091
look,

1508
00:45:29.091 --> 00:45:29.721
you didn't Nixon,

1509
00:45:29.721 --> 00:45:29.870
you

1510
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:30.110
<v 1>got it.</v>

1511
00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:32.030
How the fuck did he become president?

1512
00:45:32.031 --> 00:45:32.864
That's what I'm saying.

1513
00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:33.711
As you look at him,

1514
00:45:33.711 --> 00:45:37.400
he's like one of the creepiest guys ever elected to like a major office.

1515
00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.420
Why don't you go arms up in the air.

1516
00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:46.110
He's a weird looking dude and it looks so awkward and he didn't feel warm.

1517
00:45:46.491 --> 00:45:47.660
He didn't feel real.

1518
00:45:47.661 --> 00:45:48.321
He didn't feel,

1519
00:45:48.321 --> 00:45:50.090
there was nothing about him than me.

1520
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.470
Like with Kennedy,

1521
00:45:51.471 --> 00:45:52.550
Kennedy had like,

1522
00:45:52.551 --> 00:45:54.110
it was obvious he was a special man.

1523
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.981
Like it was obviously,

1524
00:45:54.981 --> 00:45:59.630
it was this handsome man of great lineage,

1525
00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:00.351
you know?

1526
00:46:00.351 --> 00:46:03.080
And he had this way of talking and this charisma,

1527
00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:04.520
that's all he could see it right there.

1528
00:46:04.521 --> 00:46:05.510
It's all real obvious.

1529
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.970
But you get to a guy like Nixon and he'd go,

1530
00:46:07.971 --> 00:46:09.740
what the fuck was going on there,

1531
00:46:09.741 --> 00:46:10.380
man?

1532
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:14.250
<v 5>And he's funny because he got elected in 1968 which is uniting the mid bill off</v>

1533
00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.140
the 60s it's Betty.

1534
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.690
And he's precisely because the 60 sort of going on,

1535
00:46:18.691 --> 00:46:21.450
the Conservatives got freaked diodes and they started,

1536
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:22.411
oh my God,

1537
00:46:22.411 --> 00:46:23.760
the country is going in this crazy,

1538
00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:24.181
wild,

1539
00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:25.710
godless liberal direction.

1540
00:46:25.711 --> 00:46:26.730
We need to take it back.

1541
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.870
Hardcore politically organized to try to act.

1542
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.500
And they got Nixonian office.

1543
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:33.203
Yeah.

1544
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:33.931
But yeah,

1545
00:46:33.931 --> 00:46:34.141
man,

1546
00:46:34.141 --> 00:46:34.900
Nixon is a three.

1547
00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:39.400
If they say that the election of 1960 was the first election where they add the

1548
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:42.180
debate was on TV and that they had,

1549
00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:42.960
uh,

1550
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.471
four,

1551
00:46:43.471 --> 00:46:44.280
um,

1552
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.410
they say that people would really,

1553
00:46:45.411 --> 00:46:48.540
it on the radio to the debate think that Nixon had done pretty well,

1554
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.040
but then people will watch it on TV.

1555
00:46:50.041 --> 00:46:53.460
They overwhelmingly thought Kennedy dominated cause he's so handsome.

1556
00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:54.060
Exactly.

1557
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.860
And that he looked good by comparison,

1558
00:46:55.890 --> 00:47:00.030
whereas Nixon was like these weird looking thrawled that was scary as hell on so

1559
00:47:00.031 --> 00:47:00.571
many ways.

1560
00:47:00.571 --> 00:47:02.040
And so anybody watching on TV,

1561
00:47:02.041 --> 00:47:02.670
it was like,

1562
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:03.600
fuck that guy.

1563
00:47:03.601 --> 00:47:04.960
He was sweating like a pig.

1564
00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:05.910
He was doing all that.

1565
00:47:05.911 --> 00:47:06.744
It's like

1566
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:07.830
<v 1>that's instinctive.</v>

1567
00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:08.020
I,

1568
00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:08.910
it shouldn't be,

1569
00:47:08.911 --> 00:47:09.840
but it's instinctive.

1570
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:10.180
There's,

1571
00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:10.801
I mean it's not,

1572
00:47:10.801 --> 00:47:13.710
it's not even an appearance thing cause Rodney Dangerfield was kind of an ugly

1573
00:47:13.711 --> 00:47:14.011
dude,

1574
00:47:14.011 --> 00:47:15.450
but he was so lovable and warm.

1575
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.250
You know what I mean?

1576
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.020
I mean if Rodney Dangerfield had the creepy behavior of Nixon,

1577
00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:20.010
he would be just as creepy,

1578
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.250
of course is like Nixon lacked any charisma.

1579
00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:23.920
<v 5>When,</v>

1580
00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:24.980
when you tell people,

1581
00:47:24.981 --> 00:47:25.410
you know,

1582
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:25.630
Oh,

1583
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:27.140
you trust first impressions,

1584
00:47:27.141 --> 00:47:27.510
they were like,

1585
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.681
whoa,

1586
00:47:27.681 --> 00:47:28.470
that's superficial.

1587
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:30.850
They are only looking at somebody as good looking or not.

1588
00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:33.310
It's not even about that is there's a vibe to people.

1589
00:47:33.311 --> 00:47:33.641
There's,

1590
00:47:33.641 --> 00:47:34.091
to me,

1591
00:47:34.091 --> 00:47:35.200
I'm a big believer of that.

1592
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.730
I don't know exactly what you see.

1593
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:39.430
I don't know if you some specific about the language.

1594
00:47:39.431 --> 00:47:40.900
I don't know what is that you see,

1595
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:44.890
but to me is every single I've ever gone through his return on your skin.

1596
00:47:44.891 --> 00:47:46.930
You know he's right in New Zealand now you'll move.

1597
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:49.180
Is it now your talk is in now you're do every since.

1598
00:47:49.181 --> 00:47:54.181
So it shows up and to me is not weird that some people can see it.

1599
00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:55.570
It's like why the fuck can't,

1600
00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:59.380
most people see it as like a Chihuahua and this isn't the fuel for 30 seconds

1601
00:47:59.381 --> 00:48:03.300
and decide exactly Barca to you or be all like,

1602
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:04.200
you know,

1603
00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.250
it's like if a Chihuahua I can do it.

1604
00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:06.911
Yeah,

1605
00:48:06.911 --> 00:48:07.641
but let me tell you something.

1606
00:48:07.641 --> 00:48:09.280
Two hours are wrong all the time.

1607
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:12.070
They bark constantly.

1608
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.300
They're not the best.

1609
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.630
That's not the best faculty for a dog.

1610
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.320
That doesn't qualify as a dog anyway.

1611
00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.190
But that is true.

1612
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:23.190
The dog sniff you out and learn things about you and people.

1613
00:48:23.561 --> 00:48:23.680
Yeah,

1614
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.141
<v 2>Ken too.</v>

1615
00:48:24.141 --> 00:48:24.671
When you have a,

1616
00:48:24.671 --> 00:48:26.090
we have a weird way of,

1617
00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:29.530
you know whether or not you trust it and whether or not it's tuned in.

1618
00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:30.460
You know,

1619
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:31.900
you got to have a,

1620
00:48:31.901 --> 00:48:35.950
been around plenty of crazy people and be taken a really good look at your own

1621
00:48:35.951 --> 00:48:36.580
self,

1622
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.820
look at yourself like really truly objectively your fault,

1623
00:48:39.821 --> 00:48:42.940
all of it to be able to recognize it in other people because if you're

1624
00:48:42.941 --> 00:48:44.080
bullshitting yourself,

1625
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.080
it's super easy to get bullshitted course.

1626
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.721
Of course.

1627
00:48:46.721 --> 00:48:46.960
Yeah.

1628
00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:48.400
And if you're bullshit bullshitting other people,

1629
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:51.490
it's also easy to get bullshitted cause you know,

1630
00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:53.170
you like that.

1631
00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:58.270
That was like a big thing and gambling was the double dump when a guy thought he

1632
00:48:58.271 --> 00:48:59.260
was getting dumped,

1633
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.420
but really they were dumping on him.

1634
00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:01.751
You know,

1635
00:49:01.751 --> 00:49:06.190
the double dump where you know you're manipulating how a a game goes down.

1636
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.053
Right.

1637
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:09.230
<v 5>People are devious little fucks.</v>

1638
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.280
Are you sure are?

1639
00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.480
Well not all of them.

1640
00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:12.260
A lot of them.

1641
00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.040
Lots of them.

1642
00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:13.760
Good percentage.

1643
00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.180
Yeah.

1644
00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:15.013
Give you that.

1645
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.400
Once we read each other's minds,

1646
00:49:16.401 --> 00:49:17.420
that shit's all going to stop.

1647
00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:17.930
Yeah.

1648
00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:18.560
I think that,

1649
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.700
I think that's the next step.

1650
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.630
The next step of evolution is going to be knowing whether or not someone's

1651
00:49:23.631 --> 00:49:24.081
bullshitting.

1652
00:49:24.081 --> 00:49:24.780
Yeah.

1653
00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:25.130
Oh,

1654
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:26.210
save so much.

1655
00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:27.560
But to me that's,

1656
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.160
I dunno.

1657
00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.380
Maybe I'm too like,

1658
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.651
Ooh,

1659
00:49:30.651 --> 00:49:32.150
psychic powers or some shit about,

1660
00:49:32.151 --> 00:49:35.780
to me that's not even that hard to do now let alone like to me,

1661
00:49:35.781 --> 00:49:37.100
what about that Jodie areas?

1662
00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:38.180
Well,

1663
00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:38.450
I mean,

1664
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:39.420
that's what I mean is that,

1665
00:49:39.421 --> 00:49:40.610
let me tell you something son.

1666
00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.473
She would've Gotcha.

1667
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:43.483
Gotcha.

1668
00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.020
Chin.

1669
00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:46.850
She was cute enough that you would say,

1670
00:49:46.851 --> 00:49:47.684
you know,

1671
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:48.950
she wants to be with me.

1672
00:49:48.951 --> 00:49:49.880
I'm going to take a chance.

1673
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:51.690
You'll be in there with their Tam and like,

1674
00:49:51.691 --> 00:49:53.540
she doesn't look like an obvious freak.

1675
00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:56.350
There's nothing that's cream freak freak.

1676
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.631
No,

1677
00:49:56.631 --> 00:49:56.781
no.

1678
00:49:56.781 --> 00:49:57.081
I mean,

1679
00:49:57.081 --> 00:49:57.561
just like,

1680
00:49:57.561 --> 00:49:58.440
we are like,

1681
00:49:58.450 --> 00:49:58.750
oh,

1682
00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:59.660
stop you in the shower.

1683
00:49:59.661 --> 00:50:00.494
Kind of fatigue.

1684
00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:04.040
But as azine she does look freakishly cold.

1685
00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.810
Like there's something there that's like,

1686
00:50:05.811 --> 00:50:07.640
there's something weird going on emotionally,

1687
00:50:07.641 --> 00:50:08.780
so I wouldn't be able to tell.

1688
00:50:08.781 --> 00:50:09.271
Oh yeah,

1689
00:50:09.271 --> 00:50:11.540
she's this weird a wanna be,

1690
00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:12.860
but you could that like,

1691
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:13.250
Huh,

1692
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:14.300
there's something off there.

1693
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.210
That bitch is Correy

1694
00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:18.030
<v 2>did you see the um,</v>

1695
00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:18.890
the video,

1696
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:21.410
the security video of her after they arrested her?

1697
00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:21.591
No,

1698
00:50:21.591 --> 00:50:22.840
I didn't say it louder.

1699
00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:27.830
Headstands and headstands singing to herself like they're locking her up in a

1700
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:28.250
cage

1701
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.580
<v 1>for the rest of their life for murder and probably going to put her to death.</v>

1702
00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:31.910
Right.

1703
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:32.870
And she's singing.

1704
00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:33.753
Yep.

1705
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.810
And then when they asked her from jail,

1706
00:50:35.811 --> 00:50:37.400
like they have a jailhouse interview.

1707
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:40.220
It's stunning how well she lies about this.

1708
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:41.121
And you know,

1709
00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:44.720
it's a beautiful thing that people do so well when they lie about shit like

1710
00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:45.200
that.

1711
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:45.501
Well,

1712
00:50:45.501 --> 00:50:47.360
how are you staying calm?

1713
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:48.560
My faith.

1714
00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:50.000
My faith.

1715
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Just think about that statement that your faith after you stabbed a dude like 28

1716
00:50:56.001 --> 00:50:56.571
times,

1717
00:50:56.571 --> 00:50:57.950
shot him in the head,

1718
00:50:57.951 --> 00:50:59.240
slit his neck.

1719
00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:03.320
Like this bitch did some crazy shit to this guy's body.

1720
00:51:03.321 --> 00:51:04.120
Yup.

1721
00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:05.420
And she's like my faith.

1722
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:09.350
It makes me think she actually believes it when she saved my faith.

1723
00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:12.080
I think there's a good chunk of pharaoh actually believe what she's saying.

1724
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:16.130
She could be one of those people that's so crazy that they sorta reformed their

1725
00:51:16.131 --> 00:51:17.990
reality every three or four hours.

1726
00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.220
There's people like that.

1727
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:21.050
I've seen people that have um,

1728
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.860
been able to justify almost anything because they just sort of put it away and

1729
00:51:24.861 --> 00:51:26.210
then there's a new reality,

1730
00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:26.871
you know,

1731
00:51:26.871 --> 00:51:27.920
I've never done anything like that.

1732
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:28.730
Like you just did it.

1733
00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:30.250
What the fuck you talking about like this?

1734
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.130
There's a lot of people that are like that.

1735
00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:36.830
They could just shut parts of the brain off and unfortunately I think a lot of

1736
00:51:36.831 --> 00:51:38.120
them suffered childhood abuse.

1737
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:38.871
Yeah.

1738
00:51:38.871 --> 00:51:39.140
In fact,

1739
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.250
that's the thing that's sometimes,

1740
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:40.461
you know,

1741
00:51:40.461 --> 00:51:41.990
when you've got the whole background story,

1742
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:42.920
you almost feel bad,

1743
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:43.560
but then you know,

1744
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.250
you feel bad for the five year old.

1745
00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:49.280
You don't feel bad for the person you have become because it's like,

1746
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.170
I understand how you got there,

1747
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:53.300
but understanding doesn't mean justifying.

1748
00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:54.733
Exactly.

1749
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:55.693
Exactly.

1750
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:56.900
It's too fucked up.

1751
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:58.470
Sorry Ken,

1752
00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.280
let that slot.

1753
00:51:59.280 --> 00:51:59.910
Absolutely.

1754
00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:03.980
It's just there's certain things as a race we have to figure out how to stop it

1755
00:52:03.981 --> 00:52:07.910
from occurring and I don't think we put any resources into that.

1756
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:13.150
It's amazing how much we put resources into making sure that marijuana stays

1757
00:52:13.791 --> 00:52:14.510
illegal.

1758
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:16.220
Think about how much money is involved in that.

1759
00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:16.700
What is it,

1760
00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.550
4 billion a year or something like that.

1761
00:52:18.551 --> 00:52:19.210
It's crazy.

1762
00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:20.043
Something nutty.

1763
00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:20.790
And how,

1764
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:25.430
how much have we really put into trying to help people?

1765
00:52:25.431 --> 00:52:27.380
They're doing a shitty job of raising their children.

1766
00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.340
How much,

1767
00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.173
I mean,

1768
00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.770
besides like what,

1769
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.940
I don't know what you can do really.

1770
00:52:31.941 --> 00:52:35.870
I mean besides actively going in there and taking their kids away,

1771
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:36.531
you know,

1772
00:52:36.531 --> 00:52:38.840
but it just some form of education,

1773
00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.600
some community centers,

1774
00:52:40.601 --> 00:52:41.100
something.

1775
00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:43.190
I just feel like when you see like really,

1776
00:52:43.191 --> 00:52:45.260
really poor neighborhoods that are ignored,

1777
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:47.780
you're just asking for problems.

1778
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:49.820
Of course you're just asking for problems.

1779
00:52:49.821 --> 00:52:51.440
You should fix that.

1780
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:54.230
Level that up as much as possible.

1781
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.290
Help those people out as much as possible and help them to get the fuck out of

1782
00:52:57.291 --> 00:52:57.590
there.

1783
00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:58.111
And the,

1784
00:52:58.111 --> 00:52:58.490
the,

1785
00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.701
the,

1786
00:52:58.701 --> 00:53:01.970
the thing that drives me crazy about people when they talk about people that are

1787
00:53:01.971 --> 00:53:02.540
in the ghetto,

1788
00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:02.780
like,

1789
00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:03.021
oh,

1790
00:53:03.021 --> 00:53:04.460
they're poor and they're lazy.

1791
00:53:04.461 --> 00:53:05.900
That's why they're still on welfare.

1792
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.160
You know,

1793
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.160
if they don't want to work,

1794
00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:08.260
you don't,

1795
00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.110
you don't get it.

1796
00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:09.980
You don't get it.

1797
00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:12.320
They are in a shit spot.

1798
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:16.580
And it's super hard to have a good mentality when you're in a shitty spot.

1799
00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:18.740
It's very hard to see.

1800
00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.420
So to say that they,

1801
00:53:20.421 --> 00:53:20.900
you know,

1802
00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:24.110
it was just fucking get off their lazy your eyes and stop collecting welfare.

1803
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:25.463
You're,

1804
00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:27.940
I think you're probably missing what's going on in there,

1805
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:28.833
you know,

1806
00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.250
ideology aside,

1807
00:53:30.251 --> 00:53:32.380
right wing rhetoric aside,

1808
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:32.760
you're,

1809
00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:36.250
you're dealing with someone who got a terrible roll the dice and that could have

1810
00:53:36.251 --> 00:53:36.581
been you,

1811
00:53:36.581 --> 00:53:36.970
man.

1812
00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:37.840
You could have been in that.

1813
00:53:37.841 --> 00:53:41.680
And just because you can pull out a story or two or three about people who are

1814
00:53:41.681 --> 00:53:42.461
in that situation.

1815
00:53:42.461 --> 00:53:47.461
And then rob went on to get his phd and to this day he says that living in the

1816
00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:49.300
ghetto does not hold you back.

1817
00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:50.680
It's a prison of your own mind,

1818
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:51.370
right?

1819
00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:52.840
It's like there's always those stories.

1820
00:53:52.841 --> 00:53:57.640
But the reality is how much good role models to those kids have.

1821
00:53:57.641 --> 00:53:58.930
How many good role models,

1822
00:53:58.931 --> 00:54:00.820
how much good inspiration,

1823
00:54:00.821 --> 00:54:02.560
how much hope for the future.

1824
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:04.300
<v 5>Student of mine,</v>

1825
00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:08.030
a very first semester I started teaching it was this guy was from south central

1826
00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:11.010
La and we started to chat enough their words and Matt and his stories.

1827
00:54:11.011 --> 00:54:14.590
He would tell me about what was normal buyer day to day life.

1828
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.581
It'd be like yeah,

1829
00:54:15.581 --> 00:54:19.180
yesterday you didn't get home until midnight from class cause they had somebody

1830
00:54:19.181 --> 00:54:22.180
killed the write down my door and so they had lock it up with a whole bunch just

1831
00:54:22.181 --> 00:54:23.260
like fuck really?

1832
00:54:23.261 --> 00:54:26.020
And that shit would look at and like three times a year.

1833
00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:26.530
Yeah.

1834
00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:27.460
It happens all the time.

1835
00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.600
It happens all the time.

1836
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:30.651
<v 1>Real dangerous.</v>

1837
00:54:30.651 --> 00:54:30.860
Who,

1838
00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:31.590
you know,

1839
00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:33.230
running into the wrong vehicle.

1840
00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:34.910
It's all real dangerous.

1841
00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:35.600
Yup.

1842
00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.201
And you know,

1843
00:54:36.201 --> 00:54:37.940
one's doing shit about it and you know,

1844
00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:38.150
they do.

1845
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:42.020
All they do about it is they arrest people when people do things that are bad,

1846
00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:42.530
you know,

1847
00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:45.140
instead of making cops lives way easier.

1848
00:54:45.141 --> 00:54:47.930
And this is all very utopian hippy.

1849
00:54:47.931 --> 00:54:48.711
We need to fix it.

1850
00:54:48.711 --> 00:54:49.461
We needed to do something,

1851
00:54:49.461 --> 00:54:50.090
go together.

1852
00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:51.980
But it's just weird to me that it never comes up.

1853
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.110
It's weird to me that if you do bring it up,

1854
00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:58.250
oh it's socialism and and people cry like tents.

1855
00:54:58.880 --> 00:54:59.960
There's a bunch of babies there,

1856
00:54:59.961 --> 00:55:00.470
man.

1857
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:03.050
There's like a whole community of,

1858
00:55:03.051 --> 00:55:03.771
of a,

1859
00:55:03.771 --> 00:55:06.640
of future people that you can affect.

1860
00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:07.160
This is,

1861
00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:11.870
he was a whole new generation of future people that if emphasis is put on

1862
00:55:11.871 --> 00:55:13.430
helping it can,

1863
00:55:13.431 --> 00:55:17.420
how it can somehow or another we could figure out a way to like at least

1864
00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.450
eliminate a certain aspect aspect

1865
00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:21.880
<v 5>of the lowest of our lowest class society.</v>

1866
00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:22.810
You know,

1867
00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:25.060
it seems like that could be done with education.

1868
00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:27.370
It seems like at least part of it can be done.

1869
00:55:27.371 --> 00:55:28.090
Sure.

1870
00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:29.950
Definitely better than it is currently.

1871
00:55:29.951 --> 00:55:32.650
At least we just not say much but only stairs.

1872
00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:38.970
It's just one of the most frustrating things is how far we've come as a human

1873
00:55:39.221 --> 00:55:42.760
race and yet how far we have to go when it comes to shit like that.

1874
00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:43.803
Absolutely.

1875
00:55:44.110 --> 00:55:44.231
Yeah.

1876
00:55:44.231 --> 00:55:44.411
Cause,

1877
00:55:44.411 --> 00:55:46.160
I mean the whole nine fuzzy Sony individuality,

1878
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:49.210
Nisha TV's like pull yourself up by your bootstrap and stuff.

1879
00:55:49.211 --> 00:55:52.960
There's something good about that of course that he's an adamant about self

1880
00:55:52.961 --> 00:55:55.450
empowerment that the regardless of circumstances,

1881
00:55:55.451 --> 00:55:58.450
you know you're not going to try to change their code status says suggests cause

1882
00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.890
you wish it so that he's an and where they interviewed.

1883
00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:04.780
Whether it needs to find a way because if nothing else is doing it for you,

1884
00:56:04.781 --> 00:56:06.610
you might as well do your best to do it.

1885
00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.710
But having said that,

1886
00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.880
most people then use that argument to Disney.

1887
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:12.490
So the social conditions,

1888
00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:13.390
it becomes a,

1889
00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:15.250
well it's just up to you.

1890
00:56:15.251 --> 00:56:16.870
We'll show goes on,

1891
00:56:16.871 --> 00:56:19.040
we are all behind you kind of shit is.

1892
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:24.040
In the meantime you start from 50 behind everyone

1893
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.480
<v 1>else because you've got to weigh up in a shitty place with drug abuse all over</v>

1894
00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:31.000
with alcohol abuse all over with neural models with the whole thing.

1895
00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:31.590
And he's like,

1896
00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:31.810
bye,

1897
00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:32.920
you know you can do it.

1898
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:33.280
I said,

1899
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.113
well yeah,

1900
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.690
sweet.

1901
00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:36.000
Sweet of you to say it wasn't,

1902
00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:36.370
you know,

1903
00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:37.750
you haven't grown up in that shit.

1904
00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:39.250
It's such a cliche,

1905
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.950
but a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

1906
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:43.330
And if we really,

1907
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.990
you know,

1908
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:48.340
the most patriotic thing that we could do as a country is not go fuck with some

1909
00:56:48.341 --> 00:56:51.400
other countries overseas with dubious intentions,

1910
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:52.060
but,

1911
00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:53.710
but strengthen our weakest link,

1912
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:56.860
the weakest economic link or weakest social thing.

1913
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:58.743
It's like that's a,

1914
00:56:58.800 --> 00:56:59.111
it's a,

1915
00:56:59.111 --> 00:57:01.690
it's a weird thing that politicians don't talk about that,

1916
00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:06.640
but they don't offer that up as a plan for the future take,

1917
00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:07.750
you know,

1918
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:08.620
but give country,

1919
00:57:08.621 --> 00:57:10.930
give companies contracts to clean up the ghetto,

1920
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.210
right.

1921
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:14.080
The same kind of contracts you give to clean up fucking Iraq.

1922
00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:16.120
Give contracts to clean up again though,

1923
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:16.781
it'd be amazing,

1924
00:57:16.781 --> 00:57:16.990
Glenn,

1925
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:18.990
let Halbert and make money cleaning up the ghetto.

1926
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.990
W W why can't they do that?

1927
00:57:20.991 --> 00:57:21.281
And I don't,

1928
00:57:21.281 --> 00:57:23.020
I don't understand why I can't profit off of that.

1929
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:28.560
It seems ridiculous and it seems like it's just at this point in time,

1930
00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:34.750
2013 we're still doing the same goddamn shit.

1931
00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:40.260
Still going over to countries get involved and dubious shit.

1932
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:41.260
Right.

1933
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:46.260
Somehow or another it can or can't be tied to resources and oil and this and

1934
00:57:46.301 --> 00:57:46.571
that.

1935
00:57:46.571 --> 00:57:47.050
And Barlage,

1936
00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:50.710
conspiracy theory were over there and stop it as long from taking over our

1937
00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:51.544
underwear,

1938
00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:52.630
whatever the fuck it is.

1939
00:57:52.631 --> 00:57:54.640
It's like the same God damn shell game.

1940
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:55.420
Yep.

1941
00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:55.830
Wow.

1942
00:57:55.830 --> 00:57:57.040
<v 5>I mean in fact that's what's fun.</v>

1943
00:57:57.041 --> 00:57:57.121
Yeah.

1944
00:57:57.121 --> 00:57:58.590
I guess I keep thinking you don't have today,

1945
00:57:58.591 --> 00:57:59.850
but that's because you started on him.

1946
00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:01.220
We'd done Carly and I was gonna Faint.

1947
00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.510
We see it is about the Roman republic.

1948
00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:04.403
Yeah.

1949
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:07.020
Mario's cause he was the same exact dynamics.

1950
00:58:07.021 --> 00:58:07.330
You see

1951
00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:08.080
<v 1>them today.</v>

1952
00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:08.620
Yeah.

1953
00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:09.400
Buy The book.

1954
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:10.233
Exactly.

1955
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:11.583
Vulnerable.

1956
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:12.523
It's unavoidable.

1957
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:13.151
It's such,

1958
00:58:13.151 --> 00:58:13.984
we're stupid.

1959
00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:14.883
We're broken.

1960
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:16.480
We're broken little crazy animals.

1961
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.100
We don't know how to like keep it together.

1962
00:58:18.101 --> 00:58:18.460
We get,

1963
00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:21.850
we get it together for a certain amount of time and then we fucking spiral out

1964
00:58:21.851 --> 00:58:23.860
of control and just slamming into the rocks.

1965
00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:26.440
<v 5>It's a fucking weird because I don't know,</v>

1966
00:58:26.441 --> 00:58:27.450
I mean not these,

1967
00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:27.791
when,

1968
00:58:27.791 --> 00:58:28.030
uh,

1969
00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:31.540
when I look at myself and I analyze like where I'm at,

1970
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:33.100
I'm happy with me or not.

1971
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.440
I see so much fucking room for improvement.

1972
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:36.610
There are lots of times they were like,

1973
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:36.851
Eh,

1974
00:58:36.851 --> 00:58:37.600
you know I,

1975
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.900
I'm glad you see it cause I've been meaning to talk to you about your,

1976
00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:41.093
but

1977
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.220
I see a lot of it.

1978
00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:44.770
I like myself.

1979
00:58:44.771 --> 00:58:45.431
There are good things,

1980
00:58:45.431 --> 00:58:46.300
but I also see like,

1981
00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.010
ah fuck this thing is not so good.

1982
00:58:48.011 --> 00:58:50.080
They see in Ghana it's a weakness.

1983
00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:53.560
Then I look at everyone else and I'm like fuck,

1984
00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:54.453
I'm a god.

1985
00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.190
That's going to be a meme on the Internet for sure.

1986
00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:02.470
Then I look at everyone else and I'm like,

1987
00:59:02.471 --> 00:59:02.881
fuck,

1988
00:59:02.881 --> 00:59:03.714
I'm a god.

1989
00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.500
That is a meme and a half.

1990
00:59:05.501 --> 00:59:07.000
So I need just fuck yourself.

1991
00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:08.800
You just fucked yourself hard.

1992
00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:11.860
You better hope and pray you don't say anything stupid for the next three years

1993
00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:14.410
because that's how long they remember a meme for.

1994
00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:15.740
So good,

1995
00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:16.573
let's do it.

1996
00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:18.400
And I look at everyone else and I'm like,

1997
00:59:18.401 --> 00:59:18.791
fuck,

1998
00:59:18.791 --> 00:59:19.624
I'm a god.

1999
00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.010
The thing that's funny is it's not that

2000
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.540
<v 2>I really think like I'm all that.</v>

2001
00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:26.570
Cause when I look at objectively just me,

2002
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:30.440
I do see so many places where I could improve.

2003
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:32.160
But then you know the barriers,

2004
00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:34.040
so fucking low on average,

2005
00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:35.360
the average human being,

2006
00:59:35.361 --> 00:59:38.270
there's so many fucked up shit that people do that I'm like,

2007
00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:38.720
wow,

2008
00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.290
okay,

2009
00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:40.550
that's at least right,

2010
00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:43.970
right when you think that you're a loser because he can't pay your credit card.

2011
00:59:43.971 --> 00:59:47.520
You hear about this guy in Cleveland then as kidnap three women for 10 years and

2012
00:59:47.521 --> 00:59:47.681
you go,

2013
00:59:47.681 --> 00:59:47.790
oh,

2014
00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:48.890
I'm not really a bad person.

2015
00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:49.660
Okay.

2016
00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:50.493
It's,

2017
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:51.051
yeah,

2018
00:59:51.051 --> 00:59:51.620
but that's,

2019
00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:54.200
that's why it's important to surround yourself with bad motherfuckers.

2020
00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:55.370
That's very important.

2021
00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:56.450
You know,

2022
00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:56.790
the,

2023
00:59:56.790 --> 00:59:59.510
to surround yourself with cool people like one,

2024
00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:02.540
one of the things that I've gotten really good at it as I've become an adult,

2025
01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.070
as I collect cool people,

2026
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:05.900
I know how to collect cool friends.

2027
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:09.410
I got a bunch of cool people that I've managed to sneak into my life.

2028
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:13.550
And that's very important because when you have questions about something,

2029
01:00:13.551 --> 01:00:15.020
when you want to talk to somebody about something,

2030
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.530
like I can resource a database of cool,

2031
01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:19.370
intelligent,

2032
01:00:19.371 --> 01:00:20.490
level headed,

2033
01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:21.291
you know,

2034
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:22.460
healthy ego people.

2035
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:23.980
That's super important.

2036
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:24.890
So hard to find.

2037
01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.610
It is.

2038
01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:29.600
That's one of the most important things about choosing a place to live or

2039
01:00:29.601 --> 01:00:33.980
choosing people to be around is surrounding yourself with inspirational people.

2040
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:37.340
People who also are healthy,

2041
01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:38.480
people who are excited,

2042
01:00:38.481 --> 01:00:39.860
people have good attitudes.

2043
01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.930
People aren't lazy bitches.

2044
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:43.740
That's what I already did most called meant.

2045
01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:45.770
I see when I look at your board,

2046
01:00:45.771 --> 01:00:47.210
when I look at Duncan's board,

2047
01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:48.980
like people to see me as where people,

2048
01:00:48.981 --> 01:00:50.120
when I send you an email like,

2049
01:00:50.121 --> 01:00:50.271
oh,

2050
01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:50.631
I love it.

2051
01:00:50.631 --> 01:00:52.250
The politics are such that have stuff like that.

2052
01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.250
So many people say the exact same thing you're saying,

2053
01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:57.890
which is Jesus Christ.

2054
01:00:57.891 --> 01:01:01.830
I can find around me the kind of conversations that you guys have on.

2055
01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:02.450
I thought,

2056
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:02.781
man,

2057
01:01:02.781 --> 01:01:03.201
I wish,

2058
01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:04.280
and that's why at least them,

2059
01:01:04.281 --> 01:01:06.710
because I can't find it around me.

2060
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:07.290
And uh,

2061
01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:07.760
you know,

2062
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.450
it's amazing.

2063
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:11.780
It's inspiring to be reminded that not all humanities like that.

2064
01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:12.441
Well,

2065
01:01:12.441 --> 01:01:14.900
you know what it is is a lot of people that think like this,

2066
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:15.890
like us out there,

2067
01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.360
but there were,

2068
01:01:17.361 --> 01:01:20.150
weren't connected by like a show.

2069
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:23.420
It's like they were all floating around and you,

2070
01:01:23.421 --> 01:01:28.130
you sort of locked into certain ideologies and sometimes you could listen to

2071
01:01:28.131 --> 01:01:29.660
this kind of a show or that kind of a show,

2072
01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:30.733
but it,

2073
01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.540
you know,

2074
01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:35.270
it didn't get locked in to where you can all meet up.

2075
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:39.530
It's almost like you need a spot where you meet up and then everybody goes,

2076
01:01:39.531 --> 01:01:40.364
I'm not alone.

2077
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:41.300
I'm not crazy.

2078
01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.021
I'm not alone.

2079
01:01:42.021 --> 01:01:42.261
Yeah,

2080
01:01:42.261 --> 01:01:43.100
this world is fucked.

2081
01:01:43.101 --> 01:01:43.520
Thank you.

2082
01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.860
Cause I get up every day and I look at my alarm clock and I go,

2083
01:01:45.861 --> 01:01:46.880
what the fuck is the point?

2084
01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.040
And going to my whack ass job.

2085
01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:49.320
Right.

2086
01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.770
Well this is a crazy fucked up world.

2087
01:01:51.771 --> 01:01:53.000
It doesn't make any sense at all.

2088
01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.500
And I'm just stuck in the system,

2089
01:01:54.501 --> 01:01:58.220
which eats up most of my time and therefore leaves me with no time to really

2090
01:01:58.221 --> 01:01:59.600
think about what I'm doing.

2091
01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:04.280
So I'm just caught a creature of momentum floating down the river life,

2092
01:02:04.281 --> 01:02:08.000
trying to figure out a way to get to a lily pad and just catch a breath.

2093
01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:08.930
Fuck me.

2094
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:10.430
Fuck man.

2095
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:11.720
So,

2096
01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:12.560
you know,

2097
01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:15.590
that's one of the best things about living in la.

2098
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.041
It's said,

2099
01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:18.410
I know so many cool people that live around here.

2100
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.310
It's one of the only thing that keeps me around.

2101
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:21.283
Yup.

2102
01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:21.950
So,

2103
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:22.290
so,

2104
01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:25.050
so important and so important to do it through podcast too.

2105
01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:25.740
You know,

2106
01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:26.670
when we do it,

2107
01:02:26.671 --> 01:02:28.140
when we bring you these people,

2108
01:02:28.141 --> 01:02:29.490
you guys out there listening,

2109
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.140
we'll bring you these people like Danielle,

2110
01:02:31.141 --> 01:02:31.974
they ballet La,

2111
01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.870
Joe Diaz and Duncan Trussell.

2112
01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:35.003
You know,

2113
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:35.760
that stuff.

2114
01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.240
Uh,

2115
01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:36.530
when,

2116
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.900
when that,

2117
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.040
when it spreads like that,

2118
01:02:38.041 --> 01:02:38.431
like I said,

2119
01:02:38.431 --> 01:02:39.510
it's good for everybody.

2120
01:02:39.511 --> 01:02:40.680
That's good for all of us.

2121
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:41.491
Yeah.

2122
01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:42.870
Cause I mean imagine yard the guy,

2123
01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:45.210
we're leave seen a town of 2000 people,

2124
01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.110
I don't know,

2125
01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:47.130
Nebraska or something.

2126
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:47.581
Yeah.

2127
01:02:47.581 --> 01:02:49.350
And you hired a,

2128
01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:53.340
everybody you'd relate to feel like they live in a parallel universe.

2129
01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.630
I feel like you're the weird,

2130
01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:58.260
before Internet you would have been really fucked with Internet.

2131
01:02:58.261 --> 01:03:00.390
You can have access to a holiday or award out there.

2132
01:03:00.391 --> 01:03:00.840
We were like,

2133
01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.590
okay,

2134
01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:03.690
I'm not exactly all the crazy one in town.

2135
01:03:03.691 --> 01:03:05.070
There really is something different.

2136
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:06.660
You can share it with other people.

2137
01:03:06.661 --> 01:03:07.470
In your town too.

2138
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:07.921
You can say,

2139
01:03:07.921 --> 01:03:08.371
listen,

2140
01:03:08.371 --> 01:03:11.670
this dude named Duncan Trussell and you gotta hear this fucking podcast and it's

2141
01:03:11.671 --> 01:03:13.470
going to change the way you look at marriage.

2142
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:16.370
Or I flashlights don't for a fleshlight.

2143
01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:17.100
Yeah.

2144
01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:17.900
That's uh,

2145
01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.610
that's what the Internet provides that nobody had before.

2146
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:21.150
Yeah.

2147
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:21.361
You know,

2148
01:03:21.361 --> 01:03:24.360
that's one of the things that was really fascinating about this Dan Carlin

2149
01:03:24.361 --> 01:03:29.010
podcast as he was talking about Martin Luther and how they printed up.

2150
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:30.840
This is a amazing stuff folks.

2151
01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:36.090
They made these little like pamphlets and they handed out these pamphlets,

2152
01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.030
um,

2153
01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:37.390
uh,

2154
01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:41.490
about religion and people would hide them and share them with each other and

2155
01:03:41.491 --> 01:03:41.760
they were,

2156
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.960
they were like secret,

2157
01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:43.750
like through,

2158
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.960
and it's spread like a wildfire.

2159
01:03:45.961 --> 01:03:46.620
This guy,

2160
01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.520
Martin Luther,

2161
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.560
he was the first guy that to translate the Bible in a phonetic language,

2162
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:56.130
the first guy to make it so that the people who didn't understand Latin could

2163
01:03:56.131 --> 01:03:57.870
actually read the word of the Bible.

2164
01:03:58.070 --> 01:03:58.261
Yeah.

2165
01:03:58.261 --> 01:04:00.810
Cause at that time when he started doing that,

2166
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:05.550
he was a death penalty offense all nearby Borlaug and read it in,

2167
01:04:05.551 --> 01:04:06.030
you know,

2168
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:06.780
could he stay uncommon?

2169
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:08.110
Three she was bad,

2170
01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:08.460
bad,

2171
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:08.730
bad,

2172
01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:11.970
but you gotta be a priest because all of the epar yeast can read it correctly.

2173
01:04:11.971 --> 01:04:12.990
If you read it on your own,

2174
01:04:12.991 --> 01:04:16.560
you're going to screw syncs up and pollute the word of God and back then the

2175
01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:17.970
pope had bitches.

2176
01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.310
Of course the pope had mistresses.

2177
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.600
What's the point of being a corporate cash?

2178
01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:25.290
The pope was going to war with the Mongols.

2179
01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.130
Yeah,

2180
01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:26.311
no,

2181
01:04:26.311 --> 01:04:27.870
actually the pope went to war with the Romans.

2182
01:04:27.871 --> 01:04:28.560
Right.

2183
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.580
Does it who went through war?

2184
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:32.250
The popo let it all [inaudible] of course.

2185
01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:32.431
Yeah.

2186
01:04:32.431 --> 01:04:36.210
There were guys Elian of these stories where sometime before they became pope

2187
01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.470
they were like Janet Larson shapes as loader,

2188
01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:43.460
a whole town and that adventure or a whole town and become a pope sometime

2189
01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:47.520
sometime when they were actually popes pope and being a priest in general

2190
01:04:47.521 --> 01:04:48.450
becomes so gay.

2191
01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.790
Not to say anything wrong with that,

2192
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.640
but I think like throw out,

2193
01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:56.460
it was the only cover that you add if you need them to have a eight data with

2194
01:04:56.461 --> 01:04:59.950
sexuality where he'll get married and you just have Keach and don't have that

2195
01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:00.240
shaky.

2196
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.010
She just wasn't in year one.

2197
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:03.030
You couldn't fake it.

2198
01:05:03.031 --> 01:05:04.460
And it's not like you had the option of saying,

2199
01:05:04.461 --> 01:05:04.681
no,

2200
01:05:04.681 --> 01:05:05.041
sorry,

2201
01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:05.250
I,

2202
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.350
I'm out of days cause I like to do it's or something.

2203
01:05:07.351 --> 01:05:08.250
You couldn't say that.

2204
01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:11.430
So do you just teach poetry and everybody would just give you a wink and they

2205
01:05:11.431 --> 01:05:12.240
knew what was up.

2206
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.500
Not even because everybody's expected to get married or not married and you

2207
01:05:16.501 --> 01:05:17.230
don't have kids.

2208
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:18.040
The fuck is wrong with you.

2209
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:18.910
<v 5>If you become a priest,</v>

2210
01:05:18.911 --> 01:05:20.050
he's your only cover is,

2211
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:20.260
oh,

2212
01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:20.591
because it's,

2213
01:05:20.591 --> 01:05:21.700
I mean the service of God.

2214
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.080
Then it's like,

2215
01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:23.381
oh,

2216
01:05:23.381 --> 01:05:23.741
okay.

2217
01:05:23.741 --> 01:05:24.700
That's why you don't touch.

2218
01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:25.480
We meant and stuff.

2219
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.210
How many men back then must have had beards,

2220
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:29.291
beards,

2221
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:29.950
meanings,

2222
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:32.140
wives that weren't really their wife.

2223
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.710
They just,

2224
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:34.330
they had a why just for the,

2225
01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:35.710
even fucked her and got her pregnant healthworks.

2226
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:36.221
Really?

2227
01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:36.581
They would just,

2228
01:05:36.581 --> 01:05:41.190
how can boody every night planning to plan to plan far toward world.

2229
01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:45.580
That's only 15 hundreds of total thing that Martin Luther Shit was nuts.

2230
01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.410
Yup.

2231
01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:47.110
MMM.

2232
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:50.230
And that people that didn't think he took it far enough.

2233
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:50.850
Yeah,

2234
01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:52.510
they took it to another level.

2235
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.140
Right.

2236
01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.990
What was it called again and the one that had a baptism.

2237
01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:56.771
Baptism.

2238
01:05:56.771 --> 01:05:56.951
Yeah.

2239
01:05:56.951 --> 01:05:59.380
And even those guys that are like so many subdivision,

2240
01:05:59.381 --> 01:06:00.670
that's why this thing gets so crazy.

2241
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:01.653
Cause you know,

2242
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.740
most of those guys are hardcore pacifist to sort of read the New Testament in a

2243
01:06:05.741 --> 01:06:06.400
very literal,

2244
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:06.701
you know,

2245
01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:07.840
turn the other cheek,

2246
01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:11.860
love your enemies so they wouldn't fight under any conditions.

2247
01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.480
But then there were some guys who decided,

2248
01:06:13.481 --> 01:06:15.850
well I liked Sam of your interpretation,

2249
01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:20.680
which was the more brutal pooler semi communist interpretation of the New

2250
01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.160
Testament.

2251
01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.620
But these peaceful shit.

2252
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.231
Yeah,

2253
01:06:23.231 --> 01:06:23.990
I don't like that pirates.

2254
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:28.630
So we'll just go forward a hardcore but oh poo or pro communist approach by,

2255
01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.150
we'll just bash bust outside selling the way people's thing.

2256
01:06:32.151 --> 01:06:32.830
Exactly.

2257
01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:36.960
They decided that there would be no private property and they wanted to own,

2258
01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.040
but like no one should be able to own anything.

2259
01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:39.221
You know,

2260
01:06:39.221 --> 01:06:40.670
just like we all enjoy fire.

2261
01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:42.020
We all enjoy the sun.

2262
01:06:42.021 --> 01:06:43.750
Like they were going deep.

2263
01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.370
Some of the stories that are just,

2264
01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:47.800
you can't believe that people go along with you.

2265
01:06:47.850 --> 01:06:48.060
Well,

2266
01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:52.600
I can't believe that in 1500 you couldn't even read a Bible.

2267
01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:53.951
That is amazing.

2268
01:06:53.951 --> 01:06:54.790
I didn't know that.

2269
01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:59.110
And that give you an idea of how much of an institution designed to control

2270
01:06:59.111 --> 01:06:59.560
people.

2271
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.620
The Catholic Church was fired.

2272
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:02.321
I'm mad at ease.

2273
01:07:02.321 --> 01:07:05.800
It just how you can get away with it since the beginning of time.

2274
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:06.400
Yeah,

2275
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:06.581
no,

2276
01:07:06.581 --> 01:07:07.091
it's crazy.

2277
01:07:07.091 --> 01:07:08.200
It really is insane.

2278
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:11.800
And in that sense that was the coolest thing about Martin Luther is about

2279
01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:12.730
pushing these.

2280
01:07:12.731 --> 01:07:15.520
Everybody can make it decide for themselves,

2281
01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.190
which sound very sweet and Democrat.

2282
01:07:17.191 --> 01:07:17.471
I take it.

2283
01:07:17.471 --> 01:07:22.100
But the problem is that then when he started realizing that either people were

2284
01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:25.570
interpreting the Bible in ways that were completely unlike he's,

2285
01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:26.730
he was justice piece.

2286
01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.850
There's the Catholic with them.

2287
01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:28.211
It's like,

2288
01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:28.451
no,

2289
01:07:28.451 --> 01:07:30.520
I meant Fredo from the Catholic interpretation.

2290
01:07:30.521 --> 01:07:32.020
I didn't mean to really make up your own.

2291
01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:32.521
That's sub.

2292
01:07:32.521 --> 01:07:33.101
We are shit.

2293
01:07:33.101 --> 01:07:36.350
They are interpreted narrow who don't do that and put all of this done,

2294
01:07:36.351 --> 01:07:39.920
start to burdening people at the stake just as much as Catholics who are doing

2295
01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:40.571
it well.

2296
01:07:40.571 --> 01:07:42.610
That was the big time for Brandon people.

2297
01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:42.811
Yeah.

2298
01:07:42.811 --> 01:07:43.151
The Guy,

2299
01:07:43.151 --> 01:07:43.901
John Calvin,

2300
01:07:43.901 --> 01:07:47.680
like the sacrum major Fieger beside Martin Luther among the Protestants.

2301
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:51.250
He was so pissed with this one guy because he denied the trinity.

2302
01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:52.870
You know the father song.

2303
01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:57.070
It goes thing that he had been burned at the stake and when they were bringing

2304
01:07:57.071 --> 01:07:58.510
the wood to set him on fire,

2305
01:07:58.511 --> 01:07:58.760
he said,

2306
01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:58.900
no,

2307
01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.091
no,

2308
01:07:59.091 --> 01:07:59.860
not that word.

2309
01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:00.521
That's dry.

2310
01:08:00.521 --> 01:08:01.480
He's going to burn up quick.

2311
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:02.470
I want in Greenwood.

2312
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.260
I want this motherfucker to last a long time.

2313
01:08:05.261 --> 01:08:07.950
That God really,

2314
01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:09.260
that's the guy who was tired.

2315
01:08:09.261 --> 01:08:11.440
A huge branch of Protestantism.

2316
01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:12.700
He's Greenwood.

2317
01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:13.151
Yeah,

2318
01:08:13.151 --> 01:08:14.860
cause that weight eat longer.

2319
01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:15.920
Long time.

2320
01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:16.130
Yup.

2321
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.250
They cooked the guy to death with Greenwood.

2322
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.750
I could just see a slow fire cooking your feet,

2323
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:25.670
which is like Oh mother fucker to you have to be too watery.

2324
01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:27.143
Diarrhea.

2325
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:28.191
Yeah.

2326
01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:30.320
There was a lot of green mountain grill.

2327
01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:31.880
I met the owner by the way,

2328
01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:32.960
within a Sacramento.

2329
01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:33.581
Oh did you?

2330
01:08:33.581 --> 01:08:37.340
We went drinking and got wasted at some wasted with the owner of green mountain

2331
01:08:37.341 --> 01:08:37.900
grill.

2332
01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:38.780
It's a great grill.

2333
01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.100
I think she's mine the other night.

2334
01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.240
I love it.

2335
01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.220
I cooked some of the last of my venison sausage.

2336
01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:44.150
This is amazing.

2337
01:08:44.151 --> 01:08:46.970
It's so cause you keep the temperature of the same.

2338
01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:51.050
We went from Martin Luther and we're going to talk about cooking people.

2339
01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:51.531
Well,

2340
01:08:51.531 --> 01:08:52.364
yeah.

2341
01:08:53.610 --> 01:08:57.080
That is a fucked up part about history as the cruelty that people were willing

2342
01:08:57.081 --> 01:08:58.850
to do to their fellow man.

2343
01:08:59.200 --> 01:08:59.540
You know,

2344
01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:03.620
it can just feel years ago in the name of ideology.

2345
01:09:03.850 --> 01:09:05.600
I mean this is not even the stuff where he's like,

2346
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:06.020
Amen.

2347
01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:07.460
You have a lot of cool gold.

2348
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:08.323
I wanted,

2349
01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.280
sorry luck.

2350
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:11.270
I'll bash bashers Coleen cause I want to take it.

2351
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.411
It's not nice,

2352
01:09:12.411 --> 01:09:13.700
but you can see a logic to it.

2353
01:09:13.701 --> 01:09:16.070
At least this is about some,

2354
01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.720
you don't believe in the trinity.

2355
01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.160
That's what I'm going to burn you to that.

2356
01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:20.810
Are you fucking kidding me?

2357
01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:21.651
Really?

2358
01:09:21.651 --> 01:09:22.790
That's what we argue about.

2359
01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:23.481
The father,

2360
01:09:23.481 --> 01:09:24.560
the son and the holy girls.

2361
01:09:24.561 --> 01:09:24.920
Yeah.

2362
01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.360
Your daughters raped killer.

2363
01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:28.850
Well there wasn't a Catholic church.

2364
01:09:28.851 --> 01:09:30.800
That's more of a Islamic approach,

2365
01:09:30.801 --> 01:09:31.090
right?

2366
01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:31.230
Yeah.

2367
01:09:31.230 --> 01:09:32.063
I mean,

2368
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:36.530
but the thing is that what scares me to me is not even one group or the other is

2369
01:09:36.531 --> 01:09:38.270
like anybody who will put side,

2370
01:09:38.271 --> 01:09:40.970
they all g I bill of a reality.

2371
01:09:40.971 --> 01:09:42.260
Individuals around them,

2372
01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:44.690
anybody will go towards anybody.

2373
01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:45.231
In that sense.

2374
01:09:45.231 --> 01:09:46.100
To me ideology,

2375
01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:49.250
any kind of ideology in that sense is that disease because the radio then

2376
01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:52.190
interpreting life by looking at what really is going on,

2377
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:54.380
you're trying to interpret it to this field.

2378
01:09:54.381 --> 01:09:59.330
They're off your debts to feed my preconceived notion of the universe and life

2379
01:09:59.331 --> 01:09:59.611
does,

2380
01:09:59.611 --> 01:10:01.130
and then there's something wrong with life.

2381
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:04.400
I'm going to disregard a tabby dance cause I got it all figured out.

2382
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:08.600
It can be beneficial if you follow a really positive ideology,

2383
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:11.660
but just following an ideology itself is so dangerous.

2384
01:10:11.661 --> 01:10:12.470
Yep.

2385
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:17.030
It's like the idea that one person or one idea,

2386
01:10:17.031 --> 01:10:19.700
one thought will prevail above all,

2387
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:23.210
despite rational changes in your environment,

2388
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:24.530
changes around you.

2389
01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:25.620
When,

2390
01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:27.920
when and that's what a religion really is a religion.

2391
01:10:27.921 --> 01:10:28.930
It's an ideology that's,

2392
01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.680
that's where it really becomes a problem.

2393
01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:33.770
We get locked into those too easy for some reason.

2394
01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.900
It's like a broken circuit.

2395
01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:36.720
We have like,

2396
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:36.910
you know,

2397
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:38.360
it's me and it's like we have like a,

2398
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.433
a defect.

2399
01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.090
I think life is too complex for most people to deal with.

2400
01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:44.540
There are too many exceptions.

2401
01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:46.340
There's too much change going on.

2402
01:10:46.341 --> 01:10:50.210
So what was working yesterday may not work today and it's too much.

2403
01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:51.320
It's too much work.

2404
01:10:51.321 --> 01:10:52.520
People don't want to deal with it.

2405
01:10:52.521 --> 01:10:56.180
So one of the things that people dig is the ability to have some solid dogma to

2406
01:10:56.181 --> 01:10:57.020
fall back on.

2407
01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.730
That is reassuring,

2408
01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:00.560
makes them feel good about life.

2409
01:11:00.561 --> 01:11:04.760
It makes them feel like I know what's going on as opposed to be constantly on

2410
01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:06.800
the boulder and if you go to Saint [inaudible] as you'll go.

2411
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.790
Yeah.

2412
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:10.160
Especially folks that seem to have,

2413
01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:10.701
you know,

2414
01:11:10.701 --> 01:11:14.530
like a little extra fear or a less curiosity

2415
01:11:14.530 --> 01:11:16.090
<v 1>or they get tired easier,</v>

2416
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.501
you know,

2417
01:11:16.501 --> 01:11:18.580
it's so easier for them to just a lock on it.

2418
01:11:18.581 --> 01:11:21.780
So I'm going also be easier for people that are mentally ill to lock onto

2419
01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:22.540
something.

2420
01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:26.050
That's the one of the weirdest things when you see obviously mentally ill person

2421
01:11:26.051 --> 01:11:27.530
screaming fire and brimstone.

2422
01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:32.631
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

2423
01:11:32.631 --> 01:11:32.781
no,

2424
01:11:32.781 --> 01:11:33.650
you're right on that.

2425
01:11:33.651 --> 01:11:37.250
And he's hilarious how people applied to every aspect of life,

2426
01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.770
even when they are not that flat out crazy,

2427
01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.450
but just a couple of degrees lower.

2428
01:11:41.451 --> 01:11:46.451
That desire for owning the through 10 for my philosophy is the Shemps in martial

2429
01:11:47.541 --> 01:11:48.370
arts is the same crop,

2430
01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:48.630
right?

2431
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:50.540
It'd be for MMA before,

2432
01:11:50.541 --> 01:11:51.171
but it was slowly,

2433
01:11:51.171 --> 01:11:52.130
everybody was like,

2434
01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:53.600
Judah is the shit.

2435
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:55.400
Fuck her at it doesn't you guys suck.

2436
01:11:55.401 --> 01:11:57.550
And it wasn't the same mentality that's organized it.

2437
01:11:57.551 --> 01:11:58.490
Or the John Savage,

2438
01:11:58.491 --> 01:12:01.760
the same mentality that I got the throat,

2439
01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.110
everybody else must be wrong.

2440
01:12:03.111 --> 01:12:06.310
Then I'm going to defend it against all evidence no matter what.

2441
01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:06.711
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2442
01:12:06.711 --> 01:12:07.910
martial arts are very caught,

2443
01:12:07.911 --> 01:12:12.470
like a lot of the traditional martial arts and although I benefited a lot from

2444
01:12:12.471 --> 01:12:12.741
that,

2445
01:12:12.741 --> 01:12:14.630
I was definitely locked in.

2446
01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:14.991
It's just,

2447
01:12:14.991 --> 01:12:18.170
I was lucky that it was very positive and it was beneficial towards me,

2448
01:12:18.171 --> 01:12:19.730
but it was all bowing.

2449
01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:20.990
Every was sir.

2450
01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:21.411
You know,

2451
01:12:21.411 --> 01:12:24.050
you wear a special outfit when you walked into the place,

2452
01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:28.220
certain words you would use and you know there's like,

2453
01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.090
there's a lot of mind control to it.

2454
01:12:30.091 --> 01:12:31.220
It wasn't just discipline,

2455
01:12:31.221 --> 01:12:35.870
it was also like they were instilling a program in your mind and if you accepted

2456
01:12:35.871 --> 01:12:38.330
that program and make you more efficient fighter,

2457
01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:39.000
right,

2458
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:39.831
make you more efficient,

2459
01:12:39.831 --> 01:12:40.140
killer,

2460
01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.210
make you more disciplined.

2461
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:46.480
<v 5>And that's the beauty of a MMA is when everybody was claiming this stuff.</v>

2462
01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:47.343
If the,

2463
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:47.830
you know,

2464
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:48.940
they went with,

2465
01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:50.710
they built to call it in so many ways,

2466
01:12:50.711 --> 01:12:53.800
you know any 30 shirt on martial arts to be able to call it in terms of cult of

2467
01:12:53.801 --> 01:12:56.550
personality and a wise master,

2468
01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:56.950
who knows.

2469
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:57.551
Avidly seeing,

2470
01:12:57.551 --> 01:13:00.610
I know all these rules are designed to increase the sense of Hyatt Iraqi

2471
01:13:00.611 --> 01:13:03.440
sometime and it seems like UFC,

2472
01:13:03.441 --> 01:13:04.750
he's like well prove it,

2473
01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:08.830
which is almost blasphemers if you say it and more 30 Chanel call and text where

2474
01:13:09.450 --> 01:13:10.420
you are not saying it,

2475
01:13:10.421 --> 01:13:13.240
that's a challenge or not telling somebody to fuck off by your saying Amen.

2476
01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:14.500
That sounds like a cool tod.

2477
01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:15.603
Show me.

2478
01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:19.010
Show me that he walks on their pressure under the real pressure,

2479
01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.570
the actual fight that's as close to emulating an actual fight is you can get

2480
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:23.020
yeah.

2481
01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:25.770
And that stuff in Moss 30 shouldn't allow elements.

2482
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:30.340
Liking Monster Legions is blast for me to say that you're questioning to master

2483
01:13:30.341 --> 01:13:31.174
you are doing

2484
01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.270
question is the healthiest thing,

2485
01:13:34.271 --> 01:13:34.541
man.

2486
01:13:34.541 --> 01:13:36.490
It's like I'm giving him a chance to prove it.

2487
01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.380
<v 1>That doesn't work anymore.</v>

2488
01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.130
That's that whole idea that you can't question that that's out.

2489
01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:41.980
That one's out.

2490
01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:42.580
That one's out.

2491
01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:43.120
That's done.

2492
01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.550
Anybody tells you not to question question that guy.

2493
01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.000
Right?

2494
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:46.820
Because that's a mess.

2495
01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:47.180
Yup.

2496
01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:47.360
Oh,

2497
01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.120
who the fuck are you that you can't be questioned?

2498
01:13:49.150 --> 01:13:51.250
Are you an alien from another planet right now?

2499
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:52.210
Either perfect being,

2500
01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:53.320
are you doctor Manhattan,

2501
01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:54.100
right?

2502
01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:54.551
No.

2503
01:13:54.551 --> 01:13:55.384
Right.

2504
01:13:56.210 --> 01:13:56.400
No,

2505
01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:56.761
you're not.

2506
01:13:56.761 --> 01:13:57.594
You're silly bitch.

2507
01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:04.690
<v 5>And that's exactly where I was going with the new book that I,</v>

2508
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:07.840
<v 1>the new book is called create your own religion.</v>

2509
01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:08.853
And uh,

2510
01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:10.121
um,

2511
01:14:10.121 --> 01:14:12.030
what is it on what a publishing company

2512
01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.830
<v 5>is a subset of ways.</v>

2513
01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:16.100
Everybody.

2514
01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:16.570
Yes.

2515
01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:17.100
Yeah.

2516
01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:21.860
This info.com I have the pulse of the original disinfect books and that,

2517
01:14:21.861 --> 01:14:22.694
you know,

2518
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:23.840
you're being lied to.

2519
01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:25.123
That's a great book.

2520
01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:25.970
Love ever.

2521
01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:26.301
That's a,

2522
01:14:26.301 --> 01:14:27.260
that's about some stuff.

2523
01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:28.430
You read that book and you're like,

2524
01:14:28.431 --> 01:14:29.121
what the fuck?

2525
01:14:29.121 --> 01:14:31.490
That was like sort of almost pre internet,

2526
01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:32.750
you know?

2527
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:33.531
I mean it was,

2528
01:14:33.531 --> 01:14:34.850
it was a part of the Internet movement,

2529
01:14:34.851 --> 01:14:37.820
but having that book around it was like if you went over someone's house and you

2530
01:14:37.821 --> 01:14:39.030
saw that you were being lied to you,

2531
01:14:39.031 --> 01:14:39.980
like all right man,

2532
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:42.890
like me brother.

2533
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:43.760
Yeah.

2534
01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.640
You know how the man has been lying to you as well,

2535
01:14:48.170 --> 01:14:48.651
Danny.

2536
01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:48.951
Yeah.

2537
01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:50.430
Liberal La.

2538
01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:51.261
Um,

2539
01:14:51.261 --> 01:14:55.280
so create your own religion is what is the concept behind it is just to add all

2540
01:14:55.281 --> 01:14:59.330
the best parts to all the different ideologies that you've ever found and just

2541
01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:00.890
sort of Bruce Lee at all.

2542
01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:02.390
That's exactly what it takes.

2543
01:15:02.391 --> 01:15:04.600
These d I May may approach to the leader on it.

2544
01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:08.360
Watch the way I may may Stein's through 30 for not martial arts.

2545
01:15:08.361 --> 01:15:09.590
It's like these approaches,

2546
01:15:09.591 --> 01:15:11.720
what's tends to regular religions,

2547
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:13.970
which is not,

2548
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:16.430
not all the good stuff come from the same place.

2549
01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.110
You need to look at multiple places.

2550
01:15:18.111 --> 01:15:18.891
You need to test it.

2551
01:15:18.891 --> 01:15:19.850
You need to see what works,

2552
01:15:19.851 --> 01:15:20.684
what doesn't.

2553
01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:21.500
And the radar,

2554
01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:22.191
I'm being like,

2555
01:15:22.191 --> 01:15:23.360
Christianity sucks.

2556
01:15:23.361 --> 01:15:23.871
Or it's like,

2557
01:15:23.871 --> 01:15:24.230
it's like,

2558
01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:24.620
try it.

2559
01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:25.490
Try some seeings,

2560
01:15:25.491 --> 01:15:26.990
maybe 80% of feet.

2561
01:15:26.991 --> 01:15:29.150
You think these crazy bullshit that make no sense,

2562
01:15:29.151 --> 01:15:32.090
but you find a couple of times that you can help you in life.

2563
01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:32.983
Then use them.

2564
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.680
Why not?

2565
01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:35.310
It doesn't mean I'm marrying the ideology,

2566
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:38.450
but I'm going to take whatever I can use to make like to me,

2567
01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:39.920
the only thing that met their cs,

2568
01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:41.750
elevating the quality of life.

2569
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:43.580
If you're elevating the quality of life,

2570
01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:47.030
I don't give a fuck where you've got the source things for formation from.

2571
01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.280
That's not what it's about is where it's leading.

2572
01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:49.911
Uh,

2573
01:15:49.911 --> 01:15:51.860
what kind of results does it create?

2574
01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:53.500
That's what interests me,

2575
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:56.050
which is exactly the MMA mentalities.

2576
01:15:56.051 --> 01:15:59.720
It doesn't matter whether it technique is judo or karate or boxing or whatever

2577
01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:00.740
the fuck if he works,

2578
01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:01.410
he works.

2579
01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:01.680
Yeah.

2580
01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:05.460
<v 1>That's one of the things about human beings ultimately is that we need someone</v>

2581
01:16:05.461 --> 01:16:06.810
to lead by example.

2582
01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:07.411
You know,

2583
01:16:07.411 --> 01:16:09.930
you can't just get up and tell us how to do things.

2584
01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.370
You can't just get up and tell us.

2585
01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:12.600
That's why people,

2586
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:17.630
especially in especially should be really distrusting of politicians.

2587
01:16:18.331 --> 01:16:20.290
In 2013 you should,

2588
01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:25.350
the way human beings should talk should be explaining what they've learned from

2589
01:16:25.351 --> 01:16:26.340
their own experiences.

2590
01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:28.650
It should not be telling people what they should do.

2591
01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:29.430
Exactly.

2592
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:32.080
It should be learning from your own experiences telling you.

2593
01:16:32.081 --> 01:16:33.720
And if you don't have any experiences,

2594
01:16:33.721 --> 01:16:36.870
if you don't have any really unique experiences are really unique thoughts and

2595
01:16:36.871 --> 01:16:37.590
experiences,

2596
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:40.050
why the fuck would you think that you should be able to lead?

2597
01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:41.250
But you're,

2598
01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:45.690
you're trying to lead because you're saying the words the right way and you're

2599
01:16:45.691 --> 01:16:48.750
saying the things that the polls say that people want to hear.

2600
01:16:48.751 --> 01:16:51.690
But as far as like unique individual thoughts like this shit,

2601
01:16:51.691 --> 01:16:52.920
like I have a dream,

2602
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:54.420
but you could hear today and you go,

2603
01:16:54.421 --> 01:16:57.030
that motherfucker just nailed it and he just nailed it.

2604
01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:59.040
Martin Luther King nailed it.

2605
01:16:59.610 --> 01:17:02.670
Or Kennedy's speech about secret societies,

2606
01:17:02.671 --> 01:17:03.180
you know,

2607
01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:07.230
or any of his speeches he has of a bunch of brilliant speeches where the guy

2608
01:17:07.231 --> 01:17:07.890
just,

2609
01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:08.790
it made sense.

2610
01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:09.080
You're,

2611
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.070
you're dealing with a unique

2612
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.581
<v 5>individual.</v>

2613
01:17:10.581 --> 01:17:13.580
You're dealing with a person with great intelligence and yet you're dealing with

2614
01:17:13.581 --> 01:17:15.380
a person that you should be paying attention to.

2615
01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:21.500
And those people [inaudible] they are both colicky and humble at the same time.

2616
01:17:22.581 --> 01:17:25.580
Cause you know there's a certain caulking and Salah Bruce Lida comes from,

2617
01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:28.010
you are a bad motherfucker and you have noise because you to be,

2618
01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:29.330
it seems that no one else is doing,

2619
01:17:29.331 --> 01:17:33.470
but at the same time you'll know your limits reality while you'll see all the

2620
01:17:33.471 --> 01:17:36.140
times when stuff that you do and say it doesn't work.

2621
01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:38.060
It boils down to being honest with oneself,

2622
01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:43.370
which means knee Derek pumping yourself up or faking the modesty because you're,

2623
01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:44.960
it's like this is how it is.

2624
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:46.310
This is the stuff that I do.

2625
01:17:46.311 --> 01:17:46.580
Well.

2626
01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:47.660
This is the stuff where I,

2627
01:17:47.690 --> 01:17:51.230
my Expedia on stops right there and I don't know anything beyond that or,

2628
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:56.450
and even experience people got into this trip of like making perfect sense of

2629
01:17:56.451 --> 01:17:56.750
it,

2630
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:57.110
right?

2631
01:17:57.110 --> 01:18:00.980
This is the event and I'm going to derive 12 lessons from it.

2632
01:18:00.981 --> 01:18:02.660
And it's like sometimes you can,

2633
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:04.040
sometime he's just like,

2634
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:06.200
that's my experience and he's fucking mind blowing.

2635
01:18:06.201 --> 01:18:08.300
And I don't know exactly what to make of it.

2636
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:09.290
And that's how honest,

2637
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.651
Ya know,

2638
01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:13.760
it's like looking at what since that happened at radio [inaudible] with deet

2639
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:17.000
beyond what Experian warrants that you just our knowledge what happened,

2640
01:18:17.001 --> 01:18:17.631
you are knowledge,

2641
01:18:17.631 --> 01:18:20.210
what you derive from it and keep an open mind.

2642
01:18:20.211 --> 01:18:25.211
The fact that there's probably more to it now your idea about this book is this

2643
01:18:25.761 --> 01:18:28.070
just to pick out all the cool shit that you've learned,

2644
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:31.850
all that cool shit that you've found and you're studying and have you studied

2645
01:18:31.851 --> 01:18:33.740
religion for health for a bunch?

2646
01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.760
And um,

2647
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:35.623
to me it's like,

2648
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:38.270
at the end of the day it doesn't matter what I'm teaching.

2649
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:41.780
I always end up talking about the same stuff whether I'm talking about,

2650
01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.260
I start from American India and he stole your religion or martial arts.

2651
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:48.020
I ended up talking about the same things because they are the stuff that life is

2652
01:18:48.021 --> 01:18:48.854
made of.

2653
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:49.491
Uh,

2654
01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:50.600
the coolest Olympics,

2655
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:51.643
sex,

2656
01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:52.160
gender,

2657
01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:52.970
rose.

2658
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:56.450
Talk about sex and gender roles.

2659
01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:56.860
Yeah.

2660
01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:57.710
All good stuff.

2661
01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:00.380
Is there a way to the throat,

2662
01:19:00.381 --> 01:19:02.230
is there multiple where it's like Ed,

2663
01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.680
the relationship with death and dying?

2664
01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:08.090
I do a deal with that I would do you deal with the physical world with your own

2665
01:19:08.091 --> 01:19:08.361
body?

2666
01:19:08.361 --> 01:19:09.980
I mean the big topics are always the same.

2667
01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:14.150
They don't change the SBC fee kicks samples that you get there from may differ.

2668
01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:15.291
So to me,

2669
01:19:15.291 --> 01:19:20.060
I pick like a chapter each on some of the big things for me to seeing steady my

2670
01:19:20.061 --> 01:19:20.421
mind,

2671
01:19:20.421 --> 01:19:25.010
any human being need to find a need to decide where they stand on some of these

2672
01:19:25.011 --> 01:19:25.844
issues.

2673
01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:27.350
And I look at what's out there.

2674
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:31.610
Some answers make no sense to me and they seem to lead down really on a healthy

2675
01:19:31.611 --> 01:19:31.940
path.

2676
01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:32.810
So thank you.

2677
01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:33.700
But no thanks.

2678
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:37.580
Other answers make more sense or maybe they don't and I come up with my own,

2679
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:38.750
but he's basic.

2680
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:40.620
It really is boiled down to the Bruce Lee,

2681
01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.150
you know,

2682
01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:42.740
research your own experience,

2683
01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:43.100
uh,

2684
01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:43.820
reject what is,

2685
01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:47.630
he was less absorb what is useful and what's specific a year on,

2686
01:19:47.631 --> 01:19:47.871
you know,

2687
01:19:47.871 --> 01:19:51.290
his basic methodology for how to approach knowledge.

2688
01:19:51.291 --> 01:19:52.880
I mean he applied it to martial arts,

2689
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:55.910
but really say but alien way of approach.

2690
01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:57.410
Just any kind of knowledge,

2691
01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:58.341
whether it's really,

2692
01:19:58.341 --> 01:20:00.550
it's about life and yeah,

2693
01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:01.940
it's hard for people to accept that.

2694
01:20:01.941 --> 01:20:02.310
Right?

2695
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:05.780
So it's much easier to follow the pattern that your family's fouled.

2696
01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.000
I'm a Lutheran because of grandma's Lutheran.

2697
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:08.250
<v 2>Right.</v>

2698
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:10.320
GRANDPA always said that no matter what,

2699
01:20:10.321 --> 01:20:11.370
we'll be Lutherans.

2700
01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:11.820
Yep.

2701
01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.230
I remember talking to his girl and,

2702
01:20:13.231 --> 01:20:13.590
uh,

2703
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:16.290
she said that she was going to get a tattoo of a cross.

2704
01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.191
And I said,

2705
01:20:17.191 --> 01:20:17.760
uh,

2706
01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.180
I said,

2707
01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:18.600
oh,

2708
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:18.931
I go,

2709
01:20:18.931 --> 01:20:19.800
you really religious?

2710
01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:20.370
She goes,

2711
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:20.581
well,

2712
01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:21.091
not really,

2713
01:20:21.091 --> 01:20:21.930
but you know what?

2714
01:20:21.931 --> 01:20:25.020
I was born Catholic and I figured that no matter what,

2715
01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:27.120
that's the one thing that'll be for the rest of my life,

2716
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:28.350
the fuck.

2717
01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:28.890
I mean,

2718
01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:29.820
and I remember saying,

2719
01:20:29.821 --> 01:20:30.600
and I'm like,

2720
01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:30.901
you know,

2721
01:20:30.901 --> 01:20:31.800
I didn't know her very well,

2722
01:20:31.801 --> 01:20:32.310
so I was like,

2723
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:33.143
okay,

2724
01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:33.930
um,

2725
01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:34.650
how do you know?

2726
01:20:34.650 --> 01:20:34.861
Like,

2727
01:20:34.861 --> 01:20:36.510
how do you know you won't change your mind about that?

2728
01:20:36.511 --> 01:20:36.901
And she's like,

2729
01:20:36.901 --> 01:20:37.440
oh my God,

2730
01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.370
my family would kill me.

2731
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.930
And I was like,

2732
01:20:42.930 --> 01:20:43.261
oh,

2733
01:20:43.261 --> 01:20:43.531
okay.

2734
01:20:43.531 --> 01:20:44.610
Well good luck with that.

2735
01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:46.440
Good luck with that.

2736
01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.393
Wow.

2737
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:51.690
Is that he had at World War Two gun different,

2738
01:20:51.691 --> 01:20:52.381
they would be people.

2739
01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:52.920
Today's like,

2740
01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:53.110
no,

2741
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:54.110
I'm not really nadZ ,

2742
01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:54.601
but you know,

2743
01:20:54.601 --> 01:20:57.900
if I don't put the shots stick on my grandma would her feeding so we'll get

2744
01:20:57.901 --> 01:20:58.590
really hard.

2745
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:59.161
And so it's,

2746
01:20:59.161 --> 01:21:00.480
I don't hate the Jews,

2747
01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:01.680
but grandma fucking hates Jews.

2748
01:21:02.050 --> 01:21:02.883
I love grandma.

2749
01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:03.380
Yeah,

2750
01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:03.870
exactly.

2751
01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:05.880
You know it's like I don't want to make them sad.

2752
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:08.910
You know what's hilarious is that she was going to get a Catholic tattoo in the

2753
01:21:08.911 --> 01:21:12.270
first place because like in the Bible it very specifically says

2754
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.220
so like getting a religious tattoo.

2755
01:21:17.221 --> 01:21:17.760
It's like,

2756
01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.170
well you're not listening to me.

2757
01:21:19.171 --> 01:21:19.500
Yeah,

2758
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:20.011
no,

2759
01:21:20.011 --> 01:21:21.660
only I listened when it's convenient,

2760
01:21:21.661 --> 01:21:23.880
but across tattoo is so sexy.

2761
01:21:23.881 --> 01:21:27.000
It makes me look spiritual and it thins out my back.

2762
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:30.310
And that's the other point of like the people who got pissed when you are

2763
01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:31.290
cutting eight year old,

2764
01:21:31.291 --> 01:21:31.561
he's like,

2765
01:21:31.561 --> 01:21:32.670
what do you mean create your own?

2766
01:21:32.671 --> 01:21:33.121
It's not,

2767
01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:35.910
there are some absolute truths that full from heaven.

2768
01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.650
They stop those people.

2769
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:40.140
People that are making up their own shit anyway.

2770
01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:43.490
I mean when people say they little Sam thing is bullshit Israeli,

2771
01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:46.680
they are making up their own thing cause the wheel 80 to some parts of that they

2772
01:21:46.681 --> 01:21:47.250
don't like,

2773
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:51.720
they will focus on the parts daylight and pretend that it's the one and all the

2774
01:21:51.721 --> 01:21:54.630
interpretation if you're going to do that,

2775
01:21:54.690 --> 01:21:58.290
might as well be honest and just peek from any source if you are going to be

2776
01:21:58.330 --> 01:21:58.830
continuous.

2777
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:03.830
I think that religion in general in the future is much more likely to be studied

2778
01:22:03.931 --> 01:22:05.760
and lets less likely to be practice.

2779
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:06.080
Right.

2780
01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:11.080
Cause I think in especially in like a really hardcore fundamentalist form,

2781
01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:12.240
yeah,

2782
01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:16.260
it's much less likely that people are going to accept that as time goes on and

2783
01:22:16.261 --> 01:22:20.040
information gets distributed broader and faster.

2784
01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:24.000
But then again people will always be afraid of dying.

2785
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.960
He voted.

2786
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.710
We'd always be afraid of uh,

2787
01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:27.511
where do you know,

2788
01:22:27.511 --> 01:22:28.410
where do we come from?

2789
01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:30.000
Is there any meaning in the universe?

2790
01:22:30.001 --> 01:22:33.930
And pure rationality doesn't give you a very satisfactory answers.

2791
01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:34.793
No,

2792
01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.353
it does not.

2793
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:40.340
So when you want answers and you can get them through rezoning that case,

2794
01:22:40.341 --> 01:22:41.900
it's like well fuck reason.

2795
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:46.110
Then just give me any answer cause I can deal with not having salmon living that

2796
01:22:46.111 --> 01:22:46.351
way.

2797
01:22:46.351 --> 01:22:48.300
I need some solid basis.

2798
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:49.800
I just have a whole bit about that.

2799
01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:50.671
Is that a,

2800
01:22:50.671 --> 01:22:52.050
I would really like to join the call.

2801
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:56.380
If anybody could fucking write one that doesn't make me throw up when I write

2802
01:22:56.381 --> 01:22:57.210
it.

2803
01:22:57.210 --> 01:22:58.080
Just one of you guys.

2804
01:22:58.081 --> 01:23:01.890
It's not like a smart guy out there that can write like some much more

2805
01:23:01.891 --> 01:23:03.100
believable shit.

2806
01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.810
Then Scientology or Mormonism or

2807
01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.130
<v 1>any of the newcomers,</v>

2808
01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.350
you know like those are the,

2809
01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:09.184
the the law,

2810
01:23:09.370 --> 01:23:10.700
the two latest,

2811
01:23:10.730 --> 01:23:11.750
greatest new commerce.

2812
01:23:11.751 --> 01:23:16.100
It really stuck Mormonism and Scientology and they're both fucking cuckoo for

2813
01:23:16.101 --> 01:23:16.934
cocoa puffs.

2814
01:23:17.150 --> 01:23:18.050
You read both of them.

2815
01:23:18.051 --> 01:23:19.040
They're hilarious.

2816
01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.080
There's laminates and shit.

2817
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:24.830
They both have extra planets to both at planets where they know some shit's

2818
01:23:24.831 --> 01:23:25.400
going down.

2819
01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:25.881
Both of them.

2820
01:23:25.881 --> 01:23:27.530
Scientology and Mormonism,

2821
01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:28.970
like cold lob,

2822
01:23:28.971 --> 01:23:29.241
right.

2823
01:23:29.241 --> 01:23:33.010
Isn't that the Mormon planet started or some re

2824
01:23:33.930 --> 01:23:38.930
<v 5>Marvin story is the how 1970s most Mormons believe that direct skiing is a sign</v>

2825
01:23:41.221 --> 01:23:42.390
that God hates your guts.

2826
01:23:42.391 --> 01:23:42.931
Basically.

2827
01:23:42.931 --> 01:23:44.590
That is a wow.

2828
01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:45.710
But you know,

2829
01:23:45.710 --> 01:23:49.380
[inaudible] 1930s that was fairly mainstream view.

2830
01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.360
I wonder what made them change their mind exactly.

2831
01:23:51.361 --> 01:23:54.120
The 1970 suddenly God sent a memo saying,

2832
01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:54.600
wait,

2833
01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:54.811
wait,

2834
01:23:54.811 --> 01:23:55.770
you guys got it wrong?

2835
01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.600
Dark skin is totally cool.

2836
01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:59.040
I have nothing against it.

2837
01:23:59.041 --> 01:24:00.090
You just made a mistake.

2838
01:24:00.091 --> 01:24:03.930
He's like the civil rights movement managed to convince not just millions of

2839
01:24:03.931 --> 01:24:06.790
Americans but God himself that racism is no longer cool.

2840
01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:07.421
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2841
01:24:07.421 --> 01:24:11.770
God didn't understand until he saw Martin Luther King give a speech.

2842
01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.600
That's how strong that I have a dream speeches.

2843
01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:14.640
That's what I do.

2844
01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:15.960
<v 5>Read the whole law three times.</v>

2845
01:24:15.961 --> 01:24:19.080
The teats divinely revealed the falls from the sky one day.

2846
01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.190
It's so funny cause people when it doesn't make sense anymore,

2847
01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:26.340
we'll change it cause it's like I can't really go around saying this shit

2848
01:24:26.341 --> 01:24:26.761
anymore.

2849
01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:27.594
It doesn't.

2850
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:29.430
So where we got it wrong,

2851
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:29.730
God,

2852
01:24:29.730 --> 01:24:30.590
Mandy's other way.

2853
01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.160
Really all along every spring we've been seeing for the last time there,

2854
01:24:33.161 --> 01:24:33.740
DRC,

2855
01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:35.440
just a measly interpret.

2856
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:38.430
You know we miss interpreted thing is God was right.

2857
01:24:38.431 --> 01:24:39.810
We were all of course,

2858
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:41.250
woops.

2859
01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:43.170
Woopsies isn't that like,

2860
01:24:43.171 --> 01:24:43.650
um,

2861
01:24:43.650 --> 01:24:44.080
what,

2862
01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.180
when

2863
01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:50.440
<v 1>Martin Luther translated the Bible to a phonetic form and then the people</v>

2864
01:24:50.441 --> 01:24:52.870
started interpreting it and then like going,

2865
01:24:52.871 --> 01:24:52.991
well,

2866
01:24:52.991 --> 01:24:54.850
how come no one's practicing any of this shit?

2867
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.080
How come you guys are all,

2868
01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:56.860
well,

2869
01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:58.510
why the fuck do you have so much money?

2870
01:24:59.050 --> 01:24:59.561
What's going on?

2871
01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:00.820
Why are we peasants forever?

2872
01:25:00.821 --> 01:25:01.870
It doesn't say that here.

2873
01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:02.710
Like this is,

2874
01:25:02.710 --> 01:25:03.940
you guys made this shit up.

2875
01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:08.170
Like you made all this shit up about being a peasant and ordained a peasant

2876
01:25:08.171 --> 01:25:08.830
forever,

2877
01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:11.860
but then you'll be rewarded for your toils and heaven that's not in here.

2878
01:25:12.110 --> 01:25:12.880
Definitely.

2879
01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:13.691
This isn't saying here.

2880
01:25:13.691 --> 01:25:14.650
You're a peasant for life.

2881
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:19.330
<v 5>That's the part that I have always the most fun in regards to people making up</v>

2882
01:25:19.331 --> 01:25:20.051
their own stuff.

2883
01:25:20.051 --> 01:25:20.350
To me.

2884
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:21.190
We could stay on it.

2885
01:25:21.191 --> 01:25:21.790
He's like,

2886
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:22.750
you want to be Christian?

2887
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:23.080
Hey,

2888
01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:23.920
there's good stuff.

2889
01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:24.760
Hold for it.

2890
01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:27.370
But then our you capitalist at the same time,

2891
01:25:27.371 --> 01:25:30.820
because there are so many passages where they are so hardcore.

2892
01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:31.840
I mean you have the,

2893
01:25:32.230 --> 01:25:33.130
the Jesus,

2894
01:25:33.131 --> 01:25:33.760
uh,

2895
01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:37.630
it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to

2896
01:25:37.631 --> 01:25:38.560
get into heaven,

2897
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:42.250
which is like something that Jesus said that which Damn Jesus,

2898
01:25:42.251 --> 01:25:43.000
that Shit's deep.

2899
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.440
Kyron Marx would blush.

2900
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:45.161
You know what I mean?

2901
01:25:45.161 --> 01:25:46.540
He's like fucking bad.

2902
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:50.770
That fire and that shows up over and over again.

2903
01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:54.940
A bunch of passages that are anti cumulation of wild and says like,

2904
01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:58.060
so you're going to be a Christian but you're going to be hardcore capitalist.

2905
01:25:58.061 --> 01:25:58.390
He's like,

2906
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.631
yeah,

2907
01:25:58.631 --> 01:25:59.710
cause I'm done with Jesus.

2908
01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.120
That part about money.

2909
01:26:01.121 --> 01:26:02.410
I would just skip over those spots.

2910
01:26:02.430 --> 01:26:04.220
So just an focus on some weird

2911
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:08.810
<v 1>interpretational one passage that may seem to say seem that he say something</v>

2912
01:26:08.811 --> 01:26:12.530
else and I'm going to ignore the other 19 where he's clearly state in fuck

2913
01:26:12.531 --> 01:26:13.610
accumulation of wealth.

2914
01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:14.390
Yeah.

2915
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:19.160
That was the other thing that they had found in the translations was that Jesus

2916
01:26:19.161 --> 01:26:20.390
hung out with people like them.

2917
01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:20.960
Yup.

2918
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:25.960
Jesus hung out with the poor and the downtrodden and the prostitutes and that's

2919
01:26:26.151 --> 01:26:27.860
who Jesus was palling around with.

2920
01:26:27.861 --> 01:26:28.110
Like,

2921
01:26:28.110 --> 01:26:30.080
what the fuck have you guys been teaching us?

2922
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:34.370
And so the people that wanted to go even further than Martin Luther,

2923
01:26:34.371 --> 01:26:34.920
these,

2924
01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:35.480
uh,

2925
01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:36.313
Anabaptists,

2926
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.900
I guess,

2927
01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.300
is that anarchy baptist?

2928
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:39.410
Is that a combination of,

2929
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:41.810
is that baptism for a second time?

2930
01:26:41.811 --> 01:26:46.190
Because they rejected the infant baptism cause they said the baby doesn't tie a

2931
01:26:46.191 --> 01:26:46.821
fucking choice.

2932
01:26:46.821 --> 01:26:48.050
It needs to be an adult choice.

2933
01:26:48.051 --> 01:26:51.110
So they would have baptizers and adult when you want to write.

2934
01:26:51.230 --> 01:26:53.010
And then the third baptism was when they drowned you,

2935
01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:54.550
they catch you,

2936
01:26:54.551 --> 01:26:54.960
right.

2937
01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.570
If they catch shooed and uh,

2938
01:26:57.170 --> 01:26:59.390
either you did or Lutheran swore Catholics,

2939
01:26:59.391 --> 01:27:00.230
if they would catch you,

2940
01:27:00.231 --> 01:27:04.450
then they would decide it was their way of being funny was to drown you cncs.

2941
01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:04.821
Oh,

2942
01:27:04.821 --> 01:27:05.870
you would like to baptism.

2943
01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:06.950
We'll give you a third one.

2944
01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:07.280
And,

2945
01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.370
and about,

2946
01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:09.283
you know,

2947
01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:13.700
Anabaptism Anabaptist thinking that just,

2948
01:27:13.701 --> 01:27:16.100
that does sound like an anarchistic,

2949
01:27:16.101 --> 01:27:16.470
you know,

2950
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:17.303
and uh,

2951
01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.290
and they were,

2952
01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:19.490
they were really radical,

2953
01:27:19.491 --> 01:27:19.820
Huh?

2954
01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:22.700
They were there wanted no private property.

2955
01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.310
They wanted free education,

2956
01:27:25.311 --> 01:27:26.300
free healthcare,

2957
01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.280
those damn communists.

2958
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:28.641
Well,

2959
01:27:28.641 --> 01:27:29.474
meanwhile,

2960
01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:30.680
why is that bad?

2961
01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:31.280
Right?

2962
01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:31.580
You know,

2963
01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:32.990
this is what drives me crazy.

2964
01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:37.790
It's not that I don't think that people should be able to have land.

2965
01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:40.190
I definitely think that you should be able to have land.

2966
01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:44.600
But why is it so bad to like say that you shouldn't,

2967
01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:44.960
right?

2968
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.390
Like why is everybody so committed to hanging onto it?

2969
01:27:47.650 --> 01:27:48.241
Cause like what?

2970
01:27:48.241 --> 01:27:48.501
What?

2971
01:27:48.501 --> 01:27:49.640
Let's let's hear this out.

2972
01:27:49.670 --> 01:27:50.031
Okay.

2973
01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:51.020
What if we don't have land?

2974
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:51.883
Let's have it this way.

2975
01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:54.890
What if the world consists of Jamie,

2976
01:27:54.891 --> 01:27:55.610
Brian,

2977
01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:56.600
you and me?

2978
01:27:56.630 --> 01:27:56.961
Okay.

2979
01:27:56.961 --> 01:27:59.960
We're the only four people in my world and it has no,

2980
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:00.620
no one,

2981
01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:01.400
no one left.

2982
01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:01.641
Okay.

2983
01:28:01.641 --> 01:28:05.750
But the good news is we're on Catalina island and that's all there is.

2984
01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:06.973
Um,

2985
01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.590
can we just share what the fuck?

2986
01:28:09.591 --> 01:28:10.700
I'll put my house over here.

2987
01:28:10.701 --> 01:28:11.840
You put your house over there.

2988
01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:12.793
I'll say hi in the morning.

2989
01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:16.970
We got a house on this spot of dirt that gets problematic when you get into the

2990
01:28:16.971 --> 01:28:18.740
300 million people range.

2991
01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.090
That's the fucking problem.

2992
01:28:20.091 --> 01:28:20.390
Yeah.

2993
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:23.690
The problem is it's too God damn many of us and everybody would want a house

2994
01:28:23.691 --> 01:28:24.524
right by the lake,

2995
01:28:25.170 --> 01:28:27.090
by the lake is too many of us do.

2996
01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:27.971
You can't have a house by the lake.

2997
01:28:27.971 --> 01:28:28.400
Right.

2998
01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.091
But come on,

2999
01:28:29.091 --> 01:28:29.301
man.

3000
01:28:29.301 --> 01:28:29.540
Well,

3001
01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:30.380
we were here first.

3002
01:28:30.381 --> 01:28:30.831
So listen,

3003
01:28:30.831 --> 01:28:31.611
this is our land now.

3004
01:28:31.611 --> 01:28:32.960
We have a house by lake man.

3005
01:28:32.961 --> 01:28:33.710
That's fucked up.

3006
01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:34.700
This is our world.

3007
01:28:34.701 --> 01:28:35.451
We're all in this together.

3008
01:28:35.451 --> 01:28:36.410
It is all in this together.

3009
01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:40.070
But I was born in 1947 and I've had this house by the leg and I'm not giving up

3010
01:28:40.071 --> 01:28:41.000
my fucking house by the lake.

3011
01:28:41.001 --> 01:28:41.240
Right?

3012
01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:41.320
What?

3013
01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:42.510
Can I use your house by the lake?

3014
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.771
No,

3015
01:28:42.771 --> 01:28:43.341
you can't bitch.

3016
01:28:43.341 --> 01:28:44.174
I'll shoot you

3017
01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:47.450
this.

3018
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:48.470
Too many of us,

3019
01:28:48.471 --> 01:28:49.850
and there's not enough cool spot.

3020
01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.450
Right.

3021
01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:51.830
That's the real fucking problem.

3022
01:28:51.850 --> 01:28:52.683
Yeah.

3023
01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:55.370
That's not private property.

3024
01:28:55.371 --> 01:28:55.820
Right,

3025
01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:56.631
because really,

3026
01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:58.070
it'd be perfect if we all,

3027
01:28:58.130 --> 01:28:58.963
you know,

3028
01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:00.860
if we all had the use of everything,

3029
01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:01.713
that would be amazing.

3030
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:02.040
You

3031
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:02.371
<v 2>don't have,</v>

3032
01:29:02.371 --> 01:29:04.770
it's not my laptop or my table.

3033
01:29:04.771 --> 01:29:05.521
It's the table.

3034
01:29:05.521 --> 01:29:07.530
It's the laptop because their laptop I can use.

3035
01:29:07.531 --> 01:29:07.651
Yeah,

3036
01:29:07.651 --> 01:29:08.490
you can use that laptop.

3037
01:29:08.491 --> 01:29:08.701
You know?

3038
01:29:08.701 --> 01:29:10.680
It's like if that would be beautiful,

3039
01:29:10.681 --> 01:29:11.400
if that,

3040
01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:12.090
if that worked.

3041
01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:12.570
Right.

3042
01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:13.403
Exactly.

3043
01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:15.800
In utopia land and utopia.

3044
01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.830
It's idea that you know that he's the way you,

3045
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:19.770
you want to look Topia land.

3046
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:20.190
Yeah.

3047
01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:21.650
That's one of the things that I uh,

3048
01:29:22.230 --> 01:29:24.350
that I've always wondered like it,

3049
01:29:24.370 --> 01:29:24.631
we'll,

3050
01:29:24.631 --> 01:29:26.220
will we see a utopia?

3051
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:27.121
Well we see,

3052
01:29:27.121 --> 01:29:27.420
uh,

3053
01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:29.760
like a working utopia in our time,

3054
01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:34.070
a working community where no one's or can't call me Ott.

3055
01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.760
I buy it on a more scale,

3056
01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:39.480
but it would have to start as a community and it would have to,

3057
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:43.710
the best you could do I think is probably a couple of thousand people.

3058
01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:44.460
Yeah.

3059
01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:45.100
Yeah.

3060
01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:46.320
Word started getting wacky.

3061
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.860
Yeah.

3062
01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:50.040
And you would have to like have meetings and everybody would have to really talk

3063
01:29:50.041 --> 01:29:54.300
about let's make sure we avoid all the pitfalls that I fell in all societies

3064
01:29:54.301 --> 01:29:55.134
before us.

3065
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:56.820
Yeah.

3066
01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:57.960
It's serious.

3067
01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:00.000
That's some serious end of the world type shit though.

3068
01:30:00.001 --> 01:30:01.380
That's the only way that would ever happen.

3069
01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:01.921
Right.

3070
01:30:01.921 --> 01:30:04.700
And I guess today there's a better way to go about it.

3071
01:30:04.701 --> 01:30:04.831
Cause.

3072
01:30:04.831 --> 01:30:05.700
Whereas in the past,

3073
01:30:05.701 --> 01:30:06.381
if you do that,

3074
01:30:06.381 --> 01:30:06.551
you,

3075
01:30:06.551 --> 01:30:06.811
you know,

3076
01:30:06.811 --> 01:30:08.160
you ran off into the mountains,

3077
01:30:08.161 --> 01:30:11.920
create your one movie where all of the other bus starts skin.

3078
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:16.860
Today you can have an element of where you have your out community at the same

3079
01:30:16.861 --> 01:30:20.910
time you're in connected to or why they're wired in a way that doesn't isolate

3080
01:30:20.911 --> 01:30:21.001
you.

3081
01:30:21.001 --> 01:30:25.290
It doesn't make you weird and the and of you off from everything else because

3082
01:30:25.291 --> 01:30:27.810
that was always the downside of the small community.

3083
01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:29.520
Danieli bold la Party pooper.

3084
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:31.530
That's what I just heard about your statement

3085
01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.240
called the perfectly okay.

3086
01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:37.260
I was just kidding.

3087
01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.340
That's out for the mountains.

3088
01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.540
That's what I'm saying.

3089
01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:40.171
That's the way it,

3090
01:30:40.171 --> 01:30:40.800
dude.

3091
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.930
Let's do it on elk with spears and shit.

3092
01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:43.950
Nobody could say a word.

3093
01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:46.350
Start our own families.

3094
01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:49.800
You that you don't want to separate from society.

3095
01:30:49.801 --> 01:30:51.210
Society is pretty fucking awesome.

3096
01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:56.480
It's just we need to figure out a way to fix society in and lessen the amount of

3097
01:30:56.551 --> 01:30:57.330
shitty people,

3098
01:30:57.330 --> 01:30:58.620
shitty products,

3099
01:30:58.900 --> 01:30:59.090
the,

3100
01:30:59.090 --> 01:30:59.281
the,

3101
01:30:59.281 --> 01:30:59.461
the,

3102
01:30:59.461 --> 01:30:59.641
the,

3103
01:30:59.641 --> 01:31:01.560
our product of creating human beings.

3104
01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:04.920
We need to figure out a way to make less of those guys in Cleveland,

3105
01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:07.890
that kidnap girls and keeping locked in their basement for 10 years.

3106
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:08.320
Yup.

3107
01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:08.790
That's,

3108
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:10.440
that should be like our number one priority,

3109
01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.290
not curing lack of boners,

3110
01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:13.700
right?

3111
01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:14.533
Yeah.

3112
01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.490
Not arresting people for funding,

3113
01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:20.470
<v 1>selling boner pills at seven 11 either Brian or do you do about that?</v>

3114
01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:21.210
They need to cut it.

3115
01:31:21.210 --> 01:31:25.120
They came in and they busted all of those and it was exactly as Aubrey had said,

3116
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:28.630
Aubrey told us that with the reason why those dick pills work is because they're

3117
01:31:28.631 --> 01:31:30.670
filling up with Cialis and Viagra and shit.

3118
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.970
Right.

3119
01:31:30.970 --> 01:31:32.380
It's exactly what it was.

3120
01:31:32.381 --> 01:31:33.810
It was all Cyan Sawyer.

3121
01:31:33.850 --> 01:31:34.181
Okay.

3122
01:31:34.181 --> 01:31:34.451
Okay.

3123
01:31:34.451 --> 01:31:35.020
So it wasn't,

3124
01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:37.540
and it sucks because it's getting harder to find the good ones.

3125
01:31:37.541 --> 01:31:41.110
Now we see a prescription for Cialis cause I don't really need it.

3126
01:31:41.170 --> 01:31:42.040
It's just fun to be,

3127
01:31:42.041 --> 01:31:42.641
you can get it.

3128
01:31:42.641 --> 01:31:43.474
You don't need it.

3129
01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:43.990
Get it.

3130
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.410
Yeah.

3131
01:31:44.410 --> 01:31:45.980
<v 2>You can get one you,</v>

3132
01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:46.361
you say,

3133
01:31:46.361 --> 01:31:47.440
hey my Dick's not working that good.

3134
01:31:47.490 --> 01:31:48.970
There's a lot of unscrupulous doctors.

3135
01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:50.410
They would write you off a prescription.

3136
01:31:50.411 --> 01:31:51.850
Then when you don't have to fuck around with something,

3137
01:31:51.851 --> 01:31:52.810
you don't even know what it is.

3138
01:31:53.050 --> 01:31:54.400
If you take a Viagra,

3139
01:31:54.401 --> 01:31:55.660
you know that's a Viagra.

3140
01:31:56.140 --> 01:31:57.370
So you're going crazy.

3141
01:31:57.371 --> 01:31:58.900
You're playing Russian roulette with your help,

3142
01:31:58.910 --> 01:32:00.320
but seven 11 fucking

3143
01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:02.000
<v 1>stuff that looks like pop rocks.</v>

3144
01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.470
You throw it into your,

3145
01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:04.880
your drink and shaking it up.

3146
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:06.470
This is a real sex enhancer.

3147
01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:07.521
Meanwhile,

3148
01:32:07.521 --> 01:32:11.750
it's like seven times the normal level of Cialis you're supposed to take and

3149
01:32:11.751 --> 01:32:12.830
you're gonna Break Your Dick one day.

3150
01:32:12.831 --> 01:32:15.800
You're gonna get that priapism to drain your Dick with a needle.

3151
01:32:15.850 --> 01:32:18.530
<v 3>It's funny is the the one that's the Cialis one,</v>

3152
01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:19.010
uh,

3153
01:32:19.010 --> 01:32:21.500
the pills have gotten bigger on some of them and it says,

3154
01:32:21.501 --> 01:32:23.540
now it says like last up to seven days.

3155
01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.550
And then on the back it says,

3156
01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:27.290
only take one every 24 hours.

3157
01:32:27.291 --> 01:32:29.750
So I've taken like three of this seven,

3158
01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:31.220
seven day ones.

3159
01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:32.390
Which ones like ours,

3160
01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:33.561
we know every,

3161
01:32:33.561 --> 01:32:34.760
I take it three in a week,

3162
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:38.870
but that's a week's worth of bone or so that's like 49 boners and one boner.

3163
01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.020
<v 1>You should not do that.</v>

3164
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:41.700
You're going to break your Dick,

3165
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:43.230
you Dixon going to work without them.

3166
01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:44.580
That's what's going to happen.

3167
01:32:44.610 --> 01:32:45.110
And you're gonna,

3168
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:47.130
you're gonna also confidence wise,

3169
01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:48.710
you're going to rely on that wonder Dick.

3170
01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:49.081
Well,

3171
01:32:49.081 --> 01:32:49.920
I can tell I go,

3172
01:32:49.921 --> 01:32:52.110
how am I going to fuck a girl with my regular dick?

3173
01:32:52.111 --> 01:32:53.910
My regular deck just doesn't get that hard.

3174
01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:54.780
But when I get,

3175
01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:55.860
when I'm on wonder Dick,

3176
01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:57.960
<v 3>I mean I masturbate every day though.</v>

3177
01:32:57.961 --> 01:32:58.980
So I would know immediately.

3178
01:32:59.030 --> 01:33:00.090
You're on every day.

3179
01:33:00.091 --> 01:33:01.160
You're constantly masturbating.

3180
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.710
No,

3181
01:33:01.710 --> 01:33:04.830
I'm going to take Mexican Bay while you're on Viagara I take breaks.

3182
01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:05.813
<v 1>Oh good.</v>

3183
01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.980
But you cycle on and off.

3184
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:09.880
<v 3>I took one on stage,</v>

3185
01:33:09.930 --> 01:33:10.140
uh,

3186
01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:12.410
in Sacramento because I had one on me.

3187
01:33:12.411 --> 01:33:16.130
It was called gold roller and it's as gold gorilla on the front.

3188
01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:17.013
And uh,

3189
01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:18.440
and I was showing everybody and someone's like,

3190
01:33:18.441 --> 01:33:18.690
hey,

3191
01:33:18.690 --> 01:33:19.110
good.

3192
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.800
I'm like,

3193
01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:20.001
all right,

3194
01:33:20.001 --> 01:33:20.780
I'll take it.

3195
01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:23.900
I open it up and I put it in my mouth and at [inaudible] at excellent breaks in

3196
01:33:23.901 --> 01:33:24.410
my mouth.

3197
01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:25.880
You know how like the capsule,

3198
01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:26.981
it was this boner,

3199
01:33:26.981 --> 01:33:27.140
like,

3200
01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:27.621
cause I couldn't,

3201
01:33:27.621 --> 01:33:29.640
I couldn't talk because it was so much powder.

3202
01:33:29.641 --> 01:33:33.140
It just exploded and it was the most disgusting thing ever.

3203
01:33:33.141 --> 01:33:36.200
But then I had like a crazy boner for like three days,

3204
01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:37.153
three days

3205
01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:43.090
<v 1>that they're still killing rhinos to look to give Chinese dudes boners do they</v>

3206
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:46.520
not know about the boner pills?

3207
01:33:46.521 --> 01:33:47.720
Do they not know about Viagara?

3208
01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:48.770
Is that possible?

3209
01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:50.950
<v 3>What's that Horny goat seed all about?</v>

3210
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:51.833
Like killed

3211
01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:53.450
<v 1>Horny goat weed?</v>

3212
01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:54.981
I don't know.

3213
01:33:54.981 --> 01:33:55.460
I don't even,

3214
01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:56.900
I think that's a mood enhancer.

3215
01:33:56.970 --> 01:33:57.390
Yeah.

3216
01:33:57.390 --> 01:33:57.590
Let me,

3217
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:58.311
let's go with that.

3218
01:33:58.311 --> 01:33:59.180
I'm going to read that.

3219
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.781
Uh,

3220
01:33:59.781 --> 01:34:02.990
I've never taken the horny goat weed in any mass quantities.

3221
01:34:03.050 --> 01:34:05.220
Maybe not taking it on once or twice as a,

3222
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.710
uh,

3223
01:34:05.710 --> 01:34:07.100
an ingredient and something else,

3224
01:34:07.190 --> 01:34:08.023
right?

3225
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.251
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

3226
01:34:08.251 --> 01:34:10.000
They'd been knocking them down a lot lately though.

3227
01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:14.610
There's been at least 10 different companies that have been hit by that a you

3228
01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:17.850
thing where they made them pull the pills because there was Viagara in them.

3229
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:20.790
<v 1>And so what is it trademark infringement or something?</v>

3230
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.331
<v 3>No,</v>

3231
01:34:21.331 --> 01:34:21.511
they're,

3232
01:34:21.511 --> 01:34:24.430
they're selling prescription drugs and mixed with like apples.

3233
01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:25.660
You know,

3234
01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:26.620
Erin's still gotcha.

3235
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:27.031
Yeah.

3236
01:34:27.031 --> 01:34:28.250

<v 1>It's called the epimedium.</v>

3238
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:31.750
Hmm?

3239
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:33.300
Where do you go with what we do is,

3240
01:34:33.330 --> 01:34:34.163

3292
01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.400
Many species,

3293
01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:32.090
the qualities associated with a content of I Caryn.

3294
01:35:32.850 --> 01:35:33.860
According to legend,

3295
01:35:33.861 --> 01:35:35.510
this property was discovered by a Chinese,

3296
01:35:35.511 --> 01:35:40.070
got a goat herder who noticed the sexual activity in his flock scene.

3297
01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.750
Same story as the fucking,

3298
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:42.230
uh,

3299
01:35:42.230 --> 01:35:43.070
the quarter subs.

3300
01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:43.670
Mushrooms.

3301
01:35:43.670 --> 01:35:44.870
It's probably a bullshit story.

3302
01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:48.170
Probably some marketing shit from the 1400 balls with the mushroom man.

3303
01:35:48.171 --> 01:35:49.310
With this horny goat weed.

3304
01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:50.720
I even know the girl,

3305
01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:52.730
that mushroom stuff does fucking work.

3306
01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:53.550
I hadn't mixed.

3307
01:35:53.550 --> 01:35:55.200
<v 2>Does he mind mind when you are telling me earlier?</v>

3308
01:35:55.201 --> 01:35:55.350
Um,

3309
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:56.460
but I and about hey,

3310
01:35:56.461 --> 01:35:57.720
why are you taking those pills?

3311
01:35:57.721 --> 01:35:58.554
You don't know what's in.

3312
01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:02.640
I was picturing your early story about the Zombie ions and I was imagining like

3313
01:36:02.670 --> 01:36:06.090
that mushroom going into the peel that I takes and these dick exploding.

3314
01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:07.610
<v 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3315
01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:08.473
It can be

3316
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.220
a little body dies and his dick becomes like a fireworks display.

3317
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:17.340
A lot of these supplements that you take these buttons poses are actually ants.

3318
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:19.280
Tons of Africans.

3319
01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.210
It's African black ants.

3320
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:22.200
Yeah.

3321
01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:24.930
We've talked about this before in the podcast where the boner pills.

3322
01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:25.410
Yeah,

3323
01:36:25.410 --> 01:36:25.951
a lot of them.

3324
01:36:25.951 --> 01:36:29.280
Cause if you just type in boner pill and you don't have a bunch of stuff where

3325
01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:30.210
we did talk about that,

3326
01:36:30.211 --> 01:36:33.870
but I think we got sidetracked and never came to a rational conclusion.

3327
01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:34.131
Yeah.

3328
01:36:34.131 --> 01:36:35.190
Cause I think it was one of those,

3329
01:36:35.210 --> 01:36:36.420
one of the pills he actually,

3330
01:36:36.421 --> 01:36:38.400
that was pulled by whatever the FDA,

3331
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.880
uh,

3332
01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:42.960
last week was even called something like Boehner answer something like this is,

3333
01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:43.411
<v 1>I'll,</v>

3334
01:36:43.411 --> 01:36:43.671
I'll,

3335
01:36:43.671 --> 01:36:44.600
I'll give you the rundown.

3336
01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:45.271
Scientifically,

3337
01:36:45.271 --> 01:36:46.110
if anybody gives a shit,

3338
01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:51.320
it actually apparently does have a similar effect to nitric oxide.

3339
01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.660
A supplements which also give you boners,

3340
01:36:54.690 --> 01:36:57.540
which is also one of the reasons why Viagra is a performance enhancing

3341
01:36:57.541 --> 01:36:58.374
supplement.

3342
01:36:58.420 --> 01:36:59.070
Um,

3343
01:36:59.070 --> 01:37:00.270
a lot of athletes,

3344
01:37:00.271 --> 01:37:01.800
I think it's banned from the Olympics.

3345
01:37:01.801 --> 01:37:05.100
I think you can't use a viagara anymore because it,

3346
01:37:05.110 --> 01:37:07.530
it gives you a boost,

3347
01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:07.730
uh,

3348
01:37:07.730 --> 01:37:08.730
an athletic boost.

3349
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:10.200
I think it's an endurance boost.

3350
01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:13.830
The same thing it does when it gives your dick this crazy fucking right under

3351
01:37:13.831 --> 01:37:14.400
deck.

3352
01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:16.200
It also does that for the rest of your body.

3353
01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:18.420
It increases blood flow or something.

3354
01:37:18.450 --> 01:37:19.140
They didn't know that.

3355
01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:19.560
Yeah.

3356
01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:19.621
Yeah.

3357
01:37:19.621 --> 01:37:21.840
You're recycling your blood in more parts of your body.

3358
01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.150
Some around what he said,

3359
01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:25.230
<v 3>but with some science,</v>

3360
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:27.000
none of us really know.

3361
01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:28.820
She's putting all

3362
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:31.080
this stuff.

3363
01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:31.650
<v 1>Uh,</v>

3364
01:37:31.650 --> 01:37:32.660
[inaudible],

3365
01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:33.693
uh,

3366
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:37.240
sill den Nafld Sildenafil.

3367
01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.720
That's a by Agra,

3368
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:41.120
that's Viagara sill sold an apple.

3369
01:37:41.121 --> 01:37:41.540
I'm probably,

3370
01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:43.100
I'm probably butchering it but it's s.

3371
01:37:43.101 --> 01:37:44.480
I.

3372
01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:44.480
L.

3373
01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:44.480
D.

3374
01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:44.480
E,

3375
01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:44.481
n.

3376
01:37:44.481 --> 01:37:46.650
A.

3377
01:37:46.650 --> 01:37:46.650
F.

3378
01:37:46.650 --> 01:37:46.650
I.

3379
01:37:46.650 --> 01:37:46.650
L.

3380
01:37:46.650 --> 01:37:46.651
Um,

3381
01:37:46.651 --> 01:37:48.020
and that's what's called that Viagara.

3382
01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:48.890
Um,

3383
01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:50.900
this stuff that it produces called I,

3384
01:37:50.901 --> 01:37:51.320
Karen,

3385
01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:51.621
I,

3386
01:37:51.621 --> 01:37:51.921
c.

3387
01:37:51.921 --> 01:37:52.101
A,

3388
01:37:52.101 --> 01:37:52.460
r.

3389
01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:53.600
I.

3390
01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:53.840
N,

3391
01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:58.840
the active compound epidemia inhibits at epimedium rather inhibits the activity

3392
01:37:59.431 --> 01:38:01.110
of PDE five.

3393
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:04.980
And so what this PDE five shit is a,

3394
01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:08.100
it works the same with Horny goat weed.

3395
01:38:08.130 --> 01:38:11.910
The inhibit in inhibiting it as it does with Viagara.

3396
01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.890
So it probably would work,

3397
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:19.430
but it probably wouldn't work as good because I think that Viagara shit is like

3398
01:38:19.591 --> 01:38:20.424
nuclear.

3399
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:21.930
I think they've got to tell like this is like,

3400
01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:23.493
I think my next

3401
01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:24.320
<v 2>a little harder,</v>

3402
01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:29.320
but you take a Viagra and your dick just fucking gets like body slammed against

3403
01:38:30.801 --> 01:38:31.460
your zippers.

3404
01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:32.770
Like where are we partying?

3405
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:36.680
You Dick is just really rowdy.

3406
01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:37.941
Noxious.

3407
01:38:37.941 --> 01:38:39.110
You can find realistic,

3408
01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:41.210
you can feel your heartbeat on the very bottom of it.

3409
01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:42.110
I love that.

3410
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:43.680
And your heartbeat on the Bun me deck.

3411
01:38:43.730 --> 01:38:43.880
Yeah.

3412
01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:44.411
Like that pain.

3413
01:38:44.411 --> 01:38:45.290
It goes down the bottom.

3414
01:38:45.650 --> 01:38:45.951
Yeah.

3415
01:38:45.951 --> 01:38:47.660
And don't measure your heart rate then.

3416
01:38:48.170 --> 01:38:49.880
Cause that's not your resting heart rate.

3417
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:51.230
You're not resting right there.

3418
01:38:51.670 --> 01:38:54.260
Your Dick is going crazy or ticks turn into a Zombie.

3419
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.311
Yeah.

3420
01:38:55.311 --> 01:38:57.560
Even like old dudes that are like barely alive.

3421
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:58.590
They can take a couple of,

3422
01:38:58.591 --> 01:39:01.190
I aggers stick a finger up their ass.

3423
01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:01.941
Damn it.

3424
01:39:01.941 --> 01:39:03.580
It's so fun going to massage parlors.

3425
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:05.580
Eric can't stop it.

3426
01:39:06.850 --> 01:39:08.150
You do it on purpose.

3427
01:39:08.151 --> 01:39:10.040
You're just pretending you're the super freak.

3428
01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:11.660
I'm just a super freak.

3429
01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:12.441
I don't even know what's up.

3430
01:39:12.441 --> 01:39:13.700
I'm trying not to think about sex,

3431
01:39:13.701 --> 01:39:15.320
but just having you in the room,

3432
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:19.990
I'm starting to think I'm on 7,000 milligrams of some seventh of that funnel.

3433
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:23.240
Sell different of an owl or whatever the fuck this stuff that's called and

3434
01:39:23.241 --> 01:39:25.670
starting to think that in the seventies I would have a raincoat,

3435
01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:26.260
you know?

3436
01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:27.260
Oh you probably would.

3437
01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:28.970
Well if you didn't have a podcast,

3438
01:39:28.971 --> 01:39:29.720
you'd have a raincoat.

3439
01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:30.201
How about that?

3440
01:39:30.201 --> 01:39:33.770
You fuck now I've just turned into this.

3441
01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:37.940
Well the problem is it's more fun than not doing it.

3442
01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:39.553
Why you're liking it.

3443
01:39:39.730 --> 01:39:40.300
I can do it.

3444
01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:40.760
People are like,

3445
01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:43.040
why would he like to have hard ons go to massage parlors?

3446
01:39:43.210 --> 01:39:43.920
<v 1>Jerked off.</v>

3447
01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:44.753
Hmm.

3448
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.660
<v 2>Why?</v>

3449
01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:46.493
Why wouldn't he

3450
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:48.771
jerking off?

3451
01:39:48.771 --> 01:39:49.460
I'm just looking at it.

3452
01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:49.850
That was,

3453
01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:51.560
I added that for comic relief.

3454
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:52.460
Of course.

3455
01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:54.450
I'm just displaying my boner for this poor girl.

3456
01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:59.670
<v 1>Added that in four s to lighten up the moment so it doesn't seem as much like</v>

3457
01:39:59.671 --> 01:40:00.504
sexual assault.

3458
01:40:00.590 --> 01:40:01.423
Right.

3459
01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:05.370
<v 2>This one girl had a tan line from the rope the other day.</v>

3460
01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:06.450
It was a rope.

3461
01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:07.613
What do you mean what?

3462
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:09.623
What rope?

3463
01:40:09.650 --> 01:40:11.130
When she was carried into this country,

3464
01:40:11.131 --> 01:40:13.770
I think in San Francisco,

3465
01:40:13.771 --> 01:40:15.420
those are fresh son of a bear.

3466
01:40:15.421 --> 01:40:16.840
So for us like fuck.

3467
01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:17.800
I was like dear.

3468
01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:22.260
She had a watch and she went tanning and she took off her watch or that's from

3469
01:40:22.261 --> 01:40:23.094
rope.

3470
01:40:25.390 --> 01:40:26.223
<v 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

3471
01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:28.853
Yeah.

3472
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.290
<v 2>All right.</v>

3473
01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:33.080
And we want to talk about it too much of a,

3474
01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:34.460
it's a scary subject.

3475
01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:37.310
Well that website that are always talking about that I feel like I shouldn't

3476
01:40:37.311 --> 01:40:38.144
talk about it.

3477
01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:38.721
Talk about it.

3478
01:40:38.721 --> 01:40:39.361
You shouldn't get that.

3479
01:40:39.361 --> 01:40:41.990
What's always going to get taken away and you're going to get monitored by the

3480
01:40:41.991 --> 01:40:44.870
government because there was a bone of police out there and they don't like

3481
01:40:44.871 --> 01:40:47.360
people getting their boners taking care of any illegal manners.

3482
01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:48.920
That's what's going on.

3483
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:54.220
And that's some of the lamest ways to spend dollars of all time

3484
01:40:54.370 --> 01:40:58.660
<v 1>stopping dudes from getting jerked off at like handy massage parlors.</v>

3485
01:40:59.030 --> 01:41:00.610
You might really sucks that shit.

3486
01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:00.851
Oh,

3487
01:41:00.851 --> 01:41:01.061
sorry.

3488
01:41:01.061 --> 01:41:01.800
Go ahead.

3489
01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:01.930
No,

3490
01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:02.060
no,

3491
01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:02.210
go.

3492
01:41:02.210 --> 01:41:03.730
We have undercover sting operations.

3493
01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:04.301
Well,

3494
01:41:04.301 --> 01:41:06.460
I went in there at 3:00 PM with my boner.

3495
01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:08.880
I took boner pills just to be sure.

3496
01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:10.480
I told her I want a full service.

3497
01:41:10.481 --> 01:41:10.841
She said,

3498
01:41:10.841 --> 01:41:11.290
Howard,

3499
01:41:11.290 --> 01:41:12.580
I tapped her leg twice.

3500
01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:15.100
She grabbed my cock and I threw on the ground.

3501
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:17.880
<v 3>I think there's two things I wouldn't mind getting arrested for.</v>

3502
01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:18.753
Warren is,

3503
01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:19.450
uh,

3504
01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:22.990
having weed on me or selling or smoking weed or prostitution.

3505
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.780
I don't,

3506
01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:24.670
I like both of those.

3507
01:41:24.671 --> 01:41:25.330
Who Cares?

3508
01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:25.700
Like what?

3509
01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:25.840
Oh,

3510
01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:26.470
you like to fuck.

3511
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.771
And you're like,

3512
01:41:26.771 --> 01:41:27.071
wait,

3513
01:41:27.071 --> 01:41:27.904
who cares?

3514
01:41:27.970 --> 01:41:28.151
<v 1>Well,</v>

3515
01:41:28.151 --> 01:41:28.601
officer,

3516
01:41:28.601 --> 01:41:30.760
when I threw her to the ground and make the arrest,

3517
01:41:30.761 --> 01:41:34.870
I came all over her face completely coincidentally.

3518
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:38.650
Oh can I say I'm a red blooded American man?

3519
01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:44.040
The Fed up through institution is still illegal in 49 and the NAF states in new

3520
01:41:44.050 --> 01:41:44.560
assets.

3521
01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.490
I fucking insane.

3522
01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.230
I mean it seems like a mistake.

3523
01:41:47.530 --> 01:41:51.370
It seems like a mistake to tell people that they can fuck people as much as they

3524
01:41:51.371 --> 01:41:52.150
like,

3525
01:41:52.150 --> 01:41:53.890
but they can't get paid for it.

3526
01:41:54.130 --> 01:41:57.370
But you can marry a guy that you don't really love and you can fuck him and then

3527
01:41:57.371 --> 01:41:59.260
you could divorce him and make money off of it.

3528
01:41:59.410 --> 01:42:01.390
And then they'll write songs about you.

3529
01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:02.180
Right.

3530
01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:03.390
That's okay.

3531
01:42:03.650 --> 01:42:04.900
You're allowed to be a gold digger,

3532
01:42:04.901 --> 01:42:05.800
but she can't be a whore.

3533
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:07.540
That is fucking fascinating.

3534
01:42:07.541 --> 01:42:10.090
And you're not even allowed to be a gold digger because women will like look at

3535
01:42:10.091 --> 01:42:10.421
that bench.

3536
01:42:10.421 --> 01:42:11.320
You know she doesn't love him.

3537
01:42:11.321 --> 01:42:12.340
He's fucking oldest shit.

3538
01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:16.120
I think she is 40 years younger than him.

3539
01:42:16.121 --> 01:42:17.350
What the fuck they have in common?

3540
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:21.040
It's prostitution.

3541
01:42:21.041 --> 01:42:21.970
What does it have in common?

3542
01:42:21.971 --> 01:42:22.960
She came from Thailand.

3543
01:42:22.961 --> 01:42:23.860
He's got $1 billion.

3544
01:42:23.890 --> 01:42:24.131
Correct.

3545
01:42:24.131 --> 01:42:24.881
Shut your hall.

3546
01:42:24.881 --> 01:42:26.200
You know exactly what it is.

3547
01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:27.460
Let it happen.

3548
01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:27.731
Yeah,

3549
01:42:27.731 --> 01:42:29.260
I mean adults.

3550
01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:30.250
How's it look?

3551
01:42:30.250 --> 01:42:30.970
How's it affected you?

3552
01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:31.420
Fuck,

3553
01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:32.050
exactly.

3554
01:42:32.050 --> 01:42:34.630
It's domain is like you're not hurting anybody else.

3555
01:42:35.010 --> 01:42:36.190
As long as there's no,

3556
01:42:36.191 --> 01:42:37.150
nobody's forced.

3557
01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:38.650
There's no one that age shit.

3558
01:42:38.651 --> 01:42:39.370
There's none of that.

3559
01:42:39.370 --> 01:42:40.730
There's no incentive at all.

3560
01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:42.250
It's back the fuck off.

3561
01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.150
Let people leave out.

3562
01:42:43.151 --> 01:42:43.840
They want,

3563
01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:44.171
yeah.

3564
01:42:44.171 --> 01:42:45.004
Who Cares?

3565
01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:46.150
And there's,

3566
01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:46.571
you know,

3567
01:42:46.571 --> 01:42:47.404
there's a,

3568
01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:51.520
there's an argument that there's nothing wrong with sex.

3569
01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:54.210
So why should there be anything wrong with paying for a sox?

3570
01:42:54.230 --> 01:42:54.640
Yep.

3571
01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:59.640
And the reason why it seems like such a terrible thing to us now is that it's

3572
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.961
frowned upon.

3573
01:43:01.961 --> 01:43:02.890
It's looked down upon.

3574
01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:04.790
But if you look at what it actually is like,

3575
01:43:04.810 --> 01:43:05.643
it's just sex.

3576
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:06.783
Like it's,

3577
01:43:06.910 --> 01:43:08.890
it's weird to a massage people,

3578
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:09.760
right?

3579
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:12.580
You got to pay someone to massage you.

3580
01:43:12.581 --> 01:43:16.330
So you go to a place where they guarantee everybody wants to fuck.

3581
01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:17.110
Okay,

3582
01:43:17.110 --> 01:43:18.900
guys want to fuck girls want to fuck.

3583
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:19.781
That makes sense to me.

3584
01:43:19.781 --> 01:43:21.760
But nobody wants to give you a fucking massage.

3585
01:43:22.090 --> 01:43:22.923
Okay.

3586
01:43:23.110 --> 01:43:25.870
They may not want to give you a goddamn massage.

3587
01:43:25.871 --> 01:43:26.704
Girls don't want to give them,

3588
01:43:26.710 --> 01:43:27.900
they would do it for a little while to do,

3589
01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:28.391
to feel love.

3590
01:43:28.391 --> 01:43:28.920
You right.

3591
01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:29.140
You know,

3592
01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:30.520
I'll give them such someone I love,

3593
01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:33.670
but the reality is I don't want to do it shits a lot of work,

3594
01:43:34.330 --> 01:43:35.850
but sex is not a lot of work,

3595
01:43:35.890 --> 01:43:39.220
but yet you can pay for the massage and he can't pay for sex.

3596
01:43:39.250 --> 01:43:43.630
That is purely puritan values cause it is essentially the same thing.

3597
01:43:43.770 --> 01:43:48.770
But 90% of us will never get paid to massage someone and 90% of us will never

3598
01:43:49.421 --> 01:43:50.920
get paid to have sex with someone.

3599
01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:52.190
I those numbers

3600
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:53.510
<v 5>I fucking made up.</v>

3601
01:43:54.150 --> 01:43:54.630
I'm,

3602
01:43:54.630 --> 01:43:56.690
I'm doing the math here helped me.

3603
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:57.320
Um,

3604
01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:57.740
but,

3605
01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:00.520
but the reality is they're the same goddamn thing.

3606
01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:02.360
It's the same goddamn thing.

3607
01:44:03.230 --> 01:44:04.010
Absolutely.

3608
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:04.581
I agree.

3609
01:44:04.581 --> 01:44:05.690
It should be your choice,

3610
01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:05.990
right?

3611
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:09.200
If you fucking skeeved out by feet and you go to massage people,

3612
01:44:09.201 --> 01:44:10.370
but you don't mind giving head,

3613
01:44:10.730 --> 01:44:11.563
that's you.

3614
01:44:11.630 --> 01:44:12.460
That's you man.

3615
01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:12.771
So do it.

3616
01:44:12.771 --> 01:44:13.604
But it's okay.

3617
01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:16.160
And to me it's more on us than a,

3618
01:44:16.161 --> 01:44:16.431
you know,

3619
01:44:16.431 --> 01:44:18.350
a lot of people then flashlights,

3620
01:44:18.351 --> 01:44:19.184
how about that?

3621
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:21.110
We've had those for two fucking years.

3622
01:44:21.530 --> 01:44:23.900
It's way more honest to pay a person to do it and you know,

3623
01:44:23.901 --> 01:44:27.170
line and hooking up just really cause you want to fuck somebody.

3624
01:44:27.230 --> 01:44:27.531
Hello.

3625
01:44:27.531 --> 01:44:30.260
Flashlights are very good for that.

3626
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:31.360
That's very,

3627
01:44:31.410 --> 01:44:32.243
oh and by the way,

3628
01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:36.920
people have been emailing me 1700 times saying tell Joe to catch a flashlight.

3629
01:44:36.921 --> 01:44:38.240
He still has so many scars.

3630
01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.580
I'm sure it probably preferably slight.

3631
01:44:40.610 --> 01:44:41.440
You wanted one.

3632
01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:43.130
Will you shut an emailed me before I got here?

3633
01:44:43.131 --> 01:44:44.510
I still haven't seen it in the closet.

3634
01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:45.240
I ate them,

3635
01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:46.320
I fed them to my chickens.

3636
01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:48.353
<v 3>Right.</v>

3637
01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:49.510
<v 5>Number.</v>

3638
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:54.120
The thing is like the stuff you were saying about how people perceive the sexes

3639
01:44:54.121 --> 01:44:55.480
are really not okay in some ways.

3640
01:44:55.481 --> 01:44:56.920
And there's this pubic done vibe.

3641
01:44:57.340 --> 01:44:58.210
Mostly American though,

3642
01:44:58.211 --> 01:44:58.391
right?

3643
01:44:58.391 --> 01:44:58.601
Yeah.

3644
01:44:58.601 --> 01:45:00.210
I mean that's where my weird uh,

3645
01:45:00.250 --> 01:45:01.750
fall beach scene coming.

3646
01:45:01.751 --> 01:45:04.030
Cause when I came to us and that was just trying to ask,

3647
01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:04.430
you know,

3648
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:06.480
are learning new language or picking up new awards.

3649
01:45:06.490 --> 01:45:08.140
And so I heard the word does a lot.

3650
01:45:08.290 --> 01:45:09.070
I'm like slapped.

3651
01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:09.910
What the fuck doesn't mean.

3652
01:45:09.911 --> 01:45:10.450
It's like,

3653
01:45:10.450 --> 01:45:10.691
wow.

3654
01:45:10.691 --> 01:45:14.010
The woman was a kind of screaming until the [inaudible] left that Rye,

3655
01:45:14.011 --> 01:45:14.201
blah,

3656
01:45:14.201 --> 01:45:14.321
blah,

3657
01:45:14.321 --> 01:45:14.890
blah,

3658
01:45:14.890 --> 01:45:15.460
and I was like,

3659
01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:15.700
well,

3660
01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:17.080
if sex is a good thing,

3661
01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:22.480
then as lot somebody will freely give sex away in disagreement as to the left or

3662
01:45:22.481 --> 01:45:22.781
right.

3663
01:45:22.781 --> 01:45:24.760
It's kind of like a humanitarian.

3664
01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:25.010
I'm like,

3665
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:25.570
he's like,

3666
01:45:25.570 --> 01:45:28.750
if philanthropists do some sort of sexual matter theories,

3667
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:29.800
that's a beautiful thing.

3668
01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:30.450
Right?

3669
01:45:30.450 --> 01:45:31.120
He always really,

3670
01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:31.601
really bad.

3671
01:45:31.601 --> 01:45:32.380
I was like,

3672
01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:32.681
wait,

3673
01:45:32.681 --> 01:45:34.240
why don't let me try it again?

3674
01:45:34.241 --> 01:45:34.460
You know?

3675
01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:35.293
It's like that.

3676
01:45:35.410 --> 01:45:36.480
That shit doesn't make sense to,

3677
01:45:36.490 --> 01:45:39.550
wasn't there a woman in Italy that made it to the parliament?

3678
01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:39.910
Oh yeah.

3679
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:40.570
Porn Star.

3680
01:45:40.570 --> 01:45:41.141
She truly not.

3681
01:45:41.141 --> 01:45:41.974
Yes.

3682
01:45:42.010 --> 01:45:43.660
What a great name for a dirty bitch.

3683
01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:45.090
She Shalina.

3684
01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:46.060
That's Eataly for you.

3685
01:45:46.061 --> 01:45:46.894
All right.

3686
01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:47.650
Pardon?

3687
01:45:47.650 --> 01:45:48.850
Stire actually,

3688
01:45:48.851 --> 01:45:51.330
I've been multiple times that she was the first and then a few others.

3689
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:53.590
Then the same thing and they all got elected because he's like,

3690
01:45:53.591 --> 01:45:54.230
he that he's like,

3691
01:45:54.230 --> 01:45:58.150
I'm going to vote for these annoying old guy or diesel noidal guy.

3692
01:45:58.210 --> 01:45:58.421
Hey,

3693
01:45:58.421 --> 01:45:59.350
there's the Barnstar,

3694
01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:02.590
but ain't no seriously

3695
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:03.680
<v 3>the place up north.</v>

3696
01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:04.980
They went with a tan line girl,

3697
01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:05.961
I think it was.

3698
01:46:05.961 --> 01:46:07.970
It was a GI GFE place,

3699
01:46:07.971 --> 01:46:10.880
which is the girlfriend experiment or experience.

3700
01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:11.953
And uh,

3701
01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:15.350
it sucked because when she was talking like she didn't want to massage me at

3702
01:46:15.351 --> 01:46:15.471
all.

3703
01:46:15.471 --> 01:46:17.360
So you just said it was kind of just like crawling on me,

3704
01:46:17.361 --> 01:46:19.040
like tapping me was like bullshit.

3705
01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:20.390
But then at the end of it,

3706
01:46:20.391 --> 01:46:22.340
she just wanted to lay down next to me.

3707
01:46:22.341 --> 01:46:26.090
So we were both like laying down and then she fell asleep and it was so sad.

3708
01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:26.541
Like I'm like,

3709
01:46:26.541 --> 01:46:26.751
all right,

3710
01:46:26.751 --> 01:46:28.130
I'm just going to stay here for a bit.

3711
01:46:28.190 --> 01:46:29.480
I guess she's sleeping.

3712
01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:30.140
I'm like,

3713
01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:30.920
that's going to happen.

3714
01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:32.420
And then like a door slams,

3715
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:35.140
I don't know if like somebody else was coming in or if it was like the mme one,

3716
01:46:35.230 --> 01:46:35.990
what the fuck,

3717
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.261
you know?

3718
01:46:36.261 --> 01:46:36.711
And she'd get like,

3719
01:46:36.711 --> 01:46:37.500
gets up real quick and quick.

3720
01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:37.750
Oh,

3721
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:38.030
oh,

3722
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.481
thank you.

3723
01:46:38.481 --> 01:46:39.440
I'll be right back with tea.

3724
01:46:39.441 --> 01:46:40.010
And I'm like,

3725
01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:40.581
oh my God,

3726
01:46:40.581 --> 01:46:42.360
this poor girl just fell asleep on me.

3727
01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:44.600
<v 5>That's so sad.</v>

3728
01:46:45.670 --> 01:46:47.270
It's the saddest thing in the world.

3729
01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:48.933
Ah,

3730
01:46:49.530 --> 01:46:50.040
she probably

3731
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.810
<v 2>blacked out from shame</v>

3732
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:55.200
from trying to deal with this.

3733
01:46:55.201 --> 01:46:56.300
Viagara induce the,

3734
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:58.800
the range is three and a half hours.

3735
01:46:58.970 --> 01:47:03.120
It's probably just shock when you corner a little mouse,

3736
01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:07.260
scream at it freezes horny goat weed.

3737
01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:08.560
That painting Horny goat weed.

3738
01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:09.091
Fainting.

3739
01:47:09.091 --> 01:47:09.924
Horny goat

3740
01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:12.781
is a,

3741
01:47:12.781 --> 01:47:13.321
it's a weird,

3742
01:47:13.321 --> 01:47:14.640
weird aspect that we have.

3743
01:47:14.641 --> 01:47:16.770
This thing were weirded out about sex,

3744
01:47:16.771 --> 01:47:18.120
but that's how this country got started,

3745
01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:19.950
was started by puritans.

3746
01:47:19.951 --> 01:47:20.820
People forget that.

3747
01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:22.220
Did the echoes of the,

3748
01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:24.450
the retards that fucking founded this place,

3749
01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:25.260
there's still,

3750
01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:26.010
they're still here.

3751
01:47:26.010 --> 01:47:27.330
They were religious fanatics.

3752
01:47:27.870 --> 01:47:29.130
The pewter turns left.

3753
01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:30.530
You hear about this stuff about the Punic.

3754
01:47:30.531 --> 01:47:32.280
Don's coming here for religious freedom.

3755
01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:33.300
It's total bullshit.

3756
01:47:33.301 --> 01:47:34.510
They didn't come here for religious freedom.

3757
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:37.590
He means they came here for the footy not to be persecuted.

3758
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:39.120
It's a whole different game.

3759
01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:41.160
Doesn't mean we don't want to persecute somebody else.

3760
01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:42.660
We just don't want to be persecuted.

3761
01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:45.450
Not religious freedom means I don't work their own freedom.

3762
01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:47.550
It's like I don't like to be in that place.

3763
01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:49.020
I don't like my place in the game.

3764
01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:50.670
I have nothing against the game itself.

3765
01:47:50.671 --> 01:47:55.671
As long as I got to be on top and the start fucking native Americas piling them

3766
01:47:58.831 --> 01:48:01.740
up and stacking them and wack and does it right.

3767
01:48:01.741 --> 01:48:03.300
The guys who couldn't see there,

3768
01:48:03.570 --> 01:48:06.720
the church and needing gland as crazy liberals,

3769
01:48:06.721 --> 01:48:11.070
you know they are the hardcore fundamentalist of their data match like

3770
01:48:11.071 --> 01:48:12.030
fundamental is today.

3771
01:48:12.031 --> 01:48:14.970
Back then there was no Hollywood so they were pissed about the theater of

3772
01:48:14.971 --> 01:48:15.804
London.

3773
01:48:15.810 --> 01:48:19.770
They're like there's all the sacs and spectacle and decent that exactly the same

3774
01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:23.700
arguments that you hear today about a fundamental is to gain entertainment

3775
01:48:23.701 --> 01:48:24.534
industry.

3776
01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:28.620
Exactly the same thing cause into 1569 [inaudible] are we in the puritans?

3777
01:48:28.650 --> 01:48:29.490
It's amazing.

3778
01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:30.571
So what happened?

3779
01:48:30.571 --> 01:48:34.560
They came over first or they were one of the first to come over here.

3780
01:48:34.561 --> 01:48:34.771
Yeah,

3781
01:48:34.771 --> 01:48:38.970
no they were well no you're right cause it's the first day I designed their set

3782
01:48:38.971 --> 01:48:40.440
of events in Jamestown,

3783
01:48:40.441 --> 01:48:42.590
in Virginia and dined like 13 years later.

3784
01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:44.450
Not that long later they had a wine,

3785
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:45.870
Plymouth rock and a famous one,

3786
01:48:45.871 --> 01:48:47.500
which is the Qa Donaldson don't off dot.

3787
01:48:47.501 --> 01:48:50.700
Then these are guys that England was more than happy to get rid off cause it's

3788
01:48:50.701 --> 01:48:51.570
like they are,

3789
01:48:51.571 --> 01:48:51.901
we are,

3790
01:48:51.901 --> 01:48:52.501
they are crazy.

3791
01:48:52.501 --> 01:48:54.270
They are knowing they are too much.

3792
01:48:54.271 --> 01:48:55.260
So please go.

3793
01:48:55.261 --> 01:48:56.440
Yeah go site to the new world.

3794
01:48:56.450 --> 01:48:57.283
That's a great idea.

3795
01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:01.230
These guys were ready to leave because they felt that they could start their own

3796
01:49:01.231 --> 01:49:03.450
society where pewter done value is with the rules.

3797
01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:03.900
Right.

3798
01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:07.800
And having to deal with more mellow vision stuff could astounding how much

3799
01:49:07.801 --> 01:49:12.801
different would America have turned out if people landed on the west coast

3800
01:49:12.931 --> 01:49:14.620
instead of the east coast throwback.

3801
01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:17.520
How much different would America have turned out of England was on the other

3802
01:49:17.521 --> 01:49:21.240
side of the world and then they came over and landed in La and we're like oh

3803
01:49:21.241 --> 01:49:22.074
shit.

3804
01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:23.820
Oh Shit bitches.

3805
01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:25.080
We ain't never going back.

3806
01:49:25.230 --> 01:49:26.160
There's no winter.

3807
01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:26.750
Right.

3808
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:27.680
It doesn't happen.

3809
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:32.910
Like they landed in fucking Massachusetts man that is with no heat.

3810
01:49:33.570 --> 01:49:34.020
Yup.

3811
01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:35.130
Oh my God.

3812
01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:37.140
No he no cars.

3813
01:49:37.141 --> 01:49:39.480
You have a few animals to oh Jesus,

3814
01:49:39.690 --> 01:49:42.270
you going to try to collect food and the four months that everything's not

3815
01:49:42.271 --> 01:49:43.530
frozen right now.

3816
01:49:43.531 --> 01:49:46.320
And it's funny cause when they first came they usually would,

3817
01:49:46.330 --> 01:49:48.130
the didn't really how to make a living here.

3818
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:51.370
<v 5>So they would fuck things up and within a year or two they would start treating</v>

3819
01:49:51.371 --> 01:49:52.660
each other in this cheese.

3820
01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:57.070
You buy these stories and it's like some weird a sick shit though.

3821
01:49:59.130 --> 01:50:00.520
It was pure survival.

3822
01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:00.910
Yup.

3823
01:50:00.910 --> 01:50:01.150
Yup.

3824
01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:02.920
No that happened in England too,

3825
01:50:02.921 --> 01:50:03.101
right?

3826
01:50:03.101 --> 01:50:03.491
Wasn't there.

3827
01:50:03.491 --> 01:50:03.751
They,

3828
01:50:03.751 --> 01:50:03.981
they,

3829
01:50:03.981 --> 01:50:07.610
they reconstructed a girl that they had a eaten and uh,

3830
01:50:07.930 --> 01:50:09.720
she was a 14 years old.

3831
01:50:09.721 --> 01:50:10.350
That was,

3832
01:50:10.350 --> 01:50:10.880
that was in,

3833
01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:11.810
that was in style.

3834
01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:12.820
That was Betty first.

3835
01:50:12.821 --> 01:50:16.780
I made a cut in the first versus a buddy teacher called on the customer to stay

3836
01:50:17.230 --> 01:50:18.310
and she was 14.

3837
01:50:18.490 --> 01:50:18.701
Yeah.

3838
01:50:18.701 --> 01:50:19.720
Cause you know they need stuff.

3839
01:50:19.721 --> 01:50:22.270
They Indian so they are not going to have much help from them.

3840
01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:25.960
They don't know how to make a living throughout the year in a new harsh

3841
01:50:25.961 --> 01:50:26.680
environments.

3842
01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:29.380
So soon enough you start eating your friends.

3843
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:30.570
That's always a good idea.

3844
01:50:30.571 --> 01:50:33.430
It's fucking amazing that we've made it this far.

3845
01:50:33.490 --> 01:50:34.140
Yup.

3846
01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:37.870
See it as a person who knows as much as history,

3847
01:50:37.871 --> 01:50:41.380
but as a person who knows as much about history is you do does it,

3848
01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:45.850
it must be like really shocking when you know that this shit was just a couple

3849
01:50:45.850 --> 01:50:46.683
of years away.

3850
01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:47.650
You know,

3851
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:48.610
that's the,

3852
01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:50.290
that to me is what's mind blowing.

3853
01:50:50.530 --> 01:50:55.120
The stuff that has be inclusive or normal throughout much of human history.

3854
01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:00.920
It blows your mind to think like probably 75% of people work totally cool with

3855
01:51:01.650 --> 01:51:05.440
with these ideas that today they would lamb the straightening like a psychiatric

3856
01:51:05.441 --> 01:51:09.940
hospital back then totally normal and again he buzzed down to the same thing.

3857
01:51:09.941 --> 01:51:13.450
These people too lazy to question what they are told and just going with the

3858
01:51:13.451 --> 01:51:16.030
program and just not really a,

3859
01:51:16.031 --> 01:51:19.240
why am I burning people at the stake because they believe in different idea.

3860
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:22.040
It's what my grandpa did and she's cool so I must,

3861
01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:22.230
you know,

3862
01:51:22.230 --> 01:51:25.880
it's like not really stopping to think is these are already highly things.

3863
01:51:25.890 --> 01:51:26.723
These are good idea.

3864
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:27.760
These out how I want to leave.

3865
01:51:27.810 --> 01:51:28.630
Okay.

3866
01:51:28.630 --> 01:51:31.180
How did people find out about the pilgrims,

3867
01:51:31.210 --> 01:51:34.240
whether or not they were doing good enough that people decided let's join these

3868
01:51:34.241 --> 01:51:35.080
crazy bitches.

3869
01:51:35.290 --> 01:51:36.190
How did all that happen?

3870
01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:39.340
Go back and forth and then we're telling how great it was,

3871
01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:40.980
sweet and each other.

3872
01:51:40.981 --> 01:51:41.940
That's fucking awesome.

3873
01:51:41.941 --> 01:51:45.850
There are now some people don't support money as an investment in days.

3874
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:48.430
A lot of of these weren't just the random individuals coming in.

3875
01:51:48.431 --> 01:51:51.680
They were sponsored by corporations is an idea and the reasoning and fast men.

3876
01:51:51.681 --> 01:51:56.110
So these guys had the economic interested in keeping the thing going and there

3877
01:51:56.111 --> 01:51:58.270
are plenty of people who had a shitty life in England.

3878
01:51:58.510 --> 01:52:03.510
So even going into the crazy wild place across the word was back there and and

3879
01:52:03.761 --> 01:52:08.260
what they knew back in England and so they were willing to take chances.

3880
01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:11.590
I mean one of the things that people don't know a lot of the time or don't

3881
01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:16.030
emphasize enough is the idea that a huge chunk of people who came here were

3882
01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:17.530
basically slaves.

3883
01:52:17.590 --> 01:52:20.260
White people probably know him but he just didn't where indenture servants,

3884
01:52:20.261 --> 01:52:22.960
which technically meant you only serve for seven years,

3885
01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:27.310
but most of them are work so hard by their owners that they killed them before

3886
01:52:27.311 --> 01:52:28.300
the 70 [inaudible] were up.

3887
01:52:28.810 --> 01:52:31.180
So really if you were an indenture servants,

3888
01:52:31.181 --> 01:52:34.180
they are pretty much fucked because you are going to be in conditions that are

3889
01:52:34.181 --> 01:52:35.230
semis Lavery.

3890
01:52:35.710 --> 01:52:36.280
Um,

3891
01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:39.640
they are not going to survive to leave see the day when you are fried.

3892
01:52:39.790 --> 01:52:42.100
So it doesn't really matter whether it's in tod,

3893
01:52:42.130 --> 01:52:44.620
it only lasts so long cause you are never going to leave at that time.

3894
01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:48.140
So a lot of these guys would run off the second they arrive here.

3895
01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:51.470
They would try to show their best face when they show up at an Indian and

3896
01:52:51.471 --> 01:52:52.281
compliment saying,

3897
01:52:52.281 --> 01:52:52.730
hey man,

3898
01:52:52.730 --> 01:52:53.563
I mean nice guy.

3899
01:52:53.630 --> 01:52:54.460
Those guys are footie.

3900
01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:55.700
Can you please take me in?

3901
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:57.710
And a bunch of tribes who take them in.

3902
01:52:58.130 --> 01:53:01.190
And so you would have these communities where some time you would have a lot of

3903
01:53:01.191 --> 01:53:01.941
British people.

3904
01:53:01.941 --> 01:53:05.930
We escape the settlement to go leave with Indians because otherwise they would

3905
01:53:05.931 --> 01:53:09.360
get work to that back into settlements and a,

3906
01:53:09.390 --> 01:53:10.270
it's a three story.

3907
01:53:10.271 --> 01:53:13.880
I know the colonies would pass these laws preventing anybody from leaving the

3908
01:53:13.881 --> 01:53:16.970
settlements and going to live with the Indians because otherwise your labor

3909
01:53:16.971 --> 01:53:20.060
force just left and now you have to work on your own.

3910
01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:23.030
How many white dudes went dancing with wolves style?

3911
01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:23.840
Quite a bit.

3912
01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:24.673
There's a,

3913
01:53:24.770 --> 01:53:25.690
there's a really cool story.

3914
01:53:25.691 --> 01:53:26.030
I remember,

3915
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:27.320
I forget the guy's name right now,

3916
01:53:27.321 --> 01:53:30.620
but there was a back at the very beginning of the puritan days,

3917
01:53:30.621 --> 01:53:34.410
there was this one community of sort of crazy unconventional.

3918
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:38.840
The guys that left the main puritan towns and started their own thing.

3919
01:53:38.890 --> 01:53:40.790
We eat a bunch of local Indians.

3920
01:53:40.791 --> 01:53:41.570
They would have,

3921
01:53:41.570 --> 01:53:45.560
they basically at the interracial community where they would buy her tail out.

3922
01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:46.940
They would bring cover their dances,

3923
01:53:46.941 --> 01:53:48.680
some of like sort of hippy heaven.

3924
01:53:49.130 --> 01:53:52.850
Except that because he was a little too hippy half and these guys didn't make

3925
01:53:52.851 --> 01:53:56.960
plans for the purest I wanting to kick their ass because they are community was

3926
01:53:56.961 --> 01:53:59.180
actually growing at a faster rate than the puritans.

3927
01:53:59.210 --> 01:54:00.830
More people wanted to live there,

3928
01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:04.370
but the puritan and military muscle and so they went to kick their ass and

3929
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:05.190
squash them.

3930
01:54:05.190 --> 01:54:08.210
Does motherfucking puritans and that's us.

3931
01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:08.750
Yeah.

3932
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:11.000
If those hippies had planned,

3933
01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:11.590
yeah,

3934
01:54:11.590 --> 01:54:11.931
fuck.

3935
01:54:11.931 --> 01:54:13.190
I mean I'm all for having fun,

3936
01:54:13.191 --> 01:54:17.420
but put two hours a day into planning that maybe you want to know what to do

3937
01:54:17.421 --> 01:54:20.960
when people start shooting at you crazy religious fucks it up dressed up like

3938
01:54:20.961 --> 01:54:22.760
Johnny Cash and they live right down the road.

3939
01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:24.410
Exactly what Kaiser Kooks.

3940
01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:25.281
They're cooks.

3941
01:54:25.281 --> 01:54:26.070
They're all just the same.

3942
01:54:26.070 --> 01:54:26.301
Okay,

3943
01:54:26.301 --> 01:54:26.781
listen,

3944
01:54:26.781 --> 01:54:27.500
we know their kooks.

3945
01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:28.333
Yup.

3946
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:28.850
But listen,

3947
01:54:28.850 --> 01:54:31.760
they spend a lot of time praying that we need to spend that exact amount of time

3948
01:54:31.761 --> 01:54:32.594
making arrows.

3949
01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:33.920
That's the idea.

3950
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:37.310
And instead of half piece stupid,

3951
01:54:37.311 --> 01:54:42.180
he'd be who don't make plans or crazy or religious fundamentalist two are well

3952
01:54:42.181 --> 01:54:43.820
armed and know how to use their guns.

3953
01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:44.570
It's like,

3954
01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:45.403
well,

3955
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:47.480
not exactly the greatest alternatives,

3956
01:54:47.481 --> 01:54:49.610
but I mean why is it nicer than the other?

3957
01:54:49.611 --> 01:54:51.080
But it doesn't make any,

3958
01:54:51.130 --> 01:54:51.410
you know,

3959
01:54:51.410 --> 01:54:53.420
they can leave it in reality because they don't make blinds,

3960
01:54:53.421 --> 01:54:55.640
they don't set some stuff for when shit goes wrong.

3961
01:54:56.090 --> 01:55:00.050
And so the other guys who are way worse ween because they are more disciplined,

3962
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:01.150
those motherfuckers,

3963
01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:03.800
so they absorbed them is the same over them.

3964
01:55:03.801 --> 01:55:05.900
They send them back,

3965
01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:06.260
you know,

3966
01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:07.450
some of them were killed,

3967
01:55:07.451 --> 01:55:07.610
the,

3968
01:55:07.610 --> 01:55:10.520
some of them are reabsorbed under close watch,

3969
01:55:10.521 --> 01:55:10.970
some of it,

3970
01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:11.340
you know,

3971
01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:12.710
bunch of options there.

3972
01:55:12.711 --> 01:55:16.040
But one of the weirdest things about history from me as I get older is realizing

3973
01:55:16.041 --> 01:55:18.820
how short a period of time that was a go where things were.

3974
01:55:18.821 --> 01:55:20.000
So bananas don't,

3975
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:25.030
1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue 1492 yup.

3976
01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:26.031
That's hard to believe.

3977
01:55:26.031 --> 01:55:27.380
There was no buildings here.

3978
01:55:27.650 --> 01:55:28.710
Just that logo.

3979
01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:32.420
Especially when you look at England and the shit that's up in London meeting,

3980
01:55:32.421 --> 01:55:36.330
you can go visit things in London or a thousand years old America itself.

3981
01:55:36.331 --> 01:55:37.164
So only 200 fucking,

3982
01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:39.273
I know

3983
01:55:40.370 --> 01:55:41.060
someone,

3984
01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:42.920
he landed in The Bahamas,

3985
01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:43.980
you

3986
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:44.311
<v 1>know,</v>

3987
01:55:44.311 --> 01:55:45.690
a little over 400 years ago.

3988
01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:46.320
Right.

3989
01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:47.131
That's crazy.

3990
01:55:47.131 --> 01:55:47.910
It is.

3991
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:48.570
It is.

3992
01:55:48.570 --> 01:55:49.321
And in that sense,

3993
01:55:49.321 --> 01:55:49.431
yeah.

3994
01:55:49.431 --> 01:55:50.400
I leave living in Europe,

3995
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:54.090
<v 5>he's at 30 public was you go down the street to meet your friend and you Harvard</v>

3996
01:55:54.110 --> 01:55:56.100
next to a building that's like 2000

3997
01:55:57.470 --> 01:55:58.450
<v 1>fuck fuck.</v>

3998
01:55:58.690 --> 01:55:59.150
It's crazy.

3999
01:55:59.150 --> 01:56:03.130
Really nuts to think that those people just live in that one spot forever.

4000
01:56:03.250 --> 01:56:04.000
Yup.

4001
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:04.271
You know,

4002
01:56:04.271 --> 01:56:06.100
that's one of the really cool things.

4003
01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:08.410
This Dan Carlin thing on um,

4004
01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:10.270
on the history of the Mongols.

4005
01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:14.840
Oh it was realizing how much these guys affected Asia and,

4006
01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:15.130
and,

4007
01:56:15.130 --> 01:56:18.700
and how much they would have affective Europe and they affected Russia.

4008
01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:19.270
Yup.

4009
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:19.451
Yeah.

4010
01:56:19.451 --> 01:56:24.451
Like Europe got really lucky there Susan or depending on point of view cause

4011
01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:25.540
yeah,

4012
01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:28.030
what they add wasn't exactly what they had was horrible.

4013
01:56:28.290 --> 01:56:28.830
The,

4014
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:29.190
they,

4015
01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:31.450
they dodged a crazy bullet with,

4016
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:33.160
with those motherfuckers did.

4017
01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:35.680
And then what the,

4018
01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:38.860
one of the craziest things that Dan Carlin was talking about was when they took

4019
01:56:38.861 --> 01:56:40.450
over Baghdad and killed everybody,

4020
01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:43.330
that it literally hasn't ever recovered.

4021
01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:43.691
No.

4022
01:56:43.691 --> 01:56:45.860
They say he was like see

4023
01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:49.400
<v 5>send 30 years before the population was at the same level as before.</v>

4024
01:56:49.401 --> 01:56:50.111
They wiped out.

4025
01:56:50.111 --> 01:56:50.760
I mean the Mongols,

4026
01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:51.680
he didn't fuck around.

4027
01:56:51.681 --> 01:56:51.950
Yeah.

4028
01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:55.190
They really were genocide one oh one you know,

4029
01:56:55.191 --> 01:56:56.080
as they,

4030
01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:57.351
<v 1>yeah.</v>

4031
01:56:57.351 --> 01:57:00.350
Those guys and deeply progress,

4032
01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:01.700
they ruined cultures.

4033
01:57:01.701 --> 01:57:03.140
They rule everything they learned.

4034
01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:04.040
Yep.

4035
01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:04.430
See Ya.

4036
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:05.263
Light it on fire.

4037
01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:06.440
They didn't want to take it with them.

4038
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:07.290
Nope.

4039
01:57:07.290 --> 01:57:07.761
It's a,

4040
01:57:07.761 --> 01:57:11.860
if it's not useful in a [inaudible] or running around with my horses down the

4041
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:12.051
fuck,

4042
01:57:12.051 --> 01:57:12.530
do I care?

4043
01:57:12.530 --> 01:57:14.690
That's the nuttiest thing is that they never really,

4044
01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:15.300
they caught,

4045
01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:16.280
captured all these cities,

4046
01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:17.150
but they,

4047
01:57:17.150 --> 01:57:18.300
they live were no mats.

4048
01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:18.650
Yeah.

4049
01:57:18.650 --> 01:57:19.760
They didn't have a country.

4050
01:57:21.870 --> 01:57:24.980
Huge mass of people making their way across the world.

4051
01:57:24.981 --> 01:57:25.820
Killing everybody.

4052
01:57:25.850 --> 01:57:26.683
Yep.

4053
01:57:27.090 --> 01:57:28.890
<v 5>My favorite on that one is when the,</v>

4054
01:57:28.891 --> 01:57:29.370
um,

4055
01:57:29.370 --> 01:57:30.500
when they do enter bag,

4056
01:57:30.501 --> 01:57:31.350
that and the whole story,

4057
01:57:31.650 --> 01:57:33.420
there was the thing of this one guy,

4058
01:57:33.421 --> 01:57:35.540
he was a locale governor or Keel,

4059
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:37.170
the Mongol traders early on.

4060
01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:38.510
So the Mongols were piece,

4061
01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:41.580
they sent an ambassador or this guy chopped off the head of the ambassadors to

4062
01:57:41.581 --> 01:57:42.570
saying they are spies.

4063
01:57:43.230 --> 01:57:46.760
He banked on the fact that it was a big desert separating you from the bone goes

4064
01:57:46.761 --> 01:57:48.180
so they wouldn't be able to invade.

4065
01:57:48.630 --> 01:57:50.520
He didn't make his calculations right.

4066
01:57:50.521 --> 01:57:52.140
Cause the Mongols go out through the desert.

4067
01:57:52.141 --> 01:57:55.770
They show up at his door and after mass wiping out with everyone else,

4068
01:57:56.190 --> 01:57:57.570
they grab this guy and said,

4069
01:57:57.571 --> 01:58:00.120
you are a greedy motherfuckers because of that.

4070
01:58:00.121 --> 01:58:00.954
You want gold,

4071
01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:02.730
we'll give you all the gold you want.

4072
01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:07.380
They mailed a bunch of gold and pour molten gold down his throat to kill him.

4073
01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:11.620
<v 1>Does guys into his eyes and his ears as well.</v>

4074
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:16.460
Those guys are not playing around and then they probably chopped its head open

4075
01:58:16.461 --> 01:58:17.330
and get that gold back.

4076
01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:17.791
Exactly.

4077
01:58:17.791 --> 01:58:18.051
It's like,

4078
01:58:18.051 --> 01:58:18.501
okay now,

4079
01:58:18.501 --> 01:58:18.860
sorry.

4080
01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:18.981
No,

4081
01:58:18.981 --> 01:58:19.760
we need to be back.

4082
01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:20.740
If you don't mind that.

4083
01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:23.240
It's just amazing that that again,

4084
01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:28.330
1200 B a d 1200 that's not that long ago.

4085
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:30.680
This none of this is that long ago.

4086
01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:33.170
And that was the a couple of hundred years before Martin Luther,

4087
01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:33.741
you know,

4088
01:58:33.741 --> 01:58:38.590
and that's just a few hundred years before people came to America and that's a

4089
01:58:38.590 --> 01:58:39.261
few hundred years for slavery.

4090
01:58:39.261 --> 01:58:41.000
Was abolished and it's all,

4091
01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:42.070
it is so recent.

4092
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:43.240
<v 5>It's really weird.</v>

4093
01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:43.921
So I mean,

4094
01:58:43.921 --> 01:58:44.061
right?

4095
01:58:44.061 --> 01:58:44.170
Yeah.

4096
01:58:44.170 --> 01:58:49.170
Deer in California where we stand back in the 1850s more than half of the

4097
01:58:51.721 --> 01:58:53.010
American Indian populations,

4098
01:58:53.011 --> 01:58:56.340
I feel like 80% what was wiped out would not be cause of diseases and not

4099
01:58:56.341 --> 01:58:57.031
because of stuff,

4100
01:58:57.031 --> 01:58:59.100
but what they adding then a lot of California towns,

4101
01:58:59.101 --> 01:59:00.330
whoever they Indian hands,

4102
01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:03.320
which was the law cowl on the lockout newspaper,

4103
01:59:03.330 --> 01:59:04.950
they would publish the scene that if you,

4104
01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:05.970
you know,

4105
01:59:05.970 --> 01:59:06.631
you're broke,

4106
01:59:06.631 --> 01:59:07.321
you have no money,

4107
01:59:07.321 --> 01:59:09.150
go kill some Indian scalp them.

4108
01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.860
And if you come back into town,

4109
01:59:10.861 --> 01:59:14.730
the local government will pay you a certain amount for the scalp of an adult.

4110
01:59:14.731 --> 01:59:15.570
Male Alito,

4111
01:59:15.610 --> 01:59:18.780
they last for the scalpel for an adult female and a little bit less for the

4112
01:59:18.781 --> 01:59:22.740
scalp of a child because it's good for the health of the community to wipe out

4113
01:59:22.741 --> 01:59:23.574
Indians.

4114
01:59:23.970 --> 01:59:27.090
1850s not immediately on years ago.

4115
01:59:27.090 --> 01:59:27.450
Right.

4116
01:59:27.450 --> 01:59:28.050
You know,

4117
01:59:28.050 --> 01:59:28.980
under our feet.

4118
01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:30.773
That's a three.

4119
01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:32.190
Wow.

4120
01:59:32.370 --> 01:59:33.203
Yup.

4121
01:59:33.310 --> 01:59:33.691
You know,

4122
01:59:33.691 --> 01:59:36.120
I always wondered what that whole scalping thing,

4123
01:59:36.121 --> 01:59:37.050
where that came from.

4124
01:59:37.230 --> 01:59:39.240
I thought it was the Indians did the scalping,

4125
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.900
you know,

4126
01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:41.550
actually they do stuff like that in it,

4127
01:59:41.551 --> 01:59:44.790
but they did it sit on the ward because they ain't got died of some to just

4128
01:59:44.791 --> 01:59:47.130
carry around people's heads to prove that you kill them.

4129
01:59:47.290 --> 01:59:48.330
So it's like,

4130
01:59:48.331 --> 01:59:50.520
do I really have to carry these big fucking thing?

4131
01:59:50.521 --> 01:59:53.340
Could imagine like chopping off the head of somebody like Tito Ortiz.

4132
01:59:53.370 --> 01:59:54.330
Big giant head.

4133
01:59:54.331 --> 01:59:57.180
It's like I have to carry around to put up with at Ikea they can,

4134
01:59:57.181 --> 01:59:59.280
I just scalping be diluted.

4135
02:00:00.230 --> 02:00:05.230
So [inaudible] a bunch of places so then you know you could scalp to butt cheeks

4136
02:00:05.821 --> 02:00:06.151
and say,

4137
02:00:06.151 --> 02:00:06.471
ah,

4138
02:00:06.471 --> 02:00:07.840
I killed a couple of Baldrige too.

4139
02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:11.820
I mean you get three for the price of one if you were unscrupulous.

4140
02:00:11.821 --> 02:00:12.654
Yeah.

4141
02:00:13.730 --> 02:00:15.880
This motherfuckers scalping balled in yet.

4142
02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:18.360
That's one of the beautiful things about the native Americans.

4143
02:00:18.361 --> 02:00:19.590
They actually go bald.

4144
02:00:19.591 --> 02:00:20.100
Right?

4145
02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:24.780
There wasn't a one of their genetics that genetic pastor sort of only got

4146
02:00:24.781 --> 02:00:26.820
introduced to them after we came around.

4147
02:00:26.910 --> 02:00:29.010
I tell you these Indians shirt smell though.

4148
02:00:30.490 --> 02:00:31.323
<v 3>That's about it.</v>

4149
02:00:31.470 --> 02:00:31.840
<v 5>Nevermind.</v>

4150
02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:33.660
No Butt.

4151
02:00:33.661 --> 02:00:34.830
Cheeks don't smell that bad.

4152
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.830
Back then.

4153
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:37.290
This was back then,

4154
02:00:37.291 --> 02:00:38.101
the whole package,

4155
02:00:38.101 --> 02:00:38.251
right.

4156
02:00:38.251 --> 02:00:40.960
Everything below the pallet was just a mess up the east coast.

4157
02:00:41.090 --> 02:00:43.080
They probably never really painted their face.

4158
02:00:43.081 --> 02:00:44.010
It was just from butts

4159
02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:48.880
in a sense on how they use it to go.

4160
02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:49.621
It's there bad.

4161
02:00:49.621 --> 02:00:51.800
I seen that they will do where a lot of uh,

4162
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.681
Indian tribes,

4163
02:00:52.681 --> 02:00:52.971
they are,

4164
02:00:52.971 --> 02:00:55.500
they would shave every other part of their head,

4165
02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:58.940
but they would leave these really long strand of fair in the middle.

4166
02:00:58.970 --> 02:01:00.870
That was like the Scallop,

4167
02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:04.760
not that you leave it out there for others as a challenge to other warriors of

4168
02:01:04.761 --> 02:01:05.030
saying,

4169
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.300
Hey,

4170
02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:06.260
it is my scalp.

4171
02:01:06.350 --> 02:01:07.580
You want to take it to come and take it.

4172
02:01:07.581 --> 02:01:10.340
It makes it even easier for you to grasp it and pull it out.

4173
02:01:10.490 --> 02:01:10.851
Yeah,

4174
02:01:10.851 --> 02:01:11.830
so he was a,

4175
02:01:11.850 --> 02:01:12.141
he's one.

4176
02:01:12.141 --> 02:01:13.220
That's what you kind of thing.

4177
02:01:13.221 --> 02:01:13.820
He's like,

4178
02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:14.870
I'll leave it on you.

4179
02:01:14.871 --> 02:01:15.890
Leave your son.

4180
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:17.990
Let's see what gets to take home was first.

4181
02:01:17.991 --> 02:01:18.830
That's ridiculous.

4182
02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:20.690
That's just begging for the gun to be invented.

4183
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:24.500
Silly pitches out there shooting pointed rocks at each other.

4184
02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:26.510
The fuck are you doing man,

4185
02:01:26.511 --> 02:01:27.440
grabbing each other's hair,

4186
02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:28.640
cutting each other's heads off.

4187
02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:32.430
<v 3>See that guy that on that video the other day that was like walking across I</v>

4188
02:01:32.431 --> 02:01:37.431
think like two like a waterfall or something and he was doing like the balancing

4189
02:01:37.591 --> 02:01:42.591
thing and he fell and he held on and then he was like trying to climb across it

4190
02:01:44.151 --> 02:01:46.070
and he had a long ponytail in his pony tail.

4191
02:01:46.071 --> 02:01:50.440
Got Stuck in it and he let go and he scalped himself dies

4192
02:01:50.770 --> 02:01:52.600
<v 2>is a son who died from that.</v>

4193
02:01:52.601 --> 02:01:52.940
Yeah.

4194
02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:53.451
<v 3>Cause he,</v>

4195
02:01:53.451 --> 02:01:54.284
cause he fell.

4196
02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:55.153
Oh my God,

4197
02:01:55.220 --> 02:01:56.930
his ponytail stayed on the line.

4198
02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:57.893
<v 2>Uh,</v>

4199
02:01:59.250 --> 02:02:00.210
that's when you know,

4200
02:02:00.630 --> 02:02:01.410
that can be good.

4201
02:02:01.410 --> 02:02:02.430
That's a shit choice.

4202
02:02:02.431 --> 02:02:05.280
And hair were either death or God hates you.

4203
02:02:05.550 --> 02:02:05.911
Yeah.

4204
02:02:05.911 --> 02:02:06.960
You fucked up son.

4205
02:02:06.990 --> 02:02:07.980
You definitely fucked up.

4206
02:02:08.070 --> 02:02:10.500
There was a woman in France recently who died.

4207
02:02:10.501 --> 02:02:13.590
She fell like 900 feet toward death off a cliff.

4208
02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:16.480
And by the time they got to where the vultures that are already eating there,

4209
02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:17.731
there was nothing left.

4210
02:02:17.731 --> 02:02:18.564
But bones,

4211
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:21.480
she is also how you know you fucked up.

4212
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:22.080
Yeah.

4213
02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:22.501
First of all,

4214
02:02:22.501 --> 02:02:24.900
if you're in a place where they're not killing the vultures have,

4215
02:02:24.901 --> 02:02:25.351
but it's like,

4216
02:02:25.351 --> 02:02:26.310
well we need these vultures.

4217
02:02:26.580 --> 02:02:28.280
Well you know what the problem is now they,

4218
02:02:28.370 --> 02:02:28.950
they are,

4219
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:32.970
they have laws in this part of a Europe where you have to kill livestock when

4220
02:02:32.971 --> 02:02:33.540
they die,

4221
02:02:33.540 --> 02:02:34.373
you have to burn them.

4222
02:02:34.530 --> 02:02:35.400
So because of that,

4223
02:02:35.401 --> 02:02:38.250
the vultures don't get tiff naturally play at prey off the livestock.

4224
02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:41.820
So vultures are actually going down and attacking live things cause they're

4225
02:02:41.821 --> 02:02:45.170
starving to death because the government cleans up the dead animals and burns

4226
02:02:45.171 --> 02:02:47.100
them and doesn't allow the vultures to eat them.

4227
02:02:47.250 --> 02:02:51.300
So now you have vultures that are caring way dogs and they're going after pets.

4228
02:02:51.301 --> 02:02:52.980
They're getting livestock and shit.

4229
02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:54.480
It's like teachers are scary.

4230
02:02:54.510 --> 02:02:55.410
Flowcharts are scary.

4231
02:02:55.470 --> 02:02:56.101
That's,

4232
02:02:56.101 --> 02:02:56.311
you know,

4233
02:02:56.311 --> 02:02:57.930
as much as the oh sweet,

4234
02:02:57.960 --> 02:02:58.291
cool.

4235
02:02:58.291 --> 02:02:58.831
That nature.

4236
02:02:58.831 --> 02:02:59.664
Well yeah.

4237
02:03:00.130 --> 02:03:02.190
To what point [inaudible] nature is nice and cool.

4238
02:03:02.191 --> 02:03:05.190
As long as you're in your car when you're in your house or you have a gun,

4239
02:03:05.191 --> 02:03:05.580
right.

4240
02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:06.031
Or there's,

4241
02:03:06.031 --> 02:03:06.720
you know,

4242
02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:08.520
slow people behind you and in front of you,

4243
02:03:08.521 --> 02:03:09.590
that will get eaten first.

4244
02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:10.920
Exactly.

4245
02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:13.200
I had a dream last night that a friend of mine,

4246
02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:13.590
um,

4247
02:03:13.590 --> 02:03:14.670
have like a,

4248
02:03:14.690 --> 02:03:18.180
an animal snuck into his house and we couldn't get it out and it wasn't a big

4249
02:03:18.181 --> 02:03:18.490
animal.

4250
02:03:18.490 --> 02:03:19.680
It's like a raccoon or something.

4251
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:21.510
But it was terrifying in this dream.

4252
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.931
You know,

4253
02:03:21.931 --> 02:03:24.150
like the raccoon was behind the TV and we're trying to chase it out.

4254
02:03:24.151 --> 02:03:27.030
What sticks and it's like making it like fuck shit.

4255
02:03:27.230 --> 02:03:27.451
You know,

4256
02:03:27.451 --> 02:03:30.630
like think about how little the goddamn raccoon isn't that terrified of this

4257
02:03:30.631 --> 02:03:31.460
fucker,

4258
02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:31.681
you know,

4259
02:03:31.681 --> 02:03:32.700
get them out of your house man.

4260
02:03:32.701 --> 02:03:32.911
You know,

4261
02:03:32.911 --> 02:03:33.744
we're trying to stick,

4262
02:03:33.810 --> 02:03:36.150
stick a fucking broom stick back there to get rid of the raccoons.

4263
02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:38.010
And in my dream it was horrific.

4264
02:03:38.011 --> 02:03:38.400
It was,

4265
02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:41.190
cause I was thinking if this raccoon just goes for it right.

4266
02:03:41.191 --> 02:03:42.360
And just jumps on my face,

4267
02:03:42.361 --> 02:03:43.230
I am fucked.

4268
02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:45.180
My face has made it a toilet paper.

4269
02:03:45.181 --> 02:03:46.080
It's a like soft,

4270
02:03:46.081 --> 02:03:46.861
mushy shit.

4271
02:03:46.861 --> 02:03:47.694
Right.

4272
02:03:47.790 --> 02:03:48.050
You know,

4273
02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:50.820
your you face is barely more durable than a flashlight.

4274
02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:51.600
Yup.

4275
02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:52.433
As it could have.

4276
02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:55.380
<v 3>Raccoons and skunks both scare me because in my backyard,</v>

4277
02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:55.660
yeah.

4278
02:03:55.660 --> 02:03:58.900
Somehow they get in there once in a while and have like a fenced in yard.

4279
02:03:59.110 --> 02:04:00.370
Do you leave cat food out there?

4280
02:04:00.430 --> 02:04:00.790
No.

4281
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:01.150
No,

4282
02:04:01.150 --> 02:04:02.770
but somehow they just do it.

4283
02:04:02.771 --> 02:04:03.191
Like there's,

4284
02:04:03.191 --> 02:04:05.710
it's weird and I'll just be sitting outside,

4285
02:04:05.711 --> 02:04:06.100
you know,

4286
02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:10.000
whatever on the porch and out of nowhere I'll just see like the skunk or a

4287
02:04:10.001 --> 02:04:12.040
raccoon like running towards me cause it's like,

4288
02:04:12.041 --> 02:04:14.440
it doesn't realize that I'm sitting there and I'd be like,

4289
02:04:14.441 --> 02:04:14.680
Hey,

4290
02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:15.341
get away from here.

4291
02:04:15.341 --> 02:04:16.240
And they said it just stops.

4292
02:04:16.241 --> 02:04:16.660
I'm like,

4293
02:04:16.660 --> 02:04:17.350
okay.

4294
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:20.100
Hopefully it just turns around and walks away and nothing happened.

4295
02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:23.680
<v 2>Most of the times they won't engage you unless they're rabid.</v>

4296
02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:24.220
Right,

4297
02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:24.430
right.

4298
02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:26.140
But they will engage you if they're rabid.

4299
02:04:26.170 --> 02:04:26.410
Yup.

4300
02:04:26.410 --> 02:04:26.920
Yeah.

4301
02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:27.340
You know,

4302
02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:30.860
there's that tours that you're really fucked if you get bitten and you've got,

4303
02:04:31.450 --> 02:04:32.400
if you get rabies,

4304
02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:33.700
you get bit by some with rabies,

4305
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:38.050
you got to get like 10 gigantic needles and their

4306
02:04:38.050 --> 02:04:38.611
<v 1>stomach.</v>

4307
02:04:38.611 --> 02:04:38.801
Right.

4308
02:04:38.801 --> 02:04:39.990
It doesn't go around your stomach.

4309
02:04:40.050 --> 02:04:40.440
Oh,

4310
02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:41.580
fucking Christ.

4311
02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:43.110
And they're huge needles.

4312
02:04:43.170 --> 02:04:43.710
Yeah.

4313
02:04:43.710 --> 02:04:46.050
It's apparently like really bad to get rabies.

4314
02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:48.030
<v 5>I got beat by a dog whines and uh,</v>

4315
02:04:48.050 --> 02:04:48.390
you know,

4316
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.931
they worked at,

4317
02:04:48.931 --> 02:04:50.280
to me the doctor was like,

4318
02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:51.061
yeah,

4319
02:04:51.061 --> 02:04:53.660
we're not going to give you a shit because of the take your chances.

4320
02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:55.410
He's better than taking a rabies shot.

4321
02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:56.280
You don't want to ever,

4322
02:04:56.580 --> 02:04:58.920
unless you're really convinced that you have rabies,

4323
02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:01.580
you don't want to take it and be on bed.

4324
02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:02.041
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

4325
02:05:02.041 --> 02:05:04.550
I guess there's a lot of bats here in Los Angeles.

4326
02:05:04.570 --> 02:05:06.330
Then being found with rabies,

4327
02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:06.830
payback,

4328
02:05:06.830 --> 02:05:07.663
fucking Christ,

4329
02:05:08.140 --> 02:05:08.973
Bam,

4330
02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:10.080
Bam.

4331
02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:11.910
I'm wearing a back country tee shirts on.

4332
02:05:12.270 --> 02:05:13.031
Hey Dude,

4333
02:05:13.031 --> 02:05:13.980
who gave me this New Jersey.

4334
02:05:14.010 --> 02:05:14.843
Thank you very much.

4335
02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:17.940
Some fellow hunter s Thompson fan country.

4336
02:05:18.090 --> 02:05:18.923
Yeah.

4337
02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:23.940
There's a great story about these guys from Harvard who went to Africa to study

4338
02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:29.240
these bats that migrate out of this cave and they sat in the front of the cave

4339
02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:33.690
and every night at a certain time when you know it became dusk,

4340
02:05:33.930 --> 02:05:38.700
these bats would fly out and mass is this massive number of bats.

4341
02:05:38.701 --> 02:05:42.690
This is an enormous cave and they would be like millions and millions of bats.

4342
02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:44.370
Well these guys,

4343
02:05:44.371 --> 02:05:47.670
they sat down in front of this like film and record things,

4344
02:05:47.671 --> 02:05:49.230
whatever the fuck they're going to do scientifically.

4345
02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:54.440
And what they didn't anticipate is the assault of bat shit that hit them as they

4346
02:05:56.971 --> 02:05:58.950
came out of this cage.

4347
02:05:58.980 --> 02:06:00.960
They just shit all at once.

4348
02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:05.820
So they were literally in the firing path of a wave of shit.

4349
02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:07.500
A hundred miles high.

4350
02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:09.930
Millions of bats shitting on their face.

4351
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.980
Okay.

4352
02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:12.630
So they get back to uh,

4353
02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:17.460
to America and they're horribly ill bleeding from their eyes.

4354
02:06:17.570 --> 02:06:19.440
There are deadly sick and they die.

4355
02:06:19.590 --> 02:06:20.550
They both died.

4356
02:06:21.570 --> 02:06:22.380
Both died.

4357
02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:22.710
Yeah.

4358
02:06:22.710 --> 02:06:24.240
It's insanely toxic.

4359
02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:28.560
They just got toxic levels of nitrogen and bat shit and it goes in your eyes and

4360
02:06:28.561 --> 02:06:30.690
it's in your face and your skin is good.

4361
02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:33.990
It's in going through your fucking skin when it's toxic shit

4362
02:06:35.010 --> 02:06:35.670
<v 5>took about,</v>

4363
02:06:35.670 --> 02:06:36.311
fuck man,

4364
02:06:36.311 --> 02:06:36.801
I took about it.

4365
02:06:36.801 --> 02:06:38.270
Stories like what happened to him,

4366
02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:38.790
what a,

4367
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:39.061
you know,

4368
02:06:39.061 --> 02:06:42.180
a bunch of media on birds took a shit on him and that's why he died.

4369
02:06:42.181 --> 02:06:42.391
It's like,

4370
02:06:42.391 --> 02:06:43.224
yeah.

4371
02:06:43.250 --> 02:06:47.660
<v 1>And he must've realized somewhere in the middle of that shit storm that probably</v>

4372
02:06:47.661 --> 02:06:48.740
lasted an hour.

4373
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:49.070
You know,

4374
02:06:49.070 --> 02:06:50.400
it was probably an hour of bats.

4375
02:06:50.570 --> 02:06:50.751
I mean,

4376
02:06:50.751 --> 02:06:51.430
there's,

4377
02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:53.930
this is insanely big cave apparently,

4378
02:06:53.931 --> 02:06:55.700
and there's just millions of bats there.

4379
02:06:56.180 --> 02:06:57.800
Bat Guano is,

4380
02:06:57.801 --> 02:06:58.160
uh,

4381
02:06:58.160 --> 02:06:59.480
I know they use it for shit.

4382
02:06:59.481 --> 02:07:01.610
I think they use it for fertilizer and stuff,

4383
02:07:01.611 --> 02:07:02.420
but only in the weeds.

4384
02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:04.810
Big Is it big powerful.

4385
02:07:04.840 --> 02:07:07.610
Daniela [inaudible] got the knowledge,

4386
02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:09.140
um,

4387
02:07:09.140 --> 02:07:12.800
that story that we talked about a couple of weeks ago about the couple that used

4388
02:07:12.801 --> 02:07:14.000
to be in the CIA.

4389
02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:14.480
Uh,

4390
02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:18.230
and they had a retired and we're making plants in their basement.

4391
02:07:18.231 --> 02:07:19.970
They were growing tomatoes and stuff like that.

4392
02:07:20.150 --> 02:07:22.370
And the fucking DEA kicks down their door,

4393
02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:27.400
guns blazing rifles in their face and finds their tomatoes and the basement boy,

4394
02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:30.350
oh boy.

4395
02:07:30.380 --> 02:07:32.890
Is that a silly goddamn storage.

4396
02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:34.040
What turns out these,

4397
02:07:34.041 --> 02:07:34.520
uh,

4398
02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:35.170
people,

4399
02:07:35.170 --> 02:07:35.560
um,

4400
02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:36.070
the reason

4401
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:39.640
<v 2>why the CIA did this or the DEA did this is they,</v>

4402
02:07:39.641 --> 02:07:39.880
uh,

4403
02:07:39.880 --> 02:07:41.410
followed their car.

4404
02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:45.730
Their car had been parked at a hydroponic store and they took a photo of the

4405
02:07:45.731 --> 02:07:46.121
car,

4406
02:07:46.121 --> 02:07:46.960
the license plate.

4407
02:07:46.961 --> 02:07:48.280
They ran the plates.

4408
02:07:48.490 --> 02:07:50.710
And that's how they find where the houses are,

4409
02:07:50.711 --> 02:07:51.670
where people are growing.

4410
02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:57.180
That's this genius fucking group of ASP fucks called the DEA that think that

4411
02:07:58.151 --> 02:08:00.820
everyone growing anything indoors.

4412
02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:05.110
My sister's ex husband used to grow tomatoes and shit cause they lived in

4413
02:08:05.111 --> 02:08:05.550
Boston.

4414
02:08:05.550 --> 02:08:07.000
They had a full set up in the basement.

4415
02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:07.331
Right,

4416
02:08:07.331 --> 02:08:08.140
and even smoke weed.

4417
02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:08.490
Right.

4418
02:08:08.490 --> 02:08:09.360
We had a full set up,

4419
02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:11.560
but that guy would be like under suspicion.

4420
02:08:11.590 --> 02:08:12.490
Of course if you,

4421
02:08:12.491 --> 02:08:12.840
if they,

4422
02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:14.530
they're allowed to pass by your fucking house.

4423
02:08:14.531 --> 02:08:16.570
This is how stupid this such as this situation is.

4424
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:18.220
All they're doing is growing plants.

4425
02:08:18.221 --> 02:08:18.551
By the way,

4426
02:08:18.551 --> 02:08:19.240
I might add,

4427
02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:20.110
but not making math.

4428
02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:20.590
Okay.

4429
02:08:20.590 --> 02:08:21.340
Right.

4430
02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:21.641
The,

4431
02:08:21.641 --> 02:08:25.060
they're allowed to go by the places where they teach you how to grow plants.

4432
02:08:25.210 --> 02:08:30.190
Take pictures of your fucking license plate and then run them on the suspicion

4433
02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:31.330
of you doing drugs.

4434
02:08:31.331 --> 02:08:32.470
Find out what the fuck you live.

4435
02:08:32.471 --> 02:08:33.460
Stake out your house.

4436
02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:33.911
Yup.

4437
02:08:33.911 --> 02:08:34.421
For sure.

4438
02:08:34.421 --> 02:08:35.500
They're growing plants.

4439
02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:40.560
We're going in boys go in guns blazing with dogs and shoot your dog.

4440
02:08:40.721 --> 02:08:41.554
If you've got one,

4441
02:08:41.770 --> 02:08:43.030
they shoot your fucking dog.

4442
02:08:43.150 --> 02:08:44.920
Almost every time they go into these people's houses,

4443
02:08:45.070 --> 02:08:46.270
they shoot puppies,

4444
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:47.710
they'll shoot collies.

4445
02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:49.120
They don't care if your dog is a threat,

4446
02:08:49.121 --> 02:08:52.090
they shoot dogs and then they find out you're making tomatoes.

4447
02:08:52.850 --> 02:08:54.070
I mean that's the dumbest shit.

4448
02:08:54.071 --> 02:08:56.410
That's why to meet piece me off when I or people who are like,

4449
02:08:56.710 --> 02:08:59.380
I love the freedom but I'm pro drug war.

4450
02:08:59.381 --> 02:09:01.480
I'm against legal prostitution and I'm against,

4451
02:09:01.481 --> 02:09:03.260
it's like [inaudible] motherfucker.

4452
02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:05.290
You're only put the freedom of the stuff you like.

4453
02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:06.213
That's just,

4454
02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:09.100
well Obama said recently you had a um,

4455
02:09:09.101 --> 02:09:10.060
a speech in Mexico.

4456
02:09:10.061 --> 02:09:12.910
He said that he didn't think that making marijuana legal was a good idea.

4457
02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:18.580
So the muscle Arius thing ever like the idea that making anything that EI

4458
02:09:18.581 --> 02:09:22.480
benefits people [inaudible] people want to do and see there's no victims,

4459
02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:22.781
right.

4460
02:09:22.781 --> 02:09:23.614
To say that.

4461
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:27.250
And then you're talking specifically with the people who would,

4462
02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:30.430
in a logical scenario benefit from being legal.

4463
02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:35.110
The reason why all this money is being made by drug cartels is because drugs are

4464
02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:35.700
illegal,

4465
02:09:35.700 --> 02:09:36.040
right?

4466
02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:37.060
If drugs were legal,

4467
02:09:37.061 --> 02:09:38.680
these people wouldn't be making that money.

4468
02:09:38.710 --> 02:09:39.580
I would have a business.

4469
02:09:39.970 --> 02:09:40.331
I mean,

4470
02:09:40.331 --> 02:09:44.020
just that alone is impossible for some people to grasp.

4471
02:09:44.370 --> 02:09:44.801
And I mean,

4472
02:09:44.801 --> 02:09:46.930
even when people that are against each fetal is off,

4473
02:09:46.931 --> 02:09:51.100
it could it because they are control freaks who want to some morality for us

4474
02:09:51.101 --> 02:09:53.800
according to their standards of morality to and everyone else.

4475
02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:57.130
Even those guys still look at the evidence.

4476
02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:01.680
Eastbourne be fun working in terms of keeping dry the rates of addiction in

4477
02:10:01.690 --> 02:10:02.860
order use low.

4478
02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:03.640
It's not,

4479
02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:04.810
so what the fuck are you doing it?

4480
02:10:04.811 --> 02:10:06.250
She's like taking a bunch of money,

4481
02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:11.140
putting it in the toilet and flushing because if you are not affecting demand or

4482
02:10:11.141 --> 02:10:11.974
supply,

4483
02:10:12.190 --> 02:10:13.240
why the fuck are you doing it?

4484
02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:13.480
Yeah.

4485
02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:17.260
The best example that we have about whether or not it's good to legalize drugs

4486
02:10:17.261 --> 02:10:17.950
as Portugal.

4487
02:10:17.950 --> 02:10:18.440
Yeah,

4488
02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:19.060
I have to do with it.

4489
02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:21.500
And they have lowered their rates of addiction,

4490
02:10:21.550 --> 02:10:22.990
lowered the rates of crime.

4491
02:10:23.390 --> 02:10:23.770
It's,

4492
02:10:23.770 --> 02:10:24.940
it's real simple folks.

4493
02:10:24.941 --> 02:10:28.060
People don't like being told what to do and they're going to do whatever the

4494
02:10:28.061 --> 02:10:29.200
fuck they want to do.

4495
02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:30.730
But if you tell him what to do,

4496
02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:31.750
then they're going to rebel.

4497
02:10:32.110 --> 02:10:33.040
And that's just what they do.

4498
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:34.160
And when people rebel,

4499
02:10:34.161 --> 02:10:36.140
sometimes they're not even doing what they want to do.

4500
02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:38.390
They're just doing what you don't want them to do.

4501
02:10:38.391 --> 02:10:41.480
So that seems like the thing to do because they don't like you fucking

4502
02:10:41.481 --> 02:10:42.314
controlling them.

4503
02:10:42.750 --> 02:10:43.310
You know?

4504
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:44.930
When I moved here from Italy,

4505
02:10:44.931 --> 02:10:48.020
I didn't know about the age 21 thing about drinking.

4506
02:10:48.220 --> 02:10:49.940
I thought you're going to say about banging chicks.

4507
02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.710
There's a like easily,

4508
02:10:53.730 --> 02:10:54.830
I don't even think he died.

4509
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:56.630
Maybe it doesn't have an age limit.

4510
02:10:56.631 --> 02:10:58.080
If he does nobody on force it.

4511
02:10:58.090 --> 02:10:59.830
So if you are eight year old,

4512
02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:02.990
you go to the store to buy for your mom a bottle of wine.

4513
02:11:02.991 --> 02:11:03.920
Nobody asks anything.

4514
02:11:04.730 --> 02:11:08.930
But because it's the kind of shit that your grandparents have for lunch,

4515
02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:10.130
it's not glamorous.

4516
02:11:10.190 --> 02:11:11.023
It's not like,

4517
02:11:11.060 --> 02:11:11.481
cool,

4518
02:11:11.481 --> 02:11:12.141
I got booze.

4519
02:11:12.141 --> 02:11:16.880
I'm going to start down and get like crazy when I still a year people who would

4520
02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:19.360
start drinking as teenagers as a,

4521
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:21.950
but it'll keep me that exciting thing they would down.

4522
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:22.970
I'll go like crazy,

4523
02:11:22.971 --> 02:11:24.350
throw up all over themselves.

4524
02:11:24.351 --> 02:11:24.910
I'm like,

4525
02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:25.400
Hey,

4526
02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:26.360
that's fucking disgusting.

4527
02:11:26.361 --> 02:11:27.620
Why would you do that to yourselves?

4528
02:11:27.621 --> 02:11:27.861
You know?

4529
02:11:27.861 --> 02:11:28.520
It's like,

4530
02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:29.240
yeah,

4531
02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:29.481
you know,

4532
02:11:29.481 --> 02:11:31.700
you'll learn how to drink a little bit at a time.

4533
02:11:31.701 --> 02:11:34.220
And to me it's like you learn how to drink as a kid.

4534
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:36.860
You learn how to drink with your grandparents,

4535
02:11:36.861 --> 02:11:37.341
where he's like,

4536
02:11:37.341 --> 02:11:38.174
if you have a seat,

4537
02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:39.800
you feel happy and stuff.

4538
02:11:39.801 --> 02:11:40.521
If you have more than a,

4539
02:11:40.521 --> 02:11:42.280
see if you've got a headache kind of one day you do,

4540
02:11:42.290 --> 02:11:42.681
and you're like,

4541
02:11:42.681 --> 02:11:43.101
oh fuck,

4542
02:11:43.101 --> 02:11:43.551
you're right,

4543
02:11:43.551 --> 02:11:44.301
I got a headache.

4544
02:11:44.301 --> 02:11:47.360
And it's kind of weird that this is the most successful society ever,

4545
02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:48.411
because it really is,

4546
02:11:48.411 --> 02:11:48.681
right.

4547
02:11:48.681 --> 02:11:50.680
If you had to look at it as far as like the what,

4548
02:11:50.681 --> 02:11:52.640
what's been done by this society,

4549
02:11:52.650 --> 02:11:53.483
American society,

4550
02:11:54.110 --> 02:11:56.900
maybe that's the only way you can really get shit done.

4551
02:11:56.900 --> 02:11:59.570
Maybe you have to have this fucking weird button down,

4552
02:11:59.571 --> 02:12:02.120
repressed in order to work that kind of hours.

4553
02:12:02.121 --> 02:12:03.050
And people were willing to work.

4554
02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:04.950
Whereas in Italy they'd take like,

4555
02:12:04.970 --> 02:12:05.240
what,

4556
02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:07.810
two hours a day off just to take a shit.

4557
02:12:07.811 --> 02:12:08.810
And nobody does that.

4558
02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:10.250
Have a shoot the brick,

4559
02:12:10.750 --> 02:12:11.061
you know,

4560
02:12:11.061 --> 02:12:13.100
he's an awesome place to retiring,

4561
02:12:13.190 --> 02:12:14.600
but to get anything done.

4562
02:12:14.630 --> 02:12:14.841
Yeah.

4563
02:12:14.841 --> 02:12:15.400
Good luck.

4564
02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:15.581
Well,

4565
02:12:15.581 --> 02:12:17.720
I know marvelous Marvin Hagler did it.

4566
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:18.470
Yup.

4567
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:22.190
Marvin Hagler when he retired from being,

4568
02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:23.810
you know the fucking man.

4569
02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:24.330
Yup.

4570
02:12:24.330 --> 02:12:24.810
Uh,

4571
02:12:24.810 --> 02:12:26.690
was one of the best boxers ever.

4572
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:28.070
Went to Italy and just said,

4573
02:12:28.071 --> 02:12:28.431
fuck it.

4574
02:12:28.431 --> 02:12:29.630
I'm just chilling here forever.

4575
02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:32.630
It can be come up Italian movie star and he lives in my town.

4576
02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:37.710
A friend of mine told me that you're answering to it and at the GMO,

4577
02:12:37.770 --> 02:12:39.640
the time and their various,

4578
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:40.641
he's a weird,

4579
02:12:40.641 --> 02:12:43.820
he's the weirdest case ever for a boxer because he still has his wins.

4580
02:12:43.850 --> 02:12:44.400
Yeah,

4581
02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:44.930
he was.

4582
02:12:44.930 --> 02:12:45.531
And Man,

4583
02:12:45.531 --> 02:12:46.311
what a good boxer.

4584
02:12:46.311 --> 02:12:47.144
He was amazing.

4585
02:12:47.180 --> 02:12:48.280
He was one of the all time greats,

4586
02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:49.341
but he's still like,

4587
02:12:49.341 --> 02:12:53.210
he's lucid when he talks and he lost to sugar ray Leonard and he said,

4588
02:12:53.211 --> 02:12:53.960
that's it.

4589
02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:54.680
I'm done.

4590
02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:55.030
Right.

4591
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.191
And,

4592
02:12:55.191 --> 02:12:56.330
but he really meant it.

4593
02:12:56.331 --> 02:12:58.490
He's the only guy that I can ever recall.

4594
02:12:58.570 --> 02:12:59.030
Nope.

4595
02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.721
Everybody out.

4596
02:12:59.721 --> 02:13:01.580
Like sugar ray Leonard broke everybody's heart.

4597
02:13:01.750 --> 02:13:02.510
He came back,

4598
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:03.140
right.

4599
02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:03.411
One,

4600
02:13:03.411 --> 02:13:05.240
a couple of fights and then lost a couple of fights.

4601
02:13:05.241 --> 02:13:05.841
Very bad.

4602
02:13:05.841 --> 02:13:06.290
Right.

4603
02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:07.310
The Terry Norris fight.

4604
02:13:07.670 --> 02:13:08.361
Classic example.

4605
02:13:08.361 --> 02:13:09.830
That was a brutal beat down.

4606
02:13:09.831 --> 02:13:10.340
Yeah.

4607
02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:11.790
Terry Noyes beat the shit out of them.

4608
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:13.340
That was scary.

4609
02:13:13.540 --> 02:13:13.861
The,

4610
02:13:13.861 --> 02:13:14.270
um,

4611
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:14.470
the,

4612
02:13:14.470 --> 02:13:17.150
the fight with Hector Camacho and Hector Camacho stopped him and was like,

4613
02:13:17.151 --> 02:13:17.900
oh Jesus.

4614
02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:18.560
You know,

4615
02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:20.000
he was at the end.

4616
02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:22.130
He broke everybody's heart just like everybody else.

4617
02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:22.431
Right.

4618
02:13:22.431 --> 02:13:22.671
It's no,

4619
02:13:22.671 --> 02:13:22.810
I,

4620
02:13:22.810 --> 02:13:23.600
there was martyred man.

4621
02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:24.291
He made the call.

4622
02:13:24.291 --> 02:13:26.450
He didn't really take that much abuse actually.

4623
02:13:26.451 --> 02:13:29.300
He actually took more up using some of the fights he wall like there was the

4624
02:13:29.301 --> 02:13:30.210
fight with Mugabi.

4625
02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:30.650
Yeah.

4626
02:13:30.650 --> 02:13:34.410
Where they beat the shit out of each other or even the one with Tom he earns

4627
02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:38.310
that was like the most intense around have ever seen in combat sports.

4628
02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:38.580
Yeah.

4629
02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:42.770
You want to watch a great fight there from Hagler Hearns on Youtube.

4630
02:13:42.810 --> 02:13:44.480
Somebody put it up on a end.

4631
02:13:44.490 --> 02:13:45.420
Rick Soundtrack.

4632
02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:48.570
They have like Voodoo child going on.

4633
02:13:48.571 --> 02:13:52.660
The Marvin Hagler highlight is like the coolest thing ever.

4634
02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:53.520
Yeah,

4635
02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:55.050
I tweeted that a while back.

4636
02:13:55.230 --> 02:13:56.610
That's an amazing highlight.

4637
02:13:56.611 --> 02:13:57.090
Yeah.

4638
02:13:57.090 --> 02:13:57.271
Yeah.

4639
02:13:57.271 --> 02:13:58.410
He was a beast man.

4640
02:13:58.440 --> 02:13:59.273
He was a,

4641
02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:01.380
when I was a kid he was a big inspiration for me.

4642
02:14:01.490 --> 02:14:04.990
I was living in Boston cause I remember he was supposed to fight Mustapha Ham

4643
02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.590
show and they had some TV special that was following him,

4644
02:14:07.591 --> 02:14:08.910
training in the,

4645
02:14:08.911 --> 02:14:12.570
and he would go to the Cape in the winter time whereas nobody in the Cape,

4646
02:14:12.571 --> 02:14:14.350
it's horrible bowl,

4647
02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:16.110
right for reasoning,

4648
02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:16.831
you know,

4649
02:14:16.831 --> 02:14:17.251
many,

4650
02:14:17.251 --> 02:14:19.860
many degrees below zero windchill factor.

4651
02:14:19.950 --> 02:14:23.670
Wind coming off the wall or ripping your fucking skin apart and he's out there

4652
02:14:23.671 --> 02:14:24.121
running,

4653
02:14:24.121 --> 02:14:25.890
screaming war.

4654
02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:30.450
She would just scream war as he was running up sand dunes and shit.

4655
02:14:30.510 --> 02:14:32.990
Fuck if he's the phone and you just look at Devita,

4656
02:14:33.090 --> 02:14:33.660
they're like,

4657
02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:34.050
yeah,

4658
02:14:34.050 --> 02:14:34.883
no thanks.

4659
02:14:35.260 --> 02:14:36.690
He beat the fuck out of some people,

4660
02:14:36.691 --> 02:14:37.090
man.

4661
02:14:37.090 --> 02:14:37.380
Even higher.

4662
02:14:37.380 --> 02:14:38.400
It was a beast.

4663
02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:39.030
Yeah.

4664
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:42.360
If you look at the Mugabi fight is a great example of that.

4665
02:14:42.361 --> 02:14:42.830
He just,

4666
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:43.740
you couldn't hurt him.

4667
02:14:44.100 --> 02:14:45.480
He had a chin like nobody,

4668
02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:46.860
he had like they've,

4669
02:14:46.890 --> 02:14:49.500
they did like this weird thing with them with a,

4670
02:14:49.501 --> 02:14:50.010
um,

4671
02:14:50.010 --> 02:14:54.360
they scanned his head and they found out that his mandible muscles,

4672
02:14:54.361 --> 02:14:58.260
the muscles on the sides of his head were like much larger than a normal

4673
02:14:58.261 --> 02:14:59.030
persons.

4674
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.431
And they were like,

4675
02:14:59.431 --> 02:15:03.240
literally the man has like builtin headgear and you're like,

4676
02:15:03.241 --> 02:15:03.420
wait,

4677
02:15:03.420 --> 02:15:06.450
I guess he get that from biting down maybe or something.

4678
02:15:06.451 --> 02:15:09.900
Or biting down on mouthpieces or what if it could be genetics?

4679
02:15:10.050 --> 02:15:10.171
Well,

4680
02:15:10.171 --> 02:15:10.861
whatever it was,

4681
02:15:10.861 --> 02:15:14.850
the dude was just like really hard to hurt and that was one of the big things

4682
02:15:14.851 --> 02:15:15.200
about him.

4683
02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:16.080
Like you could never hurt.

4684
02:15:16.081 --> 02:15:17.340
Like Tommy Hearns couldn't hurt them.

4685
02:15:17.350 --> 02:15:18.270
It Gabi couldn't hurt him.

4686
02:15:18.420 --> 02:15:19.141
They would nail it,

4687
02:15:19.141 --> 02:15:20.280
but he would just keep coming forward.

4688
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:22.080
Nobody ever stopped Marvin Hagler.

4689
02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:24.350
Nobody ever stopped Marvin Hagler no,

4690
02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:25.260
not even close.

4691
02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:28.830
Nobody even fucking came close to stop in that guy.

4692
02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:30.061
Yeah.

4693
02:15:30.061 --> 02:15:33.270
There's been a few guys like that throughout history that just for whatever

4694
02:15:33.271 --> 02:15:33.661
reason,

4695
02:15:33.661 --> 02:15:38.490
just had that extra motivation above and beyond everyone else.

4696
02:15:38.730 --> 02:15:40.470
And he was Marco call it quits when he did.

4697
02:15:40.471 --> 02:15:42.100
Because I mean you do see those guys a,

4698
02:15:42.140 --> 02:15:45.680
I know gay or I left these ungodly chains who can take Sam be it was,

4699
02:15:46.140 --> 02:15:47.700
but after a while,

4700
02:15:47.730 --> 02:15:51.560
you know you hit the spot to where he's like okay you'll clock the x amount of

4701
02:15:51.561 --> 02:15:53.580
mantras you could take in your life is done.

4702
02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:53.900
Yeah.

4703
02:15:53.900 --> 02:15:55.950
Now every other funds you take is going to throw up you.

4704
02:15:57.090 --> 02:15:57.391
Yeah.

4705
02:15:57.391 --> 02:15:57.660
That's,

4706
02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:01.600
that's gets really sad to see old great fighters that don't,

4707
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:04.320
that's what the saddest aspects of fighting and what,

4708
02:16:04.321 --> 02:16:07.260
it'd be amazing if they figured out how to fix that with like stem cell

4709
02:16:07.261 --> 02:16:08.094
research.

4710
02:16:08.130 --> 02:16:08.761
Like to figure it out.

4711
02:16:08.761 --> 02:16:13.080
How to reverse pugilistic dementia and cure brain damage from fighting.

4712
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:14.640
That would be beautiful.

4713
02:16:14.670 --> 02:16:14.761
Yeah.

4714
02:16:14.761 --> 02:16:16.720
Cause it makes it seem twice about training.

4715
02:16:16.750 --> 02:16:19.860
Stand up sparring for real because you know,

4716
02:16:19.861 --> 02:16:20.580
you'll get out board.

4717
02:16:20.580 --> 02:16:21.341
It's all the themes,

4718
02:16:21.341 --> 02:16:21.630
right.

4719
02:16:21.630 --> 02:16:22.390
And socks.

4720
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:27.240
But he's gotten bad concussions from grappling fall funding,

4721
02:16:27.550 --> 02:16:28.010
you know,

4722
02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:28.980
and a lot of,

4723
02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:29.820
you know,

4724
02:16:29.820 --> 02:16:30.100
a lot

4725
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:34.180
<v 1>of heads collide with knees and accidental things happen where you get knocked</v>

4726
02:16:34.181 --> 02:16:35.014
unconscious.

4727
02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:36.430
You're taking a chance to matter what you do.

4728
02:16:36.431 --> 02:16:39.610
But it's the subconcussive blows from boxing.

4729
02:16:39.611 --> 02:16:42.700
The continual process of getting hit.

4730
02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:44.560
Yeah cause that's not an accident in training.

4731
02:16:44.590 --> 02:16:45.550
That's the name of the game.

4732
02:16:45.551 --> 02:16:49.150
He's continuing to head and you'd take it over and over and over after a while,

4733
02:16:49.151 --> 02:16:49.984
you know they're all,

4734
02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:52.210
there's can be a good thing for your brain.

4735
02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:55.900
Especially if you're training with some fucking animal who hits hard.

4736
02:16:56.350 --> 02:16:59.110
If you're in there with like some guy on a regular basis and he likes to beat up

4737
02:16:59.111 --> 02:16:59.980
sparring partners.

4738
02:17:00.130 --> 02:17:00.431
Great.

4739
02:17:00.431 --> 02:17:01.890
You just got a little stupid or every day.

4740
02:17:01.900 --> 02:17:03.070
Exactly every day in your life.

4741
02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:04.060
Get a little stupider.

4742
02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:05.270
How would he do,

4743
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:06.340
he was like when you aspire,

4744
02:17:06.370 --> 02:17:08.080
because when you get apple is easy,

4745
02:17:08.081 --> 02:17:09.770
you know as long as you are not a daycare,

4746
02:17:09.780 --> 02:17:10.570
not going to hurt people.

4747
02:17:10.570 --> 02:17:12.280
Why these accidents happen but just fine.

4748
02:17:12.281 --> 02:17:13.310
Really good training partners.

4749
02:17:13.311 --> 02:17:13.411
Right.

4750
02:17:13.411 --> 02:17:14.560
What's the most important thing?

4751
02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:14.800
Cause,

4752
02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:18.470
I mean don't you find some time when you are done with the spring session in STI

4753
02:17:18.471 --> 02:17:21.850
keen that sometimes you are not entirely sure how well you did cause he's like,

4754
02:17:21.851 --> 02:17:26.160
you didn't really go full out where you like that shot that I hate him weights.

4755
02:17:26.350 --> 02:17:27.183
Was it sim?

4756
02:17:27.250 --> 02:17:27.610
What?

4757
02:17:27.610 --> 02:17:29.420
Did he have the juice really behind it?

4758
02:17:29.421 --> 02:17:31.870
Told her he would have just shrugged it off and that's it.

4759
02:17:31.871 --> 02:17:32.051
You know,

4760
02:17:32.051 --> 02:17:35.770
it's like does it ever happen to you or do you feel like you know what's up by

4761
02:17:35.771 --> 02:17:36.071
the end?

4762
02:17:36.071 --> 02:17:36.490
Uh,

4763
02:17:36.490 --> 02:17:40.480
well I think you have to like ego wise,

4764
02:17:40.510 --> 02:17:42.910
you have to realize that like when you,

4765
02:17:42.911 --> 02:17:43.930
when you're sparring,

4766
02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:45.400
you're both pulling back.

4767
02:17:45.401 --> 02:17:49.450
So shots that you got hit with you maybe would've got hurt in a,

4768
02:17:49.451 --> 02:17:53.530
in a real situation and shots that you got hit with your response,

4769
02:17:53.650 --> 02:17:55.660
maybe you wouldn't have been able to even deliver it.

4770
02:17:56.230 --> 02:18:00.520
So it can get unrealistic for guys who liked to spar light,

4771
02:18:00.550 --> 02:18:04.450
but they take shots on the Chin and then keep moving forward as if in real life

4772
02:18:04.451 --> 02:18:05.140
they would be okay.

4773
02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:05.431
Right.

4774
02:18:05.431 --> 02:18:07.300
Because that becomes a real problem for sure.

4775
02:18:07.330 --> 02:18:07.510
Right?

4776
02:18:07.510 --> 02:18:11.110
And that's one of the problems with developing techniques under minimal stress.

4777
02:18:11.650 --> 02:18:13.330
But if you're doing it correctly,

4778
02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:14.920
if you're being well trained,

4779
02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:17.860
they want to allow you to develop is really bad habits because those really bad

4780
02:18:17.861 --> 02:18:18.760
habits like you can,

4781
02:18:19.090 --> 02:18:19.660
you can,

4782
02:18:19.660 --> 02:18:23.710
you can fundamentally alter the thinking that allows you to spar like that.

4783
02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:24.070
Right.

4784
02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:25.420
Number one most important thing.

4785
02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:26.410
It's two important things,

4786
02:18:26.411 --> 02:18:27.880
but number one is great trainers.

4787
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:31.690
You have to have a trainer that trains you in a technical way and she makes the

4788
02:18:31.691 --> 02:18:33.880
class move in a tactical way as well.

4789
02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:37.540
And number two train partners that you could trust so you're not going to blast

4790
02:18:37.541 --> 02:18:37.930
each other.

4791
02:18:37.930 --> 02:18:38.440
Yeah.

4792
02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:39.780
And then you've got to make sure that you,

4793
02:18:39.810 --> 02:18:42.340
you go full out on the myths and the bag,

4794
02:18:42.370 --> 02:18:42.581
right.

4795
02:18:42.581 --> 02:18:47.350
So that in a real scenario you can deliver those shots with full impact.

4796
02:18:48.180 --> 02:18:48.460
You know,

4797
02:18:48.460 --> 02:18:48.941
but it's,

4798
02:18:48.941 --> 02:18:50.110
it's a tricky game.

4799
02:18:50.140 --> 02:18:51.490
Striking is a tricky game.

4800
02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:52.210
You know,

4801
02:18:52.210 --> 02:18:53.020
it's a,

4802
02:18:53.020 --> 02:18:53.531
it's a very,

4803
02:18:53.531 --> 02:18:54.640
very dangerous endeavor,

4804
02:18:55.450 --> 02:18:56.610
but it's awesome to get good at.

4805
02:18:56.650 --> 02:18:57.483
Ou

4806
02:18:58.660 --> 02:18:59.081
feels good.

4807
02:18:59.081 --> 02:19:00.070
I everybody's deadline,

4808
02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:00.500
right?

4809
02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:03.530
If you'd do a little too two tell Israeli state cause it's like,

4810
02:19:03.531 --> 02:19:03.840
come on,

4811
02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:06.160
we are barely touching each other.

4812
02:19:06.161 --> 02:19:07.380
If you go a little too hard,

4813
02:19:07.381 --> 02:19:07.841
it does a role.

4814
02:19:07.841 --> 02:19:09.280
Brain cells saying goodbye.

4815
02:19:09.610 --> 02:19:09.911
Yeah.

4816
02:19:09.911 --> 02:19:12.310
My young days when I was a young man,

4817
02:19:12.311 --> 02:19:15.130
one of the things that I was concerned most with was the potential of brain

4818
02:19:15.131 --> 02:19:15.640
damage.

4819
02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:15.910
Yeah.

4820
02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:16.490
You know I,

4821
02:19:16.490 --> 02:19:21.490
I've known too many people that I'd seen slowly slip away from the gym wars and

4822
02:19:22.331 --> 02:19:24.730
kickboxing and boxing training and stuff like that.

4823
02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:26.360
But you know,

4824
02:19:26.770 --> 02:19:30.530
on the hand it's fucking exciting to watch than if people are going to keep

4825
02:19:30.531 --> 02:19:31.040
doing it.

4826
02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:31.530
Like the,

4827
02:19:31.530 --> 02:19:32.160
did you see a,

4828
02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:34.370
the Mayweather fight this weekend and I may wear the red.

4829
02:19:34.371 --> 02:19:36.980
Just kind of take it to the why.

4830
02:19:37.010 --> 02:19:37.843
Why is that?

4831
02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:39.733
It's fucking brilliant.

4832
02:19:40.490 --> 02:19:41.210
Brilliant,

4833
02:19:41.210 --> 02:19:41.690
brilliant.

4834
02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:42.051
Beautiful.

4835
02:19:42.051 --> 02:19:42.640
To Watch.

4836
02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:44.750
If I was fighting at this level,

4837
02:19:44.751 --> 02:19:45.650
I'll probably do the same thing.

4838
02:19:45.651 --> 02:19:45.921
He's like,

4839
02:19:45.921 --> 02:19:46.780
I'm not going to get hurt.

4840
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:48.350
I'm going to get paid a shitload of money.

4841
02:19:48.410 --> 02:19:51.000
I win white the fuck should I take chances?

4842
02:19:51.001 --> 02:19:51.890
So he took chances.

4843
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:52.783
He does.

4844
02:19:52.830 --> 02:19:53.160
You know,

4845
02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:55.040
in this fight is on a very different kind of fight.

4846
02:19:55.041 --> 02:19:56.300
He stood right in front of this dude.

4847
02:19:56.600 --> 02:19:57.860
Robert Guerrero was a tough guy,

4848
02:19:57.861 --> 02:19:58.331
but he,

4849
02:19:58.331 --> 02:19:59.300
he out toughed him.

4850
02:19:59.301 --> 02:20:00.170
He out moved him,

4851
02:20:00.171 --> 02:20:01.100
he out angled them.

4852
02:20:01.250 --> 02:20:05.000
He clinically clenched ahold of them and didn't let them like manipulate him and

4853
02:20:05.001 --> 02:20:06.200
bullying him and rip shots on him,

4854
02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:08.900
and then he'd just counter punch to the fucking shit out of him.

4855
02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:09.201
Man.

4856
02:20:09.201 --> 02:20:09.720
It just,

4857
02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:10.553
it was brilliant.

4858
02:20:10.820 --> 02:20:10.971
I mean,

4859
02:20:10.971 --> 02:20:12.860
it wasn't the most exciting fighter in the world,

4860
02:20:12.861 --> 02:20:15.140
but as someone who appreciates technique,

4861
02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:17.120
I appreciate the shit out how he did it.

4862
02:20:17.470 --> 02:20:17.770
He says,

4863
02:20:17.770 --> 02:20:18.920
just an awesome boxer.

4864
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:19.151
Right?

4865
02:20:19.151 --> 02:20:19.881
It talks crazy,

4866
02:20:19.881 --> 02:20:20.361
mad shit.

4867
02:20:20.361 --> 02:20:21.830
But that's also why people buy is paper.

4868
02:20:21.831 --> 02:20:22.640
Of course.

4869
02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:23.420
I don't know the dude.

4870
02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:23.840
You know me.

4871
02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:25.340
I know the dude's a bad motherfucker though,

4872
02:20:25.370 --> 02:20:25.561
right?

4873
02:20:25.561 --> 02:20:25.670
Yeah.

4874
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:27.050
As far as when it comes to boxing.

4875
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.680
Yeah.

4876
02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:29.390
He's made some crazy claims about MMA,

4877
02:20:29.391 --> 02:20:30.500
which I always find hilarious,

4878
02:20:30.501 --> 02:20:33.350
but I don't fault him for that because he's in the business of promoting.

4879
02:20:33.351 --> 02:20:33.850
Yeah.

4880
02:20:33.850 --> 02:20:34.100
You know,

4881
02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:35.390
that's like part of his shtick is,

4882
02:20:35.391 --> 02:20:35.571
look,

4883
02:20:35.571 --> 02:20:37.760
he knows there's a lot of people that are paying attention to MMA.

4884
02:20:37.970 --> 02:20:40.130
If he starts talking mad shit about MMA fighters,

4885
02:20:40.490 --> 02:20:44.030
people who don't even watch boxing will pay attention to his fight and even to

4886
02:20:44.031 --> 02:20:44.451
buy it,

4887
02:20:44.451 --> 02:20:45.284
to see him lose.

4888
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:48.680
Like I saw some people that I know there were like tweeting,

4889
02:20:48.681 --> 02:20:48.891
you know,

4890
02:20:48.891 --> 02:20:50.390
I think maybe where they're loses this weekend.

4891
02:20:50.391 --> 02:20:50.691
I was like,

4892
02:20:50.691 --> 02:20:52.010
what are you even saying?

4893
02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:53.510
What are you even talking about?

4894
02:20:53.511 --> 02:20:55.430
Do you know what you're watching when you're watching that guy?

4895
02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:59.660
You're watching the all time hall of Famer and Robert Career was a good fighter.

4896
02:20:59.661 --> 02:21:00.530
He's a very good Friday.

4897
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:01.820
It'd be an interesting fight,

4898
02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:03.830
but they were just going to box his fucking face off.

4899
02:21:03.860 --> 02:21:04.693
That's what he's gonna do.

4900
02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:06.110
Cause he's one of the best ever.

4901
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:07.520
I made 80 bucks on him,

4902
02:21:07.521 --> 02:21:09.590
so I was pleased to check what was the odds.

4903
02:21:09.890 --> 02:21:10.631
They got really bad.

4904
02:21:10.631 --> 02:21:11.560
So I took back to lot,

4905
02:21:11.630 --> 02:21:13.010
but I was so sure that it was like,

4906
02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:14.980
cause like there's no way in hell kick.

4907
02:21:15.070 --> 02:21:15.741
It's got a Louis.

4908
02:21:15.741 --> 02:21:16.574
It just,

4909
02:21:16.590 --> 02:21:17.510
it hurt his hand.

4910
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:18.440
That's the only way he can,

4911
02:21:18.441 --> 02:21:19.130
and he did it.

4912
02:21:19.130 --> 02:21:19.671
In fact,

4913
02:21:19.671 --> 02:21:21.560
he hurt his right hand somehow in the fight,

4914
02:21:21.561 --> 02:21:23.650
but he kept throwing it or the John Johnson,

4915
02:21:23.660 --> 02:21:24.210
you know,

4916
02:21:24.210 --> 02:21:25.430
goes Gus was going to win.

4917
02:21:25.431 --> 02:21:26.000
But he's like,

4918
02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:27.680
well shit can happen.

4919
02:21:27.681 --> 02:21:27.921
You know,

4920
02:21:27.921 --> 02:21:28.301
it's like,

4921
02:21:28.301 --> 02:21:28.750
yeah,

4922
02:21:28.750 --> 02:21:29.870
act of God type Shit.

4923
02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:30.371
You know,

4924
02:21:30.371 --> 02:21:30.560
he,

4925
02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:33.340
John John's foot wasn't even broken that toe wasn't even Brooklyn.

4926
02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:36.500
Just dislocated it and twisted it and broke the skin.

4927
02:21:36.610 --> 02:21:37.520
You crazy.

4928
02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:37.820
Yeah.

4929
02:21:37.820 --> 02:21:38.960
But that wasn't even broken.

4930
02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:39.710
And there's like,

4931
02:21:39.710 --> 02:21:41.150
he'll be back training at six weeks.

4932
02:21:41.390 --> 02:21:42.223
Like what?

4933
02:21:42.830 --> 02:21:44.120
Six fucking weeks?

4934
02:21:44.470 --> 02:21:46.160
That looked like a six month injury,

4935
02:21:46.161 --> 02:21:46.701
but apparently,

4936
02:21:46.701 --> 02:21:47.060
nope,

4937
02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:47.893
no problem.

4938
02:21:48.050 --> 02:21:48.261
They,

4939
02:21:48.261 --> 02:21:49.100
as soon as they said it,

4940
02:21:49.130 --> 02:21:49.291
they,

4941
02:21:49.291 --> 02:21:49.520
they,

4942
02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:50.450
they stitched it up,

4943
02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:50.961
the uh,

4944
02:21:50.961 --> 02:21:52.400
the cut set it and they're like,

4945
02:21:52.401 --> 02:21:53.190
you'd be all right.

4946
02:21:53.190 --> 02:21:53.390
Yes.

4947
02:21:53.390 --> 02:21:54.470
Funny how he barely even,

4948
02:21:54.530 --> 02:21:55.450
I don't think you noticed the,

4949
02:21:55.451 --> 02:21:56.720
until the wheels.

4950
02:21:56.850 --> 02:21:57.440
Yeah.

4951
02:21:57.440 --> 02:21:58.221
Who's doing cartwheels?

4952
02:21:58.221 --> 02:21:59.290
We're fucked up toe.

4953
02:21:59.350 --> 02:22:00.110
And you were like,

4954
02:22:00.110 --> 02:22:00.440
Hey,

4955
02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:01.120
look at your food.

4956
02:22:01.120 --> 02:22:01.240
No,

4957
02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:01.331
no,

4958
02:22:01.331 --> 02:22:01.670
no.

4959
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:02.480
He noticed it.

4960
02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:02.601
Oh,

4961
02:22:02.601 --> 02:22:03.060
he not?

4962
02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:03.321
Yeah.

4963
02:22:03.321 --> 02:22:05.930
We were talking and he was like standing like he,

4964
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:09.380
I think he noticed that when he's stepping and who's stepping in something wet,

4965
02:22:09.630 --> 02:22:10.540
so he looked down,

4966
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:11.311
I realized it was blood.

4967
02:22:11.311 --> 02:22:11.601
It's like,

4968
02:22:11.601 --> 02:22:12.434
where's this blood?

4969
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:13.940
Oh my goodness.

4970
02:22:13.941 --> 02:22:15.050
I have a broken toe.

4971
02:22:15.350 --> 02:22:16.890
That's when he realized there was something wrong.

4972
02:22:16.990 --> 02:22:17.630
Right.

4973
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:18.770
It was totally him.

4974
02:22:18.860 --> 02:22:20.000
Him looking down at it.

4975
02:22:20.330 --> 02:22:21.000
Yeah.

4976
02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:21.950
It was fucking crazy.

4977
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:25.370
It was a crazy moment because nobody knew what to do because I was interviewing

4978
02:22:25.371 --> 02:22:26.161
him and it was all antique,

4979
02:22:26.161 --> 02:22:27.030
so nobody acted,

4980
02:22:27.031 --> 02:22:28.950
so I had to kind of like grabbed the stool,

4981
02:22:28.980 --> 02:22:30.090
calling the doctor,

4982
02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:31.500
sit down and you still want to do this.

4983
02:22:31.501 --> 02:22:31.890
It's like,

4984
02:22:31.890 --> 02:22:32.551
I just want to talk.

4985
02:22:32.551 --> 02:22:32.791
I'm like,

4986
02:22:32.791 --> 02:22:33.540
okay.

4987
02:22:33.540 --> 02:22:34.410
It was a weird moment.

4988
02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:36.630
I know you have to tell somebody to get a chair for him.

4989
02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:36.841
Well,

4990
02:22:36.841 --> 02:22:37.740
I got a chair for him.

4991
02:22:37.780 --> 02:22:39.210
I wound up getting the chair myself.

4992
02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:39.871
I was like,

4993
02:22:39.871 --> 02:22:40.710
can we get him a chair?

4994
02:22:40.711 --> 02:22:41.101
And then I'm like,

4995
02:22:41.101 --> 02:22:41.850
no one's moving.

4996
02:22:41.850 --> 02:22:42.041
Right.

4997
02:22:42.041 --> 02:22:42.840
Like everybody was like,

4998
02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:43.673
Oh shit.

4999
02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:44.581
You know?

5000
02:22:44.581 --> 02:22:47.010
No one wanted to get in the way on TV either.

5001
02:22:47.011 --> 02:22:47.261
You know?

5002
02:22:47.261 --> 02:22:49.470
It's one of those things you're probably,

5003
02:22:49.471 --> 02:22:52.590
it's probably like strict rules as to who can enter the octagon and that

5004
02:22:52.591 --> 02:22:53.221
situation,

5005
02:22:53.221 --> 02:22:53.521
you know,

5006
02:22:53.521 --> 02:22:53.741
you have.

5007
02:22:53.741 --> 02:22:54.574
Right.

5008
02:22:54.600 --> 02:22:55.650
But that,

5009
02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:58.800
that was probably one of the weirdest injuries that I've ever seen.

5010
02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:59.040
Where,

5011
02:22:59.040 --> 02:22:59.430
who,

5012
02:22:59.430 --> 02:23:00.263
who saw that comment?

5013
02:23:00.510 --> 02:23:01.081
Some guy up,

5014
02:23:01.081 --> 02:23:02.730
you hurt your own self and yeah,

5015
02:23:02.731 --> 02:23:04.440
you are this close to losing the fight.

5016
02:23:04.441 --> 02:23:05.460
When you have dominated the,

5017
02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:06.300
he would've lost,

5018
02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:10.050
they would have taped that fucking foot together would have gone if they could,

5019
02:23:10.330 --> 02:23:11.163
if they,

5020
02:23:11.250 --> 02:23:12.840
even if he didn't have to tape it together,

5021
02:23:13.330 --> 02:23:16.440
chair would have had to come close enough to clinch him and he'd beat you up so

5022
02:23:16.441 --> 02:23:19.680
bad on that first round chair was in a lot of trouble doing anything in that

5023
02:23:19.681 --> 02:23:20.280
second round.

5024
02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:20.730
Yeah.

5025
02:23:20.730 --> 02:23:20.911
I mean,

5026
02:23:20.911 --> 02:23:22.170
the fight was almost over.

5027
02:23:22.171 --> 02:23:23.370
The round was almost over.

5028
02:23:23.371 --> 02:23:24.870
I think there was like 30 seconds to go,

5029
02:23:24.871 --> 02:23:25.704
maybe less.

5030
02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:29.280
But beating that he put on shale was ferocious.

5031
02:23:29.281 --> 02:23:29.580
Man.

5032
02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:30.570
Those elbows,

5033
02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:32.040
he's a motherfucker,

5034
02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:32.940
man.

5035
02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:34.830
He's a motherfucker and he's getting better all the time.

5036
02:23:35.430 --> 02:23:36.780
It's so cool to watch.

5037
02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:37.320
Uh,

5038
02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:42.320
what is like a real exceptional athlete as exceptionally gifted person come

5039
02:23:43.711 --> 02:23:44.940
along in MMA.

5040
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.360
Yup.

5041
02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:45.721
You know,

5042
02:23:45.721 --> 02:23:50.400
cause he to me is like a Roy Jones Jr type character.

5043
02:23:50.460 --> 02:23:55.460
Like a guy who's coming out of nowhere who's just so athletically talented as

5044
02:23:56.191 --> 02:24:00.370
well as all the other things as well as disciplined as well as he's got it.

5045
02:24:00.390 --> 02:24:02.400
He's got the whole package and he's creative.

5046
02:24:02.401 --> 02:24:03.234
He's fun to watch.

5047
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:06.440
It's just not going to do address the same fucking thing that he does well.

5048
02:24:06.441 --> 02:24:07.620
And he wins by whatever.

5049
02:24:07.650 --> 02:24:10.680
He actually pulled self these crazy moves that you never know what he's going to

5050
02:24:10.681 --> 02:24:10.920
do.

5051
02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:12.780
And it's like that's spinning elbow.

5052
02:24:12.781 --> 02:24:14.220
He does when he gets you up against the cage,

5053
02:24:14.250 --> 02:24:16.200
it's like a tornado of bones.

5054
02:24:16.410 --> 02:24:16.650
It's,

5055
02:24:16.650 --> 02:24:17.483
it's

5056
02:24:18.470 --> 02:24:21.190
just getting smashed that just,

5057
02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:22.860
and you know,

5058
02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:24.150
it's amazing.

5059
02:24:24.151 --> 02:24:26.370
The kids are only like 25 like what the fuck?

5060
02:24:26.371 --> 02:24:26.610
What,

5061
02:24:26.610 --> 02:24:27.220
how,

5062
02:24:27.220 --> 02:24:27.811
what's it gonna be like?

5063
02:24:27.811 --> 02:24:28.680
And he's 35.

5064
02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:29.761
Yeah.

5065
02:24:29.761 --> 02:24:31.230
Cause he's not really taking damage.

5066
02:24:31.231 --> 02:24:33.180
So these are 80 can go on forever.

5067
02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:34.170
Yeah.

5068
02:24:34.170 --> 02:24:35.600
How's it going to take damage?

5069
02:24:35.601 --> 02:24:35.881
She was like,

5070
02:24:35.881 --> 02:24:37.860
who is going to be able to solve that fucking puzzle?

5071
02:24:38.270 --> 02:24:38.970
Like what?

5072
02:24:38.970 --> 02:24:39.690
What is,

5073
02:24:39.690 --> 02:24:39.901
you know,

5074
02:24:39.901 --> 02:24:41.520
sometimes you look at a guy's style and it's like,

5075
02:24:41.580 --> 02:24:41.910
hmm.

5076
02:24:41.910 --> 02:24:43.050
You know what that Guy Needs?

5077
02:24:43.051 --> 02:24:46.260
If you find a guy who does this and that he might be in trouble.

5078
02:24:46.770 --> 02:24:49.380
The closest is if Vito Belfort catched him in an arm bar.

5079
02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:49.831
Yeah.

5080
02:24:49.831 --> 02:24:53.610
But I mean that's sure everybody comes into was one mistake happens.

5081
02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:54.270
Anybody couldn't.

5082
02:24:54.270 --> 02:24:56.980
There's always that percentage where you'll Kennedy was any fight no matter

5083
02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:57.330
what.

5084
02:24:57.330 --> 02:24:57.841
But he's like,

5085
02:24:57.841 --> 02:24:59.220
the outs are so low.

5086
02:24:59.340 --> 02:24:59.610
Right.

5087
02:24:59.610 --> 02:25:00.270
And you know what,

5088
02:25:00.270 --> 02:25:00.501
what,

5089
02:25:00.501 --> 02:25:02.040
what freaks me out about that arm bar?

5090
02:25:02.490 --> 02:25:03.860
He left that to fuck his hormone.

5091
02:25:03.890 --> 02:25:04.290
Yeah.

5092
02:25:04.290 --> 02:25:07.530
He left that dude way hyper extend his arm and he never tapped.

5093
02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:07.920
Nope.

5094
02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:08.790
He did not tap.

5095
02:25:08.791 --> 02:25:10.350
And then he'd beat him up and then he tapped him.

5096
02:25:10.710 --> 02:25:12.150
He tapped him with the fuck dot bomb.

5097
02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:12.810
It's like,

5098
02:25:12.810 --> 02:25:16.170
so he's got this mental game down as well?

5099
02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:16.801
Yeah.

5100
02:25:16.801 --> 02:25:19.640
Cause it's like he got the siren puppy in the first round and then he wasn't

5101
02:25:19.660 --> 02:25:20.461
watching the fort.

5102
02:25:20.461 --> 02:25:20.971
So he's like,

5103
02:25:20.971 --> 02:25:21.601
he's not even like,

5104
02:25:21.601 --> 02:25:22.920
he walked right away and Dan,

5105
02:25:22.921 --> 02:25:23.590
he was like,

5106
02:25:23.590 --> 02:25:23.980
could pay

5107
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:27.880
<v 2>attention to this nasty armbar to veto or did that,</v>

5108
02:25:27.881 --> 02:25:29.320
that was some real black belts.

5109
02:25:29.321 --> 02:25:29.591
Shit.

5110
02:25:29.591 --> 02:25:30.190
Perfect.

5111
02:25:30.190 --> 02:25:30.690
Yeah,

5112
02:25:30.690 --> 02:25:31.090
no,

5113
02:25:31.090 --> 02:25:31.510
that's,

5114
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:32.343
oof.

5115
02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:33.550
Most guys would have tapped.

5116
02:25:33.610 --> 02:25:35.860
I would have tapped like,

5117
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:37.200
how do you feel if you are a bad for it,

5118
02:25:37.210 --> 02:25:38.710
you pull it off the perfect move.

5119
02:25:39.390 --> 02:25:40.230
Papa disarm.

5120
02:25:40.350 --> 02:25:41.260
You got to Ronda Rousey.

5121
02:25:41.261 --> 02:25:41.830
I bitch,

5122
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:42.730
you got to Ronda Rousey.

5123
02:25:42.770 --> 02:25:43.690
Ronda breaks arms.

5124
02:25:43.691 --> 02:25:44.740
She doesn't wait for you to tap.

5125
02:25:44.770 --> 02:25:45.130
Yup.

5126
02:25:45.130 --> 02:25:47.980
She's not even trying to get you to taps is trying to break your shit.

5127
02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:49.690
Her mentality is not the ta.

5128
02:25:49.770 --> 02:25:53.590
You'll tap and then when her mentality is break it right and then they got a

5129
02:25:53.591 --> 02:25:53.980
tap,

5130
02:25:53.980 --> 02:25:55.030
then the game's over.

5131
02:25:55.090 --> 02:25:55.923
Yup.

5132
02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:56.321
Yeah.

5133
02:25:56.321 --> 02:25:56.620
That's what,

5134
02:25:56.620 --> 02:25:59.480
what a crazy way to make 11 he says,

5135
02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:01.060
so your podcast,

5136
02:26:01.061 --> 02:26:02.770
you call your podcasts drunk and doused.

5137
02:26:02.830 --> 02:26:03.570
Yup.

5138
02:26:03.570 --> 02:26:03.900
You,

5139
02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:04.733
you're fairly sober

5140
02:26:06.250 --> 02:26:07.083
sometimes.

5141
02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:08.680
Why do you call it drunk in Dallas?

5142
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:11.910
I like wine and I liked that.

5143
02:26:11.940 --> 02:26:12.210
Always.

5144
02:26:12.210 --> 02:26:12.431
No,

5145
02:26:12.431 --> 02:26:12.791
I guess,

5146
02:26:12.791 --> 02:26:14.080
I mean to me it's like a,

5147
02:26:14.081 --> 02:26:17.110
there's always things like Kung Fu movies or something to figure off the old

5148
02:26:17.111 --> 02:26:21.460
dude who looks like all drunk and stuff and he can fix it off these amazing

5149
02:26:21.461 --> 02:26:21.780
seeing.

5150
02:26:21.780 --> 02:26:23.110
It's like how the fuck did that happen?

5151
02:26:23.530 --> 02:26:26.020
I dig the idea of figuring out our ways,

5152
02:26:26.021 --> 02:26:27.490
whether it's applied to martial arts,

5153
02:26:27.530 --> 02:26:31.660
we were up light to life to nobody can figure out how you did it,

5154
02:26:31.810 --> 02:26:32.770
but you pull it off.

5155
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:33.250
Right.

5156
02:26:33.250 --> 02:26:37.720
And to not think along the same lines like everybody else is going through the

5157
02:26:37.721 --> 02:26:38.121
plan.

5158
02:26:38.121 --> 02:26:39.080
There's an obvious eight,

5159
02:26:39.081 --> 02:26:39.461
two B,

5160
02:26:39.461 --> 02:26:40.900
B two C to get the results,

5161
02:26:40.901 --> 02:26:43.180
but to have an alternate way to get shit done.

5162
02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:44.350
I like it.

5163
02:26:44.350 --> 02:26:46.740
So that's why he came up with drunken Dallas again.

5164
02:26:46.810 --> 02:26:48.040
That's the high mind.

5165
02:26:48.041 --> 02:26:50.230
That verse from the low minded version is I liked that way.

5166
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.550
He's a man.

5167
02:26:50.550 --> 02:26:51.190
I like wine.

5168
02:26:51.190 --> 02:26:52.330
Did you draw this,

5169
02:26:52.331 --> 02:26:53.950
this picture that's on your tee shirt?

5170
02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:54.160
No.

5171
02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:54.731
I ask,

5172
02:26:54.731 --> 02:26:55.150
uh,

5173
02:26:55.150 --> 02:26:56.400
I ask a desired taste.

5174
02:26:56.410 --> 02:26:59.920
I told her what I wanted and she worked with me a little.

5175
02:26:59.921 --> 02:27:00.731
She was really cool.

5176
02:27:00.731 --> 02:27:05.731
She was also so what is it is a dude punching a guy who's getting kissed?

5177
02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:06.191
Yeah.

5178
02:27:06.191 --> 02:27:10.540
There's this guy who was making out with this heart Shipley woman while he's

5179
02:27:10.541 --> 02:27:14.160
making out with their chair you sporting wine over the two of them as they're

5180
02:27:14.170 --> 02:27:18.810
another guy punches him and other guys punching him while he's leaning backward,

5181
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:19.690
kissing the woman.

5182
02:27:19.691 --> 02:27:24.010
He managed to use a leg to kick him in the balls so it's like that is one of the

5183
02:27:24.011 --> 02:27:27.460
worst shirts have ever seen in my life and you need to burn it and never wear it

5184
02:27:27.461 --> 02:27:29.320
again and you need a question.

5185
02:27:29.321 --> 02:27:32.410
Your sanity for mass producing these fucking things.

5186
02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:33.253
You love it.

5187
02:27:33.730 --> 02:27:34.563
I love it.

5188
02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:36.790
It's so multidimensional.

5189
02:27:36.820 --> 02:27:37.390
Yeah,

5190
02:27:37.390 --> 02:27:38.050
it's a,

5191
02:27:38.050 --> 02:27:39.160
I'm a lover and the fight,

5192
02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:41.160
it's a very strange shirt dude.

5193
02:27:41.161 --> 02:27:45.750
You sending a really confusing message and you're also a cartoonist or you

5194
02:27:45.751 --> 02:27:47.890
should have like a drunk in Dallas Adventures.

5195
02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:50.640
This guy just running around drinking and making out with chicks and kicking

5196
02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:52.060
random bullies in the balls.

5197
02:27:52.090 --> 02:27:53.470
That's not a bad plan.

5198
02:27:54.220 --> 02:27:56.380
You've only been in America short amount of time folks.

5199
02:27:56.381 --> 02:27:56.950
We need to,

5200
02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:58.060
we need a season him.

5201
02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:02.320
We needed to get Danieli Bolelli just accustomed to our way of life or this is

5202
02:28:02.321 --> 02:28:07.321
ridiculous and we don't allow you to the other interpretation people,

5203
02:28:07.421 --> 02:28:07.781
they're like,

5204
02:28:07.781 --> 02:28:10.420
no but wait this dude duties punching game and he's leaning back.

5205
02:28:10.421 --> 02:28:11.530
I'm like well in that case,

5206
02:28:11.531 --> 02:28:15.190
if he's still managed to Macau with a woman and drink after getting patch,

5207
02:28:15.490 --> 02:28:15.891
I dig it.

5208
02:28:15.891 --> 02:28:16.724
That message too.

5209
02:28:16.930 --> 02:28:20.680
I would think he really needs to stop being cocky and let go of the girl and

5210
02:28:20.681 --> 02:28:22.280
deal with dude is trying to kick his ass.

5211
02:28:22.310 --> 02:28:23.420
Cause this is silly.

5212
02:28:23.421 --> 02:28:23.691
I've,

5213
02:28:23.691 --> 02:28:23.801
I've,

5214
02:28:23.801 --> 02:28:24.321
I was your coach.

5215
02:28:24.321 --> 02:28:25.190
I'll be very mad at you.

5216
02:28:25.750 --> 02:28:26.950
Not really a,

5217
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:28.550
you got to address the situation.

5218
02:28:31.330 --> 02:28:32.090
Um,

5219
02:28:32.090 --> 02:28:32.901
what do you,

5220
02:28:32.901 --> 02:28:33.050
uh,

5221
02:28:33.050 --> 02:28:34.490
how often are you doing your podcast?

5222
02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:35.570
I do twice a month.

5223
02:28:35.571 --> 02:28:40.571
They do once a month with a guest and then once a month is like random rants and

5224
02:28:40.821 --> 02:28:45.440
chat with my friends or each and Devon were helping me put together.

5225
02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:46.490
You do it out of your house?

5226
02:28:46.730 --> 02:28:46.941
No,

5227
02:28:46.941 --> 02:28:47.600
we recorded,

5228
02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:50.090
well actually we started doing a few at my house.

5229
02:28:50.091 --> 02:28:52.760
We were doing it in a studio first and then now we,

5230
02:28:52.761 --> 02:28:53.570
um,

5231
02:28:53.570 --> 02:28:55.060
we decided to move the ball,

5232
02:28:55.061 --> 02:28:56.090
the studios for a few times.

5233
02:28:56.091 --> 02:28:57.470
We did it in my house was cool.

5234
02:28:57.800 --> 02:28:58.041
Yeah.

5235
02:28:58.041 --> 02:29:00.350
It's cool to be able to do it wherever the fuck you want it.

5236
02:29:00.351 --> 02:29:00.860
Right?

5237
02:29:00.860 --> 02:29:01.250
Yeah.

5238
02:29:01.250 --> 02:29:02.083
Yeah,

5239
02:29:02.390 --> 02:29:02.571
yeah.

5240
02:29:02.571 --> 02:29:02.731
It's,

5241
02:29:02.731 --> 02:29:04.100
it's cool to have a central location,

5242
02:29:04.101 --> 02:29:04.301
but I,

5243
02:29:04.301 --> 02:29:05.031
I like when,

5244
02:29:05.031 --> 02:29:05.360
uh,

5245
02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:08.510
sometimes when people do like already does a lot of them on the road and just

5246
02:29:08.511 --> 02:29:08.901
starts,

5247
02:29:08.901 --> 02:29:09.734
uh,

5248
02:29:09.850 --> 02:29:10.130
you know,

5249
02:29:10.130 --> 02:29:10.461
brings,

5250
02:29:10.461 --> 02:29:10.610
it,

5251
02:29:10.610 --> 02:29:13.970
brings microphone sets up and that way if he's in weird places,

5252
02:29:13.971 --> 02:29:15.440
he can get strange people.

5253
02:29:15.441 --> 02:29:16.010
Right.

5254
02:29:16.010 --> 02:29:17.810
It's gone or he's gone.

5255
02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:19.220
I moved to New York City.

5256
02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:20.293
It did,

5257
02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:24.200
cause he's a silly bitch and he's all Jude out I think.

5258
02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:25.580
So you can go to the motherland,

5259
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:27.200
you can't go to Israel.

5260
02:29:27.230 --> 02:29:29.930
So he thinks he's just going to go to New York and that's the other junior

5261
02:29:29.931 --> 02:29:30.764
motherland.

5262
02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:33.590
They're going to accept him with open open sandwiches.

5263
02:29:33.690 --> 02:29:38.000
<v 3>We had a going away podcast where he brought this huge box and inside the box</v>

5264
02:29:38.001 --> 02:29:39.630
it's just shit that he was going to throw away.

5265
02:29:39.690 --> 02:29:40.321
And he's like,

5266
02:29:40.321 --> 02:29:40.740
you know,

5267
02:29:40.740 --> 02:29:43.920
if you come to the show or may get give away presents the whole night.

5268
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:47.640
He had like all this random shit that he like bought when he was really stoned

5269
02:29:47.641 --> 02:29:49.710
and never used or never even opened the boxes.

5270
02:29:49.711 --> 02:29:50.310
It's like,

5271
02:29:50.310 --> 02:29:51.143
you know,

5272
02:29:51.330 --> 02:29:53.610
random things like raid air bombs,

5273
02:29:53.611 --> 02:29:53.851
you know,

5274
02:29:53.851 --> 02:29:56.730
for cockroaches and like just weird shit.

5275
02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:57.870
And then at one point he's like,

5276
02:29:57.900 --> 02:29:58.171
all right,

5277
02:29:58.171 --> 02:29:58.740
who here?

5278
02:29:58.740 --> 02:29:59.140
You know,

5279
02:29:59.140 --> 02:30:01.620
the next five people who here does drugs,

5280
02:30:01.621 --> 02:30:01.860
you know,

5281
02:30:01.860 --> 02:30:02.610
raise your hand.

5282
02:30:02.610 --> 02:30:05.040
And he's just throwing out prescription medicine to people.

5283
02:30:05.340 --> 02:30:06.120
It's fucking like,

5284
02:30:06.120 --> 02:30:07.020
he grabs this one thing,

5285
02:30:07.021 --> 02:30:07.380
he goes,

5286
02:30:07.380 --> 02:30:07.561
oh,

5287
02:30:07.561 --> 02:30:08.400
he better not do that.

5288
02:30:08.430 --> 02:30:08.581
Like,

5289
02:30:08.581 --> 02:30:10.710
cause I think it was like acid or something.

5290
02:30:10.711 --> 02:30:11.820
He just puts it in his pocket.

5291
02:30:12.390 --> 02:30:13.530
But it was just ridiculous.

5292
02:30:13.620 --> 02:30:14.470
And then he hands up,

5293
02:30:14.490 --> 02:30:19.050
he opens like this thing of joints and he gives a joint to every single person

5294
02:30:19.051 --> 02:30:19.884
in the audience.

5295
02:30:20.100 --> 02:30:20.841
And then he's like,

5296
02:30:20.841 --> 02:30:25.710
people in the audience probably like 30 40 something like that and get 40 joints

5297
02:30:25.711 --> 02:30:25.890
way.

5298
02:30:25.890 --> 02:30:26.450
So yeah.

5299
02:30:26.450 --> 02:30:26.820
Oh yeah.

5300
02:30:26.820 --> 02:30:27.451
He gave a lie.

5301
02:30:27.451 --> 02:30:28.920
I mean it was just a huge thing of joints.

5302
02:30:29.150 --> 02:30:29.330
And,

5303
02:30:29.330 --> 02:30:30.490
and he's just like [inaudible] over boaters,

5304
02:30:30.500 --> 02:30:35.500
smoker and so we s everyone's smoking it and just in the comedy so you can't

5305
02:30:35.821 --> 02:30:37.140
even see anything.

5306
02:30:37.500 --> 02:30:39.360
And then there's like this Boston uh,

5307
02:30:39.570 --> 02:30:41.760
you know thing going on downstairs for like all the,

5308
02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:43.640
like a tribute or a,

5309
02:30:43.641 --> 02:30:44.474
a marathon,

5310
02:30:44.640 --> 02:30:48.240
a show where they're making the raising money for charity show.

5311
02:30:48.330 --> 02:30:52.260
There's this charity show going on and you just sing the smoke just gushing down

5312
02:30:52.261 --> 02:30:55.710
that back hallway like going into that was in the main room,

5313
02:30:55.711 --> 02:30:56.760
which is right below,

5314
02:30:56.820 --> 02:30:59.050
right below the La early room.

5315
02:30:59.460 --> 02:30:59.610
That's

5316
02:30:59.610 --> 02:31:00.241
<v 2>hilarious.</v>

5317
02:31:00.241 --> 02:31:01.074
So funny though.

5318
02:31:01.350 --> 02:31:02.220
That's ridiculous.

5319
02:31:03.260 --> 02:31:03.611
Yeah.

5320
02:31:03.611 --> 02:31:05.280
You mean literally burned his bridge?

5321
02:31:05.940 --> 02:31:06.773
Exactly.

5322
02:31:07.800 --> 02:31:07.951
Yeah.

5323
02:31:07.951 --> 02:31:09.120
You can't do that indoors.

5324
02:31:09.130 --> 02:31:09.280
He,

5325
02:31:09.280 --> 02:31:11.820
they can lose their license for that show and that's supposed to do that.

5326
02:31:11.821 --> 02:31:14.070
You fuck allegedly that all happened.

5327
02:31:14.100 --> 02:31:14.281
Yeah,

5328
02:31:14.281 --> 02:31:16.320
allegedly because the people were smoking in the audience.

5329
02:31:16.590 --> 02:31:19.800
I think you used to be able to smoke on stage a part of an ass.

5330
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:20.120
Our

5331
02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:21.220
<v 1>artistic performance.</v>

5332
02:31:21.221 --> 02:31:21.910
You can still do that.

5333
02:31:21.910 --> 02:31:23.860
I still do that because Stan hope used to do it.

5334
02:31:24.250 --> 02:31:27.160
He's just smoke on stage and make fun of how it was a part of artistic

5335
02:31:27.161 --> 02:31:27.994
performance.

5336
02:31:28.210 --> 02:31:29.440
You're allowed to smoke on stage.

5337
02:31:29.740 --> 02:31:30.910
Some stupid loophole.

5338
02:31:31.500 --> 02:31:31.980
<v 3>Yup.</v>

5339
02:31:31.980 --> 02:31:32.521
I remember that.

5340
02:31:32.521 --> 02:31:32.611
He,

5341
02:31:32.611 --> 02:31:34.740
cause he smoked a in Ohio,

5342
02:31:34.741 --> 02:31:38.490
he went and played this like a building that's owned by the campus.

5343
02:31:38.520 --> 02:31:42.120
It's just like a building for speech and you know speakers and stuff like that.

5344
02:31:42.121 --> 02:31:43.320
But it had a bar in it.

5345
02:31:43.321 --> 02:31:45.360
It was really weird and I think they tore it down since then.

5346
02:31:45.530 --> 02:31:49.890
Ohio state and Doug played and he wanted to smoke so bad but this is like owned

5347
02:31:49.891 --> 02:31:52.950
by the school and there's like definitely no smoking allowed in it.

5348
02:31:53.230 --> 02:31:53.501
And he goes,

5349
02:31:53.501 --> 02:31:54.061
well I don't care,

5350
02:31:54.061 --> 02:31:54.900
everyone can smoke.

5351
02:31:54.901 --> 02:31:58.110
And he just starts looking like the bartender lady who was just like this older

5352
02:31:58.111 --> 02:31:58.651
lady that,

5353
02:31:58.651 --> 02:31:59.230
you know,

5354
02:31:59.230 --> 02:32:00.650
it probably was a retired and you just,

5355
02:32:00.780 --> 02:32:03.660
I work at the old college but she was like,

5356
02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:05.310
Oh stop it please.

5357
02:32:05.311 --> 02:32:06.560
And she was just kidding up sex.

5358
02:32:06.561 --> 02:32:07.321
He didn't have to do.

5359
02:32:07.321 --> 02:32:10.260
And the whole campus was just like cigarettes.

5360
02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:12.100
Everyone was smoking cigarettes on ignite.

5361
02:32:12.210 --> 02:32:13.800
Little in that little room.

5362
02:32:13.801 --> 02:32:15.580
And I leaned over and helped did it on stage.

5363
02:32:16.290 --> 02:32:17.180
So when they allowed,

5364
02:32:17.181 --> 02:32:17.900
just tell him to stop

5365
02:32:17.900 --> 02:32:18.860
<v 1>doing onstage there.</v>

5366
02:32:18.861 --> 02:32:19.391
Was it a,

5367
02:32:19.391 --> 02:32:21.290
an artistic performance thing?

5368
02:32:21.780 --> 02:32:22.270
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

5369
02:32:22.270 --> 02:32:23.071
He did it anyway.

5370
02:32:23.071 --> 02:32:23.904
He just didn't care.

5371
02:32:24.180 --> 02:32:25.470
It's what everyone in the audience to do it.

5372
02:32:25.471 --> 02:32:25.930
Awesome

5373
02:32:25.930 --> 02:32:28.350
<v 1>problem with six cigarettes is it fucks with other people.</v>

5374
02:32:28.410 --> 02:32:28.980
You know,

5375
02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:31.860
that's the problem with that stinky drug and it doesn't,

5376
02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:34.590
that's the one thing that Stan hope says that if he could stop,

5377
02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:37.680
he did this opening Anthony thing recently where they were talking about

5378
02:32:37.681 --> 02:32:38.461
addiction because you know,

5379
02:32:38.461 --> 02:32:40.430
Jim Norton is like real clean and um,

5380
02:32:40.920 --> 02:32:42.570
and it made some news source.

5381
02:32:42.630 --> 02:32:42.811
It was,

5382
02:32:42.811 --> 02:32:44.310
cause it was an interesting conversation.

5383
02:32:44.340 --> 02:32:45.990
We're standing up was advocating that,

5384
02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:46.471
you know,

5385
02:32:46.471 --> 02:32:49.280
he's a shitty comic if he's not drunk and uh,

5386
02:32:49.290 --> 02:32:53.220
that's why he stays drunk and that comics like Mitch Hedberg,

5387
02:32:53.221 --> 02:32:55.610
the only way you would have gotten those guys with the drugs,

5388
02:32:55.630 --> 02:32:56.341
hunter s Thompson,

5389
02:32:56.341 --> 02:32:58.470
the only way you would've got him as with the drugs and the alcohol,

5390
02:32:58.540 --> 02:33:00.390
that's how you create something like that.

5391
02:33:01.050 --> 02:33:01.710
You know,

5392
02:33:01.710 --> 02:33:02.221
it's just a,

5393
02:33:02.221 --> 02:33:02.731
you know,

5394
02:33:02.731 --> 02:33:05.250
a weird sort of conversation to get into with people.

5395
02:33:05.340 --> 02:33:07.950
But he said the one thing that he regrets is the cigarettes.

5396
02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:08.770
Yeah.

5397
02:33:08.770 --> 02:33:11.580
He said it doesn't give you any benefit in these completely hooked on him.

5398
02:33:11.700 --> 02:33:12.533
Right.

5399
02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:14.640
But they say that does give you a benefit,

5400
02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:15.991
like synapsis,

5401
02:33:15.991 --> 02:33:18.780
like Stephen King claims that when he stopped smoking,

5402
02:33:18.781 --> 02:33:22.820
then he noticed a difference in his ability to fire that.

5403
02:33:22.830 --> 02:33:24.750
Like his mind fired slower.

5404
02:33:24.930 --> 02:33:27.650
These was just the right after he stopped or like why?

5405
02:33:27.810 --> 02:33:28.231
I don't know.

5406
02:33:28.231 --> 02:33:28.650
He just,

5407
02:33:28.650 --> 02:33:29.700
he made a comment on it.

5408
02:33:29.950 --> 02:33:31.020
I don't think it's right after.

5409
02:33:31.021 --> 02:33:32.460
I think it's the effect of it,

5410
02:33:32.490 --> 02:33:33.323
I think.

5411
02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:36.070
I think when people are on nicotine all the time,

5412
02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:37.710
nicotine is like some kind of a stimulant.

5413
02:33:37.870 --> 02:33:38.460
Yeah.

5414
02:33:38.460 --> 02:33:39.293
It relaxes.

5415
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:40.040
<v 3>I tell you,</v>

5416
02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:41.320
it wasn't really relaxed.

5417
02:33:41.321 --> 02:33:42.154
That's sort of sort of a,

5418
02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:42.281
Oh,

5419
02:33:42.281 --> 02:33:42.860
it does.

5420
02:33:42.860 --> 02:33:44.350
It relaxes your nerves and everything.

5421
02:33:44.680 --> 02:33:47.710
<v 1>But the reason why it relaxes it because it feeds your addiction.</v>

5422
02:33:47.970 --> 02:33:48.850
That's that overlap.

5423
02:33:49.430 --> 02:33:49.830
Yeah.

5424
02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:50.663
That's absolutely.

5425
02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:51.170
No,

5426
02:33:51.170 --> 02:33:51.760
no,

5427
02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:51.941
no.

5428
02:33:51.941 --> 02:33:53.350
That's what you,

5429
02:33:53.351 --> 02:33:55.960
when you get an addiction and you become a junkie,

5430
02:33:56.230 --> 02:33:56.711
you need it.

5431
02:33:56.711 --> 02:33:57.131
You need it,

5432
02:33:57.131 --> 02:33:57.491
you need it.

5433
02:33:57.491 --> 02:33:57.851
God Damn,

5434
02:33:57.851 --> 02:33:59.810
I'm stressed out of it and you didn't even need it.

5435
02:34:00.580 --> 02:34:01.413
Got It.

5436
02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:01.890
Well,

5437
02:34:01.890 --> 02:34:02.770
cigarettes relax me,

5438
02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:05.650
but they also got you to the point where you needed them where you were fucking

5439
02:34:05.651 --> 02:34:07.300
crazy and he looks,

5440
02:34:07.370 --> 02:34:07.830
it's like,

5441
02:34:07.830 --> 02:34:09.140
but it is a stimulant meaning,

5442
02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:11.150
but that's not a relaxing,

5443
02:34:11.170 --> 02:34:13.840
it's the exact opposite of something that relaxes you.

5444
02:34:13.900 --> 02:34:17.050
It's stimulant is the opposite of something that relaxes.

5445
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.943
Right?

5446
02:34:18.370 --> 02:34:18.911
Exactly.

5447
02:34:18.911 --> 02:34:20.470
That's why when you,

5448
02:34:20.471 --> 02:34:20.741
you're,

5449
02:34:20.741 --> 02:34:21.160
you're,

5450
02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:24.070
you definitely do get that feeling of relaxation,

5451
02:34:24.670 --> 02:34:27.700
but that feeling of relaxation is the same thing that heroin users get when they

5452
02:34:27.701 --> 02:34:28.210
shoot up.

5453
02:34:28.210 --> 02:34:29.043
Right?

5454
02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:30.213
Boom,

5455
02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:32.560
boom,

5456
02:34:32.590 --> 02:34:33.251
boom.

5457
02:34:33.251 --> 02:34:38.110
And they see those little white glowing butterflies float out of their soul.

5458
02:34:38.290 --> 02:34:41.650
I said laid back on the pillow and let go of the rubber band.

5459
02:34:42.410 --> 02:34:43.570
That's that hot heroin.

5460
02:34:43.571 --> 02:34:44.740
Just race through your body.

5461
02:34:46.670 --> 02:34:47.001
<v 5>Thank you.</v>

5462
02:34:47.001 --> 02:34:51.230
Jessica was about 17 people at least any right now to fall back into heroin.

5463
02:34:51.470 --> 02:34:52.120
The people

5464
02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:52.481
<v 1>done it,</v>

5465
02:34:52.481 --> 02:34:52.870
man.

5466
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:54.100
That's the problem with heroin.

5467
02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:54.641
Thanks.

5468
02:34:54.641 --> 02:34:56.170
Say it's fucking awesome.

5469
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.850
Yup.

5470
02:34:56.850 --> 02:34:58.990
People that have even take those pills.

5471
02:34:59.050 --> 02:34:59.980
I've said it's awesome.

5472
02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:01.173
Oxycontin,

5473
02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:03.460
oxycontin issues.

5474
02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:04.271
Yeah.

5475
02:35:04.271 --> 02:35:04.600
Some,

5476
02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:08.330
some guy posted a thread about it on a message board is talking about opiates,

5477
02:35:08.390 --> 02:35:09.340
how amazing they are.

5478
02:35:09.341 --> 02:35:12.380
It's just terrible that they're so bad for you that you can't carry a gun.

5479
02:35:12.381 --> 02:35:14.890
But the feeling apparently is just amazing.

5480
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:16.920
<v 5>I read somebody a awhile ago say now,</v>

5481
02:35:16.950 --> 02:35:19.820
yeah it's fucked up cause he mess you up or randos limits.

5482
02:35:19.821 --> 02:35:23.820
So we should leave it legal for people who have like a few months left to live

5483
02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:24.601
cause he's like,

5484
02:35:24.601 --> 02:35:25.790
what are they going to fuck up anyway?

5485
02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:26.011
You know,

5486
02:35:26.011 --> 02:35:26.910
you're dying anyway,

5487
02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:29.850
but you feel like a god for the last three months.

5488
02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:30.510
And uh,

5489
02:35:30.510 --> 02:35:31.231
I agree with that.

5490
02:35:31.231 --> 02:35:32.220
Well that's what we're doing anyway.

5491
02:35:32.221 --> 02:35:33.180
When we give him morphine,

5492
02:35:33.210 --> 02:35:33.871
that's what we're doing.

5493
02:35:33.871 --> 02:35:35.520
When we given them oxycontin's we're,

5494
02:35:35.521 --> 02:35:37.080
we're basically giving them opiates.

5495
02:35:37.081 --> 02:35:37.820
Right.

5496
02:35:37.820 --> 02:35:38.700
Mark Finney's is weird.

5497
02:35:38.701 --> 02:35:40.640
I mean when you think about that whole thing is like,

5498
02:35:40.641 --> 02:35:41.431
oh yeah.

5499
02:35:41.431 --> 02:35:42.330
Speaking of freedoms,

5500
02:35:42.380 --> 02:35:46.080
it's like people throw freedom except that you can't kill yourself the way you

5501
02:35:46.081 --> 02:35:46.501
want to.

5502
02:35:46.501 --> 02:35:46.711
You know,

5503
02:35:46.711 --> 02:35:46.871
she,

5504
02:35:46.871 --> 02:35:48.360
her dying is a little painful disease.

5505
02:35:48.361 --> 02:35:50.810
You need to die slowly and painfully because otherwise,

5506
02:35:50.820 --> 02:35:52.840
because otherwise are called angry.

5507
02:35:53.220 --> 02:35:53.821
Exactly.

5508
02:35:53.821 --> 02:35:55.080
It's like life is not,

5509
02:35:55.950 --> 02:35:57.540
you'll stay or leave,

5510
02:35:57.640 --> 02:35:58.110
but,

5511
02:35:58.110 --> 02:36:00.630
but then we have the hall space,

5512
02:36:00.690 --> 02:36:02.070
which he really,

5513
02:36:02.430 --> 02:36:05.130
I mean euthanasia is not legal so you can't really do it,

5514
02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:08.580
but we'll just give you a morphine for calm for wait,

5515
02:36:08.581 --> 02:36:09.920
you said do you need a mortar?

5516
02:36:09.921 --> 02:36:10.600
Marfino okay,

5517
02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:11.600
we'll give you a [inaudible].

5518
02:36:11.970 --> 02:36:13.620
You said you're still in pain,

5519
02:36:13.621 --> 02:36:13.890
you know,

5520
02:36:13.890 --> 02:36:16.140
of course you just got to keep shooting up until he dies,

5521
02:36:16.170 --> 02:36:17.670
but rather than doing it tonight,

5522
02:36:17.671 --> 02:36:18.690
you main cool the way.

5523
02:36:18.691 --> 02:36:19.750
Where did you shoot happen?

5524
02:36:19.751 --> 02:36:22.080
They are done in 50 minutes like you do with a dog.

5525
02:36:22.500 --> 02:36:25.470
You do it over a period of days or a week or something.

5526
02:36:25.471 --> 02:36:27.480
Just compare grandma to a dog.

5527
02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:32.430
So much goddamn crazy Italians.

5528
02:36:32.700 --> 02:36:34.560
But as thing is like people that are all a piece about,

5529
02:36:34.590 --> 02:36:35.251
ah,

5530
02:36:35.251 --> 02:36:35.851
it's terrible.

5531
02:36:35.851 --> 02:36:36.120
He's like,

5532
02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:38.130
well you don't fucking do it about that.

5533
02:36:38.180 --> 02:36:39.400
You would die the way you want to.

5534
02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:43.170
How about you let other people die is that someone can get it and then give it

5535
02:36:43.171 --> 02:36:44.004
to you.

5536
02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:44.933
That's the worry.

5537
02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:47.580
The worry about having shit that could fuck you up.

5538
02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:51.630
Obviously people doing it to people against their will or,

5539
02:36:51.810 --> 02:36:52.051
yeah,

5540
02:36:52.051 --> 02:36:53.220
that's of course,

5541
02:36:53.221 --> 02:36:54.460
but then that's what you work on,

5542
02:36:54.461 --> 02:36:56.490
on like anything that you don't do,

5543
02:36:56.491 --> 02:36:57.210
you know you're done.

5544
02:36:57.210 --> 02:37:00.280
[inaudible] Samsung just because it can be used against their wheel.

5545
02:37:00.300 --> 02:37:03.840
You work on the fact on those cases when it's used against somebody Swale,

5546
02:37:03.930 --> 02:37:07.560
which is the argument for not worrying about how many guns are out there but

5547
02:37:07.561 --> 02:37:10.800
worrying about the mental health of a nation and allows a certain percentage of

5548
02:37:10.801 --> 02:37:13.890
people go on gun fueled rampages right,

5549
02:37:13.891 --> 02:37:15.180
but who are those people?

5550
02:37:15.290 --> 02:37:16.070
Why are they doing

5551
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.370
<v 2>it?</v>

5552
02:37:16.370 --> 02:37:16.820
Exactly.

5553
02:37:16.820 --> 02:37:18.020
But nobody concentrates on that.

5554
02:37:18.021 --> 02:37:19.040
They concentrate on the guns.

5555
02:37:19.290 --> 02:37:20.840
There's too many guns.

5556
02:37:20.860 --> 02:37:21.693
Right.

5557
02:37:21.890 --> 02:37:22.250
It's like,

5558
02:37:22.250 --> 02:37:22.730
no,

5559
02:37:22.730 --> 02:37:23.421
that's exactly,

5560
02:37:23.421 --> 02:37:23.711
that's me.

5561
02:37:23.711 --> 02:37:24.920
Seemed to point cause it's about,

5562
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:29.950
it boils down to in your hand or well I don't know about y'all butts in

5563
02:37:30.201 --> 02:37:33.040
somebodies hand having a fucking atomic weapon.

5564
02:37:33.041 --> 02:37:35.540
It wouldn't be a problem because you're not nuts and they are not going to use

5565
02:37:35.541 --> 02:37:35.660
it.

5566
02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:37.330
Cause I would be a problem with it.

5567
02:37:38.990 --> 02:37:39.411
But,

5568
02:37:39.411 --> 02:37:39.980
uh,

5569
02:37:39.980 --> 02:37:43.070
but you know what I mean is like the worst thing and it really boils down to

5570
02:37:43.071 --> 02:37:44.150
individual to individual.

5571
02:37:44.151 --> 02:37:45.110
It's not the same thing.

5572
02:37:45.111 --> 02:37:48.860
The problem can seem because it's who's going to decide who's the same

5573
02:37:48.861 --> 02:37:50.210
individual and which one isn't.

5574
02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:50.481
You know,

5575
02:37:50.481 --> 02:37:53.000
the states we had that always works really well,

5576
02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:55.010
but then if you don't do it,

5577
02:37:55.011 --> 02:37:58.970
that means every cycle in the world can get easily their hands on some messed up

5578
02:37:58.971 --> 02:38:02.450
stuff if you do the way it is clearly an imperfect system because he's done

5579
02:38:02.451 --> 02:38:05.990
through the state where they're always enormous loophole sinks that doesn't

5580
02:38:05.991 --> 02:38:06.351
work,

5581
02:38:06.351 --> 02:38:07.010
isn't it a feature.

5582
02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:08.200
And so he's three.

5583
02:38:08.270 --> 02:38:12.020
I can see why people argue passionately both ways because you can see there's a

5584
02:38:12.021 --> 02:38:12.290
lot,

5585
02:38:12.290 --> 02:38:15.500
there's kind of a logic both ways in that yeah,

5586
02:38:15.501 --> 02:38:17.060
there's definitely a logic both ways.

5587
02:38:17.061 --> 02:38:21.530
I mean the idea that people are smart enough to figure out what to do and not to

5588
02:38:21.531 --> 02:38:21.861
do,

5589
02:38:21.861 --> 02:38:24.500
it's been proven false time and time again.

5590
02:38:24.530 --> 02:38:24.980
Yup.

5591
02:38:24.980 --> 02:38:27.290
People are stupid shit load of us.

5592
02:38:27.291 --> 02:38:28.190
They're stupid as fuck.

5593
02:38:28.370 --> 02:38:30.740
But then the argument is the reason why they're stupid as fuck.

5594
02:38:30.741 --> 02:38:34.700
Cause that we allow him to survive or being stupid and don't allow these dumb

5595
02:38:34.701 --> 02:38:35.740
mistakes to happen.

5596
02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:36.593
They die off.

5597
02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:40.250
We're just so attached to every single precious life that we're not allowed,

5598
02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:42.800
allowing stupid people that die from being stupid.

5599
02:38:42.970 --> 02:38:47.570
So stupidity is no longer a negative like factor.

5600
02:38:47.700 --> 02:38:48.070
Right.

5601
02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:53.070
And in evolution you're allowed to be stupid and live Super Fox.

5602
02:38:53.450 --> 02:38:54.320
That's fucking scary.

5603
02:38:54.321 --> 02:38:54.931
At the same time,

5604
02:38:54.931 --> 02:38:55.910
if it's fucking stupid.

5605
02:38:55.911 --> 02:38:56.744
So

5606
02:38:58.220 --> 02:39:00.050
it says [inaudible] is low from that too.

5607
02:39:00.051 --> 02:39:00.441
Like,

5608
02:39:00.441 --> 02:39:00.980
well,

5609
02:39:00.980 --> 02:39:03.850
go do eugenics program where we just set up something good.

5610
02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:05.210
It's,

5611
02:39:05.210 --> 02:39:06.110
you can't do that either.

5612
02:39:06.210 --> 02:39:06.830
Yeah.

5613
02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:07.011
Yeah.

5614
02:39:07.011 --> 02:39:08.630
That's a problem where there's no way to do it.

5615
02:39:08.631 --> 02:39:09.170
Right.

5616
02:39:09.170 --> 02:39:10.460
There's no way we're just,

5617
02:39:11.060 --> 02:39:12.480
we're stuck in the middle or just the,

5618
02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:16.670
we're on a stage of developing and one day we'll be way better than this,

5619
02:39:18.430 --> 02:39:20.120
but right now it's Kinda fucked.

5620
02:39:20.210 --> 02:39:21.080
Wait back there to me.

5621
02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:22.550
What the fuck?

5622
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:23.383
It's possible.

5623
02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:28.260
Even better than the god that is Daniela [inaudible] Jesus philosophy.

5624
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:30.740
The future is going to be amazing.

5625
02:39:30.741 --> 02:39:32.990
We'll have even better God's wow.

5626
02:39:33.230 --> 02:39:33.980
Um,

5627
02:39:33.980 --> 02:39:35.280
I don't know if I couldn't deal with that.

5628
02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:36.320
Are you still teaching?

5629
02:39:36.470 --> 02:39:36.860
Yeah.

5630
02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:37.693
Where are you teaching that?

5631
02:39:38.030 --> 02:39:40.220
I'm teaching a few courses across the long beach.

5632
02:39:40.221 --> 02:39:43.880
A few courses give you a hard time for your controversial viewpoints.

5633
02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:49.280
They decide these easier to just not deal with it because if they come after

5634
02:39:49.281 --> 02:39:49.641
you,

5635
02:39:49.641 --> 02:39:52.820
then you can open a show shit storm of why are you firing?

5636
02:39:52.821 --> 02:39:55.400
Gave him a note of that and you know what,

5637
02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:55.790
whatever,

5638
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:58.770
it doesn't matter anyway because we'll do things the way we want anyway.

5639
02:39:58.771 --> 02:40:01.280
Say whatever the fuck you want going into class to them.

5640
02:40:01.310 --> 02:40:05.750
Does anybody ever take umbrage with some of the things that you say?

5641
02:40:06.190 --> 02:40:06.920
Sure.

5642
02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:08.060
They do not,

5643
02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:09.530
not face to face.

5644
02:40:09.550 --> 02:40:10.383
Nobody says anything.

5645
02:40:10.690 --> 02:40:11.470
Well that's kind of cool.

5646
02:40:11.470 --> 02:40:11.870
Yeah.

5647
02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:14.130
So you teach all this crazy shit your classes and everybody's like,

5648
02:40:14.131 --> 02:40:15.810
well it's fucking historically accurate.

5649
02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:16.230
Yeah,

5650
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:17.160
I mean it's not,

5651
02:40:17.161 --> 02:40:17.994
um,

5652
02:40:18.030 --> 02:40:18.450
it's like,

5653
02:40:18.450 --> 02:40:18.840
sure,

5654
02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:21.750
I would do it to me about the specific event because I don't in the class,

5655
02:40:21.751 --> 02:40:24.000
I don't really try to sell a viewpoint.

5656
02:40:24.030 --> 02:40:25.980
So I'll say something really radical,

5657
02:40:25.981 --> 02:40:28.300
but I'll also show all the exception to what I just said.

5658
02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:28.800
Right.

5659
02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:31.920
So it doesn't sound like I'm trying to sell you something because the reason why

5660
02:40:31.921 --> 02:40:33.060
I asked you is because you,

5661
02:40:33.061 --> 02:40:35.370
you went on like some Twitter rampage awhile back,

5662
02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:36.460
but post based.

5663
02:40:36.680 --> 02:40:37.080
Yeah.

5664
02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:40.360
That was what you wrote like a whole essay about education system.

5665
02:40:40.390 --> 02:40:45.390
They had an open letter to academia that closes with the immortal words of

5666
02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:46.170
Tupac.

5667
02:40:46.170 --> 02:40:47.790
Fuck you and your motherfucking Mama.

5668
02:40:48.010 --> 02:40:49.510
So yes,

5669
02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:50.393
that I'm sure

5670
02:40:51.750 --> 02:40:53.010
that's how you make it count.

5671
02:40:53.820 --> 02:40:55.410
You got to speak their language.

5672
02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:56.273
Yeah.

5673
02:40:58.490 --> 02:40:59.191
Well man,

5674
02:40:59.191 --> 02:40:59.700
listen,

5675
02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:01.170
I wish I had a fucking teacher.

5676
02:41:01.171 --> 02:41:02.480
Like I had dom Irrera.

5677
02:41:02.481 --> 02:41:03.750
It used to be a teacher.

5678
02:41:03.751 --> 02:41:06.300
I wish he was one of my teachers and I wish you were one of my teachers too.

5679
02:41:06.570 --> 02:41:08.130
That would have been an amazing time when school.

5680
02:41:08.490 --> 02:41:12.240
Instead I got caught with a bunch of people that made teaching or made school

5681
02:41:12.241 --> 02:41:13.140
boring as fuck.

5682
02:41:13.290 --> 02:41:14.250
That's the majority.

5683
02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:16.950
I didn't know that history was interesting until I listen to Dan Carlin.

5684
02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:17.460
Yeah,

5685
02:41:17.460 --> 02:41:18.120
but that's what I mean.

5686
02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:19.170
That's what drives me insane.

5687
02:41:19.350 --> 02:41:22.650
A guy like Dan Carlin was fucking amazing in case we haven't made that clear

5688
02:41:22.651 --> 02:41:23.484
already.

5689
02:41:23.550 --> 02:41:27.780
He is not a historian and that's why he's fucking amazing cause mostly story

5690
02:41:27.781 --> 02:41:28.051
hands.

5691
02:41:28.051 --> 02:41:29.820
By the time they got through their phd,

5692
02:41:30.420 --> 02:41:31.740
all the creativity,

5693
02:41:31.741 --> 02:41:35.190
all the juice has been squeezed out of them and there's nothing left because

5694
02:41:35.191 --> 02:41:38.040
there been made to conform to this really boring,

5695
02:41:38.100 --> 02:41:39.050
prudent care,

5696
02:41:39.051 --> 02:41:44.051
full way of telling stories where they can say a sentence without 17 exceptions

5697
02:41:44.281 --> 02:41:45.830
to what they say and you have.

5698
02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:47.940
He didn't see it on paragraph 17 and he's like,

5699
02:41:47.941 --> 02:41:49.110
nobody wants to listen to it.

5700
02:41:49.111 --> 02:41:50.670
It's fucking boring down.

5701
02:41:50.671 --> 02:41:51.451
Carolyn goes on,

5702
02:41:51.451 --> 02:41:52.870
put on a historical podcast.

5703
02:41:52.871 --> 02:41:55.740
Then becomes something that people around the ward one at least into because

5704
02:41:55.741 --> 02:41:57.750
he's a storyteller because it makes it exciting.

5705
02:41:57.810 --> 02:42:00.720
Being boring is a fucking real curse.

5706
02:42:00.900 --> 02:42:01.500
Telling them about it.

5707
02:42:01.500 --> 02:42:04.860
It's almost like there's something wrong with you if you're born.

5708
02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:08.850
It's almost like you can't figure out a better way to express this information,

5709
02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:10.140
this information that you're giving,

5710
02:42:10.170 --> 02:42:12.750
you're giving it an a really fucking shitty way.

5711
02:42:12.780 --> 02:42:13.370
Yup.

5712
02:42:13.370 --> 02:42:17.100
You need to work on your presentation son and that's the thing that eats some

5713
02:42:17.101 --> 02:42:17.610
way.

5714
02:42:17.610 --> 02:42:20.310
It sucks because you can tell to somebody,

5715
02:42:20.311 --> 02:42:20.670
look,

5716
02:42:20.670 --> 02:42:23.250
this sucks because it's so boring and it doesn't have the juice.

5717
02:42:23.460 --> 02:42:24.780
But the reality is that they,

5718
02:42:25.470 --> 02:42:29.250
I think they can all improve with 10% because it's not just a technique,

5719
02:42:29.330 --> 02:42:30.163
it's who you are.

5720
02:42:30.390 --> 02:42:31.050
Right.

5721
02:42:31.050 --> 02:42:33.780
These are people who are boring when they step where they are not teaching and

5722
02:42:33.781 --> 02:42:35.340
you're talking to them down the street.

5723
02:42:35.341 --> 02:42:37.410
It's just their personality that comes through.

5724
02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:39.220
It's like that Song Daniela [inaudible].

5725
02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:40.770
It takes every kind of people.

5726
02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:45.720
I could see Daniel Bell,

5727
02:42:45.721 --> 02:42:47.280
Ellie sitting around his house,

5728
02:42:47.460 --> 02:42:48.510
a little incense lit,

5729
02:42:48.511 --> 02:42:49.231
smoking a joint,

5730
02:42:49.231 --> 02:42:50.610
listened to some seventies Munich,

5731
02:42:51.210 --> 02:42:55.460
so maybe some Jim Croce Seventies Superman's cape,

5732
02:42:58.370 --> 02:42:59.520
no po,

5733
02:42:59.550 --> 02:42:59.940
no.

5734
02:42:59.940 --> 02:43:02.560
Seventh is more like my lowly side,

5735
02:43:02.570 --> 02:43:03.271
like Hendrix,

5736
02:43:03.271 --> 02:43:05.250
led Zeppelin kind of sets your shit.

5737
02:43:05.620 --> 02:43:07.200
Do Air Guitar around the House and your underwear.

5738
02:43:07.410 --> 02:43:08.420
I haven't for quite,

5739
02:43:08.550 --> 02:43:10.200
I'm sure I'm going to get to that level,

5740
02:43:10.201 --> 02:43:11.980
but I haven't quite got to that point yet.

5741
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:12.850
If you do do it,

5742
02:43:12.851 --> 02:43:15.840
please make a youtube video so students know what the fuck they're dealing with.

5743
02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:17.020
Sign up for your course.

5744
02:43:19.630 --> 02:43:20.950
You probably are full glass.

5745
02:43:21.220 --> 02:43:25.450
Have you just played voodoo child and just just fully lipped all the lyric,

5746
02:43:25.460 --> 02:43:25.930
right.

5747
02:43:25.930 --> 02:43:27.940
Knew all of it and went around with it.

5748
02:43:28.090 --> 02:43:28.600
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

5749
02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:32.290
There's every other type now because through online you can find out a lot of

5750
02:43:32.291 --> 02:43:33.730
six a about people.

5751
02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:35.170
A bunch of students ask is like,

5752
02:43:35.580 --> 02:43:38.760
<v 2>is that you windows picture where we are holding a key.</v>

5753
02:43:38.761 --> 02:43:40.600
Then you have your middle finger out.

5754
02:43:40.601 --> 02:43:41.670
Just what's that about?

5755
02:43:41.671 --> 02:43:42.060
I'm like,

5756
02:43:42.060 --> 02:43:42.510
Oh yeah,

5757
02:43:42.510 --> 02:43:43.140
about that.

5758
02:43:43.140 --> 02:43:43.650
Yes.

5759
02:43:43.650 --> 02:43:44.730
I was rebellious.

5760
02:43:44.731 --> 02:43:48.690
It was before I realized the ultimate expression of rebellion is the drunk and

5761
02:43:48.700 --> 02:43:49.533
tower t-shirt.

5762
02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:52.980
Before then I was holding a baby giving the middle finger.

5763
02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:53.310
I said,

5764
02:43:53.310 --> 02:43:54.143
no,

5765
02:43:54.810 --> 02:43:56.360
I love my drunken tourists shit.

5766
02:43:56.361 --> 02:43:57.680
Tee Shirt got damn it and brother,

5767
02:43:57.690 --> 02:43:58.231

5768
02:43:58.231 --> 02:43:59.460
I talk shit about your tee shirt.

5769
02:43:59.461 --> 02:43:59.881
I had to,

5770
02:43:59.881 --> 02:44:00.590
I'm a comedian.

5771
02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:01.530
I got to do what I gotta do.

5772
02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:04.200
I've got to do what I got to do.

5773
02:44:04.201 --> 02:44:06.120
And how do they get your podcasts on iTunes?

5774
02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:07.440
I don't see us.

5775
02:44:07.530 --> 02:44:08.820
And if somebody wants to take your class,

5776
02:44:08.821 --> 02:44:11.940
can they take a class without signing up for anything else at the school?

5777
02:44:11.970 --> 02:44:13.170
Can you just pay to take your class?

5778
02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:14.920
Clearly not.

5779
02:44:15.420 --> 02:44:16.170
Yeah.

5780
02:44:16.170 --> 02:44:16.620
So how,

5781
02:44:16.620 --> 02:44:17.010
how has it,

5782
02:44:17.010 --> 02:44:18.060
how would someone make that happen?

5783
02:44:18.250 --> 02:44:19.083
<v 5>Um,</v>

5784
02:44:19.650 --> 02:44:20.171
Long Beach.

5785
02:44:20.171 --> 02:44:23.520
I'm actually not teaching a whole lot cause I'm there mainly I think I teach it

5786
02:44:23.521 --> 02:44:25.290
as to one class and the rest I do online,

5787
02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:27.010
which is sucks anyway cause as well.

5788
02:44:27.100 --> 02:44:27.933
In any case,

5789
02:44:27.940 --> 02:44:28.690
the um,

5790
02:44:28.690 --> 02:44:29.451
the main thing.

5791
02:44:29.451 --> 02:44:32.680
So I teach mostly at Santa Monica College live in person.

5792
02:44:32.740 --> 02:44:33.573
And uh,

5793
02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:34.510
it depends on the class.

5794
02:44:34.511 --> 02:44:34.660
You know,

5795
02:44:34.660 --> 02:44:37.120
some classes are the enrolled them to the limit,

5796
02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:40.240
other classes they enroll it and then they leave a bunch of empty chairs.

5797
02:44:40.241 --> 02:44:41.050
So

5798
02:44:41.050 --> 02:44:42.520

We will tomorrow night be at,

5834
02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:56.000
what's the name of the theater we're doing?

5835
02:45:57.080 --> 02:45:59.030
He doesn't know it's for motherfucker doesn't know.

5836
02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:00.590
I think it's called the vogue.

5837
02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.841
Yes.

5838
02:46:00.841 --> 02:46:01.250
Yes.

5839
02:46:01.250 --> 02:46:04.250
The Vogue Theater in Vancouver tomorrow night for two shows.

5840
02:46:04.490 --> 02:46:04.851
So,

5841
02:46:04.851 --> 02:46:05.001
uh,

5842
02:46:05.001 --> 02:46:07.730
we can't wait and we're doing something different as time cause you fucking

5843
02:46:07.731 --> 02:46:10.040
people take too long with the God phones that

5844
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:11.930
<v 1>you don't know how to work the camera on.</v>

5845
02:46:11.931 --> 02:46:13.360
So I'm going to take all the photos.

5846
02:46:13.361 --> 02:46:15.200
I'm gonna have someone take them with my camera.

5847
02:46:15.230 --> 02:46:17.840
So we'll get a perfect picture every time and then we'll upload it to the

5848
02:46:17.841 --> 02:46:18.270
website.

5849
02:46:18.270 --> 02:46:19.103
You can take it from there.

5850
02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:22.750
So it will also drive traffic to my website and don't go dude,

5851
02:46:22.751 --> 02:46:25.580
that's fucked up because I don't want to hear hints.

5852
02:46:25.940 --> 02:46:30.140
You bitches need to learn how to use your in 1967 fucking whack ass cell phone.

5853
02:46:30.141 --> 02:46:31.340
I'd have to wait for Dammit,

5854
02:46:31.490 --> 02:46:32.870
I shut it off by accident.

5855
02:46:32.900 --> 02:46:33.710
Hold on.

5856
02:46:33.710 --> 02:46:35.870
And there's a line of a thousand people taking pictures.

5857
02:46:36.020 --> 02:46:38.120
That's just ridiculous to the people that work at the theaters.

5858
02:46:38.210 --> 02:46:40.340
So they've requested I streamline the process.

5859
02:46:40.490 --> 02:46:41.690
So that is the only solution.

5860
02:46:42.050 --> 02:46:42.260
Alright,

5861
02:46:42.260 --> 02:46:42.980

5867
02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:50.120

5868
02:46:50.121 --> 02:46:50.750
