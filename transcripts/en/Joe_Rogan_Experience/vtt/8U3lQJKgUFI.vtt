152
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 2>This one was like just the stupidest,</v>

153
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 2>funniest thing you've ever seen.</v>

154
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Like the way they try to do,</v>

155
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 2>like they were trying to do the anti-drug message in the 60s and bud cort plays</v>

156
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>this kind of rampaging hippie Weirdo.</v>

157
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

158
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:37.031
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

159
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:42.031
<v Speaker 1>here's the definition of grindhouse is an American term for a theater that</v>

160
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>mainly shows exploitation films.</v>

161
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>It's named after the defunct burlesque theater's located on 42nd street in New</v>

162
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>York City where a bump and grind dancing and strip tease were featured.</v>

163
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.443
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

164
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.591
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

165
00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>

166
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>that's the old 42nd street.</v>

167
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>That's back when New York City like,</v>

168
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>had like a really fucked up area.</v>

169
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what it was like?</v>

170
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

171
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 1>did you ever go to New York City when it was crazy?</v>

172
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>

173
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:11.141
<v Speaker 2>I've heard about it,</v>

174
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 2>but I never went there.</v>

175
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

176
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

177
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I was there many times when it was,</v>

178
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>when it was still dangerous.</v>

179
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting that 42nd street was there,</v>

180
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>a completely different place.</v>

181
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.183
<v Speaker 1>It was this,</v>

182
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>they decided they made like this active decision to clean that fucking place</v>

183
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:25.960
<v Speaker 1>opposite,</v>

184
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.960
<v Speaker 1>take out all the bullshit and make it like super like fan friendly and super,</v>

185
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:31.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

187
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

188
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>a visitor friendly.</v>

189
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.490
<v Speaker 1>So w what it used to be was like one dirty little stripped ts and peep show and</v>

190
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 1>triple x movie and it was fucking creepy people.</v>

191
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Creepy people hanging out.</v>

192
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like,</v>

193
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.330
<v Speaker 1>let's Google a old photos of,</v>

194
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.870
<v Speaker 2>it's like taxi driver.</v>

195
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like the movie taxi driver.</v>

196
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 2>That's where I seen,</v>

197
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.963

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

199
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.950
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

200
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.990
<v Speaker 1>that I remember that.</v>

201
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was like,</v>

202
00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I came to New York</v>

203
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.770
<v Speaker 3>a couple of times when I was in my teenage years and I remember being there and</v>

204
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.110
<v Speaker 3>wandered around called what a fucking crazy place.</v>

205
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.801
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

206
00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:08.460
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

207
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I had family in New Jersey and uh,</v>

208
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.560
<v Speaker 3>they had,</v>

209
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.490
<v Speaker 3>they taken me to Manhattan a few times when I was young.</v>

210
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.230
<v Speaker 3>I remember life,</v>

211
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.860
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

212
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.410
<v Speaker 3>I barely remember it when I was like a little kid,</v>

213
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.611
<v Speaker 3>barely remember.</v>

214
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:22.860
<v Speaker 3>But I remember like feeling it's like dangerous.</v>

215
00:05:22.861 --> 00:05:24.510
<v Speaker 3>Like it's so big and crazy.</v>

216
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.853
<v Speaker 3>It is dangerous.</v>

217
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.750
<v Speaker 3>But I remember when I was in my teenage years is when I saw like the peep shows</v>

218
00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:31.584
<v Speaker 3>and all that shit.</v>

219
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.581
<v Speaker 3>I saw those,</v>

220
00:05:32.581 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

221
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.990
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

222
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.890
<v Speaker 3>we came there for a karate tournament.</v>

223
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:37.770
<v Speaker 3>There was a big karate tournament these do at Madison Square Garden every year.</v>

224
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.870
<v Speaker 3>So we came in and me and a bunch of fucking soft dorks from Boston,</v>

225
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

226
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.740
<v Speaker 3>Newton even where I was from the suburbs of Boston to go to this crazy fucking</v>

227
00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:49.561
<v Speaker 3>city.</v>

228
00:05:49.561 --> 00:05:51.990
<v Speaker 3>Like we were essentially living in Mayberry.</v>

229
00:05:51.991 --> 00:05:53.580
<v Speaker 3>Compare it to like New York City.</v>

230
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.970
<v Speaker 3>So you have your own problems with like socially with people everywhere.</v>

231
00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.963
<v Speaker 3>Where I,</v>

232
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.811
<v Speaker 1>where I grew up,</v>

233
00:05:58.811 --> 00:06:00.670
<v Speaker 1>like I went to Newton south high school.</v>

234
00:06:00.671 --> 00:06:02.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like the woman nice as high schools ever.</v>

235
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.650
<v Speaker 1>You know you're always going to have problems with human beings.</v>

236
00:06:05.651 --> 00:06:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Whenever he gets 17 year olds and you mix them all together,</v>

237
00:06:07.781 --> 00:06:08.710
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be progress.</v>

238
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.190
<v Speaker 1>But like very few fights in school,</v>

239
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.550
<v Speaker 1>very few like no one got really seriously injured.</v>

240
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.180
<v Speaker 1>You know there was like a few squabbles and people got upset with people,</v>

241
00:06:19.181 --> 00:06:20.710
<v Speaker 1>but other than that it was a nice place to live.</v>

242
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize how easy it had it until you're,</v>

243
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.670
<v Speaker 1>you're in Manhattan and you know and you're like 17 years old and you're like in</v>

244
00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:28.510
<v Speaker 1>time screaming like,</v>

245
00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:30.790
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this place?</v>

246
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Like this place is crazy.</v>

247
00:06:32.711 --> 00:06:36.970
<v Speaker 1>It's just one person after another who wants to fuck you and give you some new</v>

248
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:37.804
<v Speaker 1>disease?</v>

249
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Like one it just people looking at fuck people,</v>

250
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.890
<v Speaker 1>people looking at jerk off and people looking to go sit and watch someone play</v>

251
00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 1>with their ass hole in front of you while you be,</v>

252
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.380
<v Speaker 1>but while you beat off in a booth and then someone cleans that like that was</v>

253
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:51.214
<v Speaker 1>time square.</v>

254
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Ugh.</v>

255
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.930
<v Speaker 1>No one cleans it there.</v>

256
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.921
<v Speaker 1>They did clean it.</v>

257
00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:55.330
<v Speaker 1>They would go in there with a mop man.</v>

258
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.960
<v Speaker 1>They would do,</v>

259
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.660
<v Speaker 1>they would go in there with a mop and they'd look at you like you motherfucker.</v>

260
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.030
<v Speaker 5>I told you when I was in San Francisco I went to one of those places and I</v>

261
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.450
<v Speaker 5>accident like I've never been to the place where the thing goes up and you're in</v>

262
00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:09.360
<v Speaker 5>like this room and there's just a bunch of people behind this glass like</v>

263
00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:12.780
<v Speaker 5>fingering themselves and stuff and accidentally put my hand on the side.</v>

264
00:07:12.781 --> 00:07:13.531
<v Speaker 5>Like go was like a little thing.</v>

265
00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:14.364
<v Speaker 5>It was wet</v>

266
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:16.803
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

267
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 5>That's not good.</v>

268
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.620
<v Speaker 5>That is not good.</v>

269
00:07:19.621 --> 00:07:20.640
<v Speaker 5>And like the guy who was like,</v>

270
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.061
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

271
00:07:21.061 --> 00:07:22.890
<v Speaker 5>oh I think I just put my hand and common cause oh no.</v>

272
00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:25.320
<v Speaker 5>We cleaned those things every in between every person.</v>

273
00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:27.150
<v Speaker 5>And then I just watched people going in and out and I was like,</v>

274
00:07:27.151 --> 00:07:27.751
<v Speaker 5>no you don't.</v>

275
00:07:27.751 --> 00:07:29.940
<v Speaker 5>And watching people how you play your hand.</v>

276
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

277
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.240
<v Speaker 1>it's just cells.</v>

278
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it man.</v>

279
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Cause you had to choose between a guy punching you in the head or jizzing on</v>

280
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:38.414
<v Speaker 1>your face.</v>

281
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.081
<v Speaker 1>What would you pick?</v>

282
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:39.914
<v Speaker 1>Punching in the head?</v>

283
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I would take the gels in the face all day.</v>

284
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.571
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

285
00:07:42.571 --> 00:07:43.710
<v Speaker 6>why would you do dunk?</v>

286
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.383
<v Speaker 6>You know why?</v>

287
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.230
<v Speaker 6>Because I'll tell you why.</v>

288
00:07:49.231 --> 00:07:49.821
<v Speaker 6>Because A,</v>

00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:50.140
<v Speaker 6>I've been</v>

290
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.850
<v Speaker 1>punched in the face and it's not fun.</v>

291
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.751
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>

292
00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I've accidentally come in my face and it was not that bad.</v>

293
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.103
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

294
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.330
<v Speaker 6>it was delicious.</v>

295
00:07:58.331 --> 00:07:58.900
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>

296
00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.231
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

297
00:07:59.231 --> 00:08:00.064
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't delicious,</v>

298
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.690
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't nothing that hurt,</v>

299
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

300
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:03.400
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty,</v>

301
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.240
<v Speaker 1>pretty pain free.</v>

302
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.373
<v Speaker 1>It was warm.</v>

303
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

304
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.360
<v Speaker 1>when I was like 16,</v>

305
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>

306
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

307
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.090
<v Speaker 1>I was completely retarded.</v>

308
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Of course I was using the pullout method.</v>

309
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I might also teenage girlfriend,</v>

310
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.210
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know what the fuck word and we're idiots.</v>

311
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:17.290
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't have been alone together.</v>

312
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.011
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

313
00:08:18.011 --> 00:08:18.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

314
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.750
<v Speaker 1>I would pull out and one time I pulled out and I shot it so far and hit me in</v>

315
00:08:22.751 --> 00:08:23.584
<v Speaker 1>the face.</v>

316
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like looking down at it as I pulled it out,</v>

317
00:08:25.991 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I guess I wanted to see how much came out and it hit me right in the Mug flat</v>

318
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:31.901
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

319
00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:32.171
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

320
00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:33.070
<v Speaker 1>So that's what it feels like.</v>

321
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.360
<v Speaker 1>It was kinda exciting.</v>

322
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.900
<v Speaker 6>Put Yourself,</v>

323
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 6>put yourself in the girl's position.</v>

324
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 6>It feels like,</v>

325
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.580
<v Speaker 6>why do we want a hot load in the face?</v>

326
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.220
<v Speaker 6>It's hot,</v>

327
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:46.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.060
<v Speaker 1>like God represents,</v>

329
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.100
<v Speaker 1>represents the man's passion on your face.</v>

330
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Not that I want it from anyone other than me.</v>

331
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't sound like it at all.</v>

332
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

333
00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:58.980
<v Speaker 1>it only happened once.</v>

334
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 1>This other things that it only happened once then I'm shocked with one of them</v>

335
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:04.040
<v Speaker 1>is um,</v>

336
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 1>beating off in the car.</v>

337
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.290
<v Speaker 1>I've only been off in the car once in my entire driving.</v>

338
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.540
<v Speaker 1>One time when I was living in Boston,</v>

340
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 1>I was working for a Limo Company and uh,</v>

341
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I was driving home and it was a long ride and it was horny.</v>

342
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>So I just beat off.</v>

343
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.170
<v Speaker 1>It was just like something to do and a,</v>

344
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I just squirted a load inside my shirt,</v>

345
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 1>tucked it back of my pants.</v>

346
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

347
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:24.750
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

348
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

349
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I remember doing it and I remember thinking,</v>

350
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

351
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.421
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

352
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 1>so here's some new fucked up thing I do now because I figured I would just keep</v>

353
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:31.200
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

354
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

355
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I'd never jerked off in the car before and be in like 20 years old or whatever.</v>

356
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:35.911
<v Speaker 1>I was at the time,</v>

357
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:36.211
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

358
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:37.380
<v Speaker 1>what an idiot I did.</v>

359
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:40.110
<v Speaker 1>You really just start jerking off in the car because that's what you're going to</v>

360
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:41.070
<v Speaker 1>start doing all the time now.</v>

361
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Dummy.</v>

362
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't,</v>

363
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.051
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

364
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>I never did it again.</v>

365
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:44.671
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you mean?</v>

366
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Like that would become your fetish.</v>

367
00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Like jerking.</v>

368
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

369
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I figured if I found one other place where I was comfortable jerking off,</v>

370
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good thing.</v>

371
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.091
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

372
00:09:53.091 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Because have jerked off at work before</v>

373
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:55.421
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

374
00:09:55.421 --> 00:09:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Imagine a world where jerking off was just normal and like,</v>

375
00:09:58.121 --> 00:09:58.870
<v Speaker 2>do you just like,</v>

376
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:59.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

377
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.910
<v Speaker 2>in line people are jerking off.</v>

378
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.500
<v Speaker 1>One time I jerked off at work twice because I this really hot date that night</v>

379
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.790
<v Speaker 1>and I jerked,</v>

380
00:10:06.791 --> 00:10:07.750
<v Speaker 1>I was doing construction.</v>

381
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I was in his basement that would the,</v>

382
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.150
<v Speaker 1>we're building this house and uh,</v>

383
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I would just open the door,</v>

384
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.680
<v Speaker 1>beat off onto the Dr</v>

385
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.740
<v Speaker 1>and then go back to work.</v>

386
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I did it twice.</v>

387
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.530
<v Speaker 1>That's how fucked up I was.</v>

388
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.440
<v Speaker 1>And then when I went on the date that night with the girl,</v>

389
00:10:23.441 --> 00:10:25.090
<v Speaker 1>I was like barely into it.</v>

390
00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:25.541
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

391
00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I'd wanted to fuck this girl for so long and we finally ran into each other</v>

392
00:10:30.251 --> 00:10:31.390
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and I was like,</v>

00:10:31.991 --> 00:10:33.130
<v Speaker 1>And she was so down,</v>

395
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.020
<v Speaker 1>but I was like barely hard.</v>

396
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.100

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:34.871
<v Speaker 1>go for it baby.</v>

439
00:11:34.871 --> 00:11:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Like just on a whim,</v>

440
00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:37.300
<v Speaker 1>on a hope that it's a good thing.</v>

441
00:11:37.301 --> 00:11:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

442
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.970
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden she's sucking on her fingers and you going,</v>

443
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:40.843
<v Speaker 1>where's this going?</v>

444
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.720
<v Speaker 2>See in the world of Kurzwell that we're talking about,</v>

445
00:11:43.721 --> 00:11:45.940
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you're going to be able to record everything,</v>

446
00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.280
<v Speaker 2>there will be a way that you can act and the way that,</v>

447
00:11:48.281 --> 00:11:50.470
<v Speaker 2>like guys will hack into their girlfriend's email.</v>

448
00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 2>You'll be able to hack into your girlfriends like past,</v>

449
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.500
<v Speaker 2>like see a scan of like you could actually just enter it in.</v>

450
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.620
<v Speaker 2>How many buttholes is her finger been improved?</v>

451
00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.613
<v Speaker 2>28.</v>

452
00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:01.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

453
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading that sexist.</v>

454
00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.493
<v Speaker 1>Go on a book.</v>

455
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading this sex is pretty good.</v>

456
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

457
00:12:05.341 --> 00:12:06.174
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating.</v>

458
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.270
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I find fascinating is all the different theories</v>

459
00:12:09.271 --> 00:12:14.271
<v Speaker 1>about why people act and behave certain ways when it comes to like sexual,</v>

460
00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:15.894
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>

461
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.870
<v Speaker 1>how many sexual partners has your wife had.</v>

462
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

463
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Why it's so important that you limit that number.</v>

464
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.370
<v Speaker 1>That you can trust her and keep our Ra.</v>

465
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.200
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating stuff,</v>

466
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:25.730
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

467

<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

471
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.320
<v Speaker 2>That's a really cool dude too.</v>

472
00:12:30.321 --> 00:12:31.041
<v Speaker 2>Chris Ryan,</v>

473
00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:33.090
<v Speaker 2>he's bred him on your podcast twice.</v>

474
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Twice.</v>

475
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

476
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Twice.</v>

477
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Get in touch with him and try to see if he'll do this.</v>

478
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:37.251
<v Speaker 1>Cause he,</v>

479
00:12:37.251 --> 00:12:37.890
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>

480
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.770
<v Speaker 1>he's really very interesting.</v>

481
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.110
<v Speaker 1>I love the part about the Yucatan,</v>

482
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.300
<v Speaker 1>the name of the Yucatan.</v>

483
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that part?</v>

484
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:45.923
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that.</v>

485
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.360
<v Speaker 1>The they,</v>

486
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 1>when Columbus is people or Cortez of came to the Yucatan,</v>

487
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.950
<v Speaker 1>they asked the people like,</v>

488
00:12:54.951 --> 00:12:55.370
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

489
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:56.630
<v Speaker 1>What do you call this place?</v>

490
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.190
<v Speaker 1>And they made this sound,</v>

491
00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.713
<v Speaker 1>not that sound,</v>

492
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.020
<v Speaker 1>but they made the sound like we could talk her at home,</v>

493
00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:03.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

494
00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:05.690
<v Speaker 1>and the guy said you could tighten close enough caught.</v>

495
00:13:05.691 --> 00:13:07.610
<v Speaker 1>So they say we're going to call it the Yucatan.</v>

496
00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.091
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

497
00:13:08.091 --> 00:13:09.980
<v Speaker 1>it turned out that the Mayan scholars,</v>

498
00:13:09.981 --> 00:13:12.620
<v Speaker 1>after all those years of deciphering they,</v>

499
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.120
<v Speaker 1>they do that.</v>

500
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.190
<v Speaker 1>What he was trying to say was,</v>

501
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what you're saying.</v>

502
00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:19.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what he was saying,</v>

503
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.720
<v Speaker 1>that they had taken to you to talk to Larry.</v>

504
00:13:23.721 --> 00:13:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that amazing?</v>

505
00:13:24.621 --> 00:13:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

506
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.150
<v Speaker 1>That's such an amazing,</v>

507
00:13:26.151 --> 00:13:28.310
<v Speaker 1>like I love knowing shit like that,</v>

508
00:13:28.311 --> 00:13:31.610
<v Speaker 1>like house and then knowing that that was only a few hundred years ago.</v>

509
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

510
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.500
<v Speaker 1>That's really kind of nuts.</v>

511
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.540
<v Speaker 1>W we're so spoiled by the time that we arrived,</v>

512
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

513
00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:39.131
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

514
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:44.131
<v Speaker 1>we're so spoiled that being alive in the year 2012 like just a few hundred years</v>

515
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:46.670
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

516
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:51.670
<v Speaker 1>there was people that in boats and just traveled and didn't know where the fuck</v>

517
00:13:52.341 --> 00:13:53.174
<v Speaker 1>they were going.</v>

518
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.220
<v Speaker 1>And had no idea what they would find and didn't have it</v>

519
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.113
<v Speaker 2>math.</v>

520
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.980
<v Speaker 2>But Dude,</v>

521
00:13:58.981 --> 00:14:01.000
<v Speaker 2>think about what is it 500 years ago.</v>

522
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.410
<v Speaker 2>I love to think about that and I love to think about that fucking feeling,</v>

523
00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:06.400
<v Speaker 2>that feeling that,</v>

524
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:07.840
<v Speaker 2>that that's a feeling.</v>

525
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:08.441
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

526
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:09.490
<v Speaker 2>we can find that.</v>

527
00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:09.671
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

528
00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:09.791
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

529
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:10.061
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

530
00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:10.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

531
00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:11.470
<v Speaker 2>esoterically say,</v>

532
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:11.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

533
00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:15.060
<v Speaker 2>we can search into the world of psychedelics for new lands or,</v>

534
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:15.940
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

535
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.300
<v Speaker 2>But no one is ever going to know until interstellar travel happens.</v>

536
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:24.340
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever going to know that fucking feeling of being on a ship and for the</v>

537
00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:28.170
<v Speaker 2>first time seeing land in a place where no one knows there's land.</v>

538
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

539
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.100
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that you would have the audacity to go look in the ocean,</v>

540
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.010
<v Speaker 1>to not know what's on the other side,</v>

541
00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:37.960
<v Speaker 1>to just go out there like,</v>

542
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.070
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

543
00:14:39.071 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 1>you had to have fucking tremendous balls.</v>

544
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

545
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.100
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

546
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:42.660
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

547
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.510
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things,</v>

548
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 1>it must've been amazing back then was the ability to see the stars.</v>

549
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Like as long as it wasn't cloudy out,</v>

550
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:54.890
<v Speaker 1>you could really see everything because there was no light pollution where if</v>

551
00:14:54.891 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

552
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.620
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever been in the country in the middle of the night,</v>

553
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:57.980
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

554
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.730
<v Speaker 1>To look up and on a clear night and just see a fucking unbelievable amounts of</v>

555
00:15:01.731 --> 00:15:02.540
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>

556
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.590
<v Speaker 1>It really makes you sad that that's not a regular feature like that.</v>

557
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:10.430
<v Speaker 1>What we've done by creating these beautiful cities and these safe roads to</v>

558
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:11.210
<v Speaker 1>travel on,</v>

559
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.680
<v Speaker 1>we've disconnected ourselves from the vision of the cosmos of our part in the</v>

560
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:16.490
<v Speaker 1>cosmos.</v>

561
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

562
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.320
<v Speaker 1>When you're like in the country,</v>

563
00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:18.591
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

564
00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:22.310
<v Speaker 1>you're staying in a farm and you go like kick back in a hammock and you look up</v>

565
00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:25.970
<v Speaker 1>and the entire sky is filled with stars.</v>

566
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 1>That is a perspective enhancing experience.</v>

567
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a visual psychedelic staring at the stars is a very visual psychedelic.</v>

568
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:35.661
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

569
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:39.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've got like white pouring into your eyes.</v>

570
00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:40.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

571
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.190
<v Speaker 2>From the far reaches of the universe.</v>

572
00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:43.760
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

573
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Speaker 2>you've got light coming into your eyes.</v>

574
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.250
<v Speaker 2>It's from,</v>

575
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:49.130
<v Speaker 2>so like it's so long ago</v>

576
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:50.170
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

577
00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:50.420
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

578
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:54.290
<v Speaker 1>you're getting that feeling that you get when you see something beautiful that</v>

579
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.920
<v Speaker 1>we seek out beautiful things which we seek out them,</v>

580
00:15:57.921 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>whether their flowers or sculptures or a person or car.</v>

581
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.930
<v Speaker 1>There's something that strikes us when we see something beautiful.</v>

582
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.141
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

583
00:16:06.141 --> 00:16:08.510
<v Speaker 1>it's all subjective to each person.</v>

584
00:16:08.511 --> 00:16:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Whenever they're beautiful is it he lights that charge in their mind?</v>

585
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

586
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:16.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you ever seen a guy who's like really into old cars and he sees an old</v>

587
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Speaker 1>corvette or something like that.</v>

588
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh this is a 67 look at the lines on this baby and you see him like his fucking</v>

589
00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:25.100
<v Speaker 1>eyes light up and like these,</v>

590
00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.340
<v Speaker 1>there's a charge that a person gets from a thing of beauty,</v>

591
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:29.710
<v Speaker 1>from seeing something that's</v>

592
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.170
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>

593
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:35.170
<v Speaker 2>There's an idea that that thing of beauty is lying underneath everything that</v>

594
00:16:35.841 --> 00:16:40.841
<v Speaker 2>the world is just covering that beauty up and that people use objects as a way</v>

595
00:16:41.091 --> 00:16:43.940
<v Speaker 2>to limit the beauty because to,</v>

596
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.650
<v Speaker 2>to like really accept the whole thing is like would be so potent that you start</v>

597
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:52.220
<v Speaker 2>off like getting that feeling from cars or you start off getting that feeling</v>

598
00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:55.940
<v Speaker 2>from looking up at the sky or you start off getting that feeling from falling in</v>

599
00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:56.271
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>

600
00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:59.360
<v Speaker 2>But like that feeling is like underneath everything,</v>

601
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.330
<v Speaker 2>that's what everything is composed of is that sense of like,</v>

602
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:03.890
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

603
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.210
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>

604
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's like a peak.</v>

605
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.820
<v Speaker 2>That's a peak feeling,</v>

606
00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:10.250
<v Speaker 2>that feeling of being like whatever the thing is,</v>

607
00:17:10.251 --> 00:17:11.240
<v Speaker 2>the activates it.</v>

608
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I think that maybe that's what enlightenment is,</v>

609
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:16.220
<v Speaker 2>is when you just hit that feeling perpetually.</v>

610
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.560
<v Speaker 2>You're just perpetually in that space of like,</v>

611
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.090
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

612
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.400
<v Speaker 2>this is amazing.</v>

613
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.161
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

614
00:17:23.161 --> 00:17:23.994
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

615
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who was like really into Buddhism and she had this thing on her</v>

616
00:17:27.751 --> 00:17:28.610
<v Speaker 1>wall that said,</v>

617
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:28.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

618

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

620
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:34.500
<v Speaker 1>And I remember reading that going,</v>

621
00:17:34.501 --> 00:17:34.741
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

622
00:17:34.741 --> 00:17:36.600
<v Speaker 1>that is a profound statement.</v>

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:37.141
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

624
00:17:37.141 --> 00:17:39.780
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment is possible in this lifetime.</v>

625
00:17:39.781 --> 00:17:40.790
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking like,</v>

626
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:41.460
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

627

628
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.560
<v Speaker 1>what a weird thing we all have in our heads is this,</v>

629
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.760
<v Speaker 1>this burning desire to get shit together.</v>

630
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody would love to be enlightened.</v>

631
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

634
00:17:56.301 --> 00:17:57.380
<v Speaker 1>tells you they don't want to be.</v>

635
00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.311
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

647
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.660

648
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:08.830
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they don't want to be</v>

660
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.620
<v Speaker 1>pretty good when you talk to people and they have this box that they don't want</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

680
00:18:42.941 --> 00:18:47.050
<v Speaker 2>constricted life sucks for the person who's living in the constricted life and</v>

681
00:18:47.051 --> 00:18:50.050
<v Speaker 2>for the people living around the person and the constricted life and it's like</v>

682
00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.093
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

683
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.880
<v Speaker 2>if you just play around with that fucking idea that you can permanently,</v>

684
00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.100
<v Speaker 2>permanently shift your consciousness so that you are experiencing life in the</v>

685
00:19:00.101 --> 00:19:03.460
<v Speaker 2>way that like those however many times you've had to happen in your life.</v>

686
00:19:03.461 --> 00:19:04.151
<v Speaker 2>Some people more,</v>

687
00:19:04.151 --> 00:19:09.151
<v Speaker 2>sometimes last when you're for the first time you like accomplish some big thing</v>

688
00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:10.870
<v Speaker 2>and you get that sense of like,</v>

689
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.681
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

690
00:19:11.681 --> 00:19:11.891
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

691
00:19:11.891 --> 00:19:12.724
<v Speaker 2>I can fucking,</v>

692
00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:16.000
<v Speaker 2>I can really do shit that I didn't think I could do.</v>

693
00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.180
<v Speaker 2>That feeling is like the universe at that moment unfolds.</v>

694
00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like a whole new room,</v>

695
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.520
<v Speaker 2>a whole new giant land pops open and your subjective universe.</v>

696
00:19:25.521 --> 00:19:25.901
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>

697
00:19:25.901 --> 00:19:26.734
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

698
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:30.310
<v Speaker 2>there's an entire other part of this life I had no idea about.</v>

699
00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:30.701
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

700
00:19:30.701 --> 00:19:35.701
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you can always be in that state of recognizing that this is the</v>

701
00:19:36.491 --> 00:19:39.970
<v Speaker 2>most beautiful peak experience that could happen to anything,</v>

702
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.250
<v Speaker 2>which I think is what enlightened people,</v>

703
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.780
<v Speaker 2>the people I've been around,</v>

704
00:19:43.781 --> 00:19:44.710
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>

705
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

706
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.890
<v Speaker 2>very advanced.</v>

707
00:19:46.891 --> 00:19:47.970
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't call them enlightened.</v>

708
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.230
<v Speaker 2>They're just happy man.</v>

709
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.550
<v Speaker 2>They're just like hobbies,</v>

710
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.900
<v Speaker 2>the wrong word for it though.</v>

711
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:55.020
<v Speaker 2>They're like connected and there</v>

712
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:56.461
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

713
00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:57.294
<v Speaker 1>really</v>

714
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.670
<v Speaker 2>not afraid to express love.</v>

715
00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:01.121
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

716
00:20:01.121 --> 00:20:01.751
<v Speaker 2>They're very,</v>

717
00:20:01.751 --> 00:20:03.520
<v Speaker 2>they're feeling love all the time.</v>

718
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.000
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's a cool idea that you could feel that all the time.</v>

719
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.150
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a beautiful idea that you could be in that place all the time.</v>

720
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.270
<v Speaker 1>If you're careful about your friends,</v>

721
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:12.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

722
00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:13.201
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

723
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:15.480
<v Speaker 1>you only surround yourself with positive people.</v>

724
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 1>I think you worked out,</v>

725
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I think you can do that all the time.</v>

726
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.180
<v Speaker 1>It's all about constructing that environment though.</v>

727
00:20:21.181 --> 00:20:21.481
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

728
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:24.540
<v Speaker 1>you have to like do that by sharp editing throughout,</v>

729
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:25.410
<v Speaker 1>throughout your entire life.</v>

730
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:27.870
<v Speaker 1>You've got to figure out how to edit yourself and edit people.</v>

731
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

732
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.591
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

733
00:20:28.591 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 1>you've got to figure out how to get,</v>

734
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.320
<v Speaker 1>get the most,</v>

735
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:31.991
<v Speaker 1>like they'll,</v>

736
00:20:31.991 --> 00:20:35.820
<v Speaker 1>they'll get rid of as many of your own negative instances.</v>

737
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Any of those that you can get away with,</v>

738
00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:38.310
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

739
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.630
<v Speaker 1>not causing yourself,</v>

740
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.250
<v Speaker 1>like minimize that,</v>

741
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.510
<v Speaker 1>tried to get it down to zero.</v>

742
00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:43.344
<v Speaker 1>We're none.</v>

743
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:48.410
<v Speaker 1>None of the negative moments are created because of your actions and figure out</v>

744
00:20:48.521 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Speaker 1>who's creating all those other negative moments and eliminate the interaction</v>

745
00:20:53.021 --> 00:20:53.854
<v Speaker 1>with those people.</v>

746
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

747
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:59.220
<v Speaker 1>if you can do that and then find likeminded folks who will not put anything,</v>

748
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.830
<v Speaker 1>try not to do anything negative to their friends and don't want to accept</v>

749
00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:03.820
<v Speaker 1>anything negative either.</v>

750
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.601
<v Speaker 1>The near about,</v>

751
00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:06.330
<v Speaker 1>around a bunch of people who love each other.</v>

752
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Let me throw out an idea because this is what you're talking about.</v>

753
00:21:10.141 --> 00:21:12.780
<v Speaker 2>It's something that some hippie bullshit will start to calm.</v>

754
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.000
<v Speaker 2>You ain't hippy bullshit,</v>

755
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:14.250
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

756
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.420
<v Speaker 2>This is like the idea of like,</v>

757
00:21:15.421 --> 00:21:15.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

758
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.890
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning,</v>

759
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

760
00:21:17.461 --> 00:21:17.850
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

761
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:18.420
<v Speaker 2>there's uh,</v>

762
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.253
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

763
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.630
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of spiritual life is what they say.</v>

764
00:21:21.631 --> 00:21:24.310
<v Speaker 2>They say the beginning of spiritual life is like a tea,</v>

765
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:24.761
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

766
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:26.490
<v Speaker 2>a tendril like uh,</v>

767
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

768
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.770
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of like when a tree grows,</v>

769
00:21:28.771 --> 00:21:29.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

770
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.840
<v Speaker 2>And when a trees growing at first,</v>

771
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:31.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

772
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.940
<v Speaker 2>the most gigantic trees started off as a tiny little fucking sprig.</v>

773
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.070
<v Speaker 2>So when you're in that place,</v>

774
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.690
<v Speaker 2>it's really important to keep shit out.</v>

775
00:21:39.691 --> 00:21:40.860
<v Speaker 2>They can like fuck you up.</v>

776
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.490
<v Speaker 2>And that's the idea of cutting people out or like cutting out the negative</v>

777
00:21:44.491 --> 00:21:45.090
<v Speaker 2>elements.</v>

778
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.540
<v Speaker 2>But then there's this other idea that I was listening to some Ron doss lecture.</v>

779
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:53.540
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about reactivity and that when you're around someone who's got a</v>

780
00:21:53.941 --> 00:21:57.420
<v Speaker 2>difficult personality or someone who's like an instigator,</v>

781
00:21:57.421 --> 00:21:58.860
<v Speaker 2>a drama vortex,</v>

782
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:03.300
<v Speaker 2>you still get to decide if you're going to be reactive to that person or not.</v>

783
00:22:03.301 --> 00:22:07.050
<v Speaker 2>You still get to be in control of the way you feel around that person.</v>

784
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.100
<v Speaker 2>But in the beginning,</v>

785
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.190
<v Speaker 2>that person can make you feel like shit when you're around an asshole.</v>

786
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Your mood will drop,</v>

787
00:22:12.391 --> 00:22:13.260
<v Speaker 2>your mood shifts,</v>

788
00:22:13.261 --> 00:22:13.981
<v Speaker 2>you get mad,</v>

789
00:22:13.981 --> 00:22:14.791
<v Speaker 2>you get unhappy,</v>

790
00:22:14.791 --> 00:22:15.870
<v Speaker 2>you feel threatened.</v>

791
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.130
<v Speaker 2>But the idea is,</v>

792
00:22:17.131 --> 00:22:20.850
<v Speaker 2>is as you advance in gain more and more control of your consciousness,</v>

793
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.290
<v Speaker 2>then that stops happening.</v>

794
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.980
<v Speaker 1>So you use that asshole as an emotional gym.</v>

795
00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.173
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

796
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.920
<v Speaker 1>You use them as an emotional or a psychological growth sparring partner.</v>

797
00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

798
00:22:31.221 --> 00:22:33.110
<v Speaker 1>And as you deal with their Douchey Enos,</v>

799
00:22:33.111 --> 00:22:36.350
<v Speaker 1>you learn how to better navigate Douche Enos throughout your life.</v>

800
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:36.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

801
00:22:36.701 --> 00:22:40.210
<v Speaker 2>And also for the first time when the asshole is around someone who isn't</v>

802
00:22:40.211 --> 00:22:41.920
<v Speaker 2>reacting to them being an asshole,</v>

803
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.031
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be like,</v>

804
00:22:43.031 --> 00:22:44.080
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>

805
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Cause then if their whole life they've been going through life,</v>

806
00:22:46.511 --> 00:22:47.830
<v Speaker 2>getting cues from people like,</v>

807
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh I don't think so.</v>

808
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.690
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

809
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:50.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

810
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.260
<v Speaker 2>So all of a sudden if they're around someone who's like beaming,</v>

811
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

812
00:22:54.011 --> 00:22:55.390
<v Speaker 2>beaming and the way that they,</v>

813
00:22:55.391 --> 00:22:57.160
<v Speaker 2>you would be beaming around when you saw it.</v>

814
00:22:57.161 --> 00:22:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Like when Joey Diaz walks into a room,</v>

815
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.450
<v Speaker 2>you're beaming that way around a cunt.</v>

816
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.501
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly they're like,</v>

817
00:23:02.501 --> 00:23:04.870
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>

818
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Well the real problem though is when they become physically violent,</v>

819
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.660
<v Speaker 1>when you have dump constant wanna Punch you,</v>

820
00:23:12.661 --> 00:23:14.250
<v Speaker 1>that's when you run into a real situation.</v>

821
00:23:14.251 --> 00:23:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

822
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:15.523
<v Speaker 1>But how often did,</v>

823
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean that doesn't happen that most of the time,</v>

824
00:23:17.551 --> 00:23:19.950
<v Speaker 1>but you've managed to surround yourself with,</v>

825
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:20.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

826
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:21.383
<v Speaker 1>hipsters.</v>

827
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're in certain parts of the country,</v>

828
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.200
<v Speaker 1>certain parts of a city,</v>

829
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:26.180
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

830
00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.630
<v Speaker 1>you get punched in the face randomly.</v>

831
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>

832
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:29.011
<v Speaker 1>Terror.</v>

833
00:23:29.011 --> 00:23:29.880
<v Speaker 1>There's a terrible video,</v>

834
00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.560
<v Speaker 1>a woman in London,</v>

835
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.930
<v Speaker 1>some guy just comes and cracks are for no reason.</v>

836
00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not that they're looking for the guys,</v>

837
00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:38.010
<v Speaker 1>some teenage girls knocked unconscious,</v>

838
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.480
<v Speaker 1>demonic son of a bitch.</v>

839
00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.570
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucked up that people are capable of doing shit like that and that</v>

840
00:23:42.571 --> 00:23:42.880
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

841
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.430
<v Speaker 1>there's the broad spectrum of the possible human actions.</v>

842
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.331
<v Speaker 1>It's so broad.</v>

843
00:23:48.331 --> 00:23:48.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

844
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.920
<v Speaker 1>you could be a god that she could have crossed paths with a guy who was like,</v>

845
00:23:52.921 --> 00:23:53.910
<v Speaker 1>good morning,</v>

846
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:54.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

847
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.950
<v Speaker 1>top of the day to you and been real happy and made her feel really good and she</v>

848
00:23:58.951 --> 00:24:00.120
<v Speaker 1>could have moved on to,</v>

849
00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:00.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

850
00:24:00.721 --> 00:24:01.830
<v Speaker 1>her job or whatever,</v>

851
00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.090
<v Speaker 1>feeling like really good.</v>

852
00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Instead she runs into the wrong guy and he cracks or knocks her unconscious for</v>

853
00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:08.790
<v Speaker 1>nos for no reason whatsoever.</v>

854
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.140
<v Speaker 1>She hits her head on the concrete.</v>

855
00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.050
<v Speaker 2>I saw it,</v>

856
00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:11.261
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

857
00:24:11.261 --> 00:24:12.880
<v Speaker 2>she's out but horrible.</v>

858
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:13.691
<v Speaker 2>You know what's amazing,</v>

859
00:24:13.691 --> 00:24:13.930
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

860
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:14.561
<v Speaker 2>This is again,</v>

861
00:24:14.561 --> 00:24:16.090
<v Speaker 2>that shit we were talking about in the beginning.</v>

862
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.270
<v Speaker 2>This is the shift that's happening because there was a time in human history</v>

863
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:23.350
<v Speaker 2>when a thug go galloping up behind some young last in the street and knock her</v>

864
00:24:23.351 --> 00:24:27.220
<v Speaker 2>down and like the entire planet doesn't know about it in a matter of like eight</v>

865
00:24:27.221 --> 00:24:28.054
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

866
00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:28.631
<v Speaker 2>you know this,</v>

867
00:24:28.631 --> 00:24:29.260
<v Speaker 2>this is them.</v>

868
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:33.810
<v Speaker 2>This is the incredible time that we're in is that that it's a double edged</v>

869
00:24:33.811 --> 00:24:34.090
<v Speaker 2>sword.</v>

870
00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.320
<v Speaker 2>You see something like that and you,</v>

871
00:24:35.321 --> 00:24:35.590
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

872
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.640
<v Speaker 2>you're either going to be like,</v>

873
00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:37.781
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

874
00:24:37.781 --> 00:24:39.850
<v Speaker 2>this is a fucked up world or living in I,</v>

875
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.450
<v Speaker 2>there's guys we'll just run up behind someone and punch him in the head.</v>

876
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Or the other side of it is like,</v>

877
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.870
<v Speaker 2>fuck in one,</v>

878
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

879
00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.880
<v Speaker 2>a day or two,</v>

880
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.110
<v Speaker 2>this act of violence has been broadcast all over the planet and has created a</v>

881
00:24:53.111 --> 00:24:56.500
<v Speaker 2>situation where people could like talk about how awful it is and how,</v>

882
00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.160
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

883
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.500
<v Speaker 2>how bad that is that people are like that and it,</v>

884
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.470
<v Speaker 2>I think that elevates us a little bit.</v>

885
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it just takes a lot more time than we're used to it because we're used</v>

886
00:25:04.651 --> 00:25:09.390
<v Speaker 1>to like processing power going up in a year and a hard drive space doubling.</v>

887
00:25:09.391 --> 00:25:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

888
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.690
<v Speaker 1>we're used to all these massive improvements and then we,</v>

889
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.240
<v Speaker 1>we don't see that in human nature.</v>

890
00:25:15.241 --> 00:25:16.530
<v Speaker 1>And it's really frustrating,</v>

891
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:17.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

892
00:25:17.221 --> 00:25:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I think that this,</v>

893
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:19.560
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

894
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:19.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

895
00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.460
<v Speaker 1>shifting,</v>

896
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.293
<v Speaker 1>we keep saying,</v>

897
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just more subtle than people would like,</v>

898
00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not as fast as a going from a,</v>

899
00:25:26.351 --> 00:25:29.280
<v Speaker 1>an old tube television to a 55 inch flat screen.</v>

900
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

901
00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:30.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

902
00:25:30.271 --> 00:25:30.601
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

903
00:25:30.601 --> 00:25:34.110
<v Speaker 1>it's something difference between having Dsl and,</v>

904
00:25:34.111 --> 00:25:34.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

905
00:25:34.441 --> 00:25:35.221
<v Speaker 1>having a,</v>

906
00:25:35.221 --> 00:25:35.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

907
00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:36.840
<v Speaker 1>56 k,</v>

908
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:37.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

909
00:25:37.261 --> 00:25:37.411
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

910
00:25:37.411 --> 00:25:37.711
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

911
00:25:37.711 --> 00:25:37.981
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

912
00:25:37.981 --> 00:25:38.281
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

913
00:25:38.281 --> 00:25:39.510
<v Speaker 1>it's too small.</v>

914
00:25:39.511 --> 00:25:40.050
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

915
00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:45.050
<v Speaker 1>so when we still see these versions of the worst case scenarios of human</v>

916
00:25:45.391 --> 00:25:46.224
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

917
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.240
<v Speaker 1>it's shocking to us that they still exist,</v>

918
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.230
<v Speaker 1>but I think the direction is for them to exist less.</v>

919
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.750
<v Speaker 2>It seems like more and more as part of the shift,</v>

920
00:25:56.110 --> 00:26:00.280
<v Speaker 2>things are standing out that aren't shifting more and more so like,</v>

921
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:00.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

922
00:26:00.941 --> 00:26:02.380
<v Speaker 2>like Romney for example,</v>

923
00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:03.170
<v Speaker 2>or like,</v>

924
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:03.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

925
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:04.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

926
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.980
<v Speaker 2>these like crazy fucking like,</v>

927
00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:06.791
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

928
00:26:06.791 --> 00:26:07.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

929
00:26:07.361 --> 00:26:11.830
<v Speaker 2>homophobic antiabortion Republicans talking about my family.</v>

930
00:26:11.831 --> 00:26:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

931
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.930
<v Speaker 2>he's crusty old sons of bitches.</v>

932
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.080
<v Speaker 2>More and more are starting to look like monsters there.</v>

933
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.680
<v Speaker 2>They're starting to look more like freaks a whereas they used to be able to</v>

934
00:26:20.681 --> 00:26:21.280
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

935
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:21.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

936
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.990
<v Speaker 2>they used to be able to turn fucking high powered water hoses on crowds of black</v>

937
00:26:25.991 --> 00:26:26.740
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

938
00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

939
00:26:27.071 --> 00:26:27.761
<v Speaker 2>that without,</v>

940
00:26:27.761 --> 00:26:29.800
<v Speaker 2>without losing their jobs.</v>

941
00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.180
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

942
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

943
00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:32.321
<v Speaker 2>so this,</v>

944
00:26:32.321 --> 00:26:33.640
<v Speaker 2>this shift is like,</v>

945
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.110
<v Speaker 2>but it's really interesting to watch the way that a lot of these crusty old</v>

946
00:26:38.111 --> 00:26:39.610
<v Speaker 2>pundits are reacting to it.</v>

947
00:26:39.611 --> 00:26:39.821
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

948
00:26:39.821 --> 00:26:43.200
<v Speaker 2>They're having the same effect that when they threw water on the witch and the</v>

949
00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 2>wizard of Oz,</v>

950
00:26:44.101 --> 00:26:44.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

951
00:26:44.401 --> 00:26:48.540
<v Speaker 2>that kind of like they're hissing and shrieking and they don't how to deal with</v>

952
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:49.120
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

953
00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.840
<v Speaker 1>What's fascinating to me is that with this,</v>

954
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.630
<v Speaker 1>with this new sort of a understanding of people that were getting,</v>

955
00:26:58.631 --> 00:26:59.371
<v Speaker 1>because of the Internet,</v>

956
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:00.201
<v Speaker 1>there's water all over me.</v>

957
00:27:00.201 --> 00:27:01.150
<v Speaker 1>I spilled coffee on me.</v>

958
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I have a nice shirt and I don't want to ruin it with this new,</v>

959
00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.250
<v Speaker 1>this new understanding that people have of like</v>

960
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:13.270
<v Speaker 1>having the access to these kinds of stories,</v>

961
00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.570
<v Speaker 1>having the access to these horrible stories that are things that are happening</v>

962
00:27:16.571 --> 00:27:17.590
<v Speaker 1>from the Gaza Strip,</v>

963
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:21.160
<v Speaker 1>that this shift that's going on.</v>

964
00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Like as it's happening,</v>

965
00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.940
<v Speaker 1>all these horrific things that still exists in the world,</v>

966
00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:32.170
<v Speaker 1>they seem to escalate almost as if they're worried that something's coming out.</v>

967
00:27:32.171 --> 00:27:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost as if like,</v>

968
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.851
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

969
00:27:33.851 --> 00:27:34.031
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

970
00:27:34.031 --> 00:27:34.630
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

971
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

972
00:27:34.991 --> 00:27:35.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

973
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:35.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

974
00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:40.000
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalism gets even more and more extreme and more and more hate for more</v>

975
00:27:40.001 --> 00:27:43.780
<v Speaker 1>and more crazy and you start getting shit like Dodd hates fags and guys holding</v>

976
00:27:43.781 --> 00:27:44.560
<v Speaker 1>up the fucking sign.</v>

977
00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.300
<v Speaker 1>They have a whole website dedicated to it.</v>

978
00:27:46.301 --> 00:27:47.320
<v Speaker 1>And like all of that,</v>

979
00:27:47.321 --> 00:27:48.940
<v Speaker 1>that the hate that you see with,</v>

980
00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:49.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

981
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.530
<v Speaker 1>w we had um,</v>

982
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.793
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

983
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:57.360
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast we had this conversation with Shane Smith about Pakistan and</v>

984
00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.360
<v Speaker 1>India and the potential for nuclear war and it was one of the scariest</v>

985
00:28:01.361 --> 00:28:04.470
<v Speaker 1>conversations ever because these people like,</v>

986
00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:08.830
<v Speaker 1>it's like almost like a lost state like Pakistan who was talked to him like how</v>

987
00:28:08.831 --> 00:28:12.550
<v Speaker 1>chaotic it is and how chaotic the rulership is and how they hate Indian India</v>

988
00:28:12.551 --> 00:28:16.450
<v Speaker 1>hates them and that different leaders have said they wanted a strap themselves</v>

989
00:28:16.451 --> 00:28:20.020
<v Speaker 1>to a nuclear bomb and go over there and blow the other people up like that.</v>

990
00:28:20.021 --> 00:28:23.770
<v Speaker 1>This all exists at the same time as these,</v>

991
00:28:23.771 --> 00:28:25.720
<v Speaker 1>this new understanding of this new shift.</v>

992
00:28:25.721 --> 00:28:29.680
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like it's this resistance and it's almost like this thing that we</v>

993
00:28:29.681 --> 00:28:31.060
<v Speaker 1>have to rally against,</v>

994
00:28:31.061 --> 00:28:33.280
<v Speaker 1>like the most fucked up part of human nature.</v>

995
00:28:33.281 --> 00:28:37.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like we have to rally against that and that's what Unites People</v>

996
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.570
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] otherwise we'd be too lazy or the ones we have to it,</v>

997
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.980
<v Speaker 1>we would accept mediocrity.</v>

998
00:28:41.981 --> 00:28:46.981
<v Speaker 1>We would accept a certain slow tempo to the evolution of human consciousness.</v>

999
00:28:48.011 --> 00:28:50.650
<v Speaker 1>But this forces it to act.</v>

1000
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I could all the evil and all the fucked up,</v>

1001
00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:58.290
<v Speaker 1>the actions of the world and fucking drone attacks and all this craziness forces</v>

1002
00:28:58.571 --> 00:29:00.400
<v Speaker 1>us to act and think,</v>

1003
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.470
<v Speaker 2>well it's again man.</v>

1004
00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:02.551
<v Speaker 2>Yes I agree.</v>

1005
00:29:02.551 --> 00:29:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Like in,</v>

1006
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:03.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1007
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.420
<v Speaker 2>there's part of me that gets scared cause I feel like that thing gets backed</v>

1008
00:29:06.421 --> 00:29:07.630
<v Speaker 2>into a corner and its size,</v>

1009
00:29:07.631 --> 00:29:08.011
<v Speaker 2>the press,</v>

1010
00:29:08.011 --> 00:29:08.790
<v Speaker 2>the button.</v>

1011
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.770
<v Speaker 2>But I think what's really,</v>

1012
00:29:10.771 --> 00:29:12.930
<v Speaker 2>what's happening is an amplification effect.</v>

1013
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.130
<v Speaker 2>I think acts of violence are becoming</v>

1014
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.260
<v Speaker 2>less but becoming more amplified because we're so,</v>

1015
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.800
<v Speaker 2>we're becoming so much more appalled at the idea of like,</v>

1016
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.341
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1017
00:29:25.341 --> 00:29:25.790
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1018
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.120
<v Speaker 2>the barbarism of war and all this shit that humans do.</v>

1019
00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1020
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:30.561
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

1021
00:29:30.561 --> 00:29:30.920
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1022
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.430
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1023
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:34.430
<v Speaker 2>that what's happening is God hates fags.</v>

1024
00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.570
<v Speaker 2>These people pop up,</v>

1025
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1026
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.430
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens though,</v>

1027
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:41.410
<v Speaker 2>people organized from the Internet and suddenly God hates fags is whenever,</v>

1028
00:29:41.411 --> 00:29:42.244
<v Speaker 2>wherever they go,</v>

1029
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.320
<v Speaker 2>they get surrounded by mobs,</v>

1030
00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:45.400
<v Speaker 2>holding signs.</v>

1031
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:46.840
<v Speaker 2>God hates signs.</v>

1032
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:47.680
<v Speaker 2>God hates this.</v>

1033
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:50.410
<v Speaker 2>God hates that giant signs blocking them out.</v>

1034
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.020
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the hate is getting absorbed.</v>

1035
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:53.740
<v Speaker 2>It's getting up.</v>

1036
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:54.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not working,</v>

1037
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:55.481
<v Speaker 2>it's not working.</v>

1038
00:29:55.481 --> 00:29:59.230
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like it's horrible because it's being broadcast to so many people,</v>

1039
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.940
<v Speaker 2>but the way people are reacting,</v>

1040
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.080
<v Speaker 2>that's what's important.</v>

1041
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:03.190
<v Speaker 2>That's what's important.</v>

1042
00:30:03.191 --> 00:30:04.900
<v Speaker 2>As long as people are reacting,</v>

1043
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.510
<v Speaker 2>you know that's the number one thing and not ignoring it.</v>

1044
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:08.523
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1045
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.600
<v Speaker 2>And as long as people were reacting in whatever way,</v>

1046
00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:13.540
<v Speaker 2>just fucking as simple as the thing is like just tweeting,</v>

1047
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.190
<v Speaker 2>just tweeting something,</v>

1048
00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:17.770
<v Speaker 2>re tweeting something about some of the violence that's happening.</v>

1049
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Just anything to get the information out there and keep that fucking pop</v>

1050
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:22.180
<v Speaker 2>bubbling.</v>

1051
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.260
<v Speaker 2>That's Great Matt.</v>

1052
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:24.191
<v Speaker 2>That'll that,</v>

1053
00:30:24.191 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 2>that will continue to push the warmongers into the periphery and I think that</v>

1054
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:30.083
<v Speaker 2>the the there,</v>

1055
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.530
<v Speaker 2>what just happened with Romney and fucking Obama,</v>

1056
00:30:32.531 --> 00:30:33.010
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1057
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:36.940
<v Speaker 1>well we're lucky we look what's going on with Egypt with a new president decided</v>

1058
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:38.570
<v Speaker 1>to give himself all power.</v>

1059
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1060
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll all powerful,</v>

1061
00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:41.380
<v Speaker 2>but look what's happening.</v>

1062
00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Even their look what's happening.</v>

1063
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not what it is not working.</v>

1064
00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:46.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not fucking working.</v>

1065
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:46.960
<v Speaker 2>That stuff doesn't,</v>

1066
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.490
<v Speaker 2>isn't working in the way it used to work.</v>

1067
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:50.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's the shift.</v>

1068
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:55.300
<v Speaker 2>The mojo that these fucking old white dudes used to have is fading.</v>

1069
00:30:55.301 --> 00:30:56.260
<v Speaker 2>It's fading away,</v>

1070
00:30:56.261 --> 00:30:56.890
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1071
00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:57.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1072
00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.590
<v Speaker 2>it feels like the magic is leaving them,</v>

1073
00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:00.970
<v Speaker 2>which is why it's so beautiful.</v>

1074
00:31:00.971 --> 00:31:05.971
<v Speaker 2>When you watched Karl Rove on Fox News having a little like wizard of Oz style</v>

1075
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.140
<v Speaker 2>man behind the curtain meltdown as he realizes that his evil scheme to try to</v>

1076
00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:12.160
<v Speaker 2>get Romney and the power,</v>

1077
00:31:12.161 --> 00:31:13.240
<v Speaker 2>it didn't fucking work.</v>

1078
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1079
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:14.403
<v Speaker 2>That's cool,</v>

1080
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Danny,</v>

1081
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:15.040
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1082
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:15.720
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1083
00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.500
<v Speaker 1>That's was like,</v>

1084
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.920
<v Speaker 1>no though the numbers are wrong.</v>

1085
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:18.670
<v Speaker 1>The numbers are wrong.</v>

1086
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1087
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:19.811
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't admit it,</v>

1088
00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:20.051
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1089
00:31:20.051 --> 00:31:21.040
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't admit to defeat.</v>

1090
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1091
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.600
<v Speaker 2>It's great to watch and a lot of them are like it.</v>

1092
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.870
<v Speaker 2>That's what's happening is they,</v>

1093
00:31:24.871 --> 00:31:26.560
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to admit they,</v>

1094
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:31.300
<v Speaker 2>they're always upholding the virtues of this country and how we come from</v>

1095
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:32.380
<v Speaker 2>revolution,</v>

1096
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:34.540
<v Speaker 2>but when the real revolution starts happening,</v>

1097
00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:34.930
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1098
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to succeed now.</v>

1099
00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to succeed because the real revolution isn't a revolution where we all</v>

1100
00:31:40.181 --> 00:31:43.010
<v Speaker 2>get to hide in our shacks and collect our fucking gun.</v>

1101
00:31:43.011 --> 00:31:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Look at this flower is photos,</v>

1103
00:31:44.651 --> 00:31:47.920
<v Speaker 1>200,000 Egyptians and they're protesting.</v>

1104
00:31:47.921 --> 00:31:52.921
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy is they're protesting around an ancient obelisk from,</v>

1105
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.053
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1106
00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:55.450
<v Speaker 1>the dynastic Egypt.</v>

1107
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just incredible stone mystery that's covered in hieroglyphs.</v>

1108
00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:03.730
<v Speaker 1>And these people are protesting around it and screaming and yelling that you</v>

1109
00:32:03.731 --> 00:32:06.130
<v Speaker 1>can't have fucking you.</v>

1110
00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:06.371
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1111
00:32:06.371 --> 00:32:06.591
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1112
00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:06.820
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1113
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.361
<v Speaker 1>we're done.</v>

1114
00:32:07.361 --> 00:32:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Like we elected someone.</v>

1115
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.140
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that we're now in a democracy.</v>

1116
00:32:11.141 --> 00:32:13.010
<v Speaker 1>You cannot have this crazy to autograph,</v>

1117
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:14.320
<v Speaker 1>but he wants to,</v>

1118
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.720
<v Speaker 1>he wants to say that he can't get arrested.</v>

1119
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.561
<v Speaker 1>He can't go.</v>

1120
00:32:17.561 --> 00:32:18.331
<v Speaker 1>Jay like,</v>

1121
00:32:18.331 --> 00:32:19.530
<v Speaker 1>can't be treating word.</v>

1122
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:20.141
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

1123
00:32:20.141 --> 00:32:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Didn't work asshole.</v>

1124
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Amazing though that he would want to do that.</v>

1125
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.510
<v Speaker 1>And he says it's because of his opposition.</v>

1126
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Cause his opposition would try to do terrible and Muslim Brotherhood it.</v>

1127
00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:29.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:30.370
<v Speaker 1>he's the Muslim.</v>

1129
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.250
<v Speaker 1>The Muslim Brotherhood is what's in power now.</v>

1130
00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.780
<v Speaker 1>I at least I believe so.</v>

1131
00:32:34.781 --> 00:32:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's how it goes.</v>

1132
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:36.191
<v Speaker 1>For some reason.</v>

1133
00:32:36.191 --> 00:32:36.821
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that,</v>

1134
00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:37.301
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

1150
00:33:01.041 --> 00:33:01.730
<v Speaker 1>dictator.</v>

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.550
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1154
00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:03.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1155
00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:04.940
<v Speaker 2>because this isn't working.</v>

1156
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:05.571
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1157
00:33:05.571 --> 00:33:07.130
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing as like when it's just,</v>

1158
00:33:07.131 --> 00:33:09.890
<v Speaker 2>whenever you start letting freedom out of the bottle,</v>

1159
00:33:09.891 --> 00:33:10.191
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1160
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:11.480
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get the freedom back.</v>

1161
00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:13.070
<v Speaker 2>And once people feel that sense of like,</v>

1162
00:33:13.071 --> 00:33:13.611
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

1163
00:33:13.611 --> 00:33:14.450
<v Speaker 2>if we get together,</v>

1164
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.700
<v Speaker 2>we can change things in a big way.</v>

1165
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1166
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:18.290
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be suddenly they're going to be like,</v>

1167
00:33:18.291 --> 00:33:18.760
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1168
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:19.640
<v Speaker 2>we are okay.</v>

1169
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.650
<v Speaker 2>We'll let you be the new dictator.</v>

1170
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.011
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1171
00:33:22.011 --> 00:33:22.491
<v Speaker 2>no man.</v>

1172
00:33:22.491 --> 00:33:23.324
<v Speaker 2>We've learned.</v>

1173
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.210
<v Speaker 2>We've learned how to change things through the group mind.</v>

1174
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's possible though that moving forward we're ever going to get to</v>

1175
00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:30.970
<v Speaker 1>a position of no.</v>

1176
00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.080
<v Speaker 1>W.</v>

1177
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:32.080
<v Speaker 1>W.</v>

1178
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:32.080
<v Speaker 1>W.</v>

1179
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.280
<v Speaker 1>W we'll have no one above anyone else.</v>

1180
00:33:34.281 --> 00:33:38.480
<v Speaker 1>No one in a position of like president or where they can take executive</v>

1181
00:33:38.481 --> 00:33:39.314
<v Speaker 1>privilege.</v>

1182
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Like Obama did that with that whole gun running thing with that whole,</v>

1183
00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:42.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1184
00:33:42.681 --> 00:33:43.400
<v Speaker 1>that whole,</v>

1185
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1186
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.830
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck they call it fast and furious.</v>

1187
00:33:45.831 --> 00:33:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1188
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Or they sold guns to the Mexican drug lords just to track them.</v>

1189
00:33:50.001 --> 00:33:52.580
<v Speaker 1>And those guns want to being used on American citizens.</v>

1190
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't make any sense.</v>

1191
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.071
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1192
00:33:55.071 --> 00:33:56.390
<v Speaker 1>the store makes no sense.</v>

1193
00:33:56.391 --> 00:33:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Like their story that they would sell guns to the Mexican drug lord,</v>

1194
00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:00.590
<v Speaker 1>so they get tracked the guns.</v>

1195
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.170
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the dumbest fucking ideas I've ever heard in my life.</v>

1196
00:34:03.171 --> 00:34:06.590
<v Speaker 1>You're going to arm them with thousands of guns so that you could track those</v>

1197
00:34:06.591 --> 00:34:06.890
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>

1198
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1199
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you think they got to do with?</v>

1200
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:09.170
<v Speaker 1>Those guns are going to kill people.</v>

1201
00:34:09.171 --> 00:34:10.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the craziest idea of overheard.</v>

1202
00:34:10.711 --> 00:34:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

1203
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:13.430
<v Speaker 1>It almost like that's their excuse.</v>

1204
00:34:13.431 --> 00:34:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what they're going to say and they have it planned out and make it</v>

1205
00:34:16.611 --> 00:34:17.420
<v Speaker 1>look like that's the doing.</v>

1206
00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.550
<v Speaker 1>But really what they're doing is they're profiting on selling guns.</v>

1207
00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Cut that because Dave and they're just playing dumb.</v>

1208
00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1209
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:24.740
<v Speaker 1>that makes a lot more sense to me.</v>

1210
00:34:24.741 --> 00:34:28.100
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense to me that someone would think that selling criminals</v>

1211
00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:31.250
<v Speaker 1>guns is a good idea because then you could track the guns like what the fuck are</v>

1212
00:34:31.251 --> 00:34:32.084
<v Speaker 1>you talking about,</v>

1213
00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:33.323
<v Speaker 2>dude?</v>

1214
00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a problem.</v>

1215
00:34:34.321 --> 00:34:36.180
<v Speaker 2>That shit gets so obscured by,</v>

1216
00:34:36.181 --> 00:34:36.700
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>

1217
00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:41.130
<v Speaker 2>they have so many great ways of like diffusing information of adding information</v>

1218
00:34:41.131 --> 00:34:45.120
<v Speaker 2>to information that's not real of subtracting shit that it becomes that who the</v>

1219
00:34:45.121 --> 00:34:46.090
<v Speaker 2>fuck knows what is right.</v>

1220
00:34:46.091 --> 00:34:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1221
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.960
<v Speaker 1>When it becomes a part of,</v>

1222
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1223
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:53.060
<v Speaker 1>like the government where the president doesn't have to yes.</v>

1224
00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Get tried on this.</v>

1225
00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:54.440
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1226
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:54.670
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1227
00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:56.270
<v Speaker 1>he can invoke this executive privilege.</v>

1228
00:34:56.271 --> 00:34:58.850
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have to testify that's squirrely.</v>

1229
00:34:59.120 --> 00:34:59.661
<v Speaker 1>That shit.</v>

1230
00:34:59.661 --> 00:35:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Squirly never,</v>

1231
00:35:01.341 --> 00:35:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's ever a time where anyone,</v>

1232
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.510
<v Speaker 1>she'd be able to say like,</v>

1233
00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:06.200
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1234
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I had something to do with that whole guns being sold to fucking crazy people</v>

1235
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:12.590
<v Speaker 1>who kill people on a regular basis.</v>

1236
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:13.910
<v Speaker 1>But I don't want to talk about it.</v>

1237
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1238
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.220
<v Speaker 1>you either knew about it or you didn't know that.</v>

1239
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1240
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.201
<v Speaker 2>it's like we hired you,</v>

1241
00:35:17.201 --> 00:35:17.561
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

1242
00:35:17.561 --> 00:35:18.640
<v Speaker 2>You gotta talk about it.</v>

1243
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:19.250
<v Speaker 2>And if you knew</v>

1244
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:20.690
<v Speaker 1>about it and you didn't do anything about it,</v>

1245
00:35:20.691 --> 00:35:21.550
<v Speaker 1>that's incompetence.</v>

1246
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.251
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1247
00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:23.450
<v Speaker 1>If you let that fly,</v>

1248
00:35:23.451 --> 00:35:24.860
<v Speaker 1>if Obama let that fly,</v>

1249
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:27.620
<v Speaker 1>like that's one of the dumbest things a president could ever approve ever.</v>

1250
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:27.881
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1251
00:35:27.881 --> 00:35:28.581
<v Speaker 1>What we should know,</v>

1252
00:35:28.581 --> 00:35:29.840
<v Speaker 1>we should know whether or not,</v>

1253
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.560
<v Speaker 1>especially in a time of a reelection when that was going on and there's just no</v>

1254
00:35:33.561 --> 00:35:35.150
<v Speaker 1>way he shouldn't have to say,</v>

1255
00:35:35.151 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 1>well I thought it was a good idea at the,</v>

1256
00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.230
<v Speaker 1>they assured me these guns</v>

1257
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.040
<v Speaker 2>would this fire,</v>

1258
00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:39.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1259
00:35:39.251 --> 00:35:39.791
<v Speaker 2>there was no,</v>

1260
00:35:39.791 --> 00:35:40.390
<v Speaker 2>there was no,</v>

1261
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:43.360
<v Speaker 2>or like Romney's tax returns like that shit.</v>

1262
00:35:43.361 --> 00:35:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Like that kind of information should be all on the table.</v>

1263
00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:46.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1264
00:35:46.751 --> 00:35:47.650
<v Speaker 2>You should know how much</v>

1265
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.010
<v Speaker 1>she paid in taxes because you know how rich he is.</v>

1266
00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 1>And if you really did weasel it out and then the last couple of years decided to</v>

1267
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:54.690
<v Speaker 1>start paying a lot of taxes to,</v>

1268
00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:55.883
<v Speaker 1>to show,</v>

1269
00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:56.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1270
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.150
<v Speaker 1>so he had it on paper.</v>

1271
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:58.960
<v Speaker 2>If you're running for the office like that.</v>

1272
00:35:58.961 --> 00:35:59.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1273
00:35:59.111 --> 00:36:00.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's that the idea is,</v>

1274
00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:01.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1275
00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.240
<v Speaker 2>to change this fucking businessman,</v>

1276
00:36:04.241 --> 00:36:06.730
<v Speaker 2>president and delight public servant President.</v>

1277
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:07.080
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1278
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.320
<v Speaker 2>that's the idea that you want.</v>

1279
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.330
<v Speaker 2>You want the fucking guy like runs.</v>

1280
00:36:10.331 --> 00:36:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Cost Guard is set.</v>

1281
00:36:11.231 --> 00:36:12.460
<v Speaker 2>Rather than saw this thing on Reddit,</v>

1282
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.530
<v Speaker 2>the guy who runs Costco pays his employees like $18 an hour minimum.</v>

1283
00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.890
<v Speaker 2>They have health insurance and he only makes $500,000 a year.</v>

1284
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.680
<v Speaker 2>This is the guy who fucking runs Costco.</v>

1285
00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Like think about that.</v>

1286
00:36:24.761 --> 00:36:25.121
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

1287
00:36:25.121 --> 00:36:29.320
<v Speaker 2>the guy who runs Walmart is like something out of fucking pink Floyd the wall.</v>

1288
00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:31.300
<v Speaker 2>He's just some a pig man.</v>

1289
00:36:31.301 --> 00:36:32.134
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1290
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Aye.</v>

1291
00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:35.561
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1292
00:36:35.561 --> 00:36:36.460
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1293
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:37.271
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>for Google,</v>

1322
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.690
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to people that work for Google and they tell you what a great</v>

<v Speaker 1>company is to work for it and how well they're treated and like the the</v>

00:37:40.071 --> 00:37:40.904
<v Speaker 1>can operate like that.</v>

1331

<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck this thing is,</v>

<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1336
00:37:46.481 --> 00:37:50.140
<v Speaker 2>you know right away that's all about connectivity and you know right away that</v>

1337
00:37:50.141 --> 00:37:54.820
<v Speaker 2>the feeling you get from like giving more than you're supposed to give is such</v>

1338
00:37:54.821 --> 00:37:57.130
<v Speaker 2>an awesome feeling and that feeling,</v>

1339
00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:00.250
<v Speaker 2>that state of mind where you're putting out more than you're supposed to be</v>

1340
00:38:00.251 --> 00:38:01.060
<v Speaker 2>putting out,</v>

1341
00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:05.290
<v Speaker 2>it seems like in that state of mind is where the bigger ideas come from anyway.</v>

1342
00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:10.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's creating a fertile ground and your consciousness to open up for</v>

1343
00:38:10.811 --> 00:38:12.400
<v Speaker 2>like the big ideas,</v>

1344
00:38:12.401 --> 00:38:13.690
<v Speaker 2>but if you're shut down,</v>

1345
00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:14.800
<v Speaker 2>closed down,</v>

1346
00:38:14.801 --> 00:38:15.760
<v Speaker 2>if you're fucking,</v>

1347
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:16.390
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

1348
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:18.970
<v Speaker 2>if you're just one big human muscle spasm,</v>

1349
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:22.690
<v Speaker 2>pushing all your gyms into the black pit of the your life,</v>

1350
00:38:22.691 --> 00:38:22.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1351
00:38:22.961 --> 00:38:25.210
<v Speaker 2>hoarding and hiding and concealing,</v>

1352
00:38:25.211 --> 00:38:26.620
<v Speaker 2>then you're shut down.</v>

1353
00:38:26.621 --> 00:38:29.800
<v Speaker 2>That's when you turn into Donald Trump with his dumb ass tweets</v>

1442
00:40:54.061 --> 00:40:59.061
<v Speaker 5>like when you like Jizz in a hotel room and like what do you throw the tissue</v>

1472
00:41:56.691 --> 00:41:59.070
<v Speaker 1>like a praying mantis eating a fucking bomb.</v>

1473
00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Pirates slowly starting to bring color back to her face.</v>

1474
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:06.290
<v Speaker 1>God vampires were so close to being awesome man.</v>

1475
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:07.480
<v Speaker 1>If only they want to just,</v>

1476
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:09.470
<v Speaker 1>well that would be the sucky best.</v>

1477
00:42:09.471 --> 00:42:12.440
<v Speaker 1>It would be attached to your dick and balls with like knife,</v>

1478
00:42:12.441 --> 00:42:16.370
<v Speaker 1>like teeth so that you were scared to move so you lay there and terror and you</v>

1479
00:42:16.371 --> 00:42:21.180
<v Speaker 1>would just shoot a load out of pure fear and they would just keep it and they</v>

1480
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't let you pull it out.</v>

1481
00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:24.020
<v Speaker 1>He's done.</v>

1482
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:27.270
<v Speaker 1>You know that feeling like after you come where you want to like somebody</v>

1483
00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:31.540
<v Speaker 1>touches your Dick like hey I like it tickles almost like it's too crazy blow</v>

1484
00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:32.403
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

1485
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:37.490
<v Speaker 1>If a giant sucky booths with teeth is attaching itself to the head of your Dick</v>

1486
00:42:37.491 --> 00:42:40.220
<v Speaker 1>and suck on it and you can't pull your Dick back.</v>

1487
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you do it gets shredded and you feel the Stinger on your neck kind of</v>

1488
00:42:43.521 --> 00:42:44.510
<v Speaker 1>push in a little bit.</v>

1489
00:42:44.511 --> 00:42:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1490
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.170
<v Speaker 1>he started struggling too much.</v>

1491
00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Giant Stinger like a,</v>

1492
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.480
<v Speaker 1>like a scorpion like comes over the top of your head.</v>

1493
00:42:50.481 --> 00:42:54.500
<v Speaker 1>So while you're blowing it wide sucking your Dick,</v>

1494
00:42:54.501 --> 00:42:54.671
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1495
00:42:54.671 --> 00:42:58.880
<v Speaker 1>its Stinger is like attached to your spine and you're looking at in this weird</v>

1496
00:42:58.881 --> 00:42:59.181
<v Speaker 1>cave,</v>

1497
00:42:59.181 --> 00:43:03.320
<v Speaker 1>it's dragged you into it and it's just all like whether dude corpses and maybe a</v>

1498
00:43:03.321 --> 00:43:07.180
<v Speaker 1>couple of guys still alive and the Stinger has two vice like tentacles and</v>

1499
00:43:07.181 --> 00:43:09.200
<v Speaker 1>either side of that clamp down on your neck.</v>

1500
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:12.230
<v Speaker 1>So right before it pushes that sting against your spine.</v>

1501
00:43:12.231 --> 00:43:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Those things get tighter and tighter and you just feel it,</v>

1502
00:43:14.711 --> 00:43:15.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1503
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:16.041
<v Speaker 1>don't go anywhere.</v>

1504
00:43:16.041 --> 00:43:19.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm sucking your deck and this is going to go on for five years.</v>

1505
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Giant teeth.</v>

1506
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:25.940
<v Speaker 1>I never pictured them at like that.</v>

1507
00:43:25.941 --> 00:43:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Like when I think of a sack of us,</v>

1508
00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I think a world of Warcraft is fucking hot chick with like leather boots,</v>

1509
00:43:30.861 --> 00:43:34.100
<v Speaker 1>like a dominatrix or the little whip that like you know,</v>

1510
00:43:34.101 --> 00:43:35.090
<v Speaker 1>over fuck to you.</v>

1511
00:43:35.091 --> 00:43:39.320
<v Speaker 1>But if it starts out as a beautiful girl and then you realize in the middle of</v>

1512
00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:40.210
<v Speaker 1>having sex with it,</v>

1513
00:43:40.211 --> 00:43:42.800
<v Speaker 1>like sort of like Jack Nicholson when he was making out with that lady and the</v>

1514
00:43:42.801 --> 00:43:46.460
<v Speaker 1>shining and then all sudden she was like a hundred years old with cancer all</v>

1515
00:43:46.461 --> 00:43:47.294
<v Speaker 1>over her back.</v>

1516
00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's how it gets cone and maybe it looks like Rose McGowan and then you</v>

1517
00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:51.920
<v Speaker 1>move in for the kill.</v>

1518
00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.190
<v Speaker 1>You start squeezing her ass and all of a sudden she morphs into this thing.</v>

1519
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:56.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1520
00:43:56.361 --> 00:43:57.051
<v Speaker 1>just your,</v>

1521
00:43:57.051 --> 00:43:57.800
<v Speaker 1>you can't move.</v>

1522
00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why I have to hold your neck and then it starts talking to you</v>

1523
00:44:00.111 --> 00:44:00.430
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1524
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1525
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:01.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the story.</v>

1526
00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Fucking wives man.</v>

1527
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.730
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1528
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:06.200
<v Speaker 1>And it always starts off like that.</v>

1529
00:44:06.201 --> 00:44:06.831
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know,</v>

1530
00:44:06.831 --> 00:44:10.520
<v Speaker 1>you're over your clamped in to some kind of that to me it's a symbol,</v>

1531
00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:10.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1532
00:44:10.821 --> 00:44:11.301
<v Speaker 1>it's like that.</v>

1533
00:44:11.301 --> 00:44:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh the sirens that like seeing in the sailors crashed their ships on the island</v>

1534
00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:16.850
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1535
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:18.590
<v Speaker 1>it's all the same fucking story.</v>

1536
00:44:18.591 --> 00:44:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1537
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.930
<v Speaker 1>How come guys don't see those in prison?</v>

1538
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1539
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.980
<v Speaker 1>you know some girl with like fake girl with a key that's going to let you out.</v>

1540
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

1541
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.830
<v Speaker 1>you never hear of like crazy hallucinations in prison?</v>

1542
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:29.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

1543
00:44:29.721 --> 00:44:29.861
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1544
00:44:29.861 --> 00:44:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure there's some pretty crazy illuminations in prison.</v>

1545
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:32.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1546
00:44:32.821 --> 00:44:35.480
<v Speaker 1>But I mean like that kind of reoccurring theme of like a,</v>

1547
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.050
<v Speaker 1>someone with a light near the rock's going,</v>

1548
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:39.000
<v Speaker 1>come on over here.</v>

1549
00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I own a sailor's smashed into the rock.</v>

1550
00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:45.390
<v Speaker 5>So the prison harpies there's prison harpies man I called trainees.</v>

1551
00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:49.140
<v Speaker 5>We had 'em</v>

1552
00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Victor Conte on,</v>

1553
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:53.790
<v Speaker 1>he was telling us about his time in a minimum security prison where you were</v>

1554
00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:55.740
<v Speaker 1>allowed like really allowed to leave whenever you want.</v>

1555
00:44:55.741 --> 00:44:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Like people would come and pick up their,</v>

1556
00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:00.330
<v Speaker 1>their family like Elana stay there a certain amount of time you could get like</v>

1557
00:45:00.331 --> 00:45:01.164
<v Speaker 1>passes to leave.</v>

1558
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.540
<v Speaker 1>He said that the security guards,</v>

1559
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.160
<v Speaker 1>like there was a girl security guard.</v>

1560
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.410
<v Speaker 1>They would make money prostituting herself.</v>

1561
00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1562
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Like you could go get some head from the security guard.</v>

1563
00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:11.870
<v Speaker 1>She made a lot of extra money that way.</v>

1564
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:12.820
<v Speaker 5>It makes sense to me.</v>

1565
00:45:12.821 --> 00:45:14.230
<v Speaker 5>These poor bastard Italian,</v>

1566
00:45:14.231 --> 00:45:15.520
<v Speaker 5>but not going to let these guys,</v>

1567
00:45:15.521 --> 00:45:16.211
<v Speaker 5>fuck man.</v>

1568
00:45:16.211 --> 00:45:17.530
<v Speaker 5>That's why there's so many problems.</v>

1569
00:45:17.531 --> 00:45:17.650
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1570
00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:18.251
<v Speaker 5>it's awesome,</v>

1571
00:45:18.251 --> 00:45:18.431
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1572
00:45:18.431 --> 00:45:20.350
<v Speaker 5>I would add that to the God damn constitution.</v>

1573
00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:20.891
<v Speaker 5>If you're in prison,</v>

1574
00:45:20.891 --> 00:45:22.660
<v Speaker 5>you get a blow job a month just to,</v>

1575
00:45:22.661 --> 00:45:23.020

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:25.960
<v Speaker 1>you got to be around some crazy fucking people that want to kill women.</v>

1577
00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:30.080
<v Speaker 1>What if you're around some really crazy serial murderer character and someone's</v>

1578
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:30.923
<v Speaker 1>got to suck his dick?</v>

1579
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Who's job should that be?</v>

1580
00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

1581
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.550
<v Speaker 5>another serial murderer.</v>

1582
00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.170
<v Speaker 5>A guy.</v>

1583
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.441
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1584
00:45:36.441 --> 00:45:36.891
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

1585
00:45:36.891 --> 00:45:37.191
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

1586
00:45:37.191 --> 00:45:37.571
<v Speaker 5>who cares?</v>

1587
00:45:37.571 --> 00:45:38.960
<v Speaker 5>This is a fucking hole in the wall.</v>

1588
00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.250
<v Speaker 5>You know what's on the other end?</v>

1589
00:45:40.251 --> 00:45:43.850
<v Speaker 5>It's like you make it very like dad's guys would bite each other's dicks off.</v>

1590
00:45:43.851 --> 00:45:46.130
<v Speaker 5>There's no way you fucking Defang them.</v>

1591
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.920
<v Speaker 5>You can't Defang a guy cause he's on the other end.</v>

1592
00:45:48.921 --> 00:45:49.830
<v Speaker 5>If he grabs a hold of it,</v>

1593
00:45:49.831 --> 00:45:52.070
<v Speaker 5>she said he just pulls it out with his hands.</v>

1594
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:53.870
<v Speaker 5>I haven't perfected this system yet,</v>

1595
00:45:53.871 --> 00:45:54.740
<v Speaker 5>but I'm working on it.</v>

1596
00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.810
<v Speaker 5>But because if he couldn't blow you with his hands,</v>

1597
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:59.500
<v Speaker 1>be an inferior blowjob moving through a hole in the wall,</v>

1598
00:45:59.501 --> 00:45:59.940
<v Speaker 1>you can feel like,</v>

1599
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:00.773
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1600
00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:03.850
<v Speaker 5>Let me just take it down from this disgusting level it's gotten.</v>

1601
00:46:03.851 --> 00:46:06.630
<v Speaker 5>If you heard about the new program where they give prisoners kittens,</v>

1602
00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:07.411
<v Speaker 5>if you heard about this.</v>

1603
00:46:07.411 --> 00:46:07.631
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1604
00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:08.190
<v Speaker 5>I have heard.</v>

1605
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:09.160
<v Speaker 5>And it makes them like,</v>

1606
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:10.920
<v Speaker 5>what's that?</v>

1607
00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:11.910
<v Speaker 5>What's a good way a cat?</v>

1608
00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:16.050
<v Speaker 5>And so sat down to two of my pets.</v>

1609
00:46:16.051 --> 00:46:17.340
<v Speaker 5>I have one left dude.</v>

1610
00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:17.600
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1611
00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:17.851
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1612
00:46:17.851 --> 00:46:18.481
<v Speaker 5>it's really cool.</v>

1613
00:46:18.481 --> 00:46:18.901
<v Speaker 5>But it's like,</v>

1614
00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:23.640
<v Speaker 5>just like having these fucking cats is changing the prisoner's behavior and</v>

1615
00:46:23.641 --> 00:46:24.570
<v Speaker 5>massive ways,</v>

1616
00:46:24.571 --> 00:46:24.781
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1617
00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:26.760
<v Speaker 5>because they know that if they get in fights,</v>

1618
00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:30.040
<v Speaker 5>they lose their cat so they don't want to fucking lose the cat.</v>

1619
00:46:30.041 --> 00:46:30.874
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>

1620
00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.210
<v Speaker 5>it creates this like it,</v>

1621
00:46:32.211 --> 00:46:33.570
<v Speaker 5>it adds piece.</v>

1622
00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.310
<v Speaker 5>You've got to bring love into prison.</v>

1623
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:36.190
<v Speaker 5>That's a problem,</v>

1624
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.451
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1625
00:46:36.451 --> 00:46:37.770
<v Speaker 5>Love is the answer.</v>

1626
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:39.063
<v Speaker 5>Brother.</v>

1627
00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:47.190
<v Speaker 5>With a little fucking kitten can transform some hardcore thug and to somebody</v>

1628
00:46:47.191 --> 00:46:47.401
<v Speaker 5>who's like,</v>

1629
00:46:47.401 --> 00:46:47.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1630
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:50.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to fight because princess is back in the saddle and I don't want</v>

1631
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:51.474
<v Speaker 5>to lose her.</v>

1632
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:52.201
<v Speaker 5>That's love,</v>

1633
00:46:52.201 --> 00:46:52.471
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1634
00:46:52.471 --> 00:46:53.510
<v Speaker 5>That's the most powerful thing.</v>

1635
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.900
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot more powerful than being like,</v>

1636
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.110
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1637
00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:56.130
<v Speaker 5>we'll put you in solitary.</v>

1638
00:46:56.131 --> 00:46:56.791
<v Speaker 5>Can Fuck you.</v>

1639
00:46:56.791 --> 00:46:57.270
<v Speaker 5>Fuck up.</v>

1640
00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:00.420
<v Speaker 5>How many of these guys are actually fucking the cat though a lot.</v>

1641
00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.351
<v Speaker 5>Most of them,</v>

1642
00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:02.184
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1643
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:02.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1644
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:05.340
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the cat is like a special attachment.</v>

1645
00:47:05.341 --> 00:47:09.930
<v Speaker 5>When you stick your Dick in its ass and alarm goes off you to the RFID chip,</v>

1646
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:11.910
<v Speaker 5>you push,</v>

1647
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:14.640
<v Speaker 5>you push the button when your cock to try to fuck a cat,</v>

1648
00:47:14.641 --> 00:47:15.770
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to have a fucking cat.</v>

1649
00:47:15.771 --> 00:47:18.480
<v Speaker 5>It's like they probably do an operation on the cap where there's like,</v>

1650
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:22.080
<v Speaker 5>there's like a little toggle and as long as the poops going that way it passes</v>

1651
00:47:22.081 --> 00:47:22.620
<v Speaker 5>the toggle.</v>

1652
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.453
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't go off.</v>

1653
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:24.900
<v Speaker 5>But if a dick goes in the other way,</v>

1654
00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:29.920
<v Speaker 5>click it hits the switch and then the RFID chips signals the alarm as a cat.</v>

1655
00:47:29.921 --> 00:47:31.270
<v Speaker 5>That's a fleshlight in prison.</v>

1656
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.231
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1657
00:47:32.231 --> 00:47:33.064
<v Speaker 5>they would fuck that guy.</v>

1658
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:34.260
<v Speaker 5>I think prisoners,</v>

1659
00:47:34.261 --> 00:47:35.230
<v Speaker 5>staff flashlights,</v>

1660
00:47:35.231 --> 00:47:35.441
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1661
00:47:35.441 --> 00:47:39.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why we're acting like it's going to do anything good to like try to</v>

1662
00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:41.660
<v Speaker 5>like change someones libido.</v>

1663
00:47:41.661 --> 00:47:42.850
<v Speaker 5>Who's in a cage.</v>

1664
00:47:42.851 --> 00:47:46.930
<v Speaker 5>Like that's not going to add happiness to a prison or peacefulness.</v>

1665
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:48.850
<v Speaker 5>Everyone you look at these prison riots are like,</v>

1666
00:47:48.851 --> 00:47:50.610
<v Speaker 5>why are they writing to?</v>

1667
00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:51.011
<v Speaker 5>They're not,</v>

1668
00:47:51.011 --> 00:47:51.940
<v Speaker 5>they're not fucking,</v>

1669
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.750
<v Speaker 5>these guys have so much testosterone and then you're not letting them fuck.</v>

1670
00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:55.981
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1671
00:47:55.981 --> 00:47:56.530
<v Speaker 5>but even if you</v>

1672
00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:57.363
<v Speaker 1>give him flashlights,</v>

1673
00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:58.810
<v Speaker 1>so it's not as good as raping a guy.</v>

1674
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.300
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the fun for them.</v>

1675
00:48:01.301 --> 00:48:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it's holding someone down and,</v>

1676
00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.600
<v Speaker 1>and getting that man pussy,</v>

1677
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.231
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1678
00:48:05.231 --> 00:48:05.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean when,</v>

1679
00:48:05.811 --> 00:48:06.940
<v Speaker 1>when they're turning out to each other,</v>

1680
00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:08.560
<v Speaker 1>that's part of what they're doing.</v>

1681
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1682
00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:09.643
<v Speaker 5>No disagree.</v>

1683
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:14.950
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] way you phrase that.</v>

1684
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.090
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to be punched in the face and a flashlight.</v>

1685
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.171

<v Speaker 5>those guys</v>

1848
00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:32.930
<v Speaker 3>gamma's that you have to pay for the funeral and then it's really expensive and</v>

1849
00:51:32.931 --> 00:51:36.090
<v Speaker 3>you know you have to pay a lot of money for a casket and you have to embalm the</v>

1850
00:51:36.091 --> 00:51:36.810
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

1851

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.010

1865
00:51:58.511 --> 00:51:59.171
<v Speaker 5>Do you know if you,</v>

1866
00:51:59.171 --> 00:52:00.430
<v Speaker 5>if you don't have a will,</v>

1867
00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.230
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm not 100% sure,</v>

1868
00:52:02.231 --> 00:52:04.180
<v Speaker 5>but like the government just takes all your shit.</v>

1869
00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:07.060
<v Speaker 5>Even if you have living parents and another state.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Go ahead.</v>

1891
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:28.470
<v Speaker 3>We don't have much time left in this podcast,</v>

1892
00:52:28.471 --> 00:52:30.060
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately because,</v>

1893
00:52:30.061 --> 00:52:30.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1894

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:34.123
<v Speaker 5>Where's it at side?</v>

1897
00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:35.750
<v Speaker 5>Because that highway was fucked.</v>

1898
00:52:35.751 --> 00:52:37.040
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you got my text message.</v>

1899
00:52:37.041 --> 00:52:38.780
<v Speaker 5>There was like five cars,</v>

1900
00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:39.501
<v Speaker 5>all cop cars.</v>

1901
00:52:39.501 --> 00:52:42.410
<v Speaker 5>It seemed like that guy in a car accident and the whole freeway's closed.</v>

1902
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:43.303
<v Speaker 3>Which freeway?</v>

1903
00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:44.180
<v Speaker 3>One one.</v>

1904
00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:44.451
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

00:52:44.451 --> 00:52:45.284
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

1906
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Woopsies oopsy daisy.</v>

1907
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.741
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1908
00:52:48.741 --> 00:52:49.574
<v Speaker 3>I'll try,</v>

1909
00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:50.563
<v Speaker 3>I'll try.</v>

1910
00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:51.643
<v Speaker 3>I'll try to make it,</v>

1911
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:52.790
<v Speaker 3>but if I don't make it,</v>

1912
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.710
<v Speaker 3>don't really give a fuck.</v>

1913
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:58.240
<v Speaker 3>I hate to leave anybody hanging.</v>

1914
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1915
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.731
<v Speaker 5>The more,</v>

1916
00:52:58.731 --> 00:53:01.130
<v Speaker 5>the more I think about yesterday's podcast,</v>

1917
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:05.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I want to say say it the more I think that guy is tweaker.</v>

1918
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.730
<v Speaker 3>You think so?</v>

1919
00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1920
00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.610
<v Speaker 3>Most people thought that a lot of people who,</v>

1921
00:53:09.611 --> 00:53:09.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1922
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:13.660
<v Speaker 3>listen then thought he was off and that he would like contradict himself.</v>

1923
00:53:13.661 --> 00:53:16.720
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that he knew so much about those drugs,</v>

1924
00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:18.280
<v Speaker 3>but yet there was a,</v>

1925
00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:18.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1926
00:53:18.641 --> 00:53:22.360
<v Speaker 3>we read on Gizmodo that they didn't cite sources,</v>

1927
00:53:22.361 --> 00:53:22.871
<v Speaker 3>but they said,</v>

1928
00:53:22.871 --> 00:53:23.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1929
00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:24.400
<v Speaker 3>sources close to him.</v>

1930
00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:28.090
<v Speaker 3>Say that he's always been interested in finding drugs that make women's sexual.</v>

1931
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:32.150
<v Speaker 3>It kinda goes along with the whole 67 year old guy,</v>

1932
00:53:32.151 --> 00:53:33.490
<v Speaker 3>a 20 year old girlfriend thing.</v>

1933
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:34.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1934
00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:35.560
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like a dude who's just,</v>

1935
00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.513
<v Speaker 3>that's his thing.</v>

1936
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:38.793
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1937
00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:39.441
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>

1938
00:53:39.441 --> 00:53:40.300
<v Speaker 3>he claims not,</v>

1939
00:53:40.301 --> 00:53:40.930
<v Speaker 3>but then he ought,</v>

1940
00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:42.880
<v Speaker 3>but he knows so much about that man.</v>

1941
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:47.350
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck do you know so much about bath salts and MDPV and these different</v>

1942
00:53:47.351 --> 00:53:52.030
<v Speaker 3>hypersexual compounds and how could he tell us the exact chemical composition of</v>

1943
00:53:52.031 --> 00:53:52.120
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

1944
00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:52.953
<v Speaker 3>Remember when he told us?</v>

1945
00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:54.220
<v Speaker 3>But it wouldn't actually was,</v>

1946
00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.770
<v Speaker 3>why would you say that unless you have great interest in it and why would you</v>

1947
00:53:56.771 --> 00:53:57.190
<v Speaker 3>have graded?</v>

1948
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:58.330
<v Speaker 3>And then the other thing was saying like,</v>

1949
00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:59.770
<v Speaker 3>I have to be addicted.</v>

1950
00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:00.911
<v Speaker 3>It can't do that.</v>

1951
00:54:00.911 --> 00:54:02.980
<v Speaker 3>Then I would be on it right now and I sound like I don't on it.</v>

1952
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:04.660
<v Speaker 3>He might be on it right now,</v>

1953
00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:08.620
<v Speaker 3>but I don't necessarily think that a strong willed man like that has to be</v>

1954
00:54:08.621 --> 00:54:09.160
<v Speaker 3>addicted to.</v>

1955
00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:13.060
<v Speaker 3>So it's supposedly really hypersexual.</v>

1956
00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:14.253
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

1957
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:15.460
<v Speaker 3>But I figured that if you're a gun,</v>

1958
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:15.780
<v Speaker 3>a gun,</v>

1959
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:16.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm like God,</v>

1960
00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:17.203
<v Speaker 3>like Mcafee,</v>

1961
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:18.170
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1962
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:18.551
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1963
00:54:18.551 --> 00:54:19.780
<v Speaker 3>he created this business.</v>

1964
00:54:19.781 --> 00:54:21.520
<v Speaker 3>He's like a very headstrong guy,</v>

1965
00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:22.810
<v Speaker 3>very powerful guy.</v>

1966
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:27.280
<v Speaker 3>I kind of like that could probably quit of really fucking dangerous drug for a</v>

1967
00:54:27.281 --> 00:54:27.761
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>

1968
00:54:27.761 --> 00:54:28.270
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1969
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.571
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1970
00:54:28.571 --> 00:54:29.020
<v Speaker 3>he could,</v>

1971
00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:29.391
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1972
00:54:29.391 --> 00:54:31.930
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to tell when someone lies about anything.</v>

1973
00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:36.730
<v Speaker 3>If they lie about anything or don't or not completely honest about anything,</v>

1974
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.650
<v Speaker 3>you immediately have to look at the whole thing and go,</v>

1975
00:54:38.651 --> 00:54:38.891
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1976
00:54:38.891 --> 00:54:42.460
<v Speaker 3>if he's not telling the truth about doing those drugs and how can I listen to</v>

1977
00:54:42.461 --> 00:54:43.000
<v Speaker 3>all the other stuff?</v>

1978
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:43.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1979
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:44.333
<v Speaker 3>It sounds,</v>

1980
00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:48.580
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like it's a lot of who the fuck knows what to believe at that at that</v>

1981
00:54:48.581 --> 00:54:49.414
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

1982
00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:52.480
<v Speaker 5>and the fact that he has no charges,</v>

1983
00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:55.200
<v Speaker 5>nothing like on record like that.</v>

1984
00:54:55.201 --> 00:54:57.190
<v Speaker 5>Like there's no warrant for his arrest.</v>

1985
00:54:57.191 --> 00:54:58.150
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing,</v>

1986
00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:01.300
<v Speaker 5>it kind of made me think that he was just super paranoid.</v>

1987
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.971
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1988
00:55:01.971 --> 00:55:02.810
<v Speaker 3>it could be that.</v>

1989
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.830
<v Speaker 3>It could be that,</v>

1990
00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:04.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1991
00:55:04.191 --> 00:55:04.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1992
00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:08.930
<v Speaker 3>I told you there was that story that someone had said that he thought that there</v>

1993
00:55:08.931 --> 00:55:11.690
<v Speaker 3>was people outside and he had a conversation.</v>

1994
00:55:11.691 --> 00:55:12.290
<v Speaker 3>I heard this,</v>

1995
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:13.070
<v Speaker 3>I heard this,</v>

1996
00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:15.650
<v Speaker 3>this you can get on wired this,</v>

1997
00:55:15.651 --> 00:55:15.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1998
00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:16.693
<v Speaker 3>discussion.</v>

1999
00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:17.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2000
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:18.261
<v Speaker 3>it's just something,</v>

2001
00:55:18.261 --> 00:55:18.951
<v Speaker 3>hold on a second,</v>

2002
00:55:18.951 --> 00:55:22.670
<v Speaker 3>I'll find it because maybe we could pull it up and it's audio anyway.</v>

2003
00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:23.960
<v Speaker 3>A wired,</v>

2004
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:25.330
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2008
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Crazy audio.</v>

2009
00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.633
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2010
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:36.750
<v Speaker 3>but he was talking about how the,</v>

2011
00:55:36.751 --> 00:55:40.020
<v Speaker 3>there was these people and they were,</v>

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:40.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2013
00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.910
<v Speaker 3>they were standing there,</v>

2014
00:55:41.911 --> 00:55:45.390
<v Speaker 3>they were like military people and they were standing there and they didn't say</v>

2015
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:46.253
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

2016
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:49.350
<v Speaker 3>They just just stood there and he wouldn't move.</v>

2017
00:55:49.351 --> 00:55:50.760
<v Speaker 3>And so he just stood there too.</v>

2018
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.300
<v Speaker 3>And they slowly went away like after hours and hours.</v>

2019
00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:55.411
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2020
00:55:55.411 --> 00:55:56.550
<v Speaker 3>so he was like standing.</v>

2021
00:55:56.551 --> 00:55:58.140
<v Speaker 3>Then he was talking about like how,</v>

2022
00:55:58.350 --> 00:55:59.460
<v Speaker 3>how much his,</v>

2023
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:00.803
<v Speaker 3>his uh,</v>

2024
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:03.630
<v Speaker 3>arm hurt because he was like leaning up against this wall,</v>

2025
00:56:03.631 --> 00:56:04.740
<v Speaker 3>but he couldn't move.</v>

2026
00:56:04.741 --> 00:56:05.221
<v Speaker 3>He moved.</v>

2027
00:56:05.221 --> 00:56:07.160
<v Speaker 3>They would shoot him hand.</v>

2028
00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:08.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2029
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.410
<v Speaker 3>But there'll be more saying there's no footprints there.</v>

2030
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:12.840
<v Speaker 3>There's like he's</v>

2031
00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:15.430
<v Speaker 5>was that house that somebody posted on your message board?</v>

2032
00:56:15.431 --> 00:56:16.420
<v Speaker 5>The guy that died,</v>

2033
00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.450
<v Speaker 5>like it was like a shack that had an American flag in it.</v>

2034
00:56:19.451 --> 00:56:19.961
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know.</v>

2035
00:56:19.961 --> 00:56:20.230
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2036
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:21.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know whose house that was.</v>

2037
00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:22.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2038
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:24.510
<v Speaker 3>Does it that it was what it was supposed to.</v>

2039
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:25.810
<v Speaker 5>I thought that I thought the guy,</v>

2040
00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.860
<v Speaker 5>somebody that died because it was like this.</v>

2041
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:29.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean it looked like a shack.</v>

2042
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:31.700
<v Speaker 5>Like it just looked like a junkyard shack,</v>

2043
00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:32.563
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2044
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:33.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2045
00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:34.290
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking,</v>

2046
00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:35.573
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

2047
00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:36.211
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2048
00:56:36.211 --> 00:56:36.810
<v Speaker 5>I could,</v>

2049
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:39.720
<v Speaker 5>that was an interesting podcast cause I kept on thinking about it after,</v>

2050
00:56:39.721 --> 00:56:40.501
<v Speaker 5>when I got home.</v>

2051
00:56:40.501 --> 00:56:42.210
<v Speaker 5>And then the more I thought about it was just like,</v>

2052
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2053
00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:44.520
<v Speaker 5>this just seems like something's not right.</v>

2054
00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:45.300
<v Speaker 5>It was cool</v>

2055
00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:45.750
<v Speaker 3>that he,</v>

2056
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:46.171
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2057
00:56:46.171 --> 00:56:46.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2058
00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:47.423

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2061
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:49.440
<v Speaker 3>it was cool that he did it.</v>

2062
00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:51.500
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I'm just getting trolled though.</v>

2063
00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.240
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's what it seems like.</v>

2064
00:56:53.241 --> 00:56:53.601
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't,</v>

2065
00:56:53.601 --> 00:56:56.540
<v Speaker 5>it seems like smells like a big old troll.</v>

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.590
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate the fact that the guy was willing to talk to us.</v>

2090
00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:46.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2091
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:50.600
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty interesting to be able to talk to someone who's in this a crazy</v>

2092
00:57:50.601 --> 00:57:51.250
<v Speaker 3>scenario.</v>

2095
00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:55.170
<v Speaker 5>He was a crazy person and a crazy scenario.</v>

2096
00:57:55.171 --> 00:57:56.650
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like he's an eccentric,</v>

2097
00:57:56.651 --> 00:57:57.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2100
00:57:58.781 --> 00:58:02.920
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of what it takes to become some super millionaire type character</v>

2101
00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:03.913
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

00:58:05.341 --> 00:58:05.731
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing,</v>

2106
00:58:05.731 --> 00:58:05.941

2109
00:58:08.581 --> 00:58:09.750
<v Speaker 5>but you gotta be able to come back.</v>

2113
00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.380

00:58:20.001 --> 00:58:22.460
<v Speaker 3>It's so hunters Thompson ask like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:37.310
<v Speaker 3>He went Pharrel's amazing.</v>

2133
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:42.740

2134
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.131
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2135
00:58:43.131 --> 00:58:44.270
<v Speaker 3>I simply will not pay.</v>

2136
00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:44.901
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2137

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2140
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:49.190
<v Speaker 3>I will spend $10 million to fight it,</v>

2141
00:58:49.191 --> 00:58:50.024
<v Speaker 3>to give them nothing.</v>

2142
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:51.380
<v Speaker 3>What are the lawsuits about?</v>

2143
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:51.681
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2144
00:58:51.681 --> 00:58:52.850
<v Speaker 3>one of them was about,</v>

2145
00:58:52.851 --> 00:58:53.840
<v Speaker 3>he had this,</v>

2146
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:55.370
<v Speaker 3>he was connected to this,</v>

2147
00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:56.283
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2148
00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:59.180
<v Speaker 3>sort of a sport where they would fly.</v>

2149
00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:02.570
<v Speaker 3>These looked like motorcycles that are attached to kite wings.</v>

2150
00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:03.651
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy.</v>

2151
00:59:03.651 --> 00:59:04.700
<v Speaker 3>And they're really maneuverable.</v>

2152
00:59:04.701 --> 00:59:05.930
<v Speaker 3>Apparently what they would do,</v>

2153
00:59:05.931 --> 00:59:07.730
<v Speaker 3>these low altitude,</v>

2154
00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:08.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2155
00:59:08.061 --> 00:59:10.010
<v Speaker 3>not even altitude low off,</v>

2156
00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean basically just very close to the ground.</v>

2157
00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:17.450
<v Speaker 3>They would do these things like acrobatics spin around on these fucking plants.</v>

2158
00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Whole swing crashed and died.</v>

2159
00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:19.310
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2160
00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:24.240
<v Speaker 3>And so he got sued and that's when he decided apparently to move to beliefs,</v>

2161
00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:28.020
<v Speaker 3>you just loaded up his truck and he moved to bevel a just get the fuck out.</v>

2162
00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:32.490
<v Speaker 3>And I guess Billy's won't extradite him or something.</v>

2163
00:59:32.491 --> 00:59:33.324
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it works,</v>

2164
00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.980
<v Speaker 3>but if,</v>

2165
00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:38.370
<v Speaker 3>if he apparently says that if he loses the court cases,</v>

2166
00:59:38.371 --> 00:59:38.941
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

2167
00:59:38.941 --> 00:59:40.140
<v Speaker 3>They'll just come and take his money.</v>

2168
00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>

2169
00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:41.911
<v Speaker 3>if you lose,</v>

2170
00:59:41.911 --> 00:59:42.744
<v Speaker 3>you lose.</v>

2171
00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:46.500
<v Speaker 3>But that he doesn't believe that he's guilty because he wasn't even driving it.</v>

2172
00:59:46.501 --> 00:59:47.500
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't a response.</v>

2173
00:59:47.501 --> 00:59:49.290
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't responsible for maintaining it.</v>

2174
00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.070
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't his,</v>

2175
00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:50.820
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2176
00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:51.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like it wasn't his fault.</v>

2177
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:53.220
<v Speaker 3>This guy died like this,</v>

2178
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:57.660
<v Speaker 3>but apparently he was like working hard to promote this crazy sort of a sport.</v>

2179
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.000
<v Speaker 3>John McAfee,</v>

2180
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.920
<v Speaker 8>who was calling to tell me that the police were closing in.</v>

2181
01:00:03.921 --> 01:00:08.180
<v Speaker 8>He had spent the night and an undisclosed house in Belize sleeping on a bed</v>

2182
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:11.690
<v Speaker 8>infested with lice and that he felt that the end was near,</v>

2183
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.820
<v Speaker 8>that they would arrest him at any minute,</v>

2184
01:00:13.821 --> 01:00:16.970
<v Speaker 8>but he was not going to surrender because he was convinced that they would kill</v>

2185
01:00:16.971 --> 01:00:17.804
<v Speaker 8>him.</v>

2186
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:21.650
<v Speaker 8>I've been following McAfee's case and believes for the past six months,</v>

2187
01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:26.651
<v Speaker 8>ever since April 30th when the police raided him and accused him of being a drug</v>

2188
01:00:26.871 --> 01:00:29.960
<v Speaker 8>trafficker and possessing illegal firearms.</v>

2189
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:30.920
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

2190
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.360
<v Speaker 8>over those six months,</v>

2191
01:00:32.361 --> 01:00:36.620
<v Speaker 8>I've spent weeks and Billy's and interviewed McAfee both in person and on the</v>

2192
01:00:36.621 --> 01:00:37.251
<v Speaker 8>telephone,</v>

2193
01:00:37.251 --> 01:00:39.410
<v Speaker 8>probably over a hundred hours of interviews.</v>

2194
01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.860
<v Speaker 8>And I can say without a doubt that he is a very complex person,</v>

2195
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:46.610
<v Speaker 8>but whether or not is a murderer is yet to be seen.</v>

2196
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:51.260
<v Speaker 8>I recorded McAfee's phone calls to me this morning with his permission.</v>

2197
01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:53.240
<v Speaker 8>And what follows are those calls,</v>

2198
01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.840
<v Speaker 5>one of the charges against you is that you're a psychopath.</v>

2199
01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.090
<v Speaker 5>What do you have to say about Tom?</v>

2200
01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.090
<v Speaker 9>I would not be confidence or to uh,</v>

2201
01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:07.390
<v Speaker 9>to comment on it,</v>

2202
01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:08.973
<v Speaker 9>yes or no,</v>

2203
01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:13.890
<v Speaker 9>then I either one if I were a psychopath would be irrelevant.</v>

2204
01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.570
<v Speaker 9>I don't think I'm a psychopath.</v>

2205
01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:16.733
<v Speaker 9>I liked people.</v>

2206
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.090
<v Speaker 9>I think psychopaths are,</v>

2207
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.670
<v Speaker 9>are sort of anti social folks that hey people,</v>

2208
01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:22.860
<v Speaker 9>I tend to love people.</v>

2209
01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.700
<v Speaker 9>I tend to love people in spite of their faults,</v>

2210
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:30.450
<v Speaker 9>in spite of the things that they do or attempt to do.</v>

2211
01:01:30.451 --> 01:01:31.284
<v Speaker 9>To me.</v>

2212
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:33.150
<v Speaker 9>You're well aware of,</v>

2213
01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:34.800
<v Speaker 9>of Marcy for example,</v>

2214
01:01:34.801 --> 01:01:35.460
<v Speaker 9>who,</v>

2215
01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:40.460
<v Speaker 9>who plotted for for three months they have me kidnapped for money and um,</v>

2216
01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:42.860
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

2217
01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:44.770
<v Speaker 9>whenever she,</v>

2218
01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:49.750
<v Speaker 9>she lived with me after that for two additional months before they finally got</v>

2219
01:01:49.751 --> 01:01:50.584
<v Speaker 9>too intense.</v>

2220
01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.030
<v Speaker 5>This is a good question.</v>

2221
01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:59.090
<v Speaker 5>Why do you surround yourself with people of questionable character?</v>

2222
01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:01.390
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

2223
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:05.170
<v Speaker 9>I surround myself with people of club on questionable character to Eddie and</v>

2224
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:05.681
<v Speaker 9>Kona is,</v>

2225
01:02:05.681 --> 01:02:06.281
<v Speaker 9>I don't know,</v>

2226
01:02:06.281 --> 01:02:07.180
<v Speaker 9>a more honest,</v>

2227
01:02:07.181 --> 01:02:10.460
<v Speaker 9>a god fearing person yourself.</v>

2228
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.370
<v Speaker 9>So I think I'd be friended to and,</v>

2229
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.940
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>

2230
01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:15.590
<v Speaker 9>and embraced you as I embraced anyone else.</v>

2231
01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:17.440
<v Speaker 9>Not even the audio that I was looking for,</v>

2232
01:02:17.441 --> 01:02:18.270
<v Speaker 9>unfortunately.</v>

2233
01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:19.103
<v Speaker 9>Pretty good.</v>

2234
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:20.030
<v Speaker 9>But the</v>

2235
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:22.550
<v Speaker 1>other one was better because it was really nuts</v>

2236
01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:22.780
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

2237
01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.230
<v Speaker 2>when I worked at the comedy store,</v>

2238
01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:25.640
<v Speaker 2>there was this lady who would call,</v>

2239
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember her name,</v>

2240
01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.480
<v Speaker 2>but she would call and like I,</v>

2241
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2242
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:33.890
<v Speaker 2>she is interesting her the way that her insanity function,</v>

2243
01:02:33.891 --> 01:02:35.060
<v Speaker 2>cause she'd call and be like,</v>

2244
01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:37.530
<v Speaker 2>she would always say she used to work out their camera name,</v>

2245
01:02:37.531 --> 01:02:39.260
<v Speaker 2>but then she'd like start being like,</v>

2246
01:02:39.261 --> 01:02:39.561
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2247
01:02:39.561 --> 01:02:40.394
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2248
01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:40.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2249
01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Last Wednesday,</v>

2250
01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:46.670
<v Speaker 2>three men came into my house and they raped me and laughed and you know,</v>

2251
01:02:46.671 --> 01:02:50.000
<v Speaker 2>like we'd slip in these really weird hardcore story.</v>

2252
01:02:50.001 --> 01:02:53.300
<v Speaker 2>She called a few times and it was always like these plots against her,</v>

2253
01:02:53.301 --> 01:02:53.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2254
01:02:53.541 --> 01:02:53.721
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2255
01:02:53.721 --> 01:02:54.680
<v Speaker 2>they did like,</v>

2256
01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:55.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2257
01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:56.570
<v Speaker 2>I was kidnapped.</v>

2258
01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2259
01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:58.280
<v Speaker 2>she was just making things up.</v>

2260
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.760
<v Speaker 2>She had,</v>

2261
01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:59.990
<v Speaker 2>but she believed it.</v>

2262
01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.250
<v Speaker 2>And you know what I mean?</v>

2263
01:03:01.251 --> 01:03:02.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like when your mind,</v>

2264
01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I don't know about Maca.</v>

2265
01:03:03.951 --> 01:03:04.431
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2266
01:03:04.431 --> 01:03:04.881
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

2267
01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's all together and he's totally there.</v>

2268
01:03:06.711 --> 01:03:08.030
<v Speaker 2>People were really plotting against him.</v>

2269
01:03:08.031 --> 01:03:08.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2270
01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.490
<v Speaker 2>rich people live in a different land.</v>

2271
01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.020
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting how like people who are paranoid,</v>

2272
01:03:15.021 --> 01:03:15.890
<v Speaker 2>the way it comes out,</v>

2273
01:03:15.891 --> 01:03:17.510
<v Speaker 2>it's not like they're gonna be like everybody's</v>

2274
01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:20.760
<v Speaker 1>see that people are looking to kidnap him.</v>

2275
01:03:20.761 --> 01:03:22.470
<v Speaker 1>She has been plotting to kidnap me and for,</v>

2276
01:03:22.471 --> 01:03:23.080
<v Speaker 1>so when I'm,</v>

2277
01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.980
<v Speaker 1>when someone starts talking and that sort of matter of factly,</v>

2278
01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:26.591
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2279
01:03:26.591 --> 01:03:29.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a disconnect there from reality as well.</v>

2280
01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:29.401
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2281
01:03:29.401 --> 01:03:30.234

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:30.600

2285
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.240
<v Speaker 1>but we'll do it again quite soon.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

2287
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:35.450

01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:35.910

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:39.980
