<v Speaker 1>is this young man called Fabian who's </v>

17
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:49.191
<v Speaker 1>like a tech nerd in Brussels and he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea to get rich from giving the </v>

18
00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>world free porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So free streaming porn.</v>

19
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>So the series is about the kind of tech </v>
<v Speaker 1>takeover of porn in the valley.</v>

20
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>I know that that's the real.</v>

21
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one's everywhere.</v>

22
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

23
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>that was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was back in the day that I was like</v>

24
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:08.481
<v Speaker 1>in the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Fabian Fabian gave the world pornhub </v>

25
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>and fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

26
00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:11.160
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

27
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 1>this is so true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

28
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let me go back.</v>

29
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>So in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid called Fabian Fabian Tillman as</v>

30
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>a young boy in Brussels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tech nerd,</v>

31
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would let go and compuserve and swap </v>

32
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.951
<v Speaker 1>porn and so get porn for free like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how people got for back in the </v>

33
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:32.810
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>and then he had like a sort of Eureka </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

35
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>which is I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give the world youtube for porn.</v>

36
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he brought up this fledgling company </v>

37
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.580
<v Speaker 1>in Montreal called uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>it was called Mansef at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was run by these two brothers up in </v>

39
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Montreal and they had just invented </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pornhub,</v>

40
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fabian bought a porn hub and then kind </v>

41
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>of overnight singlehandedly took over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the valley.</v>

42
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an extraordinary story.</v>

43
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>This massive flow of money went from </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are now in the valley,</v>

44
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>a community of people who were making </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good money from porn.</v>

45
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>The money just load into Fabian's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket,</v>

46
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what Fabian did was,</v>

47
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

48
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:27.501
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a porn star and you go to a </v>

49
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>bank and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I have a checking account?</v>

50
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>You see a porn star or porn stir upon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>I said a porn star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually there aren't really many </v>

52
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.541
<v Speaker 1>porn stars anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a poor person and you go to a </v>

53
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>bank and he say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I have a checking account?</v>

54
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>The bank manager will usually say no </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're in porn,</v>

55
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>which means your disreputable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

56
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

57
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>people like story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written about this a lot about how </v>

58
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>they found it really hard to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortgages.</v>

59
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.031
<v Speaker 1>How did they find it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hard to get checking accounts with </v>

60
00:02:59.031 --> 00:02:59.031
<v Speaker 1>checking accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems unlikely.</v>

61
00:02:59.031 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may be mortgages.</v>

62
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 2>They would think that your business is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly unstable.</v>

63
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 2>That kind of makes sense as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>investments are concerned</v>

64
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>and also the idea that other people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the customers might not like the idea </v>

65
00:03:10.701 --> 00:03:14.940
<v Speaker 1>that are high street bank is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>shared with somebody who's in bone.</v>

66
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

67
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Go reputational risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

68
00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:21.920
<v Speaker 1>That seems really dumb to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't make any sense at all.</v>

69
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.330
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>but Fabian was making money from running</v>
<v Speaker 1>a site that doubt in the,</v>

72
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.920
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in piracy.</v>

73
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>So the funds would upload pole and </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegally onto pornhub.</v>

74
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.540
<v Speaker 1>So Fabian was running this site that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>failed with pirated content.</v>

75
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fabian went to a bank to say I want to </v>

76
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.510
<v Speaker 1>expand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because he wasn't extensively a poor</v>

77
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a tech person who was deemed to </v>

78
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.970
<v Speaker 1>be respectable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bank gave him a $362,000,000</v>

79
00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:01.320
<v Speaker 1>loan to expand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.110
<v Speaker 1>to build an empire based in part on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>handling of stolen porn.</v>

81
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>So we went to the valley who will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who already kind of paranoid that all </v>

82
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>poor and was being stolen and put up </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto pornhub and he bought up all the </v>

83
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>loads of companies that cut price </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the companies were like </v>

84
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to sell.</v>

85
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm certainly fabian just single </v>
<v Speaker 1>handedly,</v>

86
00:04:22.371 --> 00:04:24.770
<v Speaker 1>like took her for porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

87
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.610
<v Speaker 1>so I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody cares about that.</v>

88
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that because Fabian was </v>

89
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.810
<v Speaker 1>given the world what they wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's risk free porn.</v>

90
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was really curious to know level,</v>

91
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.250
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to let me know.</v>

92
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Pause there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said no one cares about it.</v>

93
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people did.</v>

94
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:46.381
<v Speaker 2>It was a huge issue and there was a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like moral debate around weapons </v>

95
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.560
<v Speaker 2>stopping poem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of the girls that were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>porn that were really pissed off because</v>

97
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 2>they weren't making any money anymore </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were,</v>

98
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:58.741
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of social media posts </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it imploring people to stop using </v>

99
00:04:58.741 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 2>these sites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which no one listened to.</v>

100
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People cat pulled and consumers didn't.</v>

101
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Well it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an interesting tech,</v>

102
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.340
<v Speaker 2>like a moral tech debate that was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on for awhile.</v>

103
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 2>But the debate is lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

104
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:13.550
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

105
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting because there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a guy who lived down the street from</v>

106
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:21.061
<v Speaker 2>me and he was a big time porn producer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I actually knew him from my Jujitsu </v>

107
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 2>class and he was a real high role in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of character.</v>

108
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:30.421
<v Speaker 2>Like he always had this beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mercedes Benz and he wore these really </v>

109
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:33.961
<v Speaker 2>big watches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of fancy clothes and he was just </v>

110
00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:38.070
<v Speaker 2>making just tons of money and he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>this beautiful house and he was just </v>

111
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.680
<v Speaker 2>this baller character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it all dried up,</v>

112
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 2>dried up quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

113
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.300
<v Speaker 2>It went well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went into lost his house.</v>

114
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 2>His house got repossessed.</v>

115
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Fabian got so rich because of this,</v>

116
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.770
<v Speaker 1>because the money went from the orphans </v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket into Fabian's pocket.</v>

117
00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Fabian got so rich that how's he rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>off of free streaming.</v>

118
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 1>So the ads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was partly because of ads,</v>

119
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>but partly because he brought up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid sites as well.</v>

120
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.430
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the paid sites were like </v>

121
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.430
<v Speaker 1>panicking because they were losing all </v>
<v Speaker 1>their money to piracy.</v>

122
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Bought up everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we brought up the competition.</v>

123
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:16.301
<v Speaker 1>He bought it redtube youporn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he bought up all the competition to </v>

124
00:06:16.301 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Pornhub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also bought loads of paid sites.</v>

125
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Be like playboy TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your friend got so poor that his </v>

126
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.331
<v Speaker 1>house got repossessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fabian got so rich that he installed in </v>

127
00:06:28.331 --> 00:06:31.601
<v Speaker 1>his house and aquarium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was so big that it diver had to </v>

128
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:36.190
<v Speaker 1>come every week and dive in and clean </v>
<v Speaker 1>the coral reef.</v>

129
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing well when you get your </v>

130
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.920
<v Speaker 1>diver.</v>

131
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.920
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

133
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:49.031
<v Speaker 1>Porn people cared a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the outside world didn't care </v>

134
00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:52.751
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outside world doesn't care where </v>

135
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:52.751
<v Speaker 1>music's getting pirated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they show this powder.</v>

136
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Carolyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's porn.</v>

137
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they care a little bit about the music </v>

138
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.041
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the porn thing got almost no </v>

139
00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:02.261
<v Speaker 1>traction in when the porn industry is </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially for the most part collapsed </v>

140
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:05.450
<v Speaker 1>or at least there was a massive amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of loss.</v>

141
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.780
<v Speaker 1>There was no talk about like some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a bail out or anything silly like </v>

142
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.780
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

143
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is gone.</v>

144
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like many other industries were bailed </v>

145
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.050
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at that are smaller,</v>

146
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at their headquarters up </v>

147
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.460
<v Speaker 1>in Montreal or the company that owned </v>
<v Speaker 1>pole,</v>

148
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 1>now it's not poorly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's techie.</v>

149
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 1>So your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Fabian actually said to me,</v>

150
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:25.810
<v Speaker 1>quite tellingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said yes.</v>

151
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.430
<v Speaker 1>He said it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't even know that we will have</v>

152
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 1>input unless you went to the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>floor.</v>

153
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Now he seems like a guy who's well aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his crime.</v>

154
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Fabian say if it wasn't me,</v>

155
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be somebody else.</v>

156
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.790
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

157
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.410
<v Speaker 1>and it sounds like a good thing to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>after you kill somebody.</v>

158
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 1>I did say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

159
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>it's progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd call it progress,</v>

160
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a criminal.</v>

161
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's essentially he's lucky that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's dealing in pirated stuff,</v>

162
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one time Fabian got annoyed with me.</v>

163
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.280
<v Speaker 1>He was quite game like I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to interview him and then I </v>

164
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.791
<v Speaker 1>wanted to travel to the valley to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the consequences and untraced </v>

165
00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:13.331
<v Speaker 1>consequence through to consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where would I end up if I just </v>

166
00:08:13.331 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>because I think people don't think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences on the Internet that much.</v>

167
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>They want to just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.870
<v Speaker 1>destroy somebody and then carry on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their day.</v>

169
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:23.350
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to tell a story about </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences that the only time Fabian </v>

170
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.070
<v Speaker 1>got annoyed with me was when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

171
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.020
<v Speaker 1>either me or Mike Quasar director said </v>
<v Speaker 1>to him,</v>

172
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you uploaded pirated porn.</v>

173
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.370
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

174
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never uploaded pirated porn.</v>

175
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:39.430
<v Speaker 1>I offer a surface in which of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can upload pirated poured.</v>

176
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.650
<v Speaker 1>And if they tell us to take it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll take it down.</v>

177
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Which is they have to find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to find it,</v>

178
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:50.810
<v Speaker 1>and also there's so much fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>freeport and I'm pulling that.</v>

179
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like cutting down the forest with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>butter knife.</v>

180
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:55.670
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

181
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 1>you can say take down my partner Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll say okay.</v>

182
00:08:57.931 --> 00:09:02.931
<v Speaker 1>So he found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's like a million other </v>

183
00:09:02.931 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 1>people's report up there anyway yet.</v>

184
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.740
<v Speaker 1>So actually it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

185
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.820
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm about to say shouldn't be </v>

186
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 1>construed as me saying that I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fabian is a psychopath because I don't.</v>

187
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 1>But that thing about not taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for your own actions.</v>

188
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:19.401
<v Speaker 1>I just remembered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a book a few years ago about </v>

189
00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:21.111
<v Speaker 1>psychopaths called the psychopath test </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a psychopathic trait is that like if</v>

190
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:24.750
<v Speaker 1>somebody killed somebody in a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would say,</v>

191
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.450
<v Speaker 1>well it's his fault for looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny.</v>

192
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.600
<v Speaker 1>So failure to accept responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 1>our own actions is one of the 20 items </v>

193
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 1>on the psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>

194
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:36.740
<v Speaker 1>do you think it is a psychopath or do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it's some sort of a con?</v>

195
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Convenient neglecting have certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for what happened?</v>

196
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.160
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Fabian,</v>

197
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:49.161
<v Speaker 1>that was very much a tangential thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't think Fabian is a </v>

198
00:09:49.161 --> 00:09:49.161
<v Speaker 1>psychopath at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

199
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.350
<v Speaker 1>I think that tech people have created a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a moral bubble around </v>

200
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:55.410
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

201
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.330
<v Speaker 1>I talked to the head of a porn hub's Mo </v>
<v Speaker 1>bow division.</v>

202
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.560
<v Speaker 1>So if you've ever watched his called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brandon,</v>

203
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever watched a porn hub on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mobile,</v>

204
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:09.430
<v Speaker 1>you have brandon to thank and I said to </v>
<v Speaker 1>brandon,</v>

205
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Brandon said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never like 99 percent of pornhub </v>

206
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 1>employees never set foot on a porn set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

207
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:19.380
<v Speaker 1>that's good because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're designing,</v>

208
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with search engine people were,</v>

209
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to say it would be a,</v>

210
00:10:23.441 --> 00:10:27.000
<v Speaker 1>it would be sort of unpleasant to set </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot there would be sort of intimidating</v>

211
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:29.520
<v Speaker 1>and unpleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

212
00:10:29.521 --> 00:10:31.610
<v Speaker 1>well maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would've been good if more porn</v>

213
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.620
<v Speaker 1>hub people did set foot on porn sets </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you would be able to see the </v>

214
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:36.840
<v Speaker 1>negative consequences of your business </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>

215
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:42.260
<v Speaker 1>And Brendan went their livelihood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which again is a very tacky thing to </v>

216
00:10:43.231 --> 00:10:43.800
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

217
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Because it's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about progress,</v>

218
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.080
<v Speaker 1>their livelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

219
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.320
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

220
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:54.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you want to talk about their </v>

221
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:54.330
<v Speaker 1>livelihood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their livelihood people.</v>

222
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean they're essentially like a </v>

223
00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:57.700
<v Speaker 1>content provider that's not paying for </v>
<v Speaker 1>any content.</v>

224
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

225
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

226
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

227
00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I just remembered a guy called David </v>
<v Speaker 1>lowery who's a WHO's a,</v>

228
00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:09.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

229
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:15.170
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's interested in kind of piracy issue </v>

230
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.170
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in music.</v>

231
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.040
<v Speaker 1>And he said when we look back on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dystopian movies of the 19 thirties </v>

232
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:24.730
<v Speaker 1>where machines will take over like </v>
<v Speaker 1>metropolis or something like the moral </v>

233
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.600
<v Speaker 1>of the film that the climax of the film </v>
<v Speaker 1>is when the people,</v>

234
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 1>the humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a defeat say,</v>

235
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:30.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

236
00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:33.180
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to live in a world run </v>
<v Speaker 1>by machines.</v>

237
00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:36.240
<v Speaker 1>We're going to defeat the machines and </v>
<v Speaker 1>human morality or takeover.</v>

238
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.060
<v Speaker 1>But now that machines are ruling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

239
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:45.170
<v Speaker 1>instead of us defeating the machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are adapting our morality to fit in </v>

240
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:50.310
<v Speaker 1>with the machines capability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because it is easy to pirate,</v>

241
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:55.610
<v Speaker 1>instead of saying let's not pirate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just adapting a morality and </v>

242
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:55.610
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

243
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:55.610
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

244
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.120
<v Speaker 2>And we can watch pirated porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of,</v>

245
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as simple as pirating </v>

246
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.200
<v Speaker 2>because pirating is what everybody does </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

247
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

248
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 2>when they're sharing it through message </v>
<v Speaker 2>boards or what have you,</v>

249
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:11.040
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of pirating right when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're uploading it to these websites </v>

250
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.931
<v Speaker 2>and servers and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what he's doing is massively </v>

251
00:12:15.931 --> 00:12:19.621
<v Speaker 2>profiting off of other people's work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit of a more of a gray </v>

252
00:12:19.621 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

253
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.960
<v Speaker 2>I'd say so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not even gray,</v>

254
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Kinda dark when</v>

255
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.730
<v Speaker 1>he certainly profited hugely from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people pirating their favorite porn </v>

256
00:12:29.581 --> 00:12:31.560
<v Speaker 1>films onto his side because he had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>sued.</v>

257
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got into,</v>

258
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.930
<v Speaker 1>he got arrested for tax evasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

259
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.150
<v Speaker 1>and that's how we got out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>business eventually.</v>

260
00:12:39.151 --> 00:12:42.060
<v Speaker 1>But I think that woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that old got solved.</v>

261
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if he ever got sued because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody says to him,</v>

262
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 1>if somebody said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

263
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.490
<v Speaker 1>take down my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

264
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad babysitters.</v>

265
00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Volume two is mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that because I was actually on the</v>

266
00:12:52.681 --> 00:12:55.020
<v Speaker 1>set of bad babysitters volume two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

267
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.220
<v Speaker 1>he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

268
00:12:56.221 --> 00:12:56.670
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

269
00:12:56.671 --> 00:12:57.480
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

270
00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.730
<v Speaker 1>And it would go down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then maybe somebody else will put it</v>

271
00:12:59.731 --> 00:13:04.731
<v Speaker 1>up later that day or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't matter because everything </v>

272
00:13:04.731 --> 00:13:04.731
<v Speaker 1>else was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

273
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.950
<v Speaker 1>I tell you one amazing consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this though.</v>

274
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what I wanted to do in this order for</v>

275
00:13:10.521 --> 00:13:15.000
<v Speaker 1>series a butterfly effect was to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>trace the consequences of this,</v>

276
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:20.270
<v Speaker 1>know what was the tornadoes that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>being created on one amazing consequence</v>

277
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.930
<v Speaker 1>is like Fabian surrounded himself with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tech wizards.</v>

278
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Let people who knew how the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked,</v>

279
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.840
<v Speaker 1>including a lot of search engine people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of making porn films like </v>

280
00:13:35.401 --> 00:13:37.630
<v Speaker 1>they made in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

281
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.890
<v Speaker 1>this porn director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Quasar said to me that the first </v>

282
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.760
<v Speaker 1>film he ever made back in the nineties </v>
<v Speaker 1>was called women of influence.</v>

283
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Now all the poem films have to be easily</v>
<v Speaker 1>searchable.</v>

284
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:54.711
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a kind of arms race of search </v>

285
00:13:54.711 --> 00:13:56.781
<v Speaker 1>engine optimization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to get yourself up the google </v>

286
00:13:56.781 --> 00:13:56.781
<v Speaker 1>rankings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

287
00:13:56.781 --> 00:13:58.910
<v Speaker 1>so all the porn films in the valley </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't called women of influence because</v>

288
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.690
<v Speaker 1>how do you search for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

289
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:05.870
<v Speaker 1>They basically see what the most popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>search terms and then make films based </v>

290
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:10.851
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Mike Quasar was telling me this on </v>

291
00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:10.851
<v Speaker 1>the set of the film he was shooting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

292
00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:15.020
<v Speaker 1>which was stepdaughter cheerleader orgy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

293
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.550
<v Speaker 1>so I said to just is just around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>

294
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.950
<v Speaker 1>So I said to Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there,</v>

295
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:25.040
<v Speaker 1>because I thought about light women of </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence versus stepdaughter </v>

296
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.361
<v Speaker 1>cheerleader orgy a look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen women of influence.</v>

297
00:14:30.391 --> 00:14:35.391
<v Speaker 1>So for all I know the moral of women of </v>
<v Speaker 1>influences that women shouldn't have </v>

298
00:14:35.391 --> 00:14:39.141
<v Speaker 1>influenced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my guess is that women have </v>

299
00:14:39.141 --> 00:14:39.141
<v Speaker 1>influence is more kind of holistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>poured,</v>

300
00:14:39.141 --> 00:14:40.650
<v Speaker 1>filmed and stepdaughter cheerleader </v>
<v Speaker 1>orgy.</v>

301
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.980
<v Speaker 1>So I said to Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there any people in the valley who </v>

302
00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.631
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get work because they're just not </v>

303
00:14:50.631 --> 00:14:51.970
<v Speaker 1>a keyword?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my one,</v>

304
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like every asshole porn actress now </v>

305
00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:02.141
<v Speaker 1>between the ages of 23 and 29 can't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>work because they're not a teen and </v>

306
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:08.861
<v Speaker 1>they're not a MILF.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like in this sort of fallow </v>

307
00:15:08.861 --> 00:15:12.611
<v Speaker 1>periods between teen and MILF when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just attractive and just </v>

308
00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Speaker 1>attractive isn't a searchable term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're not a teen and you're not a</v>

309
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:20.981
<v Speaker 1>MILF,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're like a 26 year old adult film </v>

310
00:15:20.981 --> 00:15:20.981
<v Speaker 1>actress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get work.</v>

311
00:15:20.981 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 1>You just have to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

312
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I said to Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

313
00:15:24.161 --> 00:15:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you just like sit there until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a MILF?</v>

314
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Become employable again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answers they have to find other ways</v>

315
00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:36.461
<v Speaker 1>to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So escorting is going through the roof </v>

316
00:15:36.461 --> 00:15:36.461
<v Speaker 1>and in the Valley A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

317
00:15:36.461 --> 00:15:40.771
<v Speaker 1>because of the tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people like Fabian because of </v>

318
00:15:40.771 --> 00:15:40.771
<v Speaker 1>the tech takeover of porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Escorting is going through the roof.</v>

319
00:15:40.771 --> 00:15:45.020
<v Speaker 1>But also another thing that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the roof is this kind of weirdly</v>

320
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.230
<v Speaker 1>adorable world of bespoke porn.</v>

321
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the article will.</v>

322
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.210
<v Speaker 2>What was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

323
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.900
<v Speaker 2>publication who published that article </v>
<v Speaker 2>with The Guardian?</v>

324
00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I did like a written version of one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the episodes of the show.</v>

325
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.270
<v Speaker 2>I just stumbled upon it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

326
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.730
<v Speaker 2>knowing that you going to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know you wrote it.</v>

327
00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:03.830
<v Speaker 2>I was reading it and as I was reading I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

328
00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:04.460
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John wrote,</v>

329
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:08.180
<v Speaker 2>this is what an amazing did you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this world?</v>

330
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Know on your ride in Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in the valley.</v>

331
00:16:12.611 --> 00:16:17.611
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty fascinating and explain </v>

332
00:16:17.611 --> 00:16:20.921
<v Speaker 2>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people literally will request some </v>

333
00:16:20.921 --> 00:16:24.551
<v Speaker 2>of the most bizarre things and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people will make custom films based on </v>

334
00:16:25.311 --> 00:16:26.240
<v Speaker 2>their weird kinks</v>

335
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:31.350
<v Speaker 1>just for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a team of professional porn people </v>

336
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.340
<v Speaker 1>because the valley suffering so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of pornhub and so on.</v>

337
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.610
<v Speaker 1>We'll make an entire porn film just for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

338
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.260
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much does something like this cost?</v>

339
00:16:38.261 --> 00:16:43.261
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you want to make a film </v>
<v Speaker 2>about girls when mutant Ninja turtle </v>

340
00:16:43.261 --> 00:16:46.760
<v Speaker 2>outfits who kit guys in the balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's entirely possible,</v>

341
00:16:46.761 --> 00:16:47.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

342
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything's possible.</v>

343
00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:52.430
<v Speaker 2>But that sounds like something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>might actually sell at the yet.</v>

344
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got like a couple of thousand </v>

345
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.550
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

346
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple grand.</v>

347
00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

348
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got so obsessed with the world of </v>

349
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.941
<v Speaker 1>bespoke porn because it was such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating window into people's inner </v>

350
00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:11.820
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the first ones I saw was,</v>

351
00:17:11.821 --> 00:17:14.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a condiments video,</v>

352
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.950
<v Speaker 1>ketchup and relish and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

353
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a woman sitting in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

354
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a child's paddling pool and out of </v>

355
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.880
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the bespoke porn producers is </v>

356
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.090
<v Speaker 1>pouring industrial sized tubs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>condiments on her head,</v>

357
00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:34.860
<v Speaker 1>like ketchup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mustard and what's.</v>

358
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.130
<v Speaker 1>And the woman's like tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

359
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.390
<v Speaker 1>she's being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's engaged.</v>

360
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:39.060
<v Speaker 1>So she's going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

361
00:17:39.061 --> 00:17:41.910
<v Speaker 1>it's so cold and slimy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

362
00:17:41.911 --> 00:17:46.110
<v Speaker 1>the guy who commissioned this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the producers knew one thing about him.</v>

363
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.590
<v Speaker 1>He's a restauranteur who with continents</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

364
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.150
<v Speaker 1>How weird and has to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

365
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 1>presumably for situations like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in this restaurant.</v>

366
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.350
<v Speaker 1>So he just sits around thinking like as </v>
<v Speaker 1>customers sitting down a lot,</v>

367
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:03.670
<v Speaker 1>I like the score to her with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayonnaise.</v>

368
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Just lather up with cash or maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress,</v>

369
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

370
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.800
<v Speaker 1>if this type of mayonnaise for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

371
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.610
<v Speaker 1>we'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

372
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.840
<v Speaker 1>We get sued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

373
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.860
<v Speaker 1>With doom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't like that'd be like cleaning </v>

374
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:21.860
<v Speaker 1>pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

375
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's like maybe his release says </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do this.</v>

376
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

377
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Another one was a Norwegian man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

378
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:35.540
<v Speaker 1>has spent 40 years amassing of valuable </v>
<v Speaker 1>stamp collection on his bespoke porn </v>

379
00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:43.461
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was descent his stamp collection to the </v>

380
00:18:43.461 --> 00:18:46.641
<v Speaker 1>valley with three naked porn women would</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy his stamp collection.</v>

381
00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

382
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Baker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a steal from it.</v>

383
00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

384
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.190
<v Speaker 1>How much does the stamp collection </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth?</v>

385
00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

386
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Well it turns out because we managed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>track down stamps,</v>

387
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:05.901
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he talked to us off to a lot of </v>

388
00:19:05.901 --> 00:19:05.950
<v Speaker 1>persuasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

389
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.000
<v Speaker 1>and he's got 10 books of stamps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

390
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:14.001
<v Speaker 1>once a year he sends one to accustom </v>
<v Speaker 1>woodsy.</v>

391
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

392
00:19:16.201 --> 00:19:21.201
<v Speaker 1>it turns out it's because he grew up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iceland where stamp collecting was a </v>

393
00:19:21.201 --> 00:19:24.480
<v Speaker 1>popular hobby at the time in like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies and the eighties.</v>

394
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.780
<v Speaker 1>A stamp collecting was big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

395
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:32.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he became like an obsessive stamp </v>

396
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:32.900
<v Speaker 1>collector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stamp shop owners would say,</v>

397
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.861
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you buy this standards can be very </v>

398
00:19:36.861 --> 00:19:37.830
<v Speaker 1>valuable in 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then came the internet and it killed</v>

399
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:42.831
<v Speaker 1>off the stump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it killed off stamp collecting as a </v>

400
00:19:42.831 --> 00:19:42.831
<v Speaker 1>hoppy light?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

401
00:19:42.831 --> 00:19:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Nerds apparently felt like other other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to be interested in.</v>

402
00:19:46.221 --> 00:19:51.221
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thrill of the chase just wasn't </v>

403
00:19:51.221 --> 00:19:51.221
<v Speaker 1>there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can easily pack.</v>

404
00:19:51.221 --> 00:19:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

405
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:55.710
<v Speaker 1>so his stamps lost all of their value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stamp stores closed down,</v>

406
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.820
<v Speaker 1>that kind of collegial atmosphere of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fellow stamp collectors just vanished.</v>

407
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he began to like,</v>

408
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regret his life choices of like spending</v>

409
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.930
<v Speaker 1>all that time and money collecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>stamps.</v>

410
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.200
<v Speaker 1>He began to feel depressed and isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he went to a CSI Chi atrust who told </v>

411
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.090
<v Speaker 1>them that stamp collecting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>

412
00:20:15.091 --> 00:20:20.091
<v Speaker 1>hoppy because it isolates him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now he pays porn people to destroy </v>

413
00:20:22.231 --> 00:20:27.231
<v Speaker 1>his stamps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The psychiatrist told them that a hobby </v>

414
00:20:27.231 --> 00:20:27.231
<v Speaker 1>is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

415
00:20:27.231 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 1>According to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not ever talked to the psychiatrist,</v>

416
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.170
<v Speaker 1>but according to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

417
00:20:31.171 --> 00:20:33.450
<v Speaker 1>he said that stamp collecting is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous hobby.</v>

418
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.300
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a ridiculous thing for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist to say.</v>

419
00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

420
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Bad Psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoys it.</v>

421
00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

422
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:45.360
<v Speaker 1>if you have all your ducks in a row and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is firing on all cylinders,</v>

423
00:20:45.361 --> 00:20:50.361
<v Speaker 1>but you really truly enjoy stamps poos </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's to tell you there's something </v>

424
00:20:50.361 --> 00:20:51.160
<v Speaker 1>wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

425
00:20:51.161 --> 00:20:51.730
<v Speaker 1>the only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

426
00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.110
<v Speaker 1>one good thing that came out of it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

427
00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 1>he really enriched the imaginations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people in the valley.</v>

428
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.590
<v Speaker 1>And also my imagination too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean stamps man,</v>

429
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.260
<v Speaker 1>because all the custom producers talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

430
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.580
<v Speaker 1>and stamps man with such a mystery to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them all.</v>

431
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.880
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at least he destroys the stamps now </v>

432
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.970
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's beneficial to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was so intriguing.</v>

433
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it amazing?</v>

434
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.360
<v Speaker 1>But it's all weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

435
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also quite sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

436
00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:26.671
<v Speaker 1>I'm Dan and Rhiana and who made one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stamps videos called us just as we </v>

437
00:21:26.671 --> 00:21:31.501
<v Speaker 1>were finishing our series and rhiannon </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in tears and they just had a request</v>

438
00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:37.740
<v Speaker 1>and the request was for a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy wanted a porn woman to sit cross </v>

439
00:21:38.471 --> 00:21:42.430
<v Speaker 1>legged on the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully clothed and say into the camera,</v>

440
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.600
<v Speaker 1>you are loved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things may be bad now,</v>

441
00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 1>but they won't always be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And suicide is not the answer.</v>

442
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they,</v>

443
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.160
<v Speaker 1>they felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

444
00:21:54.161 --> 00:21:59.161
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they told him they'd make the video </v>

445
00:21:59.161 --> 00:22:00.040
<v Speaker 1>for him and they could shoot it really </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>

446
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:02.590
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't respond.</v>

447
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.780
<v Speaker 1>So they made it anyway.</v>

448
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.530
<v Speaker 1>And we were there to record it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

449
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.440
<v Speaker 1>and it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it made me realize just how kind of </v>

450
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.190
<v Speaker 1>delightful the bespoke porn world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were so eager to,</v>

451
00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.490
<v Speaker 1>to help this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he jumps off?</v>

452
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.830
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made the video for him.</v>

453
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman,</v>

454
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:29.020
<v Speaker 1>the porn star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Riley was saying into the camera,</v>

455
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:31.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have thought about dying too,</v>

456
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.480
<v Speaker 1>but I came out of that hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

457
00:22:34.481 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 1>and I came back stronger and now I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see all the good in the world.</v>

458
00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:42.241
<v Speaker 1>And Riley was crying and Rihanna and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>producer was crying and they sent the </v>

459
00:22:42.241 --> 00:22:45.700
<v Speaker 1>video to the guy and we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

460
00:22:45.701 --> 00:22:50.701
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a few porn stars on </v>

461
00:22:50.701 --> 00:22:50.950
<v Speaker 1>twitter that have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

462
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.400
<v Speaker 1>are really like kind of motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter feeds.</v>

463
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Like they say nice things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say positive things.</v>

464
00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.000
<v Speaker 1>So those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem like healthy people and if you</v>

465
00:23:01.001 --> 00:23:05.680
<v Speaker 1>separate the fact that they have sex on </v>
<v Speaker 1>film for a living,</v>

466
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.980
<v Speaker 1>take that out of the mix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you have is like,</v>

467
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:13.720
<v Speaker 1>looks like your average person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do better in this world and is</v>

468
00:23:13.721 --> 00:23:18.190
<v Speaker 1>sharing positive things that they find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives them inspiration and moves them</v>

469
00:23:18.191 --> 00:23:20.050
<v Speaker 1>along in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

470
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:25.590
<v Speaker 1>but then you add the sex thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for whatever reason we have this </v>

471
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.510
<v Speaker 1>weird hangup about sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because we're all fucked up.</v>

472
00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:30.790
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to this girl called Dakota,</v>

473
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:34.720
<v Speaker 1>who was part of a radical honesty group </v>
<v Speaker 1>and radical honesty.</v>

474
00:23:34.721 --> 00:23:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Have you come across rabbit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

475
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would love it.</v>

476
00:23:39.311 --> 00:23:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I might be in one own and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can I take a radical honest.</v>

477
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were the first time I ever heard about </v>

478
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:47.460
<v Speaker 1>radical honesty.</v>

479
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend's Starlee kine at the </v>

480
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.050
<v Speaker 1>podcaster who went on a radical honesty </v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

481
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:53.360
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you have to do run</v>
<v Speaker 1>a podcast.</v>

482
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She does a podcast called mystery show.</v>

483
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.860
<v Speaker 1>She used to be on this American life </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

484
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.460
<v Speaker 1>So she went to a radical honesty group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

485
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.320
<v Speaker 1>we have to be radically honest to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

486
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:07.160
<v Speaker 1>So at how it starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been touring as well.</v>

487
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:12.340
<v Speaker 1>It starts with everybody's sitting in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>circle and they have to confess to the </v>

488
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:17.180
<v Speaker 1>room a secret about themselves that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've never told anyone.</v>

489
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 1>So the one that started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to the first guy said,</v>

490
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my secret is that I haven't paid taxes </v>

491
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.710
<v Speaker 1>in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so everyone went,</v>

492
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.270
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the next guy said,</v>

493
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:37.210
<v Speaker 1>my secret is that I killed a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet he said I was in a truck.</v>

494
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I was driving a truck and I kicked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>passenger out of the truck and he fell </v>

495
00:24:43.941 --> 00:24:48.941
<v Speaker 1>onto the road and he got run over and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got away with it and nobody,</v>

496
00:24:49.851 --> 00:24:51.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows that it was murder.</v>

497
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:57.290
<v Speaker 1>So then the next person in the circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when will my,</v>

498
00:24:57.291 --> 00:25:02.291
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my secrets so disappointing compared to </v>

499
00:25:02.291 --> 00:25:02.291
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

500
00:25:02.291 --> 00:25:04.610
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose I can tell you that I have sex</v>

501
00:25:04.611 --> 00:25:07.490
<v Speaker 1>with my cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the,</v>

502
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:12.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderer kind of put his hand up and </v>

503
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.690
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting.</v>

504
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so can I add somebody decent?</v>

505
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Could I add to my who should be sharing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>

506
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.190
<v Speaker 1>saw the officer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

507
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.220
<v Speaker 1>could I add something to my secret?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

508
00:25:21.221 --> 00:25:24.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also have sex with my cat.</v>

509
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:27.420
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

510
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:28.490
<v Speaker 1>one upper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

511
00:25:28.491 --> 00:25:29.190
<v Speaker 1>He had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

512
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.070
<v Speaker 1>he had to be the best secret in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

513
00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Here might be a bullshit artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

514
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.300
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem with those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

515
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.460
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

516
00:25:37.461 --> 00:25:42.461
<v Speaker 1>I met Brad Blanton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who runs these radical honesty </v>

517
00:25:42.461 --> 00:25:45.581
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I asked him whether Starley story </v>

518
00:25:45.581 --> 00:25:45.581
<v Speaker 1>was true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

519
00:25:45.581 --> 00:25:45.890
<v Speaker 1>and he said yes.</v>

520
00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the way she described that </v>
<v Speaker 1>circle.</v>

521
00:25:47.451 --> 00:25:49.110
<v Speaker 1>This is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

522
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.180
<v Speaker 1>so I was at this radical honesty group </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this church school in New Orleans,</v>

523
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:58.810
<v Speaker 1>and this girl called Dakota said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>her secret was that she was,</v>

524
00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.930
<v Speaker 1>she's this young church girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said her secret was actually watched</v>

525
00:26:02.931 --> 00:26:05.660
<v Speaker 1>porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

526
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.850
<v Speaker 1>what did you watch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Watch it on?</v>

527
00:26:07.851 --> 00:26:08.730
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hub,</v>

528
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.680
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how,</v>

529
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:12.380
<v Speaker 1>like every child in the world learns </v>
<v Speaker 1>about sex these days.</v>

530
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:17.950
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you ever get so into it that you </v>

531
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:17.950
<v Speaker 1>would like learn their names?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd say,</v>

532
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's James Dean.</v>

533
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.920
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

534
00:26:18.921 --> 00:26:19.220
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

535
00:26:19.221 --> 00:26:20.360
<v Speaker 1>She kind of laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

536
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:22.430
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never learned their names.</v>

537
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you kill a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't name it because then you can't</v>

538
00:26:25.941 --> 00:26:30.941
<v Speaker 1>eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is what the poor people are up </v>

539
00:26:30.941 --> 00:26:30.941
<v Speaker 1>against.</v>

540
00:26:30.941 --> 00:26:30.941
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this shame of,</v>

541
00:26:30.941 --> 00:26:33.410
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the viewer is like in,</v>

542
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.830
<v Speaker 1>in that hypocrisy lies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploitation,</v>

543
00:26:36.831 --> 00:26:41.150
<v Speaker 1>which is why somebody like Fabian can </v>
<v Speaker 1>come in and get a $300,000,000</v>

544
00:26:41.151 --> 00:26:46.151
<v Speaker 1>loan and take over porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because we don't want to think </v>

545
00:26:46.151 --> 00:26:46.440
<v Speaker 1>about it because it makes us feel bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>about ourselves.</v>

546
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.140
<v Speaker 1>But that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But her,</v>

547
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.160
<v Speaker 1>her issue is like church going plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>

548
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Whereas men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have very specific tastes and they </v>

549
00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.080
<v Speaker 1>tend to gravitate towards very specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn stars.</v>

550
00:27:01.081 --> 00:27:06.081
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things that I've noticed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really popular porn stars will have</v>

551
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.830
<v Speaker 1>like gigantic numbers on like social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

552
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:15.860
<v Speaker 1>twitter or instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like upwards of a million and maybe more</v>

553
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.380
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they obviously have a following,</v>

554
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:20.790
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

555
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:26.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said that a lot of poem women on </v>

556
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:26.270
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a positive.</v>

557
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.840
<v Speaker 1>And the interventional messages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why that is,</v>

558
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I met this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

559
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:32.520
<v Speaker 1>porn woman called macy may who was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>really depressed.</v>

560
00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Another Fabian's consequences is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kids grow up on,</v>

561
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:41.760
<v Speaker 1>on pornhub these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no longer that kind of outlaw</v>

562
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:46.761
<v Speaker 1>status about coming to the valley to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn that they used to be in like the </v>

563
00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:46.910
<v Speaker 1>eighties and nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

564
00:27:46.911 --> 00:27:50.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the valleys like flooded with women who,</v>

565
00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:50.760
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

566
00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:52.920
<v Speaker 1>they turn 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they watch porn out,</v>

567
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:55.180
<v Speaker 1>they think that looks cool and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to the valley and,</v>

568
00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:00.200
<v Speaker 1>and a negative consequence to that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they get work for like a couple of </v>

569
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:00.390
<v Speaker 1>weeks and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:28:00.391 --> 00:28:05.391
<v Speaker 1>there's loads more women off the bus and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the producers don't need to employ </v>

571
00:28:05.391 --> 00:28:09.051
<v Speaker 1>them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a massive turnaround to get </v>

572
00:28:09.051 --> 00:28:10.290
<v Speaker 1>work for a few weeks and then it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I met this woman called macy May,</v>

573
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:14.280
<v Speaker 1>who was in that funk lack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She came in May throughout May.</v>

574
00:28:14.281 --> 00:28:19.281
<v Speaker 1>She was working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met her in July and the worker just </v>

575
00:28:19.281 --> 00:28:19.281
<v Speaker 1>dried up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

576
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:23.490
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like venting on twitter and,</v>

577
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:27.120
<v Speaker 1>but then she stopped venting and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of her tweets were like,</v>

578
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy.</v>

579
00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.180
<v Speaker 1>It's such a beautiful day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

580
00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:32.040
<v Speaker 1>why did you stop venting on twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

581
00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:37.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of porn producers told me it </v>

582
00:28:37.041 --> 00:28:37.041
<v Speaker 1>looked bad for my brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

583
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.640
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

584
00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:43.641
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want us sort of miserable </v>

585
00:28:43.641 --> 00:28:44.730
<v Speaker 1>poor person saying I'm not getting work </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

586
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.340
<v Speaker 1>They want to pull person who says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a picture of my butt.</v>

587
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and isn't that unhealthy right there?</v>

588
00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:55.080
<v Speaker 1>This is what we've turn twitter into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've turned into this thing where we're</v>

589
00:28:55.081 --> 00:29:00.000
<v Speaker 1>not allowed to be ourselves or to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth about ourselves.</v>

590
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this particular example maybe,</v>

591
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.530
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an inherently,</v>

592
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.340
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

593
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.800
<v Speaker 1>in my estimation and many others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a depressing business.</v>

594
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know why.</v>

595
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of people,</v>

596
00:29:15.301 --> 00:29:18.270
<v Speaker 1>the idea of young girl going into porn </v>
<v Speaker 1>is depressing.</v>

597
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have daughters.</v>

598
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Your idea of my daughter's going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn is very depressing.</v>

599
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've met porn stars and seem nice.</v>

600
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.530
<v Speaker 1>They seem happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

601
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:31.860
<v Speaker 1>but why is it that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to have sex,</v>

602
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.790
<v Speaker 1>but if you have sex on film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

603
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.220
<v Speaker 1>And everybody gets to wash the shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

604
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

605
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:42.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird side effect of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations.</v>

606
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 1>The shame coming in from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the outside looking in.</v>

607
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:50.911
<v Speaker 1>There's no shame when I was on the set </v>
<v Speaker 1>of stepdaughter cheerleader orgy,</v>

608
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:55.660
<v Speaker 1>which was quite close to where we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

609
00:29:55.661 --> 00:30:00.580
<v Speaker 1>probably like a mile away from here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but up in the hills and um,</v>

610
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:05.230
<v Speaker 1>it was a kind of familial bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone must be nice to each other</v>

611
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:07.300
<v Speaker 1>and was happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Mike,</v>

612
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:12.330
<v Speaker 1>the director needed to get an </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing shots if the cheerleaders </v>

613
00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.230
<v Speaker 1>arriving home from cheerleader practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we went outside.</v>

614
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:19.530
<v Speaker 1>They were wearing their cheerleader </v>
<v Speaker 1>outfits and some teenagers had caught </v>

615
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:20.950
<v Speaker 1>onto what was happening at a porn film </v>
<v Speaker 1>was being shot,</v>

616
00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:25.970
<v Speaker 1>like up on a nearby hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were like cat calling and </v>

617
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:27.760
<v Speaker 1>hissing and sort of mocking these girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the first time,</v>

618
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.890
<v Speaker 1>not just the girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the camera man,</v>

619
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.920
<v Speaker 1>the director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody suddenly felt like self </v>

620
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:34.920
<v Speaker 1>conscious and the girls were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

621
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:40.260
<v Speaker 1>sort of try to put guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So until the mocking outside is came </v>

622
00:30:40.301 --> 00:30:43.150
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was healthy and shame free.</v>

623
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.640
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as an outsider started </v>
<v Speaker 1>hissing at them,</v>

624
00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:47.780
<v Speaker 1>it became shameful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>

625
00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.040
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's poor.</v>

626
00:30:49.041 --> 00:30:54.041
<v Speaker 1>And for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most of the problems that poor </v>

627
00:30:54.041 --> 00:30:56.590
<v Speaker 1>people face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stigma from the outside,</v>

628
00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.400
<v Speaker 1>not from the community itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which tends to be quite respectful.</v>

629
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.070
<v Speaker 3>And the people that were mocking them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

630
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:08.071
<v Speaker 3>they're young teenagers and second of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all they're probably thinking of it in </v>

631
00:31:08.071 --> 00:31:10.240
<v Speaker 3>terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like their online.</v>

632
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

633
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:16.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean like one of the things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>online is there's no consequences for </v>

634
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.740
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then people have no problem shitting</v>

635
00:31:17.741 --> 00:31:19.510
<v Speaker 3>on people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We couldn't see them.</v>

636
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.940
<v Speaker 3>We could only hear them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking,</v>

637
00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:27.050
<v Speaker 3>looking up and I couldn't say them </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were up on like a rich </v>

638
00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:27.790
<v Speaker 3>about the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

639
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.520
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just almost like being anonymous.</v>

640
00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

641
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anonymous people online,</v>

642
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:38.420
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the behavior is very bizarre because </v>

643
00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.660
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes I'll see people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>comments,</v>

644
00:31:40.661 --> 00:31:45.550
<v Speaker 3>whether it's to me or to somebody else </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're so fucking vicious and nasty</v>

645
00:31:45.551 --> 00:31:48.580
<v Speaker 3>over nothing over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing over nothing.</v>

646
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

647
00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:54.280
<v Speaker 3>someone's movie that they did or some </v>
<v Speaker 3>album that they did or whatever it was.</v>

648
00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:55.280
<v Speaker 3>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

649
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:59.590
<v Speaker 3>shitting all over every aspect of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>purse just almost,</v>

650
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:02.530
<v Speaker 3>just to try to get them to hurt the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're hurting,</v>

651
00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:04.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's almost what it seems like.</v>

652
00:32:04.451 --> 00:32:08.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're just like super angry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitter person.</v>

653
00:32:08.771 --> 00:32:13.330
<v Speaker 3>It's just life is just throwing rocks at</v>
<v Speaker 3>them everywhere they go and every chance</v>

654
00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:14.950
<v Speaker 3>they get throw rock back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

655
00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

656
00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:16.990
<v Speaker 1>that random even song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

657
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.330
<v Speaker 1>I just want you to hit like I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

658
00:32:20.331 --> 00:32:21.860
<v Speaker 1>I'd say there's certainly an element to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

659
00:32:21.861 --> 00:32:24.740
<v Speaker 1>There's also an element of what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right call.</v>

660
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.200
<v Speaker 1>What was that phrase that the use all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

661
00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:32.530
<v Speaker 1>a virtue signaling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't like using that phrase </v>

662
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.160
<v Speaker 1>because it's so been kind of adopted by </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of,</v>

663
00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white nationalists,</v>

664
00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.970
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it exists actually.</v>

665
00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Signaling is absolutely real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it all the time.</v>

666
00:32:42.051 --> 00:32:44.180
<v Speaker 1>I say it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually like really,</v>

667
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:49.181
<v Speaker 1>really weak men know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trying really hard to court the </v>

668
00:32:49.181 --> 00:32:52.550
<v Speaker 1>favor of women and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive and they're not desirable.</v>

669
00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.770
<v Speaker 1>And so they try really hard to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>allies.</v>

670
00:32:55.010 --> 00:33:00.010
<v Speaker 1>And the last time I was here I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't feel that as it was out of </v>

671
00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:02.360
<v Speaker 1>my public shaming book coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

672
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:07.370
<v Speaker 1>And like a sort of small group of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to sort of try this group.</v>

673
00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrong thing.</v>

674
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:12.750
<v Speaker 1>You were guilty of wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

675
00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I just read a story this morning in </v>
<v Speaker 1>voucher about the young adult world </v>

676
00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.210
<v Speaker 1>where this book came out called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

677
00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:23.610
<v Speaker 4>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the light.</v>

678
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.060
<v Speaker 4>Let me see if I can find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

679
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:32.530
<v Speaker 1>called the black witch and it said it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a liberal book as a young adult book </v>

680
00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:33.380
<v Speaker 1>that's a liberal book is a progressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

681
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:38.650
<v Speaker 1>but it contains a racist characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a blogger took some of the quotes </v>

682
00:33:40.141 --> 00:33:42.230
<v Speaker 1>that the racist characters set in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

683
00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.650
<v Speaker 1>This voucher article quote certainly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>took them out of context,</v>

684
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.800
<v Speaker 1>page one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six three.</v>

685
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:54.310
<v Speaker 1>The celts are not a pure race like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more accepting of into marriage </v>

686
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.540
<v Speaker 1>and because of this they're hopelessly </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed.</v>

687
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:59.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's a quote from the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the blog wrote underneath.</v>

688
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You read that with your own two eyes.</v>

689
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:07.930
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the times my jaw drops in</v>
<v Speaker 1>horror and I had to walk away from this </v>

690
00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:10.460
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then how noble.</v>

691
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:15.940
<v Speaker 1>So then like hundreds and hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like pounding on the book and </v>

692
00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:16.640
<v Speaker 1>then Kirk gave this book or a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>review.</v>

693
00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.730
<v Speaker 1>And then people pounding on circus </v>
<v Speaker 1>circus.</v>

694
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Circus is like this industry is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you write a book,</v>

695
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.190
<v Speaker 1>one of the first review to get us from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kirkus.</v>

696
00:34:25.191 --> 00:34:27.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's an industrial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that word K I r,</v>

697
00:34:27.741 --> 00:34:29.050
<v Speaker 1>K u s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

698
00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.630
<v Speaker 1>And if you get like a start because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>feels like a big deal.</v>

699
00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:38.810
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they piled in on curriculum for </v>

700
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.321
<v Speaker 1>giving it a good review.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I noticed two things happened as </v>

701
00:34:42.321 --> 00:34:43.100
<v Speaker 1>result of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was actually,</v>

702
00:34:43.101 --> 00:34:46.220
<v Speaker 1>it didn't seem to affect the book's </v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

703
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book is doing well,</v>

704
00:34:47.851 --> 00:34:49.730
<v Speaker 1>like on Amazon and people actually read </v>
<v Speaker 1>the book,</v>

705
00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm offended by it and the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened with my book.</v>

706
00:34:52.251 --> 00:34:57.251
<v Speaker 1>So you've been publicly shamed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the cat of people trying to turn </v>

707
00:34:57.251 --> 00:34:57.251
<v Speaker 1>against the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't.</v>

708
00:34:57.251 --> 00:35:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers are so small numbers of </v>

709
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:02.810
<v Speaker 1>twats that are actually out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating the bushes for this stuff.</v>

710
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:04.390
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

711
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:09.520
<v Speaker 1>2000 people or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 100 maybe even very vocal and if </v>

712
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.060
<v Speaker 1>there's anyone particularly upset at </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

713
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.210
<v Speaker 1>it might just be there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's many instances where people were</v>

714
00:35:14.211 --> 00:35:18.860
<v Speaker 1>attacked by one person and that person </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumes multiple identities online,</v>

715
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:24.190
<v Speaker 1>an out of body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mine was dealing with someone who was </v>

716
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.190
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

717
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real common.</v>

718
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

719
00:35:26.241 --> 00:35:31.241
<v Speaker 1>just single you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you wrote something that you </v>

720
00:35:31.241 --> 00:35:32.060
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found personally offensive or.</v>

721
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:35.390
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that drives me crazy about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

722
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.250
<v Speaker 1>about this taking out of context,</v>

723
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:43.250
<v Speaker 2>this character who's a racist character </v>
<v Speaker 2>is we were talking about fiction and </v>

724
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:48.891
<v Speaker 2>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't portray realistic humans </v>

725
00:35:48.891 --> 00:35:53.270
<v Speaker 2>mean there are racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how come you're allowed to make a </v>

726
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 2>fictional character about a murderer or </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

727
00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:01.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a Nazi type character or </v>

728
00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.000
<v Speaker 2>something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how come that's okay.</v>

729
00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

730
00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:08.220
<v Speaker 1>these are kind of young kids because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the why a world and I,</v>

731
00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:08.800
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

732
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:13.350
<v Speaker 2>why a young adult type of publishing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

733
00:36:13.351 --> 00:36:15.000
<v Speaker 2>they're not thinking it through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there,</v>

734
00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:17.550
<v Speaker 2>they're not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just seeing an opportunity to be</v>

735
00:36:17.551 --> 00:36:18.630
<v Speaker 2>outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

736
00:36:18.631 --> 00:36:23.631
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the expression recreational </v>

737
00:36:23.631 --> 00:36:23.631
<v Speaker 2>outrage.</v>

738
00:36:23.631 --> 00:36:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

739
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.480
<v Speaker 1>but the other thing that happened as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>result of their.</v>

740
00:36:26.481 --> 00:36:29.720
<v Speaker 1>So the book itself apparently isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>being particularly negatively affected,</v>

741
00:36:29.721 --> 00:36:32.030
<v Speaker 1>even though the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outrage was,</v>

742
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.670
<v Speaker 1>was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably helps it possibly.</v>

743
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:39.380
<v Speaker 1>But I'm the journalists from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulture article interview publishers who</v>

744
00:36:39.381 --> 00:36:44.381
<v Speaker 1>basically a stagnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're telling our authors to get as </v>

745
00:36:44.381 --> 00:36:45.350
<v Speaker 1>having a chilling effect on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on novels.</v>

746
00:36:45.351 --> 00:36:48.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't put in like if,</v>

747
00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.080
<v Speaker 1>if the authors white don't try and put </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a person of color as a cat and it's </v>

748
00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.080
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not worth it,</v>

749
00:36:54.081 --> 00:36:55.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't do it.</v>

750
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:59.120
<v Speaker 1>So actually these new roles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new roles a few years,</v>

751
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I just wrote this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

752
00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I've been writing movies lately and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

753
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:09.430
<v Speaker 1>and I always try and put in characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>of color and because I think,</v>

754
00:37:11.361 --> 00:37:11.900
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

755
00:37:11.901 --> 00:37:16.190
<v Speaker 1>maybe a director will kind of ignore it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I put that into a screenplay,</v>

756
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:20.540
<v Speaker 1>then there's a good chance that a person</v>
<v Speaker 1>of color is going to get offered,</v>

757
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a role,</v>

758
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.770
<v Speaker 1>but now suddenly I'm being told like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

759
00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:26.330
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't do that.</v>

760
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Will you be told you're being told you </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't do that because you need to </v>

761
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.510
<v Speaker 2>stay in your lane?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

762
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.880
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not been told it,</v>

763
00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:37.881
<v Speaker 2>but I'm reading these articles where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>read that novelists of being told this </v>

764
00:37:37.881 --> 00:37:41.430
<v Speaker 2>is a different situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not talking about an offensive </v>

765
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.430
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should probably clarify that.</v>

766
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

767
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.590
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

768
00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about is someone's </v>

769
00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.170
<v Speaker 2>telling you not to do or maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't do a person of color in your </v>

770
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:49.500
<v Speaker 2>screenplay because that's not your </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

771
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

772
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.810
<v Speaker 2>It's been told according to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>voucher,</v>

773
00:37:52.811 --> 00:37:57.811
<v Speaker 2>Roscoe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everyone today route isn't being </v>

774
00:37:57.811 --> 00:37:57.811
<v Speaker 2>told not to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

775
00:37:57.811 --> 00:37:57.811
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

776
00:37:57.811 --> 00:37:59.160
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a different thing.</v>

777
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:04.490
<v Speaker 2>It could easily be misconstrued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to let anybody take you </v>

778
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:04.490
<v Speaker 2>out of context there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

779
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

780
00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:07.980
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that feels like have a new role.</v>

781
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:08.990
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

782
00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Well it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

783
00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:14.310
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the left is turning on itself.</v>

784
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:19.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are people that are turning</v>
<v Speaker 2>on them so there you cannot be </v>

785
00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:23.421
<v Speaker 2>progressive enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no one out there that's </v>

786
00:38:23.421 --> 00:38:25.431
<v Speaker 2>progressive enough and so there's always</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna be someone to find some fault in </v>

787
00:38:25.431 --> 00:38:29.271
<v Speaker 2>something that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly if you're doing fiction </v>

788
00:38:29.271 --> 00:38:32.220
<v Speaker 2>that portrays a realistic scenarios that</v>
<v Speaker 2>could easily exist in any city,</v>

789
00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:33.870
<v Speaker 2>in any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

790
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.580
<v Speaker 2>civilization on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

791
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:37.960
<v Speaker 2>And I noticed when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

792
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was covering all of this for a</v>

793
00:38:39.581 --> 00:38:40.930
<v Speaker 2>couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>months writing,</v>

794
00:38:40.931 --> 00:38:45.931
<v Speaker 2>so you've been publicly shamed and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I noticed that every time somebody </v>

795
00:38:45.931 --> 00:38:47.290
<v Speaker 2>like justine sacco got kinda got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got on the Internet,</v>

796
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:51.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Breitbart and info wars,</v>

797
00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Molly Annapolis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Joseph Watson,</v>

798
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

799
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:56.860
<v Speaker 2>they would propagandize the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>

800
00:38:56.861 --> 00:38:59.560
<v Speaker 2>And this was in the runup to trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting elected.</v>

801
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.560
<v Speaker 2>And I can't help thinking that the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating itself is part of the reason why </v>

802
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.720
<v Speaker 2>we've got trump now really fucked up for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

803
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:12.721
<v Speaker 2>They became unreasonable when there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>meme that's going out there that I've </v>

804
00:39:12.941 --> 00:39:17.941
<v Speaker 2>seen on many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many different places on instagram and </v>

805
00:39:17.941 --> 00:39:21.090
<v Speaker 2>twitter and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says this kind of shit is why I got </v>

806
00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:24.031
<v Speaker 2>elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's trump like pointing at the </v>

807
00:39:24.031 --> 00:39:24.031
<v Speaker 2>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's true.</v>

808
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.940
<v Speaker 2>It's 100 percent true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were fed up,</v>

809
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.110
<v Speaker 2>they're fed up and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

810
00:39:29.111 --> 00:39:31.300
<v Speaker 2>they didn't realize what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences are.</v>

811
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:36.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's really fascinating is I saw this </v>

812
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:38.401
<v Speaker 2>article today where it was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>America was on cnn about Americans,</v>

813
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:42.110
<v Speaker 2>like in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everyone pulled,</v>

814
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:47.160
<v Speaker 2>does not like the fact that trump tweets</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some crazy number people to think </v>

815
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.331
<v Speaker 2>that he should stop tweeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that got him </v>

816
00:39:51.331 --> 00:39:54.400
<v Speaker 2>elected is the fact that he tweets said </v>
<v Speaker 2>people enjoyed it.</v>

817
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a guy who fighting back and he's,</v>

818
00:39:57.501 --> 00:40:02.501
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not scared to hit back with </v>

819
00:40:02.501 --> 00:40:05.731
<v Speaker 2>personal insults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like we'd never seen that before </v>

820
00:40:05.731 --> 00:40:06.190
<v Speaker 2>from someone running for president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this was stunning.</v>

821
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

822
00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:10.030
<v Speaker 2>but then he became president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's like,</v>

823
00:40:10.031 --> 00:40:15.031
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll surely let that go once he's in </v>

824
00:40:15.031 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 2>the office because that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidential.</v>

825
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.420
<v Speaker 2>But he used the expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

826
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the expression,</v>

827
00:40:20.471 --> 00:40:22.780
<v Speaker 2>but something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's modern presidential.</v>

828
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

829
00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the very first book I ever </v>

830
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:32.620
<v Speaker 2>did for seed been purposely saying there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was this woman in front row,</v>

831
00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of elderly lady.</v>

832
00:40:34.601 --> 00:40:39.601
<v Speaker 2>This was the book shop Santa Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was like pointedly shaking her </v>

833
00:40:40.241 --> 00:40:43.300
<v Speaker 2>head and disagreements with everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was saying.</v>

834
00:40:43.301 --> 00:40:45.190
<v Speaker 2>And then when it came to the q and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

835
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:46.480
<v Speaker 2>I haven't got any questions that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>went.</v>

836
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:48.580
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

837
00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.180
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

838
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I just said if you play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

839
00:40:51.821 --> 00:40:56.821
<v Speaker 2>if you play with the twitter toy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your fault if you get what I'm,</v>

840
00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.630
<v Speaker 2>what I said to him was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

841
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.570
<v Speaker 2>it's influences beyond twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twitter is,</v>

842
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:09.790
<v Speaker 2>twitter is infecting the culture and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an infected everything.</v>

843
00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:13.780
<v Speaker 2>What the Gan on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new type of discourse and the new way of</v>

844
00:41:13.781 --> 00:41:17.740
<v Speaker 2>seeing each other infected politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

845
00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:20.650
<v Speaker 2>the mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's affected everything in the same way</v>

846
00:41:20.651 --> 00:41:25.651
<v Speaker 2>that I wonder where the Fabian fs sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of feels a bit guilty about some of the </v>

847
00:41:25.651 --> 00:41:28.330
<v Speaker 2>consequences of his business plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder whether some of the,</v>

848
00:41:28.331 --> 00:41:33.331
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter executives ever feel guilty </v>

849
00:41:33.331 --> 00:41:33.380
<v Speaker 2>about what they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

850
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 2>they certainly</v>

851
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.650
<v Speaker 1>feel like they have some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

852
00:41:36.651 --> 00:41:38.960
<v Speaker 1>which is why their silencing certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

853
00:41:38.961 --> 00:41:41.540
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if shadow banning is </v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

854
00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:46.541
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all this talk of people being </v>

855
00:41:46.541 --> 00:41:47.810
<v Speaker 1>shadow band and then a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have had their accounts suspended.</v>

856
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said they got doing a bit of stuff </v>

857
00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:52.900
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a member,</v>

858
00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:52.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism.</v>

859
00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:53.240
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

860
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Westboro Baptist Church Mckee who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine and she,</v>

861
00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she came on your show.</v>

862
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:02.100
<v Speaker 1>She was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's so great.</v>

863
00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating that someone who came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a horrible regressive environment </v>

864
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.200
<v Speaker 1>became this fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really intelligent,</v>

865
00:42:09.201 --> 00:42:11.120
<v Speaker 1>really well-spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive person.</v>

866
00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 1>And I think Meghan would say if she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there because I kind of said </v>

867
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:17.630
<v Speaker 1>that at one time and she said it sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to show that,</v>

868
00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full,</v>

869
00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.350
<v Speaker 1>full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of hateful beliefs.</v>

870
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.070
<v Speaker 1>My parents were good parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they gave me this positive stuff as</v>

871
00:42:25.071 --> 00:42:25.880
<v Speaker 1>well as the nicotine.</v>

872
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That amazing.</v>

873
00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:28.770
<v Speaker 1>She can't even talk to them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

874
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.120
<v Speaker 1>But they won't talk to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to her.</v>

875
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:36.220
<v Speaker 1>I think she went up to them at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a picture of David Bowie's memorials.</v>

876
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't talk.</v>

877
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:41.480
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't look her in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anyway,</v>

878
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:44.450
<v Speaker 1>she was on the phone to twitter one time</v>
<v Speaker 1>she told me,</v>

879
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they love it.</v>

880
00:42:45.831 --> 00:42:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter love that because she hadn't,</v>

881
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.570
<v Speaker 1>she sort of got talked into liberals on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter and that's,</v>

882
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:55.220
<v Speaker 1>that's what persuaded or perhaps if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Westboro Baptist church.</v>

883
00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.380
<v Speaker 1>So for twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the best story in the world.</v>

884
00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:02.650
<v Speaker 1>So she was talking to Theresa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she told me and they wanted her to do a </v>

885
00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:02.650
<v Speaker 1>talk and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

886
00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:04.250
<v Speaker 1>you should do a talk as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Ronson.</v>

887
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.940
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said twitter went quiet and phone.</v>

888
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Speaker 1>So they're upset at you and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset.</v>

889
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:13.010
<v Speaker 1>It may for basically pointing out what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

890
00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:18.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how will total is crawling towards the </v>

891
00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:18.520
<v Speaker 1>gun on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

892
00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.310
<v Speaker 1>that it's not all people.</v>

893
00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.940
<v Speaker 1>What you're see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pointing out some of the issues </v>

894
00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:25.760
<v Speaker 1>that many other people have seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not what you don't think.</v>

895
00:43:25.761 --> 00:43:27.320
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying is controversial at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

896
00:43:27.321 --> 00:43:29.230
<v Speaker 1>You're just astute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so that,</v>

897
00:43:29.231 --> 00:43:34.231
<v Speaker 1>that story about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about justine sacco a few years ago and </v>

898
00:43:34.231 --> 00:43:34.231
<v Speaker 1>about how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

899
00:43:34.231 --> 00:43:36.200
<v Speaker 1>the woman who tweeted going to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope I don't get aids,</v>

900
00:43:36.201 --> 00:43:37.400
<v Speaker 1>just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm white.</v>

901
00:43:37.401 --> 00:43:40.680
<v Speaker 1>And then when she was pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was asleep on the plane,</v>

902
00:43:40.681 --> 00:43:43.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking she'd made a smart cut of south</v>

903
00:43:43.191 --> 00:43:47.590
<v Speaker 1>park joke around privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyone united to choose,</v>

904
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.940
<v Speaker 1>fired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fired by the time she landed.</v>

905
00:43:49.941 --> 00:43:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

906
00:43:51.351 --> 00:43:56.351
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone from like misogynistic troves </v>

907
00:43:56.351 --> 00:43:59.000
<v Speaker 1>through to social justice people all </v>
<v Speaker 1>united to destroy this urban,</v>

908
00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:02.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she upset everyone for um,</v>

909
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:04.160
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

910
00:44:04.161 --> 00:44:09.161
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that story became pretty </v>

911
00:44:09.161 --> 00:44:10.961
<v Speaker 1>powerful at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it probably back to </v>

912
00:44:10.961 --> 00:44:10.961
<v Speaker 1>twitter's business for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People got too scared to go into it.</v>

913
00:44:10.961 --> 00:44:14.840
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's a drop their business </v>
<v Speaker 1>off at all.</v>

914
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

915
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:20.810
<v Speaker 1>I think people started to think that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>may have recovered now,</v>

916
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.420
<v Speaker 1>but I think people started to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

917
00:44:22.421 --> 00:44:24.590
<v Speaker 1>if twitter is not fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

918
00:44:24.591 --> 00:44:29.591
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the point of the Justine Sacco </v>

919
00:44:29.591 --> 00:44:32.220
<v Speaker 1>one racist joke that she got fired for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that really had an overall</v>

920
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.350
<v Speaker 2>effect on twitter use?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

921
00:44:34.351 --> 00:44:39.351
<v Speaker 2>what happened was I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my book got extracted in the New York </v>

922
00:44:39.351 --> 00:44:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Times did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that story.</v>

923
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:43.060
<v Speaker 2>And that story kind of went crazy viral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

924
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.850
<v Speaker 2>it really spoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of spoke to people.</v>

925
00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like Duh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like deep fears,</v>

926
00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:50.540
<v Speaker 2>that story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

927
00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:53.010
<v Speaker 2>deep fears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might get drunk and pop a Xanax and</v>

928
00:44:53.011 --> 00:44:54.920
<v Speaker 2>say something really stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did the same shit,</v>

929
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:56.970
<v Speaker 2>wake up in Africa fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

930
00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:02.060
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that kind of public </v>

931
00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:02.250
<v Speaker 2>effected twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it did.</v>

932
00:45:02.251 --> 00:45:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I think they need to relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all that stuff just makes people</v>

933
00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:08.520
<v Speaker 2>interested and then it makes more people</v>
<v Speaker 2>sign up and I just,</v>

934
00:45:08.521 --> 00:45:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

935
00:45:09.691 --> 00:45:12.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they were upset at you over that,</v>

936
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:14.570
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>

937
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:18.750
<v Speaker 2>I've given.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave talks at facebook and Google,</v>

938
00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.650
<v Speaker 2>but they won't give you a talk going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm curious.</v>

939
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:27.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious for their orwellian council </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe they'll go over every word </v>

940
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
<v Speaker 2>you're about to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allow what is their trust and verify </v>

941
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.210
<v Speaker 2>council,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that called?</v>

942
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Where they have all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have some people on that are that </v>

943
00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:38.880
<v Speaker 2>are ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social Justice Warriors,</v>

944
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:42.390
<v Speaker 2>proven attention whores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that are dishonest.</v>

945
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:47.420
<v Speaker 2>They're just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not honest people and they're a </v>

946
00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:49.661
<v Speaker 2>part of this whole thing where their </v>
<v Speaker 2>business is getting attention and being </v>

947
00:45:49.661 --> 00:45:52.380
<v Speaker 2>a victim and and exploring it to the nth</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>

948
00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:52.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

949
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.960
<v Speaker 2>that's a bunch of people that are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>

950
00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think like if you're gonna address </v>

951
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.920
<v Speaker 2>harassment on social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to accept that it comes from </v>

952
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.640
<v Speaker 2>both sides and the right to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes from the left to the right.</v>

953
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:08.790
<v Speaker 2>It comes to misogynists feminists that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from feminist.</v>

954
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.810
<v Speaker 2>You also have to define what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>harassment and what is criticism.</v>

955
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have ideas in the open </v>

956
00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.641
<v Speaker 2>marketplace of ideas and you have ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people think are profoundly </v>

957
00:46:19.641 --> 00:46:21.000
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're allowed to mock your ideas.</v>

958
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:26.030
<v Speaker 2>That is not harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that that is someone </v>

959
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:27.840
<v Speaker 2>shitting on you and you put yourself out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

960
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially someone whose hook.</v>

961
00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:32.280
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people,</v>

962
00:46:32.281 --> 00:46:34.290
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not singers,</v>

963
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.440
<v Speaker 2>they're not authors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not musicians,</v>

964
00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:39.060
<v Speaker 2>they're not comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

965
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:42.750
<v Speaker 2>They're not producing anything other </v>
<v Speaker 2>than their words.</v>

966
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if someone doesn't like your words </v>

967
00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.230
<v Speaker 2>and they shit on your words like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else do you expect?</v>

968
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that there was some kind of </v>

969
00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.320
<v Speaker 2>gaslighting going on on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

970
00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.430
<v Speaker 2>like everyone would agree that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that I come from,</v>

971
00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:04.431
<v Speaker 2>not the Guardian and the left La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone would agree that if a gun of </v>

972
00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.670
<v Speaker 2>Bissell actionists sort of gang up on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular feminist writer and basically</v>

973
00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.720
<v Speaker 2>harassed until she goes flying every new</v>
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>

974
00:47:11.721 --> 00:47:13.770
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bad and is bad.</v>

975
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.210
<v Speaker 2>It is yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

976
00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:18.330
<v Speaker 2>but when the mirror image of that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

977
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:22.260
<v Speaker 2>people pretended as if people just </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretend it's not happening.</v>

978
00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When someone goes after someone on the </v>

979
00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:27.280
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's a woman like,</v>

980
00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a perfect example of that was no </v>

981
00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:32.170
<v Speaker 2>feminist stood up to defend Sarah </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pailin.</v>

982
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you never heard that when Bill </v>

983
00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:40.770
<v Speaker 2>Maher was calling her a cunt and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these different people were mocking her </v>

984
00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:42.070
<v Speaker 2>and no one was stepping up and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

985
00:47:42.071 --> 00:47:44.110
<v Speaker 2>that's a woman that's a mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

986
00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:45.940
<v Speaker 2>it's someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's mom,</v>

987
00:47:45.941 --> 00:47:50.941
<v Speaker 2>like leave her alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have some respect for women if you're a </v>

988
00:47:50.941 --> 00:47:53.380
<v Speaker 2>woman and you're a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you might as well be a monster man.</v>

989
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:58.710
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was undoubtedly sort of cognitive </v>

990
00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:59.680
<v Speaker 2>dissonance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

991
00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:05.370
<v Speaker 1>when somebody's being harassed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to then see themselves </v>

992
00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:05.370
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

993
00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.350
<v Speaker 1>as doing the same thing to a group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that they don't like.</v>

994
00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to come to think of </v>

995
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.580
<v Speaker 2>someone who is opposed to your point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>view or thinks of things completely </v>

996
00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:19.721
<v Speaker 2>different as another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even think of them as a </v>

997
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:19.721
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that happened to me,</v>

998
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:20.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to</v>

999
00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.340
<v Speaker 1>said that they wanted to run a series of</v>
<v Speaker 1>articles about,</v>

1000
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:29.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about bullying on the Internet and </v>

1001
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:29.720
<v Speaker 1>wanted me to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1002
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:34.680
<v Speaker 1>contribute to the series a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they said they wanted it to all be </v>

1003
00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.070
<v Speaker 1>about how women are being bullied by </v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

1004
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:38.410
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1005
00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:40.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no doubt that,</v>

1006
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:44.680
<v Speaker 1>that happens a lot and it's presumably </v>
<v Speaker 1>disproportionate.</v>

1007
00:48:44.681 --> 00:48:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Like women are bullied by men more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>other groups have bullied.</v>

1008
00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:49.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could well be true,</v>

1009
00:48:49.541 --> 00:48:53.380
<v Speaker 1>but if the series of article is only </v>
<v Speaker 1>about women being bullied by Merlin,</v>

1010
00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:58.740
<v Speaker 1>legitimize a certain types of bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when the left pile in on somebody </v>

1011
00:48:58.740 --> 00:48:59.500
<v Speaker 1>like just in soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to legitimize,</v>

1012
00:48:59.501 --> 00:49:04.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if it's that partial is going to </v>

1013
00:49:04.501 --> 00:49:04.501
<v Speaker 1>legitimize certain types of bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the editor,</v>

1014
00:49:04.501 --> 00:49:08.290
<v Speaker 1>when I said that to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of rolled her eyes as if to say,</v>

1015
00:49:08.291 --> 00:49:10.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think that erm,</v>

1016
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:11.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1017
00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:12.880
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true,</v>

1018
00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:13.580
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1019
00:49:13.581 --> 00:49:16.360
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem's not going to go until we.</v>

1020
00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hypocrites.</v>

1021
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's essentially what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1022
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.970
<v Speaker 2>So people don't want to be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1023
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:26.990
<v Speaker 2>they think that there's power and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shaming and they think.</v>

1024
00:49:26.991 --> 00:49:31.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had multiple conversations with </v>

1025
00:49:31.991 --> 00:49:33.020
<v Speaker 2>people online that think there is good </v>
<v Speaker 2>in shaming people.</v>

1026
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you saying that because you're </v>

1027
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.230
<v Speaker 2>hiding behind a keyboard and it's a free</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot,</v>

1028
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:41.000
<v Speaker 2>but if you had to sit down with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>person in front of them and talk to them</v>

1029
00:49:41.001 --> 00:49:44.660
<v Speaker 2>face to face and feel the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

1030
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It reminds me actually remember I was </v>

1031
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:51.641
<v Speaker 2>telling you about what are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences that I look at in the best </v>

1032
00:49:51.641 --> 00:49:54.791
<v Speaker 2>of fly effect about the tech takeover of</v>
<v Speaker 2>port is that if you're a 25 year old </v>

1033
00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:55.580
<v Speaker 2>adult actress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get work now because you're in</v>

1034
00:49:55.581 --> 00:49:58.580
<v Speaker 2>this sort of hinterland between teen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>MILF.</v>

1035
00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.560
<v Speaker 2>And I kept that.</v>

1036
00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:01.340
<v Speaker 2>That's not just pawn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the Internet.</v>

1037
00:50:01.341 --> 00:50:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Like on social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1038
00:50:02.481 --> 00:50:05.090
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're kind of loud,</v>

1039
00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:10.480
<v Speaker 2>aggressively authoritarian person on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left or the loud aggressively </v>

1040
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.680
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian person on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like the teen or the MILF like those</v>

1041
00:50:12.681 --> 00:50:15.950
<v Speaker 2>of us in the middle of these people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are more interested in people talking to</v>

1042
00:50:15.951 --> 00:50:17.630
<v Speaker 2>each other and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't,</v>

1043
00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.750
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to like scream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to listen to understand.</v>

1044
00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:23.900
<v Speaker 2>We like the 25 year old adult film </v>
<v Speaker 2>actress at work.</v>

1045
00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't like nuanced point of view </v>

1046
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:28.960
<v Speaker 2>and they also like people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing</v>

1047
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:29.650
<v Speaker 3>to talk to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1048
00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:34.660
<v Speaker 3>I've had so many people call me some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a right wing monster and I'm </v>

1049
00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:34.820
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1050
00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:37.400
<v Speaker 3>let's go over what makes a right wing </v>
<v Speaker 3>monster.</v>

1051
00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:37.820
<v Speaker 3>W,</v>
<v Speaker 3>W,</v>

1052
00:50:37.821 --> 00:50:41.430
<v Speaker 3>w what is right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I support gay marriage support.</v>

1053
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Universal health care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm absolutely in favor.</v>

1054
00:50:46.191 --> 00:50:51.191
<v Speaker 3>If it could work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it would work of a </v>

1055
00:50:51.191 --> 00:50:51.680
<v Speaker 3>universal basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where does it,</v>

1056
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.710
<v Speaker 3>where do I become right wing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

1057
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.700
<v Speaker 3>Where does it go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm anti war.</v>

1058
00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:57.520
<v Speaker 3>Like where do I become right when?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1059
00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:02.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I can in politics as input</v>
<v Speaker 3>on everything now has to be kind of </v>

1060
00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:06.551
<v Speaker 3>keywords that Chabot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everybody has to fall into some sort </v>

1061
00:51:06.551 --> 00:51:07.160
<v Speaker 3>of nation and if you're not doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

1062
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:08.960
<v Speaker 3>then someone else is gonna do it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1063
00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even when you're saying that like </v>

1064
00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:14.020
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not real.</v>

1065
00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:17.800
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to fall into those </v>

1066
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.781
<v Speaker 3>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just be easier for people to </v>

1067
00:51:19.781 --> 00:51:19.781
<v Speaker 3>categorize you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you did fall into those categories.</v>

1068
00:51:19.781 --> 00:51:24.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I have some points of view that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would consider a conservative and</v>

1069
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:30.551
<v Speaker 3>I have many more points of view that </v>
<v Speaker 3>most people would consider to be </v>

1070
00:51:30.551 --> 00:51:31.220
<v Speaker 3>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's very convenient,</v>

1071
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:36.430
<v Speaker 3>especially when you look like me and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked like a meathead is easy to say </v>

1072
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:40.631
<v Speaker 3>that I'm some meathead conservative or </v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing or something along those </v>

1073
00:51:40.631 --> 00:51:43.931
<v Speaker 3>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm way more likely to vote for </v>

1074
00:51:43.931 --> 00:51:46.310
<v Speaker 3>someone on the left than I am for </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone on the right because I think the</v>

1075
00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:50.660
<v Speaker 3>people on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jen in general are more suppressive.</v>

1076
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Especially socially and culturally and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that's where the real issues.</v>

1077
00:51:54.231 --> 00:51:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Like when you look at like Obama did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1078
00:51:57.091 --> 00:51:57.650
<v Speaker 3>on the right.</v>

1079
00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:03.100
<v Speaker 3>When you look at what Obama did in </v>
<v Speaker 3>office in terms of like what he did as </v>

1080
00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:07.901
<v Speaker 3>far as drones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a freedom of the press and going on </v>

1081
00:52:07.901 --> 00:52:10.670
<v Speaker 3>after whistle blowers and got a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was very right.</v>

1082
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:15.700
<v Speaker 3>Very right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you looked at in terms of like an </v>

1083
00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:16.070
<v Speaker 3>actual real consequences of him being </v>
<v Speaker 3>the president,</v>

1084
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:21.370
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it was very right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you look at in terms of like </v>

1085
00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:25.240
<v Speaker 3>support for gay marriage and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in passing the affordable care act and </v>

1086
00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:30.131
<v Speaker 3>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of that stuff was very </v>

1087
00:52:30.131 --> 00:52:31.991
<v Speaker 3>left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I don't know if the affordable care </v>

1088
00:52:31.991 --> 00:52:32.840
<v Speaker 3>act was good because a lot of small </v>
<v Speaker 3>businesses,</v>

1089
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:38.170
<v Speaker 3>the small doctors with small offices </v>
<v Speaker 3>hated it and thought it was absolutely </v>

1090
00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:42.041
<v Speaker 3>horrible and it killed their business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who's right about that </v>

1091
00:52:42.041 --> 00:52:44.831
<v Speaker 3>because I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I don't have to deal with </v>

1092
00:52:44.831 --> 00:52:44.831
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1093
00:52:44.831 --> 00:52:45.710
<v Speaker 3>It's a controversial subject,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea behind it I liked.</v>

1094
00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:50.800
<v Speaker 3>I liked the idea that we would have some</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of universal healthcare because I </v>

1095
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.741
<v Speaker 3>think the idea of someone being too poor</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get healthcare in this incredible </v>

1096
00:52:53.991 --> 00:52:56.540
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if we're going to pay for our taxes</v>

1097
00:52:56.541 --> 00:52:58.830
<v Speaker 3>are going to go to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn doesn't.</v>

1098
00:52:58.831 --> 00:53:01.600
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't go to caring for our </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighbors and our,</v>

1099
00:53:01.601 --> 00:53:06.601
<v Speaker 3>our fellow humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that seems to me to be a no </v>

1100
00:53:06.601 --> 00:53:06.601
<v Speaker 3>brainer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1101
00:53:06.601 --> 00:53:08.900
<v Speaker 3>and that's probably a pretty left wing </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea why I got a ton of those,</v>

1102
00:53:08.901 --> 00:53:13.901
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's easy to call me a right winger </v>

1103
00:53:13.901 --> 00:53:16.660
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that fascinating that people do </v>

1104
00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:20.861
<v Speaker 3>not like us a nuanced approach or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

1105
00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:26.380
<v Speaker 3>it's not that they don't like it is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they find it extremely easy to </v>

1106
00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:26.380
<v Speaker 3>categorize</v>

1107
00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:29.790
<v Speaker 1>you and so we're sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a negative caricature.</v>

1108
00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1109
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.650
<v Speaker 1>I've got a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like totally change the subject</v>

1110
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:35.950
<v Speaker 1>for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1111
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:41.480
<v Speaker 1>we have Alex Jones a common cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago snuck into Bohemian Grove with</v>

1112
00:53:41.671 --> 00:53:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Alec and weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was that,</v>

1113
00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:47.310
<v Speaker 1>that was like the one he didn't like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>late nineties,</v>

1114
00:53:47.311 --> 00:53:50.280
<v Speaker 1>early 2019.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are with them on that.</v>

1115
00:53:50.281 --> 00:53:51.210
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1116
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:54.960
<v Speaker 1>we talked about that the last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1117
00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1118
00:53:56.611 --> 00:53:58.470
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since I saw you last,</v>

1119
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I rekindled my relationship with Alex as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a means of trying to get inside the </v>

1120
00:54:04.801 --> 00:54:07.890
<v Speaker 1>trump world didn't go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't go great.</v>

1121
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.350
<v Speaker 1>It didn't go well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened that?</v>

1122
00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I think I heard Alex a little bit,</v>

1123
00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:15.330
<v Speaker 1>although would you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically set allocation.</v>

1124
00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Have political sway you told him that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1125
00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I wrote it in a story about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the RNC and I sort of,</v>

1126
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:27.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got back in with Alex and spent a little</v>

1127
00:54:27.301 --> 00:54:32.301
<v Speaker 1>bit of time hanging around with him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger Stone and so on and got really </v>

1128
00:54:32.301 --> 00:54:35.751
<v Speaker 1>interested in the kind of dynamics of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how Alex and trevor communicate to each </v>

1129
00:54:35.751 --> 00:54:39.651
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm wondering if you've seen Alex </v>

1130
00:54:39.651 --> 00:54:41.160
<v Speaker 1>more recently than I have been my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends since 1998.</v>

1131
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at his custody trial not long ago.</v>

1132
00:54:43.501 --> 00:54:48.501
<v Speaker 1>And you were brought up by my shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was smoking pot.</v>

1133
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Just testing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Soros makes the weeds stronger.</v>

1134
00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:56.280
<v Speaker 1>That's very steady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that in this custody trial.</v>

1135
00:54:56.281 --> 00:54:59.820
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he tests it once a year just to.</v>

1136
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Because he's weird because he's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>here when that happened.</v>

1137
00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

1138
00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:15.050
<v Speaker 1>What's really funny is we drank whiskey </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the show too and no one gives a shit </v>

1139
00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:15.150
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way more destructive.</v>

1140
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:17.400
<v Speaker 1>It's the pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is.</v>

1141
00:55:17.401 --> 00:55:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Self reflective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1142
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inducing marijuana.</v>

1143
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1144
00:55:24.021 --> 00:55:29.021
<v Speaker 1>I now wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he says that trump called him just </v>

1145
00:55:29.021 --> 00:55:32.031
<v Speaker 1>after the election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just thank him and I'm inclined to </v>

1146
00:55:32.031 --> 00:55:33.480
<v Speaker 1>believe that's true because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's the kind of thing that Alex</v>

1147
00:55:33.481 --> 00:55:38.481
<v Speaker 1>would lie about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but have you got any of you come to any </v>

1148
00:55:38.481 --> 00:55:40.650
<v Speaker 1>conclusion about whether there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection between Alex and trump now?</v>

1149
00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm beginning to think maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>there just isn't anymore,</v>

1150
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:45.600
<v Speaker 1>but I could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a good question.</v>

1151
00:55:45.601 --> 00:55:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1152
00:55:46.741 --> 00:55:51.741
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how trump can have a </v>

1153
00:55:51.741 --> 00:55:54.531
<v Speaker 1>connection with that many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the job of being the </v>

1154
00:55:54.531 --> 00:55:57.240
<v Speaker 1>president has got to be so insanely </v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding.</v>

1155
00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:00.090
<v Speaker 1>The idea that he likes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's taken a few moments out of his day.</v>

1156
00:56:00.091 --> 00:56:04.070
<v Speaker 1>He's got his feet up on the chair with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>laptop and he's on infowars.com.</v>

1157
00:56:04.071 --> 00:56:04.650
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>

1158
00:56:04.651 --> 00:56:09.651
<v Speaker 1>I got to call it Alex and find out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck's going on with this child </v>

1159
00:56:09.651 --> 00:56:13.400
<v Speaker 1>slavery thing on Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know where the slaves tell me where </v>

1160
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:20.240
<v Speaker 1>we're on Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it benefits everyone to think </v>

1161
00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.450
<v Speaker 1>that it's because it makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes trump look bad,</v>

1162
00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.730
<v Speaker 1>so it benefits people on the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>descending that Alex is a,</v>

1163
00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:29.050
<v Speaker 1>is connected to trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of benefits Alex.</v>

1164
00:56:29.051 --> 00:56:31.810
<v Speaker 1>I think for people to think it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because grand dies is,</v>

1165
00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:35.230
<v Speaker 1>it helps him in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like the people that.</v>

1166
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of people that enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex,</v>

1167
00:56:37.571 --> 00:56:42.571
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of them enjoy it for the </v>

1168
00:56:42.571 --> 00:56:44.050
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a theater element of it all,</v>

1169
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:44.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1170
00:56:44.911 --> 00:56:47.210
<v Speaker 1>and it's all doom and gloom and.</v>

1171
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then some of it,</v>

1172
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000
<v Speaker 1>some people enjoy because like Bohemian </v>
<v Speaker 1>grove occasionally he's correct.</v>

1173
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Like Bohemian Grove was a real mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1174
00:56:57.030 --> 00:57:01.120
<v Speaker 1>And you see all these super rich people </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing robes in effigy.</v>

1175
00:57:01.121 --> 00:57:06.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the crowd with all the old men </v>

1176
00:57:06.121 --> 00:57:06.760
<v Speaker 1>of wealth in Dallas to freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And soon as people,</v>

1177
00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.480
<v Speaker 1>one thing freaked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1178
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Alex came out of our Bohemian Grove </v>
<v Speaker 1>Knight with a,</v>

1179
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:17.910
<v Speaker 1>with varying interpretation of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>

1180
00:57:18.281 --> 00:57:22.230
<v Speaker 1>My interpretation is basically with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with one caveat caveat there,</v>

1181
00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:26.860
<v Speaker 1>my interpretation was that it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like fucking skull and bones.</v>

1182
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:30.580
<v Speaker 1>So those were all creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1183
00:57:30.581 --> 00:57:35.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they want to devastate that just </v>

1184
00:57:35.581 --> 00:57:35.581
<v Speaker 1>seem to be amongst the American ruling </v>
<v Speaker 1>elites,</v>

1185
00:57:35.581 --> 00:57:38.620
<v Speaker 1>that does seem to be a proclivity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>ritual.</v>

1186
00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

1187
00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe monks of British elites as well.</v>

1188
00:57:41.711 --> 00:57:46.711
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's in itself psychologically </v>

1189
00:57:46.711 --> 00:57:46.711
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1190
00:57:46.711 --> 00:57:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Think secrets too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1191
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:48.100
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1192
00:57:48.101 --> 00:57:53.101
<v Speaker 1>So that is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why even if the ritual at Bohemian </v>

1193
00:57:53.101 --> 00:57:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Grove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1194
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1195
00:57:54.131 --> 00:57:59.131
<v Speaker 1>and I would contend that country to alex</v>
<v Speaker 1>implied they weren't actually </v>

1196
00:57:59.681 --> 00:58:01.080
<v Speaker 1>sacrificing a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1197
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:04.010
<v Speaker 1>he didn't say they were sacrificing your</v>
<v Speaker 1>chart at some point.</v>

1198
00:58:04.011 --> 00:58:05.350
<v Speaker 1>And then this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1199
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:08.940
<v Speaker 1>it couldn't be real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be real.</v>

1200
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:14.220
<v Speaker 1>He probably was so jazzed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were actually dressed up like </v>

1201
00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 1>monks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He with the hoods and they have the mall</v>

1202
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:15.670
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our God,</v>

1203
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:20.850
<v Speaker 1>when he was actually there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that probably ramped up his love </v>

1204
00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:23.650
<v Speaker 1>of conspiracy a good solid three or 400 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

1205
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:27.040
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went in separately to to,</v>

1206
00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:32.740
<v Speaker 1>because Alex got it into his head that </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I was part of the Bohemian Grove </v>

1207
00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:36.540
<v Speaker 1>deep deep inside that I was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning events seven.</v>

1208
00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:41.070
<v Speaker 1>He would be the ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he went in separately to be,</v>

1209
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:45.430
<v Speaker 1>he won't and fire the undergrowth and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went up to the drive in the driveway.</v>

1210
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:50.430
<v Speaker 1>I gave the security guy to cut a viral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world wave and then we went in </v>

1211
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.950
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her Toyota do.</v>

1212
00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1213
00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:54.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys,</v>

1214
00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:56.170
<v Speaker 1>so often the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:01.440
<v Speaker 1>So the White House and then we saw Alex </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mike Hanson who was his producer at </v>

1216
00:59:02.081 --> 00:59:04.540
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking like towards this and I was with</v>

1217
00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:07.570
<v Speaker 1>this local lawyer who would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would we talked up with?</v>

1218
00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1219
00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Hey Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

1220
00:59:11.351 --> 00:59:12.880
<v Speaker 1>how you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

1221
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:16.030
<v Speaker 1>keep walking as cameras and the chase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This owl was everywhere.</v>

1222
00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:17.950
<v Speaker 1>And then there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1223
00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.410
<v Speaker 1>because we felt like the hours were </v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras.</v>

1224
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.750
<v Speaker 1>They got it into their heads that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>owls at Bohemian Grove,</v>

1225
00:59:23.751 --> 00:59:28.751
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our motifs that Bohemian Grove a was </v>

1226
00:59:28.751 --> 00:59:30.350
<v Speaker 1>indicative of the fact that it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>moloch the owl God,</v>

1227
00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:33.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was like some sort of satanic.</v>

1228
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:38.410
<v Speaker 1>But actually I would say that the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>why there's all those hours because I </v>

1229
00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:41.390
<v Speaker 1>saw like stuffed owls and display </v>
<v Speaker 1>cabinets and so on.</v>

1230
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.940
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an owl sanctuary.</v>

1231
00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:48.560
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

1232
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:51.320
<v Speaker 1>but I want to put all this stuff done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1233
00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I presume it died of natural causes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1234
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.490
<v Speaker 1>He fucking sanctuary if they kill it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then stuff it.</v>

1235
00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:02.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's sorta like a norman bates mom </v>
<v Speaker 1>and psycho stuff.</v>

1236
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:07.990
<v Speaker 1>But what was odd that night was one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that the artist moment,</v>

1237
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:14.950
<v Speaker 1>and this is where I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where my memory of the night </v>

1238
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:17.981
<v Speaker 1>does tally with Alex's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that for whatever reason the people </v>

1239
01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>in the crowd were really into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ceremony.</v>

1240
01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.880
<v Speaker 1>There was a sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were really fired up by it.</v>

1241
01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Let say I remember this old guy walked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to me before it started and you first</v>

1242
01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>timer and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1243
01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:33.110
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1244
01:00:33.111 --> 01:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>you got to love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>

1245
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burn him,</v>

1246
01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.580
<v Speaker 1>burn him or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines.</v>

1247
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1248
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:45.190
<v Speaker 1>and it did make me think la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I looked behind and there was </v>

1249
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.550
<v Speaker 1>alex and Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why died looking like they will ruin,</v>

1250
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:50.630
<v Speaker 1>know the belly of the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all these old preppy </v>

1251
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.630
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why died?</v>

1252
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Did they were really into it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like the only sane person in the </v>

1253
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:55.010
<v Speaker 1>entire redwood forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1254
01:00:55.011 --> 01:00:57.080
<v Speaker 1>the only person who's thinking this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking ridiculous.</v>

1255
01:00:57.690 --> 01:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>It is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1256
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.760
<v Speaker 1>but they were into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was that moment.</v>

1257
01:01:01.761 --> 01:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>It was that moment of revelation </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

1258
01:01:03.351 --> 01:01:07.310
<v Speaker 1>that then led me to write the book that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote after that book,</v>

1259
01:01:07.311 --> 01:01:09.350
<v Speaker 1>which was the minister at goats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was about,</v>

1260
01:01:09.351 --> 01:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1261
01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>soldiers tried to kill goats just by </v>
<v Speaker 1>staring at them because I remember like,</v>

1262
01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:18.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking I was actually,</v>

1263
01:01:18.381 --> 01:01:21.140
<v Speaker 1>I was in Belfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was giving a talk about my book then,</v>

1264
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.420
<v Speaker 1>which is where we talk about all of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1265
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:24.620
<v Speaker 1>And it simply said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1266
01:01:24.621 --> 01:01:27.110
<v Speaker 1>so I know what you think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This woman in the audience said,</v>

1267
01:01:27.111 --> 01:01:32.111
<v Speaker 1>I know what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you think this is ridiculous and </v>

1268
01:01:32.111 --> 01:01:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I know that Alex Jones thinks it's evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about the people in the crowd?</v>

1269
01:01:34.071 --> 01:01:39.071
<v Speaker 1>What were they thinking about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that's a really good </v>

1270
01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:41.111
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what led me to write a book </v>

1271
01:01:41.111 --> 01:01:41.240
<v Speaker 1>about like a rational thoughts in </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful places,</v>

1272
01:01:41.241 --> 01:01:42.820
<v Speaker 1>which is what led me to adminster guts.</v>

1273
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:44.890
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

1274
01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:49.920
<v Speaker 2>when you're there and you see that there</v>
<v Speaker 2>really is a giant stone owl and they </v>

1275
01:01:50.471 --> 01:01:55.471
<v Speaker 2>really do have this bundle of sticks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're burning and everyone really is </v>

1276
01:01:55.471 --> 01:01:56.140
<v Speaker 2>wearing these robes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1277
01:01:57.310 --> 01:01:59.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean you had a part of you how to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1278
01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:03.100
<v Speaker 2>how many of these fucking things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on that we have an infiltrated?</v>

1279
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Well that's true that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a photo over there.</v>

1280
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:11.910
<v Speaker 2>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they really do have a giant owl </v>

1281
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:15.451
<v Speaker 2>and they really do burn some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice in front of this owl and </v>

1282
01:02:15.451 --> 01:02:18.940
<v Speaker 2>there's a speakers that are at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

1283
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 2>this is a lesser</v>

1284
01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:25.850
<v Speaker 1>documented part of the ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At one point there's a guy in leaf </v>

1285
01:02:25.981 --> 01:02:30.981
<v Speaker 1>covered later hosan appears in like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage cutouts of the redwood tree and </v>

1286
01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>start singing this kind of allergy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

1287
01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1288
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So leaves.</v>

1289
01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.800
<v Speaker 1>So that's how it starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's before the men in robes.</v>

1290
01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Turnip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like some weird pagan nature </v>

1291
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>leach covered later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hose and Joe,</v>

1292
01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.800
<v Speaker 1>how much would you give to be in one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those skull on bonds meetings?</v>

1293
01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:55.810
<v Speaker 1>See if they actually like film each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other's sucking Derek's or something </v>

1294
01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:59.001
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something that goes on where </v>

1295
01:02:59.001 --> 01:02:59.001
<v Speaker 1>they have like something over those </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

1296
01:02:59.001 --> 01:03:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly that's like the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theories.</v>

1297
01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:06.720
<v Speaker 1>That's it makes them engage in gay sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe these things happen for a </v>

1298
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.610
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know it's going to.</v>

1299
01:03:08.611 --> 01:03:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Bones exists for a reason because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have something over you.</v>

1300
01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.790
<v Speaker 1>It could be that or it could be just </v>
<v Speaker 1>this weird sense,</v>

1301
01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:19.850
<v Speaker 1>this weird sort of psychological need </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people like Ivy League people feel </v>

1302
01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:23.391
<v Speaker 1>they need to like have a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>superiority and we're meant to do that </v>

1303
01:03:23.391 --> 01:03:25.380
<v Speaker 1>is to kind of create these secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals to give them a sense of like,</v>

1304
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:30.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grand juror over the people if that's </v>

1305
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:30.500
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1306
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Now a guy like Alex Jones stumbles upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that or infiltrates it </v>

1307
01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:37.251
<v Speaker 1>and find out it is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is just a fine to such a and</v>

1308
01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.480
<v Speaker 1>enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous level.</v>

1309
01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Alex,</v>

1310
01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:45.501
<v Speaker 1>but here's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my truck with Alex and all of this is </v>

1311
01:03:45.501 --> 01:03:48.321
<v Speaker 1>that it wasn't like the Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of their fucking crazy shit that we </v>

1312
01:03:48.321 --> 01:03:53.241
<v Speaker 1>saw that night wasn't enough lucky hat </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like turn it up to 11 of course.</v>

1313
01:03:53.341 --> 01:03:58.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and imply that weird possibly witnessed </v>

1314
01:03:58.341 --> 01:03:58.620
<v Speaker 1>an actual human sacrifice and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that standard,</v>

1315
01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:02.400
<v Speaker 1>that standard Alex Jones one-on-one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it shouldn't be.</v>

1316
01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:05.310
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1317
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:10.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerations exaggerations that take </v>

1318
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:12.300
<v Speaker 1>place in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's on the left or the right.</v>

1319
01:04:12.301 --> 01:04:14.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a ramp and exaggerations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1320
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>it's funny you should say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did you watch Alex being interviewed </v>

1321
01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>by Meghan Kelly?</v>

1322
01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that may be like,</v>

1323
01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:24.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they phoned me a couple of days before </v>

1324
01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:26.661
<v Speaker 1>the broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meghan Kelly's people because they were </v>

1325
01:04:26.661 --> 01:04:27.510
<v Speaker 1>panicking to remember there was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of criticism they were getting for,</v>

1326
01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:32.730
<v Speaker 1>for having a on in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they called me up and they basically </v>

1327
01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:36.891
<v Speaker 1>wanted me to give them as much evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I could prove that Alex and trump </v>

1328
01:04:36.891 --> 01:04:38.880
<v Speaker 1>were aligned and they will talk to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and so on.</v>

1329
01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Called you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1330
01:04:40.021 --> 01:04:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Because you went to Bohemian grow with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1331
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:46.850
<v Speaker 1>I went to go pee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I also put out this little kindle </v>

1332
01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:50.211
<v Speaker 1>single last summer called the elephant </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the room in which I'm trying to </v>

1333
01:04:50.211 --> 01:04:53.720
<v Speaker 1>trace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the relationship between Alex and </v>

1334
01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.440
<v Speaker 1>trump didn't fire up street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of in this interesting stuff.</v>

1335
01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:58.320
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I answered the questions as best as I</v>

1336
01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:01.140
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know that much about exactly</v>

1337
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:03.120
<v Speaker 1>how often trumping alex talk to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

1338
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:08.520
<v Speaker 1>either had it or didn't really that </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in it as odd as it is.</v>

1339
01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a very fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with Alex in,</v>

1340
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000
<v Speaker 1>in that and he's actually my friend and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so when I see him it's like,</v>

1341
01:05:17.711 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>what's up</v>

1342
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.670
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

1343
01:05:18.671 --> 01:05:20.710
<v Speaker 2>I give him a hug and people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1344
01:05:20.711 --> 01:05:23.020
<v Speaker 2>he's a monster or how can you be friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them and this and that.</v>

1345
01:05:23.021 --> 01:05:24.910
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1346
01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:27.970
<v Speaker 2>I just base it on my interactions with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1347
01:05:27.971 --> 01:05:29.320
<v Speaker 2>And what does he say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucked up things.</v>

1348
01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most disturbing thing that I didn't </v>

1349
01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:35.851
<v Speaker 2>even know when he did the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that he was sandy hook </v>

1350
01:05:35.851 --> 01:05:35.851
<v Speaker 2>denier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1351
01:05:35.851 --> 01:05:40.590
<v Speaker 2>So apparently he's backed off that since</v>
<v Speaker 2>being confronted by the facts and,</v>

1352
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:46.980
<v Speaker 2>and there was a horrible article that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>read about a father who was actually a </v>

1353
01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:51.031
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theorist until his son was </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed in Sandy Hook and then he got </v>

1354
01:05:51.031 --> 01:05:55.891
<v Speaker 2>death threats for lying and Zoom Info </v>
<v Speaker 2>wars and that was so just so just so </v>

1355
01:05:57.551 --> 01:05:58.250
<v Speaker 2>sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1356
01:05:58.251 --> 01:06:03.251
<v Speaker 2>That's just so people look for fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracies and everything and I don't </v>

1357
01:06:04.391 --> 01:06:05.560
<v Speaker 2>know what it is.</v>

1358
01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I have friends that have this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand it.</v>

1359
01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Things that could be easily explained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look for a conspiracy and it </v>

1360
01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:16.150
<v Speaker 2>happens in the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be a different story.</v>

1361
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:20.470
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes shit just happens and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when that shit happens,</v>

1362
01:06:20.471 --> 01:06:25.471
<v Speaker 2>the news has a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't always have to be some sort </v>

1363
01:06:25.471 --> 01:06:28.891
<v Speaker 2>of nefarious plot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these people also think that the </v>

1364
01:06:28.891 --> 01:06:29.600
<v Speaker 2>government is filled with idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

1365
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:34.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry you can't have it both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't have a bunch of incompetent </v>

1366
01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:38.371
<v Speaker 2>fuck heads who pull off the perfect fake</v>
<v Speaker 2>world where everything you see is some </v>

1367
01:06:39.611 --> 01:06:44.560
<v Speaker 2>sort of an elaborate played out scheme </v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to manipulate you and d they're</v>

1368
01:06:44.561 --> 01:06:49.561
<v Speaker 2>buying this are voting for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a weird inclination that </v>

1369
01:06:49.561 --> 01:06:54.061
<v Speaker 2>people have to not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just some conspiracy theories but </v>

1370
01:06:54.061 --> 01:06:57.730
<v Speaker 2>almost everything to think everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some part of some crazy plot.</v>

1371
01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:02.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you said about biases and untruths,</v>

1372
01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:07.920
<v Speaker 2>like across the media on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm reminded to be if the Meghan Kelly </v>

1373
01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:11.940
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they phoned me up obviously in a bit </v>

1374
01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:15.421
<v Speaker 2>of a panic because they would get </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting so much criticism and then they </v>

1375
01:07:15.421 --> 01:07:16.770
<v Speaker 2>react to the show like frantically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just before,</v>

1376
01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:19.180
<v Speaker 2>wherever he edited it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did they change?</v>

1377
01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1378
01:07:20.021 --> 01:07:25.021
<v Speaker 2>but what I do know is like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the final product and the final </v>

1379
01:07:25.021 --> 01:07:28.450
<v Speaker 2>product was basically Meghan Kelly </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking incredibly poised,</v>

1380
01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:32.110
<v Speaker 2>saying you'll rung Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll run about this,</v>

1381
01:07:32.111 --> 01:07:33.200
<v Speaker 2>and then it would cut out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good,</v>

1382
01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:37.180
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't recover to Meghan so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh they did.</v>

1383
01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Was Alex that is most sweaty stuttery </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then Meghan Kelly at her most poised</v>

1384
01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:45.250
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

1385
01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:47.380
<v Speaker 2>What did you see or hear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Alex Jones,</v>

1386
01:07:47.381 --> 01:07:48.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>audio,</v>

1387
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:49.780
<v Speaker 2>the leaked audio that he released?</v>

1388
01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were they were sort of buttering him up </v>

1389
01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:54.780
<v Speaker 2>and conning him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1390
01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.360
<v Speaker 2>he was saying personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was saying I don't,</v>

1391
01:07:57.361 --> 01:08:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not here to make a hit piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to know the real you.</v>

1392
01:08:00.131 --> 01:08:02.880
<v Speaker 2>And almost although they did get it so </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1393
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:08.190
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do what the original program </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have been like because they felt </v>

1394
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:09.940
<v Speaker 2>forced to buy him yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1395
01:08:09.941 --> 01:08:13.450
<v Speaker 2>they felt forced by like the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing back against them doing it.</v>

1396
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Him A to then put out this Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1397
01:08:17.781 --> 01:08:22.781
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically it was in Meghan Kelly's </v>

1398
01:08:22.781 --> 01:08:22.781
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have told her,</v>

1399
01:08:22.781 --> 01:08:24.230
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't ever go to NBC.</v>

1400
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the deal like you,</v>

1401
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:30.970
<v Speaker 2>you made your bones as an ice princess </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this conservative network and do you </v>

1402
01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:33.590
<v Speaker 2>think they're just going to accept you </v>
<v Speaker 2>at NBC?</v>

1403
01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.170
<v Speaker 2>People are going to resent you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to hate you.</v>

1404
01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Like you're the lady that chastise </v>
<v Speaker 2>people for saying that Santa Claus </v>

1405
01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:42.560
<v Speaker 2>potentially wasn't white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

1406
01:08:42.561 --> 01:08:44.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1407
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:45.860
<v Speaker 2>It was some thing where they were saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1408
01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:50.980
<v Speaker 2>there was people talking about Santa </v>
<v Speaker 2>Claus being black and I'll never forget </v>

1409
01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.720
<v Speaker 2>it because she was on tv going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Santa Claus is white.</v>

1410
01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Like then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck the fuck are you talking </v>

1411
01:08:58.980 --> 01:08:59.040
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa Claus isn't real.</v>

1412
01:08:59.041 --> 01:09:04.041
<v Speaker 2>You crazy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say Santa Claus is white more </v>

1413
01:09:04.041 --> 01:09:05.810
<v Speaker 2>than you could say cat in the hat is </v>
<v Speaker 2>red.</v>

1414
01:09:05.811 --> 01:09:09.770
<v Speaker 2>They're not real things know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can decide that.</v>

1415
01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:12.860
<v Speaker 2>You know like the cat in the hat in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book is always white.</v>

1416
01:09:12.861 --> 01:09:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1417
01:09:13.491 --> 01:09:14.460
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>

1418
01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:16.970
<v Speaker 2>But it is he black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>

1419
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:20.030
<v Speaker 2>What does the cat in the hat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a hat is red and white.</v>

1420
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:23.630
<v Speaker 2>What color is he though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's black.</v>

1421
01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Izzy?</v>

1422
01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1423
01:09:26.811 --> 01:09:31.811
<v Speaker 2>It's not important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's important is that like her </v>

1424
01:09:31.811 --> 01:09:35.021
<v Speaker 2>whole thing was being a spokesperson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This ultra hot spokesperson for the </v>

1425
01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:41.051
<v Speaker 2>conservative movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also being someone who's ruthlessly </v>

1426
01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:43.721
<v Speaker 2>smart and articulate and capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shutting down these stammering liberals </v>

1427
01:09:43.821 --> 01:09:47.420
<v Speaker 2>that day or go and question her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her narrative.</v>

1428
01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden she's on NBC like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

1429
01:09:50.181 --> 01:09:52.580
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're not going to accept you.</v>

1430
01:09:52.581 --> 01:09:57.581
<v Speaker 2>This is not going to work in the ratings</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been horrendous and now she's free </v>

1431
01:09:57.581 --> 01:09:58.580
<v Speaker 2>and now they pulled the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It pulled the show early,</v>

1432
01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.460
<v Speaker 2>but it just goes to show like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1433
01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:05.520
<v Speaker 2>we rightly attack people like Info laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>for spreading,</v>

1434
01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outright lies.</v>

1435
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we on the left like Megan Kelly </v>

1436
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:15.570
<v Speaker 2>editing that segment to make it look </v>
<v Speaker 2>like she was poised and perfect at all.</v>

1437
01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Alex does this dominant sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's very hard,</v>

1438
01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:20.510
<v Speaker 2>very hard sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saying that Megan Kelly is on the left,</v>

1439
01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:23.390
<v Speaker 2>which is on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what I mean like the mainstream,</v>

1440
01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:27.440
<v Speaker 2>the main that NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the mainstream has its own tricks.</v>

1441
01:10:27.441 --> 01:10:31.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an outright lie like Alex would</v>

1442
01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:33.290
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

1443
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:34.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pataky,</v>

1444
01:10:34.821 --> 01:10:36.870
<v Speaker 2>selective editing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's its own.</v>

1445
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:39.820
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have imagined that that Julian,</v>

1446
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:41.930
<v Speaker 2>the interview between Alex and Megan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kelly,</v>

1447
01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Alex would have said some things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

1448
01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:46.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eloquent or,</v>

1449
01:10:46.491 --> 01:10:49.370
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or sentence without a sweat.</v>

1450
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:54.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure its own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well here's also the problem and having </v>

1451
01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:59.410
<v Speaker 2>any sort of a conversation about any </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of difficult subject and stuffing </v>

1452
01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:02.000
<v Speaker 2>it into seven minutes or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

1453
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an ancient way of communicating and</v>

1454
01:11:04.731 --> 01:11:08.330
<v Speaker 2>now that we have the Internet and Alex </v>
<v Speaker 2>is shown with his own show,</v>

1455
01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:13.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he can go and rant about something </v>

1456
01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:13.360
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 15 minutes,</v>

1457
01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:18.080
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an with no limitations or </v>

1458
01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:18.080
<v Speaker 2>restrictions like that.</v>

1459
01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:18.510
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a better way to communicate.</v>

1460
01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:23.660
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do when I had alex on the podcast is I </v>

1461
01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:26.880
<v Speaker 2>wanted people to see the Alex that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know because there's no other way to see</v>

1462
01:11:26.881 --> 01:11:28.620
<v Speaker 2>him like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to get him drunk.</v>

1463
01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to get them high and I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have him talk.</v>

1464
01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.360
<v Speaker 2>And my friend Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's so in a conspiracy,</v>

1465
01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:39.380
<v Speaker 2>he kind of fucked some of it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just so into chem trails and </v>

1466
01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:43.491
<v Speaker 2>proving the chem trails are real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was good overall because it's </v>

1467
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:48.830
<v Speaker 2>like he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex is so crazy that even eddie was </v>

1468
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:51.831
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does a couple of moments where </v>

1469
01:11:51.831 --> 01:11:51.831
<v Speaker 2>Eddie turned to look at Alex?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1470
01:11:51.831 --> 01:11:56.001
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what he's talking about </v>

1471
01:11:56.001 --> 01:11:56.001
<v Speaker 2>interdimensional child molesters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's.</v>

1472
01:11:56.001 --> 01:11:58.740
<v Speaker 2>I wanted people to see him the way I see</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1473
01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:01.200
<v Speaker 2>He's a fun guy that I like hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1474
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Do I think that he has a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence?</v>

1475
01:12:03.511 --> 01:12:08.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I think he says things that he </v>

1476
01:12:08.511 --> 01:12:08.511
<v Speaker 2>definitely shouldn't say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

1477
01:12:08.511 --> 01:12:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Especially the sandy hook stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1478
01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:14.570
<v Speaker 2>I think this inclination to always look </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards conspiracy is dangerous.</v>

1479
01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.170
<v Speaker 2>It's harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1480
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1481
01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:19.530
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1482
01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:23.250
<v Speaker 2>it's dangerous in that people are easily</v>
<v Speaker 2>led.</v>

1483
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:26.100
<v Speaker 2>And if you get people thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's a conspiracy,</v>

1484
01:12:26.101 --> 01:12:31.101
<v Speaker 2>the real problem is they don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck a conspiracy actually is when </v>

1485
01:12:31.101 --> 01:12:32.400
<v Speaker 2>it's in front of them and it's real and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a ton of them that are real.</v>

1486
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:37.700
<v Speaker 2>So when you call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're crying wolf around every corner </v>

1487
01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:37.700
<v Speaker 2>and then all of a sudden you turn a </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner like,</v>

1488
01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:38.460
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real wolf.</v>

1489
01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:43.700
<v Speaker 2>No one is listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I agree that that's my frustration </v>

1490
01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:47.721
<v Speaker 2>with Alex too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that he has a conspiracy template on </v>

1491
01:12:47.721 --> 01:12:47.721
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1492
01:12:47.721 --> 01:12:51.590
<v Speaker 2>For real world event happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had shoe horns into this kind of </v>

1493
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:52.490
<v Speaker 2>simplistic template.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1494
01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:55.680
<v Speaker 2>he's got some crazy ideas about Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's bay or no,</v>

1495
01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:01.120
<v Speaker 2>was it the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's bases on the moon that they're </v>

1496
01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.820
<v Speaker 2>going to all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what he's saying?</v>

1497
01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:06.630
<v Speaker 2>He's got some crazy moon thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he thinks that they.</v>

1498
01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Well they went on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is what they found up there,</v>

1499
01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:14.170
<v Speaker 2>like he's got the goat spied to hybrid </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he talks about is true though he </v>

1500
01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:19.431
<v Speaker 2>doesn't express it very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I learnt in this measurement and </v>

1501
01:13:19.431 --> 01:13:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Monistat soda those years ago that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>really would like,</v>

1502
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:25.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really were a mixing up spy to silk</v>

1503
01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:27.780
<v Speaker 2>with goat milk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

1504
01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Some kind of Alex Jones reveals the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth about animal human hybrids and the</v>

1505
01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:33.120
<v Speaker 2>moon landing.</v>

1506
01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.720
<v Speaker 2>The real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give us some.</v>

1507
01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Give us some volume here because Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1508
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.100
<v Speaker 2>bleeding from your face left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1509
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're scared.</v>

1510
01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:47.481
<v Speaker 2>You're so mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Kathy Griffin simulating </v>

1511
01:13:47.481 --> 01:13:49.110
<v Speaker 2>murdering trump when trump says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ought to be ashamed of yourself.</v>

1512
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:50.550
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare you,</v>

1513
01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:52.620
<v Speaker 2>you broke me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talked me.</v>

1514
01:13:52.621 --> 01:13:55.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm a victim of pause right then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>run.</v>

1515
01:13:56.010 --> 01:13:59.510
<v Speaker 2>I agree with him 100 percent on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like that was so preposterous and</v>

1516
01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:03.480
<v Speaker 2>I like Kathy as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've met her a 100 times.</v>

1517
01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Kathy Griffin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's always sweet,</v>

1518
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:11.530
<v Speaker 2>but when she was saying that he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bully and he broke me and I was like,</v>

1519
01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.770
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1520
01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:17.860
<v Speaker 2>She held up a photo of his headless body</v>
<v Speaker 2>that his children could have seen or it </v>

1521
01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:23.800
<v Speaker 2>is not as headless body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His head separated from his body that </v>

1522
01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:23.800
<v Speaker 2>his children could have seen.</v>

1523
01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that like,</v>

1524
01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:25.570
<v Speaker 2>what is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1525
01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:28.900
<v Speaker 2>that's it's so effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't.</v>

1526
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:31.750
<v Speaker 2>And then for her to say that he broke </v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

1527
01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.660
<v Speaker 2>he's a bully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all he did was say it was horrible.</v>

1528
01:14:34.710 --> 01:14:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that he's targeting her.</v>

1529
01:14:37.271 --> 01:14:42.271
<v Speaker 2>It's like this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like professional victim thing that </v>

1530
01:14:42.271 --> 01:14:44.230
<v Speaker 2>people enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they enjoy,</v>

1531
01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.910
<v Speaker 2>like taking on the role with such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have such energy.</v>

1532
01:14:48.911 --> 01:14:52.330
<v Speaker 2>They put two being the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just God,</v>

1533
01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:55.030
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't hold up pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's heads.</v>

1534
01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't like them.</v>

1535
01:14:56.950 --> 01:15:00.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially like in this day and age when</v>

1536
01:15:00.041 --> 01:15:05.020
<v Speaker 2>there's people that actually cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's heads off and been show them on</v>

1537
01:15:05.021 --> 01:15:06.970
<v Speaker 2>camera and me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking crazy.</v>

1538
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1539
01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:09.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1540
01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.990
<v Speaker 2>speaking of cutting people's heads off </v>
<v Speaker 2>and show them on camera,</v>

1541
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:18.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the time that I was hanging out </v>

1542
01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:21.541
<v Speaker 2>with Alex at payment grove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hanging out documenting this </v>

1543
01:15:21.541 --> 01:15:24.631
<v Speaker 2>Islamic militant Chordoma Mohammed who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the head of this group in Britain.</v>

1544
01:15:24.791 --> 01:15:29.791
<v Speaker 2>Go download hydroone and a bunch of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are the ones who like now drive </v>

1545
01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:36.640
<v Speaker 2>fans into pedestrians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd a mixed all of the people with the </v>

1546
01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:42.630
<v Speaker 2>craziest and most pernicious idea is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I hung out with in the days rose to</v>

1547
01:15:43.061 --> 01:15:47.790
<v Speaker 2>the top and I'm influenced their worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So including.</v>

1548
01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1549
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:49.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex,</v>

1550
01:15:49.661 --> 01:15:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Alex just have political </v>
<v Speaker 2>sway.</v>

1551
01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he's right about these animal </v>

1552
01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:56.880
<v Speaker 2>human hybrid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's go back to that place.</v>

1553
01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:57.460
<v Speaker 2>We need to find out what's happening on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moon.</v>

1554
01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Did you turn off of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go back to it.</v>

1555
01:16:02.361 --> 01:16:02.920
<v Speaker 2>What'd you do?</v>

1556
01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:08.880
<v Speaker 5>I think around violence done so many </v>
<v Speaker 5>death reporters.</v>

1557
01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.670
<v Speaker 5>She broke me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Looks like the day of the dead on CNN,</v>

1558
01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:22.120
<v Speaker 5>just like Kathy Griffin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess that's the look that sucker's </v>

1559
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.590
<v Speaker 5>looking for and then they freak out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>go.</v>

1560
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:28.950
<v Speaker 5>You called me irresponsible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You said that I was a bad person.</v>

1561
01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:33.820
<v Speaker 5>I've been crushed by you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a bully.</v>

1562
01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:40.500
<v Speaker 5>It's a bunch of corporate special </v>
<v Speaker 5>interests that had their foot or their </v>

1563
01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:44.500
<v Speaker 5>knee on our neck and now they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One hundred percent got us on the ground</v>

1564
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:47.920
<v Speaker 5>and they're just flipping out a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>

1565
01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:48.950
<v Speaker 5>How the fuck fuck</v>

1566
01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:53.970
<v Speaker 2>did he go from Kathy Griffin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a comedian who did a gag that she </v>

1567
01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:55.090
<v Speaker 2>taught was going to get her attention to</v>
<v Speaker 2>backfire too.</v>

1568
01:16:55.340 --> 01:17:00.340
<v Speaker 2>There are a bunch of corporate special </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests who've had their knee on our </v>

1569
01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:00.340
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

1570
01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:05.670
<v Speaker 2>So how the fuck is Kathy Griffin and got</v>
<v Speaker 2>her knee and anybody's neck like she's </v>

1571
01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:07.040
<v Speaker 2>not a corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not special interest.</v>

1572
01:17:07.041 --> 01:17:09.040
<v Speaker 2>She's a fucking comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know her.</v>

1573
01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:14.230
<v Speaker 2>You can that conspiracy instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You looking for the part where it talks </v>

1574
01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:18.971
<v Speaker 2>about the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look ahead and see what this human </v>

1575
01:17:18.971 --> 01:17:22.121
<v Speaker 2>animal hybrid thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you that he has too much </v>

1576
01:17:22.121 --> 01:17:26.291
<v Speaker 2>influence over some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I disagree in that.</v>

1577
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:31.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think any of that should be </v>

1578
01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:31.810
<v Speaker 2>taken seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

1579
01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:33.140
<v Speaker 2>what he just said should not be taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

1580
01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:38.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of this would matter if there </v>

1581
01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:39.440
<v Speaker 1>wasn't just the possibility that trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>believes this stuff.</v>

1582
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Although I'll tell you what I would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>last summer I was,</v>

1583
01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:43.700
<v Speaker 1>when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got this book,</v>

1584
01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:45.740
<v Speaker 1>the elephant in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to trace that,</v>

1585
01:17:45.741 --> 01:17:47.330
<v Speaker 1>just how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex,</v>

1586
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:48.320
<v Speaker 1>buyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger Stone,</v>

1587
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:50.030
<v Speaker 1>meeting trump and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>

1588
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I discovered one really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing which is this is something that </v>

1589
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:57.821
<v Speaker 1>Alex didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex did say to me when I was writing </v>

1590
01:17:57.821 --> 01:17:57.821
<v Speaker 1>this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could write whatever you want.</v>

1591
01:17:57.821 --> 01:17:58.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1592
01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:00.590
<v Speaker 1>but that turned out to not be entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

1593
01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:02.600
<v Speaker 1>There were things that you did care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that I wrote.</v>

1594
01:18:02.670 --> 01:18:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them was a talked to Glenn Beck </v>

1595
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:11.360
<v Speaker 1>and he told me to start this before </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump was elected.</v>

1596
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:16.660
<v Speaker 1>He told me this story about how trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>invited him to Mara Largo around the </v>

1597
01:18:16.821 --> 01:18:18.890
<v Speaker 1>time that trump was deciding to stand.</v>

1598
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:23.500
<v Speaker 1>And he phoned Glenn Beck even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were both at Mara Lago.</v>

1599
01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump was in run one room and Glenn Beck</v>

1600
01:18:26.871 --> 01:18:28.940
<v Speaker 1>was in the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump found Glenn Beck and said,</v>

1601
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:31.450
<v Speaker 1>I think you have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1603
01:18:33.681 --> 01:18:34.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're great.</v>

1604
01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.360
<v Speaker 1>You've got such influential can you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>unite the tea party.</v>

1605
01:18:38.361 --> 01:18:40.520
<v Speaker 1>And the mainstream Republicans in Glenn </v>
<v Speaker 1>Beck thought,</v>

1606
01:18:40.521 --> 01:18:41.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

1607
01:18:41.811 --> 01:18:43.130
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1608
01:18:43.131 --> 01:18:44.570
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're playing me.</v>

1609
01:18:44.571 --> 01:18:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I've been down this road a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

1610
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:48.950
<v Speaker 1>And then trump did the same thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex.</v>

1611
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:51.050
<v Speaker 1>he phoned Alex and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1612
01:18:51.051 --> 01:18:53.090
<v Speaker 1>you have so much influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1613
01:18:53.091 --> 01:18:58.091
<v Speaker 1>you're so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Alex bought it because according to </v>

1614
01:18:58.091 --> 01:18:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Glenn Beck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1615
01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.890
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spoke to both of them.</v>

1616
01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't speak to trump.</v>

1617
01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I didn't speak to trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both Glenn Beck and Alex and I don't </v>

1618
01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:10.400
<v Speaker 1>know that Glen Book really did get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone call from trump,</v>

1619
01:19:10.401 --> 01:19:15.401
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it was Glenn Beck told me that </v>

1620
01:19:15.401 --> 01:19:15.401
<v Speaker 1>either</v>

1621
01:19:15.401 --> 01:19:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Glenn Beck has said some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous shit himself.</v>

1622
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:23.890
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only became a mormon at the age of 51.</v>

1623
01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:29.820
<v Speaker 2>I only say I only ever read the book so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1624
01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.270
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that's convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if it's right is convenient.</v>

1625
01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.710
<v Speaker 2>It makes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes it look interesting.</v>

1626
01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1627
01:19:37.491 --> 01:19:40.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what Glen Beck told me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need a word for that store.</v>

1628
01:19:40.570 --> 01:19:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really know what I mean.</v>

1629
01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:48.780
<v Speaker 2>I come back to me that I believe that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump called up Alex and said you</v>

1630
01:19:49.041 --> 01:19:52.310
<v Speaker 2>were so influential and you're amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Alice will thank you,</v>

1631
01:19:52.311 --> 01:19:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>President,</v>

1632
01:19:52.881 --> 01:19:54.350
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna do our best to keep you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

1633
01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Fight against the tyranny and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking people out there that think </v>

1634
01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.440
<v Speaker 2>they're going to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1635
01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:03.030
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1636
01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:04.730
<v Speaker 2>that's who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1637
01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.470
<v Speaker 2>you can get them riled up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's who he is.</v>

1638
01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:11.500
<v Speaker 2>But I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that Alex has a kind of bit </v>

1639
01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:14.031
<v Speaker 2>of a neophyte in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all of this because nobody had taken </v>

1640
01:20:14.031 --> 01:20:16.671
<v Speaker 2>him that seriously before that nobody in</v>
<v Speaker 2>positions of power are taking them that </v>

1641
01:20:16.671 --> 01:20:17.010
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the deal.</v>

1642
01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:22.740
<v Speaker 2>I think trump played alex and Alex was </v>
<v Speaker 2>played.</v>

1643
01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:25.050
<v Speaker 2>You might be right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>

1644
01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:27.810
<v Speaker 2>if trump turned on Alex and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1645
01:20:27.811 --> 01:20:28.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1646
01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:30.310
<v Speaker 2>for awards is a bunch of losers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of this.</v>

1647
01:20:30.311 --> 01:20:35.311
<v Speaker 2>Now Alex would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would turn it around again and he </v>

1648
01:20:36.241 --> 01:20:38.750
<v Speaker 2>would go after trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

1649
01:20:38.751 --> 01:20:39.550
<v Speaker 2>he would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1650
01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Alex is really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Alex from the beginning set like </v>

1651
01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:47.851
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with trump until trump says </v>

1652
01:20:47.851 --> 01:20:47.851
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1653
01:20:47.851 --> 01:20:48.390
<v Speaker 2>that I don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'll drop them like a hot potato.</v>

1654
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.760
<v Speaker 2>So Alex was very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Alex always gave him.</v>

1655
01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:53.850
<v Speaker 2>He gave himself a sort of parachute and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this relationship.</v>

1656
01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:58.850
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think trump played alex and Alex </v>

1657
01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:00.690
<v Speaker 2>was a bit too gullible and believed </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's slick talk.</v>

1658
01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:04.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Alex was also smart and gave himself</v>

1659
01:21:04.471 --> 01:21:07.740
<v Speaker 2>and out whenever he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The out Alex's goddamned entertaining,</v>

1660
01:21:07.741 --> 01:21:11.580
<v Speaker 2>like that alone is fucking entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for me a person.</v>

1661
01:21:11.581 --> 01:21:14.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be influenced by these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that he says,</v>

1662
01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:19.760
<v Speaker 2>but one thing that I have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced his bite him uncovering some </v>

1663
01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:23.980
<v Speaker 2>things that are real conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them being agent provocateurs and</v>

1664
01:21:23.981 --> 01:21:26.290
<v Speaker 2>they use to disrupt peaceful protests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1665
01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:28.050
<v Speaker 2>this was something that I didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>

1666
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:33.030
<v Speaker 2>was a standard tactic by the military </v>
<v Speaker 2>and by certain politicians.</v>

1667
01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:36.240
<v Speaker 2>And what they do is they will hire these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1668
01:21:36.241 --> 01:21:38.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what branch of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>

1669
01:21:38.161 --> 01:21:41.250
<v Speaker 2>what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they will hire these people and it's</v>

1670
01:21:41.251 --> 01:21:45.300
<v Speaker 2>been confirmed by people that I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are like special operators.</v>

1671
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:51.210
<v Speaker 2>They take these masked guys and say if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have some peaceful protest,</v>

1672
01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:53.940
<v Speaker 2>the big one was the World Trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>Organization.</v>

1673
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:59.060
<v Speaker 2>You remember that protest and these guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>with masks and government issued boots </v>

1674
01:21:59.221 --> 01:22:01.800
<v Speaker 2>came in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started smashing windows,</v>

1675
01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:07.130
<v Speaker 2>lighting things on fire and that gave </v>
<v Speaker 2>them an excuse to come in and break up </v>

1676
01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:11.691
<v Speaker 2>this riot where it had been a peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 2>protest where they couldn't stop the </v>

1677
01:22:11.691 --> 01:22:16.191
<v Speaker 2>peaceful protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now they break up these riots that </v>

1678
01:22:16.191 --> 01:22:18.240
<v Speaker 2>they've created themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start arresting people left and right.</v>

1679
01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Then they put up a no protest zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all documented.</v>

1680
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:29.350
<v Speaker 2>Did you just do some dance music music </v>
<v Speaker 2>on and apparently.</v>

1681
01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:36.360
<v Speaker 2>But see this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he documented a.</v>

1682
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:40.340
<v Speaker 2>He documented this and has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>documented by many people since then and</v>

1683
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:45.380
<v Speaker 2>and even in legitimate circles like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a big factor in the occupy Wall </v>

1684
01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Street movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The occupy Wall Street movement was </v>

1685
01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.291
<v Speaker 2>infiltrated Ad Nauseum by people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever branch of government,</v>

1686
01:22:55.330 --> 01:22:56.550
<v Speaker 2>whoever the fuck they were.</v>

1687
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:58.710
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they did was they,</v>

1688
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:03.480
<v Speaker 2>they cause chaos and then it gives me an</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse to arrest them.</v>

1689
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.800
<v Speaker 2>And then in the World Trade Organization</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1690
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Alex detailed like with news reports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independent news reports,</v>

1691
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.210
<v Speaker 2>how those people were not arrested and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were all negotiated,</v>

1692
01:23:13.211 --> 01:23:18.211
<v Speaker 2>negotiated their freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all held up in a house somewhere </v>

1693
01:23:18.211 --> 01:23:22.111
<v Speaker 2>and then they got them out of there as </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as everybody kind of forgot about </v>

1694
01:23:22.111 --> 01:23:25.561
<v Speaker 2>it all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they set up a no protest zone </v>

1695
01:23:25.561 --> 01:23:28.100
<v Speaker 2>and the no protests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Owen was fascinating because there's a </v>

1696
01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:29.410
<v Speaker 2>lot of people that disagreed with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies of the World Trade Organization</v>

1697
01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:34.710
<v Speaker 2>and these people were going to work with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pin on a backpack or a jacket that </v>

1698
01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:36.160
<v Speaker 2>said dubby too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and had a line through it.</v>

1699
01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:41.020
<v Speaker 2>The police told them they could not go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through with the pin on.</v>

1700
01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:46.170
<v Speaker 2>They could not go to work with a pin on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had a line through the word WTO,</v>

1701
01:23:46.291 --> 01:23:47.560
<v Speaker 2>like they opposed the WTO.</v>

1702
01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:49.840
<v Speaker 2>This is a no protest zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1703
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:54.990
<v Speaker 2>That's Alex Jones showed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as Wacky as he might be about alien </v>

1704
01:23:55.211 --> 01:24:00.211
<v Speaker 2>babies are coming from another dimension</v>
<v Speaker 2>that here to steal your soul and make </v>

1705

1706
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:03.130

<v Speaker 2>he might be wrong about a lot of shit,</v>

1707
01:24:03.131 --> 01:24:08.131
<v Speaker 2>but he also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got the balls to expose a lot of </v>

1708
01:24:08.131 --> 01:24:09.670
<v Speaker 2>crazy shit that people didn't talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1709
01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It reminds me of the time I went to </v>

1710
01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Arian nations just before it closed </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1718
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

1719
01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:33.600
<v Speaker 2>So I was making a documentary about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Randy Weaver about ruby rich spending</v>

1720
01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.930
<v Speaker 1>lots of time with Randy's daughter </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rachel,</v>

1721
01:24:36.931 --> 01:24:38.210
<v Speaker 1>who I liked a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1722
01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:43.910
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason why the whole ruby </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich escalation happened was because </v>

1723
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:45.210
<v Speaker 1>randy wavered come to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't know that story,</v>

1724
01:24:45.230 --> 01:24:46.390
<v Speaker 1>but I tell the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1725
01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:50.610
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a family of white separatists,</v>

1726
01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:54.030
<v Speaker 1>a rotten day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and becky and their children,</v>

1727
01:24:54.031 --> 01:24:59.031
<v Speaker 1>Sarah and Rachel and a boy whose name </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've forgotten people will be.</v>

1728
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:06.510
<v Speaker 1>It'll come to me anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they moved to Idaho early,</v>

1729
01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:08.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early conspiracy theorists.</v>

1730
01:25:08.341 --> 01:25:09.420
<v Speaker 1>They moved to Idaho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a,</v>

1731
01:25:09.810 --> 01:25:13.380
<v Speaker 1>to a cabin on top of a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place called Ruby Creek.</v>

1732
01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randy and Vicky used to go to area </v>

1733
01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:19.950
<v Speaker 1>nations for like their picnics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>barbecues,</v>

1734
01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:23.150
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a kind of pivotal points.</v>

1735
01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.940
<v Speaker 1>They weren't as crazy as the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are heavy,</v>

1736
01:25:25.941 --> 01:25:28.860
<v Speaker 1>heavier nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't white supremacists,</v>

1737
01:25:28.861 --> 01:25:31.590
<v Speaker 1>but they were sort of fellow travelers </v>
<v Speaker 1>but not quite as crazy.</v>

1738
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:36.950
<v Speaker 1>So any nations was infiltrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of white supremacist groups by lots</v>

1739
01:25:37.771 --> 01:25:41.220
<v Speaker 1>of federal agents and they saw randy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought they could work with them.</v>

1740
01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.710
<v Speaker 1>So they said to around a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1741
01:25:43.711 --> 01:25:46.380
<v Speaker 1>will it be an informant for us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Randy said,</v>

1742
01:25:46.381 --> 01:25:51.381
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they sent in this guy and asked </v>

1743
01:25:51.381 --> 01:25:54.561
<v Speaker 1>randy to soar off a shotgun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quarter of an inch below the legal </v>

1744
01:25:54.561 --> 01:25:55.380
<v Speaker 1>limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1745
01:25:55.710 --> 01:25:58.860
<v Speaker 1>so randy sort of the shotgun for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1746
01:25:59.310 --> 01:26:01.980
<v Speaker 1>And then they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're federal agents.</v>

1747
01:26:02.010 --> 01:26:07.010
<v Speaker 1>You just committed a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go to prison in less </v>

1748
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:11.451
<v Speaker 1>shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become an informant for us against area </v>

1749
01:26:11.451 --> 01:26:13.691
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Randy being a kind of hot headed </v>

1750
01:26:13.691 --> 01:26:14.660
<v Speaker 1>idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1751
01:26:14.661 --> 01:26:15.800
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

1752
01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:18.230
<v Speaker 1>I made a big show of saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

1753
01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:23.500
<v Speaker 1>So they went back to their cabins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went back to the cabin and a </v>

1754
01:26:23.691 --> 01:26:27.860
<v Speaker 1>warrant was issued for Randy's arrest </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rented and turn up to court.</v>

1755
01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:31.700
<v Speaker 1>So now the US marshals are like hiding </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the bushes,</v>

1756
01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:34.340
<v Speaker 1>looking at randy's cabin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randy arms,</v>

1757
01:26:34.341 --> 01:26:36.200
<v Speaker 1>his kids in his tiny little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1758
01:26:36.201 --> 01:26:39.110
<v Speaker 1>So they're patrolling up and down </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the cabin with these guns.</v>

1759
01:26:40.810 --> 01:26:45.810
<v Speaker 1>They were becoming increasingly paranoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking they were being watched from </v>

1760
01:26:45.810 --> 01:26:48.230
<v Speaker 1>the bushes and they were being watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the bushes,</v>

1761
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.650
<v Speaker 1>CCTV cameras in us marshals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1762
01:26:51.651 --> 01:26:56.651
<v Speaker 1>one day the US marshals got too close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cabin and one of Randy's dogs </v>

1763
01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:03.080
<v Speaker 1>started barking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the kid,</v>

1764
01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Randy's son came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twelve year old kid.</v>

1765
01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm look much younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look like eight years old came out with </v>

1766
01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:14.591
<v Speaker 1>a gun and I'm gunfire happens that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>US marshals shopped the little boy,</v>

1767
01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:23.860
<v Speaker 1>nearly shot his arm off and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he turned around and tried to run back </v>

1768
01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:27.410
<v Speaker 1>to the cabin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm shouting dad and the US Marshall's,</v>

1769
01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:32.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot him in the back and killed him and </v>

1770
01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:34.040
<v Speaker 1>they killed the dog and one US Marshall </v>
<v Speaker 1>was killed.</v>

1771
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:39.430
<v Speaker 1>And there's debate as to whether it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>either the randy son or family friend or</v>

1772
01:27:41.871 --> 01:27:44.300
<v Speaker 1>whether it was friendly fire or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1773
01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:48.850
<v Speaker 1>so they got the son's body and put them </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

1774
01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:54.260
<v Speaker 1>in the cabin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next day this FBI sharp shooter </v>

1775
01:27:54.351 --> 01:27:59.351
<v Speaker 1>called alone Horror Yuchi turned up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the FBI surrounded the cabin.</v>

1776
01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.090
<v Speaker 1>US Marshal had been killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1777
01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:05.330
<v Speaker 1>there were tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were hundreds of troops,</v>

1778
01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:10.720
<v Speaker 1>this was like in the Clinton nineties </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Cold War was kind of dying and </v>

1779
01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.960
<v Speaker 1>they needed a new enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the new enemy that week was Randy</v>

1780
01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Weaver and his family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Vicky Weaver with holding their baby </v>

1781
01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Alicia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the doorway of the cabin,</v>

1782
01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:27.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sharp shooter shot Vicky to the </v>

1783
01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:32.441
<v Speaker 1>face and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pulled Vicky's body into the cabin </v>

1784
01:28:32.441 --> 01:28:33.930
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>

1785
01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:39.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randy was shot as well but survived </v>

1786
01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:42.670
<v Speaker 1>under siege and she would have lasted </v>
<v Speaker 1>about two weeks of the kids inside the </v>

1787
01:28:42.951 --> 01:28:47.720
<v Speaker 1>cabin and the FBI outside of the cabin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ended up ending peacefully.</v>

1788
01:28:48.450 --> 01:28:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Boger rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a bit kind of militia hero to </v>

1789
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:55.791
<v Speaker 1>end up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of helped to stop it from </v>

1790
01:28:55.791 --> 01:28:55.791
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1791
01:28:55.791 --> 01:28:55.791
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1792
01:28:55.791 --> 01:28:57.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helped get randy out of the cabin.</v>

1793
01:28:57.870 --> 01:28:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the end,</v>

1794
01:28:59.151 --> 01:29:03.700
<v Speaker 1>the daughters each got a million dollars</v>
<v Speaker 1>each compensation and um,</v>

1795
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:08.990
<v Speaker 1>and it all kind of faded away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was making a documentary about all </v>

1796
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:08.990
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1797
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:13.130
<v Speaker 1>and I went to area nations because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I can just turn up and say I'm </v>

1798
01:29:13.130 --> 01:29:14.280
<v Speaker 1>friends with Andy Weaver and they'd let </v>
<v Speaker 1>me in.</v>

1799
01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:19.580
<v Speaker 1>So I turned up and immediately ordered </v>
<v Speaker 1>these skinheads surrounded me and </v>

1800
01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:24.231
<v Speaker 1>started asking me what my genealogy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they thought correctly the Euro </v>

1801
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Ju Ju.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I set a,</v>

1802
01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:30.960
<v Speaker 1>what's my genealogy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1803
01:29:30.961 --> 01:29:33.090
<v Speaker 1>that was the word they use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your genealogy?</v>

1804
01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:34.900
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1805
01:29:35.130 --> 01:29:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Church of England.</v>

1806
01:29:37.170 --> 01:29:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the Nazis.</v>

1807
01:29:40.321 --> 01:29:44.070
<v Speaker 1>The area nations made a joke and said </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

1808
01:29:44.071 --> 01:29:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Church of England,</v>

1809
01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:46.740
<v Speaker 1>you're the guys who blog our beds.</v>

1810
01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Some kind of joke and the skinheads sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of drifted away from me and I'm,</v>

1811
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought that the guy who </v>

1812
01:29:56.990 --> 01:30:00.470
<v Speaker 1>alleviated the situation was maybe an </v>
<v Speaker 1>undercover agent who was like calming </v>

1813
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:02.370
<v Speaker 1>things down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so protecting me.</v>

1814
01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:06.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's crossed my knowing how </v>
<v Speaker 1>infiltrated those groups always are.</v>

1815
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Just like the video that you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing how infiltrated these groups </v>

1816
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.390
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they know how infiltrated their,</v>

1817
01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:13.000
<v Speaker 1>they must do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1818
01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.210
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1819
01:30:15.570 --> 01:30:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I know they must do a because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1820
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:20.250
<v Speaker 1>infiltrate it to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of them were.</v>

1821
01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Well the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing the federal government </v>

1822
01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:28.131
<v Speaker 1>does good to infiltrate the mob with was</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting people to wear wires.</v>

1823
01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:33.040
<v Speaker 1>The good Adat yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>January in a wire or I forget where live</v>

1824
01:30:33.650 --> 01:30:36.240
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

1825
01:30:36.241 --> 01:30:41.241
<v Speaker 1>I think they protected me in that moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I could have had the shit kicked </v>

1826
01:30:41.241 --> 01:30:41.241
<v Speaker 1>out of me.</v>

1827
01:30:41.241 --> 01:30:41.241
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1828
01:30:41.241 --> 01:30:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I found out you were Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1829
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I am and I'm obviously fucking </v>

1830
01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1831
01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:51.090
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think people don't know anything </v>

1832
01:30:51.090 --> 01:30:51.090
<v Speaker 1>and they think all English people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>color.</v>

1833
01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:56.720
<v Speaker 1>It was my own stupid fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drove up the drive past all the signs </v>

1834
01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:58.650
<v Speaker 1>that said no Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews turn back now as,</v>

1835
01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:03.740
<v Speaker 1>as they surrounded me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did think to myself like if I get the </v>

1836
01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:03.960
<v Speaker 1>APP now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my own stupid fault.</v>

1837
01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:08.340
<v Speaker 1>So weird because it's a race and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>also religion.</v>

1838
01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1839
01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:13.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird,</v>

1840
01:31:13.230 --> 01:31:14.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1841
01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:17.670
<v Speaker 1>because you're European,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also Jewish,</v>

1842
01:31:17.730 --> 01:31:21.930
<v Speaker 1>which is a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a European atheist,</v>

1843
01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:24.390
<v Speaker 1>are you still a Jew?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1844
01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I am basically,</v>

1845
01:31:26.221 --> 01:31:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was to us with Elma </v>
<v Speaker 1>bakary the,</v>

1846
01:31:28.381 --> 01:31:30.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic fundamentalist and he,</v>

1847
01:31:30.210 --> 01:31:31.710
<v Speaker 1>he outed me as a Jew.</v>

1848
01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:34.960
<v Speaker 1>It is jihad training camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1849
01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A place called Crawley,</v>

1850
01:31:36.871 --> 01:31:38.880
<v Speaker 1>which is near Gatwick airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How rude.</v>

1851
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:41.280
<v Speaker 1>He said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at me with the infidel,</v>

1852
01:31:41.281 --> 01:31:46.281
<v Speaker 1>John who is a Jew and it all went and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1853
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:47.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1854
01:31:47.251 --> 01:31:49.320
<v Speaker 1>surely it's better to be a Jew than an </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist.</v>

1855
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:50.850
<v Speaker 1>And I heard someone in the crowd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1856
01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:54.000
<v Speaker 1>it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that really surprises me about</v>

1857
01:31:54.001 --> 01:31:59.001
<v Speaker 1>that exchange is that I am an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of all the places where I would </v>

1858
01:31:59.650 --> 01:32:01.990
<v Speaker 1>choose for the first time in my life to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut,</v>

1859
01:32:01.991 --> 01:32:06.991
<v Speaker 1>to exert my Jewishness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could chose a fucking g had training </v>

1860
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:12.350
<v Speaker 1>camp like wha what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self-Defeat you have second thoughts </v>

1861
01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:16.081
<v Speaker 1>about that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you in the midst of those people </v>

1862
01:32:16.081 --> 01:32:16.081
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I playing with here?</v>

1863
01:32:16.081 --> 01:32:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although quite quickly this,</v>

1864
01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:23.910
<v Speaker 1>the tension dissipated and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bunch of these young radical </v>

1865
01:32:24.551 --> 01:32:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Islamists all started asking me like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was like to be a Jew.</v>

1866
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:30.790
<v Speaker 1>They will like treating me like a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of tropical fish.</v>

1867
01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:35.820
<v Speaker 1>You would have babies to slug and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember leaving that Jihad training </v>

1868
01:32:35.921 --> 01:32:40.921
<v Speaker 1>camp that day thinking I'd done some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sterling work in bringing together </v>

1869
01:32:41.051 --> 01:32:46.051
<v Speaker 1>communities and you really believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I thought I believed it till like </v>

1870
01:32:46.051 --> 01:32:48.280
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't believe it anymore.</v>

1871
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I know most people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in that room at that scout hurt </v>

1872
01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:58.920
<v Speaker 1>went on to become suicide bombers and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill people and to drive fans into </v>

1873
01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:04.800
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a different world before nine </v>

1874
01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:05.230
<v Speaker 1>slash 11 though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fear of jihadis was much,</v>

1875
01:33:05.231 --> 01:33:06.730
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less prevalent.</v>

1876
01:33:06.731 --> 01:33:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made this funny.</v>

1877
01:33:07.901 --> 01:33:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I made this film called talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Martello.</v>

1878
01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I spent a year with Omar Bakri and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a kind of comic film about his </v>

1879
01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.270
<v Speaker 1>attempts to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1880
01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:22.380
<v Speaker 1>he said he wouldn't rest until we saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flag of Islam flying over Downing </v>

1881
01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Street.</v>

1882
01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:26.520
<v Speaker 1>So we made this sort of almost comic </v>
<v Speaker 1>film about his sort of blundering </v>

1883
01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:30.121
<v Speaker 1>attempts to create like Sharia law in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain and the joke of the film is at </v>

1884
01:33:30.121 --> 01:33:31.600
<v Speaker 1>ice is never gonna work and it was kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1885
01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of his ideas were ridiculous.</v>

1886
01:33:33.461 --> 01:33:38.461
<v Speaker 1>Like at one point he had these 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>black balloons carrying the call to war </v>

1887
01:33:39.361 --> 01:33:44.361
<v Speaker 1>and these little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like little leaflets like attached to </v>

1888
01:33:44.361 --> 01:33:44.530
<v Speaker 1>these balloons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1889
01:33:44.710 --> 01:33:48.130
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to slogans like Islam is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future of Britain and they were going to</v>

1890
01:33:48.131 --> 01:33:50.950
<v Speaker 1>like fly over London and La land </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever,</v>

1891
01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:54.150
<v Speaker 1>but they hadn't properly calculated like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1892
01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:58.320
<v Speaker 1>the weight ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these fucking balloon let them off.</v>

1893
01:33:58.350 --> 01:33:59.890
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like stayed on the floor.</v>

1894
01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:03.340
<v Speaker 1>So all year they will like failing at </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing everything.</v>

1895
01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1896
01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:11.420
<v Speaker 1>but len lye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like 96 and then five years </v>

1897
01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:11.650
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 happened.</v>

1898
01:34:11.650 --> 01:34:15.550
<v Speaker 1>And now Omar's in prison in Beirut for </v>
<v Speaker 1>inciting terrorism.</v>

1899
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:18.610
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of Omar's people became </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists.</v>

1900
01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:20.140
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Ronson,</v>

<v Speaker 2>real name Kelly.</v>

1919
01:35:17.010 --> 01:35:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1921
01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:25.601

<v Speaker 2>Then I went to the custody hearing </v>

1922
01:35:25.601 --> 01:35:27.401
<v Speaker 2>because I was just curious and I said to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot the last time I saw the two of </v>

1923
01:35:27.401 --> 01:35:31.031

<v Speaker 2>And then like 16 years passes and it's </v>

1925
01:35:33.401 --> 01:35:35.450
<v Speaker 2>the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like divorce at Texas has ever known.</v>

1926
01:35:36.850 --> 01:35:39.640
<v Speaker 2>That's what divorce lawyers were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the worst.</v>

1927
01:35:39.710 --> 01:35:44.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

01:35:44.710 --> 01:35:46.730
<v Speaker 2>So I say like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Alex has got a staff of like 75 </v>

1931

<v Speaker 2>supplement is male vitality supplements.</v>

1934
01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen the video of when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey Diaz and me are in our studio and </v>

1935
01:36:05.121 --> 01:36:10.121
<v Speaker 2>Joey realizes that it's on the intranet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so because it's on the Internet and he </v>

1936
01:36:10.221 --> 01:36:12.050
<v Speaker 2>could say whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we go,</v>

1937
01:36:12.051 --> 01:36:14.590
<v Speaker 2>we go live in our schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1938
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:17.210
<v Speaker 2>well actually from here on out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're on the Internet so you can kind of</v>

1939
01:36:17.211 --> 01:36:18.980
<v Speaker 2>say whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but try to keep it clean.</v>

1940
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:24.370
<v Speaker 2>And the look of it for Joey Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like the cat who saw the canary </v>

1941
01:36:25.461 --> 01:36:28.280
<v Speaker 2>and realize that the cage was open and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

1942
01:36:28.770 --> 01:36:32.000
<v Speaker 2>So he's telling some story about </v>
<v Speaker 2>smuggling weed through the airport.</v>

1943
01:36:32.001 --> 01:36:37.001
<v Speaker 2>Listen to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to your bullshit congressmen or </v>

1944
01:36:37.001 --> 01:36:39.731

01:37:54.081 --> 01:37:59.081
<v Speaker 2>do you think Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the know that the </v>

1975
01:37:59.081 --> 01:37:59.160
<v Speaker 2>spotlight is on them in a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented,</v>

1976

<v Speaker 2>famous like stressed out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

1977
01:38:05.290 --> 01:38:09.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never met a guy in my life that has</v>

1978
01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:13.020
<v Speaker 2>more teflon when it comes to stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm stressed out lately,</v>

1979
01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.330
<v Speaker 2>but I go to the gym and feel fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a cheeseburger,</v>

1980
01:38:15.331 --> 01:38:18.030
<v Speaker 2>probably shouldn't have that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to stick to my diet.</v>

1981
01:38:18.031 --> 01:38:21.150
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard when he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't give a fuck man.</v>

1982
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Like he's a weird guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's got a very unusual </v>

1983
01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:32.180
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I bet did stress them out </v>

1984
01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:32.180
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1985
01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:36.140
<v Speaker 2>there was a couple of pending lawsuits </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Chobani and Barney wasn't mean to </v>

1986
01:38:36.701 --> 01:38:37.470
<v Speaker 2>body through yoga.</v>

1987
01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.650
<v Speaker 2>People Buy Yogurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1988
01:38:40.651 --> 01:38:45.651
<v Speaker 2>He got into trouble with Chobani because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said they will like importing </v>

1989
01:38:45.651 --> 01:38:48.920
<v Speaker 2>rapists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1990
01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:54.560
<v Speaker 2>and of course he got into trouble with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pizza restaurant and I would bet me </v>

1991
01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.090
<v Speaker 2>pizza gate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Shit your info wars.</v>

1992
01:38:57.091 --> 01:39:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones apologized for saying Shabani</v>
<v Speaker 2>supports migrant rapists.</v>

1993
01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:03.600
<v Speaker 2>He didn't really say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1994
01:39:03.601 --> 01:39:08.601
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

1996
01:39:14.101 --> 01:39:18.750
<v Speaker 2>about because I think both of those were</v>
<v Speaker 2>risking his entire operation.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something.</v>

1998
01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:25.400
<v Speaker 2>It might stress you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if it was you and you were being </v>

1999
01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:26.460
<v Speaker 2>sued by Shabani,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd probably freaking out and be like,</v>

2000
01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:28.710
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've clearly made it horrible mistake.</v>

2001
01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I need to come clean and I need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>apologize.</v>

2002
01:39:31.021 --> 01:39:36.021
<v Speaker 2>I'm so paranoid that I freak out if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat a Chibani guava and think I'm like,</v>

2003
01:39:36.451 --> 01:39:41.451

<v Speaker 2>this is the most disgusting thing I've </v>

2004
01:39:41.451 --> 01:39:41.451
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

2005
01:39:41.451 --> 01:39:41.451
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I my,</v>

2006
01:39:41.451 --> 01:39:41.750
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my threshold for getting like,</v>

2007
01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:45.420
<v Speaker 2>panicky and stressed out is very low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible considering you are in</v>

2008
01:39:45.421 --> 01:39:46.860
<v Speaker 2>a jihadi camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2009
01:39:46.861 --> 01:39:47.610
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2010
01:39:47.650 --> 01:39:52.650
<v Speaker 2>I often wonder why I put myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's why it's so compelling when</v>

2011
01:39:53.581 --> 01:39:55.170
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2012
01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:57.980
<v Speaker 2>But Alex doesn't new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2013
01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know him,</v>

2014
01:39:59.071 --> 01:39:59.700
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2015
01:40:00.210 --> 01:40:02.500
<v Speaker 2>he's a different dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2016
01:40:02.501 --> 01:40:04.180
<v Speaker 2>like he's got like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2017
01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with a lot of the stuff he</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

2018
01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.690
<v Speaker 2>just like I don't agree with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff my friend Eddie says,</v>

2019
01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:11.300
<v Speaker 2>but I love the both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2020
01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.140
<v Speaker 2>it's weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I get it.</v>

2021
01:40:13.141 --> 01:40:18.141
<v Speaker 2>I get people saying that he's got too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much influence and he does know my take </v>

2022
01:40:18.451 --> 01:40:22.140
<v Speaker 2>is like if you really think there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking alien bases on the moon and that</v>

2023
01:40:22.141 --> 01:40:25.110
<v Speaker 2>there's child slaves on Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking shame on you.</v>

2024
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Shame on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2025
01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I think the deeper and the more crazy he</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

2026
01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:34.090
<v Speaker 2>the better his show is more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2027
01:40:34.650 --> 01:40:37.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bad person for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I am though.</v>

2028
01:40:38.530 --> 01:40:43.530
<v Speaker 2>You come in wondering why I put myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>in dangerous situations that would </v>

2029
01:40:43.530 --> 01:40:45.560
<v Speaker 2>really thinking about it a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

2030
01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's because people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety disorders,</v>

2031
01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:49.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2032
01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:53.010
<v Speaker 2>quite good when it comes to actual</v>

2033
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:56.770
<v Speaker 1>difficult situations because we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>rehearsed it so many times.</v>

2034
01:40:56.771 --> 01:41:01.771
<v Speaker 1>Like we panic unnecessarily so often the</v>
<v Speaker 1>when something really worth panicking </v>

2035
01:41:01.771 --> 01:41:03.280
<v Speaker 1>comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually handled it really well.</v>

2036
01:41:03.370 --> 01:41:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you,</v>

2037
01:41:04.230 --> 01:41:09.230
<v Speaker 1>has there ever been a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were confronted with an idea and </v>

2038
01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:09.230
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2039
01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:11.110
<v Speaker 1>that one is too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>

2040
01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was writing the manifesto goats,</v>

<v Speaker 1>soldiers who were trying to like walk </v>

2043

<v Speaker 1>through walls and visible and kills that</v>
<v Speaker 1>remote viewing as well.</v>

2044
01:41:24.970 --> 01:41:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Remote viewing was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

2045
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:27.610

<v Speaker 1>they were different,</v>

2046
01:41:27.611 --> 01:41:30.190
<v Speaker 1>but there was an overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met a bunch of those guys,</v>

2047
01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:35.370
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing that so far show right now </v>

<v Speaker 1>their names.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they found,</v>

2050
01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:44.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>various bad people using this weird </v>

2051

2055
01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:50.320
<v Speaker 1>So I met all of those people to remote </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewing sounds like really exciting,</v>

2056
01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:53.860
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychic spies in the military.</v>

2057

<v Speaker 1>labs were quite shit because basically </v>

2059
01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.830
<v Speaker 1>every one of them told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2060
01:42:06.190 --> 01:42:09.220
<v Speaker 1>because they were black up because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't officially exist,</v>

2061
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you have no coffee machine had to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring them coffee into work every day </v>

2062
01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:15.110
<v Speaker 1>because they couldn't justify having </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the,</v>

2063
01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:20.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room that they have been was really </v>

2064
01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:20.120
<v Speaker 1>bad because they couldn't get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>repaired because they didn't exist.</v>

2065
01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2066
01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:25.070
<v Speaker 1>so their lives are quite shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tell her how I,</v>

2067
01:42:25.090 --> 01:42:27.730
<v Speaker 1>how I came to this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was out.</v>

2068
01:42:27.731 --> 01:42:30.400
<v Speaker 1>This guy called Jim Schnabel had written</v>
<v Speaker 1>this book called remote viewers,</v>

2069
01:42:30.401 --> 01:42:31.260
<v Speaker 1>which kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2070
01:42:31.330 --> 01:42:32.650
<v Speaker 1>uncovered all of that stuff.</v>

2071
01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:37.870
<v Speaker 1>And there was this magician called ray </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyman who was like a skeptic.</v>

2072
01:42:37.871 --> 01:42:42.871
<v Speaker 1>I think he's dead now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The CIA brought him in to assess the </v>

2073
01:42:42.871 --> 01:42:47.611
<v Speaker 1>remote viewing program to see whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should keep it going or close it </v>

2074
01:42:47.611 --> 01:42:48.510
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2075
01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.560
<v Speaker 1>and ray hyman said it was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

2076
01:42:50.561 --> 01:42:53.920
<v Speaker 1>And so that helped them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The CIA close down the unit.</v>

2077
01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:57.670
<v Speaker 1>So I met Ray hyman and I just happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say to him,</v>

2078
01:42:57.671 --> 01:42:59.920
<v Speaker 1>it's like one of those questions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of changes your life.</v>

2079
01:43:00.370 --> 01:43:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I said to him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you were like in the military,</v>

2080
01:43:03.161 --> 01:43:05.530
<v Speaker 1>like sniffing around with the remote </v>
<v Speaker 1>view is,</v>

2081
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:10.950
<v Speaker 1>did you happen to notice anything else </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on anywhere you went?</v>

2082
01:43:11.231 --> 01:43:16.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said there was this general called </v>

2083
01:43:16.231 --> 01:43:18.080
<v Speaker 1>stubble bine who thought he could like </v>
<v Speaker 1>burst clouds with his mind and there's </v>

2084
01:43:18.491 --> 01:43:22.660
<v Speaker 1>this kernel called Channon who thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he could lie,</v>

2085
01:43:22.990 --> 01:43:26.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>train soldiers to like fast for a month.</v>

2086
01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:31.260
<v Speaker 1>And so I had these two names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stubble bone and Shannon and the whole </v>

2087
01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:31.350
<v Speaker 1>metastatic goat stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

2088
01:43:31.351 --> 01:43:33.140
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't out in the open all came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2089
01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:38.160
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing that they were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill goats just by staring at them </v>

2090
01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:38.370
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

2091
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:39.670
<v Speaker 1>So they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2092
01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:44.720
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met this guy who was that part of the </v>

2093
01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:45.460
<v Speaker 1>goat staying program and they had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all at Fort Bragg.</v>

2094
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a trip around Fort Bragg one time </v>

2095
01:43:50.910 --> 01:43:53.670
<v Speaker 1>and I to them like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so where's Gottlieb?</v>

2096
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to know about clap </v>

2097
01:43:59.050 --> 01:43:59.050
<v Speaker 1>lap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2098
01:43:59.050 --> 01:44:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they had like a one point,</v>

2099
01:44:00.081 --> 01:44:05.081
<v Speaker 1>they had like 30 goats in a room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all staring at to 16.</v>

2100
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:10.820
<v Speaker 1>They were like numbers on their backs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go number 17 fell over,</v>

2101
01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:15.320
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose there's collateral </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>

2102
01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would,</v>

2103
01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:21.170
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that if he stared at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>long enough it's going to fall over.</v>

2104
01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's going to fall over </v>

2105
01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:26.620
<v Speaker 1>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

2106
01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I was drinking water when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

2107
01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well No.</v>

2109
01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh well guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>severely.</v>

2110
01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:35.960

2112
01:44:41.741 --> 01:44:44.660
<v Speaker 1>studios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we tracked him down.</v>

2113
01:44:44.661 --> 01:44:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to him on the phone,</v>

2114
01:44:46.401 --> 01:44:51.401
<v Speaker 1>so do you still ever kill goats?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just by staring at them and he went </v>

2115
01:44:51.621 --> 01:44:52.910
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a matter of fact.</v>

2116
01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Just last week I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I killed my hamster just by staring at </v>

2117
01:44:58.540 --> 01:44:59.480
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like three days old.</v>

2118
01:44:59.690 --> 01:45:00.770
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2119
01:45:00.771 --> 01:45:02.690
<v Speaker 1>he said he caught it on video and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2120
01:45:02.691 --> 01:45:04.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we come and watch the video?</v>

2121
01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:06.080
<v Speaker 1>So we weren't said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2122
01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:09.980
<v Speaker 1>So we flew to Ohio to meet guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>severely.</v>

2123
01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole time his son was filming me </v>

2124
01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:16.370
<v Speaker 1>like the whole time I was there he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>filming me.</v>

2125
01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:21.820
<v Speaker 1>So eventually he admitted like why they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were filming me and it was that he was </v>

2126
01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:26.411
<v Speaker 1>worried that I might be al-Qaida let </v>
<v Speaker 1>China learn how to stare at people and </v>

2127
01:45:27.291 --> 01:45:28.370
<v Speaker 1>kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2128
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:31.010
<v Speaker 1>So he was like filming me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just inserting really believed it.</v>

2129
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So will this video,</v>

2130
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:37.940
<v Speaker 1>did it show him staring in Hampshire and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the video of the hamster staring.</v>

2131
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I should tell you about the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2132
01:45:39.111 --> 01:45:44.111
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment when I think I've pinpointed </v>

2133
01:45:44.111 --> 01:45:46.601
<v Speaker 1>the moment when they worked out that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't Al-qaida and it was because it </v>

2134
01:45:46.601 --> 01:45:49.970
<v Speaker 1>turns out that guy severely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his daughter is in the movie Chicago,</v>

2135
01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:52.500
<v Speaker 1>like is one of the dances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I Kinda,</v>

2136
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I kinda shrieked Oh I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I love Catherine Zeta Jones.</v>

2137
01:45:58.310 --> 01:46:02.210
<v Speaker 1>And I think they all kind of like a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of deep cover.</v>

2138
01:46:02.211 --> 01:46:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Al Qaeda operative wouldn't think to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>that feminists.</v>

01:46:06.831 --> 01:46:08.780
<v Speaker 1>So then they showed me the hubs to </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

2142
01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:13.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a hamster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure this is on youtube by the way.</v>

2143
01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2144
01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you can find this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's if you typed in,</v>

2145
01:46:18.590 --> 01:46:20.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Ronson,</v>

2146
01:46:20.961 --> 01:46:25.961
<v Speaker 1>hamster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy roads of the World Guy Savannah </v>

2147
01:46:25.961 --> 01:46:25.970
<v Speaker 1>was so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

2148
01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:29.960
<v Speaker 1>so perhaps just like running around in </v>
<v Speaker 1>its wheel and that guy's off camera,</v>

2149
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:34.990
<v Speaker 1>like staring at the hamster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then finally the Hampton gets off </v>

2150
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:37.850
<v Speaker 1>the whale and it's like all the sawdust </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the hamster light drops,</v>

2151
01:46:38.150 --> 01:46:43.150
<v Speaker 1>light stops moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drops down and stops moving amid the </v>

2152
01:46:43.150 --> 01:46:44.120
<v Speaker 1>sawdust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

2153
01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:49.150
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the hamster gets up again and </v>

2154
01:46:49.231 --> 01:46:50.280
<v Speaker 1>the video ends.</v>

2155
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:55.790
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not that guy said he flew all the</v>

2156
01:47:01.081 --> 01:47:05.130
<v Speaker 2>way to Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see a video of a hamster guy said,</v>

2157
01:47:05.131 --> 01:47:05.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2158
01:47:05.431 --> 01:47:07.140
<v Speaker 2>My wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife told me like,</v>

2159
01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:08.160
<v Speaker 2>not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife said,</v>

2160
01:47:08.161 --> 01:47:09.960
<v Speaker 2>don't show them the part with a hamster </v>
<v Speaker 2>dies.</v>

2161
01:47:11.850 --> 01:47:13.110

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2162
01:47:13.111 --> 01:47:18.111

<v Speaker 2>liberal and his wife told him to not </v>

2164
01:47:23.161 --> 01:47:26.520

<v Speaker 2>doesn't die.</v>

2249
01:51:41.370 --> 01:51:42.310

<v Speaker 2>This is deep.</v>

2250
01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:46.280
<v Speaker 2>This is really military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's wearing a military out.</v>

2251
01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know that guy went to Fort Bragg </v>

2252
01:51:52.711 --> 01:51:55.440
<v Speaker 2>and depakote stuff like he showed me </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentation,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but see this right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen man.</v>

2254
01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I used to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look stupid.</v>

2255
01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:02.780
<v Speaker 2>He picked his leg up when he's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2256
01:52:02.781 --> 01:52:05.130
<v Speaker 2>this is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids can do at his fingertips.</v>

2257
01:52:05.690 --> 01:52:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Hi My right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2258
01:52:09.010 --> 01:52:11.060
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>

2259
01:52:11.061 --> 01:52:16.061
<v Speaker 2>like real young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to do these demonstrations when </v>

2260
01:52:16.121 --> 01:52:17.340
<v Speaker 2>I was like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2261
01:52:17.630 --> 01:52:20.660
<v Speaker 2>When we would open up a new school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you do these demonstrations?</v>

2262
01:52:20.661 --> 01:52:23.270
<v Speaker 2>And it was the only time we ever broke </v>
<v Speaker 2>boards.</v>

2263
01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:26.090
<v Speaker 2>We fucking never presents really easy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2264
01:52:26.370 --> 01:52:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Looks hard to the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but working on hot coals right?</v>

2265
01:52:29.530 --> 01:52:32.900
<v Speaker 2>It's way easier than walking on hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>coals because those things,</v>

2266
01:52:33.050 --> 01:52:35.650
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they're cut is with the car.</v>

2267
01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:40.700
<v Speaker 2>Like the grain is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going in a matter of how.</v>

2268
01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:42.350
<v Speaker 2>What's the way we describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they give you.</v>

2269
01:52:42.351 --> 01:52:47.351
<v Speaker 2>You're holding something up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The is actually going in the way that </v>

2270
01:52:47.351 --> 01:52:49.790
<v Speaker 2>you want it to break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're breaking it with the grain you</v>

2271
01:52:49.791 --> 01:52:51.950
<v Speaker 2>literally can do with your fingers like </v>
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>

2272
01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:55.130
<v Speaker 2>You could take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are thin pieces of wood to you can</v>

2273
01:52:55.131 --> 01:53:00.131
<v Speaker 2>take this piece of if this would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this pad was a would you would just </v>

2274
01:53:00.131 --> 01:53:02.930
<v Speaker 2>go like this with two fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go snap and would break bricks like</v>

2275
01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:03.320
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

2276
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:06.680
<v Speaker 2>I was 15 and when we do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>karate kicks and punches and stuff,</v>

2277
01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:09.110
<v Speaker 2>they always broke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always broke.</v>

2278
01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:11.450
<v Speaker 2>So what are so easy to break?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the question now,</v>

2279
01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:16.451
<v Speaker 2>what does it say about like special </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces at Fort Brag that they would </v>

2280
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:19.900
<v Speaker 2>bring a guy in today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They brought that guy in.</v>

2281
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it wasn't like.</v>

2282
01:53:20.901 --> 01:53:25.901
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe it was like an sanction </v>

2283
01:53:25.901 --> 01:53:28.061
<v Speaker 2>from the very top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he certainly went to Fort Bragg and </v>

2284
01:53:28.061 --> 01:53:30.350
<v Speaker 2>stared at goats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He stared at goats at Fort Bragg.</v>

2285
01:53:30.410 --> 01:53:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're probably just grabbed whatever </v>

2286
01:53:35.410 --> 01:53:35.410
<v Speaker 2>dummies they could find like it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some dudes want to stare at a goat.</v>

2287
01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's one thing that is a fact.</v>

2288
01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:44.080
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in the eighties and the </v>

2289
01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:45.560
<v Speaker 2>nineties before the ultimate fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>championship came around.</v>

2290
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:48.740
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of fake martial arts out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2291
01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:53.860
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people that were teaching fake </v>

2292
01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:55.430
<v Speaker 2>martial arts that got into the military </v>
<v Speaker 2>that got into the police.</v>

2293
01:53:55.700 --> 01:54:00.700
<v Speaker 2>I knew the guy who was deep in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>police force and he had fake martial </v>

2294
01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:01.280
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like his martial arts.</v>

<v Speaker 2>tallies with the US military Crete </v>

2296
01:54:06.981 --> 01:54:09.020
<v Speaker 2>olive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like thinking out the box,</v>

2297
01:54:09.021 --> 01:54:11.150
<v Speaker 2>like if we don't try this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody else will try.</v>

2298
01:54:11.151 --> 01:54:14.570
<v Speaker 2>This is going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're blurring easy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but then stepper,</v>

2304
01:54:28.570 --> 01:54:33.570
<v Speaker 2>pride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>general stuff about who I'm sure would </v>

2305
01:54:33.570 --> 01:54:33.570
<v Speaker 2>have been a fan of this show because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

2306
01:54:33.570 --> 01:54:36.710
<v Speaker 2>he was a big fan of Alex's and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was head of army intelligence.</v>

2307
01:54:36.711 --> 01:54:41.711
<v Speaker 2>He had 16,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers under his command and he </v>

2308
01:54:41.711 --> 01:54:42.200
<v Speaker 2>totally believed in all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believed in that stuff.</v>

2309
01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:47.400
<v Speaker 2>But that guy was doing general stubble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stubborn would when he was head of army </v>

2310
01:54:47.481 --> 01:54:52.070
<v Speaker 2>intelligence in Arlington would try and </v>

01:54:53.210 --> 01:54:56.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>atoms.</v>

2315

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me the key word this is most mostly a</v>

2316
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.780
<v Speaker 2>big part of that.</v>

2317
01:55:10.930 --> 01:55:13.100
<v Speaker 2>He would like stand up from behind his </v>
<v Speaker 2>desk.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but in fact he was trying to get away </v>

2327
01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:40.211
<v Speaker 2>from this wall walk and an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to merge the spaces </v>

2328
01:55:40.211 --> 01:55:41.600
<v Speaker 2>between that and just kept pumping his </v>
<v Speaker 2>nose.</v>

2329
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2330
01:55:42.501 --> 01:55:43.200
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2331
01:55:43.230 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2332
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:45.060
<v Speaker 1>This was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

2333
01:55:45.110 --> 01:55:48.930
<v Speaker 1>my couple of years and when I did the a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scifi show,</v>

2334
01:55:48.931 --> 01:55:53.931
<v Speaker 1>we did a whole segment on remote viewing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we actually had a guy who claimed to</v>

2335
01:55:54.811 --> 01:55:59.811
<v Speaker 1>be a successful remote viewer and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we set up this location and asked him,</v>

2336
01:56:01.050 --> 01:56:04.160
<v Speaker 1>me and Dj growthy Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2337
01:56:04.190 --> 01:56:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Who's a skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2338
01:56:05.790 --> 01:56:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2339
01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:09.510
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dj was just as accurate,</v>

2340
01:56:09.690 --> 01:56:10.700
<v Speaker 1>just guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2341
01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Because this guy was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2342
01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I think actually now that I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Dj was more accurate,</v>

2343
01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:18.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

2344
01:56:18.730 --> 01:56:23.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of dark secret remote feeling </v>

2345
01:56:23.730 --> 01:56:23.730
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an account,</v>

2346
01:56:23.730 --> 01:56:25.140
<v Speaker 1>you can't sort of totally blame the </v>
<v Speaker 1>remote viewers for this.</v>

2347
01:56:25.141 --> 01:56:30.141
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the remote viewing unit for made got </v>

2348
01:56:30.141 --> 01:56:34.130
<v Speaker 1>declassified and shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of these remote viewers then </v>

2349
01:56:34.130 --> 01:56:38.130
<v Speaker 1>set up their own training centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the Danes in,</v>

2350
01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe in Vegas,</v>

2351
01:56:39.181 --> 01:56:43.770
<v Speaker 1>some or some are not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at Dame's had this student</v>

2352
01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:45.900
<v Speaker 9>cool</v>

2353
01:56:46.110 --> 01:56:48.160
<v Speaker 1>neato says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2354
01:56:48.650 --> 01:56:53.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a woman called court May and </v>

2355
01:56:53.650 --> 01:56:55.120
<v Speaker 1>then there was this other students have </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten their names anyway,</v>

2356
01:56:55.121 --> 01:56:58.510
<v Speaker 1>but they would then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at times taught them remote viewing,</v>

2357
01:56:58.750 --> 01:57:03.750
<v Speaker 1>these two people who would then go on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the art bell show and they became light </v>

2358
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:04.110
<v Speaker 1>lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2359
01:57:04.150 --> 01:57:07.570
<v Speaker 1>regular guests on the show and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones.</v>

2360
01:57:07.670 --> 01:57:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Then these two have ed dames and </v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

2361
01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:15.120
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones who basically announced</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the bell show that the Hale Bopp </v>

2362
01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:18.940
<v Speaker 1>comet had a companion object in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>tail.</v>

2363
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.440
<v Speaker 1>It remote viewed that help up comment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was about to pass over the earth,</v>

2364
01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:28.680
<v Speaker 1>how to companion object in its tail and </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to the art bell show was the </v>

2365
01:57:30.161 --> 01:57:35.161
<v Speaker 1>heaven's Gate Group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they decided that that was the </v>

2366
01:57:35.161 --> 01:57:35.710
<v Speaker 1>spaceship they were waiting for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2367
01:57:35.711 --> 01:57:38.170
<v Speaker 1>So they all killed themselves to get on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spaceship.</v>

2368
01:57:39.730 --> 01:57:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Prudence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kalibrasi and another guy whose name I </v>

2369
01:57:44.730 --> 01:57:44.730
<v Speaker 1>forgot.</v>

2370
01:57:44.730 --> 01:57:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2371
01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:47.520
<v Speaker 1>So that's the sort of weird butterfly </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

2372
01:57:47.650 --> 01:57:48.880
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2373
01:57:49.210 --> 01:57:54.210
<v Speaker 1>That whole thing was such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing where people want to </v>

2374
01:57:54.210 --> 01:57:57.451
<v Speaker 1>believe now this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it goes back to conspiracy </v>

2375
01:57:57.451 --> 01:58:00.331
<v Speaker 1>theorists or whether it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the remote viewers or even someone who </v>

2376
01:58:00.331 --> 01:58:04.951
<v Speaker 1>would watch that guy's karate videos and</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that he's really doing death </v>

2377
01:58:04.951 --> 01:58:08.041
<v Speaker 1>touches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about it as a method of </v>

2378
01:58:08.041 --> 01:58:08.530
<v Speaker 1>going through the skin to attack the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon.</v>

2379
01:58:08.531 --> 01:58:09.960
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2380
01:58:09.970 --> 01:58:11.520
<v Speaker 1>He told me all of that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2381
01:58:11.530 --> 01:58:13.910
<v Speaker 1>he showed me a photograph of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2382
01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:19.020
<v Speaker 1>well actually he accidentally showed me </v>
<v Speaker 1>a photograph of him karate chopping a </v>

2383
01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:22.030
<v Speaker 1>goat that you weren't supposed to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one.</v>

2384
01:58:22.031 --> 01:58:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

2385
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:27.550
<v Speaker 1>He did the death touch on a goat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what you could fuck a goat up </v>

2386
01:58:27.551 --> 01:58:28.890
<v Speaker 1>if you hit it in the right spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2387
01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:34.020
<v Speaker 1>A lot of indignities meted out to goats </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the US military.</v>

2388
01:58:34.670 --> 01:58:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're actually pretty tough though,</v>

2389
01:58:36.171 --> 01:58:41.171
<v Speaker 1>now that I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you probably couldn't kill a goat </v>

2390
01:58:41.171 --> 01:58:41.171
<v Speaker 1>with a karate chop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2391
01:58:41.171 --> 01:58:42.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to really</v>

2392
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:45.280
<v Speaker 2>hit it hard in the bright spot in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>

2393
01:58:45.670 --> 01:58:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Is it true that in the movie adaptation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my book,</v>

2394
01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:55.080
<v Speaker 2>the metastatic goats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a kind of bit of comedy where </v>

2395
01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:58.520
<v Speaker 2>somebody thinks that they fell victim to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the death touch that,</v>

2396
01:58:59.170 --> 01:59:02.860
<v Speaker 2>but it happened like years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 years ago,</v>

2397
01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:06.280
<v Speaker 2>he was given the death touch and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's dying from it.</v>

2398
01:59:06.281 --> 01:59:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Twenty five years later was in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

2399
01:59:08.410 --> 01:59:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was in the movie.</v>

2400
01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:12.800
<v Speaker 2>Is it true in like the death touch world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the world?</v>

2401
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Is it true that some people think like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can touch them now and that's the </v>

2402
01:59:20.450 --> 01:59:21.820
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

2403
01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2404
01:59:25.710 --> 01:59:28.490
<v Speaker 2>that's the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying,</v>

2405
01:59:29.050 --> 01:59:34.050
<v Speaker 2>so is it true in the death touch world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people think you can do the dim </v>

2406
01:59:34.050 --> 01:59:37.510
<v Speaker 2>back on someone and they'd die years </v>
<v Speaker 2>later of seemingly natural causes?</v>

2407
01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:39.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that someone who believes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2408
01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2409

<v Speaker 2>I mean if you see that guy that was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>having,</v>

2410
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:46.300

<v Speaker 2>crazy stuff and the guy falls down?</v>

<v Speaker 2>You might have missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2412
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:49.910

2414
01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other guy,</v>

2415
01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:55.070
<v Speaker 2>he does all the this using an English </v>
<v Speaker 2>word for you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2419
02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people that believe all kinds of</v>

2420
02:00:03.971 --> 02:00:04.660
<v Speaker 2>crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2421
02:00:04.661 --> 02:00:09.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he definitely inspired the characters </v>

2422
02:00:09.661 --> 02:00:10.720
<v Speaker 2>into metastatic goats movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen what happens when one</v>

2423
02:00:10.721 --> 02:00:13.870
<v Speaker 2>of these fake death touch guys fights a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real fighter?</v>

2424
02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:15.650
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I kind of get to shit,</v>

2425
02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:20.660
<v Speaker 2>get terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few of them racked and these </v>

2426
02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:24.451
<v Speaker 2>guys just don't seem to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them that was recently in China </v>

2427
02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:29.580
<v Speaker 2>was so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so poorly received that the guy who was </v>

2428
02:00:29.621 --> 02:00:34.621
<v Speaker 2>the MMA fighter had to go into hiding </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he beat the living fuck out of </v>

2429
02:00:34.621 --> 02:00:38.641
<v Speaker 2>this guy in like 10 seconds later the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy came out and did all this crazy </v>

2430
02:00:38.641 --> 02:00:39.810
<v Speaker 2>stuff when they go to smashes him in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>face,</v>

2431
02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:43.990
<v Speaker 2>mma style and his con food's no good </v>
<v Speaker 2>this day.</v>

2432
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:48.990
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're the young guy in orange shoes </v>

2433
02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:54.360
<v Speaker 2>who's like a legit fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other guy who is this silly</v>

2434
02:00:54.911 --> 02:00:59.560
<v Speaker 2>death touch guy dressed up like he's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a different century and like,</v>

2435
02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:04.680
<v Speaker 2>watch how this goes down because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible because this guy on the left </v>

2436
02:01:05.410 --> 02:01:10.410
<v Speaker 2>with the orange sneakers on is a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>train fighter and this other guy has a </v>

2437
02:01:11.801 --> 02:01:16.300
<v Speaker 2>real belief in this system that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been practicing under and he has no idea</v>

2438
02:01:16.301 --> 02:01:20.500
<v Speaker 2>that it's horseshit and the way finds </v>
<v Speaker 2>out that it's horseshit is on youtube.</v>

2439
02:01:21.250 --> 02:01:24.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean he literally finds out in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment that what he's doing,</v>

2440
02:01:24.611 --> 02:01:26.580
<v Speaker 2>he probably believed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He brought,</v>

2441
02:01:26.650 --> 02:01:30.220
<v Speaker 2>probably believed that what he does is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually real and effective.</v>

2442
02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:32.290
<v Speaker 2>So check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible.</v>

2443
02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:35.590
<v Speaker 2>The good together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah Blah.</v>

2444
02:01:35.591 --> 02:01:37.990
<v Speaker 2>They go over what you're supposed to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

2445
02:01:38.650 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they make</v>

2446
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:45.070
<v Speaker 3>them shake hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shake hands and then they go back </v>

2447
02:01:45.070 --> 02:01:47.360
<v Speaker 3>and then they get the party started and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes 10 seconds.</v>

2448
02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:49.070
<v Speaker 3>Here we go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ready?</v>

2449
02:01:49.071 --> 02:01:50.150
<v Speaker 3>Set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

2450
02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:57.080
<v Speaker 3>There it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy's like literally doing like </v>

2451
02:02:00.110 --> 02:02:05.110
<v Speaker 3>some movie stuff and the boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the MMA guy just starts taking off.</v>

2452
02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

2453
02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:13.130
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

2454
02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:14.390
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

2455
02:02:14.810 --> 02:02:17.450
<v Speaker 3>And that's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible.</v>

2456
02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it literally last once he engages</v>

2457
02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:26.530
<v Speaker 3>in the last 10 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's because one of them is doing </v>

2458
02:02:26.530 --> 02:02:30.431
<v Speaker 3>an actual martial art and the other guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>practicing nonsense and he's probably </v>

2459
02:02:30.431 --> 02:02:33.140
<v Speaker 3>practiced that nonsense his whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought it was real.</v>

2460
02:02:33.410 --> 02:02:38.410
<v Speaker 3>There's another one where there's an old</v>
<v Speaker 3>man and that's even harder to watch </v>

2461
02:02:38.410 --> 02:02:41.150
<v Speaker 3>because there's old man gets kicked in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the face and you just go,</v>

2462
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:43.790
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like save this guy.</v>

2463
02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:48.850
<v Speaker 3>This was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he looks like legitimately like </v>

2464
02:02:48.850 --> 02:02:50.060
<v Speaker 3>let's watch what he does back it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to the beginning.</v>

2465
02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:52.940
<v Speaker 3>So he bet $5,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check this out,</v>

2466
02:02:53.190 --> 02:02:57.280
<v Speaker 3>look what he thinks he can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He claimed a 200 and orx.</v>

2467
02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:58.580
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not even touching these people.</v>

2468
02:02:58.581 --> 02:03:01.520
<v Speaker 3>They just go flying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're a part of a cult,</v>

2469
02:03:01.770 --> 02:03:04.880
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they move at him and he really firmly</v>

2470
02:03:04.881 --> 02:03:06.590
<v Speaker 3>believes that he can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2471
02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:09.710
<v Speaker 3>he's like manipulating them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's a puppet master.</v>

2472
02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:13.880
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy is so.</v>

2473
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:19.870
<v Speaker 3>He's so like hypnotized by his own </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit that he decides,</v>

2474
02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:22.790
<v Speaker 3>well he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2475
02:03:23.170 --> 02:03:24.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2476
02:03:24.081 --> 02:03:29.081
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he actually makes a real fight </v>

2477
02:03:29.081 --> 02:03:32.060
<v Speaker 3>with a real trained martial artist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he might,</v>

2478
02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:35.930
<v Speaker 3>he may very well have been in on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>

2479
02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:40.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean not being what I mean is he </v>
<v Speaker 3>might've been taken by his own bullshit.</v>

2480
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:45.410
<v Speaker 3>He might've actually believed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now he's gonna fly an actual,</v>

2481
02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:48.350
<v Speaker 3>a young actual martial artist.</v>

2482
02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:53.680
<v Speaker 3>And so he's got this crazy idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just going to like give that guy </v>

2483
02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:57.041
<v Speaker 3>the hex and the guy is going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>flying through the air like the other </v>

2484
02:03:57.041 --> 02:03:59.000
<v Speaker 3>guy was teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this kid just sort of circles,</v>

2485
02:03:59.001 --> 02:04:00.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a few seconds.</v>

2486
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:02.500
<v Speaker 3>And then just like that other video </v>
<v Speaker 3>pizza,</v>

2487
02:04:02.570 --> 02:04:06.260
<v Speaker 3>holy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Out of them inside of about 10 seconds,</v>

2488
02:04:06.380 --> 02:04:09.540
<v Speaker 3>just zoom off until they engage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2489
02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:12.380
<v Speaker 3>So here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>

2490
02:04:12.381 --> 02:04:13.010
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2491
02:04:13.011 --> 02:04:16.820
<v Speaker 3>all this craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the young martial artists just grabs</v>

2492
02:04:16.821 --> 02:04:17.750
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>punches him,</v>

2493
02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:20.410
<v Speaker 3>kick some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

2494
02:04:20.411 --> 02:04:21.010
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he like,</v>

2495
02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:22.760
<v Speaker 3>he's holding his face is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

2496
02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:24.200
<v Speaker 3>And the young guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really nice look.</v>

2497
02:04:24.201 --> 02:04:24.550
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2498
02:04:24.551 --> 02:04:25.940
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to keep going?</v>

2499
02:04:26.150 --> 02:04:27.670
<v Speaker 3>And he's holding his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2500
02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:30.050
<v Speaker 3>the young guy like literally says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2501
02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:32.660
<v Speaker 3>does he want to keep going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's stop.</v>

2502
02:04:32.661 --> 02:04:37.661
<v Speaker 3>Let's stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] guy's bleeding out of his </v>

2503
02:04:37.661 --> 02:04:37.661
<v Speaker 3>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he says,</v>

2504
02:04:37.661 --> 02:04:38.040
<v Speaker 3>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says</v>

2505
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he gets his hands up,</v>

2506
02:04:40.201 --> 02:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>but he's now this time it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

2507
02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:46.350
<v Speaker 1>This time I'm going to hit them with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>full Voodoo and this kid just blam Blam,</v>

2508
02:04:46.351 --> 02:04:48.480
<v Speaker 1>blam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this kick boom.</v>

2509
02:04:48.810 --> 02:04:53.190
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that guy's probably like 60.</v>

2510
02:04:53.660 --> 02:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a good time to get kicked in the </v>

2511
02:04:58.660 --> 02:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2512
02:04:58.660 --> 02:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm remembering,</v>

2513
02:04:58.660 --> 02:05:01.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about the metastatic that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matched it was so long ago,</v>

2514
02:05:01.231 --> 02:05:03.000
<v Speaker 1>but now I'm remembering some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

2515
02:05:03.690 --> 02:05:05.160
<v Speaker 1>some of the other stuff that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

2516
02:05:05.610 --> 02:05:07.620
<v Speaker 1>And there was a lot of weaponry stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2517
02:05:07.621 --> 02:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>there was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2518
02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:11.100
<v Speaker 1>there was the prophet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hologram,</v>

2519
02:05:11.550 --> 02:05:14.610
<v Speaker 1>all of this sort of came from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>central well of like,</v>

2520
02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:16.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties profit,</v>

2521
02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:18.540
<v Speaker 1>hologram that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would,</v>

2522
02:05:18.590 --> 02:05:21.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never liked got it off the ground,</v>

2523
02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:26.240
<v Speaker 1>but what they were trying to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a Hologram of Allah that they would</v>

2524
02:05:27.090 --> 02:05:29.330
<v Speaker 1>project over an enemy capital.</v>

2525
02:05:29.610 --> 02:05:31.550
<v Speaker 1>We're an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allah would basically say whatever the u</v>

2526
02:05:31.551 --> 02:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>s military wanted him to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans aren't that bad.</v>

2527
02:05:36.670 --> 02:05:39.000
<v Speaker 1>They are blessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Bush,</v>

2528
02:05:39.390 --> 02:05:43.320
<v Speaker 1>they had a race specific stink bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which again,</v>

2529
02:05:43.321 --> 02:05:44.610
<v Speaker 1>they never managed to get off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

2530
02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:45.950
<v Speaker 1>What about the gay bomb?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

2531
02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:47.460
<v Speaker 1>they had the gay bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was real.</v>

2532
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally were engineering some </v>

2533
02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:54.981
<v Speaker 1>sort of a chemical warfare device that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would turn men homosexual and lit lit.</v>

2534
02:05:55.680 --> 02:06:00.680
<v Speaker 1>And what's less known about it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they will also trying to do a halitosis </v>

2535
02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:03.150
<v Speaker 1>bomb so that you'd turn the enemy gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he gave him bad breath.</v>

2536
02:06:03.170 --> 02:06:08.170
<v Speaker 1>You haven't gave him bad breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd be like so freaked out that the </v>

2537
02:06:08.170 --> 02:06:10.311
<v Speaker 1>Americans were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd come in and when they would just </v>

2538
02:06:10.311 --> 02:06:10.311
<v Speaker 1>have shame all around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2539
02:06:10.311 --> 02:06:12.090
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had um,</v>

2540
02:06:12.330 --> 02:06:14.870
<v Speaker 1>attack attack bees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2541
02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:18.030
<v Speaker 1>that would again just attack the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of these things got off the ground,</v>

2542
02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's sort of like writing </v>

2543
02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You throw a lot of shit against the wall</v>

2544
02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:24.650
<v Speaker 1>and like one 10th of it sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2545
02:06:27.210 --> 02:06:29.280
<v Speaker 1>And some things did stick right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I immediately,</v>

2546
02:06:29.710 --> 02:06:34.710
<v Speaker 1>the Taser gave me from the military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that seems totally reasonable </v>

2547
02:06:34.710 --> 02:06:39.201
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows you can get </v>

2548
02:06:39.201 --> 02:06:40.131
<v Speaker 1>electrocuted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured out a way to get a large </v>

2549
02:06:40.131 --> 02:06:40.131
<v Speaker 1>charge and a small device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2550
02:06:40.170 --> 02:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>And there was all this kind of weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our old,</v>

2551
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:47.470
<v Speaker 1>our old techniques that they would do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>on to animo in Abu Ghraib or Romania or </v>

2552
02:06:47.470 --> 02:06:47.740
<v Speaker 1>oral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2553
02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I probably said it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2554
02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Where they would like play executive </v>
<v Speaker 1>templates.</v>

2555
02:06:52.401 --> 02:06:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Subliminal sounds blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd blast like Metallica at people,</v>

2556
02:06:56.731 --> 02:07:01.731
<v Speaker 1>but laced into metallica would be these </v>
<v Speaker 1>like subliminal sounds that will try to </v>

2557
02:07:01.731 --> 02:07:06.290
<v Speaker 1>hypnotize people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when they used to do </v>

2558
02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:06.290
<v Speaker 1>that in movie theaters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungry Popcorn?</v>

2559
02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:10.700
<v Speaker 1>They live like subliminal images that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will like in between like one fifth of a</v>

2560
02:07:13.051 --> 02:07:16.610
<v Speaker 1>second one frame has ever been shown </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that actually worked.</v>

2561
02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that I ever worked in the.</v>

2562
02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I met this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2563
02:07:20.341 --> 02:07:25.341
<v Speaker 1>I just remembered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I met this guy called Jamal Harris </v>

2564
02:07:25.341 --> 02:07:28.370
<v Speaker 1>who had been released from Guantanamo </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was telling me about all of this </v>

2565
02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:32.571
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in Guantanamo for like two years </v>

2566
02:07:32.571 --> 02:07:32.571
<v Speaker 1>and then he got released and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me about this app.</v>

2567
02:07:32.571 --> 02:07:36.230
<v Speaker 1>He said they played him and entire cd </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a fleetwood Mac cuff band,</v>

2568
02:07:41.930 --> 02:07:46.750
<v Speaker 1>abnormal in Guantanamo at normal volume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are just fucking winging it,</v>

2569
02:07:48.030 --> 02:07:50.020
<v Speaker 1>winging it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was going on?</v>

2570
02:07:50.270 --> 02:07:54.260
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm set up with.</v>

2571
02:07:54.261 --> 02:07:59.261
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it to be nice and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought you want to make it more </v>

2572
02:07:59.261 --> 02:07:59.980
<v Speaker 1>pleasant and he said this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was good to me.</v>

2573
02:07:59.981 --> 02:08:01.330
<v Speaker 1>They weren't trying to be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2574
02:08:01.331 --> 02:08:06.331
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed Jamal Harris was telling </v>

2575
02:08:06.331 --> 02:08:08.941
<v Speaker 1>me about all of this weird shit and few </v>
<v Speaker 1>months ago he goes and fucking joins </v>

2576
02:08:09.221 --> 02:08:11.320
<v Speaker 1>isis and blows himself up somewhere.</v>

2577
02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:14.320
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fleetwood Mac cover band guy.</v>

2578
02:08:14.770 --> 02:08:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they arrested him and brought him </v>

2579
02:08:19.770 --> 02:08:20.830
<v Speaker 1>to Guantanamo Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was he innocent of those charges?</v>

2580
02:08:20.890 --> 02:08:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he certainly convinced everybody that he</v>

2581
02:08:23.351 --> 02:08:25.720
<v Speaker 1>was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2582
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:30.990
<v Speaker 1>in fact Tony Blair got involved and </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped get him out of one on to be a </v>

2583
02:08:31.901 --> 02:08:32.920
<v Speaker 1>jihadi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2584
02:08:32.921 --> 02:08:37.921
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd be very curious to find out </v>

2585
02:08:37.921 --> 02:08:37.921
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the question that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just post.</v>

2586
02:08:37.921 --> 02:08:42.801
<v Speaker 1>Like was he always it or did the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of being in Guantanamo </v>

2587
02:08:42.801 --> 02:08:44.130
<v Speaker 1>somehow years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2588
02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:46.870
<v Speaker 1>help to turn him into a god?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the answer to.</v>

2589
02:08:46.910 --> 02:08:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're an innocent person and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for two years they take away your </v>

2590
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:54.820
<v Speaker 1>freedom and they make you listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleetwood Mac cover band,</v>

2591
02:08:55.180 --> 02:08:58.000
<v Speaker 1>you probably feel like I can't get over </v>
<v Speaker 1>that man.</v>

2592
02:08:58.340 --> 02:09:00.850
<v Speaker 1>It's stained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stained my soul.</v>

2593
02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I met this guy very personable young</v>

2594

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2595
02:09:04.930 --> 02:09:09.160

<v Speaker 1>I interviewed him for the monster go.</v>

2596
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:11.260
<v Speaker 1>And where do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did he kill himself?</v>

02:10:41.630 --> 02:10:43.910
<v Speaker 2>His name's John John Copeland Hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2630
02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:49.480
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he apparently found this girl he was </v>

2631
02:10:49.731 --> 02:10:50.960
<v Speaker 2>dating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they broke up.</v>

2632
02:10:51.230 --> 02:10:56.230
<v Speaker 2>He found her in bed with another man and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the beating him and beating her </v>

2633
02:10:57.140 --> 02:11:00.530
<v Speaker 2>half to death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ruptured her liver broker ribs,</v>

2634
02:11:00.531 --> 02:11:02.570
<v Speaker 2>smashed her face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broker teeth.</v>

2635
02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrific.</v>

2636
02:11:05.050 --> 02:11:07.760
<v Speaker 2>And she was here with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2637
02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:13.120
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it was steroids to the </v>

2638
02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:13.610
<v Speaker 2>goodwill is psychopathy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2639
02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:18.790
<v Speaker 2>all the above.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think steroids probably played a </v>

2640
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:21.431
<v Speaker 2>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Traumatic brain injury probably paid a </v>

2641
02:11:21.431 --> 02:11:21.431
<v Speaker 2>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2642
02:11:21.431 --> 02:11:23.170
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what they say about Chris</v>
<v Speaker 2>Penn Law,</v>

2643
02:11:23.171 --> 02:11:25.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it was traumatic brain injury.</v>

2644
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:28.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge factor because these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2645
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.420
<v Speaker 2>they get hit in the head so many times </v>
<v Speaker 2>and no,</v>

2646
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:34.100
<v Speaker 2>no one can tell you when it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go bad.</v>

2647
02:11:34.130 --> 02:11:35.060
<v Speaker 2>No one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2648
02:11:35.090 --> 02:11:40.090
<v Speaker 2>it varies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you might be able to take a 100 </v>

2649
02:11:40.090 --> 02:11:40.090
<v Speaker 2>punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me it might be 30,</v>

2650
02:11:40.090 --> 02:11:41.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one knows it doesn't,</v>

2651
02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:44.250
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2652
02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:49.480
<v Speaker 2>And you don't know what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>absorbing and training versus what </v>

2653
02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:50.080
<v Speaker 2>happens in actual fights in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2654
02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:55.300
<v Speaker 2>and what the effect it has on one person</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very differently affected house and </v>

2655
02:11:55.300 --> 02:11:57.770
<v Speaker 2>another person also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2656
02:11:57.771 --> 02:12:02.771
<v Speaker 2>how uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much time is in between these </v>

2657
02:12:02.771 --> 02:12:05.990
<v Speaker 2>beatings that they've received?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they receiving them on a regular </v>

2658
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:05.990
<v Speaker 2>basis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It changed them like instantaneously.</v>

2659
02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I know far too many people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced a lot of,</v>

2660
02:12:10.670 --> 02:12:14.480
<v Speaker 2>a lot of shots to the head where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely changed who they are.</v>

2661
02:12:14.570 --> 02:12:15.560
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2662
02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:18.540
<v Speaker 2>This guy was troubled to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

2663
02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:22.190
<v Speaker 2>he saw his father die beaten up by cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't at the store.</v>

2664
02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that was a store something </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up experience at a very young </v>

2665
02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:27.580
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>

2666
02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:32.430
<v Speaker 2>I wonder whether this booklet a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopath test and um,</v>

2667
02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:37.130
<v Speaker 2>I met a guy once I got into like a road </v>
<v Speaker 2>rage instance with this guy.</v>

2668
02:12:37.670 --> 02:12:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had like,</v>

2669
02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:42.610
<v Speaker 2>my son was one at the time and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2670
02:12:43.300 --> 02:12:45.830
<v Speaker 2>out of the car and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my son's in the car and he said,</v>

2671
02:12:45.831 --> 02:12:50.831
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck about your son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And afterwards one of the psychopath </v>

2672
02:12:50.831 --> 02:12:51.890
<v Speaker 2>test I was a member of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's being like,</v>

2673
02:12:51.891 --> 02:12:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I wonder whether he was a psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder whether like,</v>

2674
02:12:54.621 --> 02:12:58.160
<v Speaker 2>given that one of the items on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopathic checklist is like grandiose</v>

2675
02:12:58.161 --> 02:13:03.161
<v Speaker 2>sense of self worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to with it with the mixed </v>

2676
02:13:03.161 --> 02:13:03.380
<v Speaker 2>martial artist world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that,</v>

2677
02:13:03.770 --> 02:13:08.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's sort of attracts </v>

2678
02:13:08.770 --> 02:13:08.770
<v Speaker 2>psychopaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2679
02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:11.810
<v Speaker 2>it certainly attracts people that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to violence,</v>

2680
02:13:12.730 --> 02:13:16.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're engaging in violence.</v>

2681
02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:19.520
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also attracts people that are just,</v>

2682
02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:24.790
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might've been bmx riders or </v>

2683
02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:26.020
<v Speaker 2>skateboarders or sky divers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2684
02:13:26.070 --> 02:13:28.910
<v Speaker 2>they love the extreme danger aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2685
02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:30.830
<v Speaker 2>They're thrill seekers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I,</v>

2686
02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:31.950
<v Speaker 2>the way I described,</v>

2687
02:13:32.570 --> 02:13:37.350
<v Speaker 3>I described mixed martial arts is high </v>
<v Speaker 3>level problem solving with dire physical</v>

2688
02:13:37.351 --> 02:13:40.890
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's really essentially what it is</v>

2689
02:13:40.891 --> 02:13:44.790
<v Speaker 3>and these guys are attracted to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme experiences.</v>

2690
02:13:45.270 --> 02:13:47.220
<v Speaker 3>So some of them are very pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2691
02:13:47.221 --> 02:13:49.020
<v Speaker 3>some of them are very nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2692
02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:50.880
<v Speaker 3>like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mighty mouse.</v>

2693
02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:53.070
<v Speaker 3>It's probably the best pound for pound </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter ever.</v>

2694
02:13:53.190 --> 02:13:54.540
<v Speaker 3>If you met him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would never know.</v>

2695
02:13:54.541 --> 02:13:56.520
<v Speaker 3>He's the best fighter in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the sweetest guy.</v>

2696
02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:58.800
<v Speaker 3>So normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very articulate,</v>

2697
02:13:58.830 --> 02:14:01.020
<v Speaker 3>easy to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't get hit a lot either though.</v>

2698
02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:04.680
<v Speaker 3>He's so slick and smart and the way he </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights is so clever.</v>

2699
02:14:05.490 --> 02:14:09.390
<v Speaker 3>But some of them get hit a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2700
02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:14.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that we're knowing more and more </v>

2701
02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:17.840
<v Speaker 3>essentially every day about the effects </v>
<v Speaker 3>of traumatic brain injuries and </v>

2702
02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:22.280
<v Speaker 3>concussions and you're seeing more and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more of these stories of football </v>

2703
02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:22.530
<v Speaker 3>players doing crazy things.</v>

2704
02:14:22.530 --> 02:14:27.530
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure you saw that recent study </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they tested 111 football players </v>

2705
02:14:27.530 --> 02:14:30.350
<v Speaker 3>and they found 110 of them had traumatic</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain injuries.</v>

2706
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would I know that that's what they said </v>

2707
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:35.390
<v Speaker 3>about Crispin Law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's why he.</v>

2708
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2709
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Those guys get it for sure in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people say,</v>

2710
02:14:38.071 --> 02:14:39.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fake wrestling.</v>

2711
02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:44.180
<v Speaker 3>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing fake about what those </v>

2712
02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:44.430
<v Speaker 3>guys go through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might be choreographed,</v>

2713
02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:46.710
<v Speaker 3>they might have a bunch of things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing,</v>

2714
02:14:46.711 --> 02:14:51.711
<v Speaker 3>but these guys are body slamming each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other and throwing each other through </v>

2715
02:14:51.711 --> 02:14:52.620
<v Speaker 3>the air and landing on each other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting each other with elbows.</v>

2716
02:14:52.621 --> 02:14:57.621
<v Speaker 3>That is a 100 percent real and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffer and you have to be tough to do </v>

2717
02:14:57.621 --> 02:14:58.410
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There they are,</v>

2718
02:14:58.710 --> 02:15:03.710
<v Speaker 3>experiencing some severe pain forensic </v>
<v Speaker 3>exam.</v>

2719
02:15:04.510 --> 02:15:09.510
<v Speaker 3>He's crispin was brain forensic exam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistent with numerous brain injuries.</v>

2720
02:15:09.691 --> 02:15:14.691
<v Speaker 3>CTE,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is found in all regions of his </v>

2721
02:15:14.691 --> 02:15:16.170
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy.</v>

2722
02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a paper about crispin for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guardian and when it came out at 1:00</v>

2723
02:15:21.841 --> 02:15:26.841
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they a press officer for wwe phoned me </v>

2724
02:15:26.841 --> 02:15:31.641
<v Speaker 1>up and yelled at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yelled at one in the morning because I </v>

2725
02:15:31.641 --> 02:15:33.560
<v Speaker 1>said what that like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tricked the mentor,</v>

2726
02:15:33.630 --> 02:15:37.980
<v Speaker 1>like spending time backstage at wwe when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was only interested in Christian.</v>

2727
02:15:37.981 --> 02:15:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you write?</v>

2728
02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Did you go backstage before he killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

2729
02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:44.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was after.</v>

2730
02:15:44.341 --> 02:15:45.900
<v Speaker 1>It was afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2731
02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:49.560
<v Speaker 1>The trick them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'd trick them.</v>

2732
02:15:49.650 --> 02:15:54.650
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck could they think that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to put a positive spin on </v>

2733
02:15:54.650 --> 02:15:55.290
<v Speaker 1>someone murdering their family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2734
02:15:55.680 --> 02:16:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to put less </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on crispin well and more </v>

2735
02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:00.680
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2736
02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:02.100
<v Speaker 1>the nice things about wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Jesus Christ,</v>

2737
02:16:02.101 --> 02:16:04.500
<v Speaker 1>but you knew you were going to put some </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on it,</v>

2738
02:16:04.501 --> 02:16:04.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2739
02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I was asking lots of questions.</v>

2740
02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:09.800
<v Speaker 1>So they must've known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2741
02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of Nice people,</v>

2742
02:16:11.881 --> 02:16:14.910
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my porn people,</v>

2743
02:16:15.690 --> 02:16:20.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably the loveliest year of my</v>

2744
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:22.830
<v Speaker 1>working life's hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really young people.</v>

2745
02:16:22.831 --> 02:16:27.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you've got all that work </v>

2746
02:16:27.831 --> 02:16:27.831
<v Speaker 1>done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe,</v>

2747
02:16:27.831 --> 02:16:27.831
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple days.</v>

2748
02:16:27.831 --> 02:16:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just taking what I wanted to know.</v>

2749
02:16:32.730 --> 02:16:37.730
<v Speaker 1>A lot of digging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounded like dicking with your </v>

2750
02:16:37.730 --> 02:16:38.470
<v Speaker 1>accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a lot of dicking.</v>

2751
02:16:38.540 --> 02:16:39.990
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

2752
02:16:40.170 --> 02:16:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explain yourself.</v>

2753
02:16:42.011 --> 02:16:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm just joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2754
02:16:43.540 --> 02:16:45.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no it was,</v>

2755
02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:49.810
<v Speaker 1>it was tracing the butterfly factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fabian's business plan on their world.</v>

2756
02:16:50.530 --> 02:16:53.860
<v Speaker 1>It was such a kind of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>

2757
02:16:53.861 --> 02:16:54.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2758
02:16:55.090 --> 02:16:59.350
<v Speaker 1>to try and work out what's the furthest </v>
<v Speaker 1>ripple I could find,</v>

2759
02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:01.390
<v Speaker 1>like what light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2760
02:17:01.391 --> 02:17:06.391
<v Speaker 1>So Fabian has this idea about giving the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world free porn and then that leads to </v>

2761
02:17:06.391 --> 02:17:07.590
<v Speaker 1>that and that needs to happen at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>like where,</v>

2762
02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:10.820
<v Speaker 1>what's the furthest I could find the </v>
<v Speaker 1>furthest consequence.</v>

2763
02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:15.820
<v Speaker 1>And it was such a sort of fun exercise </v>
<v Speaker 1>coupled with the fact that being around </v>

2764
02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:18.940
<v Speaker 1>porn people was a little bit like being </v>
<v Speaker 1>on at a Broadway show,</v>

2765
02:17:18.941 --> 02:17:19.850
<v Speaker 1>backstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2766
02:17:19.890 --> 02:17:20.780
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2767
02:17:20.810 --> 02:17:24.340
<v Speaker 1>theater people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So coupled with all of that and the fact</v>

2768
02:17:24.341 --> 02:17:26.680
<v Speaker 1>that I was in la and I got to let hang </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in la.</v>

2769
02:17:26.681 --> 02:17:28.120
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really fun.</v>

2770
02:17:28.121 --> 02:17:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you,</v>

2771
02:17:29.331 --> 02:17:34.331
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the strangest consequences that </v>

2772
02:17:34.331 --> 02:17:34.331
<v Speaker 1>should address,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2773
02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:36.890
<v Speaker 1>so this um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2774
02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:41.900
<v Speaker 1>like pretty much every child in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world gets learned about sex through </v>

2775
02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:45.150
<v Speaker 1>porn hub these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>PORNHUB is sex education for like every </v>

2776
02:17:45.150 --> 02:17:48.751
<v Speaker 1>12 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure as a parents probably don't go </v>

2777
02:17:48.751 --> 02:17:50.350
<v Speaker 1>around talking about it in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2778
02:17:50.351 --> 02:17:51.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2779
02:17:51.460 --> 02:17:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I think when we were growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

2780
02:17:53.620 --> 02:17:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 was probably about the age that we </v>

2781
02:17:58.620 --> 02:18:01.471
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like seeing ripped up pages of playboy </v>

2782
02:18:01.471 --> 02:18:02.870
<v Speaker 1>and bridges and so on.</v>

2783
02:18:03.430 --> 02:18:05.410
<v Speaker 1>We would find them in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2784
02:18:05.510 --> 02:18:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I have a whole bit on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my act.</v>

2785
02:18:07.150 --> 02:18:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2786
02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:12.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about finding perversion was true story </v>

2787
02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:16.881
<v Speaker 1>I'd done literally didn't know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>perversion until I found a fucked up </v>

2788
02:18:16.881 --> 02:18:18.820
<v Speaker 1>magazine in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the magazine?</v>

2789
02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:23.880
<v Speaker 1>It was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called foot action or </v>

2790
02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:24.460
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very strange.</v>

2791
02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:26.540
<v Speaker 1>But here's what's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2792
02:18:26.590 --> 02:18:29.380
<v Speaker 1>that kids today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give them a phone,</v>

2793
02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:30.670
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2794
02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:35.700
<v Speaker 1>what age the kids get a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some kids get a phone at like 10 </v>

2795
02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:37.180
<v Speaker 1>and nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're essentially giving um,</v>

2796
02:18:37.210 --> 02:18:38.100
<v Speaker 1>porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2797
02:18:38.140 --> 02:18:41.680
<v Speaker 1>You're giving them every awfulness that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've given them.</v>

2798
02:18:41.681 --> 02:18:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beheading.</v>

2799
02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2800
02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:46.900
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was really interested in like,</v>

2801
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:51.910
<v Speaker 1>so what are the consequences of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like 12 year old kids learning about </v>

2802
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:54.460
<v Speaker 1>sex through porn hub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I found this terrible consequence in</v>

2803
02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma.</v>

2804
02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:58.960
<v Speaker 1>So this was a boy called Nathan with </v>
<v Speaker 1>autism,</v>

2805
02:18:58.961 --> 02:19:02.050
<v Speaker 1>so he was like an awkward kid with </v>
<v Speaker 1>autism,</v>

2806
02:19:02.470 --> 02:19:07.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>channels like chat up a girl but didn't </v>

2807
02:19:07.470 --> 02:19:08.200
<v Speaker 1>know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he thought that the smartest,</v>

2808
02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:09.940
<v Speaker 1>he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2809
02:19:10.270 --> 02:19:15.270
<v Speaker 1>he thought he should text her lines of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue that he'd heard in porn films.</v>

2810
02:19:16.690 --> 02:19:19.520
<v Speaker 1>So he texted her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2811
02:19:19.630 --> 02:19:23.140
<v Speaker 1>first detected a bunch of Hentai porn </v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs,</v>

2812
02:19:23.610 --> 02:19:25.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she didn't respond.</v>

2813
02:19:26.290 --> 02:19:29.330
<v Speaker 1>So I said if she responded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you have done?</v>

2814
02:19:29.331 --> 02:19:30.240
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've stopped.</v>

2815
02:19:30.270 --> 02:19:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Like if she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you stop sending me these,</v>

2816
02:19:31.941 --> 02:19:36.941
<v Speaker 1>what would you have done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said I would have stopped sending </v>

2817
02:19:36.941 --> 02:19:36.941
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just assumed she was busy.</v>

2818
02:19:36.941 --> 02:19:41.510
<v Speaker 1>So then he texted her line of dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he heard in a porn film and it was,</v>

2819
02:19:41.780 --> 02:19:45.380
<v Speaker 1>I want to bend you over and rape you </v>
<v Speaker 1>from behind.</v>

2820
02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:50.920
<v Speaker 1>So he is now on the sex offenders </v>
<v Speaker 1>registry for 25 years,</v>

2821
02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:57.160
<v Speaker 1>which means he has to live in a house </v>
<v Speaker 1>right at the edge of town because he has</v>

2822
02:19:58.431 --> 02:20:02.420
<v Speaker 1>to be 2000 feet away from parks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>daycare centers.</v>

2823
02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:07.010
<v Speaker 1>He can't go anywhere where children go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he can't go to football games,</v>

2824
02:20:07.220 --> 02:20:09.950
<v Speaker 1>basketball games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't go to the Er was uh,</v>

2825
02:20:10.050 --> 02:20:13.630
<v Speaker 1>he was 17 and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2826
02:20:13.660 --> 02:20:15.200
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 18,</v>

2827
02:20:15.470 --> 02:20:20.470
<v Speaker 1>but kids as young as eight years old or </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the sex offenders registry in the </v>

2828
02:20:20.470 --> 02:20:21.650
<v Speaker 1>United States eat eight years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>

2829
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys and girls,</v>

2830
02:20:23.610 --> 02:20:25.550
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you play,</v>

2831
02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:28.680
<v Speaker 1>there's this little boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2832
02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:33.760
<v Speaker 1>they were like playing this game where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd take their clothes off in the </v>

2833
02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:34.460
<v Speaker 1>dark and then put the clothes back on </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

2834
02:20:34.461 --> 02:20:39.461
<v Speaker 1>That budget manual kits or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one kid kept his clothes off when </v>

2835
02:20:39.461 --> 02:20:42.590
<v Speaker 1>they turned the lights on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl complained to her parents.</v>

2836
02:20:42.590 --> 02:20:44.780
<v Speaker 1>And this boy is on the sex offenders </v>
<v Speaker 1>register.</v>

2837
02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2838
02:20:46.730 --> 02:20:49.030
<v Speaker 1>so you can't like if a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with Nathan,</v>

2839
02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:50.720
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck where the parents,</v>

2840
02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:52.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2841
02:20:52.690 --> 02:20:55.760
<v Speaker 1>on unsurprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2842
02:20:55.880 --> 02:21:00.880
<v Speaker 1>I think this kid was a foster kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's already like the sort of </v>

2843
02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:03.210
<v Speaker 1>stigma attached to the shadow of stigma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2844
02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Nathan's a kid with autism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said to this woman who like defense</v>

2845
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:11.590
<v Speaker 1>children on the sex offenders registry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to a light so you know,</v>

2846
02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:16.600
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why doesn't the judge just say this is </v>

2847
02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:17.030
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous and throw it out of court?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

2848
02:21:17.031 --> 02:21:22.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this kind of prevailing view </v>

2849
02:21:22.031 --> 02:21:22.970
<v Speaker 1>that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better to protect,</v>

2850
02:21:23.460 --> 02:21:28.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better to err on the side of </v>

2851
02:21:28.460 --> 02:21:28.460
<v Speaker 1>caution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2852
02:21:28.460 --> 02:21:32.410
<v Speaker 1>but also there's this prevailing view </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if a kid starts acting sexually </v>

2853
02:21:32.410 --> 02:21:36.611
<v Speaker 1>weird at the age of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a precursor for them being </v>

2854
02:21:36.611 --> 02:21:40.871
<v Speaker 1>sexually weird when an adult maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not.</v>

2855
02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2856
02:21:41.991 --> 02:21:43.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's true in certain cases.</v>

2857
02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:48.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consequences of sentencing and kid </v>

2858
02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:52.481
<v Speaker 1>like that are so extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you should probably have a real </v>

2859
02:21:52.481 --> 02:21:54.630
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kid and if he's autistic and he does</v>

2860
02:21:54.631 --> 02:21:56.810
<v Speaker 1>know what the fuck to do and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>confused and he.</v>

2861
02:21:57.260 --> 02:21:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Nathan.</v>

2863
02:22:03.461 --> 02:22:05.090

<v Speaker 1>And so he was like,</v>

2864
02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:06.500
<v Speaker 1>reading me the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you know,</v>

2865
02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:11.740
<v Speaker 1>a lot about 20 now he's going to be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sex offender registry for the next </v>

2866
02:22:11.740 --> 02:22:13.940
<v Speaker 1>23 years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it like talking to him as well?</v>

2867
02:22:13.970 --> 02:22:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Does your understand the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't went down?</v>

2868
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says it's like being permanently </v>

2869
02:22:21.070 --> 02:22:21.980
<v Speaker 1>grounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was reading me the questions,</v>

2870
02:22:21.981 --> 02:22:23.700
<v Speaker 1>not system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sex offenders book.</v>

2871
02:22:23.700 --> 02:22:28.700
<v Speaker 1>So it's questions like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever had a sexual situation in </v>

2872
02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:32.160
<v Speaker 1>which you're in or feces was involved?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his answer was no.</v>

2873
02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:35.430
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were questions like,</v>

2874
02:22:35.610 --> 02:22:38.190
<v Speaker 1>have you ever had sex with animals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his question was like,</v>

2875
02:22:38.191 --> 02:22:43.191
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the last question was when was </v>

2876
02:22:43.191 --> 02:22:45.630
<v Speaker 1>the last time you had sex with somebody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And His answer was still a virgin,</v>

2877
02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:51.030
<v Speaker 1>a virgin on the sex offenders registry </v>
<v Speaker 1>was when you can only cost,</v>

2878
02:22:51.031 --> 02:22:56.031
<v Speaker 1>you can understand what the girl was </v>
<v Speaker 1>scared and I told her parents and the </v>

2879
02:22:56.031 --> 02:22:56.730
<v Speaker 1>parents talk to the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can tell you understand it from</v>

2880
02:22:56.731 --> 02:22:58.500
<v Speaker 1>the other point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2881
02:22:58.501 --> 02:22:59.610
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2882
02:23:00.050 --> 02:23:00.750
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2883
02:23:00.751 --> 02:23:04.440
<v Speaker 1>what a butterfly effect that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not,</v>

2884
02:23:04.441 --> 02:23:09.441
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying any of this is Fabian's </v>

2885
02:23:09.441 --> 02:23:11.691
<v Speaker 1>fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all had intended intended </v>

2886
02:23:11.691 --> 02:23:12.330
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just access to sex in porn.</v>

2887
02:23:12.330 --> 02:23:17.330
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that's weird as a porn </v>

2888
02:23:17.330 --> 02:23:18.360
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean other than this bespoke porn,</v>

2889
02:23:18.361 --> 02:23:20.940
<v Speaker 1>which is very specific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but porn,</v>

2890
02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:26.960
<v Speaker 1>there's like levels to the depravity </v>
<v Speaker 1>that never existed before yet because </v>

2891
02:23:28.381 --> 02:23:33.381
<v Speaker 1>everything's keyword search.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well at least this is what happens when </v>

2892
02:23:33.381 --> 02:23:34.350
<v Speaker 1>you let tech people run the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ramping up.</v>

2893
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:38.340
<v Speaker 1>It's also people get tired of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>people kissing and then having sex.</v>

2894
02:23:38.370 --> 02:23:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then it's like,</v>

2895
02:23:39.650 --> 02:23:41.760
<v Speaker 1>oh I want to watch a guy at tire grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2896
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh I want to watch you guys spitting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl's mouth.</v>

2897
02:23:43.890 --> 02:23:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I want to watch her get smacked around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it gets weirder and gagging.</v>

2898
02:23:47.761 --> 02:23:52.761
<v Speaker 1>And although this is exactly that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one consequence of the </v>

2899
02:23:52.761 --> 02:23:57.531
<v Speaker 1>ubiquity of like Freeport and just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheer volume of stand out with extreme </v>

2900
02:23:58.950 --> 02:24:03.950
<v Speaker 1>content some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing is already search </v>

2901
02:24:03.950 --> 02:24:05.340
<v Speaker 1>engine people are sort of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's being searched for the most.</v>

2902
02:24:05.490 --> 02:24:06.690
<v Speaker 1>What is number one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2903
02:24:06.691 --> 02:24:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you what it's like a room.</v>

2904
02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's an important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you what's really like way</v>

2905
02:24:12.121 --> 02:24:17.121
<v Speaker 1>at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's anything to do with like step </v>

2906
02:24:17.121 --> 02:24:18.210
<v Speaker 1>sisters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stepbrothers,</v>

2907
02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:20.830
<v Speaker 1>stepfathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>step daughters,</v>

2908
02:24:21.500 --> 02:24:24.450
<v Speaker 1>mom's incest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Porn is basically,</v>

2909
02:24:24.780 --> 02:24:29.780
<v Speaker 1>it's basically real incest away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But actually when I was on the set of </v>

2910
02:24:29.780 --> 02:24:33.590
<v Speaker 1>stepdaughter cheerleader orgy Grazer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the director that,</v>

2911
02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:36.290
<v Speaker 1>there was a bit of dialogue like these </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys will like say I go,</v>

2912
02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I think your stepdaughter is sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it kept on getting it wrong and they</v>

2913
02:24:41.461 --> 02:24:43.480
<v Speaker 1>were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think your daughter sexy,</v>

2914
02:24:43.530 --> 02:24:47.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's step that backfired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The carriers go step daughter.</v>

2915
02:24:48.570 --> 02:24:51.180
<v Speaker 1>That's all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to be too fucked up here.</v>

2916
02:24:51.181 --> 02:24:53.970
<v Speaker 1>People step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keyword step,</v>

2917
02:24:54.260 --> 02:24:55.320
<v Speaker 1>go right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take one.</v>

2918
02:24:55.710 --> 02:24:58.890
<v Speaker 1>These are great people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met people with great people.</v>

2919
02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Well that's nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2920
02:25:00.350 --> 02:25:03.990
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of shatter some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes that people are about porn.</v>

2921
02:25:04.410 --> 02:25:09.090
<v Speaker 1>That the people are sleazy and uncaring </v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing coke and smacking each other.</v>

2922
02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:10.840
<v Speaker 1>This show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2923
02:25:10.950 --> 02:25:14.100
<v Speaker 1>if I may blow my own trumpet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please do a,</v>

2924
02:25:14.101 --> 02:25:17.790
<v Speaker 1>which I learned on the set of blow my </v>
<v Speaker 1>own trumpet,</v>

2925
02:25:19.730 --> 02:25:21.660
<v Speaker 1>a I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2926
02:25:21.870 --> 02:25:24.540
<v Speaker 1>I did a little bit the butterfly effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2927
02:25:24.570 --> 02:25:28.630
<v Speaker 1>on stage at the ace hotel down in Los </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles here in Los Angeles.</v>

2928
02:25:28.930 --> 02:25:33.930
<v Speaker 1>And we've invited a bunch of our porn </v>
<v Speaker 1>people along and they said to us </v>

2929
02:25:33.930 --> 02:25:36.640
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 25 years of being important,</v>

2930
02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:42.610
<v Speaker 1>we were the first mainstream people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come along and not treat them as like,</v>

2931
02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:45.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients in our preexisting ideology.</v>

2932
02:25:45.641 --> 02:25:50.641
<v Speaker 1>So not pitying them or attacking them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just treating them on a level as a </v>

2933
02:25:51.041 --> 02:25:53.820
<v Speaker 1>fellow human being and isn't that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of nuts that,</v>

2934
02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:58.860
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's rare in porn because we all feel </v>

2935
02:25:58.860 --> 02:25:59.230
<v Speaker 1>sort of society as mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists,</v>

2936
02:25:59.231 --> 02:26:01.950
<v Speaker 1>we filled these kinds of societal </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressures to,</v>

2937
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:03.420
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2938
02:26:03.490 --> 02:26:04.840
<v Speaker 1>in some way attack them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2939
02:26:04.850 --> 02:26:07.660
<v Speaker 1>they're there to be pitied there to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hated,</v>

2940
02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:08.970
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2941
02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:11.100
<v Speaker 3>well I think you also have to establish </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're,</v>

2942
02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:16.240
<v Speaker 3>your own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's moral superiority or good </v>

2943
02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:18.290
<v Speaker 3>taste that you don't approve of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not one of those people.</v>

2944
02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:23.500
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even a kind of sore of this </v>

2945
02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:23.500
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

2946
02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2947
02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:25.550
<v Speaker 1>I made my excuses and left that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2948
02:26:25.850 --> 02:26:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2949
02:26:27.410 --> 02:26:29.750
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means,</v>

2950
02:26:29.751 --> 02:26:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of our hypocrisy,</v>

2951
02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:36.700
<v Speaker 1>they get exploited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I wanted to do this show.</v>

2952
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry that I sort of bought it back </v>
<v Speaker 1>full circle,</v>

2953
02:26:39.171 --> 02:26:41.120
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of the reasons why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do this show.</v>

2954
02:26:41.170 --> 02:26:46.170
<v Speaker 3>When I first moved to California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on the Sitcom called news radio </v>

2955
02:26:46.170 --> 02:26:50.131
<v Speaker 3>and one of the guys who was a writer on </v>
<v Speaker 3>news radio was a writer for porn films </v>

2956
02:26:50.131 --> 02:26:52.330
<v Speaker 3>on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what it was was it didn't really pay</v>

2957
02:26:52.331 --> 02:26:57.331
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it gave him access to the girls and </v>

2958
02:26:57.331 --> 02:26:59.470
<v Speaker 3>they let him meet these girls and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a nebbishy sort of Dorky guy and</v>

2959
02:26:59.820 --> 02:27:03.820
<v Speaker 3>he had never been around like a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>bomb shell girl that was willing to have</v>

2960
02:27:03.821 --> 02:27:06.840
<v Speaker 3>sex with them before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all of a sudden he's having sex these</v>

2961
02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:09.940
<v Speaker 3>porn stars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they get to have sex with these guys</v>

2962
02:27:09.941 --> 02:27:12.680
<v Speaker 3>on set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like some of this weird thing</v>

2963
02:27:12.690 --> 02:27:14.350
<v Speaker 3>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was his girlfriend,</v>

2964
02:27:14.351 --> 02:27:19.351
<v Speaker 3>but she would go to work and get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit fucked out of her by a bunch </v>

2965
02:27:19.351 --> 02:27:19.450
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how did they feel about that?</v>

2966
02:27:19.660 --> 02:27:22.000
<v Speaker 3>This is what the straw that broke the </v>
<v Speaker 3>camel's back.</v>

2967
02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:24.370
<v Speaker 3>He was having dinner with her and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2968
02:27:24.371 --> 02:27:25.450
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so tired.</v>

2969
02:27:25.451 --> 02:27:28.420
<v Speaker 3>I do an anal scene all day today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

2970
02:27:28.450 --> 02:27:29.840
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was,</v>

2971
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:32.500

<v Speaker 3>he in his mind,</v>

2972
02:27:32.501 --> 02:27:36.160
<v Speaker 3>he was able to put that barrier up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what she does is just work.</v>

2973
02:27:36.250 --> 02:27:37.350
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2974
02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:39.940
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go to dinner and have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful time.</v>

2975
02:27:39.941 --> 02:27:41.860
<v Speaker 3>Candlelight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine wine,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I didn't love with her.</v>

2977
02:27:44.921 --> 02:27:46.960
<v Speaker 3>She's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>

2978
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:49.000
<v Speaker 3>she was tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was complaining about take it in the</v>

2979
02:27:49.001 --> 02:27:50.860
<v Speaker 3>ass all day and he was like,</v>

2980
02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:53.530
<v Speaker 3>please get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they split up.</v>

2981
02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:58.900
<v Speaker 3>I got another one who wasn't my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a friend of a friend who told</v>

2982
02:27:58.901 --> 02:28:03.901
<v Speaker 3>me this story that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy was dating this girl and you </v>

2983
02:28:03.901 --> 02:28:03.901
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just the same thing.</v>

2984
02:28:03.901 --> 02:28:04.330
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2985
02:28:04.331 --> 02:28:06.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>switch does relive in no big deal.</v>

2986
02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:12.060
<v Speaker 3>And he read or contract and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's air tight and airtight is a dick </v>

2987
02:28:17.081 --> 02:28:19.110
<v Speaker 3>and every hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

2988
02:28:20.250 --> 02:28:25.250
<v Speaker 1>check please this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

2989
02:28:26.090 --> 02:28:28.490
<v Speaker 1>So the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first guy that took me to a set,</v>

2990
02:28:29.180 --> 02:28:31.810
<v Speaker 1>and this is like in [inaudible] 94.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2991
02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:34.820
<v Speaker 1>So this was the pretty keyword pre </v>
<v Speaker 1>fabian days,</v>

2992
02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:36.830
<v Speaker 1>pre Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2993
02:28:37.010 --> 02:28:42.010
<v Speaker 1>they were all rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was rich and the porn stars </v>

2994
02:28:42.010 --> 02:28:45.680
<v Speaker 1>like real stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Janine and Jill Kelly who were </v>

2995
02:28:45.891 --> 02:28:48.620
<v Speaker 1>very famous porn stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lesbian scene.</v>

2996
02:28:48.621 --> 02:28:53.621
<v Speaker 1>And there was a scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was a cartoon character or </v>

2997
02:28:53.621 --> 02:28:57.281
<v Speaker 1>comic book character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This woman wrote and she came to life </v>

2998
02:28:57.281 --> 02:28:57.380
<v Speaker 1>and they were having a lesbian scene </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

2999
02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:01.040
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really weird because like,</v>

3000
02:29:01.041 --> 02:29:06.041
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she knew that we were watching and </v>

3001
02:29:06.041 --> 02:29:10.301
<v Speaker 1>so there was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just like air of theatrical </v>

3002
02:29:10.301 --> 02:29:13.710
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm that was very forced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they would do the scenes.</v>

3003
02:29:13.711 --> 02:29:15.560
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my job,</v>

3004
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I love my job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My job is amazing.</v>

3005
02:29:18.370 --> 02:29:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Look at my friend at the time I was on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm buying all this.</v>

3006
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just seems weird.</v>

3007
02:29:25.430 --> 02:29:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I remember Mike Quiz me on my first pool</v>
<v Speaker 1>and set this director who kind of </v>

3008
02:29:30.430 --> 02:29:35.051
<v Speaker 1>embedded ourselves with said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that there's a wisp of </v>

3009
02:29:35.051 --> 02:29:36.590
<v Speaker 1>darkness dot everybody who does this </v>
<v Speaker 1>other thing.</v>

3010
02:29:36.650 --> 02:29:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whispered.</v>

3011
02:29:38.430 --> 02:29:40.670
<v Speaker 1>That's what's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why,</v>

3012
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:43.250
<v Speaker 1>what is it like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's illogical.</v>

3013
02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:48.410
<v Speaker 1>If you look at it on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like everyone who is healthy,</v>

3014
02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:53.500
<v Speaker 1>whose body functions correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy sexual relations,</v>

3015
02:29:54.170 --> 02:29:58.220
<v Speaker 1>whether it's straight sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay sex or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

3016
02:29:58.610 --> 02:30:01.280
<v Speaker 1>People like to be touched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of being a person.</v>

3017
02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so shameful when other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to watch?</v>

3018
02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:10.720
<v Speaker 1>And why is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it devastate people when they </v>

3019
02:30:10.720 --> 02:30:14.561
<v Speaker 1>find out that their loved one had done </v>
<v Speaker 1>something on film that others can see </v>

3020
02:30:14.561 --> 02:30:15.470
<v Speaker 1>and when they leave poor.</v>

3021
02:30:15.470 --> 02:30:19.250
<v Speaker 1>And this is another consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fabian I look at in my show,</v>

3022
02:30:19.251 --> 02:30:24.251
<v Speaker 1>is that when they leave porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much more likely that that,</v>

3023
02:30:24.470 --> 02:30:25.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they leave Poland,</v>

3024
02:30:25.370 --> 02:30:27.740
<v Speaker 1>they go to a different part of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started a new life.</v>

3025
02:30:27.980 --> 02:30:32.270
<v Speaker 1>It's much more likely that they'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed then in the nineties,</v>

3026
02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:35.560
<v Speaker 1>like in the nineties for next porn star </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be outdated.</v>

3027
02:30:35.950 --> 02:30:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Someone would have to go to like a DVD </v>
<v Speaker 1>shop and Brian these days everybody just</v>

3028
02:30:40.210 --> 02:30:45.210
<v Speaker 1>watch his 20 poem films for five seconds</v>
<v Speaker 1>each until they found the one that they </v>

3029
02:30:45.210 --> 02:30:50.111
<v Speaker 1>want to jack off too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's much more likely that a former </v>

3030
02:30:50.111 --> 02:30:52.460
<v Speaker 1>porn star will be spotted in outage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence by it,</v>

3031
02:30:52.730 --> 02:30:54.950
<v Speaker 1>like I was talking to this guy called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dale Rutter,</v>

3032
02:30:55.630 --> 02:31:00.630
<v Speaker 1>his name is Dale debone and got a job as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nurse in a hospital and human </v>

3033
02:31:03.621 --> 02:31:08.621
<v Speaker 1>resources code the and said to him a udl</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bone and said,</v>

3034
02:31:09.201 --> 02:31:14.201
<v Speaker 1>we have to fire you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like with any patient says you </v>

3035
02:31:14.201 --> 02:31:15.760
<v Speaker 1>even like looked at the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they went to court.</v>

3036
02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pull out a day offset that his </v>

3037
02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:21.000
<v Speaker 1>recognizability</v>

3038
02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:24.600
<v Speaker 2>has gone up massively since pornhub and </v>
<v Speaker 2>free porn came along.</v>

3039
02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be mad at the people </v>

3040
02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:29.840
<v Speaker 2>recognize him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3041
02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Pervert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3042
02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:29.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm just doing a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fuck.</v>

3043
02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:32.700
<v Speaker 2>There was a woman who got arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not arrested,</v>

3044
02:31:32.701 --> 02:31:35.680
<v Speaker 2>rather fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was a school teacher and uh,</v>

3045
02:31:35.710 --> 02:31:40.710
<v Speaker 2>they turned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned out that in the nineties or </v>

3046
02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:43.221
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd done porn and she was like really </v>

3047
02:31:43.221 --> 02:31:43.221
<v Speaker 2>well respected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

3048
02:31:43.221 --> 02:31:44.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loved school teacher.</v>

3049
02:31:44.221 --> 02:31:47.940
<v Speaker 2>And then one of the kids in school </v>
<v Speaker 2>figured it out,</v>

3050
02:31:48.020 --> 02:31:50.220
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Started telling everybody next thing you</v>

3051
02:31:50.221 --> 02:31:51.600
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids are getting online.</v>

3052
02:31:51.930 --> 02:31:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And watching the teacher and she lost </v>

3053
02:31:56.930 --> 02:31:58.110
<v Speaker 2>her job and she was like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really respected and loved.</v>

3054
02:31:58.470 --> 02:31:59.430
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3055
02:31:59.700 --> 02:32:01.590
<v Speaker 2>we don't love you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to fuck.</v>

3056
02:32:02.420 --> 02:32:02.970
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3057
02:32:02.971 --> 02:32:03.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3058
02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:05.310
<v Speaker 2>it's baffling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3059
02:32:05.311 --> 02:32:09.180
<v Speaker 2>even in these sort of sex positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more sex positive,</v>

3060
02:32:09.181 --> 02:32:12.570
<v Speaker 2>kind of empty slut shaming times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still a massive amount.</v>

3061
02:32:12.720 --> 02:32:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Technically that's not real when it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble,</v>

3062
02:32:16.770 --> 02:32:20.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a small book that most of the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't share the ball.</v>

3063
02:32:20.460 --> 02:32:21.790
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3064
02:32:22.080 --> 02:32:23.400
<v Speaker 2>what about other countries?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3065
02:32:23.401 --> 02:32:26.310
<v Speaker 2>is this stigma attached to the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't there like in Italy,</v>

3066
02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:31.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a former porn star ran for PARLA </v>

3067
02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:33.100
<v Speaker 2>national,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started going out with um,</v>

3068
02:32:33.570 --> 02:32:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck the artist Jeff Koons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who he is.</v>

3069
02:32:37.430 --> 02:32:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like a big,</v>

3070
02:32:38.401 --> 02:32:43.401
<v Speaker 2>like famous sort of pop artists and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think they will have a relationship and </v>

3071
02:32:43.531 --> 02:32:44.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

3072
02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:49.880
<v Speaker 2>she asked you to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain is still that stigma and show </v>

3073
02:32:49.950 --> 02:32:52.770
<v Speaker 2>Italy doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a little wild over there.</v>

3074
02:32:53.490 --> 02:32:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would have,</v>

3075
02:32:54.321 --> 02:32:59.321
<v Speaker 2>I would wonder like what countries are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most accepting of former adult </v>

3076
02:32:59.321 --> 02:33:02.520
<v Speaker 2>stars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adult is my favorite term adult.</v>

3077
02:33:02.980 --> 02:33:03.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3078
02:33:04.100 --> 02:33:06.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like urban land only.</v>

3079
02:33:06.050 --> 02:33:08.070
<v Speaker 2>If you say urban used just say black </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

3080
02:33:08.071 --> 02:33:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adult say porn to say porn.</v>

3081
02:33:12.320 --> 02:33:14.490
<v Speaker 2>And said to the adult industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3082
