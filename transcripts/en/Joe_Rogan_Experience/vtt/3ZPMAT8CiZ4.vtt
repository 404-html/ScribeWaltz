packages.
The postman comes,

14
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:50.190
you've got all this stuff printed from your own home computer,

15
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:54.030
you give it to him and you're done.
You don't have to go to the post office.

16
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.140

You don't have to deal with the nonsense,

17
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.900
the post man.
If you're in a place where the post man can pick it up,

18
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:03.840
you can just leave it out there and give it to him or you know,

19
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.690
you might have to drop it off in a mailbox or a post office,

20
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.190

also a company that's owned by a bunch of cool motherfuckers.

53
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.310
I met them in New York.
The uh,

54
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:18.040
all the people behind the company could not be cooler,

55
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.220

people.

So a squarespace.com and enter in the code word j o e and get yourself a website

57
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:33.130
son.
Isn't it about time?
You Lazy Bitch.
Well,

58
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:36.400
you could do it all on Squarespace before you actually pay for it and figure out

59
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:40.240
what come on and put your time into something productive.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.620
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com that's o.N ,
n.
I.
T.

61
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.440
Speaking of productive,
if you want to prepare yourself properly,

62
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:50.410
incorrectly for the upcoming Zombie apocalypse,

63
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.410
there's no better way than some Zombie kettle bells pitch.

64
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.080
Get Ahold of these Zombie kettle bells.

65
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.380
You can use them to work out while you're watching the walking dead.

66
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.370
That's how our rocket back watching the walking dead.
Those motherfuckers,

67
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.200
I told him I was done,
they dragged me back.
I'm never,
I never got hit dude.

68
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:11.410
Start with season one.
You'll get,
you'll get hip.
I'm about to be on the road.

69
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.320
I probably will.
Yeah,
get it paid off for an iPad or something like that.

70
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.580
That's how it usually you guys how I got on breaking bad seasoned ones.
Continue.

71
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.250
I understand you're doing businessmen.
That's all right.
This is no big.

72
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.920
This business is like that.
This business requires that kind of conversation.

73
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.410
They are so comfortable.
He just jumped right in.

74
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.400
That's what this business requires.
A,
we also have,
uh,
the,

75
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.370
my favorite ones are the primal collection.
The,
um,
the gorilla is my favorite,

76
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.200
so I just love the idea of working out what a gorilla and you can get a c Urias

77
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.600
workout with one 70 pound kettle bell.

78
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.480
That's what I use most of the time for most of the things I do.

79
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.800
That one 70 pound gorilla kettle bell is a mother fucker.
God Damn,

80
00:04:48.801 --> 00:04:50.230
that puts you through a serious workout.

81
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.140
It gives me tired like nothing else except Jujitsu.

82
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.470
Jujitsu is the only thing that wears me out like a brutal kettle bell workout.

83
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.030
Renegade rows with two seventies.
Come on son.
Anyway,

84
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.540
I'm going to get that bitch one,
that little holler.
She's not a bitch.

85
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.760
It's just a tiny little monkey man.
You don't have to be mean.

86
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.270
That one's going to bite your dick off.
She's a nut biter.

87
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.780
The chimp already bit your Dick off.
But the howler monkeys,
a nut biter,

88
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.130
she's right about to clamp down on your favorite ball.
Bang,
look at her.

89
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.000
But if you have never at worked out with Kettlebells,

90
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.160
I really actually would suggest that one and don't feel like a bitch because

91
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:25.480
you're using something that's 18 pounds.

92
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:28.420
You can actually get a really good workout in because a lot of is using your

93
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:32.830
body weight to support these and doing large repetitions.
Please.

94
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.450
If you're going to learn how to do something like this,

95
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.520
get a trainer or at the very least,

96
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.050
start with a really lightweight and watch some instructional videos online and

97
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.420
really watch what you're doing because a,

98
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.300
it's your form is very important to keep yourself from getting hurt.

99
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.820
I've been doing kettle bells for more than a decade.

100
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:51.460
I've never been hurt lifting kettle bells.
That's incredible.
I mean,

101
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:52.690
it's just my personal experience,

102
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:56.770
but if you do it correctly with good form and you don't get crazy and you warm

103
00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:58.700
yourself up correctly,
you know,
uh,

104
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.910
I think it's probably one of the safest ways to lift weights,

105
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.800
but learn how to do it correctly.

106
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:07.820
It's also one of the most beneficial when it comes to your ability to use it in

107
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:11.000
a sport or any kind of physical activity or just for regular shit around the

108
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:12.890
house.
Being able to pick up a couch,
you know,

109
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:14.750
being able to lift things that are heavy.

110
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.830
The the kind of weight lifting strength that you get from kettlebells is a full

111
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:21.200
body strength.
It's one of the,

112
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.520
one of the best exercises for improving athletics because when you're using

113
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:28.910
something that requires you to use your whole body to lift,

114
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.020
then your body gets used to working as a unit as opposed to like the way they

115
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:35.700
used to do it in the old school bodybuilder days where some people still do with

116
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.340
where they isolate,
you know,

117
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:40.700
like today I'm going to do biceps and triceps and tomorrow I'm going to do

118
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.190
calves.
Bitch,
that shit is,
you're going to,

119
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:45.440
you're going to have a bunch of confused muscles that don't know how to work

120
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:48.530
together.
Everybody's strong,
but nobody speaks to each other's language.

121
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.310
You ever see like a really big goofy bodybuilder guy tried to try to fight,

122
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.940
try throws punches of people.
They fall down,
they're all tipsy there.

123
00:06:55.941 --> 00:07:00.140
The whole body's designed fucked up.
It's like there's too much weight up there.

124
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.000
They're seeing one of them try and comb their hair,

125
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.230
clean their ass.
Ah.

126
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.620
Some of them are so big these days that they kind of keep getting bigger.

127
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:16.460
I guess that's how bodybuilding works.
I mean I guess that's what it is,
right?

128
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.360
The biggest guy now it's like who's the biggest freak and those the,

129
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.310
so every year they get bigger and bigger.
Right.

130
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.020
<v 1>Um,
I'm still in the Swartz nigger days of my knowledge.</v>

131
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.280
Nobody building it.
Isn't it funny that that's when they had it right?

132
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.550
That's when they had it right.
Like in sports negative at a ton of shit too.

133
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:37.910
Like he talks about how he did a ton of steroids but he,

134
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:42.911
his physique was incredible and impressive but not excessive in the point that

135
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:44.270
you have today.

136
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.250
You know like today you have these guys that are just 90% steroids.

137
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:50.230
Like you look at their body,

138
00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:53.210
you're just waiting for like steroids DePaul out of their father,

139
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.850
their ankles like them to be standing in a puddle of stuff.

140
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.020
Like pull up a picture.

141
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.040
The dividends between Arnold Schwarzenegger and whoever the newest,

142
00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:03.830
latest Mr Olympia guy is.
Cause they,
they,

143
00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:05.580
these motherfuckers is just getting ridiculous.

144
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.100
It looks like their skin is stretched so thin.
It's just going to like burst.

145
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.790
It does this so unreal.

146
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.200
It's so unreal what they look like now Kona look,

147
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.330
get the black and white ones in him.
Bodybuilding was when he was in his prime.

148
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:22.220
Like look at that.
I mean obviously a fucking huge,
huge man.

149
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.260
I mean the dude has got damn enormous.
That looks almost like a pain shooting.

150
00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:30.260
Dope does not look fake.
We shoot,
it's a painting.
That's a painting.

151
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.120
It's a painting,
right?
It's hard to see in this resolution went.
That's real.

152
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.300
That's lit shit.
What does this click for?
Full resolution.
Oh,

153
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.380
it's one of those stupid websites,
but they do with the,

154
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.010
that's why you never want to get all sports.
And they were famous.

155
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.850
I'm not gonna have a website that's just a scam and they click on it like the

156
00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:53.720
one scroll down.
Scroll down there.
The one,
no,
no,
no.
A little,
little further.

157
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:58.530
Little further.
A little further.
A little farther down.
There's some,

158
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.800
yeah,
like get those ones.

159
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.460
That one right there with him on stage with his arms stretched out with all the

160
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:06.150
people behind him.
Yeah,
there you get a good image.
Okay.

161
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.430
She's Christ.
Okay.

162
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:13.230
But perfect example because holy shit was he fucking enormous,
right?
Yeah,

163
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.490
but not compared to today.
No,
it's not ridiculous,
dude.

164
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:22.090
That big today on the street.
Yeah,
or in the UFC.
Absolutely.

165
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:27.270
Well not really.
I guess sorta like glaze and t bowels pretty fucking big,

166
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:31.260
but not built like that.
I mean that's just one image of Arnold.

167
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:33.150
He was pretty fucking massive.

168
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.830
There's a few guys that are big like Tyron Woodley who's a badass welterweight.

169
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.720
He's real big,
but now I'm like that.
It's a different kind of big,
they're,

170
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.690
they're like,
they're like super athlete big.
This is like a different thing.

171
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:49.140
This is like all this sports in nigger six one or six two I think

172
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:55.470
I met him.
I met him recently at the UFC.
It was cool as fuck.
Oh,

173
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:58.200
you're doing doing an excellent job.
Like thank you.

174
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.930
I didn't get even cited like I'm holding hands with auto.
Fuck.

175
00:10:01.931 --> 00:10:05.930
It's worth the nigger.
I'm like,
this is crazy.
Nobody got no prize when Arno,

176
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.430
so here's the current guy,
I'm a fan.
Here's the current Chi.
Can I count?

177
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:15.140
I guess muscles,
muscles have muscle.
My God,
that guy's fucking ridiculous.

178
00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:18.710
Sleep pig.
It's like there's muscles that don't even exist there.
I'm like,

179
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.360
he's kind of hand muscles.
Lift his hand muscles.

180
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.310
Have you ever seen anybody with hand muscles like that?

181
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.850
It was mostly there's more muscles in his hand and there are in my torso.

182
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.930
Let me just tell you one thing that that guy works hard.
No doubt about it.

183
00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:31.471
Ladies and gentlemen,

184
00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:34.560
that guy does a lot of lifting and does everything scientifically incorrect,

185
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.430
but what's fucked up is you can't even get there without steroids.

186
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.990
You can't get there.
You can't get there.
That doesn't exist.

187
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:45.090
That's not a destination on your navigation system.

188
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.150
His muscles look like they need to be ironed.
It look wrinkled.

189
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.730
The only way you can get that big without the juice you'd have to,

190
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.090
the skin is stretched so much.
That's what those lines are.

191
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:56.050
It's like the skin looks like you could just tear it.

192
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.400
That's the striations of the muscle tissue underneath the skin.

193
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.700
The skin is just so thin because they're credit,
incredibly dehydrated,

194
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.830
not just low on fat,

195
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.070
not just massive amounts of muscle but insanely dehydrated.

196
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.430
That's not possible without a bunch of different factors and that look is

197
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:15.540
extremely unhealthy.

198
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.830
That's really more performance art to me than it is like a sport.
Oh my,

199
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:23.130
I got the eye when I was competing in taekwondo tournament so I got down to four

200
00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:26.010
and a half body weight,
four and a half percent body weight,

201
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.470
body fat by a caliper.

202
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.400
Now I've been told recently that that shit is not very accurate like calipers.

203
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:35.340
Like you really got to get dunked underwater or do electrical thing.

204
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.330
So you know I said four and a half percent and a bunch of people correcting me.

205
00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:42.960
Thank you for correcting me cause I didn't know that the calipers were so bad

206
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.070
but that's what they told me.

207
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:48.630
So like that would probably be like 7% or something like that.
If I was,

208
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.830
I was super,
super lean,

209
00:11:49.831 --> 00:11:54.070
but nothing compared to these guys what these guys are doing.
I

210
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.460
<v 0>was,</v>

211
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.540
I was working out with these guys are doing is like getting real close to death

212
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.750
while keeping giant muscles.
It's fucking madness.

213
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.650
Like this is the nuttiest fucking sport of all time.
Yeah.
It's performance art.

214
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.580
This duck,

215
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.200
I will rip your Dick Clean Ass doors.

216
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.750
Those bank vault ass doors of his,
just

217
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.690
charge our bags on a.com.
Oh and and it,
we don't sell steroids.

218
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.690
We deal cell test Asta t plus a testosterone booster that uh,
we,
we've,

219
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:29.190
we've got some initial test results back that are very positive.
I don't,

220
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.900
I don't want to tell anybody,
you know,
what works or doesn't work.

221
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.930
It gets real tricky when it comes to soft bones,

222
00:12:33.931 --> 00:12:36.880
especially when you're selling them.
But there are some ways to,

223
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:41.260
to boost your testosterone.
There's a bunch of different ingredients that,

224
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:41.501
you know,

225
00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:46.501
nutritional ingredients that have been known and shown in certain studies to,

226
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:51.430
uh,
have a positive effect on testosterone production.
So because of that,

227
00:12:51.431 --> 00:12:55.270
because it's so controversial,
all on him at supplements contain a research page.

228
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.880
So if you go there and you're like,
wait,
wait,
wait,
what is this stuff?
Like,

229
00:12:57.881 --> 00:13:00.340
why does this work?
You can go and research,

230
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.830
you can read the research page and it's referenced.

231
00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:05.410
We have references for all the different supplements we have.

232
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.520
We just recently released a press release on a Alpha brain.

233
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:14.200
We get the first of our clinical results back,
the first that we can report.

234
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.770
And um,
they showed positive results in two different categories in,

235
00:13:18.771 --> 00:13:21.940
in memory and in executive function,

236
00:13:21.941 --> 00:13:24.340
which I f I believe that's the term executive function,

237
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:29.110
which I believe means your ability to do things quicker.
What I've shown,

238
00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:32.320
what I've found myself is that when I take it at form sentences better,

239
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:33.700
I know that sounds like horseshit,

240
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.630
but your mind runs on a foundation of nutrients.
Your,

241
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.110
your mind and your body,
the whole thing,
the whole package together,

242
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.620
the more healthy it is,
the better it runs period.

243
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:48.640
And there's certain aspects of health and nutrition that had been shown to

244
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:50.350
enhance cognitive function,

245
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:55.390
but we did when constructing Alpha brain is we isolated or we got the isolated,

246
00:13:55.430 --> 00:14:00.280
um,
ingredients from the best vendors we can find and all this stuff that's been

247
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:04.570
shown to have a positive benefit of cognitive on cognitive impact.

248
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.860
We also put them together in a way that we think will work synergistically as

249
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:11.920
this is designed by people that really know what the fuck they're doing.

250
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:15.790
And again,
all the research for it is on,
on it.
And listening to me do the,

251
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:18.760
a description of it is never,
never as good.
That's why I like it.

252
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:22.940
Went to Aubrey's here to explain it.
I take it,
I take all the different,

253
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.500
the different shit that we sell in on it.
And if I didn't think it was any good,

254
00:14:26.501 --> 00:14:27.550
I would,
I wouldn't tell it.

255
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.630
I don't think that you should live your life selling people things that don't

256
00:14:31.631 --> 00:14:35.230
work.
But I think that if you do sell things that you use and you,
you,

257
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.820
you find a good product and you find something that's actually beneficial,

258
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.910
sell it to people.
And that's what we do it on it.

259
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.660
And we describe ourselves as a human optimization website.
Go to o,

260
00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:51.661
n n I t use the Codeword Rogan and save 10% off any all supplements.

261
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.630
<v 1>Boom.
Schelok log.
Boom.
My man Everlast is here,</v>

262
00:14:56.631 --> 00:14:59.840
ladies and gentlemen,
Cue fucking music

263
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.160
experience.

264
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.970
I always threatened,
I was threatened to move the fuck out of la,

265
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:14.210
but the problem is I know too many cool motherfuckers that live in la.

266
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.740
I moved down to La.
I still make it work.
Yeah,
but you do,

267
00:15:18.741 --> 00:15:21.470
but you don't mean you could drive here.
It's not far.
I mean,

268
00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:25.610
I don't live here either.
The,
you know,
the thing about living,

269
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.380
we live in the greater la area,
the southern California area is that,
you know,

270
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.400
you and I can exchange text messages.
Hey,
what are you doing man?

271
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:37.970
We doing Tuesday,
let's do it.
What's so Monday?
Boom.
You come in and that's it.

272
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.120
It's on.
It's on.
I mean that's somebody on Twitter was like,

273
00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:42.600
when are you going to be back on?
I was like,
you know what,

274
00:15:42.601 --> 00:15:46.490
show I'm about to leave town.
What's up?
Well you just got back,
right?
He did.

275
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.950
We were on the road for awhile.
Yeah,
I've been back since,
you know,
I've spent,

276
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:49.160
you know,

277
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.880
Christmas with the fam and been home pretty much since little spot date here and

278
00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:56.180
there.
I leave for Australia Saturday.
Australia are there for a couple of weeks.

279
00:15:56.181 --> 00:15:59.960
Uh,
you can find all of them dates on the twitters where you stop and wait.

280
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:02.660
Where are you going first?
Oh you a couple nights in,
uh,

281
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.140
Sydney and then we move on to like Brisbane,
Melbourne,
if you're on the place.

282
00:16:06.141 --> 00:16:07.790
And then we wind up in Sydney again.
You know,
we,

283
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.370
I got a couple of like multiple night gigs in a few towns.

284
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.930
I got to get out there and do stuff and you know,
more Rogan,
you know,

285
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.450
after shocks now.
All that kind of,
I was just telling my boy today,
man.

286
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.300
It was like,
so again,
I know I've said it on here.
Performers.
I never did.

287
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.890
The acoustic thing has like other than going in a radio station and promoting a

288
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:28.340
record,
okay,
we'll come do an acoustic version.
When I started doing it.

289
00:16:28.341 --> 00:16:31.140
Here is when it like you don't went.
This could be an interesting show that,

290
00:16:31.141 --> 00:16:35.300
that'd be an interesting time for me and the audience and it's just,
I've been,

291
00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.460
that's all.
I've been doing it for the last like year and a half.

292
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.890
It's just a different vibe,
you know?
It's a cool vibe.

293
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.490
There's something about acoustic songs too for me,
you know what I mean?

294
00:16:43.491 --> 00:16:45.910
A lot better.
What is it?
You know,
it's a completely,

295
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.720
it's more is not always better.
You know,
more shit in the background.
More drums,

296
00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:53.510
more.
Sometimes a song could be insanely profound,

297
00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:56.200
but just a little bit of guitar and us and a voice,
you know?

298
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.210
And I'm sure you want to produce my next record,
male,
just promote,
dude,

299
00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:02.960
I'll help you on here.
I'd like,
that's a beautiful thought.
Right.

300
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.510
But you know what I mean?
I think that there's a lot,
you know,

301
00:17:05.511 --> 00:17:08.060
like you ever listen to a song and you go,

302
00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:11.270
well they didn't need that electronic bullshit in the background.

303
00:17:11.271 --> 00:17:15.230
The song could have been fine without all that stuff.
Occasionally.
I mean,

304
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:18.920
I don't really listen to a lot of new music anymore unless it gets somewhere

305
00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:20.720
where it pops on my radar.
You know what I mean?

306
00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:22.970
Like I don't dig for like what's new,
what's happening,

307
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:24.290
but mostly what I listen to is old.

308
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.170
So it's harder to look through that old classic stuff and be like,

309
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:28.310
they shouldn't have done that.

310
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.640
Occasionally I'll hear something on the radio and be like,
man,

311
00:17:31.641 --> 00:17:35.180
that's a really good song.
I wish they wouldn't have done this part or something.

312
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:38.320
You know what I mean?
But you know what,
there's some albums that have their,

313
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.810
they're so intricate and there's so much going on,
but yet it's perfect.

314
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.570
Like Zeplin like think of like Zeppelin three things.

315
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.920
Think of like a whole lot of love.
Think of like that song.
Yeah,

316
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.800
<v 0>I mean,
and it really isn't that much going on and know as you think.
I mean,</v>

317
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:56.920
they only had 16 tracks.
They have a whole two minutes of fuck sound.
Oh yeah,

318
00:17:56.921 --> 00:17:59.310
yeah.
Oh,
you mean like going over the top,
which is crazy.

319
00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:03.510
The symbols and the background and they added a bunch of stuff to their music.

320
00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:06.360
But yeah,
I see what you're saying.
As far as the actual song,

321
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.510
they actually did all of that,
don't you know what I mean?

322
00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.950
<v 2>So you know,
so it's good.
And they re they replicated it.</v>

323
00:18:11.951 --> 00:18:15.460
Sometimes I think like cats overproduced their records to the point where they

324
00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:20.230
can't recreate them.
You know,
like,
um,
like I'm a huge Chris Cornell Fan.

325
00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.870
Like,
you know,
Soundgarden and Chris Cornell like,
right.

326
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.290
Like occasionally he would make a record and he'd make it so beautiful with the

327
00:18:26.291 --> 00:18:29.920
voices and all the extra production of singing on top of his voice and

328
00:18:29.921 --> 00:18:32.500
compliment,
you know,
all these,
nobody could sound like him.

329
00:18:32.501 --> 00:18:35.140
So it's like hard for you to go out and emulate your voice.

330
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.670
Got Real production.
You did.
You know what I mean?
I went,
it's raw,
it's fun,

331
00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:40.810
it's amazing.
You know what I mean?

332
00:18:40.811 --> 00:18:45.000
But sometimes like I remember like especially that one,
uh,
uh,
like the land,

333
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.680
this big split Supernova record where like black hole sun,

334
00:18:47.681 --> 00:18:49.510
they were beautiful songs but like live,

335
00:18:49.511 --> 00:18:52.780
it was like you missed a lot of that extra,
um,

336
00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.810
pomp and circumstance of the song,
you know what I mean?

337
00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.110
So it just sometimes I think that that's what,
when you,

338
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.890
and especially I want to make an a record that's like where you,

339
00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.810
when do you stop?
That's really kind of,

340
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.860
and the acoustic stuff eliminates all that.
I wrote the songs acoustically,

341
00:19:08.861 --> 00:19:11.340
so it was just like doing them how you wrote them,
you know?
And,

342
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:15.010
and so there's that line of when you go too far,

343
00:19:15.011 --> 00:19:17.750
it's like that lion and what's that?
There was that movie with Will Smith,

344
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.680
his first movie where the guy had the paintings and stuff and he was,

345
00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:23.290
had this dream about all the kids writing,
making these beautiful,

346
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.170
masterful paintings.
And he asked the teacher,
how do you teach them?

347
00:19:26.171 --> 00:19:29.170
They're all painting Rembrandts and Matisses and this.
And she said,

348
00:19:29.171 --> 00:19:31.240
I just know when to take them away from him.
You know what I mean?

349
00:19:31.241 --> 00:19:33.910
And that's kind of what a producer is in the,

350
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.630
in the music studio is like knowing what's not there sometimes,

351
00:19:37.631 --> 00:19:40.060
but always knowing when to stop,
oh no,
this is done,

352
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.690
that's finished or we need to take some of that away and there it is kind of

353
00:19:43.691 --> 00:19:44.020
thing.

354
00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.270
<v 0>Yeah,
I would think that that would get real tricky man.</v>

355
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.590
I would think that would get real tricky,

356
00:19:47.591 --> 00:19:49.690
especially when there's more than one vision.

357
00:19:49.691 --> 00:19:53.810
Like you got a producer comes in and they have an idea and you have an idea and

358
00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.530
maybe the guitarist has an id and this guy has an idea.

359
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.381
<v 2>Well luckily my,</v>

360
00:19:57.381 --> 00:20:02.030
I'm the only writer and stuff and my stuff most of the time I have cats that

361
00:20:02.031 --> 00:20:04.430
right with me occasionally,
but they're my songs and I'm doing them.

362
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.180
But like for me or producers always been an adversarial relationship.

363
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:12.650
It has to be,
it has to be from me.
I want a producer.
I mean,

364
00:20:12.651 --> 00:20:16.160
cause I didn't have one on the last record because I finally am to the point

365
00:20:16.161 --> 00:20:20.370
where I can challenge myself.
I need,
I always needed that guide where I was,

366
00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:23.060
you know,
ah,
it's good enough.
No it's not.
And,

367
00:20:23.061 --> 00:20:27.020
and now it's like I got to that point where it's like I can tell myself when

368
00:20:27.021 --> 00:20:31.220
it's not good enough and keep going.
Like I'll do the 20 takes instead of five,

369
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.650
I'll do the,
you know what I mean?
I've gotten that Pharma,

370
00:20:33.651 --> 00:20:36.830
but that was always what a producer did for me from when it was started with,

371
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.960
you know,
my first producer,
a guy named bill,
the Al Bashir there.

372
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.840
It was always kind of like that.
It wasn't good enough.

373
00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:44.600
That was the guy they in the room to make you better.
You know what I mean?

374
00:20:44.601 --> 00:20:45.434
And for me,

375
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.180
the only way you probably got that out of me was kind of challenging me or

376
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:52.750
charge me up a little bit.
You know what I mean?
You suck mugs.

377
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.690
Mugs used to be the straight guy.
I get punched in the bus,

378
00:20:55.691 --> 00:20:57.460
stop you while you're doing it.
Punched the button,
be like,
Yo,

379
00:20:57.461 --> 00:21:00.940
that really sucks man.
Do what he can.
And you'd just be like sitting there like,

380
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.420
wow man,
fuck,
all right,
cool.
All right.
You know,

381
00:21:03.421 --> 00:21:04.600
and you shake it off and you do it again.

382
00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:07.510
But it makes for it toughens you up in the studio,

383
00:21:07.511 --> 00:21:09.910
which you need to be in the studio.
You can't be some,
you know,

384
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:13.900
you're the best things always happen when if you get through a whole record and

385
00:21:13.901 --> 00:21:16.930
nobody's challenged your ideas,
you didn't make the best record you can make.

386
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.950
You know what I mean?
It's like if you go and work out and,

387
00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.160
and you don't have that buddy there that pushes you to do those extra two or
can,

388
00:21:23.161 --> 00:21:23.870
you know,
you're not going to,

389
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:27.050
you're going to walk away and you might not have done as many as you could.
Yeah,

390
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.960
I see what you're saying.
What,
I mean,
I think there's a,

391
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:32.240
there's a parallel with comedy too.
I'm sure there is.
Yeah.
It's,

392
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.770
it's the audience though,
is that other guy.
He need that audience.

393
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.590
If the audience is,
and now you could write a bunch of shit and go,
this stuff is,

394
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.400
this is the bomb,
this bit the bomb.

395
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:44.020
I mean you could do that and you can even let you shape it in front of an

396
00:21:44.021 --> 00:21:48.160
audience.
You take it out and you owe them about that part.
It's there,

397
00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:49.900
but it's like,
yeah,
I got to shave the end off of that.

398
00:21:49.901 --> 00:21:51.790
The audience is almost your producer a little bit.

399
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.590
They are a producer because he like you

400
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:54.571
<v 0>go on stage,</v>

401
00:21:54.571 --> 00:21:59.571
like you can go onstage like I've seen you like for the F do a new song that you

402
00:21:59.941 --> 00:22:04.050
just recently did and it's already really great.
It's already there.

403
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.110
That's not possible with comedy.
It's not possible.

404
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.800
There'll be sparks and then they'd be dead spots and then it all needs to be

405
00:22:10.801 --> 00:22:11.550
worked out.

406
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.750
Like every bit I've ever done has at least a dead spot somewhere that I have

407
00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:16.621
chop out.

408
00:22:16.621 --> 00:22:20.520
Like you find these areas where they don't get enough blood like is when he cut

409
00:22:20.521 --> 00:22:24.210
it out and you pull it away and throw it away.
I feel like with music though,

410
00:22:24.211 --> 00:22:28.410
if you could do a way you could,
your music is like more of a,

411
00:22:28.411 --> 00:22:30.720
of a representation of you.

412
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.620
Like it's all like very little.

413
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.890
But comedy has like influence and influence,

414
00:22:37.891 --> 00:22:42.240
not just like of other comics,
but I mean influence of the audience.

415
00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.710
I like knowing that they have a different sense of humor than you or that they

416
00:22:46.711 --> 00:22:50.460
have a different mind.
You need to have to introduce the ideas to them.

417
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.000
It's like a,
it's without them.
Like you cue you really,
it's,

418
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.840
it's a combination of you and them.
It really is.

419
00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.500
You could do a whole song by yourself.
It's like when I hear your songs,

420
00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.230
they're there ever last songs.
You know what I mean?

421
00:23:04.231 --> 00:23:07.380
Like I hear you knowing you as a person,

422
00:23:07.381 --> 00:23:11.910
I hear you through your songs.
That's a fascinating aspect of it,
man.

423
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.370
<v 2>Yeah.
But at the same time,</v>

424
00:23:13.371 --> 00:23:16.030
what you're hoping for when you ranked that song is what I like to call,

425
00:23:16.031 --> 00:23:19.400
what I like to shoot for is that what I call the highest common denominator,

426
00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.200
you know,
and not the lowest common denominator.

427
00:23:21.201 --> 00:23:23.750
Like the thing that we're all going to sit in gear and go like,
God damn man,

428
00:23:23.751 --> 00:23:26.920
me too.
How the fuck did he know that about me?
Had No way did it.

429
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.270
How could it him?
Whoa man,
me too.

430
00:23:29.271 --> 00:23:32.240
That's really what you're going for when you write a song,
write a joke,

431
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.840
your mate,

432
00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.590
they're laughing cause they all have thought that same fucked up thought or for

433
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:38.330
any thought or something too.

434
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.330
And like they just now they're in the club and you're all in together.

435
00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.680
You know what I mean?
And it's the same thing.

436
00:23:42.681 --> 00:23:47.660
It's just I have to do all that and those dead spots,
I have to find them myself.

437
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.230
I don't,

438
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.670
I don't really have the benefit of like going like down the block and there

439
00:23:52.671 --> 00:23:56.870
probably is a place I could do it but it just aesthetically doesn't work quite

440
00:23:56.871 --> 00:23:59.960
the same.
Like here,
let me deliver this song and get some feedback.

441
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.471
It's different.

442
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:03.890
A joke is like about a laugh or an energy in the room right at that moment.

443
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.440
And if you didn't get it,
you're not there and you know a song can,

444
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:11.060
I can build into it and I can know if for me it's can I make myself cry or can I

445
00:24:11.061 --> 00:24:15.920
impress myself with what's going on and do I can I sit through it right.

446
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.410
If I could sit through it cause I got a short attention span man.

447
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.190
I know what I mean.
And if it can keep my attention long enough for then,

448
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:23.450
then it's quality to me.

449
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.030
Well and feedback to is very different for music than it is for common because

450
00:24:27.031 --> 00:24:29.920
it would comedy,
they say it's not funny.
Like that's sort of the,

451
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.700
it's funny or not funny.
But with music it's like you could like,

452
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.870
I could think something is fucking terrible but it's somebody else's favorite

453
00:24:38.871 --> 00:24:41.150
shit ever.
Like to them they're like,

454
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:45.440
oh like hits their soul and I can be like,
Oh fucking Christ.

455
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.950
I guess that exists with comedy too.
But the word,
the way people describe it,

456
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:52.820
it's always funny or not funny.
Like,
oh that wasn't funny.
That wasn't funny.

457
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.400
I thought it was hilarious.
No that wasn't funny.

458
00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.900
But when someone come up to you and describe your shit like to tell you what

459
00:24:59.901 --> 00:25:01.820
they like and don't like about your song,

460
00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:04.490
it's like that's completely a matter of taste.

461
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:07.040
Like you can't even say funny or not funny.

462
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.170
It's totally subjective taste completely so he can't get feedback from anybody

463
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:15.090
else.
Heavy metal guy does.

464
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:18.800
Doesn't want to hear it some fucking Pantera.
June.

465
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.210
Well you need to fucking bang.
I know you could Bang Bang.

466
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.970
The weirdest thing though is man in the audience I have is so bizarre because

467
00:25:28.971 --> 00:25:31.550
that guy will be there.
There will be a guy there.
I can't terra guy,

468
00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:36.200
there'll be a guy there with it.
I there was it last summer I did,

469
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:40.280
you know,
acoustic run of and I did wind up doing a few festivals.

470
00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:45.281
I show up at one and I shit you not Joe Rogan is called Devil's slide or devil

471
00:25:46.401 --> 00:25:50.750
side,
devil side festival.
It is nothing but the hardest.

472
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:54.060
Like [inaudible].

473
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.230
I'm sitting backstage with me and Brian,

474
00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.680
the guy who came with me last time keyboard player and we're like,

475
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:05.450
what the fuck man,
this is what,
why am I here?
I don't even fucking get it,
man.

476
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:08.240
We're like freaking out.
We're like,
oh,
they're going to fucking kill us,
man.

477
00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:10.400
They're going to kill us.
I called my manager,

478
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:13.610
I'm cursing him to high fucking heaven,
Dude.
Like you motherfucker.

479
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.230
You don't even look where you're booking me,
do you?

480
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:18.800
You just see a check number and you take it and you don't even ask where you

481
00:26:18.801 --> 00:26:20.690
just say,
yeah,
we'll do it.
Huh?
I was like,

482
00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.140
listen to where I am and I'm putting the

483
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.920
band after band of it,
man.
I'm,

484
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.070
I'm actually get to the point where it's like I just started embracing that

485
00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:32.720
funniness of it and I told the promoters,
all right,

486
00:26:32.721 --> 00:26:35.030
there's some things missing from my rider.
And they're like,
what?
I'm like,

487
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.410
I need to say Tannic Bible in a bucket,
a goat's blood right now.
I was like,

488
00:26:39.411 --> 00:26:42.710
we need to make a sacrifice for we go out there cause we about to get killed.

489
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.730
And it was the craziest shit and you're pulling it up.
So,
uh,

490
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.840
I fucking,
I tell my boy w and it wasn't Brian Actually,
it was my boy Derek.

491
00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:54.250
We were both playing two guitars.
So,
uh,
we go,

492
00:26:54.251 --> 00:26:55.770
I go and I just tell him when we go out there,
I was like,

493
00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:58.710
first thing to get thrown first,
anything,
we're fucking up,
I'm out of there.

494
00:26:58.711 --> 00:27:01.170
And it fucking,
if someone jumps on stage and just hit him with the guitar,
man,

495
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.090
it's like dead ass.
I'm saying this dead seriously.

496
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.660
Like we're about to get killed,
right.

497
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.210
So this band that went on before us,

498
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:12.120
it was like the bread that gets buttered with bread or something.
It was,

499
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:13.051
that's literally,

500
00:27:13.051 --> 00:27:16.980
it was some crazy name like that on the bread gets buttered or the butter on the

501
00:27:16.981 --> 00:27:21.280
bread or something like that.
And it was the most hardest,
like
crazy.

502
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.920
That ends,
it ends and the lights and,
and this is the middle of the day,

503
00:27:28.921 --> 00:27:33.030
by the way too.
This is like four o'clock,
maybe five o'clock and we're like,

504
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.850
aw man,
Jesus doesn't hide.
Come on.
The whole house clears.

505
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.730
So like all of a sudden I'm having a little bit of hope,
like,
okay,

506
00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:40.860
maybe nobody will just be in here for our set.

507
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.770
Maybe they all just were like that,
no,
we're going to go get a beer.

508
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.820
So they are changing over the set and it comes to our turn and I'm like the

509
00:27:47.821 --> 00:27:52.170
crowd starts coming back in and I'm like man,
this ugly.
Go out there.

510
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:55.380
And we started playing our guitars and next thing I know I see all of these

511
00:27:55.381 --> 00:27:57.990
pants,
Hara and crazy metal dudes and they got chicks with them.

512
00:27:57.991 --> 00:28:02.190
Now there's not a,
there's not a pit,
there's not a pit,
there's not pit.

513
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.740
There's all these views with their broads and they're holding their bras and

514
00:28:04.741 --> 00:28:08.790
their listening and their blood and it goes over like fucking gangbusters.

515
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.600
I was like,
we and we,
we literally got offstage dump.

516
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.030
We didn't say words to each other.
We got in our van,

517
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.400
we didn't even set up merchant this place because we were like,

518
00:28:17.401 --> 00:28:22.401
nobody cares where here we sold like probably a box of merge just out the back

519
00:28:22.441 --> 00:28:22.891
of the van.

520
00:28:22.891 --> 00:28:26.280
What people catching us cause we were just [inaudible] know Derek was sitting in

521
00:28:26.281 --> 00:28:28.530
the back of the van just like,
did that just happen man?
That was,

522
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.990
that was one of the craziest gigs I've ever done in my life.
That's fascinating.

523
00:28:32.991 --> 00:28:36.870
Did they just change gears like that and it was no other thing like that.

524
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.300
It was done.
It was,
it was.
I never,

525
00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:42.090
I was just blown away about how it went and in the way it went over,
I was like,

526
00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:45.720
wow,
dude,
that was crazy.
They really dug it.
That's a cool story.

527
00:28:45.721 --> 00:28:48.360
That must have been a cool experience.
So my audience is crazy.

528
00:28:48.361 --> 00:28:51.240
It'd be an old lady.
There'll be like kids,
there'll be,
you know,

529
00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:55.380
the house of pain,
you know,
a roughneck Hula game.

530
00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:57.810
Guys still hanging on for that to come back.

531
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:02.790
They're all still don't you still do an acoustic version of a jump around?
It's,

532
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:06.630
it's,
if the energy's in the area,
so the audience,
they,

533
00:29:06.631 --> 00:29:09.570
I mean they got it as far right.
They don't have to ask for it.

534
00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:12.570
They have to deserve it.
I you,
you must have loved it when Marcus,
David,

535
00:29:12.571 --> 00:29:15.640
she used to come out to that shit.
Oh yeah.
God Damn Great.

536
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.470
Dana though told me he kind of pushed that into position.

537
00:29:19.471 --> 00:29:22.630
Like not that dude resist it.
I think he had that for,
you know,

538
00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:27.540
he had the two things I the beginning of the uh,
of that movie,
the Boon,
uh,

539
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.030
boondock saints saints.
Yeah.
That was like the intro of his thing and then,

540
00:29:32.031 --> 00:29:35.450
and then like I think that was just his intro and then Dana says you should put

541
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.980
in jumper.
I believe that's either that or in a drunken party mode.
Danny,

542
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.120
Danny took credit for it.
I think it probably was,
I quite honestly

543
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.460
<v 0>think it was Dana because I know he keeps people from changing the songs.</v>

544
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:50.110
Like he wants like Uriah Faber comes out to California love every time,
you know,

545
00:29:50.111 --> 00:29:52.480
and he wants to keep it that way.
Like going back to Cali,

546
00:29:52.481 --> 00:29:56.560
he tried to come to come going back to Cali once with ll cool j and Daniel was

547
00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:57.394
like,
no fucking way.

548
00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.270
You got to go with California law that people expect that it is true.

549
00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:04.350
Like I feel Uriah because I feel like a fighter should be able to change as his

550
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.193
walking music.

551
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:10.150
But when I hear the phone comes out,

552
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.820
yeah,
this is something pretty bad ass about that.

553
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.710
But a guy should be able to just a couple of guys,

554
00:30:14.711 --> 00:30:18.520
like when they let those resilient,
like,
you know,
uh,
like a vandal that,
come on,

555
00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:21.730
dude,
come on dude.
You've got to change up that music.
Quiet music though.

556
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:26.800
I hear you.
But that,
that pride,
that Electronica,
I'm like,
Whoa,
I don't like it.

557
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:27.663
I don't like it.

558
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.680
My favorite [inaudible] used to come out like in dresses and shit and pride.

559
00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.890
W O w well,
there's a guy who used to come out in,

560
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:41.810
in crazy dresses and k one the kickboxer Tude [inaudible] you lost.

561
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:44.830
Maybe that's what I'm thinking do I see awesome tip.
But you didn't come out.

562
00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.030
They say,
Oh,
I know who you're talking about.
You talking about go,
no,
no,
no.
Yeah,

563
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:52.990
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Go on.
Oh yeah.
He used to dress up in a bunch of crazy,

564
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:53.141
well,

565
00:30:53.141 --> 00:30:58.000
there's been a bunch of different guys from Japan that dressed up in wild ways,

566
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.380
tried to try to convince people these tension,
the UFC,
let them do that.

567
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.910
Greatest walking music though,

568
00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:08.590
in my opinion is Matt Hughes Country Board can survive.
That was his song.

569
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.550
Yeah.
I mean this is the perfect song for him.
It's the perfect song.

570
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:17.380
And it was just something about stoic demeanor as he walked towards the cage

571
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:20.320
that that song would come on.
It's a good word.
That's a good one.

572
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.393
That's a good one.

573
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:26.530
But one time I think Randy coture came out to Jimmy Hendrix doing the star

574
00:31:26.531 --> 00:31:30.880
spangled banner.
That might've been the all time greatest.
You know,

575
00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.200
Captain America comes out to Hendrix doing the star spangled banner spangled

576
00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:38.470
banner.
It was one of those,
yeah,
there's been,
um,

577
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:41.470
what would your song be,
Joe,
if you had to choose Christina Aguilar.
Beautiful.

578
00:31:41.471 --> 00:31:45.070
That's what I was gonna come out to if I fought Wesley snipes.
I'm not kidding.

579
00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:49.600
Five Wesley's name.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was going to come out to,
it's Christina Aguilera.

580
00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.670
Remember when he had that,
is it ring at the same time?
Let's I click,

581
00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:56.400
I wouldn't want to come out to some this,

582
00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.360
it was a few years back before he went to jail.
Before he went to jail.
Yeah.

583
00:32:01.361 --> 00:32:04.750
There was um,
this promoter who may be on Wednesday,

584
00:32:04.751 --> 00:32:06.970
we're seeing if we could work on the podcast on Wednesday.

585
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.250
He was the guy who originally started the UFC.

586
00:32:09.251 --> 00:32:11.500
His name's Campbell Mclaren and uh,

587
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:15.550
he is the guy who hired me to do the post fight interviews of the,

588
00:32:15.551 --> 00:32:19.300
like in 1997 when I first started working for them and Campbell called me up one

589
00:32:19.301 --> 00:32:21.350
day and told me that,
uh,
he,
uh,

590
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.120
had a proposition for me and he asked me if I wanted to fight Wesley Snipes on

591
00:32:25.121 --> 00:32:29.410
paper view and uh,
they offered me a crazy amount of money and I said,

592
00:32:29.411 --> 00:32:33.490
fuck yeah.
Or anything.
It was just you were going to fight?
Not at all.

593
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.860
If I could get away with not hurting him,
I would not hurt him.

594
00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.320
I just grab a hold of them,
strangle them.
That was the plan.

595
00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:43.220
The plan was to get the clinch where it was.
Did he have any arts?
He,

596
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.410
yeah,
he's definitely really good at karate.

597
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.810
He's definitely a really good kickboxer.
But as far as I know,

598
00:32:47.811 --> 00:32:50.210
he didn't have any competition experience in his life.

599
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.200
I don't think you ever fought.

600
00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:53.900
Probably could fight and he might've kicked my ass.
Who knows?

601
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:57.920
So it didn't come to fruition.
He needed a lot of money for taxes.

602
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.810
He was in a lot of trouble.
It wasn't,
it was never like when he watched,

603
00:33:01.811 --> 00:33:04.000
he watched a couple youtube videos that you just tap it.

604
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.860
I'm sure that didn't help.

605
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:10.130
Or maybe you rolled with somebody if you've never rolled to some of the,

606
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.870
you try and like back then I was a brown belt.

607
00:33:11.871 --> 00:33:15.860
But the difference between someone who's been doing Jujitsu for 10 years and

608
00:33:15.861 --> 00:33:17.900
someone who just tries it out for the first time,

609
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.300
it feels like such an unsurmountable Shazzam that if he did just start it,

610
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:25.940
he'd be like,
Oh fuck this.
This is ridiculous.
You can't just do it.

611
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:28.130
And this guy's,
I mean,
I've been doing it for 15 years.

612
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:32.690
This guys that I roll with still to this day that just fucking strangle me,

613
00:33:32.691 --> 00:33:35.510
just run right through me.
The rag doll you and you realize,
well,

614
00:33:35.511 --> 00:33:37.820
if I had a fight,
one of these guys,
you're fucked.

615
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.610
Like there's certain guys you're not gonna be able to hold off.

616
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.540
And if you're a guy who's in his forties and you just learn to Jujitsu,

617
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:46.940
I think Wesley was,
that's,
you know,
you don't want to do that.

618
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:49.790
I was talking to you about that earlier.
I was,
I ain't going to lie to myself.

619
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.550
Well,
you know,
kick my ass and new care.
You got a healthy mind.

620
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.240
You've got to have a healthy mind.
People get crazy.

621
00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.770
I can't tell you how many people have tried to convince me that they're

622
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.610
different.
Some dudes that have this,
they have this talk about their mentality.

623
00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.320
You know,
they're talking about their mindset.

624
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:10.880
They want to like mad dog you and tell you how much different there are one
dude,

625
00:34:10.881 --> 00:34:15.200
I talked to this dude for over an hour.
It was in in Belfast,

626
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:20.120
Northern Ireland,
and this motherfucker,
all I understand that he said was,

627
00:34:20.121 --> 00:34:21.170
I'll fight any of mine.

628
00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:26.510
That's the only words I understood how to ever fucking chocolate l I'm afraid I

629
00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:30.770
saw Criteo how to fight any mine.
I'll tell y'all hot,
there's no quit in me.

630
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:35.060
And he was just going on and on and on and it's barely understandable.

631
00:34:35.061 --> 00:34:38.540
Like every three or four words,
you'd be absolutely sure what he said.

632
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:42.570
Every other word was just subject to guesswork.
You,

633
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:45.410
you had to calculate like what could he have meant there?

634
00:34:45.411 --> 00:34:47.790
What the fuck does that?
And then while you're calculating,

635
00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:52.280
he's onto the next time I'm buying any land cause they fucking ass fucking

636
00:34:52.281 --> 00:34:53.900
chocolate.
The other things is they're going to get in front of me.

637
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:56.690
I'll pipe in my hand getting,
I want to take same fucking shake from him.

638
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.550
And they think that they have it all in their head guy.
Dude,

639
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:04.130
they think they got it all in their head,
in their head.

640
00:35:04.131 --> 00:35:07.010
They're just different and their head,
they're just so strong.

641
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:11.630
They're so in that too.
Is that to the,
you don't know,

642
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.110
Chuck Odell would put his fucking knuckles through your soul.

643
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.620
He will literally hit you in a way when he's nice.
He's scary.
Yeah.

644
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:23.080
He's always scary.
You know what I mean?
I've hung out with him many times like,

645
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.310
and just been like,
man,
any man you,
you could,

646
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:29.120
if you wanted to just beat up anybody in this room.

647
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:33.680
I've watched that guy during his prime from like 10 feet away,

648
00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.950
fight the baddest motherfuckers in the UFC.

649
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:40.050
Those were some cause that dude,
like I don't,

650
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.320
I do not think that chocolate dao is the greatest fighter of all time.

651
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:47.190
I think he's one of the all time greats for sure.
But for me,

652
00:35:47.191 --> 00:35:52.050
he was always the most exciting.
No one was more exciting.
Every fight was chaos.

653
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:56.940
Every fight was chuck Ladell waiting forward and just throwing missiles and

654
00:35:56.941 --> 00:35:59.130
sometimes he lost and sometimes he won.

655
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:03.870
But that motherfucker went out on his shield to his very last five buys by

656
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:05.730
sword.
His last fight against rich Franklin,

657
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.190
he got knocked down because he was coming after Frankie because he thought he

658
00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:11.250
had him hurt.
He just couldn't back off.
He couldn't back off.

659
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:16.080
It was just so crazy and so people to hide.
I'm fucking cat.
He's never met me.

660
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.780
Hey,
snap at athletic man May.
He doesn't go.

661
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.810
What I fucking gone through in my life.
I'll tell you what,

662
00:36:21.811 --> 00:36:23.040
how fucking fight anything of mine.

663
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:27.540
I fight anyone any might have met that guy put him in front of me,
but for me,

664
00:36:27.541 --> 00:36:31.680
they want to convince me and I'm like,
okay,
I believe you.
He looking for a shot.

665
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:37.470
He's just drunk and trying to convince me that he's not a victim and all you'd

666
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.010
all he could think of is just like what would happen.

667
00:36:41.011 --> 00:36:43.560
Like if that guy actually did get his fight,
okay,

668
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:47.310
I'm going to give you $1,000 you fight him right now.
I'm not to fight him.

669
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.460
Come through this door.
You open the door.
No one had any idea.

670
00:36:50.461 --> 00:36:53.460
No one told him we're just at a bar.
That would be a great reality.
Show.

671
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.170
A reality show that's connected to a bar and there's a door to the bar that only

672
00:36:58.171 --> 00:37:00.840
opens up from the bar and only I can open it cause I have a key,

673
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.200
a key and I find the drunk is stupid.

674
00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:06.300
It's asshole that wants to talk to me about Oh fucking foot.

675
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:11.270
I'll tell you what bro.
Fucking fucking fuck this fucking cave for the US guys.

676
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:14.810
Want to see this show?
No,
I've been around Mexicans,
man.

677
00:37:14.811 --> 00:37:17.220
No know fucking I know how to kick Mexicans ashes.

678
00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:21.540
And then they go [inaudible] dollars.
Right now you'd fight came,
bless his fuck.

679
00:37:21.541 --> 00:37:25.050
Yeah Bitch.
I ain't scared of no one.
Write it.
Write it down right there.

680
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.320
I'll give you $1,000 right now.
Yo.
Yeah.
Well can we get to fight him?

681
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:32.220
I got $1,000 for you dude,
right now.
Oh there I write that.
Okay.

682
00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:35.220
Come to this door like the guy has no idea.
You open up the door,

683
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:40.340
there's 8,000 people in a smaller arena and Cain Velasquez is sweaty and

684
00:37:40.351 --> 00:37:45.351
bouncing up and down in the middle of the octagon is just stem pushing than

685
00:37:45.841 --> 00:37:50.340
drunk guide.
Towards the cage.
Wa what the Fuck Man,
my own dad said,

686
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:55.470
what's going on here man?
This is a dream,
dude.
Am I dead?
Is this heaven?

687
00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.150
The fuck happened,
Bro.
I want to see that show how to fight any man.

688
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:04.570
I'll find that guy.
It doesn't even have to be 8,000 people.
Cain Velasquez did.

689
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.220
It isn't even about the fight,
right?

690
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.890
The show is about the reaction to that guy seeing the guy he wants to eat was

691
00:38:10.891 --> 00:38:13.120
said he would fight in the room.
Right.

692
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:16.400
Might even be darker if it was just Canaan.
Him,
you're here.
No one's Canaan.

693
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:20.940
Him and cameraman.
That's it.
Yeah.
I just,
thunderous beatings,

694
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:27.720
sundress,
beatings from a guy who never gets tired.
This some shit.

695
00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:29.610
Like I had a war machine on the podcast.

696
00:38:29.611 --> 00:38:33.360
We were talking about genetics and war machine was talking about how like

697
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:38.770
there's a reality of fighting,
like,
like you only can get so good.

698
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.620
You only have like a genetic potential and some dudes have genetic potential,

699
00:38:42.621 --> 00:38:46.660
like to be champions like John Jones or Chris Weidman or what have you.

700
00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.460
They have that genetic potential,

701
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.770
but there's other dudes that just know they're never going to get there.

702
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.690
No matter what they do.
No matter how hard they work,

703
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:55.390
they're never going to get there.
They're never going to get there.

704
00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.750
And if you don't accept that shit,
if you don't figure that shit out,

705
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:00.700
you're going to take some beatings along the way.

706
00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:05.730
And a guy like me or a guy like any pumping normal person like that doesn't have

707
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:07.900
like phenomenal genetics.

708
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.150
You're never going to be able to keep up with that motherfucker.

709
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:15.360
Cain Velasquez has like a triple size hard or some shit and like three times the

710
00:39:15.881 --> 00:39:19.210
size of a normal lung.
Like when you look at the capacity of his endurance,

711
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.690
it's insanity.
It's totally natural.
According to his trainers,

712
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.230
I'm just making up the three times the size is,
he's built normal,

713
00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:29.320
but his capacity for endurance,

714
00:39:29.321 --> 00:39:32.380
like his vo two Max is insane.

715
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.960
It's like a super triathlon,
like one of those,
um,
uh,

716
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:40.360
ultra marathon runners or triathlon iron man guys.

717
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:44.110
Like that's what kind of heartbeat this guy's got as a fucking heavyweight.

718
00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:48.790
So is it 240 pound man,
he just goes,
just goes,

719
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:51.910
runs down.
Everybody like no one can keep up with them.

720
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.480
No one can keep that guy's pace.
Who's he fighting next boy,

721
00:39:55.481 --> 00:40:00.430
he's got soul shoulder surgery coming up or recovery from it coming up.
He's a,

722
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:04.030
he tore it in the,
uh,
somewhere during the junior dos Santos fight.

723
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.150
That's when I talked to like,
Bob Cook is man.
She was like,

724
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:10.540
he could take a month off,
comes back.
He's still at work.
Everybody.
It's like,

725
00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:14.350
it's just,
he just has crazy natural endurance.
There's just some,

726
00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:18.650
some people just have weird advantages over other people.

727
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:23.500
That last fight was almost not fun to watch a little bit.
It was unfun to watch.

728
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:27.890
Yeah.
You know,
and Jr let's say,
you know,

729
00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.480
it's not like shooting in here to tell us that those is a mighty powerful man

730
00:40:31.481 --> 00:40:34.270
himself.
He's a beat to see that get done to him twice.
Yeah.

731
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:39.400
And the same way and you know,
to attribute the first one to rob doe,
you know,

732
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.130
which is the,
is what they call a,

733
00:40:42.131 --> 00:40:44.290
this is a disease that happens when you work out too hard.

734
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:48.580
A lot of crossfit people get robbed on my losis or some shit like that.
Um,

735
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.640
they said that he was diagnosed with that after the fight,

736
00:40:51.641 --> 00:40:55.420
but my take is that that could've just been the fight itself,

737
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.960
trying to keep up with cane.
I mean they tested him after the fight.

738
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.670
I mean that was a fight for his life that he was essentially losing for 25

739
00:41:03.671 --> 00:41:04.900
minutes and he had nothing left.

740
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:08.650
The only thing that saved him in that fight was really the fact that he had one

741
00:41:08.651 --> 00:41:10.180
minute breaks in between each round.

742
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:13.570
Cause Cain didn't need those women at breaks.
He could just keep going.

743
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.960
It just can't keep up with that guy.

744
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.630
They have to got junior listed though is number one.

745
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.150
It's still number one in my opinion.
He's still number one.
It's like,

746
00:41:22.151 --> 00:41:25.750
hey knocks everybody else the fuck out.
Do we want to see that fight again?
I do,

747
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:28.000
I do.
I do.
I want to give it,
I want to give you,

748
00:41:28.001 --> 00:41:32.950
I think junior dos Santos is an undeniable champion.
He's a champion.

749
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.200
You know,
he just,
he might not ever be able to beat Cain Velasquez,

750
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:39.410
but I really feel and guys that are like nice guys,

751
00:41:39.411 --> 00:41:40.760
especially a guy that you look and you're like,

752
00:41:40.761 --> 00:41:43.400
that seems like a really nice guy.
He is very nice.

753
00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:46.100
Like that was life in danger and like you're saying,
it's that,

754
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:49.910
but I agree with you,
but I want to see him try to figure it out.

755
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.650
I want to see them try to figure it out.
Look,

756
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.620
the bottom line is he knocked cane out cold in their first fight.
That's,

757
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.700
that's reality.
He hit him with a haymaker,
caught him,
dropped him,

758
00:41:58.701 --> 00:42:03.320
finished him off.
That was a legit first round.
Tko for junior.
No,

759
00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:06.560
you can't say that.
He couldn't do that again because he can do that again.

760
00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.990
He didn't do that again in that next two fights.

761
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:14.180
But a guy like that because he's got that crazy power and because he's got that

762
00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:16.730
mad mad dog fucking confidence that he has,

763
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.430
he really believes he's the baddest motherfucker on earth and you just got to

764
00:42:19.431 --> 00:42:22.360
put his fist in your team.
That now though,
that's,

765
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:26.180
that's one of the big talking points when they've done a second time was like

766
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:29.420
after you take a beating like that,
it's like going to leave.
Yeah.

767
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:32.180
I don't think he believes it now,
but I think he has another,

768
00:42:32.181 --> 00:42:35.660
a new goal to work towards.
You know,
I don't know if he'll ever beat that guy,

769
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:37.580
but I want to see him try,
man.

770
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:41.000
I want to see him try up until the point where it just looks like,
okay,

771
00:42:41.001 --> 00:42:44.450
we gotta we gotta stop this.
Yeah.
It's crazy.

772
00:42:44.451 --> 00:42:47.060
Crazy town close to being stopped in that fight and kept going.

773
00:42:47.061 --> 00:42:49.250
He figured out a way to keep going.
There's a couple of times,

774
00:42:49.251 --> 00:42:51.650
or herb dean was like,
moving in,
who's moving in?

775
00:42:51.651 --> 00:42:54.080
You could tell he was thinking about stopping it and then he let them go.

776
00:42:55.190 --> 00:43:00.050
Just heart man.
Yup.
Hard.
You couldn't pay me enough.
Well,

777
00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:01.970
you know,
they were trying to set up junior an ouster,

778
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:05.750
but apparently our sir over,
he was hurting,
hurt his rib in his last fight.

779
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.870
That would have been a crazy fight.
I really want to see that.

780
00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:13.460
That would've been good.
Yeah.
Junior is a sure it'll happen.
Yeah.

781
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:17.090
Well hopefully,
you know,
there's a lot of heavyweights,
you know,
that are,

782
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.370
that are coming up now to Travis Browne.

783
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.180
But the thing is the heavyweight division is,

784
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:27.110
it's so hard to get that good,
like,
and to,

785
00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:31.430
to be that good world class in any other organization is almost impossible.

786
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:34.790
Like there's like very little heavyweight competition in Bella towards a few

787
00:43:34.791 --> 00:43:38.520
pretty good guys and other organizations like nonexistent.

788
00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:40.400
But so by the time an African Guy,
I'm,

789
00:43:40.401 --> 00:43:43.690
I just started reading about the UFC is going to have come fighters and you'll

790
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.850
heavyweight,
there's African heavyweight dude,
he's a new guy.
Right.

791
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.120
I just read something the other day about this.

792
00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:50.510
He's supposed to be a bad ass too.

793
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:56.540
They all look like bad asses until they get into the UFC.
You know,

794
00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.200
they were writing about him like he was,
he,
you know,
he might be a legit,
uh,

795
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.880
he could be a man.
He couldn't,
didn't continue.
You know,

796
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:08.900
I would imagine that heavyweights from Africa would probably be pretty fucking

797
00:44:08.901 --> 00:44:09.734
about us.

798
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:15.530
In order for your genes to survive in Africa and be that big or that big of a

799
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:19.400
person,
you're dealing with a pretty spectacular specimen.

800
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:22.790
I forget the name of the dude.
I saw it on one of them.
Not a white guy,
right?

801
00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:27.050
I don't think so.
Cause there's a white guy that's some bad ass heavyweight

802
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:32.160
from Africa.
Yeah.

803
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.420
<v 1>South African champ.
Ron Pots to a six fight contract.
That's a new one.</v>

804
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:40.500
That's a,
maybe that's the one I saw.
He's a white dude,

805
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.560
I believe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a,
he's a white dude.
Pam White,

806
00:44:46.561 --> 00:44:51.330
African South African.
It's different,
right?
The Dutch people basically.

807
00:44:51.331 --> 00:44:55.740
Right.
German,
Dutch,
like d outward.
Is that Dutch?
Yeah,

808
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:59.700
there South Africa.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
And they speak that kind of,

809
00:44:59.701 --> 00:45:01.370
it almost sounds like the Dutch,
right?
Yeah,

810
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:06.090
that Afrikan I think it is like a blend of Dutch and a little German.

811
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:09.780
You got out that beautiful guitar man.
What is that thing called again?

812
00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:14.670
Oh the the company that makes it is Leora Bay.
Their event.

813
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.540
I went up and met the guy cause I had one for years.

814
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:23.390
That was my favorite guitar and went up in us and met the Guy John Paul there a

815
00:45:23.391 --> 00:45:23.701
vein.

816
00:45:23.701 --> 00:45:27.840
It's a total family operation like he builds next is fun to do the bodies and

817
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:30.090
his wife does all the inlay work.

818
00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.600
That inlay work as I spectacular they did is just for me with the shamrocks and

819
00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:37.620
all that.
Is that abalone?
Yeah.
Yeah Dude.

820
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.990
And this Brazilian Rosewood like you can't even get it.

821
00:45:39.991 --> 00:45:42.750
He just had a stockpile of it from years ago.
Like they stopped.

822
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:46.260
It was like illegal to import it after like yeah,
maybe a decade ago.

823
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:49.350
I have accused me of that of that shit.
You can't get it anymore.

824
00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:53.670
Well cues you when most of the time when you get a cue that woulds like 20 years

825
00:45:53.671 --> 00:45:56.070
old,
like a lot of,
if a real good guy like,

826
00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:58.580
like gene ACU or show him one or one of those kinds,

827
00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:00.900
they take their wood and they age it forever.

828
00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.640
You want to make sure that all of the moisture is out of it.

829
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:04.590
Did they do that same kind of thing when they make guitars?

830
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.560
I'm sure cause he just like when I went up and toured his factory,

831
00:46:07.561 --> 00:46:10.110
it's just all wood,
like he has a whole way,
like he was like,

832
00:46:10.111 --> 00:46:12.730
I'm broke because alls I do is whenever I get money I go on,

833
00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:17.740
I buy what it's like the legacy who that like he had a stack of this stuff and

834
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.060
uh,
the original one I had,
it had cracked right here,

835
00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.680
the one I bought when I found it out in the world.
And,
uh,
I'd had,

836
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.400
it was my main guitar for 15 years and it cracked up here and I brought it with

837
00:46:29.401 --> 00:46:32.130
me up there and he was looking at it and he was like,
Oh,
where did you get this?

838
00:46:32.131 --> 00:46:34.410
And I was like,
why is that?
Cause it's Brazilian Rosewood.
He's like,

839
00:46:34.411 --> 00:46:37.350
I didn't make a lot of these.
I'm like,
Whoa,
that's cool.
He was like,
yeah,

840
00:46:37.351 --> 00:46:41.070
I can fix this and all that.
And he's,
he was touring me around his factory.

841
00:46:41.071 --> 00:46:43.920
He got to the wood room and he was telling me about all the different kinds of

842
00:46:43.921 --> 00:46:46.830
woods and he got to the little area where he was like,

843
00:46:46.831 --> 00:46:51.831
I got 20 something sets left of this Brazilian Rosewood.

844
00:46:52.081 --> 00:46:56.630
He's like,
and he named some,
I think some,

845
00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.790
I want to say Brad Paisley or some famous like country musician like that,

846
00:46:59.791 --> 00:47:03.270
that he just made one for.
And I was like,
well,
you know what,
not for nothing.

847
00:47:03.271 --> 00:47:05.880
Not One so old and beat up.
I would love to have another,
you know what I mean?

848
00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:08.850
And He,
and he kind of just said,
let's move on with the tour kind of thing.

849
00:47:08.851 --> 00:47:11.010
And I was like,
oh shit,
he ain't never going to part with that.
Would,

850
00:47:11.011 --> 00:47:11.461
you know what I mean?

851
00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:15.080
That's cause he just got done telling me how rare and hard it is to get,

852
00:47:15.081 --> 00:47:17.210
you can't even get it no more.
I was like,
all right,
it ain't gonna happen.

853
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.340
So he takes us on the tour of the whole place and um,

854
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.160
mind you in like 97 or 98,

855
00:47:23.161 --> 00:47:27.570
I paid like five grand for the original guitar,
like in the market.

856
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:30.950
So you,
I went up there and uh,
you know,
a

857
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:36.070
whole tour ends and I'm once again style.
You know what,
I'm gonna be that guy.

858
00:47:36.071 --> 00:47:38.230
I'm just going to throw it out there one more time.
I'd be like,
Yo,

859
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.600
I really would like to have one of those guitars.
And he's like,

860
00:47:40.601 --> 00:47:42.880
I don't want to scare,
you know,
it's going to cost a lot of money.

861
00:47:42.881 --> 00:47:46.420
So I'm already thinking 25 grand or something like that in my head,
you know?

862
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:51.180
And he told me a price that I was like,
Yo,
can I have to [inaudible] I was like,

863
00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:55.030
and he was like,
I was like,
yeah.
He was like,
it was like,
okay.

864
00:47:55.031 --> 00:47:56.260
He made me two of them.
Yeah.

865
00:47:56.261 --> 00:48:00.400
Got to the Brazilian Rosewood and he made me two more in regular woods that I

866
00:48:00.401 --> 00:48:03.130
could take on the actual road.
Like I won't take this on the road.

867
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.300
The road road Brazilian Rosewood has a very special hit to it.

868
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:08.530
Like for a pool cue,

869
00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:12.700
like the way the construction of the forearm is one of the most important things

870
00:48:12.701 --> 00:48:15.700
about a a pool cue.
And depending upon the wood,

871
00:48:15.701 --> 00:48:16.870
they have a completely different hit.

872
00:48:16.871 --> 00:48:21.310
Like a maple forum will have a way different hit than an ebony forum,
you know.

873
00:48:21.311 --> 00:48:23.230
And my friend Eric who uh,

874
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.870
he has this company called sugar tree cues in his cues.

875
00:48:25.871 --> 00:48:29.680
I just forward you a queue.
Pull the shit up.
Brian,
I just forwarded you this,

876
00:48:29.681 --> 00:48:31.090
this image.
I was crazy.

877
00:48:31.091 --> 00:48:33.610
We were talking about his come just setting up my pool table at the new house

878
00:48:33.611 --> 00:48:36.670
again son.
Whenever you want to get robbed,
I'll come on over and show you.

879
00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:39.190
We'll see if he'll drive that far.

880
00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:43.550
I'll drive or I'll just pull the pool is actually said.
Not only that,

881
00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:46.090
the pool is getting built right now my back yard is because I'm trying to build

882
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:49.360
my backyard because you know what my daughter's situation and whatnot that I

883
00:48:49.361 --> 00:48:51.580
want to have to kind of back yard that all her friends are always going to want

884
00:48:51.581 --> 00:48:54.940
to be at our house.
Oh,
that's cool.
Oh No,
we've got to play over there.

885
00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:58.600
I tried to build that right now.
Yeah,
that's cool man.

886
00:48:58.601 --> 00:48:59.620
I have that kind of situation.

887
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:04.360
He's going to take me a couple months to get my sticks sharp again.
Anyways,
so,

888
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:08.380
but I'll let you back.
I've got a crazy like this art dude,

889
00:49:08.381 --> 00:49:09.820
it was this company called alchemy.

890
00:49:09.821 --> 00:49:13.630
They knew they guy who owned it like I think he got caught out there on drugs or

891
00:49:13.631 --> 00:49:14.920
something.
If I'm wrong,
I'm sorry,

892
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.310
but like they only made like three or four of these pool tables.
It's like,

893
00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:23.440
it's out of steel beams.
Amazing looking like shit.

894
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:27.760
Two good companies.
Well there's a couple that are okay.

895
00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.420
But the real companies for pool tables are diamond and,
and,

896
00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.180
and I'm familiar Brunswick.
Yeah,

897
00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:38.000
they had like all the slates and stuff that would,

898
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:42.900
this is like,
there's some other images that this,
uh,
this guys,
his cues,

899
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.240
you see it's all for him.
While I was going to say it's like they're,

900
00:49:46.241 --> 00:49:51.060
it's about harmonics.
Like he says that the way Acu hits is,

901
00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:53.950
it was probably very similar.
He said,
I don't make instruments,

902
00:49:53.951 --> 00:49:54.820
musical instruments,

903
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.020
but I would imagine that every type of wood has a different sort of harmonic

904
00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:02.950
look at the images,
these woods.
I mean,
this is so fucking beautiful.

905
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:06.340
And he liked those,
those guys that make these guitars.

906
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:08.500
This dude just collects this shit.

907
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:12.730
Like he'll call me up and he'll send me text messages of blocks of wood.

908
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:16.800
Like it's a girl's ass,
you know,
you know,
like you do to send you through.

909
00:50:16.801 --> 00:50:20.390
They're like,
look at his ass.
I saw I'll even,
his sons were like,
Yo man,

910
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.560
they had to pop pops.
That's all he does is go out and buy wood.
Yeah,

911
00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:26.830
look at this would man,
I mean that is fucking artwork.

912
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.860
That would would is nature's art.
I'm going to need one of those.
Beautiful.

913
00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:32.840
That is and we'll make you one.
Yeah,
I'm gonna need one.

914
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:33.940
He's a good friend of mine and he's,

915
00:50:33.941 --> 00:50:38.510
he's a cool motherfucker that that Q is God damn master.
Got to have the boss Q.

916
00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.630
You know what I mean?
Everybody comes up with just the boss Q.

917
00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.360
If you didn't bring your own and get one of those ones off to walled is the boss

918
00:50:44.361 --> 00:50:46.840
Q,
right?
Yeah,
exactly.
Shit,

919
00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:50.160
I got a bunch of those I can store bought Mcdermott's and and all that.
Good.

920
00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:53.180
I know they're good.
Planning Salad.
Mcdonald's.
That was beautiful.
That was like,

921
00:50:53.181 --> 00:50:55.920
all right.
Yeah.
Well that's what it is.
It's much like a guitar.

922
00:50:55.921 --> 00:51:00.020
Like can you buy a guitar like at a guitar store and it'll sound anywhere near

923
00:51:00.021 --> 00:51:02.360
as good as that or is it an original one?

924
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:05.830
I found was in a guitar shop in Nashville.
You know what I mean?
It's just say,

925
00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:06.260
you know what,

926
00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.840
for me it's like guitars or like things that speak to me like when,

927
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:10.970
you know what I mean?
It's weird.
I'm sure there's something in your life.

928
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.220
Everybody hasn't been,
but it's like I walked into the shop that day.

929
00:51:13.221 --> 00:51:14.690
I saw this one and it was the angel.

930
00:51:14.691 --> 00:51:16.580
See I even had them replicate the angel on my,

931
00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:20.840
on my original one because that's what originally I saw this work alone and I

932
00:51:20.841 --> 00:51:24.170
just was like,
you know,
this is beautiful.
Let me play this guitar.
And it just,

933
00:51:24.171 --> 00:51:28.730
the sound of it,
it's just so the wood,
is that what it is?

934
00:51:28.731 --> 00:51:31.580
And I didn't realize it at the time because I didn't know it was Brazilian

935
00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.040
Rosewood,
but it was like always been warmer to me and a little more,

936
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:36.290
had a little more bottom,
had a little more bass in it,

937
00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:40.010
a little more ass than my other guitars.
I have other guitars I love,

938
00:51:40.011 --> 00:51:44.510
but this one had just,
and he replicated it perfectly.

939
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.450
So is it about with them?
Is it about the thickness of the wood,

940
00:51:47.451 --> 00:51:50.650
the age of the wood,
the density,
all those things probably,
you know,

941
00:51:50.651 --> 00:51:54.720
and I didn't get it.
I just asked him to build it and I mean he,

942
00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.100
I'm sure he told me sign it.
But I mean the thickness is all the same.

943
00:51:58.101 --> 00:52:00.890
Pretty much the on this like the sheets of wood where all look pretty much like

944
00:52:00.891 --> 00:52:04.190
they already wear the same amount of thickness,
but it's like,
you know,

945
00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:08.090
it takes a while.
They have to shape,
you know,
this part is like,
you know,

946
00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:10.610
cutting it out on the flat part is easy.
This is actually,

947
00:52:10.611 --> 00:52:12.860
this was a flat piece of wood at one,
you know what I mean?

948
00:52:12.861 --> 00:52:17.390
So they bend it with water,
something,
water and,
and time,
you know,

949
00:52:17.391 --> 00:52:21.720
so it's a slow process.
Like I waited months for these guitars.
It wasn't Yay,

950
00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:24.020
they're done.
It was like,
when they were done,
it was almost like,
oh,

951
00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:27.920
I almost forgot I ordered those.
The same thing with,
with pool cues.

952
00:52:27.921 --> 00:52:28.690
It's like the,

953
00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:32.810
the wood needs a lot of time in order to like to shape it into something.

954
00:52:32.811 --> 00:52:37.370
You can't just shape it.
It'll move and change.
Like you got to do it real slowly.

955
00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.530
But the result is like,

956
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:44.330
there's something about wood that like it's the best for,

957
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.180
for certain things.
I know is the best for pool cues,

958
00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.940
but it seems like for Acoustic Guitars too,
right?

959
00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:53.470
They ever come up with anything that's better.
More clothes.

960
00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:00.020
I'm sure there is,
but I'm also sure it probably sounds like garbage.

961
00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:05.750
I mean the word is that it lives in there.
Its poorest and sound is like,

962
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:08.180
it's like I tell people the difference between like what I tried to do,

963
00:53:08.181 --> 00:53:11.360
like even when I record this isn't,
you know,
for technique,
more technical people,

964
00:53:11.361 --> 00:53:14.510
but like you know,
nowadays everything's done in the box and computers.

965
00:53:14.511 --> 00:53:18.410
You know what I mean?
Like I like 10 I do 90% of what I do in the box.

966
00:53:18.411 --> 00:53:19.340
I like to hit tape.

967
00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:22.280
At some point you'd dump it onto a piece of tape left to take soapbox,

968
00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:25.070
soak up the sound and let it become real.

969
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:30.000
Not some just ones and Zeros let it become like what it is.
Electricity,
you know?

970
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.140
Cause when it's in a computer it's really just ones and Zeros and it to me,

971
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:36.960
I can tell the difference like when you hit the tape,

972
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:39.000
even if you dump it back into the computer now it's,

973
00:53:39.001 --> 00:53:41.850
it's been alive and that's kind of the same thing.
It's like,

974
00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:46.750
I can't explain it,
but this was living materials.
It's porous,

975
00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:48.960
it's got energy still.
You know what I mean?

976
00:53:48.961 --> 00:53:52.530
A piece of carbon fiber doesn't really have any energy.
A piece of plastic.

977
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:54.780
It doesn't have that same cause.

978
00:53:54.781 --> 00:53:59.400
You're not an electric guitar works because you're not counting on this to be

979
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:03.440
making the music when you're counting on the amplifier and,
and,
and your and,

980
00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:07.140
and what you're doing up here is mostly doing the tonal work.

981
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.640
You know what I mean?
When you get an electric guitar,
is it the,

982
00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:16.010
sounds like there's no like hollow opening inside of it.
There's some are,

983
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:19.470
I personally,
when I play electric I play grouches.

984
00:54:19.471 --> 00:54:22.020
Like either white falcons are a country gentleman,

985
00:54:22.021 --> 00:54:24.540
which are hollow bodies because then I can go,

986
00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:29.310
because a lot of my songs blend electric and acoustic.
When I play live,

987
00:54:29.311 --> 00:54:34.210
I can go with a clean tone on a hollow body.
Electric is not acoustic,
but it's,

988
00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:39.150
it's close replication.
Huh.
And then when I go with it,
like you know,

989
00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:41.990
in a distorted tone or something like that through a pedal and you know,

990
00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:47.340
it doesn't matter.
So when you're making sound with an electric guitar,

991
00:54:47.341 --> 00:54:51.210
like a flat,
like you know,
Jimi Hendrix style,
electric guitar,

992
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:55.830
where's the sound?
It's,
it's being processed inside the guitar.

993
00:54:55.831 --> 00:54:59.810
Like it's without being plugged in,
it's not really making much noise.
Right.

994
00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:02.590
It's making a minimal,
you can hear a guitar,
like you can play it,

995
00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.010
it just won't ring out.
It won't have,

996
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:08.540
the amplification in here is coming from the box that's built around,

997
00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:09.780
you know the hole right here.

998
00:55:09.781 --> 00:55:14.280
The wooden box is the amplifier and that's what also keeps that sound

999
00:55:14.281 --> 00:55:18.340
continuing.
The vibration that's strains and it's games revert back.

1000
00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.440
When you examine it keeps going like,
well,
it's still going.

1001
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:27.300
Still going to sound inside the box just doing like this.

1002
00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:29.570
That's something we don't really think about too much.
You know?

1003
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:32.070
He just started taking that just math we don't want to do,
you know what I mean?

1004
00:55:32.071 --> 00:55:34.980
I don't want to do that,
man.
That's real.
That's complicated math.

1005
00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:37.440
When you think about what it is though,
it's,
it's amazing.

1006
00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:41.490
Somebody figured out a way to make beautiful sounds come out of things that are

1007
00:55:41.491 --> 00:55:41.890
complete.

1008
00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:45.300
I'm an almost entirely at a nature up until the point where you plug it in,

1009
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:48.360
but all that other stuff that's inside of it.
Up until then,

1010
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.970
even the strings were uh,

1011
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:53.280
nature in the old days because it would be cat gutter or something,
you know,

1012
00:55:53.281 --> 00:55:58.281
some old intestines of some animal get strung across it and tasty that Shit for

1013
00:55:59.611 --> 00:56:03.540
tennis rackets to right.
It was all cat guy,
right?
Yeah.
Did you know that?

1014
00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:08.330
You know,
it's like cats,
man.
They used to use actual cats.
I believe.

1015
00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:11.110
I used to think these actual cats and or I don't know.

1016
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:15.420
That was always my interpretation of it.
I think that's really what it was.

1017
00:56:15.421 --> 00:56:20.190
Let's pull it up real quick.
Cat Guts strings going to be some gross images.

1018
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:24.070
Yeah,
we get some things on that.
What are we going to make

1019
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:26.260
<v 0>the strings on this thing out of,
right?
Well,</v>

1020
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:30.940
there's lots of dead cats around which hair.
Okay,
look,

1021
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:35.410
it's prepared from the natural fiber found in the walls of animal intestines.

1022
00:56:35.411 --> 00:56:37.900
Usually sheep or goat intestines are used,

1023
00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:41.950
but it's occasionally made from the intestines of cattle,
hogs,
horses,

1024
00:56:41.951 --> 00:56:46.480
mules or donkeys.
Huh?
So cat guy must be cattle gut maybe.

1025
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:50.860
Yes.
Cattle Guy.
Exactly.
It says it's an abbreviation of the word cattle.
Got You.

1026
00:56:50.861 --> 00:56:55.110
Smart motherfucker.
God Damn ever lasts on the ball and common sense too.

1027
00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:57.940
But you'd hit it before ever.
It's that Alpha brain.
That's what

1028
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.750
I should have brought some for you guys.
Every time I leave here,
you're like,

1029
00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.960
I'm going to send you some Alpha brain man.
I'll promise I'll have it.
Wait,

1030
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:10.450
but though,
is that a ringing endorsement when you forget,
every time you tell me,

1031
00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:13.660
check it out for bread.
No,
it's terrible.
It's bad for the brand.

1032
00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:17.260
I get too much shit on my mind.
I'm busting balls.
No,
I really only told me.

1033
00:57:17.261 --> 00:57:20.290
That's why.
I know whatever I said I'll do,
I'll get it to you.
I promise.

1034
00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:21.430
So yeah it is.

1035
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:24.730
But it's definitely cattled got it says alternative and may be derived from the

1036
00:57:24.731 --> 00:57:26.050
folk etymology,

1037
00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:31.510
the word kit meaning fiddle and having some point being confused with the word

1038
00:57:31.511 --> 00:57:35.800
kit for young cat.
Huh.
So there's like an origin of it.

1039
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:37.930
So it was fiddle string at one point in time.

1040
00:57:37.931 --> 00:57:40.090
But that doesn't make any sense cause it's actually made from guts.

1041
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:44.960
Stop being a pussy.
They're talking about guts folks.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1042
00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:47.950
I remember it.
I was always under the impression it was cat.
Good though.

1043
00:57:47.951 --> 00:57:50.800
Like cats.
Well it's funny that people would have an issue with that,

1044
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:55.630
but the reality is,
I mean thinking about,
I mean cows,
no worries.
It's all good.

1045
00:57:55.631 --> 00:57:58.630
Saint no big deal.
What do they not use that?

1046
00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:01.720
What did they use that cal got four if they weren't using it for strings,

1047
00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:02.650
like what are they use it for.

1048
00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:03.840
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1049
00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:07.830
<v 0>I Dunno.
It's probably a waste.
Vegans would not play guitar.</v>

1050
00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:12.090
We could eliminate a lot of the folks things if we just went back to that shit.

1051
00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:15.120
I had a friend who was a Vegan who had to play pool with a leather tip.

1052
00:58:15.121 --> 00:58:17.580
He used to drive him fucking crazy.
There's no alternatives.

1053
00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:21.840
They've never figured out an alternative to leather for the a pool cue for

1054
00:58:21.841 --> 00:58:25.590
breaking the habit breaking.
You can't put English on a ball when you breaking.

1055
00:58:25.591 --> 00:58:28.260
Like when you believe these these like Gee,
10 tips.

1056
00:58:28.261 --> 00:58:31.860
It's like some really hard composite like foot phenolic type plastic thing,

1057
00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:35.790
but for like for an actual plan queue never figured out how to do anything

1058
00:58:35.791 --> 00:58:39.840
better than than natural leather.
I mean

1059
00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:45.540
<v 2>it's weird.
I'm Vegan and all I get it,
you don't eat it,
whatever.
It's like Yo.</v>

1060
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:49.750
So do doesn't own a belt that's made anything or any kind of issue.

1061
00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:51.970
Product Hackathon,
understanding

1062
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:58.440
as are my shoes,
they're made of compassion.
I mean I respect the effort.

1063
00:58:58.441 --> 00:59:00.560
I guess I just,
it's like,
to me it's like,
you know what,

1064
00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:06.280
there's an order.
I believe that as well.
There's an order and there's,

1065
00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:10.210
there's some,
we've talked the hunting talk before,
you know what I mean?

1066
00:59:10.211 --> 00:59:10.871
So it's like,
you know,

1067
00:59:10.871 --> 00:59:13.270
I respect the effort throwing of dude that would stand by it.

1068
00:59:13.271 --> 00:59:16.600
But if he's really all that about it,
you better stop playing pool buddy.

1069
00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:20.310
You better stop.
But when he eventually gave up on the veganism to,
okay,

1070
00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:23.490
I got to meat and fish,
that was the first thing cause I,
I'm might,

1071
00:59:23.491 --> 00:59:26.240
how long behind that was a steak.
It was not that far behind.

1072
00:59:26.590 --> 00:59:31.460
Once you've got that protein and system murder tastes better.
Yeah,

1073
00:59:31.461 --> 00:59:32.660
he,
uh,
sorry.

1074
00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:37.220
But we probably would have beat war and murder and all that.

1075
00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:40.070
A long time ago of murdered each didn't tastes so damn good.

1076
00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:42.290
He was never going to stop playing pool to,
he's a professional.

1077
00:59:42.291 --> 00:59:44.610
So there was a real issue with the Max Eberly's.

1078
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:48.350
His name is a real issue with the tip thing can never find a,
an alternative.

1079
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:52.640
I got them with fish.
He needed any Vegan.
I'm a fan of mine.

1080
00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:56.090
You only Vegan fans that don't have a good sense of humor.

1081
00:59:56.091 --> 00:59:59.600
Who gives a fuck which each,
it'd be nice for you though is the actual vegans.

1082
00:59:59.601 --> 01:00:01.220
I've only known in my life.
I'm most of them.

1083
01:00:01.221 --> 01:00:04.010
Like we'll walk in the room until he preached the Vegan thing to you with a

1084
01:00:04.011 --> 01:00:06.740
cigarette in their hand and maybe like a bag of heroin in their pocket

1085
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:09.500
eating m and m's

1086
01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:12.520
<v 4>talking to you about steak.
It's going to give you a heart attack.
Dude.</v>

1087
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.470
You should friend who was at cal video.
It'll make you happy.
Almost cry.

1088
01:00:17.471 --> 01:00:20.920
It's just as it that Farell song.
No it's,
it's just as good song.

1089
01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:24.100
It's just so catchy and we're talking about this before the podcast.

1090
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.333
Say what it is.

1091
01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:30.130
It's this group of people that are trying to save cows cause when cows are like

1092
01:00:30.131 --> 01:00:32.770
used for like dairy and stuff like that,
they usually,

1093
01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:36.430
when they stopped producing milk,
they,
they are useless.

1094
01:00:36.431 --> 01:00:39.800
So they usually just slaughter them like the old cows.
And so this,

1095
01:00:39.801 --> 01:00:42.920
this group of people that have taken these cows and like,
uh,

1096
01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:48.250
like from donations allowed them to just like Diana field.

1097
01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:48.761
So they get,

1098
01:00:48.761 --> 01:00:52.210
they're releasing these cows that were originally supposed to be all slaughtered

1099
01:00:52.211 --> 01:00:55.630
like a hundred or 200 cows or whatever and instead of slaughtering and they

1100
01:00:55.631 --> 01:00:56.560
decided to let him go.

1101
01:00:56.561 --> 01:01:00.590
So these cows for their whole entire life almost have always been in these like

1102
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:04.540
little cells and just kind of used for,
you know,
pumping milk and shit like that.

1103
01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:06.910
And so they,
when they release some though,

1104
01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:11.860
it's some of that like the most amazing saddest thing you'll ever see because

1105
01:01:11.861 --> 01:01:15.670
they are so happy.
They almost look like dogs being released from a pound.

1106
01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:18.190
And I here,
here's the,

1107
01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.930
I mean they start jumping around.
They're like waiting.

1108
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:28.610
<v 3>We're allowed to walk.
Wow.</v>

1109
01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.550
Wow.
That's so crazy.

1110
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.750
Too Bad.
They're delicious.

1111
01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.810
<v 2>I know.
I was just saying like that was like,
man,</v>

1112
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:53.090
am I going to feel bad after this now?
Yeah.

1113
01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:55.940
I mean where am I going to go right up the street and get me one of them

1114
01:01:55.941 --> 01:02:00.200
delicious.
Five guys burgers.
Oh five guys is so delicious.
They got this.

1115
01:02:00.201 --> 01:02:02.570
Like they,
they're even wiping their faces on the ground cause they're just like,

1116
01:02:02.571 --> 01:02:07.180
what crass.
I will say this though,
man,

1117
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.360
like about as far as the animals and stuff that day,

1118
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.660
keeping an animal like that deal for dairy purposes,
whatever,

1119
01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.610
and then just locking them in a cage for their entire life is,

1120
01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.820
I am not cool with that.
I don't think that's a cool thing.
I don't really,

1121
01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:21.000
I'm not really big on like milk as a product anyways.
You know,

1122
01:02:21.001 --> 01:02:22.290
I eat cheese and all that.
I ain't gonna Front,

1123
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:26.190
but there's better ways to go about that stuff and there's better ways to go

1124
01:02:26.191 --> 01:02:29.340
about even slaughtering animals and,
and eight,
you know,
if you're going to be,

1125
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:31.920
there's responsible ways,
you know,
and I try to,
you know,

1126
01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:36.390
do my best to be aware of where what I'm eating comes from because that is happy

1127
01:02:36.391 --> 01:02:38.490
to see.
I think they should all be treated like that,

1128
01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.530
but they shouldn't have been locked up for 20 years in the first place.

1129
01:02:40.531 --> 01:02:44.300
She could let him out once a month,
once a week.
You know what I mean?
Hey,
you,
hey,

1130
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:47.370
you gave us 40 gallons of milk this week.
There you go.
Run for four hours.

1131
01:02:47.371 --> 01:02:49.460
You know,
and then that's just when we're,

1132
01:02:49.461 --> 01:02:51.750
we're getting a little bit too big for our own britches sometimes.

1133
01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:55.740
That's exactly what it is.
Too Big for the amount of resources that we need to,

1134
01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.280
to sustain us and too big to maintain,
you know,

1135
01:02:59.281 --> 01:03:02.760
some kind of hearts big enough to maintain.

1136
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.550
We'll definitely too,

1137
01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:09.090
we're too focused on money when it comes to those situations where you want milk

1138
01:03:09.091 --> 01:03:11.460
and food and dairy and see why it's so much.

1139
01:03:11.461 --> 01:03:14.250
You're willing to let these animals get stacked in there like that for the rest

1140
01:03:14.251 --> 01:03:15.870
of their lives.
But a farm,

1141
01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:18.540
like we go over someone's farm and they have them just wandering around in a

1142
01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:23.130
field.
It doesn't seem so bad at all.
No.
I have a buddy in Wisconsin as a farm.

1143
01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.360
I mean,
I had like a philosophical argument the other day,
w w with a buddy about,

1144
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:29.970
uh,
they had posted something on one of my pages,

1145
01:03:29.971 --> 01:03:31.860
like Twitter or Facebook or something about like,
you know,

1146
01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:36.210
we've got to stop the killing of dogs and Korea for food.
And I was like,
well,

1147
01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:41.160
you know what?
I find that repulsive.
But in Korea,
they eat dogs.

1148
01:03:41.161 --> 01:03:43.200
I mean,
it's like I'm not being racist or anything here.

1149
01:03:43.201 --> 01:03:47.010
I'm saying there's a tradition of in places where they eat dogs and it's like we

1150
01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:51.750
Coulson Indians find us repulsive for that.
They don't kill cows at all.

1151
01:03:51.751 --> 01:03:54.630
They didn't wander the streets and do whatever they desire in her life because

1152
01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:58.230
that's the highest station in life and on there on some of their belief systems,

1153
01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:02.190
you know what I mean?
So I was like,
you can't kind of do that.
You have to,

1154
01:04:02.191 --> 01:04:05.750
you know,
it's gotta make sense.
It's gotta make sense.
You know what if,
what if,

1155
01:04:05.751 --> 01:04:08.280
what if,
let's keep it real.
I'm a dog lover.

1156
01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:12.600
I would never eat a dog unless the Zombie apocalypse actually came and the

1157
01:04:12.601 --> 01:04:15.030
family was starving and those dogs were the only thing left.

1158
01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:20.370
They would get eaten.
I'm not lying.
But barring that,
I could never deal with it.

1159
01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:24.150
Like killing,
killing a dog and right.
But there's places in the world,
hey,

1160
01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:25.840
that's what they do.
I mean,
I,
I never,

1161
01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:27.390
I would've told you the same thing about kangaroo.

1162
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:30.540
First Time I went to Australia,
I ate kangaroo like a motherfucker,
man.

1163
01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:34.830
So I can't say if you put me in Korea in the right place where it's a normal

1164
01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:38.120
thing and they said,
hey,
try this dog.
Right.

1165
01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.490
I would probably give it a try so I can't sign your petition.

1166
01:04:41.491 --> 01:04:45.450
Do you know what I mean?
I was like,
I can't.
Yeah,
you're saying cruelty.

1167
01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.450
That's a different thing.
I'm 100% with you.

1168
01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.700
Have you seen this thing that's going on with this giraffe?

1169
01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:55.730
I know you are because you post like raw slabs of meat on grills like every

1170
01:04:55.810 --> 01:05:00.420
couple days,
so we're cool.
Oh yeah.
I love animals,
but I love to eat them too.

1171
01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:04.680
Could you get a cow at your house?
Like for fresh milk?
Like wrong?
No.
No.

1172
01:05:04.681 --> 01:05:06.120
You need to agriculture license.

1173
01:05:06.121 --> 01:05:09.380
You need a large parcel of land in order to do it humanely.
That'd be cool.

1174
01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:13.140
You couldn't just have a cow but a,
you might be able to pull off a goat.

1175
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:17.980
But one of the things,
all right,
cheese I love and all this,
but like when my wife

1176
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.150
<v 0>was the one kind of started hitting me,</v>

1177
01:05:19.151 --> 01:05:22.630
this is because I used to joke about using when she was breastfeeding,
you know,

1178
01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:26.710
using some breast milk for like my cereal or something.
And then you know,

1179
01:05:26.711 --> 01:05:28.210
she kind of turned around one day and she said,

1180
01:05:28.211 --> 01:05:31.900
well it would make more sense than milk because who really decided we should be

1181
01:05:31.901 --> 01:05:35.710
drinking off the teat of a cow because it's good for you that the reason why we

1182
01:05:35.711 --> 01:05:39.250
drink,
there's a protein in and out of people to say,
we'll say the opposite.

1183
01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:43.000
You know,
while they're,
well it's not the best thing for you,

1184
01:05:43.001 --> 01:05:47.530
but if it comes between starving and drinking milk and she had drank the milk,

1185
01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.040
it'll care.
We'd gone show.
Yes,
it is nutritious.

1186
01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:53.620
It really is the real problem with people.

1187
01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:58.420
There's a bunch of problems and one of the big ones is the sedentary lifestyle.

1188
01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:02.620
I mean we people that talk about cholesterol and animal fats and proteins and

1189
01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:06.280
how much of this is in your diet and that's in your diet.
All those things.

1190
01:06:06.281 --> 01:06:07.050
There's,
there's,

1191
01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:10.900
there's a certain amount of protein you need and anything more than that,

1192
01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:14.770
it's kind of wasteful and too much cholesterol is bad,
but not enough.

1193
01:06:14.771 --> 01:06:18.460
Cholesterol is bad too and not enough.
Protein is bad too.

1194
01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:22.030
Like one of the big problems with people is we don't fucking use our bodies.

1195
01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:26.200
So when you're,
you're,
you're pumping all this food in there and nothing happens,

1196
01:06:26.201 --> 01:06:29.580
it's just kicking the walls of your fat abdomen,
you know,

1197
01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:31.660
that's one of the main problems that people have.

1198
01:06:31.661 --> 01:06:33.460
It's a sedentary lifestyle issue.

1199
01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:38.650
Then you're also dealing with WHO's making this milk is at a farm with these

1200
01:06:38.651 --> 01:06:43.420
cows are roaming through healthy grass feed fields and you don't even have to

1201
01:06:43.421 --> 01:06:48.421
worry about using any sort of a homogenization process or pasteurization

1202
01:06:48.581 --> 01:06:49.180
process.

1203
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:52.120
You could drink that milk raw because it's fresh coming right off the cow.
Well,

1204
01:06:52.121 --> 01:06:52.954
if you had that,

1205
01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:57.970
you'd probably be way better off and your body would probably digest it better.

1206
01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:02.230
Assuming a bunch of things.
The cows aren't infected,
there's no disease,

1207
01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:02.951
there's no issues.

1208
01:07:02.951 --> 01:07:06.400
Everything's been done correctly as far as maintaining their nutrition.

1209
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:10.030
But if you did that,
I guarantee you if you're eating healthy,
raw milk,

1210
01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.280
people wouldn't have nearly as many health problems.

1211
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:16.870
You're drinking dead stuff that's not supposed to exist in the wild.

1212
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:20.740
It's not just the fact that you're drinking milk that comes from a cow and

1213
01:07:20.741 --> 01:07:24.670
you're a person.
It's also the fact that that thing is dead.
That is this protein,

1214
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.840
calcium.

1215
01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:30.840
I follow you now what y'all then fucking he treated and shooting laser beams

1216
01:07:31.061 --> 01:07:34.100
through it and check.
That's not,
you're never supposed to get milk like that.

1217
01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:37.170
It doesn't exist.
So you just start farting and your,

1218
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:40.240
your stomach starts rumbling and people go,
oh,
he's lactose intolerant.

1219
01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:43.060
You just drinking dead shit.
It's just how hard he is.

1220
01:07:43.061 --> 01:07:46.840
Your sister and then you replace it with like all these probiotics,

1221
01:07:46.841 --> 01:07:48.840
they're trying to sell you an out of took that's live shit.

1222
01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:53.890
The bad shit you just put in your gut and to enhance the environment,

1223
01:07:53.891 --> 01:07:55.450
the neighborhood of your stomach,

1224
01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:59.650
like people don't understand that when you're eating live cultures like yogurt

1225
01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:00.940
is just bacteria,

1226
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.050
but it's important bacteria that acid off was bacteria is a really a strong,

1227
01:08:05.051 --> 01:08:07.480
healthy one,
so if he can get that stuff in your body,

1228
01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:12.020
it will actually help battle against some of the other more aggressive,
Eh,

1229
01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:17.000
negative bacteria and Candida.
It's that whole entire thing on that.
Does that,

1230
01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:20.060
does that,
did you watch the whole thing or do you know all about that?
It's,
well,

1231
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:22.100
it's a long infomercials.
What it is,

1232
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.080
I actually posted it up on Twitter and I didn't realize it was an infomercial to

1233
01:08:25.081 --> 01:08:28.130
the end,
but the facts and that infomercial or accurate,

1234
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:33.430
it's incredible how much money has been spent in sure that people continue to

1235
01:08:33.801 --> 01:08:38.801
use sugar and high fructose corn syrup and how bad that stuff actually is for

1236
01:08:38.961 --> 01:08:39.380
you.

1237
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:44.060
Sugar and corn syrup are fucking terrible for you and they're not just terrible

1238
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:46.790
for you because it's,
it's almost like a toxin.

1239
01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:51.810
It's terrible for you because it feeds the unhealthy bacteria in your gut and it

1240
01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:52.760
encourages that,

1241
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:56.570
that shit to grow and it can cause all sorts of like mental problems and

1242
01:08:56.571 --> 01:09:01.571
emotional problems and we're just not supposed to eat high fructose corn syrup.

1243
01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:03.650
That shit's not even supposed to exist.

1244
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.830
You're supposed to get sugar from a fruit so it was like a peach.

1245
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:11.600
It's delicious and it's sweet and it's natural and your body knows exactly what

1246
01:09:11.601 --> 01:09:15.560
to do with that shit.
But if you get corn syrup in your body,
your body is like,

1247
01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:19.340
what the fuck is this?
How are you getting so much sugar?

1248
01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:24.050
It's such a small package like what the fuck has 19 grams of sugar and a

1249
01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:27.710
tablespoon,
like nothing in nature doesn't even seem possible.

1250
01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:31.490
That info commercial was interesting because it showed how they got aspartame

1251
01:09:31.491 --> 01:09:35.360
passed and that was really scary cause like Rumsfeld was involved and all this

1252
01:09:35.361 --> 01:09:37.430
shit like that.
Totally true.
Totally true.

1253
01:09:37.431 --> 01:09:40.250
Rumsfeld is one of the guys who've got aspartame pass.
It's a fact.

1254
01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:43.100
You can look at it online,
you can follow the documents,

1255
01:09:43.101 --> 01:09:47.330
you can see the work that was done and all the lobbying.
Oh Jesus.
It's fucking,

1256
01:09:47.331 --> 01:09:48.150
they would,
they would take,

1257
01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:51.770
they take mice that got tumors from aspartame and cut out the tumors and just

1258
01:09:51.771 --> 01:09:56.180
say no,
it doesn't have any tumors.
Like they did all this bullshit fucking like,

1259
01:09:56.210 --> 01:10:01.210
like science to just to like pass it is evil white dudes at the top of the

1260
01:10:01.401 --> 01:10:06.170
ladder.
That's my next book.
So I,
I've been freaking out lately because I get,

1261
01:10:06.171 --> 01:10:09.830
I get like five splinters in this Trenta to ice coffee every day and my dad's

1262
01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:13.900
like,
you can't have Splenda anymore.
No more sponge.
Go with this shit man.
Steve.

1263
01:10:13.901 --> 01:10:18.440
Steve.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's great.
It's great.
It's healthy.
It comes from a plant.

1264
01:10:18.441 --> 01:10:21.710
You don't even need a dash of it.
Isn't there like reports of even Stevia being,

1265
01:10:21.711 --> 01:10:24.530
there's like weird science behind it maybe,

1266
01:10:24.531 --> 01:10:28.460
but you got to look into that stuff because some of the reports that you get

1267
01:10:28.461 --> 01:10:29.360
like online,

1268
01:10:29.361 --> 01:10:32.480
especially like some of the reports that they were talking about in that little

1269
01:10:32.481 --> 01:10:37.481
piece on Candida talked about how the sugar lobby had come up with their own.

1270
01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:42.770
Yes.
Like Gavi.
Yeah they,
they,
they went after Gavi like with their own research,

1271
01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:44.930
their own fucking for gazy research.

1272
01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:48.080
Like it's hilarious how much fuckery is involved in our,

1273
01:10:48.081 --> 01:10:51.800
in our nutrition and our health and our start government itself.

1274
01:10:51.801 --> 01:10:55.380
It's all completely corrupt.
And that's just another example of it.
It's just the,

1275
01:10:55.381 --> 01:10:58.340
the reason why there is subsidies for corn,

1276
01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:01.940
it's like everyone's making mad crazy money.
That's why they just,

1277
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:05.630
let's keep this party role went around recently about the subway bread.

1278
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.210
But what about it?
And it had some crazy like

1279
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:14.100
I believe it was like formaldehyde type substance in it to keep it so like,

1280
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.310
<v 2>cause you know,
bread,
the yeast and bread shouldn't rise after like a few days.</v>

1281
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:21.300
So while they freeze their bread and acute of this chemical,

1282
01:11:21.301 --> 01:11:24.540
like there's this thing that was going around.
My wife sent it to me again,

1283
01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:27.750
she's the person always into all of this kind of stuff and it was like about

1284
01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:29.280
this stuff and like how it broke down.

1285
01:11:29.281 --> 01:11:31.740
How like in Europe they don't have any of this stuff in their food.

1286
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.270
They really don't like,

1287
01:11:33.271 --> 01:11:38.271
they have such harder restrictions and regulations on what goes into food over

1288
01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:42.750
there that it's always it.
It didn't dawn on me until the last couple of years.

1289
01:11:42.751 --> 01:11:46.020
Like why would I go there?
I eat in good restaurants.
Where are,

1290
01:11:46.021 --> 01:11:50.400
I don't eat the fast food anymore as little as humanly possible unless I'm

1291
01:11:50.401 --> 01:11:52.990
starving and I'm wearing as I got,
I have a cheeseburger,
you know?

1292
01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:54.180
So I was wondering why man,

1293
01:11:54.181 --> 01:11:56.220
I always feel clean and good when I come back from there.

1294
01:11:56.221 --> 01:11:59.640
Like a little bit different and it's because the food's better man.

1295
01:11:59.641 --> 01:12:01.060
The food's cleaner.
Yeah.

1296
01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:04.300
<v 0>Not a lot of rampant use of antibiotics.
I can America,</v>

1297
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:06.580
not a lot of use of hormones,
but you know,

1298
01:12:06.581 --> 01:12:08.200
apparently the hormones are not an issue.

1299
01:12:08.201 --> 01:12:09.910
Like everybody's worried about hormones in meat.

1300
01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:15.070
They say that there's no evidence whatsoever that the hormones affect human

1301
01:12:15.071 --> 01:12:16.330
beings.
That's what I've read,

1302
01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:21.600
but what they do do is make their cows up to 25% larger or an average of 25%

1303
01:12:22.181 --> 01:12:26.200
larger.
So apparently they don't do it to chicken stock.
You know,

1304
01:12:26.201 --> 01:12:29.380
everybody thinks they do it.
The chickens,
chickens is actually just breathing.

1305
01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:32.710
They figured out a way to selectively breed them until they get the biggest

1306
01:12:32.711 --> 01:12:35.150
breasts and then apparently that's what they said,

1307
01:12:35.151 --> 01:12:36.550
that they don't give chickens hormones,

1308
01:12:36.970 --> 01:12:40.000
but they do give chickens antibiotics if they get sick and they only give the

1309
01:12:40.001 --> 01:12:44.140
cows antibiotics because the cows are actually getting sick from eating corn.

1310
01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:46.870
Apparently cows,
when they eat corn,

1311
01:12:46.871 --> 01:12:49.330
they can really develop like some serious stomach problems.

1312
01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:52.720
That's one of the reasons why they're so marbled is because they're dying.

1313
01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.670
It's like they're just so fat.
They just like,

1314
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:59.050
their body just has no idea what to do with all that corn

1315
01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.600
<v 2>farting.
I'll tell you,</v>

1316
01:13:01.601 --> 01:13:05.860
the closest I get to be in a vegetarian is anytime I drive up to five by that

1317
01:13:05.861 --> 01:13:10.450
and by that one spot,
I know you're talking about the time.
It always is like,
man,

1318
01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:13.690
I know occasionally I eat some meat that comes from here.
I know.

1319
01:13:13.691 --> 01:13:15.220
I knew even if I try not to,

1320
01:13:15.221 --> 01:13:16.990
I know I had a restaurant or something and it's like,

1321
01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:20.110
and sometimes that just that the way they do it there,
you mean I don't,

1322
01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:21.430
I've never even seen it or witnessed it,

1323
01:13:21.431 --> 01:13:24.550
but I've smelt it and I know it's not good what they're doing up there and it

1324
01:13:24.551 --> 01:13:24.971
has the best.

1325
01:13:24.971 --> 01:13:27.970
One of the best steak restaurants is right technique right in the eye.

1326
01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:29.140
So I was like,
Shit.

1327
01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:32.200
Like right when you're going through that little shit area there's like,

1328
01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.290
where's this shit area I have about Bakersfield?
Let's say tap,

1329
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:40.720
tap,
tap,
like around that area.
I don't want to know if it's actually task,

1330
01:13:40.721 --> 01:13:43.380
but it's around that area.
There's a good state Kratz around.

1331
01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:46.700
They know that they're just like going right out back and just fresh.

1332
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:49.630
Don't tell,
you know my order,

1333
01:13:49.631 --> 01:13:52.570
we usually to steakhouses walk up by of fire and slap it in the ass.

1334
01:13:52.571 --> 01:13:57.040
You don't say that at that spot,
man.
They will take that.
Literally.

1335
01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.750
That's the closest I ever get it to

1336
01:13:58.750 --> 01:13:59.630
<v 0>not being a vegetarian,</v>

1337
01:13:59.631 --> 01:14:02.840
but being a Democrat is what I'm driving up that fucking five.

1338
01:14:02.841 --> 01:14:04.220
And I see when I was,
uh,

1339
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:09.200
I was driving up there last time I was headed to San Francisco,
uh,
before,
uh,

1340
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:12.120
before the elections.
It was like right before the,
uh,

1341
01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:16.390
the last election and there was all these crazy Mitt Romney probe Mitt Romney

1342
01:14:16.391 --> 01:14:18.610
signs and it was like,
oh my God,

1343
01:14:18.611 --> 01:14:20.950
you dumb mother fuckers are going to make me vote Democrat.

1344
01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:26.370
This she or you realize like how many people just the knee jerk automatically

1345
01:14:26.471 --> 01:14:30.580
vote conservative people like how fucking dumb some of them are when you see

1346
01:14:30.581 --> 01:14:33.610
their,
their,
their campaign posters like you silly bitches.

1347
01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:35.780
<v 4>You know that Kim Colt,
Mick chemical,</v>

1348
01:14:35.781 --> 01:14:39.650
he was just talking about that since subway.
It's the same chemical used,
uh,

1349
01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:42.140
for uh,
making yoga mats

1350
01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:46.850
<v 2>to what it was stretching.
Like stretchable.
Yeah.
That's fucking hilarious.</v>

1351
01:14:46.851 --> 01:14:51.530
Like rubber.
Yeah.
Oh my God,
we're so gross.
We are.
We're really gross.

1352
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:55.190
I Buy Ezekiel bread.
I don't eat much red anymore.
Worse is,

1353
01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:56.930
that was a mass thing that I,

1354
01:14:56.931 --> 01:15:01.130
I mean it got to me through like social media and met my wife texted me because

1355
01:15:01.131 --> 01:15:03.680
she saw it.
Right.
I'm not shocked.
You know what I mean?
But what,

1356
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:07.400
what's it completely ignored?

1357
01:15:07.401 --> 01:15:10.430
People are still going to go right to subway and eat it and not even care.

1358
01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.270
<v 0>Well,
if you want to have a bunch of kids working for you,</v>

1359
01:15:12.271 --> 01:15:14.100
you've got to make everything real fucking simple.

1360
01:15:14.130 --> 01:15:17.910
You can't have them make their own dough.
Add the flour,
add the eggs.

1361
01:15:17.911 --> 01:15:21.430
They're gonna fuck that up.
You're going to have inconsistent amounts of,

1362
01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.690
but you got to give them the dough already made and tell him the press that,

1363
01:15:24.691 --> 01:15:27.240
press that button,
dummy.
See that?
Yeah,
that,
that's the means.

1364
01:15:27.241 --> 01:15:29.780
It's ready and then you pull it out.
Okay,
Neil,
fuck with it.

1365
01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.730
<v 2>Like my wife told me that subway actually,</v>

1366
01:15:31.731 --> 01:15:33.110
so they're going to take it out and I said yes.

1367
01:15:33.111 --> 01:15:35.870
As soon as they use the stockpile of bread.
They already,

1368
01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.650
as soon as y'all finished the poison we've already made,

1369
01:15:39.651 --> 01:15:43.220
we'll stop making that poison.
How can they say they're gonna take it out now?

1370
01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:44.960
Like you have to stick up for your guns.

1371
01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.940
You know you've been doing something real fucked up for a long time.

1372
01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:51.620
Look at this Yoga Mat.

1373
01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.170
Read this article is showing

1374
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:59.940
<v 4>five other ingredients that need to be removed immediately.</v>

1375
01:15:59.941 --> 01:16:04.050
Like why is this in our food?
One is called El Sistema team,
something like that.

1376
01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:07.770
And it's mostly composed of deck feathers or human hair.

1377
01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:11.490
<v 2>Did Mcdonald's Apple Pie.
It probably makes it delicious.
How come?</v>

1378
01:16:11.491 --> 01:16:12.890
It's so Katie to ducks

1379
01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:15.310
<v 0>breasts but not eat it's hair.
Who gives a fuck?</v>

1380
01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:20.240
<v 4>Silicone dioxide and Wendy's beef Chili,
which is actually pretty much just sand.</v>

1381
01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:26.400
<v 2>It's fucking Sam.
Yeah.
Oh my God.</v>

1382
01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:27.301
<v 4>A dime.</v>

1383
01:16:27.301 --> 01:16:32.301
My thall pulled whatever fuck is in burger king and it's a natural beef flavor.

1384
01:16:33.511 --> 01:16:36.210
That's uh,
yeah.
Anyways,

1385
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:39.180
<v 0>I don't know what the fuck that is.
Yeah,
we're gross man.</v>

1386
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:42.560
What grows if we can make a little extra money,
we'll fucking,

1387
01:16:42.561 --> 01:16:45.230
we'll serve you anything bitch.
Chop that shit up.

1388
01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.420
You know bread's not supposed to last very long.

1389
01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:52.790
<v 2>Like I Fred Day old bread is supposed to go to the homeless.
Exactly right.</v>

1390
01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.510
Disrespect I'm saying,
but that was when I was young.

1391
01:16:54.511 --> 01:16:57.630
It was like the day old donuts in the day.
Old Bread.
That's what gets given away.

1392
01:16:57.631 --> 01:17:00.060
Like you know there's no good anymore.
You can't eat that anymore.

1393
01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:02.500
<v 0>I don't need,
I'm pretty much gluten free.</v>

1394
01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:05.180
I give myself cheat days every now and again,
but I,

1395
01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:09.560
I like to eat a zeal bread and those cheat days like and you can only get it for

1396
01:17:09.561 --> 01:17:12.280
you keep it for a couple days and my wife's always like,
wow,

1397
01:17:12.281 --> 01:17:14.900
this stuff goes bad so quick.
I'm like,
that's because it's good for you.

1398
01:17:15.970 --> 01:17:19.410
<v 1>Tomatoes,
you get it.
Tomato,
they don't last very long man.
Once you pick them,</v>

1399
01:17:19.411 --> 01:17:23.340
you got a few days.
Yeah,
that's what,
that's life.
That's what it's supposed to be.

1400
01:17:23.490 --> 01:17:28.440
This weirdness where a glass of milk can sit in your fucking frigerator for a

1401
01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.750
month and smell the same.
That's crazy.

1402
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:35.070
That's supposed to smell like horrible shit.
Supposed to be sour as fuck a week.

1403
01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:39.810
Yeah.
If you're lucky,
nasty.
If you get that raw milk in three days,

1404
01:17:39.811 --> 01:17:41.690
it's smells like shit cause it's you.

1405
01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:44.160
You supposed to have already eaten and he's supposed to be milking that cow

1406
01:17:44.161 --> 01:17:45.360
every day or it's going to die.

1407
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:51.790
<v 0>That I want you to pull up that video of that guy in the giraffe debate because</v>

1408
01:17:52.291 --> 01:17:56.190
this is a what's going on in Twitter,
right?
I don't know,

1409
01:17:56.191 --> 01:18:01.050
just pull up giraffe killed for lion meat.
Younger is this big,

1410
01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:03.460
big debate man.
Where this,
uh,

1411
01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:07.740
after this we'll let you bang that you were ready to go.

1412
01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:10.720
<v 1>Oh No,
no.
I just,
I get comfortable.
That's over on,</v>

1413
01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:12.380
it's a good way to over children and I always,

1414
01:18:12.381 --> 01:18:16.280
I don't speak into Mike enough either.
This,
um,
no,
you will,
you,
I like talking.

1415
01:18:16.281 --> 01:18:19.010
I love your songs,
but I love talking to you too,
so I get selfish.

1416
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:22.430
I want to keep good dude.
I said,
God,
you know,
it was a rough week.

1417
01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.830
I explained to you.
So I'm cool.
I'm all saying something.

1418
01:18:24.831 --> 01:18:27.870
I'm still trying to figure it out.
I'm,
I'm thinking about it because of our,

1419
01:18:27.871 --> 01:18:32.300
a little talk about sort of experimentation with audiences and stuff and the

1420
01:18:32.301 --> 01:18:36.200
unknown.
I might pull out some songs that are,
that are unknown.
Beautiful.

1421
01:18:36.230 --> 01:18:41.000
Beautiful.
Now this is what's fucked up about this.
They interviewed this dude,

1422
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:44.300
I don't know,
this might not be the best video,
but they interviewed him,

1423
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:49.230
<v 0>the,
the zookeeper.
See if you could find a zookeeper,
uh,</v>

1424
01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:53.250
like interview cause they,

1425
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:57.550
they talked to him about it and they showed a bunch of kids this animal getting

1426
01:18:57.551 --> 01:19:01.090
killed,
not just uh,
getting killed but getting dismembered.

1427
01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:06.460
Apparently they did it all in full view of the school children and then answered

1428
01:19:06.461 --> 01:19:07.294
questions.

1429
01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:12.300
So the school children got to see this animal dissected and butchered and people

1430
01:19:12.731 --> 01:19:16.930
were freaking out that other zoos wanted to take this animal.

1431
01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:21.040
And why didn't they do that?
And the zookeeper was,
is this the animal?

1432
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:24.240
I can't watch that.
Yeah.
They pump one into its,

1433
01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:27.520
its brain and then they're going to,
they're going to dissect it.

1434
01:19:27.521 --> 01:19:30.250
You don't have to show this online because I don't want people to,
that don't,

1435
01:19:30.370 --> 01:19:32.800
wouldn't want to watch it.
If you want to watch it,
you can find it.

1436
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:38.310
The point is they did it as an anatomy lesson and let these kids see this is the

1437
01:19:38.801 --> 01:19:40.840
muscles of an animal.
This is what happens when an animal,

1438
01:19:40.841 --> 01:19:43.600
when you butcher this animal,
and this is what happens when you butcher cows.

1439
01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:47.500
And so the interview where [inaudible] was saying,
you know this American guy,

1440
01:19:47.501 --> 01:19:49.300
of course,
you know like why?
They're like,

1441
01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:53.200
well actually it was a British guy to British guy questioned him and he was

1442
01:19:53.201 --> 01:19:56.590
saying like,
isn't this cruel like what you're doing?
He's like,
well,

1443
01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:58.660
why is it any more cruel to do a do a cow?

1444
01:19:58.810 --> 01:20:01.990
You're feeding predators like these predators,
they eat meat.

1445
01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:06.280
The meat has to come from animals.
You can't feed a tiger like vegetables.

1446
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:08.760
They eat meat.
So if you're going to keep a tiger in the zoo,

1447
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.760
animals have to die to feed this thing like,

1448
01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:14.520
isn't it kind of hypocritical that you concerned about the life of a giraffe but

1449
01:20:14.521 --> 01:20:16.200
not concerned about the life of a cow?

1450
01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:21.180
One has to die in order for this animal to do you quantify?

1451
01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:25.110
Do you put one as more valuable than the other and it was just all emotions from

1452
01:20:25.111 --> 01:20:26.160
this guy and needs.

1453
01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:31.050
It's the non embracing of the food chain that they don't want to admit that in

1454
01:20:31.051 --> 01:20:33.060
order to make leather you have to kill a cow.

1455
01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:38.070
They don't want to admit that if a zebra dies,
you know,
and it gets fed to align.

1456
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:41.610
There really is no different than a cow dying.

1457
01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:45.330
Really no different than killing a giraffe and feeding that to align.

1458
01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:49.710
It's just an animal that has to be sacrificed in order to keep this food chain

1459
01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:52.440
thing going,
you got one or two options.
You either led a Giraffe,

1460
01:20:52.441 --> 01:20:56.220
go inside the cage and just wash your hands of it.
I didn't do anything.

1461
01:20:56.490 --> 01:21:01.490
Or you kill it and do it quickly and humanely and then you feed it to the lion

1462
01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:04.930
because if you're going to keep a fucking lion,
you need some draft meat.

1463
01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:09.000
He needs some cow meat.
It needs some kind of meat,
but these could be,

1464
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:10.800
they didn't want to admit it.
It was weird.

1465
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:14.520
It was weird listening to the disconnect from this reporter who's,

1466
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:17.760
I'm not a big fan of people that become reporters.

1467
01:21:17.761 --> 01:21:19.790
There's not really any reporters anymore,
man.

1468
01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.080
There's opinion takers and opinion givers,
man.

1469
01:21:22.081 --> 01:21:25.500
They're reporting used to be getting a fact and delivering a fact and the

1470
01:21:25.501 --> 01:21:29.730
reasoning and the choosing of what it meant was to the audience that doesn't

1471
01:21:29.731 --> 01:21:30.690
really exist anymore.

1472
01:21:30.710 --> 01:21:33.990
This is also a political aspect to what they're doing because they're owned by a

1473
01:21:33.991 --> 01:21:37.050
corporation that owns political people.
It's that,

1474
01:21:37.051 --> 01:21:40.800
but it's also they want to make sure that they're on the most popular side.

1475
01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:44.760
Like when they're saying things when they're talking about things a lot of times

1476
01:21:44.761 --> 01:21:46.770
is not coming from a rational objective place.

1477
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:50.190
It's coming from a place of representing an opinion that's going to get you the

1478
01:21:50.191 --> 01:21:53.940
most amount of support.
Oh,
Piers Morgan Syndrome.
Yeah,
there's definitely,

1479
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.290
there's definitely some of that.
Right.

1480
01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:00.600
Representing an opinion that you think is going to be the most effective in

1481
01:22:00.601 --> 01:22:03.970
getting you more popular.
More people are going to be on your side.
Yeah.

1482
01:22:04.170 --> 01:22:04.581
And there's,

1483
01:22:04.581 --> 01:22:08.490
there's certain issues like that one where you really shouldn't be saying,
well,

1484
01:22:08.491 --> 01:22:09.270
isn't this,

1485
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:12.300
isn't this horrible than shocking that you did this in front of these children?

1486
01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:16.020
You scarred them for life?
And he's like,
no,
why is it,
why is it bad?

1487
01:22:16.021 --> 01:22:19.440
This is natural.
This is nature.
It's showing these children nature.

1488
01:22:19.441 --> 01:22:22.230
And they had a lot of questions and you get to answer these questions,
like,

1489
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:26.520
are we denying that this takes place?
Like what is the educational value of,

1490
01:22:26.521 --> 01:22:29.120
I don't know,
venting kits from,
the weird thing about it is like,

1491
01:22:29.121 --> 01:22:32.190
and just recently my daughter loves chicken,
you know what I mean?

1492
01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:36.100
And she kind of recently put together that a chicken she sees in a cartoon on a

1493
01:22:36.101 --> 01:22:39.600
show and the chicken she's eating or what's the deal?

1494
01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:42.990
And I had to kind of explain it to her,
like,
chickens,
we eat chickens.

1495
01:22:42.991 --> 01:22:47.390
People eat chickens because that's what they're nutritious for our body.

1496
01:22:47.410 --> 01:22:50.440
It was like a rough discussion.
It was like,
let me go to,

1497
01:22:50.441 --> 01:22:53.100
how do I tell a four year old that uh,
you know,
we're,

1498
01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:56.970
we're eating the chicken on the cartoon.
Right.
That's not the cartoon though.

1499
01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:58.640
That's the thing is that um,

1500
01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:02.910
this idea that we have of anthropomorphizing animals,

1501
01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:05.560
I think that's the expression with the use where you make an animal like a

1502
01:23:05.561 --> 01:23:10.561
person like Donald Duck or daffy duck or whatever the fuck it is that's talking.

1503
01:23:10.691 --> 01:23:15.130
And Elmer,
Elmer phone was actually a human right.
Bugs bunny,
all that shit.

1504
01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:15.791
It's like you're,

1505
01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:19.450
you're putting like human characteristics into an animal that we've been killing

1506
01:23:19.451 --> 01:23:20.620
and eating forever.
You're,

1507
01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:22.810
you're twisting up nature and when you're a little kid,

1508
01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:27.970
that shit is confusing as fuck.
Yeah.
Now my kids have chickens.
We have chickens,

1509
01:23:27.971 --> 01:23:31.210
we have 12 chickens.
Uh,
we just ordered more.
We're going to have more.

1510
01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:35.650
We have not,
we have 13 we had 14 and one of them I think a hawk.
Got It.

1511
01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:38.800
You think pretty sure as a hawk.
How'd he chase?
I don't know.

1512
01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:42.550
It might've been my dog,
but I think it was a hawk because there's no feathers.

1513
01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:45.790
It's hard to tell something happened anyway.
We still got 13 tickets.

1514
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:47.830
My daughters know these chickens,

1515
01:23:47.831 --> 01:23:51.670
but they also eat chicken and so I have to explain to them,
you know,

1516
01:23:51.671 --> 01:23:55.020
like I don't have to explain to one of them because the fucking chicken bitter

1517
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:57.010
in the face.
She'll kill that fucking chicken herself.

1518
01:23:57.190 --> 01:23:59.990
Chickens or stupid as shit man.
They will peck at your feet.
They'll peck

1519
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:01.860
<v 4>got attacked as a kid,
as a chicken.</v>

1520
01:24:01.861 --> 01:24:03.720
That's how I got this scar in between my notes.
Oh,

1521
01:24:03.721 --> 01:24:05.190
chicken attack to you as a kid.

1522
01:24:05.191 --> 01:24:08.160
I was near a chicken nest and I've said it before in a podcast a long time ago.

1523
01:24:08.161 --> 01:24:09.500
But uh,
like I,

1524
01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:13.510
my mom wasn't watching me and all these chickens just jumped on me and just

1525
01:24:13.511 --> 01:24:16.890
start pecking me.
I remember just freaking out,
like fucking suck.

1526
01:24:16.891 --> 01:24:21.090
And I had like shit all over my face from pecs blood.
Yeah,
right here.

1527
01:24:21.091 --> 01:24:24.420
I mean he left out the part where his mom's sprinkled seed all over again.

1528
01:24:24.450 --> 01:24:28.680
[inaudible] I was supposed to be for the pigs.

1529
01:24:30.570 --> 01:24:31.770
I got attacked by a goat

1530
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:35.640
<v 0>little kid.
My Dad had a,
a um,
a Co op,</v>

1531
01:24:35.690 --> 01:24:40.260
he was going to school and in San Francisco and they had set up as a farm co op

1532
01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:43.460
and they had a farm animals and they grew fruits and vegetables and everybody

1533
01:24:43.461 --> 01:24:45.230
would come by and they would,
you know,
the collect them.

1534
01:24:45.231 --> 01:24:48.290
It was in a school that they were doing this and he brought me with them and

1535
01:24:48.291 --> 01:24:51.200
this is fucking goat attacked me man.
And I was like,

1536
01:24:51.230 --> 01:24:55.550
I guess seven and the goats slammed into me but it in my chest and I'm trying to

1537
01:24:55.551 --> 01:24:59.110
hang on to this thing and to this day I will fuck up and go to,

1538
01:24:59.120 --> 01:24:59.953
we talk some shit.

1539
01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:03.440
I never forget that there's a lot of animals that it would take some shit from.

1540
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:06.590
I would never take some shit from a goat if I thought that a goat was getting

1541
01:25:06.591 --> 01:25:11.120
crazy,
I would kick a goat right in the fucking face.
Fullback.
I don't like them.

1542
01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:14.730
How am go to at all to this day?
Because when I was six,
I could enter a seven.

1543
01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:17.180
I couldn't do a God damn thing about it and I never like,

1544
01:25:17.181 --> 01:25:20.450
he had to come and save me from this goat and if he wasn't near me,

1545
01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:22.220
I probably would've got really fucked up.

1546
01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:25.430
The female got involved too because I was petting the female.

1547
01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:27.200
The male came over and headbutted me,

1548
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:31.850
but once the male jumped in in the female jumped into,
so,
oh,
I'd like to go back.

1549
01:25:31.851 --> 01:25:34.070
If goats lived to be like 40 years,

1550
01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:37.590
I would go back and beat the fuck out of that.
How old do they live with me?

1551
01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:38.683
I don't know.

1552
01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:43.800
<v 4>Let's go have goat tonight,
dude.
Eat that.</v>

1553
01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:49.020
<v 0>Ooh,
that'd be a old nasty dry shoe goat.
She got a miniature pony.</v>

1554
01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:52.920
A miniature pony.
They're cute.
Yeah.
And your kids would love that.

1555
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:55.410
I don't think there are too bright either though.
Yeah,
I'm sure.
Well,

1556
01:25:55.411 --> 01:25:58.170
horses are weird,
man.
Like any animal that just stands there.

1557
01:25:58.171 --> 01:26:01.640
Like people say they love their horses and I totally get that.
I got,
I,

1558
01:26:01.650 --> 01:26:06.410
I've seen people,
I have friends that they like Callan,
his kid is in the horses,

1559
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:09.440
like Talon.
Like he,
he's written horses to his wife,
rides horses.

1560
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:14.030
They just sit there and they stand and they just wait for you.

1561
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:17.900
Like they don't do much.
They eat grass and they said they can't be that smart.

1562
01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:19.340
There's just no way that that's mine.

1563
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:20.930
<v 1>And well that's a regular horse.</v>

1564
01:26:20.931 --> 01:26:24.680
He's telling a mini or when he brought it down to being like this big,

1565
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.980
I mean I can't imagine it's retained much.
Got ponies.

1566
01:26:28.050 --> 01:26:30.270
<v 0>Well you know that was the thing about this,
this giraffe,</v>

1567
01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:32.730
one of the reasons why they had to kill this giraffe was there's too much

1568
01:26:32.731 --> 01:26:33.564
inbreeding.

1569
01:26:33.570 --> 01:26:36.720
There's too much of the same genetics being passed around inside the zoo.

1570
01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:42.020
And I guess people offer to take care of the Giraffe,
but the a,

1571
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:46.290
that's a miniature polling.
All my goodness.
That is adorable.
Look at that thing.

1572
01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.190
Is that a baby one?

1573
01:26:49.190 --> 01:26:53.060
<v 1>I haven't been Burbank.
There's a lot of them in Burbank.
Everyone had like,</v>

1574
01:26:53.290 --> 01:26:55.230
like walks him around like a dog.
Yeah.

1575
01:26:55.231 --> 01:26:56.730
That might be the cuter Shit I've ever seen.

1576
01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:59.250
And you could get them grow and grow it out and you know,
like kill it bites you.

1577
01:26:59.251 --> 01:27:00.084
And kicks you in the night.

1578
01:27:01.090 --> 01:27:06.090
Then I fucking archery practice in my backyard was horse tastes like I've had a

1579
01:27:06.601 --> 01:27:07.434
horse before.

1580
01:27:08.130 --> 01:27:12.270
I had a horse with a Dunkin and I had horse with Ari wants at the same place.

1581
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:17.310
It's delicious.
Uh,
this is a place called Joe beef in Montreal.

1582
01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:19.440
If you are ever in Montreal

1583
01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:21.460
<v 0>and it's a small place,</v>

1584
01:27:21.730 --> 01:27:26.710
it is the most Jammin restaurant in the history of mankind.
God country.
Ah Damn.

1585
01:27:26.711 --> 01:27:29.500
That place is good.
And the dudes who run it are coolest.

1586
01:27:29.501 --> 01:27:34.480
Fuck these big ass bad motherfuckers from Montreal that are just,
well,

1587
01:27:34.481 --> 01:27:35.260
what is this Brian?

1588
01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:38.890
<v 1>This isn't many horses like orgasm.
No,
no,
no,
no.</v>

1589
01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:41.730
Girls Get orgasms off horse.
They all just

1590
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:49.690
turn this off.
It's not safe for work.
Was there a boundary,

1591
01:27:49.691 --> 01:27:54.610
a porn scene on that poor horse might kill your Dick for a week if you watched

1592
01:27:54.611 --> 01:27:58.750
it
now,
right?
Yeah,
whatever it was.
Get

1593
01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:05.290
she's leading her off to a mess.
Come follow me.

1594
01:28:05.291 --> 01:28:07.600
Let's work out all the problems we've developed in childhood.

1595
01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:11.410
It who's ass all the bread?
A horse down to some little fucking helpless thing.

1596
01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:14.200
God damn horses down there walk.
Well,

1597
01:28:14.201 --> 01:28:17.110
you could write ride the ones in Burbank.

1598
01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:21.000
They look like my little ponies and like these little kids right on in there.

1599
01:28:21.010 --> 01:28:24.410
They're just like princesses riding around Burbank or that girl is getting

1600
01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.990
kicked in the face.
This is what I predict.
I predict that horse

1601
01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:30.190
<v 0>boxer and then one to the mug bitch</v>

1602
01:28:31.930 --> 01:28:36.670
that has a weird animal man.
It's almost like a dog pig thing.

1603
01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:41.650
It doesn't really even look like a horse.
We're weird man.
You know what?

1604
01:28:41.770 --> 01:28:45.050
You can't domesticate zebras.
Yeah.

1605
01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:49.850
<v 1>Tried and tried and tried.
CanNot ride a fucking zebra.</v>

1606
01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:54.860
Zebras are not having it.
He can't go.
Nah,

1607
01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:58.950
I haven't even seen anybody try that.
We can't do it then I'd have it.

1608
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.100
They're not hearing it.
Have you ever met a black guy that has

1609
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:05.850
<v 0>a Boston accent?
Yes.
Many.
So they exist.
Oh yeah.
Fuck yeah,</v>

1610
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:09.570
but they have a little black to it too.
What's it sound like?
I wouldn't want to,

1611
01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:12.930
you'd have to,
we should get a John Doomsday Howard on the podcast.

1612
01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:18.000
He's a MMA fighter out of Boston.
He's from,
I think he's from Dorchester.
Yeah,

1613
01:29:18.001 --> 01:29:20.360
they have a,
they say certain things,
uh,

1614
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:24.470
but they don't have that had the Boston accent.
That is the,
the,

1615
01:29:24.471 --> 01:29:29.330
the White Irish Boston accent.
There's Italian Boston accent.
He's got to,

1616
01:29:29.331 --> 01:29:30.840
you know,
there's a little bit of like,

1617
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:34.830
there's a little more slipperiness to the Italian Boston accent and then
there's,

1618
01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:37.110
I couldn't do the black impression.
I would need to like,

1619
01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:40.680
I don't want to be disrespectful and do some stereotypical black shit and then

1620
01:29:40.681 --> 01:29:43.590
try to throw some Boston talked to him.
I just want to hear it.
It sounds amazing.

1621
01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:46.680
[inaudible]
Unicorn.
It definitely exists.
No,
it's not a unicorn.

1622
01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:48.660
I remember the first time,
like I left America and went,

1623
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:52.480
I went to London and like black people we're talking with English accents.

1624
01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:56.520
Kind of messed my mind up a little bit.
Just,
it just was so strange.

1625
01:29:56.521 --> 01:30:00.300
Do you remember Frank Bruno?
Frank Bruno.
The fighter?
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

1626
01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:04.950
Frank Bruno was like one of the most famous English heavyweights in America at

1627
01:30:04.951 --> 01:30:08.010
least.
And for sure he was fighting against Mike Tyson.

1628
01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.920
You want to talk about a dude who looked like he could never lose?

1629
01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:12.870
Pull up a picture of Frank Bruno.

1630
01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:17.310
Frank Bruno might've had the best physique in the history of the heavyweight

1631
01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:21.450
division.
Even better physique than Evander Holyfield.
I know that sounds crazy,

1632
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:24.240
but the dude was just sculpted.

1633
01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:28.920
He really looked more like a bodybuilder than anything.
And Mike Tyson,

1634
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:32.490
he fought Mike Tyson when Mike Tyson was Mike Tyson and Mike Tyson.

1635
01:30:32.491 --> 01:30:33.660
Mike Tyson was,
it went.

1636
01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:36.810
It went about the way everything went for people that fought.
Mike.
See,

1637
01:30:36.811 --> 01:30:39.900
if you get a,
there's a picture of his body where you'd get a better look at it.

1638
01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:43.410
He,
he be Tyson.
Beat the fuck out of him,

1639
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:47.970
but he was just a fucking Goliath.
Dot Guides.
Perfect Physique.

1640
01:30:48.630 --> 01:30:51.120
Frank Brown.
Oh Man.
This is a picture of him right there.

1641
01:30:51.210 --> 01:30:54.690
There's one and there's one above it with Tyson knocking him through the ropes.

1642
01:30:54.691 --> 01:30:57.840
We could see right there.
We could see how built the motherfucker is.

1643
01:30:58.410 --> 01:31:02.040
The dude was just sculpted.
Huge,
broad shoulders.

1644
01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.540
But he fought Mike Tyson when he was evil.
Mike Tyson,
is this right?

1645
01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:07.250
This guy still around?
I haven't seen this guy.

1646
01:31:08.010 --> 01:31:11.370
I think he got a TV show from awhile back past the wall.
He was a judge.

1647
01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.590
He had a TV show after he does his show right now.
Judge,
Judge Mills.
No,

1648
01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:19.770
he was a real judge and then he became famous from doing boxing matches and then

1649
01:31:19.771 --> 01:31:22.170
he had like judgmental Wayne.
Yeah.

1650
01:31:22.290 --> 01:31:25.710
It was like one of those judge Judy show judge how much money I was his thing.

1651
01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:30.740
Judge fucking Judy Manx online more than anyone in the world like judge Judy

1652
01:31:31.141 --> 01:31:34.200
will buy and sell everyone in this room a billion times over.

1653
01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:39.120
That is rich as fuck on lots of millions.
Many millions upon millions.

1654
01:31:39.230 --> 01:31:41.820
Yeah,
like insane amounts of money.

1655
01:31:41.821 --> 01:31:43.950
Like she makes some mills lane was still around though.

1656
01:31:43.951 --> 01:31:47.790
He'd be doing UFC fights trust.
I bet he would.
While he's kind of older,

1657
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:51.180
you don't want to get tackled when you get that old.
I got a certain age.

1658
01:31:51.181 --> 01:31:55.110
It's dangerous to be a referee because fighters not trying to hurt you,

1659
01:31:55.170 --> 01:31:58.740
but when you have to stop a fight,
shit happens for sure.
You know,

1660
01:31:58.741 --> 01:32:02.260
you're in the middle of a guy who's Landon haymakers trying to get a title shot

1661
01:32:02.261 --> 01:32:05.620
or defend his title or win a title and you've got to somehow or another get that

1662
01:32:05.621 --> 01:32:08.830
kind of stop and get in between them.
Especially if he can't see you.

1663
01:32:08.831 --> 01:32:12.220
If you're coming from behind him,
old dudes can't do it.
It's,

1664
01:32:12.221 --> 01:32:15.510
there's a lot of debate about women doing it.
Is the debate about women doing,

1665
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:19.600
I think there's,
there's definitely women that are good at it.
Um,
but uh,
there's,

1666
01:32:19.630 --> 01:32:22.840
there's a,
a lot of a women that are MMA,

1667
01:32:22.841 --> 01:32:26.440
a referees one that I can think of in particular that I'll be kind and not bring

1668
01:32:26.441 --> 01:32:30.560
up 47 million per year.
Damn bed.

1669
01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.200
Um,
but you know,
she'll,

1670
01:32:35.201 --> 01:32:38.710
she'll have to referee a fight with a dude's are like light heavyweight men.

1671
01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:41.830
Does that just syndication money?
Is that what that is?
I don't know man.

1672
01:32:41.831 --> 01:32:46.270
It's a good question.
$47 million,
man.
She owns it.
She owns the show.

1673
01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:47.770
That's what I'm saying.
So she's getting that.

1674
01:32:47.771 --> 01:32:49.290
She's getting the commercial monies.

1675
01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:54.720
<v 4>What's an act you get to show gets 200 million in ad revenue for CVS and only</v>

1676
01:32:54.730 --> 01:32:57.780
costs 10 million a year.
That's incredible.
Yeah,

1677
01:32:57.860 --> 01:32:58.693
<v 0>and she owns it,</v>

1678
01:32:58.910 --> 01:33:03.910
so she makes in two years close to $100 million fucking Christ just to be mean

1679
01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:10.370
to beat bull.
You'll listen to me,
God,

1680
01:33:10.371 --> 01:33:12.320
that would encourage you to be just that much meaner.

1681
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:16.110
Imagine what her given puss eat and instructions is like,
oh,
ah.

1682
01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:19.990
<v 4>Stuart came in second place though.
25 to 30 million a year</v>

1683
01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:22.830
<v 0>pop out on the daily show.
Huh?
Well,</v>

1684
01:33:22.831 --> 01:33:25.180
he probably owns a piece of coal Baer report to,

1685
01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:30.460
<v 4>I hear about Tom Brokaw and that fucking cancer.
No,
he has bone marrow cancer,</v>

1686
01:33:30.461 --> 01:33:32.530
which is like the world.
It's horrible.
Yeah.

1687
01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:37.890
<v 0>Cut to Alex Jones.
The CIA doesn't want Tom Brokaw alive.</v>

1688
01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:42.000
As they get older,
they get more dangerous because they have the information.

1689
01:33:42.001 --> 01:33:45.150
They know that the end is coming near and that's when the CIA takes them out.

1690
01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:47.670
If you look at those old guys,
they always die when they're old.

1691
01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:51.270
See he when they're old,
it's when they're dangerous.

1692
01:33:51.271 --> 01:33:52.560
They don't have anything to lose so they die.

1693
01:33:52.570 --> 01:33:56.280
They kill him to make it look like it's old age and they get them right before

1694
01:33:56.281 --> 01:34:00.750
they talk.
This is the reason.
What the fuck's his name?

1695
01:34:00.751 --> 01:34:04.130
Did a fake,
the moon landings.
A Kubrick,

1696
01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:07.750
Stanley Kubrick known working for NASA.

1697
01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:09.640
He was a Nasa Shill,

1698
01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:14.700
made the Moon landings that kill Sandy Kubik before he turns 72 backers.

1699
01:34:19.850 --> 01:34:23.700
Hilarious that they,
they all seem to dive in their bowl.
Well that's the thing.

1700
01:34:23.710 --> 01:34:26.620
They die when they're old but they know we were about to spill the beans.

1701
01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:29.730
I never,
I don't listen to do that much.
I'm going to have to listen to them more.

1702
01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:30.960
You've got to listen to it in real life.

1703
01:34:30.961 --> 01:34:33.980
If you had them in the studio with you will be a trip.
He would like him.

1704
01:34:34.290 --> 01:34:37.020
Alex Jones is a good dude.
No,
I had mind.
The things I've seen,
I've,

1705
01:34:37.021 --> 01:34:37.681
like I'm saying,

1706
01:34:37.681 --> 01:34:41.650
I haven't really watched like full on who has time for that stuff,
man.

1707
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:45.000
I don't have time.
I'm happy when I get a Rogan podcast in,
you know what I mean?

1708
01:34:45.001 --> 01:34:49.050
Or an eldest show up for listening.
Pleasure.
You know what I mean?
It's like,

1709
01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:54.090
yeah,
there's um,
there's only certain amount of time in the day you can't spend.

1710
01:34:54.330 --> 01:34:58.100
When I was younger,
I indulged a lot more on doom and gloom shit,

1711
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:59.570
but now I'm like,
listen man.

1712
01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.560
<v 1>Now I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,
I know the Illuminati they want.</v>

1713
01:35:04.650 --> 01:35:08.100
<v 0>You don't know what's going on.
You don't know what's going on.</v>

1714
01:35:08.130 --> 01:35:10.770
I don't know what's going on.
You don't know what's going on and the guest,
what?

1715
01:35:10.771 --> 01:35:14.580
They don't even know what's going on because it's more than like one person or

1716
01:35:14.581 --> 01:35:17.730
one group that's affecting what's going on in this world.

1717
01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:22.170
They're not all in cahoots.
They're not all working together.
Stop it.

1718
01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:23.610
It's not that organized.

1719
01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:28.640
There's a chaotic whole movement going on right now and everyone's scrambling

1720
01:35:29.130 --> 01:35:30.420
for their own piece of the pie.

1721
01:35:30.450 --> 01:35:33.150
Everyone's scrambling to have a position of influence,

1722
01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.080
but the idea that one group above all others is in control of this whole thing.

1723
01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:40.320
That's not true.
There's a bunch of people that have big effects on it,

1724
01:35:40.321 --> 01:35:41.130
but this is a,

1725
01:35:41.130 --> 01:35:45.090
there's a social change movement that's going on in this world right now that

1726
01:35:45.091 --> 01:35:49.080
they will talk about in the future and it'll make the renaissance looked like a

1727
01:35:49.081 --> 01:35:50.280
fucking tea party.

1728
01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:54.540
This is going to make the 60s look like the 50s this is what's going on in

1729
01:35:54.541 --> 01:35:58.980
America in 2014 the world.
This is getting the world.
Absolutely.

1730
01:35:59.190 --> 01:36:04.190
This is going to change everything and it's happening in just a few decades has

1731
01:36:05.041 --> 01:36:09.120
happening over the period of just 2030 years.

1732
01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:13.290
The whole world is going to be completely different and no one can stop it.

1733
01:36:13.330 --> 01:36:14.770
We're not currently modality

1734
01:36:14.890 --> 01:36:18.900
<v 1>just start popping off and we're going to be integrated with the technology and</v>

1735
01:36:19.230 --> 01:36:21.960
all that craziness.
Yeah,
that Kurt's while Shit,

1736
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:24.840
there's just started going over that again because of that NAM show recently I

1737
01:36:24.841 --> 01:36:25.410
went by there,

1738
01:36:25.410 --> 01:36:28.980
the booth of the company cars wireless struck up that conversation with a friend

1739
01:36:28.981 --> 01:36:29.880
of mine and was like,
man,

1740
01:36:29.881 --> 01:36:33.900
this dude I got to leave cause my mind's starting to go like all over the place.

1741
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.150
<v 0>He gets a lot of Shit,
man.
It's fascinating.
Listen to naysayers,</v>

1742
01:36:37.151 --> 01:36:39.890
talk about Kurzweil.
That guy predicted so many things in,

1743
01:36:39.891 --> 01:36:41.410
invented so many things already.

1744
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:46.300
He's been responsible for so many different inventions.
I mean the,
he's a,

1745
01:36:46.330 --> 01:36:49.010
he's a legit super genius.
Like I've,

1746
01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.470
I've had a chance to talk to a couple of dudes in my life where I knew that
like,

1747
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.710
I,
I really shouldn't be allowed to talk to them.

1748
01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.850
Like I'm way too still actually be talking to them.
It's not fair.

1749
01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:05.740
And one of them was John Carmack who's the lead programmer for its software.

1750
01:37:05.741 --> 01:37:10.060
He made,
made quake,
he invented the,
uh,
like the original quake engine,

1751
01:37:10.210 --> 01:37:13.210
which is like this incredible three dimensional game engine.

1752
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:14.710
And the other one was Kurzweil.

1753
01:37:15.010 --> 01:37:19.000
And that's Kurzweil started talking about the future and about what computers

1754
01:37:19.001 --> 01:37:22.150
will be able to do and the exponential growth of this technology and how it will

1755
01:37:22.151 --> 01:37:24.000
lead to artificial intelligence.

1756
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.500
It'll be indistinguishable from organic intelligence.

1757
01:37:26.501 --> 01:37:30.730
And it wasn't a matter of whether or not it's going to happen.
It's just time.

1758
01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:34.810
It's just time.
People are going to keep this path going.
And I listened to him.

1759
01:37:34.811 --> 01:37:39.380
I was like,
I walked,
when we left his place,
it was me and the camera guy,

1760
01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:43.360
camera guys,
and my friend Todd,
who was the producer of my show.

1761
01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:46.420
And we just sat and looked at each other like,
fuck like what?
This guy,

1762
01:37:46.421 --> 01:37:50.260
just what is coming next man,
this guy just scared the fucking shit out of me.

1763
01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:54.790
Just thinking about the reality of you're in the presence of the one of the

1764
01:37:54.791 --> 01:37:56.550
world's genius inventors

1765
01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:59.760
<v 1>and he's telling you what the fuck's going to happen.
And you're like,
he's,</v>

1766
01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:04.410
I think he's right.
God dammit,
he's right.
Holy Shit here man.

1767
01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:09.120
There's a lot of crazy scary shit going on.
Unless the aliens land it's on.

1768
01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:13.870
It's just a matter of time.
I have a buddy,
I won't say his name,
please say,

1769
01:38:13.871 --> 01:38:16.170
isn't it?
No,
I can't cause uh,

1770
01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:18.630
what I'm going to tell you and you'll understand why like sitting in his

1771
01:38:18.631 --> 01:38:19.530
apartment the other day,

1772
01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:24.860
like God just chilling and he's real techie kind of guy and he pulls out his

1773
01:38:24.991 --> 01:38:29.100
computer and he's like,
watch this.
And he doesn't have internet in this place.

1774
01:38:29.101 --> 01:38:33.020
Any of this stuff.
He like hacked into every network around him and so the,

1775
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:36.720
and this is just a dude who picked up a book,
he hasn't been learning in this,

1776
01:38:36.721 --> 01:38:38.190
are trying to hack for years,

1777
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:42.630
picked up a book that told him by this one device and through that device how he

1778
01:38:42.631 --> 01:38:43.520
can just go about at night.

1779
01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:46.560
He can get anything you he wants from any way you can get your phone,

1780
01:38:46.690 --> 01:38:50.010
if you can get you anything like it like that.
And you know he's not bad guy.

1781
01:38:50.011 --> 01:38:52.320
He was just like,
is that crazy or what?
And like when I thought about it,

1782
01:38:52.321 --> 01:38:56.160
it was like everything in my life is on my phone or my computer.
I was like,

1783
01:38:56.730 --> 01:38:59.480
I got people at my wife how,
how many firewalls cannot put up in this.

1784
01:38:59.490 --> 01:39:01.770
And he was like,
you know,
it doesn't even matter.
I can get through them.

1785
01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:05.710
And I was just like,
wow dude.
It's like you really,
it's crazy.
You're you,

1786
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:08.190
we are just living naked out there completely.

1787
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:11.450
And it's going to get more and more naked too.
Oh yeah,
like the naked you,

1788
01:39:11.451 --> 01:39:13.230
you feel no,
this is the beginning of naked.

1789
01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:16.350
There's going to be no secrets anymore,
man.
It's going to be real hard.

1790
01:39:16.351 --> 01:39:17.400
But the intellectual property,

1791
01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:21.120
because there's gonna be a dude is rushing to put out an Everlast song.

1792
01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:25.050
You're going to have to make your shit and recorded on like fucking old wax like

1793
01:39:25.051 --> 01:39:25.440
those.

1794
01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:29.010
How did they use to do those old recordings was totally analog tape machines

1795
01:39:29.011 --> 01:39:31.620
still dude,
I still got tested.
Are you going to have to do,

1796
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:34.060
you're going to have to do that and we'll go back to the eye.

1797
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:38.400
The moment where you're going to release it because otherwise people,

1798
01:39:38.401 --> 01:39:41.280
if you have it on your hard drive,
some asshole's going to wake.

1799
01:39:41.290 --> 01:39:43.590
I know motherfuckers on awake at five in the morning that's,

1800
01:39:43.591 --> 01:39:44.520
we'll download a shit.

1801
01:39:44.610 --> 01:39:47.940
So you're snoozing away and he's downloading things for your computer.

1802
01:39:47.941 --> 01:39:52.080
You think your computers off and he's just leeching files off of it.
It's crazy,

1803
01:39:52.081 --> 01:39:56.130
man.
It's possible.
It's just,
it's all numbers like dude.
And my buddy told me,

1804
01:39:56.131 --> 01:39:59.340
he's like a week away from being able to do the thing where he can turn your

1805
01:39:59.341 --> 01:40:01.860
camera on without you knowing it and see on your,
in your house.

1806
01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:04.820
I wouldn't be surprised just like I just got to figure out,

1807
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:07.470
but like he's like learning the language,
like you know the computer,

1808
01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.750
that actual whatever they call that,

1809
01:40:09.751 --> 01:40:13.220
where they used to call that language C to ostracize,
it's still called Dobbs.

1810
01:40:13.221 --> 01:40:16.410
That was one of them,
that kind of thing.
Whatever the modern one of that is,

1811
01:40:16.411 --> 01:40:19.260
he's like just all knee deep in it.
Yeah.

1812
01:40:19.261 --> 01:40:23.130
You remember when they used to have the dos window and windows that you could

1813
01:40:23.131 --> 01:40:25.230
pull it up and I enter in things.

1814
01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:28.930
I don't have that on computers and terminal on MACs in terms of,

1815
01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:29.793
that's what it's called.

1816
01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:33.150
So you could get in there and fuck around and do things every Mac is actually,

1817
01:40:33.151 --> 01:40:34.950
you could,
if you turn it off,

1818
01:40:34.951 --> 01:40:38.490
there's a way to turn it back on and it's a windows computer.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1819
01:40:38.491 --> 01:40:41.340
You could do that.
I forgot.
I just learned that like not too long ago.

1820
01:40:41.730 --> 01:40:43.130
I was like word.
Yeah,

1821
01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:46.380
you just have to install windows on it and kept by a copy of windows,

1822
01:40:46.381 --> 01:40:51.381
a legit copy of windows because windows used to be that Mac was on a different

1823
01:40:51.811 --> 01:40:54.010
platform.
They had a different processor

1824
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.400
<v 0>and then they switched over to Intel these to have the IBM processors.
Right.</v>

1825
01:40:57.430 --> 01:41:01.820
Isn't that what it was?
And then they switched over to Intel when IBM,
the the,

1826
01:41:01.850 --> 01:41:05.350
the platform could only take it so high in order to get like those three

1827
01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:07.570
gigabyte they had.
So they switched over.

1828
01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:10.720
It was a real crazy problem for a lot of people cause they had software that

1829
01:41:10.721 --> 01:41:13.540
only worked on the old macs.
That legacy software

1830
01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:17.660
<v 2>you?
Well,
I had it for example,
like I had back in the early days,
I had pro tools,</v>

1831
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:22.100
the version of pro tools five and then all that pentium stuff started coming out

1832
01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:26.690
and like I had all these,
what they call cracked five

1833
01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:32.990
of like waves and all this stuff and like I didn't want to move into the next

1834
01:41:32.991 --> 01:41:37.880
thing for years because I just had this whole like $40,000 studio setup that was

1835
01:41:37.881 --> 01:41:38.601
working fine.

1836
01:41:38.601 --> 01:41:43.110
But like I couldn't really work with any other computers for a long time.
Can you

1837
01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:47.200
<v 0>get a crack file?
Can you still download?
Like everyone's nodding.</v>

1838
01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:50.400
Let's pretend they're nodding.
No,
no,
no.
You can't do that.

1839
01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:54.860
You can't do they know who never does it?
Brian,
Brian Red Band

1840
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:58.400
<v 2>actually,
you know they make it so much easier nowadays.
Like for like Photoshop,</v>

1841
01:41:58.401 --> 01:42:03.401
you pay 20 $30 a month and you get every single one of their programs,

1842
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:06.140
you know,
for free every month.
So it's like,

1843
01:42:06.141 --> 01:42:09.310
like you have premiere dollars a mile.
I think it was $39 a something.

1844
01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:12.290
I can't remember what it is.
But it's like before it used to be like,
you know,

1845
01:42:12.291 --> 01:42:16.280
Photoshop was like $1,400 or something like that and premiere was $1,000 but now

1846
01:42:16.281 --> 01:42:17.750
you just have like this monthly fee,

1847
01:42:17.751 --> 01:42:20.930
kind of like cable subscription and you just get all their programs.
I mean,

1848
01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:24.410
he's a lot more.
So second of all,
it's like when I bought that system,

1849
01:42:24.411 --> 01:42:27.680
it came like that.
The guy who built it for me just put all that stuff in there.

1850
01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:30.680
So it was like,
I mean,
but I mean I don't download movies,
music,

1851
01:42:30.710 --> 01:42:34.090
I don't know how to,
I don't know how to go to like a,
a torrent and do I just,

1852
01:42:34.190 --> 01:42:37.790
I used to,
I like,
I had an engineer.
That would be nice to see what he's done.

1853
01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:41.720
Government.
No,
I'm saying I wish I did.
I wish I did.

1854
01:42:41.721 --> 01:42:45.890
I would download a bunch of people are downloading mine.
You wouldn't.

1855
01:42:45.891 --> 01:42:50.210
I know you wouldn't.
A loyal ethical man.
It ain't hard,
dude.

1856
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:53.810
It's pretty damn amazing.
But then,
you know,
if I did start doing it though,

1857
01:42:53.811 --> 01:42:57.560
I wouldn't complain when the music and the movies got shittier and Shittier and

1858
01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.200
Shittier.

1859
01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:02.850
<v 0>That's true.
That's a good point man.
That's a good point.
There's a guy,
um,
on my,</v>

1860
01:43:02.851 --> 01:43:07.200
uh,
uh,
one of my favorite message boards that posted a thread that he's,
uh,

1861
01:43:07.290 --> 01:43:08.850
he's uh,
a copyright criminal.

1862
01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:12.090
He apparently just downloaded some shit and you know,

1863
01:43:12.091 --> 01:43:16.410
just doing bit torn Shit and he downloaded one that was being tracked so they

1864
01:43:16.411 --> 01:43:18.960
got ahold of him.
I don't know the exact details of his story,

1865
01:43:18.961 --> 01:43:23.810
but he's just a regular dude who just has a regular job and he's going,
you know,

1866
01:43:23.850 --> 01:43:26.730
he's going through court right now.
I hate,
he owes a lot of money.

1867
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:27.763
You're doing that,
Jane,

1868
01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:29.610
<v 2>is that a movie thing?
Is it a movie thing?</v>

1869
01:43:29.611 --> 01:43:33.660
Because the movie industry has done a lot better job of scaring people away from

1870
01:43:33.661 --> 01:43:36.390
doing it.
Then the music,
I remember the music industry for a second.

1871
01:43:36.391 --> 01:43:37.410
When it was first going on,

1872
01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:40.680
they had pinned all these kids down and like they were getting going to go to

1873
01:43:40.681 --> 01:43:43.710
jail and like hundreds of thousands of songs like there was like,

1874
01:43:43.711 --> 01:43:45.690
and then they all backed off because everybody's like,
oh,

1875
01:43:45.691 --> 01:43:47.000
they're kids in New Orleans.
It's like,
no,

1876
01:43:47.010 --> 01:43:48.210
their parents should have paid for that.

1877
01:43:48.211 --> 01:43:52.060
That's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of music and work that people put

1878
01:43:52.150 --> 01:43:54.350
<v 0>your lead cost.
Me,
if I make a cheat,</v>

1879
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:58.910
that Acoustic Gregory cost me 25 grand to make.
All right,
and that's cheap.

1880
01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:02.840
That's cheap.
That is so cool that you could do it all on your own.

1881
01:44:02.841 --> 01:44:05.930
You know what I mean?
That's another benefit to acoustic,
you know what I mean?

1882
01:44:05.931 --> 01:44:09.770
So it's like stealing that is stealing regardless.
You know what I mean?

1883
01:44:09.771 --> 01:44:12.770
I feel that way.
You know what I mean?
I'm like this though.
I won't front.

1884
01:44:13.130 --> 01:44:17.450
I have musically,
I would download a song and check it out.
If I like it though,

1885
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:21.710
I will buy that fucking song.
I guarantee.
I think a lot of people do that.

1886
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:26.120
A lot of people support.
I don't,
I don't,
I don't mind that I,
I don't mind you.

1887
01:44:26.170 --> 01:44:29.390
I just,
why I was happy when they kind of gave people those much bigger listening

1888
01:44:29.391 --> 01:44:33.080
windows on iTunes because you can get a much like they used to give you like

1889
01:44:33.081 --> 01:44:36.320
that just little book or something and you'd be like,
all right,
that's the hook.

1890
01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.090
What about the rest of the songs?
So now you get,

1891
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:40.620
you get a good like 30 seconds or something like that too.

1892
01:44:40.670 --> 01:44:44.540
You can really make a good call I think on whether you want a song or not.
Yeah,

1893
01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:46.070
that's big.
I liked that.

1894
01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:48.590
I liked that they have all your little even care and they said listen to the

1895
01:44:48.591 --> 01:44:51.320
whole song for free right now.
If you like it,

1896
01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:53.990
you can't leave here and listen to it again unless you buy it.
Right.

1897
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:56.960
That's not a bad idea because a lot of the good songs you want to hear over and

1898
01:44:56.961 --> 01:44:58.850
over and over again,
sometimes a good song,

1899
01:44:58.851 --> 01:45:01.070
you don't need to appreciate the first time.
You're lucky.

1900
01:45:01.130 --> 01:45:04.520
You have to hear it like a second time and a third time to really know what the

1901
01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:07.340
is going on.
That's exactly,
I don't,
I don't mind.
That's the same thing.

1902
01:45:07.341 --> 01:45:09.820
That's why I wouldn't mind like a guy who honestly goes and I'm going to an

1903
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:12.040
download the songs.
I mean,
I really like that song.
I'm going to go buy that.

1904
01:45:12.041 --> 01:45:13.970
Right.
Not only that,
usually if I like your song,

1905
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:16.910
I'll buy your whole album in chance it,
you know what I mean?
That's my deal.

1906
01:45:16.911 --> 01:45:19.280
It's like,
oh,
that single was hard.
I liked that record.
I'm gonna buy that out.

1907
01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:20.081
Yeah.
I'm,

1908
01:45:20.081 --> 01:45:23.600
I'm one of those dudes that gets into an album and I'll listen to nothing but

1909
01:45:23.601 --> 01:45:26.000
that album for like four or five weeks,

1910
01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:29.360
I just overplayed that shit in my car to the point where I'm listening to the

1911
01:45:29.361 --> 01:45:31.310
same songs over and over and over again,

1912
01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:35.600
which is so much different than how I feel about comedy.
Like comedy.
I can,

1913
01:45:35.601 --> 01:45:37.850
let's do it a couple,
two,
three times,
but then I'm done.

1914
01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:41.700
I don't want to hear the same beliefs for a while.
Put it down.
Look old,

1915
01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:44.720
some old school shit like old Richard Pryor,
I could still listened to,

1916
01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:47.090
but like live on the sunset strip comes on.

1917
01:45:47.091 --> 01:45:51.770
I can watch that anytime you're delirious
classics.

1918
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:55.240
But some songs man,
like I,
I will listen to,

1919
01:45:55.610 --> 01:45:58.670
I remember the first time I heard a,
the ballot of Curtis Lowe,

1920
01:45:58.890 --> 01:46:03.710
the scattered song.
I must have listened to that song every day for a month.

1921
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:07.070
I mean there's every fucking day I would get in my car.

1922
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:11.080
<v 5>Bam,
boom</v>

1923
01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:15.770
<v 0>to do,
do,
do,
do,
do.
That's a fucking beautiful song.</v>

1924
01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:19.430
And that's a Leonard Skinner and song that most people aren't even aware of.

1925
01:46:19.610 --> 01:46:21.410
It's like one of the all time great songs.

1926
01:46:21.411 --> 01:46:25.070
Everybody always brings up sweet home Alabama and they call me the breeze.

1927
01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:29.780
All outstanding songs.
But God damn the ballot of Curtis.

1928
01:46:29.781 --> 01:46:32.540
Lowe's got some soul to it and it's a good one.

1929
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:36.230
That song's got some beauty man.
This beauty to that song,

1930
01:46:37.130 --> 01:46:41.240
it's real.
It's alive.
You know?
That's,
and that's,
again,

1931
01:46:41.241 --> 01:46:45.530
that's a song with not a lot of shit going on.
It's just,
you know,

1932
01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:50.310
a guy singing and guitars and background shit.
But not too,
no the perfect

1933
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:53.880
<v 1>amount to good song,
the perfect amount.</v>

1934
01:46:53.881 --> 01:46:58.881
Just like when you get Everlast and studio guitar.

1935
01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:03.350
But before it gets time I gotta I gotta say I gave it.
I,
you know,

1936
01:47:03.351 --> 01:47:06.270
I didn't come in last year and do this.
I did it the year before though.

1937
01:47:06.271 --> 01:47:09.810
It's coming up on that time of year when we're doing our,
our great strides walk.

1938
01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:13.830
So we're going to cystic fibrosis,
cystic fibrosis walk.
Um,

1939
01:47:13.890 --> 01:47:14.930
it's going to be in May,
but I,

1940
01:47:14.931 --> 01:47:19.850
I just tweeted out a link on my Twitter if you could retweet it right now.
Uh,

1941
01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:24.340
you know,
it's for our walk,
you know,
you guys,
Joe Rogan and my buddy Jason now,

1942
01:47:24.341 --> 01:47:24.991
unless you guys,

1943
01:47:24.991 --> 01:47:28.590
you're both of your audience stepped up so big last time when I had a fall and

1944
01:47:28.591 --> 01:47:31.560
um,
and,
and read cause I really only asked the two audiences.

1945
01:47:31.561 --> 01:47:36.210
I didn't really do much else and I think last time we got it up to about
$20,000.

1946
01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.780
That's awesome.
That's beautiful.
The walk.
That's great.
You know,
I'm also a,

1947
01:47:39.790 --> 01:47:43.020
I'm retweeted that right now,
ladies and gentlemen online.
It's done.

1948
01:47:43.021 --> 01:47:47.520
It's up there.
So go there.
Cystic fibrosis,
you know,
you can check it out.

1949
01:47:47.521 --> 01:47:50.700
It's pulmonary,
respiratory disease.
We've,
but we've been through it here,

1950
01:47:50.701 --> 01:47:54.090
you know,
my daughter suffers from it and um,
uh,
you know,

1951
01:47:54.091 --> 01:47:57.180
we're just looking to get it wiped off the books because they're close and uh,

1952
01:47:57.900 --> 01:47:59.970
you know,
it can be gone.
You can,
you know,

1953
01:47:59.971 --> 01:48:03.090
we can get this gone and I can be in here begging for money for something else.

1954
01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:07.170
Yeah.
And some other good costs,
you know what I mean?
Cause uh,
you know,

1955
01:48:07.171 --> 01:48:10.210
like I said,
the audiences have stepped up and,
and you know,
this,
you know,

1956
01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:13.110
besides just,
you know,
our friendship,

1957
01:48:13.111 --> 01:48:15.630
that's one of the reasons I always come back when I leave here.
I always,

1958
01:48:15.631 --> 01:48:19.260
you know,
get a lot of love and positive response and,
and,
and uh,

1959
01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:21.900
that's beautiful man.
A nice thing.
It's a nice thing.

1960
01:48:21.930 --> 01:48:25.980
I remember when I actually had quit Twitter and restarted my Twitter the first

1961
01:48:25.981 --> 01:48:30.160
time I came in,
I had no followers are like couple hundred.
I think it's,

1962
01:48:30.190 --> 01:48:33.720
I've tried like 40 something thousand.
Now I'm going to donate right now.

1963
01:48:33.721 --> 01:48:36.440
I'm doing even right now as you're playing,
look at that as you're planning.

1964
01:48:36.490 --> 01:48:38.010
Like I said,
we're going to try something.
Um,

1965
01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:41.100
this is actually something I wrote in Nashville with a couple of guys that I

1966
01:48:41.101 --> 01:48:43.470
don't know if it's ever going to come to fruition.
If anything,

1967
01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:46.530
I'm not sure if it's going to,
if it'll ever be on one of my records,

1968
01:48:46.531 --> 01:48:49.470
but I figured let's try something like that.
Do something new.

1969
01:48:50.970 --> 01:48:54.510
I don't even know what this court,
I think this is called a,
it ain't easy.

1970
01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:26.880
<v 7>Hi.
With a zipper.
Scar from the stitches.</v>

1971
01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:30.720
None.
No.
My hands with time

1972
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:39.330
shy.
Getting other hand
honesty.

1973
01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:43.160
When know some kind of sad,

1974
01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.033
easy.

1975
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:50.120
<v 6>Sometimes I'm waiting this or house.</v>

1976
01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.390
Oh,
we'll keep following

1977
01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.433

01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:06.290
<v 8>Hey z.</v>

1980
01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:14.110
Wow.
This bitch of frame

1981
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:21.430
one Adam made me kinder.

1982
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:26.650
Got a wish and a photo graph.

1983
01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:29.480
Warman made me laugh.

1984
01:50:31.530 --> 01:50:34.000
Word Adam Navajo go home.
Fine.

1985
01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:42.473
Steve.

1986
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:53.700
<v 6>Some town as a hot spot.</v>

1987
01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:56.500
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

1988
01:50:57.670 --> 01:50:59.600
<v 6>you whole Wilkie found</v>

1989
01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:02.420
<v 8>hey z</v>

1990
01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:06.590
<v 9>Shannon and get a ride from their stock.</v>

1991
01:51:10.210 --> 01:51:12.350
<v 6>Sometimes the waiting is the hardest.</v>

1992
01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:33.180
<v 1>My new little more work on that one,
but please stop judging yourself,</v>

1993
01:51:33.370 --> 01:51:36.360
which it was beautiful.
It's all you can do with a new song though,
is judge it.

1994
01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:40.350
You gotta just,
Oh,
is this good?
Am I working it?
Of course you do.
You have to.

1995
01:51:40.830 --> 01:51:43.140
It's like a joke you're working on.
Let me try it out here.

1996
01:51:43.141 --> 01:51:45.230
That's what I'm saying.
I want to do.
I'm spare,
moved out.

1997
01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:48.300
See what the feedback on it is.
You know,
I'd like to do it.

1998
01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:51.480
I liked it there so similar so I can understand it without knowing anything

1999
01:51:51.481 --> 01:51:54.450
about music I can kind of at least appreciate.
It was like,
you know,

2000
01:51:54.451 --> 01:51:55.920
I was wondering what I was going to do today.

2001
01:51:55.921 --> 01:51:58.920
You know what you do in that other song before?

2002
01:51:58.921 --> 01:52:03.490
I don't know if I've heard you do that before the uh,
yeah.
Did you do that?
Yeah.

2003
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:07.630
Did you ever do that in studio?
I feel like,
did he do sex and candy?
No,
no,
no,
no.

2004
01:52:07.631 --> 01:52:09.240
I know I did.
Do you want it done?

2005
01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:13.230
You want to know that song is my version of the songs.
By the way,

2006
01:52:13.231 --> 01:52:17.010
when I covered some of these songs,
I just,
I just Kinda do what I think it is.

2007
01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:20.880
That song was a song that I liked the first few times that it came out.

2008
01:52:20.881 --> 01:52:24.480
I thought it was interesting because I'd never heard a song like that,
but then,

2009
01:52:24.481 --> 01:52:29.190
um,
I kind of grew tired of it.
But you,
your version of it,

2010
01:52:29.250 --> 01:52:32.370
it's very different.
It's a little bit faster I think.
Well,
it's cooler.

2011
01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:36.300
It's a good song.
It's a very good song.
I like it.

2012
01:52:36.301 --> 01:52:41.280
A lot of songs when I often like warm myself up with,
so yeah.
But again,

2013
01:52:41.281 --> 01:52:43.350
this is my version and you know,
if I butcher it up,

2014
01:52:43.410 --> 01:52:45.950
y'all just going to have to dig it like that.
You know what I mean?

2015
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:10.360
<v 7>Hang now downtown,

2021

01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:59.290

She was platform double Swede.

2027
01:54:09.970 --> 01:54:14.970

01:54:47.050 --> 01:54:52.050
who's that lounge chair who's at cast de Lille stills and my reaction following

2034
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:57.830
the shoulder is a tree

2035
01:55:01.770 --> 01:55:06.550
is a tree.
Yeah.
Who is my spin?

2036
01:55:06.551 --> 01:55:07.384
Matt?

2037
01:55:07.390 --> 01:55:08.223
<v 6>Sure.</v>

2038
01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:14.950
<v 2>I could understand the words in that.
Like there's a,</v>

2039
01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.870
there's a bunch of the words in that other one where I don't know what the fuck.

2040
01:55:17.871 --> 01:55:22.250
Who was saying devious stairs in my direction now I know it's like beef eaters

2041
01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:24.050
cord in there somewhere.
I know.

2042
01:55:24.051 --> 01:55:28.310
I threw a really bad quarter though somewhere beautiful.
I kept it moving,

2043
01:55:28.311 --> 01:55:30.240
so hopefully it worked.
But a slang,

2044
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.940
I smell six candy.
They're real slow and they do it to like a smell.

2045
01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:41.550
Samson candy.
Yeah.

2046
01:55:41.670 --> 01:55:44.010
That's real.
I think the guy who was

2047
01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:47.550
<v 1>singing that song,
the original dude,
it's a great version,</v>

2048
01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:50.760
but it's the version of a man is trying to get laid.
He's like,

2049
01:55:50.761 --> 01:55:52.500
he's trying to be sexy.
It's been a little sexy.

2050
01:55:54.190 --> 01:55:55.320
<v 2>I fucked violence,</v>

2051
01:55:57.250 --> 01:55:58.083
<v 7>sex,</v>

2052
01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:03.630
<v 2>see song.
You don't need to try and be sexy with it.
That's why I like it so much.</v>

2053
01:56:03.631 --> 01:56:04.830
That's fucking sexy song.

2054
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:07.200
He imagined what snacks and candy would actually smell like though.

2055
01:56:07.201 --> 01:56:10.080
That'd be a fucking weird gummy bears and yeast infections.

2056
01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:12.990
I was thinking snickers bars,

2057
01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:20.100
<v 1>bars,
bleach,
bleachy smell of loads.</v>

2058
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:26.430
Especially if you pull out,
squirt it all over.
Bleachy smell to it.

2059
01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:28.611
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

2060
01:56:28.611 --> 01:56:33.611
but he's gummy bears and or you might want to patent that one right there.

2061
01:56:33.831 --> 01:56:35.960
You want to move up to a better crowd as well?

2062
01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:42.850
<v 1>Definitely stock up on rubbers.
Tell you why.
Because that shit is catchy.</v>

2063
01:56:43.570 --> 01:56:48.040
Both gummy bears and eastern factions are both contagious.
Um,

2064
01:56:48.190 --> 01:56:51.820
I dunno,
I've ever done ends on the show ends.
Oh No.

2065
01:56:52.930 --> 01:56:57.010
What does it mean?
Anything?
So either this,
let's try that real quick.

2066
01:56:58.160 --> 01:56:59.740
We'll do one on one.
Um,

2067
01:57:04.130 --> 01:57:04.963
<v 9>your mother</v>

2068
01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:32.323
<v 7>phd</v>

2069
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.370
now is Wayne Table Ran to paint companies,

2070
01:57:37.371 --> 01:57:41.620
downsize and then flees.
Math is feeling,

2071
01:57:41.621 --> 01:57:45.490
can't stress,
don't even feel the effects.
When he says,

2072
01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:49.960
and it's hands had been blessed so miles off track,

2073
01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:55.060
it's not smoking crack and once a his brain starts and chain me yet shirt off

2074
01:57:55.451 --> 01:57:58.330
his back shoes I was feeling was announced.

2075
01:57:58.350 --> 01:58:03.350
Team now is down stream now certain he lacked Jesse James trying to still go

2076
01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:07.570
kiss full.
They Watson,
she but even being in school,

2077
01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:12.070
nervous whether to bounce back in blood and poop.

2078
01:58:14.230 --> 01:58:18.060
<v 9>Some people would wrap them follow</v>

2079
01:58:20.850 --> 01:58:23.330
rats they snatch out one night

2080
01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:29.680
and Sam,
Sam kids getting murdered,

2081

2082
01:58:43.110 --> 01:58:48.110

2083
01:58:48.970 --> 01:58:53.800
the men's,
they wrapped the flag.
You ran name wherein it's champagne.
Wait,

2084
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:56.710
Jews on the neck,
last stash crib.

2085
01:58:57.300 --> 01:59:01.450
Ain't no savings now span to Landon.

2086
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:05.030
She knew the bandit and stray machine.
Vanden smile.

2087
01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:08.800
Have to shopping sprees,
get an on knees,

2088
01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:11.760
hit the keys.
The old period you acting funny.

2089
01:59:12.050 --> 01:59:17.050
Come home one day by cam now to the wetlands out of Witty Palo.

2090
01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:21.060
The books you spin the rich,
she mad.
Swallow Paul

2091
01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:25.640
<v 9>as
some people would rammed him.</v>

2092
01:59:25.641 --> 01:59:29.940
Mother Rats,

2093
01:59:29.941 --> 01:59:33.730
they snitch on one and

2094
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:39.890
Sam,
Sam kids,
cute and mood is

2095
01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:45.460
so far we go and my hands,

2096
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:16.800
<v 7>no,
it was making money on the black hills long.</v>

2097
02:00:16.801 --> 02:00:21.801
Jack DMC,

2098
02:00:22.050 --> 02:00:22.883
they

2099
02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:33.250
disappear,

2100
02:00:39.470 --> 02:00:40.290
<v 9>robbed him.</v>

2101
02:00:40.290 --> 02:00:44.490
Mother Rats,

2102
02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:45.460
the snapshot.

2103
02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:51.980
Sam Sanchez get

2104
02:00:54.990 --> 02:00:56.410
super far.
We go

2105
02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:58.860
<v 7>and then for,</v>

2106
02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:03.650
<v 9>I said,
I went home.
My has</v>

2107
02:01:06.650 --> 02:01:07.760
wrapped their mother

2108
02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:12.530
rats.
This snapshot,

2109
02:01:18.870 --> 02:01:23.870
<v 7>Sam's Kids Mood for him.</v>

2110
02:01:32.370 --> 02:01:36.540
<v 1>Glorious.
Absolutely glorious.
Uh,
yeah,</v>

2111
02:01:36.541 --> 02:01:38.280
I never heard that acoustic version four.

2112
02:01:38.730 --> 02:01:40.040
I don't think I pulled it out a lot because

2113
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.200
<v 2>that mid section where I go to,</v>

2114
02:01:41.201 --> 02:01:43.000
I feel like it just loses something when I go to the,

2115
02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:46.340
the bridge without like an accompany us.
But it sounded all right right there.

2116
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:48.921
It's weird,
you know,

2117
02:01:48.921 --> 02:01:50.990
because you've got all these things going on your mind when it's just you and a

2118
02:01:50.991 --> 02:01:53.270
guitar.
You know,
like when you got a band to lean on,

2119
02:01:53.271 --> 02:01:56.640
it's like you can fuck up a little bit more.
You know,
there's no guy,

2120
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:59.240
Eric Clapton throws an occasional brick on stage,
you know,
I mean,

2121
02:01:59.241 --> 02:02:02.540
but you don't know it because he's a master and because he's got masters around

2122
02:02:02.541 --> 02:02:04.700
him.
You know.
That's interesting.
I never even,

2123
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:09.080
I throw a lot more breaks than that.
I build houses on stage.

2124
02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:13.160
I never even thought about that.
But yeah,
that must,

2125
02:02:13.330 --> 02:02:16.860
when you have a bunch of people also playing the same,
it's harder to catch up.

2126
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:17.810
Think about your jokes,
when you,

2127
02:02:17.811 --> 02:02:20.420
how many times do you stumbling into it a different way every night?
You know,

2128
02:02:20.421 --> 02:02:21.800
it's never exactly the same.

2129
02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:26.090
The rhythm changes cause you got your dealing with elements.

2130
02:02:26.091 --> 02:02:29.210
So when you were on stage,
do you ever like free ball?

2131
02:02:29.211 --> 02:02:32.210
Do you ever in the middle of a song you just decide to like riff a little bit?

2132
02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:36.270
Um,
not really because,
you know,
I'm,
I'm the,

2133
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:39.680
I'm a song writer so I'm a,
I want to say a slave to my songs,

2134
02:02:39.681 --> 02:02:44.080
but egotistically I'm a slave to my songs.
I live with my songs and,
but I mean,
I,

2135
02:02:44.081 --> 02:02:49.081
I always encourage my guys when I'm playing with a full band to stay true to my

2136
02:02:49.731 --> 02:02:52.910
song,
but live and breathe in it,
you know,
in other words,
go ahead.

2137
02:02:52.911 --> 02:02:54.680
If you feel it a little here,
a little there,

2138
02:02:54.681 --> 02:02:56.720
and it's going to compliment and you know,
don't,
you know,

2139
02:02:56.721 --> 02:03:01.721
I'm not a nut about like that lick you pulled on the third bar of second

2140
02:03:02.301 --> 02:03:05.480
section.
You know,
it's not like that.
As long as it's rock and roll,

2141
02:03:05.481 --> 02:03:06.660
it's not Beethoven.
You know what I mean?

2142
02:03:06.661 --> 02:03:09.890
He smashed his lungs were all partying and having fun and everybody's feeling
it.

2143
02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:12.050
That's what,
what,
what you're going for.

2144
02:03:12.070 --> 02:03:16.730
You study old classical shit like Beethoven or I wouldn't call it study.

2145
02:03:16.731 --> 02:03:20.990
Listen,
yeah.
Listen for ideas and you know,
things,

2146
02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:24.950
it all stems from that.
You know what I mean?
I wouldn't call myself a a,
you know,

2147
02:03:24.951 --> 02:03:26.570
uh,
uh,

2148
02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:31.700
a master of the knowledge of the history of music or anything.

2149
02:03:31.701 --> 02:03:34.550
But I,
you know,
I try to,
you know,
know where the roots,

2150
02:03:34.551 --> 02:03:35.800
I mean all rock and hold the blues.

2151
02:03:35.810 --> 02:03:40.010
Everything's kind of stems from that era of all that classical writing and then

2152
02:03:40.011 --> 02:03:44.290
a mixture of like when slaves and came to America with that and Gospel and you

2153
02:03:44.291 --> 02:03:45.430
know,
and,
and,

2154
02:03:45.431 --> 02:03:50.431
and classical all kind of formed and then you turned into jazz and rock and roll

2155
02:03:51.501 --> 02:03:56.030
and everything since and Blues Blues came here.
Right?
It was,
it was some blues,

2156
02:03:56.060 --> 02:04:00.480
Blues,
blues to my knowledge,
Blues is American.
Yeah.

2157
02:04:00.510 --> 02:04:03.790
Isn't is an American thing is built out of exactly what I'm saying.
This,
that,

2158
02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:08.210
the era of this,
of of the slave times and then and,
and the,
and the,

2159
02:04:08.211 --> 02:04:12.350
and the period right thereafter,
you know what I mean?
Um,

2160
02:04:12.710 --> 02:04:17.600
it was the combination of field songs and church music and you know,

2161
02:04:17.690 --> 02:04:19.340
this learning of other musics too,

2162
02:04:19.341 --> 02:04:22.700
but like that's basically where the blues comes from.
It's interesting.

2163
02:04:22.701 --> 02:04:26.060
I wonder what it must be like.
The,

2164
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:30.080
and everything since comes from that,
from the blues,
Blues and Jazz,

2165
02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:35.810
the pain and suffering of the slaves,
and then had to be there,
the origins of it.

2166
02:04:35.811 --> 02:04:38.790
Right.
I mean,
if you would have to imagine there's a lot of,
you know,

2167
02:04:38.791 --> 02:04:41.970
beautiful music and stuff that definitely came out of that.
Yeah.
Right.
I mean,

2168
02:04:41.971 --> 02:04:45.270
I mean it's like,
you know,
I,

2169
02:04:45.271 --> 02:04:50.271
in my personally in no way comparing my pain in life to slave pain back in days,

2170
02:04:51.601 --> 02:04:54.450
but I'm saying my experience in writing is my better stuff.

2171
02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:59.480
Even songs that are happier songs I write when I'm not feeling that happy.

2172
02:04:59.970 --> 02:05:01.650
You know what I mean?
Which is like,

2173
02:05:01.651 --> 02:05:04.470
if you're saying there's a lot of joyful slave songs,
you know what I mean?

2174
02:05:04.471 --> 02:05:05.940
That it gets sung and it's because,
you know,

2175
02:05:06.210 --> 02:05:09.510
I would imagine it's so dark as it is.
You don't need another dark song.

2176
02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:12.570
Cause let's take that darkness and turn it on its ass.
You know what I mean?

2177
02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:16.490
<v 0>Yeah.
Find a way to find joy and turn it upside down.</v>

2178
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:21.080
Hey kids lessons from,

2179
02:05:21.140 --> 02:05:25.700
Gee Everlast yeah,
I'm just,
I'm still taking lessons,
man.

2180
02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:29.240
You ever tried to put yourself back in the Beethoven days and imagine would have

2181
02:05:29.241 --> 02:05:30.890
been like trying to create music back then?

2182
02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:33.480
<v 2>I don't know if I would've been able to live long enough to tolerate some of the</v>

2183
02:05:33.481 --> 02:05:35.490
smells that probably existed back then.
Dude.

2184
02:05:35.491 --> 02:05:37.230
I just don't even think his ass like,
you know,

2185
02:05:37.231 --> 02:05:39.360
like when I watched those old shows and I just said,

2186
02:05:39.690 --> 02:05:41.490
it's weird that my mind goes places like this.

2187
02:05:41.491 --> 02:05:46.140
I used to rest that HBO show Rome and there was like an episode that literally

2188
02:05:46.141 --> 02:05:49.350
where they went like to the outdoor shitters having a conversation together and

2189
02:05:49.351 --> 02:05:52.260
like wipe their ass with like what looked like leather cloths.

2190
02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:53.131
And I was just like,

2191
02:05:53.131 --> 02:05:58.131
how awful this like sto cities must have dunk like of just human disgusting

2192
02:06:01.290 --> 02:06:02.760
feces and nest.

2193
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:08.480
<v 0>Well,
I mean even the rich people must have stunk to high heaven,
man.</v>

2194
02:06:08.620 --> 02:06:09.530
Yeah,
everybody is stuck.

2195
02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:12.950
I couldn't imagine what the streets must have smelled like.
I mean,

2196
02:06:12.951 --> 02:06:16.220
didn't they have an issue with that?
Have you know what,
you've been to Venice,

2197
02:06:16.221 --> 02:06:19.470
right?
No,
never been to Venice,
Venice,
California,
no.
Venice,
Italy.

2198
02:06:20.090 --> 02:06:23.180
You can kind of get a gist if you go to Venice.
I'm sorry,

2199
02:06:23.181 --> 02:06:27.690
I stepped up to Mike to put this down without it falling
case can fall,

2200
02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:28.533
not the guitar.

2201
02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:31.530
<v 2>Um,
uh,
but in Venice,
like every other third,</v>

2202
02:06:31.531 --> 02:06:36.531
fourth canal you rock by as like a sewage canal and it's like it's badly third

2203
02:06:36.871 --> 02:06:39.000
or forth.
It seemed like that to me,
I could be wrong,

2204
02:06:39.001 --> 02:06:42.490
but there's quite a few like you back,
you know,
they're not the main walkways,

2205
02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:44.290
but when you cut through a couple of main walkways you'll,

2206
02:06:44.291 --> 02:06:48.200
you'll walk through like these things that seem to be sewer canals and less and

2207
02:06:48.201 --> 02:06:50.940
less the day I was there,
it was just a really bad day for them.

2208
02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:54.240
But I think they were sewer canals.
But it's like you can kind of get like,
wow,

2209
02:06:54.270 --> 02:06:59.190
every street probably smelled like this way back in the day in Rome and here and

2210
02:07:00.930 --> 02:07:03.150
imagine New York and like the 18 hundreds,
man.

2211
02:07:03.450 --> 02:07:04.110
<v 0>Oh yeah.</v>

2212
02:07:04.110 --> 02:07:08.850
Like imagining that gang in New York days smell now is,

2213
02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:13.900
is like imagine it then like on the five corners were the whole gangs in New

2214
02:07:14.670 --> 02:07:18.570
York.
Shit was going on.
All that,
just dead bodies in the street.
Yeah.

2215
02:07:18.571 --> 02:07:20.850
That gangs in New York Shit was pretty wild.

2216
02:07:20.851 --> 02:07:24.570
It's hard to imagine that that was really going on back then that day.
You know,

2217
02:07:24.571 --> 02:07:26.760
we think of New York has always been like a normal city,

2218
02:07:26.790 --> 02:07:30.120
but ruthless violence back then ruthless.

2219
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:35.160
So the water systems of imperial war,
Rome,
they had like this whole,

2220
02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:39.580
uh,
this whole system of a,
of getting rid of their waste,

2221
02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:43.270
but they did a terrible job of it.
People got sick.
Fuck,

2222
02:07:45.110 --> 02:07:47.720
I mean better than probably you or I would have figured out,
but

2223
02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:52.540
many ways it was the highest point of sewage management.

2224
02:07:52.541 --> 02:07:55.900
That's really interesting.
And other public works in the ancient world,

2225
02:07:57.070 --> 02:08:00.940
famous for public baths in latrines with quite complex engineering.

2226
02:08:00.941 --> 02:08:02.110
Rome also excelled,

2227
02:08:02.290 --> 02:08:07.290
excelled in the use of covered drains for storm water and sewage with some

2228
02:08:07.331 --> 02:08:10.990
houses connected directly to the drainage system.
So if you're rich,

2229
02:08:11.230 --> 02:08:12.700
you get shit in that river hole.

2230
02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:16.810
He had a whole and just drop a Dukie and a flow away.

2231
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:20.890
Wow.
Yeah.
They tried.
They tried to figure it out.

2232
02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:23.830
Even if they were the best added at the time,

2233
02:08:23.831 --> 02:08:27.340
it probably still was one of the worst smells ever.
Well,

2234
02:08:27.341 --> 02:08:29.830
think about how long Rome was around too.
I mean,

2235
02:08:29.831 --> 02:08:33.610
how long was roam around before shit went bad and the calcium fell apart and it

2236
02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:38.560
became what it is now.
I mean,
the Rome,
Rome,
the old days,
the coliseum run,

2237
02:08:38.561 --> 02:08:42.000
we think of wrong.
We think of the Roman empire like no,

2238
02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:46.240
they probably rocked it for several hundred years,
you know,
many,
many,
many years.

2239
02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:49.720
I think that a good 500 year run,
maybe let's find out.

2240
02:08:49.870 --> 02:08:54.460
I would say maybe a thousand.
How long was the Roman Empire?
How long?

2241
02:08:54.610 --> 02:08:57.670
I thought that's kind of where the saying there is no thousand your empire came

2242
02:08:57.671 --> 02:09:01.370
from.
You might,
maybe it was just short of a thousand.
Maybe that's why I paused.

2243
02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:02.530
I could be way off.

2244
02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:05.530
<v 2>It seems like plausible Rome,
you know,</v>

2245
02:09:05.531 --> 02:09:07.240
when you think about our history and how many,

2246
02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:08.150
<v 3>yeah,</v>

2247
02:09:08.150 --> 02:09:12.770
<v 0>stages of it.
Rome played into the,
yeah,
well definitely a few hundred years.</v>

2248
02:09:12.771 --> 02:09:17.010
Right.
But if you look at it like United States,
we've had a pretty good God.

2249
02:09:17.011 --> 02:09:19.160
Damn you are working on to 50.
Yeah.

2250
02:09:19.190 --> 02:09:22.550
And from the time we were really running shaman a thousand is plausible.

2251
02:09:22.551 --> 02:09:25.460
I just automatically in my brain I know that saying and I was like,

2252
02:09:25.461 --> 02:09:26.600
maybe that's why that's there.

2253
02:09:26.630 --> 02:09:29.180
This is too hard to figure out while also doing a podcast,

2254
02:09:29.181 --> 02:09:33.200
but it looks like several hundred at at the very least.
It's hard to,

2255
02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:38.270
it's hard to tell how many Caesar's,
you know,
a gang of these mother fuckers.

2256
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:43.010
You know,
that's one of the things that I love about uh,
this uh,

2257
02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:45.830
game of Thrones show as you really get a chance to say,

2258
02:09:45.850 --> 02:09:48.470
besides all the fantasy stuff and dragons and shit,

2259
02:09:48.710 --> 02:09:51.860
you really get a chance to see what it must've been like back then when there

2260
02:09:51.861 --> 02:09:56.861
were real kings that actually fucked and killed pink bowl.

2261
02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:57.130
And the

2262
02:09:57.130 --> 02:09:59.980
<v 2>fact that kings were also not,
they weren't kings of countries.</v>

2263
02:09:59.981 --> 02:10:01.810
They were like basically like kings counties.

2264
02:10:02.230 --> 02:10:05.560
When you look at it like they had their spot and they had all the land around

2265
02:10:05.561 --> 02:10:05.930
them and they,

2266
02:10:05.930 --> 02:10:09.340
those people work for them on their land and they took care of those people and

2267
02:10:09.341 --> 02:10:12.670
that's,
they were the king of those people.
The king in the north.
So like,

2268
02:10:12.671 --> 02:10:12.821
you know,

2269
02:10:12.821 --> 02:10:17.380
they could be like the king of Van Eyes and the king of Woodland Hills King of

2270
02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:20.740
receipts.
Especially when you're on horses,
right?

2271
02:10:21.310 --> 02:10:23.650
You could be king of thousand oaks.
It's just too far.

2272
02:10:23.890 --> 02:10:26.650
Where are you going to get it?
All the way up to thousand oaks run shit,
come on.

2273
02:10:26.651 --> 02:10:28.570
So I was already a king in thousand oaks.

2274
02:10:28.571 --> 02:10:31.990
Don't you know that if there's any king out there is going to go to bat with the

2275
02:10:31.991 --> 02:10:34.190
King of Auction Oxnard King of auction artist Piss

2276
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:37.850
<v 1>the king of thousand oaks.
You don't fuck with that.
Simi Valley King Man King,</v>

2277
02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:43.570
their ranch king's it live as King Arthur May.

2278
02:10:43.571 --> 02:10:46.430
No kings were like just dirty mother landlords,
man.
That's all they were.

2279
02:10:46.431 --> 02:10:48.350
It was fucking apartment like slum lord owners.

2280
02:10:48.351 --> 02:10:50.480
That's what kings were mostly for the most part.
Well,

2281
02:10:50.481 --> 02:10:52.540
you could usurp it king too,
right?
You could like,

2282
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:54.410
that's the whole thing about Conan the barbarian.

2283
02:10:54.411 --> 02:10:55.640
I think that's all that goes on and on.

2284
02:10:55.641 --> 02:11:00.050
Game of Thrones is the usurping of kings that Conan the barbarian shit was all

2285
02:11:00.051 --> 02:11:00.470
about you.

2286
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:04.250
Surfing is all about this book or something was called cone and the usurper.

2287
02:11:04.251 --> 02:11:07.970
Exactly.
One of the,
one of the first books.
Yeah.
Books.
We're talking books,
man.

2288
02:11:07.971 --> 02:11:09.080
We're not talking about movies.

2289
02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:13.330
<v 0>Robert E.
Howard.
Folks,
you want to talk about a tortured dude.
There was a,</v>

2290
02:11:13.331 --> 02:11:16.030
that was a tortured dude wind up blowing his fucking brains out.

2291
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:19.120
Just a live with his mom,
I think to the day he died.

2292
02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:23.890
He was in his thirties massively depressed.
It was like I'm Outta here.
Boom.

2293
02:11:23.950 --> 02:11:27.390
At Kone and was probably this whole universe.
Well,
the writing of Conan,

2294
02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:30.820
certainly what?
I mean,
he,
he had a lot of health issues that dude,
and I think,

2295
02:11:30.821 --> 02:11:31.061
you know,

2296
02:11:31.061 --> 02:11:36.061
he really romanticized and felt connected to this idea of this unbelievably veer

2297
02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:39.880
aisle and Alpha fucking Predator man.

2298
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:44.230
We're cut his path through this ancient world with a sword and fucking stood up

2299
02:11:44.231 --> 02:11:48.810
to sorcerers his shit and cut their fucking [inaudible] exactly.

2300
02:11:48.811 --> 02:11:51.730
I wanted to be in and when he knew it wasn't happening,
he's like,
all right,

2301
02:11:51.731 --> 02:11:55.090
I wrote enough,
boom,
see ya.

2302
02:11:55.670 --> 02:11:58.280
<v 1>Hey man,
you know some people,
you know,
it's weird.</v>

2303
02:11:58.281 --> 02:12:01.190
It's like sometimes we look on that is like tragic,

2304
02:12:01.191 --> 02:12:05.120
but then like you look at it like I was watching the um,
uh,
buy a ticket,

2305
02:12:05.121 --> 02:12:09.410
take the ride the other day I was just about to add it up and a,
and how like we,

2306
02:12:09.411 --> 02:12:12.610
you know,
so much,
it's so tragic.
But like for somehow,
you know,
we look at,
at,

2307
02:12:12.611 --> 02:12:14.960
at hunter and we say like,
you know,
when he made his choice,
man,

2308
02:12:14.961 --> 02:12:17.990
and that's what his choice was,
you know,
and he lived a long life and it's like,

2309
02:12:17.991 --> 02:12:20.660
why?
Why can't that guy,
I haven't been there.
Why hasn't he white your,
hey,

2310
02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:23.300
why does it have to be try?
Maybe he just decided,
yeah,

2311
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:27.180
it's from the livings perspective.
I understand why we all look at it that way.

2312
02:12:27.181 --> 02:12:30.440
Like,
oh no,
that's the last thing we ever want,
but hey,
maybe that guy,

2313
02:12:30.441 --> 02:12:31.850
you're right.
Maybe he just said like,
you know what,

2314
02:12:31.851 --> 02:12:36.430
I'm never going to be fucking Conan.
Yeah.

2315
02:12:36.500 --> 02:12:38.960
And just was like,
you know,
and if he,
I'm not aware of his story,

2316
02:12:38.961 --> 02:12:42.500
but if he was health problems they had was written with health problems and all

2317
02:12:42.501 --> 02:12:46.550
that stuff.
Hey fuck yeah man.
I'm a I,
I think doctor working and was a hero.

2318
02:12:46.580 --> 02:12:47.413
I'm one of those guys.

2319
02:12:47.930 --> 02:12:50.300
<v 0>I'm with you.
I think people,
if people are suffering,</v>

2320
02:12:50.301 --> 02:12:52.160
especially if people are in the last days of life,

2321
02:12:52.161 --> 02:12:53.390
there's nothing can bring them back.

2322
02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:58.430
I mean in most countries in the world have not,
most countries,
but many,

2323
02:12:58.610 --> 02:13:03.410
many advanced countries have doctors that can do things like that and they can

2324
02:13:03.411 --> 02:13:06.350
help people.
Am I talking on my ass?
I believe that's true.

2325
02:13:06.380 --> 02:13:09.560
I think assisted suicide is more common in other parts of the world.
Watched her.

2326
02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:12.650
I watched a thing on it.
Assisted suicide throughout the world.

2327
02:13:13.570 --> 02:13:14.130
<v 12>Okay.</v>

2328
02:13:14.130 --> 02:13:17.730
<v 1>It was a crazy little two man thing.
I think it came from a place,
it was on Hbo.</v>

2329
02:13:17.731 --> 02:13:19.110
It was Samuel L.
Jackson.

2330
02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:21.273
<v 12>Uh,</v>

2331
02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:25.230
<v 1>my wife just texted me.

Tell Jack.</v>

2332
02:13:25.231 --> 02:13:29.490
Thank you for it.
Yeah,
I
thank all of you.
Not just Joe.

2333
02:13:29.491 --> 02:13:33.090
Thank all of you.
All of you.
You don't know.
I mean I can't,
I can never,

2334
02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:36.060
as a parent of a,
of a child with cystic fibrosis,

2335
02:13:36.061 --> 02:13:39.350
I can never express the gratitude that's in my heart for what,

2336
02:13:39.351 --> 02:13:43.440
what everybody has done.
Sophie,
even up to now,
if nobody did anything.
Again,

2337
02:13:43.950 --> 02:13:47.550
people who have stepped up in ways that I never imagined in my life and,

2338
02:13:47.630 --> 02:13:51.630
and the strangers and friends.
So thanks to all of you.
I've,

2339
02:13:51.631 --> 02:13:53.070
it's changed me as a person.

2340
02:13:53.130 --> 02:13:56.430
It made me look at things differently when a more grateful sense of life and

2341
02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:58.050
when you can get caught up,

2342
02:13:58.290 --> 02:14:00.900
when you have a child with these kind of problems in a,
in a very,

2343
02:14:01.230 --> 02:14:04.020
you can easily get caught in a downward spiral and you know what I mean?

2344
02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:07.470
And people are what keep you out of that beautiful mine.
It is.

2345
02:14:07.471 --> 02:14:11.100
It is nice when you find out that the world isn't just filled with shit heads

2346
02:14:11.130 --> 02:14:15.180
there and I,
it really isn't and but they want to convince us all that it is.

2347
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:15.751
You know,

2348
02:14:15.751 --> 02:14:18.630
just like they want us all to be afraid of the guy with the gun outside.

2349
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:19.741
You know,

2350
02:14:19.741 --> 02:14:22.740
every time you turn on the news it's the same with like people are good,

2351
02:14:22.741 --> 02:14:26.340
people want to be good for the most part.
I believe that and I always will.

2352
02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:30.450
There's a lot of them,
that's for sure.
Are there a lot of assholes to,
sure,
sure.

2353
02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:35.100
But you know that Joe Rogan and his and his peoples have shown me that there's a

2354
02:14:35.101 --> 02:14:36.630
better way to react to those people.

2355
02:14:37.190 --> 02:14:41.370
There's a way that you can get through this life where you have the least amount

2356
02:14:41.371 --> 02:14:45.510
of conflict and that's the way that you should choose.
And I've,
I've done both.

2357
02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:49.320
I've been involved in a lot of conflicts and I've been involved in a little

2358
02:14:49.321 --> 02:14:52.200
conflict and the little is way better,
way better.
It's way,

2359
02:14:52.201 --> 02:14:57.200
way easier to get mine.
Usually you get old enough,
you figure that out.
It's also,

2360
02:14:57.820 --> 02:15:02.340
you realize like how you become more sensitive to how bad it feels when you do

2361
02:15:02.341 --> 02:15:04.740
get involved in conflict,
that you could have avoided that,

2362
02:15:05.070 --> 02:15:08.730
that feeling of having done something stupid and avoidable,

2363
02:15:08.910 --> 02:15:11.280
that gnawing feeling in the back of your brain,

2364
02:15:11.310 --> 02:15:13.260
that's not a good feeling to have.
Not at all.

2365
02:15:13.790 --> 02:15:17.580
And then there's the occasion when you may hurt somebody or whether it be

2366
02:15:17.610 --> 02:15:19.070
physically,
mentally,
whatever.
You know,

2367
02:15:19.380 --> 02:15:23.760
I have it as much as big of a dick as I've been in my life at times.

2368
02:15:23.761 --> 02:15:28.560
I'd have this big heart that has a lot of,
I can feel even for a guy I hate,

2369
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:31.980
I can feel,
you know what I mean?
Like,
Oh man,
that's a,

2370
02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:34.650
I still wish I didn't punch him in his face or it didn't do that.

2371
02:15:34.651 --> 02:15:39.510
Whatever that was.
And I mean,
so I know what you mean.
You know,
the older I get,

2372
02:15:39.511 --> 02:15:42.420
the more the kids did a lot of that for me to,
you know,
seeing like,

2373
02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:44.610
um,

2374
02:15:44.910 --> 02:15:48.060
minor things happen where I'd get a little upset and see how it would affect my

2375
02:15:48.061 --> 02:15:50.960
child.
Like,
oh my God,
I can't let this affect my child.
You know what,

2376
02:15:51.010 --> 02:15:53.430
I got to learn how to,
to process things differently.

2377
02:15:53.790 --> 02:15:56.820
And that's a big difference in the amount of patients that you need when you

2378
02:15:56.821 --> 02:16:00.960
raise the child.
And the way I also started looking at everybody as a baby.

2379
02:16:01.710 --> 02:16:04.710
That's the one of the weird things that happened when I started raising babies

2380
02:16:04.770 --> 02:16:07.170
from a baby to a person.
I'd met babies before,

2381
02:16:07.171 --> 02:16:12.150
but I'd never been there from the jump.
You know,
I never seen the whole process.

2382
02:16:12.151 --> 02:16:13.410
And when you see the whole process,

2383
02:16:13.411 --> 02:16:17.910
there's some weird recognition that happened in my brain where everyone that I

2384
02:16:17.911 --> 02:16:22.120
saw everywhere in life,
what no matter how fucked up they are.

2385
02:16:22.121 --> 02:16:25.410
And no matter how I recognize them as an originally a baby,

2386
02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:30.230
like homeless people freaked me out because of that.
It doesn't necessarily freak

2387
02:16:30.230 --> 02:16:33.120
<v 0>me out because,
uh,
you know,
I feel like I should save them or I,</v>

2388
02:16:33.130 --> 02:16:37.090
I accept their fate.
I,
you know,
accept the fact there's just too many people to,

2389
02:16:37.590 --> 02:16:40.750
to fix.
But I also see them as babies.

2390
02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:45.250
I see them as babies that just got a shit roll the dice,
terrible parents,

2391
02:16:45.370 --> 02:16:49.390
bad circumstance,
and then everything else that comes after that,

2392
02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:50.920
which led them to this position,

2393
02:16:50.921 --> 02:16:54.910
whether it's insanity or whether it's a drug addiction or whatever the fuck it

2394
02:16:54.911 --> 02:16:55.421
is,
crying,

2395
02:16:55.421 --> 02:16:58.630
whatever it is that brought them to the place where you find them now they

2396
02:16:58.631 --> 02:17:02.200
started out as babies.
That's a real mind fuck.
And when I,

2397
02:17:02.290 --> 02:17:04.720
when I applied that mind fuck to human beings,

2398
02:17:04.721 --> 02:17:08.500
I have way more compassionate to people or force going to be stuck in my head

2399
02:17:08.501 --> 02:17:12.250
now.
It really changed my world,
man changed my world.

2400
02:17:12.670 --> 02:17:15.940
I really did,
really was a paradigm shift.
I mean,

2401
02:17:15.941 --> 02:17:18.730
it's not that I'm always completely consistent with it.
You know,

2402
02:17:18.731 --> 02:17:22.900
I think all of us are dealing with a bunch of different pressures and stresses

2403
02:17:22.901 --> 02:17:26.460
and you can catch someone one day like I have,

2404
02:17:26.470 --> 02:17:29.740
I have friends that are like always jovial and great to be around and he catch

2405
02:17:29.741 --> 02:17:34.741
dude the wrong day and everything is just short and can't handle this and just

2406
02:17:35.471 --> 02:17:38.200
fucking,
I gotta get Outta here.
And then you see him the next day.

2407
02:17:38.201 --> 02:17:40.690
Oh sorry about yesterday man.
I,
you know,
I'm fucking,

2408
02:17:40.691 --> 02:17:44.470
I just quit smoke cigarettes or I lost my dog,
or whatever it is.

2409
02:17:44.471 --> 02:17:47.260
You catch them in that bad spot where they're just got this.

2410
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:51.820
But for the most part,
I think we,
we,
we're,

2411
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:57.150
we're dealing with people today that know the benefits of being nice more than

2412
02:17:58.391 --> 02:18:00.910
anybody that's ever known it more than anybody ever.

2413
02:18:00.911 --> 02:18:05.410
Because the only people that you had in your life like a hundred years ago where

2414
02:18:05.411 --> 02:18:07.270
the people that were in your life physically,

2415
02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:10.000
there was very few representations of,

2416
02:18:10.030 --> 02:18:13.450
of life outside of the people that you got in contact with.

2417
02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:16.450
You can read some books,
but you really couldn't talk to those dudes.

2418
02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:18.850
You can kind of get a sense of how they were living their life.

2419
02:18:18.970 --> 02:18:20.620
But what did you see in front of you?
Well,

2420
02:18:20.621 --> 02:18:24.520
that's what you're going to base your shit on.
Not Today,
man.
I today,

2421
02:18:24.521 --> 02:18:26.620
today it's a totally different world today.

2422
02:18:26.860 --> 02:18:31.750
A dude could listen to Everlast talk on a podcast about life and then

2423
02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:37.500
contemplate that shit for the rest of his day and then tomorrow wake up with

2424
02:18:38.171 --> 02:18:42.160
this new way of looking at the world because they've just been thinking about

2425
02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:45.400
something that you said that like,
God dammit,
he's got a fucking point.

2426
02:18:45.430 --> 02:18:49.660
If I just did that,
maybe I would be happier if I just did that.

2427
02:18:49.780 --> 02:18:52.000
Maybe life would be better if I just did that.

2428
02:18:52.001 --> 02:18:57.001
Maybe I would get a better handle on who the fuck I am and that's never existed

2429
02:18:57.161 --> 02:18:59.800
before.
It's never been possible before.
That happened for me here.

2430
02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:02.190
One of the few things,
one,
I want raise,

2431
02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:05.770
I dig talking to you and hanging out with you so much cause I get that happens

2432
02:19:05.771 --> 02:19:09.670
to me here.
I'd say at least every other time I'll leave here with something.

2433
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:12.580
We may not be earth shattering,
life changing,

2434
02:19:12.581 --> 02:19:15.640
but it will be something that I'll be able to chew on for a while.

2435
02:19:15.790 --> 02:19:17.950
You know what I mean?
Well,
that's what we get those,

2436
02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:21.250
we get those from talking to each other and we get those from people that we

2437
02:19:21.251 --> 02:19:22.750
also know our thinking about shit.

2438
02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:25.210
Like you're thinking about shit live in as you,

2439
02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:28.700
I'm thinking about shit living as me.
We come together and then you,

2440
02:19:28.701 --> 02:19:32.090
you say something like,
Oh okay,
I see what it just motherfuckers calling from.

2441
02:19:32.450 --> 02:19:36.080
Oh yeah.
Wow.
And then you know,

2442
02:19:36.081 --> 02:19:38.750
maybe you'll influence something that uh,
you know,

2443
02:19:39.100 --> 02:19:43.940
add to an idea that I had had or add to a thought that I was working on and then

2444
02:19:43.941 --> 02:19:47.120
someone else to come in next week and they'll say something crazy to,

2445
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:48.500
and then that adds to it too.

2446
02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:51.980
And then you repeat it on the podcast and people start tweeting it and then it

2447
02:19:51.981 --> 02:19:55.340
becomes a thought that gets shared with who knows how many people thought

2448
02:19:55.341 --> 02:19:57.980
hundreds of thousands.
It's crazy.

2449
02:19:58.180 --> 02:20:03.080
It's almost just really had a vision of like the entire human race as a brain

2450
02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:06.560
and that being that what you're saying being like a thought,

2451
02:20:06.620 --> 02:20:10.370
starting to travel through it,
what kind of is in a lot of ways,
I mean it's,

2452
02:20:10.371 --> 02:20:14.960
it's not not a brain necessarily,
but a system,
an organized system of thinking.

2453
02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:18.380
That's what I mean.
What'd you say?
Operating system,

2454
02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:20.570
since it's sort of said similar,

2455
02:20:20.571 --> 02:20:24.770
but more so an organism than an operating system because an operating system can

2456
02:20:24.771 --> 02:20:28.400
be dormant.
You could just shut it off and it sits there.
This thing is a system.

2457
02:20:28.401 --> 02:20:33.260
It's a living thinking system and that's why when I say like people that think

2458
02:20:33.261 --> 02:20:37.280
that the federal government has a handle on things that nobody's got a handle on

2459
02:20:37.281 --> 02:20:40.130
this,
this is out of everyone's control.
Well,

2460
02:20:40.131 --> 02:20:43.910
you're dealing with right now is massively accelerated human evolution,

2461
02:20:44.150 --> 02:20:47.660
human evolution of thinking and culture that's going on in an unprecedented

2462
02:20:47.661 --> 02:20:52.130
scale so fast that we can't recognize it while it's happening to us and at the

2463
02:20:52.131 --> 02:20:52.964
same time,

2464
02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:57.710
technology is moving in this impossible to catch direction.

2465
02:20:57.890 --> 02:21:00.020
It's out of everyone's hand now.

2466
02:21:00.021 --> 02:21:04.430
It's growing itself and unless we get hit by an asteroid or Yellowstone blows or

2467
02:21:04.431 --> 02:21:07.580
something,
something that wipes out most of the people on the planet,

2468
02:21:07.581 --> 02:21:10.730
we have to start with the cast of swamp people.
You know,

2469
02:21:10.820 --> 02:21:14.150
the cast of those gator hunters from swamp people,
them and the narrator,

2470
02:21:14.190 --> 02:21:16.550
they're the only people left in life.
Unless that happens,

2471
02:21:16.551 --> 02:21:19.430
lifts something that fucking catastrophic happens.
I could live in that world.

2472
02:21:19.630 --> 02:21:23.540
Do you live in the spot?
I could live in that world when I go watch swampy,

2473
02:21:23.541 --> 02:21:26.090
but I think,
which I like those.
Which of those women I would fuck

2474
02:21:26.820 --> 02:21:28.220
<v 2>I was after a while.
All of them.</v>

2475
02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:33.240
<v 0>But those,
those swap women,</v>

2476
02:21:33.390 --> 02:21:36.150
they need fucking subtitles and they're speaking English.

2477
02:21:36.300 --> 02:21:40.590
They're living in America speaking English and everything they say has
subtitles.

2478
02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:43.970
<v 2>Yeah.
The king of the swamp has always got two subtitles.</v>

2479
02:21:44.230 --> 02:21:47.620
That creole accent thing going on this,
because there is,

2480
02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:52.230
it's like the creole thing is,
is a whole different world down there,
man.

2481
02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:53.880
The real deal,
you're,
I mean,

2482
02:21:53.881 --> 02:21:56.640
when you get back in those people that when you live back in them woods,

2483
02:21:57.450 --> 02:21:59.700
it's a different life.
Yeah.
That French thing.

2484
02:22:00.190 --> 02:22:04.390
<v 0>What was that fucking movie?
There was a movie where a bunch of dudes,</v>

2485
02:22:05.170 --> 02:22:07.900

Brian helped me on this.
There was a movie,

2486
02:22:08.250 --> 02:22:13.120
God damn it was it Burt Reynolds was it,
it wasn't deliverance was deliverance.

2487
02:22:13.150 --> 02:22:13.870
No,

2488
02:22:13.870 --> 02:22:18.870
There was a movie about creels and dudes that got crazy and shot at some do.

2489
02:22:21.371 --> 02:22:26.040
They thought it was fun and they shot at some dude in the swamp.
And

2490
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:29.880
<v 1>then the,
those people started hunting them.

Yes.
Yeah.

2493
02:22:35.171 --> 02:22:37.630
I can't remember the name of this.
I know the movie you're talking about.
Ah,

2494
02:22:37.870 --> 02:22:40.750
they were,
they were reserves.
They were reserves.
Army reserves.

2495
02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:44.200
They were training in the,
in the Louisiana swamp.
And they took a shot at,

2496
02:22:44.201 --> 02:22:48.400
so I remember that movie.
Yes,

Oh,

Wheat.

2497
02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:52.270
The name of that fucking movie.

2498
02:22:52.430 --> 02:22:57.390

That's gonna make me crazy.
I guarantee you we will get that.
Jane.

2499
02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:02.020
I can see him with the southern comfort.
God.
Damn.

2500
02:23:02.021 --> 02:23:06.860
That's a good movie.
Netflix in that bitch.
I am too.

2501
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:11.980
That got me scared as fuck those fucking Badass hillbillies.
Yeah.

2502
02:23:11.981 --> 02:23:14.890
You don't fuck around and that's like a dumb hillbillies man.

2503
02:23:15.100 --> 02:23:17.080
1981 that made me think of that.

2504
02:23:17.081 --> 02:23:21.200
Patrick Patrick Swayze movie with the hillbillies.
It's only got a 7.2

2505
02:23:21.260 --> 02:23:24.910
<v 1>on the IMD be.
How dare you.
That was greatness.
That was a good move.</v>

2506
02:23:24.911 --> 02:23:28.910
It's a Walter Hill movie.
Oh Shit.
That's incredible.

2507
02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:33.650
I didn't know that was a Walton real movie.
Holy Shit.
Wow.

2508
02:23:33.651 --> 02:23:37.280
Walter Hill did aliens,
right?
I thought aliens.

2509
02:23:37.950 --> 02:23:40.850
That's ready to least Scott Scott in it.

2510
02:23:41.060 --> 02:23:45.680
I think he was involved in it somehow.
Yes.
Yes.
Was He,

2511
02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:50.550
does it say aliens?
Maybe a producer or something like that.

2512
02:23:50.990 --> 02:23:54.740
Aliens was John Carpenter,
right?
Didn't John Carpenter direct it?

2513
02:23:55.010 --> 02:23:59.480
I thought it was really Scott daily yen.
Oh,
aliens.
You're talking about.

2514
02:23:59.710 --> 02:24:02.180
Is that the second one?
I don't know.

2515
02:24:02.690 --> 02:24:07.280
It was originally meant to direct alien.
He was originally meant to direct alien,

2516
02:24:07.281 --> 02:24:12.230
but he didn't.
He's a producer and alien is he?
Yeah.
Okay,
but you don't really,

2517
02:24:12.231 --> 02:24:15.470
Scott did direct the aliens.
He also thought he did the first two.

2518
02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:19.460
He also did a hard times with Charles Bronson son.

2519
02:24:20.060 --> 02:24:24.290
That's a strong movie.
Did he produce it or directly?
I don't know what he did,

2520
02:24:24.380 --> 02:24:27.680
but he worked with,
uh,
Charles Bronson on hard times.
Just says it.

2521
02:24:27.681 --> 02:24:30.980
Here is a quote where he's talking about working with Charles Bronson.

2522
02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:37.340
Oh,
I see.
There's a list of,
maybe he's directed,
but yeah,

Mickey Rourke Warrior Forum,
Dude.
They rob banks or something like that.
Oh,

2526
02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:53.810
I'm not paying,
I think it was banks.
They robbed.

2527
02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:59.670
Wow.
So Southern Comfort,

I remember as soon as,
oh,

2528
02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:04.210
I know what you're talking about.
That's a good drink to drink.
Train.

2529
02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:09.860
I drink wild Turkey.
I've been doing shots,
a wild Turkey lately.

2530
02:25:09.890 --> 02:25:13.190
Turkey and a little too much,
man.
I'm a Jack Daniels guy.

2531
02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:16.190
That's like Jack Daniels on steroids.
No,
and that's what happened to me.

2532
02:25:16.191 --> 02:25:17.710
I got so sick with Jack Daniels,

2533
02:25:17.711 --> 02:25:21.050
so I switched to Turkey and almost killed me because it's one a one at most bars

2534
02:25:21.051 --> 02:25:24.160
too,
because they always have the one on one.
That shit's very,
very,

2535
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:27.880
<v 0>very strong.
Yeah.
Keith Carradine powers booth,</v>

2536
02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:30.670
remember powers booth and Fred Ward,

2537
02:25:30.671 --> 02:25:33.310
son Reema Williams,

2538
02:25:33.311 --> 02:25:36.930
whatever happened to Raymond Williams did the adventure begins Reema Williams is

2539
02:25:36.931 --> 02:25:41.810
never continued to Koreans got a big boost because of a Reema Williams.

2540
02:25:41.811 --> 02:25:46.420
So little man was the man.
He was the man.
He did fuck people up.

2541
02:25:46.421 --> 02:25:50.570
But its fingertips,
that whole thing on the statue of Liberty.
Yeah.

2542
02:25:50.571 --> 02:25:55.571
Then a squad of National Guard in an isolated Louisiana swamp must fight for

2543
02:25:55.631 --> 02:25:56.890
their lives when they're,

2544
02:25:57.160 --> 02:26:00.640
when the angle local Cajuns by stealing their canoes.

2545
02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:05.230
Oh that's what it was without.
They got separated or lost or something and they,

2546
02:26:05.470 --> 02:26:07.600
a certain group of them and they,
they did that.

2547
02:26:07.750 --> 02:26:09.080
They did shoot at somebody though.
They,

2548
02:26:09.081 --> 02:26:12.370
they shot somebody and one of them killed them.

2549
02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:15.670
One of them shot one of their boys and then it was on,

2550
02:26:16.270 --> 02:26:18.460
I remember that I was a good movie.
I remember liking him.

2551
02:26:18.470 --> 02:26:21.550
I was pretty young though.
I'm gonna rewatch it,
see if it holds up.

2552
02:26:21.910 --> 02:26:22.541
That was a very,

2553
02:26:22.541 --> 02:26:26.260
and then another fucking good movie that is kind of Cliche is deliverance and

2554
02:26:26.270 --> 02:26:30.610
other similar movie.
That's when Burt Reynolds was a bad motherfucker.

2555
02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:35.470
I put up a link on my Twitter the other day of a 70 year old bodybuilder.

2556
02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:40.480
Pull this fucking clip,
pull this clip.
You,

you won't believe this,
but just,

2557
02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:44.560
just do youtube 70 year old bodybuilder.
This black dude.

2558
02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:48.880
And all I could think of is I watched that show fast and loud.

2559
02:26:48.881 --> 02:26:53.130
You ever watch that show?
Fast and loud car guys,
they build cars and they,

2560
02:26:53.170 --> 02:26:56.320
the guy,
uh,
Bill Burr has a really funny bit of,
I don't know if it's a bit,

2561
02:26:56.321 --> 02:26:59.620
but he's,
he talks about it really funny.
They um,
they,

2562
02:26:59.650 --> 02:27:02.870
they're always like buying cars off people and then fixing them up and reselling

2563
02:27:02.890 --> 02:27:04.770
them.
And the guys always like,
uh,

2564
02:27:04.930 --> 02:27:09.300
how much you want for the car and the guy's like 5,005 now.

2565
02:27:09.310 --> 02:27:12.310
I was hoping you going to say too.
And then they,
they,
you know,
anyway,

2566
02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:15.310
they go and they build this a smokey and the bandit car.

2567
02:27:15.311 --> 02:27:16.870
One of those old school Trans Ams.

2568
02:27:17.170 --> 02:27:21.940
They go to visit Burt Reynolds at his home to get them to sign the car.
Dude,

2569
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:25.060
Burt Reynolds is only 78 years old.
Okay,

2570
02:27:25.061 --> 02:27:29.440
so he's only eight years older than this guy who's in this video lifting weights

2571
02:27:29.650 --> 02:27:31.690
and Burt Reynolds looks like he's dying.
Look at this guy.

2572
02:27:32.170 --> 02:27:35.140
This is mother fucker 70 backed that up,
backed it up.
Play that back again.

2573
02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:38.410
Hold on.
You got to see the beginning of it.
Look at this guy's body.

2574
02:27:38.710 --> 02:27:43.180
This motherfucker is 70 years old.
Are you shitting me?

2575
02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:44.620
He's doing dead lifts.

2576
02:27:44.770 --> 02:27:49.770
He's fucking 70 he's seven d seven zero mean his face looks kind of 70 ish.

2577
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:56.540
But God damn son,
that dude's chiseled.
I don't care if he's on three.

2578
02:27:56.680 --> 02:27:57.850
I put them 50 ish,

2579
02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:02.130
like a hard facts and a hardcore 52 like you're a bad motherfucker.

2580
02:28:03.220 --> 02:28:07.660
Meanwhile,
he's 70 wow.
Just swole to the gills.

2581
02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:11.230
Burt Reynolds is only eight years old in this guy and when Burt Reynolds was in

2582
02:28:11.231 --> 02:28:14.140
his driveway,
he looked so bad,

2583
02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:16.460
he was hunched over CV.

2584
02:28:16.461 --> 02:28:19.480
You could pull up Burt Reynolds on fast and loud,

2585
02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:23.420
see if there's a youtube clip of it online anywhere.
But it was so depressing,

2586
02:28:23.421 --> 02:28:27.440
man,
because I was a huge fan of Burt Reynolds would.
I was a kid.
He,
you know,

2587
02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:31.370
deliverance especially.
That was a fucking phenomenal movie.

2588
02:28:31.371 --> 02:28:35.900
That was his first roommate hooper.
That's right.
Of course smokey and the bandit.

2589
02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:37.700
Those were fun movies,
man.

2590
02:28:38.330 --> 02:28:41.960
When I found out that he was Sharkey's machine machine.
That's right.

2591
02:28:41.961 --> 02:28:43.130
Without Hot Italian bitch.

2592
02:28:43.131 --> 02:28:46.760
Who was that hot Italian benefit domino or something like that wasn't in her

2593
02:28:46.761 --> 02:28:50.560
name.
She's a prostitute.
He fell in love with and he was just a cop.
African.

2594
02:28:50.561 --> 02:28:54.710
I'm crazy shit.
You find it anywhere.

2595
02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:58.940
It's sad man.
Look at him.
There he is.

2596
02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:02.390
Back it up a little bit so he could see him.

2597
02:29:02.510 --> 02:29:06.050
I mean they didn't show too much of them I think because they were trying to not

2598
02:29:06.051 --> 02:29:09.230
depressed everybody,
but he's like got this cane and he's,

2599
02:29:10.130 --> 02:29:14.750
he looks so old,
man.
It's weird.
And they had them at the areas looking,

2600
02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:19.450

02:29:30.261 --> 02:29:32.690
He just got the shot of the day and uh,

2605
02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:37.970
<v 2>he got it in though,
Dude.
Yeah,
burn.
Got It in.
That's wear and tear.</v>

2606
02:29:37.971 --> 02:29:41.200
He put on those bones was a football player and he's young

2607
02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:45.300
<v 0>and uh,
I know he,
he has some serious back injury to right.</v>

2608
02:29:45.370 --> 02:29:46.980
Didn't he just got too many blow jobs?

2609
02:29:49.190 --> 02:29:51.740
<v 2>He's stuck in that curl.
The orgasm</v>

2610
02:29:54.330 --> 02:29:57.030
was pussy and cocaine at bodies.

2611
02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:00.410
Yeah.

2612
02:30:00.410 --> 02:30:04.550
<v 0>Oh,
he did?
Yeah.
He had some pretty serious back injuries in the two thousands.</v>

2613
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:10.710
Yeah.
Poor guy,
man.
It's,
it's hard.
It's hard.
Was trying to pick up Lani answers.

2614
02:30:10.711 --> 02:30:14.720
Just tidies that's heavy.
Wasn't that his chick for our low,

2615
02:30:14.820 --> 02:30:17.720
he had a pill addiction.
That's it.
That's where it is,
man.

2616
02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:22.920
That Shit will rob you of your fucking vitality quicker than anything.
Yeah,

2617
02:30:22.970 --> 02:30:26.570
he had back surgery and then he got addicted to pills after the back surgery.

2618
02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:30.260
Oh listen ladies and gentlemen,
if you can avoid it,

2619
02:30:30.261 --> 02:30:34.100
if there's any way to avoid it,
don't get your back operated on.

2620
02:30:34.190 --> 02:30:36.260
I mean sometimes you can have to do it,

2621
02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:40.160
but always do it and take it from me personally,

2622
02:30:40.430 --> 02:30:44.360
I was advised to get back surgery and I went against it and I don't have any

2623
02:30:44.361 --> 02:30:47.990
back pain anymore.
I cured it up,
totally numb fingers,

2624
02:30:47.991 --> 02:30:50.990
pain throughout my older nerve down through my elbow,
everything.

2625
02:30:51.230 --> 02:30:53.960
And I was seriously thinking about it.
Cause if they cut you,
you know,

2626
02:30:53.961 --> 02:30:56.930
you heal up in a couple of months,
whatever and you're,
you know,

2627
02:30:56.931 --> 02:30:59.510
you don't have any pain anymore.
All that numbness is gone.

2628
02:30:59.630 --> 02:31:00.960
The bulging discs is sticking out.

2629
02:31:01.310 --> 02:31:04.190
But there's other ways to go about some of them.
Not all of them,

2630
02:31:04.220 --> 02:31:06.260
but some of those injuries,
there's other ways to go about it.

2631
02:31:06.261 --> 02:31:10.010
But so many doctors want to cut you right away.
They just want to cut you.

2632
02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:13.760
And I know not everybody can go through all the shit that I went to rehab it.
Um,

2633
02:31:13.810 --> 02:31:17.960
I'm well aware that I have the kind of free time that allows me to seek out

2634
02:31:17.961 --> 02:31:20.010
different kinds of therapy.
You know,

2635
02:31:20.030 --> 02:31:24.420
go get traction and get one of those things in my house with a hang by my ankles

2636
02:31:24.421 --> 02:31:26.610
and hang by my neck from a doorway.

2637
02:31:27.540 --> 02:31:31.110
But when I see people that have had surgeries,
man,

2638
02:31:31.650 --> 02:31:35.220
it seems to work out bad so often,
so many.

2639
02:31:35.221 --> 02:31:38.160
And that obviously a back injury is fucking bad,
period.

2640
02:31:38.400 --> 02:31:42.240
If you got some shit with fucking with your spine,
that's not good period.

2641
02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:45.090
No matter what,
whether it's an injury or whether it's a surgery,

2642
02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:50.340
it's like that whole area is just so delicate going in there and cutting it.

2643
02:31:51.930 --> 02:31:55.050
And that's,
that was uh,
there was another recent article about pill addiction,

2644
02:31:55.290 --> 02:32:00.290
about how many people who go in for like some serious surgery and then get on

2645
02:32:01.111 --> 02:32:03.420
some pills because the doctor prescribes you form.

2646
02:32:03.540 --> 02:32:07.350
How many people have like real withdrawals,
super common.

2647
02:32:07.620 --> 02:32:11.220
Like re most people get through it,
but real common that they have a hard time.

2648
02:32:11.260 --> 02:32:14.500
<v 2>I'm not unsympathetic to that,
but it's also this,</v>

2649
02:32:14.650 --> 02:32:18.850
it's these people use the pills beyond the need for them.
All right.

2650
02:32:18.851 --> 02:32:23.590
Because I was on dilaudid,
which is like that drugstore cowboy.

2651
02:32:23.880 --> 02:32:26.380
Yeah.
They all freaked up.
That's the shit of all shit.

2652
02:32:26.381 --> 02:32:29.500
And I remember being in the hospital for my heart surgery afterwards and

2653
02:32:29.501 --> 02:32:31.710
learning,
I was on this mission,
they had me on this machine.

2654
02:32:31.750 --> 02:32:34.150
I could medicate myself every so often.

2655
02:32:34.660 --> 02:32:37.720
And your brain starts to hear when it clicks over that you can go like,

2656
02:32:37.721 --> 02:32:42.450
you know when you can hit it again and,
and I would,
you know what I mean?

2657
02:32:42.460 --> 02:32:44.910
It was fun.
It was unbelievable.
All right.

2658
02:32:45.160 --> 02:32:48.340
And then I remember asking what it was and drugstore cowboy happens to be one of

2659
02:32:48.341 --> 02:32:52.750
my favorite movies of all time.
So when they told me dilauded,
I was like,
Oh shit,

2660
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:55.490
fuck.
I'm like,
I'm fucked.
I'm,

2661
02:32:55.540 --> 02:32:59.080
I literally was like in the hospital thinking I'm fucked because this feels
good.

2662
02:32:59.081 --> 02:33:01.390
And I know as soon as I get out of here,
I'm gonna want more of this shit.

2663
02:33:01.980 --> 02:33:05.140
And I expressed the concern to the doctor and the doctor told me,
look,

2664
02:33:05.980 --> 02:33:10.980
as long as you're using pain medication to s to actually mask pain,

2665
02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:13.090
you can't get addicted to it.

2666
02:33:13.390 --> 02:33:17.470
It's the minute you use it and that pain isn't,

2667
02:33:17.620 --> 02:33:21.860
it's not to control the pain.
Like if you,
it's hard to explain what he'd doing,

2668
02:33:21.880 --> 02:33:22.181
he told me.

2669
02:33:22.181 --> 02:33:25.510
But that's basically the layman's terms of it is like as long as it's really

2670
02:33:25.511 --> 02:33:28.360
masking actual pain,
you're not going to get addicted to it.

2671
02:33:28.361 --> 02:33:30.940
It's when you like the pain gets a little less,
but you still think,
oh,

2672
02:33:30.941 --> 02:33:32.290
let me just take a little edge off it.

2673
02:33:32.291 --> 02:33:36.550
And you stay on that same strength painkiller instead of weaning yourself off.

2674
02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:39.360
Like,
that's why you should be monitored the whole time.

2675
02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:41.140
If you're taking pain medications,

2676
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:45.340
I don't believe in them sending you home with an army of fucking pills cause

2677
02:33:45.341 --> 02:33:46.450
nobody gets,
first of all,

2678
02:33:46.451 --> 02:33:49.110
you can mess up just in your sleep by if you had a little pain,

2679
02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:51.640
you took a pill earlier but you're a little loopy and you don't know you took

2680
02:33:51.641 --> 02:33:54.590
that pill and next thing you know you're taking three of them at night and you

2681
02:33:54.591 --> 02:33:57.490
know sometimes accidentally you get hooked on him.
But some people just say like,

2682
02:33:57.491 --> 02:34:00.490
these feels so good and I'm so comfortable on my fucking couch,

2683
02:34:00.910 --> 02:34:03.910
let me keep taking them because I got 30 extras that I don't need.

2684
02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:05.870
<v 0>Yeah.
You know what I mean?
They,
they,</v>

2685
02:34:05.871 --> 02:34:08.470
they're so quick to fucking pass those bitches out.
Oh yeah.

2686
02:34:08.540 --> 02:34:12.800
Some doctor's offices too.
I went to a great doctor for my nose.

2687
02:34:12.980 --> 02:34:17.740
I had a deviated septum repaired and I had no fucking pain when I'd tell you no

2688
02:34:17.741 --> 02:34:18.040
pain,

2689
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:21.460
<v 2>I'm not trying to be a tough guy.
And when it was over,
there was nothing like,</v>

2690
02:34:21.461 --> 02:34:24.160
I'm sure while he was cutting me,
if I was awake,

2691
02:34:24.161 --> 02:34:28.240
he would have hurt like fucking shit.
But after it was over,
there was not much.

2692
02:34:28.330 --> 02:34:30.760
It was a little swollen and weird,
but he came,

2693
02:34:30.761 --> 02:34:34.330
he too fucking painkiller prescriptions too for two different things.

2694
02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:37.910
I had my wisdom teeth pulled.
Same kind of thing.
Excellent doctor,
right?

2695
02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:42.250
He prescribed me like 60 vicodins.
The next day I was eating burritos.

2696
02:34:42.251 --> 02:34:45.010
It was like,
wow,
this is,
I was expecting this worst pain in my life.

2697
02:34:45.011 --> 02:34:46.750
Everybody told me it was going to be the worst thing ever.

2698
02:34:47.020 --> 02:34:48.670
The wisdom teeth getting pulled was I was,

2699
02:34:48.730 --> 02:34:52.960
I was prepared for hell and I woke up the next day.
It was like,
this is great.

2700
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:58.780
And I literally had those pills in my,
in my cabinet forever until I figured out,

2701
02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:03.940
and this was like 20 something years ago that a half a viking in an essay and a

2702
02:35:03.941 --> 02:35:06.670
glass of whiskey is a good time for a while.
You know what I mean?

2703
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:11.080
And so I came very close to becoming like kind of strung out there on pills.

2704
02:35:11.081 --> 02:35:14.170
And so I caught myself literally like,
wait a minute,
this is getting out of hand.

2705
02:35:14.171 --> 02:35:16.630
Um,
and I was able to just,
you know,
I was,
I,

2706
02:35:16.631 --> 02:35:18.130
I luckily have that kind of personality.

2707
02:35:18.131 --> 02:35:20.380
I've never been really super addictive personality,

2708
02:35:20.381 --> 02:35:23.920
so I've been able to recognize a few times when I got close to like this could

2709
02:35:23.921 --> 02:35:28.180
get out of hand.
Yeah.
Luckily man,
I tell people that I smoked crack once.

2710
02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:33.220
What was that like?
It was,
it was bananas.
It was like the craziest,

2711
02:35:33.221 --> 02:35:36.220
greatest rush for like 35,
40 seconds.

2712
02:35:36.730 --> 02:35:39.400
And then it was gone and it was like I wanted more.

2713
02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:43.030
And a guy I used to live with was a cracked,

2714
02:35:43.930 --> 02:35:47.500
I won't even call him his dealer,
a seller.
He just kind of sold it.

2715
02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:49.780
He wasn't even dealing,
cause he wasn't even doing very well with crack.

2716
02:35:49.781 --> 02:35:51.340
And that's uh,
you know,
I don't even understand.

2717
02:35:51.341 --> 02:35:55.240
But so like one night I was just kinda chipped off a piece and I smoked some

2718
02:35:55.241 --> 02:35:59.090
crack.
Man.
I was curious,
man.
But I recognized right away,
Yo,
I can,

2719
02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:02.980
I know why people lose their lives behind the shit.
And you smoke crack?
Yeah.

2720
02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:06.370
What was that like?
I didn't like it.
I thought it was just,

2721
02:36:06.371 --> 02:36:10.000
it smelled weird and smell is off putting.
Yeah,
it taste is not good.

2722
02:36:10.001 --> 02:36:12.430
But like the rush,
I got it from it.
I was like,
Whoa,

2723
02:36:12.460 --> 02:36:16.900
for like a few and literally 30 seconds and then it was Kinda like gone,

2724
02:36:16.901 --> 02:36:19.210
but you wanted it to happen again.
And I was just like,
Nah,

2725
02:36:19.211 --> 02:36:21.910
I ain't fucking go in there again man.
It was abd rather.

2726
02:36:21.930 --> 02:36:24.680
I remember thinking I'd rather do cocaine because had like took,

2727
02:36:24.910 --> 02:36:28.460
we took our cocaine and made crack and I forget how to do it.
Like baking soda.

2728
02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:33.490
Freebase freebasing let me crack is just like automatic,

2729
02:36:33.491 --> 02:36:37.160
like pre made freebase that's what crack is.
I free base.

2730
02:36:37.810 --> 02:36:40.060
What's the difference between crack and freebase?
Nothing.

2731
02:36:40.061 --> 02:36:43.270
It's just they figured out a better way to,
uh,
easier,

2732
02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:44.770
cheaper way to make the free base.

2733
02:36:44.771 --> 02:36:48.040
Like you had to have ether and all this other shit and I don't know,

2734
02:36:48.041 --> 02:36:50.860
was it freeway,
Rick Ross?
Have you ever had him in fuck yeah,

2735
02:36:50.861 --> 02:36:53.170
we had him on a couple of,
that's right.
I'm just going to say it sounds familiar.

2736
02:36:53.340 --> 02:36:53.540
Yeah.

2737
02:36:53.540 --> 02:36:57.220
I don't know if he's the guy who actually invented the way they make crack on

2738
02:36:57.221 --> 02:37:01.330
the stove,
but he's one of the early,
early pioneers of it.
Well,

2739
02:37:01.331 --> 02:37:05.200
he's certainly one of the early pioneers of the,
the business aspect of it.

2740
02:37:05.201 --> 02:37:08.470
Hell yeah.
Do it.
Talks about the money that he made during the glory days,

2741
02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:11.860
but he's total government isn't,
isn't doing that right Joe?

2742
02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:14.620
The government wouldn't have anything to do with that.

2743
02:37:14.621 --> 02:37:16.400
That's why the government was not involved

2744
02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:19.700
<v 1>in selling drugs in the inner cities of Los Angeles to find the contrast versus</v>

2745
02:37:19.701 --> 02:37:21.800
the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.

2746
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:25.340
They weren't doing that despite what Oliver North said,

2747
02:37:25.370 --> 02:37:29.000
Congress proved or who,
who,
who got po,

2748
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:31.880
how'd they find out that they were selling drugs?
It was,

2749
02:37:31.881 --> 02:37:35.570
it was all in that and Oliver North scandalous and evolved around that Easton

2750
02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:36.980
thing.
Yeah.
Was the guy,

2751
02:37:37.010 --> 02:37:41.180
Rick Ross was the fucking guy who is in charge of all that shit in Los Angeles

2752
02:37:41.210 --> 02:37:43.940
and well,
it's your audience.
So they already know.
I don't have to qualify that.

2753
02:37:43.941 --> 02:37:47.420
It's not the rapper who stole,
stole his identity.
Isn't that crazy?

2754
02:37:47.450 --> 02:37:51.050
It's crazy though.
50 cent did the same thing.
Just his,
his drug dealer's dead.

2755
02:37:52.060 --> 02:37:56.440
Yeah.
50 cent is a famous famous drug dealer in New York.
No,
she,
yes,

2756
02:37:56.570 --> 02:38:00.980
absolutely.
Yeah,
I think I did.
Yes.
No Shit.
Well,

2757
02:38:00.981 --> 02:38:05.270
Jay Z is a guy named Jasso Wright who was a jazz.
Oh.
Uh,

2758
02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:09.470
I think that was his partner.
Like there used to be a rapper jazz though,

2759
02:38:09.471 --> 02:38:13.160
and Jay z was his DJ way back in the day.
Oh,
see,

2760
02:38:13.220 --> 02:38:16.040
I had thought it was that jazz.
I don't know much about it.

2761
02:38:16.041 --> 02:38:18.120
If they were drug dealing and whatnot back then.
I don't,

2762
02:38:18.121 --> 02:38:20.780
I w I'm not hip to that part,
but they had a hit like jazz.
Oh.

2763
02:38:20.781 --> 02:38:24.190
Had a song way back called Hawaii,
Hawaiian Sophie Hawaiians.

2764
02:38:24.191 --> 02:38:27.230
It was like big at the time.
It was like for the era,
it was a hit for sure.

2765
02:38:27.530 --> 02:38:30.230
He was supposed to be a really good rapper.
He wasn't,
he's still probably is.

2766
02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:33.020
There's a lot of guys that have slipped through the cracks that people,

2767
02:38:33.860 --> 02:38:38.570
I mean rap,
I'm sure Jay even at this point would acknowledge that,
you know,

2768
02:38:38.571 --> 02:38:42.050
some of his beginnings come from Jazz.
Those styles of rap.

2769
02:38:42.500 --> 02:38:46.220
Well everybody gets influenced by somebody else.
Absolutely.
Everybody.
I mean,

2770
02:38:46.221 --> 02:38:49.970
I always give up the,
uh,
my,
my influences,

2771
02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:54.620
but Boston comedians Kennison like without all those people that I was as though

2772
02:38:54.621 --> 02:38:57.640
it's actually,
you know,
that song ain't no nothing like the one I got you.

2773
02:38:57.650 --> 02:39:00.530
Has he done?
He's sings,
I believe he's the guy singing in the hug.

2774
02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:04.520
No one can do it bad if he's not the guy actually singing it in the video.

2775
02:39:04.521 --> 02:39:09.020
That's him really a big daddy Kane.
He's still around,
man.

2776
02:39:09.021 --> 02:39:12.320
He's doing yo big daddy Kane ain't making records.
But I'll tell you like this,

2777
02:39:12.350 --> 02:39:13.460
as far as rap shows go,

2778
02:39:13.461 --> 02:39:16.310
I guarantee you he's still putting on one of the best rap shows around.

2779
02:39:17.450 --> 02:39:21.080
The old classics has all his classics,
but it's like he still has his dancers.

2780
02:39:21.081 --> 02:39:22.610
They have,
they do like a classic,

2781
02:39:22.611 --> 02:39:27.430
like I would call it like almost like a Vegas if there was a hip hop Vegas act

2782
02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:29.840
kind of thing.
It's kind of that,
but not cheesy in any way.

2783
02:39:29.841 --> 02:39:33.830
But like there's a classic classic quality and then a word to it,

2784
02:39:33.831 --> 02:39:38.150
like the two dancers.
It's like an era.
He represents it and it's a great show to,

2785
02:39:38.300 --> 02:39:41.680
how about EPMD?
That's another band you don't hear about anymore.
Yeah,

2786
02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:44.960
well they had a lot of internal problems and broke up and got back together and

2787
02:39:44.961 --> 02:39:49.460
broke up.
Yeah.
I liked EPMD first of all because whenever the dude,

2788
02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:54.620
amazing rapper and all sides of speech impediment and is a bad actor Everlyn

2789
02:39:54.830 --> 02:39:55.101
yeah,

2790
02:39:55.101 --> 02:40:00.101
he's got a list and just spitting dope rhymes with no apologies for his list,

2791
02:40:00.330 --> 02:40:02.530
you know,
you know,
and,
and it's good to,

2792
02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:06.770
well the first one to do that was Kool g rap.
Kool g rap was great.
Kool g rap.

2793
02:40:06.771 --> 02:40:10.340
He had the craziest boss and he had the craziest lists of all,

2794
02:40:10.350 --> 02:40:13.530
didn't really go to his office.
He had a crazy list.
Man.
Didn't know.

2795
02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:17.310
<v 4>Do you ever hear it?
Okay.
Michael Blue Blazers list.</v>

2796
02:40:17.490 --> 02:40:20.460
That's the best because it's,
everything was song.

2797
02:40:20.461 --> 02:40:25.410
He talks like this and Opie and Anthony poked down standards and stuff.

2798
02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:25.830
Yeah.

2799
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:29.680
<v 0>I have a really cool g rap.
Had a real pull up a cool job,</v>

2800
02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:34.650
pull up,
talk like sex,
pull up,
cock blocking.
That's one of my favorite ones.

2801
02:40:34.860 --> 02:40:39.840
Pull up Kool g rap cock block and he's got a great song about trying to bang

2802
02:40:39.841 --> 02:40:43.660
this chick and her son,
his cock blocking
all.

2803
02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:49.350
Also to remember that Dude Kool g rap was one of my favorites.

2804
02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:51.840
Something.
He just fell off.
I don't know what happened.

2805
02:40:52.290 --> 02:40:55.220
<v 2>Hey,
just,
you know,
it's like one of them things.
It's just,
it was an error in it,</v>

2806
02:40:55.250 --> 02:40:58.940
you know?
Yeah.
But he was hot.
It's like one of the,
it's a youth sport,

2807
02:40:58.970 --> 02:41:00.590
you know what I mean?
That's what I try and tell me.
Why didn't you do?

2808
02:41:00.591 --> 02:41:03.650
Why you ain't rapping like Qsu?
I still ride my putting it into my songs.

2809
02:41:03.651 --> 02:41:06.350
I'm working into what I do.
My,
my version of hip hop and stuff.

2810
02:41:06.351 --> 02:41:08.330
It's like but to chase the,

2811
02:41:08.510 --> 02:41:12.290
the adoration of the youth that buys hip hop right now as it was ridiculous for

2812
02:41:12.291 --> 02:41:17.291
me cause I'm a 44 year old man to Kool g rap and Dj Polo operations.

2813
02:41:17.591 --> 02:41:21.890
The song
it's called operations.

2814
02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:24.480
<v 4>Yeah.
That's your cost to USA operations.
CB.</v>

2815
02:41:25.710 --> 02:41:29.180
This action usually results in broken friendships.
The following

2816
02:41:29.300 --> 02:41:30.470
<v 10>cause this is where the essence</v>

2817
02:41:32.770 --> 02:41:37.640
I'm trying to get at.

2818
02:41:37.830 --> 02:41:38.663
It

2819
02:41:46.510 --> 02:41:49.280
brings back memories.
This is great.

2820
02:41:53.290 --> 02:41:55.970
Everything is going.
This is

2821
02:41:58.380 --> 02:41:59.213
crazy.

2822
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:04.740
This dude is like one of the revolutionaries of style

2823
02:42:04.870 --> 02:42:05.171
<v 2>rap.</v>

2824
02:42:05.171 --> 02:42:10.171
Like Kool g rap care is one in big daddy Kane really changed rap and Chuck d

2825
02:42:12.410 --> 02:42:17.310
those.
Cause before that it was like the run DMC [inaudible] pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,

2826
02:42:17.311 --> 02:42:20.590
a bias kind of just straight cadences.
And these guys all had different,

2827
02:42:20.620 --> 02:42:22.510
these different styles that they started working in.

2828
02:42:22.511 --> 02:42:26.020
And that's where a lot of everybody else started branching out and realizing

2829
02:42:26.021 --> 02:42:30.190
like there was more than one way to rhyme and one way to rap like Kool g rap,

2830
02:42:30.220 --> 02:42:34.300
big Daddy Kane,
krs one,
and Chuck d,
they,
they're the ones,

2831
02:42:34.301 --> 02:42:37.300
they're the forefathers of everything that goes on lyrically.
Now.

2832
02:42:37.710 --> 02:42:40.150
<v 0>I,
I agree and I feel like there's,</v>

2833
02:42:40.151 --> 02:42:44.950
there's something missing on a lot of people want to do this sort of,
uh,
this,

2834
02:42:45.010 --> 02:42:49.660
this hip hop hip hop has changed and a lot of ways today with is a lot of stuff

2835
02:42:49.661 --> 02:42:51.980
that they're calling hip hop that almost seems like dance music.

2836
02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:54.090
<v 2>Yes.
And that's what it is.
It's,
it's</v>

2837
02:42:56.130 --> 02:43:00.540
hip hop has been,
you know,
it's been opted man by their money.

2838
02:43:00.570 --> 02:43:01.860
You know what I mean?
The money there was,

2839
02:43:01.950 --> 02:43:04.260
there was money around back when these songs were being made,

2840
02:43:04.261 --> 02:43:09.120
but it wasn't ridiculous money that could,
it wasn't millions and billions.

2841
02:43:09.121 --> 02:43:10.080
It was thousands.

2842
02:43:10.110 --> 02:43:12.820
You know what I mean is like we were getting thousands of dollars back in the

2843
02:43:12.820 --> 02:43:16.630
day thinking like were bawling man.
I got a Nissan Sentra and a gold rope.

2844
02:43:16.640 --> 02:43:18.100
Motherfuckers for Shit you bought.

2845
02:43:18.270 --> 02:43:21.550
What's the first shit you bought when you started getting paid like a gold chain

2846
02:43:21.551 --> 02:43:26.551
from the Sloss and swap meet for text box for tick bomb.

2847
02:43:26.741 --> 02:43:31.070
What's that?
Remember the bongs,
the vortex bongs with that you had a tattoo.

2848
02:43:31.110 --> 02:43:35.460
The vortex clown graphics.
I'm sorry,
graphics.
There you go.

2849
02:43:36.090 --> 02:43:39.990
<v 0>Graphics clown is just a,
I still have that.
I drew that when I was like 21</v>

2850
02:43:40.270 --> 02:43:44.510
<v 2>yeah,
it reminds me of it.
It looks like Eddie.
It's so old now.</v>

2851
02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:47.120
It's fading like Eddie's face clown hat on.

2852
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:50.820
<v 0>I'm going to get Aaron Dellavedova to think finished the Musashi and fit it.</v>

2853
02:43:50.821 --> 02:43:52.470
Figure out what to put at the top of it.

2854
02:43:52.471 --> 02:43:54.270
He's the same guy has done both of my arms.

2855
02:43:54.510 --> 02:43:58.990
I just got to get this bitch lasered off.
It's dice light.
You can go over that.

2856
02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:03.600
Yeah.
I don't want it though.
He prefers not to.
Aaron likes to have a clean slate.

2857
02:44:03.601 --> 02:44:04.770
He's a perfectionist.

2858
02:44:04.771 --> 02:44:07.770
He doesn't like to have to draw some shit that he doesn't want to draw just

2859
02:44:07.771 --> 02:44:10.260
because there's some old ink there.
He's like,
it's no big deal.

2860
02:44:10.261 --> 02:44:12.360
Just get it lasered a couple of times.
He's like,
it's pretty old.

2861
02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:15.690
It'll get off pretty quick.
Then you wait three months and then get to work.

2862
02:44:15.720 --> 02:44:19.260
I just have to design or rather come up with the idea and send it to him.

2863
02:44:19.261 --> 02:44:19.501
Whatever.

2864
02:44:19.501 --> 02:44:22.950
My idea is and he'll design with a top is you got to figure out what to do.

2865
02:44:22.980 --> 02:44:25.620
Check out this,
this,
this is what opie and Anthony was talking about.

2866
02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:29.340
The Michael Bublé lists.
You can keep that fucking song on in the background.

2867
02:44:29.460 --> 02:44:32.020
Make bublé sound tolerable,
but it's,

2868
02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:35.873
<v 14>I got this lesson</v>

2869
02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.580
<v 9>right when he
does</v>

2870
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:55.590
that string around my,

2871
02:45:02.050 --> 02:45:04.240
<v 2>are we going to get pulled up youtube for this?
You know what?</v>

2872
02:45:04.270 --> 02:45:08.460
I think probably are we going to,
because we have that clip on there.
No,

2873
02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:12.340
it doesn't seem like no it does.
You know what I'm just thinking.

2874
02:45:12.341 --> 02:45:16.480
I think opie and Anthony got sent a fake audio file cause they like broke it

2875
02:45:16.481 --> 02:45:19.510
down and they have an always on the replay.
It's kind of

2876
02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:27.890
like sex.
I don't hear that.
That's weird.

2877
02:45:27.891 --> 02:45:31.210
You got to hear more of a song and I'm telling you the PM d but he made it.

2878
02:45:31.450 --> 02:45:36.230
You got to understand he made him and Eric sermon or comparable.
Yeah.
Wow.

2879
02:45:36.490 --> 02:45:37.323
That's interesting.

2880
02:45:37.510 --> 02:45:40.990
I think Eric sermon put it on a little bit more though because Kool g rap like I

2881
02:45:40.991 --> 02:45:44.410
think there was Kool g rap was before that.
Really?
Oh yeah.
Oh Shit.

2882
02:45:44.620 --> 02:45:46.300
I'm not saying he made up,
that's the thing.

2883
02:45:46.301 --> 02:45:47.920
I just think he let it go a little bit more.

2884
02:45:47.921 --> 02:45:51.910
Whereas Kool g rap might've worked to like try to not have it as bad when he was

2885
02:45:52.030 --> 02:45:55.750
recording Kool g rap.
So one of my all time and just let it go.
He said,

2886
02:45:55.751 --> 02:45:59.520
I got a lift and that's what's going to be,
I'm a big fan.

2887
02:45:59.580 --> 02:46:03.560
Axiom lit to content to be free and get down to the fans of VP.

2888
02:46:03.940 --> 02:46:06.960
Let me hear it here.
Empathy lab,

2889
02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:10.100
go walk the show.
Why?

2890
02:46:10.450 --> 02:46:12.410
<v 15>Because right now I buy the shake,</v>

2891
02:46:12.420 --> 02:46:17.420
convinced the ICPA is my name and my spouse to define your chair.

2892
02:46:18.570 --> 02:46:22.650
It's got too much tongue and too much lips struggling song.

2893
02:46:22.850 --> 02:46:26.300
I just get down and I go from my check.
One,
two,
one.

2894
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:31.940
That was the jam now,
right to terminate the fork is heat.
Kim was one of the best

2895
02:46:32.930 --> 02:46:35.990
<v 1>is another one that is young kids don't,
they don't respect enough.</v>

2896
02:46:36.460 --> 02:46:41.110
Rakim follow the leader.
Oh,
he was a gun.
You know what?
I actually passed it.

2897
02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:43.730
That's one that was missing off that list.
He was fifth yes.

2898
02:46:43.731 --> 02:46:46.190
He should have been on that as for sure.
I totally spaced on him.

2899
02:46:46.220 --> 02:46:48.260
We just sit three hours.
He is like,

2900
02:46:48.270 --> 02:46:53.180
there is no Nas without rock camp period and Nas would definitely agree to that.

2901
02:46:53.540 --> 02:46:57.860
He,
he is definitely one of the fathers of remodel lyricists.

2902
02:46:58.370 --> 02:47:01.220
You got me turned on to nods and rewind and that's one of my favorite songs.

2903
02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:03.710
It's brilliant.
Right.
The way he set it up,

2904
02:47:03.860 --> 02:47:05.900
going from the bullet back into the gun,

2905
02:47:05.901 --> 02:47:10.430
the whole thing taking the the events and re record.
Right and Mike and all that.

2906
02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:14.830
Yeah,
that's some good shit man.
He,
Nas has some good shit nomadic.

2907
02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:17.390
Was that the name of that album?
It's still magic.
The first album it,

2908
02:47:17.420 --> 02:47:18.740
his album is universally,

2909
02:47:18.741 --> 02:47:22.360
the first album is universally recognized as one of the great albums of all time

2910
02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:23.510
aromatic.
Yeah.

2911
02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:26.180
He went through a period where stuff wasn't nearly as good for awhile.

2912
02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:28.690
It was interesting.
But what happened with him?
I think the,

2913
02:47:28.691 --> 02:47:33.691
the feud with him and Jay z like sort of inspired him to get better because JC

2914
02:47:34.580 --> 02:47:39.140
called some of his shit garbage and like,
you know,
nausea was like Whoa,

2915
02:47:39.141 --> 02:47:39.681
like wait,
you know,

2916
02:47:39.681 --> 02:47:42.260
they had this thing back and forth and then they got together and then they

2917
02:47:42.261 --> 02:47:46.100
worked it out.
It was ridiculous.
The ether was,
he went after it.

2918
02:47:46.110 --> 02:47:48.920
I just think nas was doing things and got,
you know,
he made some money.

2919
02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:52.670
You got to remember he made that first album when he was like 17 or something

2920
02:47:52.671 --> 02:47:53.190
man,

2921
02:47:53.190 --> 02:47:58.190
like Oh classic all time for the ages album at 17 or 18 years old tops.

2922
02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:01.220
When he was on his first record,
main source,

2923
02:48:01.221 --> 02:48:05.390
I think he was like 16 or 15 and he like destroyed everybody on it.

2924
02:48:05.770 --> 02:48:10.400
Yeah.
Live at the barbecue.
When I was 12,

2925
02:48:10.401 --> 02:48:15.260
I went to hell for snuffin Jesus.
I was like,

2926
02:48:16.780 --> 02:48:20.510
yeah,
he has some,
the greatest lyrics of all time.
Some of the greatest,

2927
02:48:20.660 --> 02:48:22.540
most thought provoking lyrics of all time.

2928
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:25.130
The whole first album and many albums of his sense were great.

2929
02:48:25.131 --> 02:48:29.540
But that first one was just dumb.
It's like when you capture it in the can,

2930
02:48:29.541 --> 02:48:31.880
that lightening and you've got,
you know,
all of it's perfect.

2931
02:48:31.881 --> 02:48:34.640
That Alpha is damn near perfect.
Did you ever seen the one,

2932
02:48:34.641 --> 02:48:37.700
there's one album that is not universally thought of as being one of his best,

2933
02:48:37.701 --> 02:48:41.840
but the one with him,
with the,
uh,
the Sphinx face,
what does it,

2934
02:48:41.841 --> 02:48:44.070
what does it like some sort of Egyptian moat to that?
The one with a,

2935
02:48:44.090 --> 02:48:46.730
you could hate me know and all that on there.
I don't remember.

2936
02:48:46.731 --> 02:48:49.850
I don't know album names as well as I know the song and he's got a song on it

2937
02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:51.150
called,
um,
there's,

2938
02:48:51.270 --> 02:48:55.250
there's w welcome to the new world is one of my favorite nas songs that nobody

2939
02:48:55.251 --> 02:48:59.960
ever talks about and it's,
it's him talking about,
let me see.
Let me find his,

2940
02:48:59.961 --> 02:49:02.760
um,
his Wikipedia here.
It's,

2941
02:49:02.860 --> 02:49:06.720
it's a song you never hear people talk about,
but it's him talking about the,

2942
02:49:06.721 --> 02:49:07.770
was that it was written?

2943
02:49:08.670 --> 02:49:13.500
<v 0>It might be.
It might be that.
I think you might be right.
Let me see here I am,</v>

2944
02:49:13.860 --> 02:49:16.890
see if you can find Brian CV.
We'll,
we'll,
we'll end with this.

2945
02:49:16.980 --> 02:49:19.470
How much time we got left?
Seven minutes.
Seven minutes.

2946
02:49:20.220 --> 02:49:23.070
You're on timers now at three hours.
Return to a pumpkin.

2947
02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:27.730
We only have three hours at three hours.
The recordings over play a place.

2948
02:49:28.460 --> 02:49:32.520
I can remember Carlton,
we went longer than three hours.
Dude,
we crushed it today.

2949
02:49:32.730 --> 02:49:37.260
Today we went with,
we accelerated time.
We made three hours.
Seem like two hours.

2950
02:49:37.290 --> 02:49:40.740
I thought he was wrong the other road.
The road is that song?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2951
02:49:40.860 --> 02:49:44.640
It's called a welcome to the new world.
Welcome to the new world.

2952
02:49:44.700 --> 02:49:49.030
Welcome to the new road.
Do you find it go out on some nausea?
Yeah.

2953
02:49:49.031 --> 02:49:53.460
Let's listen to this shit because this is like back when Roy Jones Jr was the

2954
02:49:53.461 --> 02:49:57.960
baddest motherfucker on earth.
This is like some,
I think it was like the 90s,

2955
02:49:58.350 --> 02:50:02.610
I want to say nineties cause this nineties 90.

2956
02:50:03.930 --> 02:50:06.420
But it's about technology and the future

2957
02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:09.380
<v 2>were the that I think I know the song you're talking about,</v>

2958
02:50:09.381 --> 02:50:13.700
but I have to hear it to be refreshed.
It's really interesting because um,

2959
02:50:14.030 --> 02:50:15.260
it's on Africa.

2960
02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:19.970
So this is in the era when like he was going with production that I think more

2961
02:50:19.971 --> 02:50:22.340
than labels and stuff,
we're looking for that pop appeal.

2962
02:50:22.341 --> 02:50:25.580
I think he wasn't picking his beats wisely in this little error that he got.

2963
02:50:25.581 --> 02:50:27.650
I think that's when the only time he got slowed down is when,

2964
02:50:27.651 --> 02:50:29.990
as I think some wrong choices were made.

2965
02:50:29.991 --> 02:50:34.790
I don't think it had anything to do with his stuff or his lyricism.
Yeah.

2966
02:50:37.220 --> 02:50:41.840
See,
this is like,
I've never been a fan of outright ripping old songs like this.

2967
02:50:42.290 --> 02:50:44.860
I've never been a fan of it.
I mean if you do it collaboratively and like,

2968
02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:47.660
like there's,
there's producers like guy like DJ premier,

2969
02:50:47.661 --> 02:50:51.440
they would take something like that and chop it up into smaller pieces and turn

2970
02:50:51.441 --> 02:50:53.780
it into something new.
I'm a fan of that.

2971
02:50:53.930 --> 02:50:58.400
But when you just take an entire riff and like recreate it and kind of almost

2972
02:50:58.401 --> 02:51:00.620
copy the song but just make it into a wrap,

2973
02:51:00.621 --> 02:51:03.830
like versus with like even steal their hooks,
you know?
Right.

2974
02:51:04.250 --> 02:51:07.490
I think pocketed it with like Bruce Hornsby is just the way it is.

2975
02:51:08.270 --> 02:51:11.440
I that never been a fan of those things.
That's been not,

2976
02:51:11.460 --> 02:51:14.490
that's probably why that song wasn't so prevalent in my mind.
I,
yeah,

2977
02:51:14.540 --> 02:51:17.370
I'm a real big fan of what he's saying in it.
I did fantastic,

2978
02:51:17.390 --> 02:51:20.550
but I agree with you.
It's not the best B.
It's kind of annoying.
Listened to,

2979
02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:24.890
there was a little era his,
we got to,
the production got to clean for me.
Like,

2980
02:51:24.930 --> 02:51:28.610
Nah,
it should be on a grimy ass.
You know what I mean?

2981
02:51:28.620 --> 02:51:31.490
Like once he came back with ether and then he came back with the,

2982
02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:33.820
where he chopped up Apache for that made you look.
Yeah,

2983
02:51:34.310 --> 02:51:36.710
that's where he should be saying.
You know what I mean?

2984
02:51:36.711 --> 02:51:40.310
Like I think the record labels and people got some and radio and the success.

2985
02:51:40.311 --> 02:51:43.220
You want it when you're young and you first get success,
you want to,

2986
02:51:43.580 --> 02:51:45.740
you're listening to the people around you and they're telling you,

2987
02:51:45.741 --> 02:51:47.540
you got a copy of that to keep getting your success.

2988
02:51:48.200 --> 02:51:50.630
And you become either one of two things.
You know,
a guy that,

2989
02:51:50.631 --> 02:51:54.080
a band that just makes that formulaic album every time and you'll have some

2990
02:51:54.081 --> 02:51:57.410
success for awhile or you fall off the face of the planet.
You know what I mean?

2991
02:51:57.650 --> 02:52:01.250
Or you go back to what you know and be the genius you are and don't trust what

2992
02:52:01.251 --> 02:52:03.560
everybody else was saying and trust your guts.
And Nas,

2993
02:52:03.710 --> 02:52:06.130
I'm sure even knew he needed to be on the beat.
He's

2994
02:52:06.130 --> 02:52:10.000
<v 1>back where he should be.
He's been there for a minute now.
He's back completely.</v>

2995
02:52:10.001 --> 02:52:14.650
His last few cds were fantastic.
Absolutely.
Yeah,
he's his ether.

2996
02:52:14.651 --> 02:52:17.220
I think I've been enjoying ever since.
I think you're right about,

2997
02:52:17.310 --> 02:52:20.200
I think Jay z definitely sparked some fire under his ass for sure.
Yeah.

2998
02:52:20.320 --> 02:52:22.480
I think when someone calls you a garbage,
you just go,
well,

2999
02:52:22.481 --> 02:52:23.610
there was a lot more said than me.

3000
02:52:23.611 --> 02:52:25.540
I don't know how close he had his attention you paid,

3001
02:52:25.541 --> 02:52:28.400
but there's a lot of things about people's babies mamma's getting fucked up.

3002
02:52:28.760 --> 02:52:32.020
Like you know,
like Jay even apologized on radio in New York.

3003
02:52:32.021 --> 02:52:33.340
There's a lot of like hip hop,

3004
02:52:33.341 --> 02:52:37.480
little folklore around like is Mont Jay's mom supposedly made them go on the air

3005
02:52:37.481 --> 02:52:42.330
and apologize for some shit.
He said there was a lot of that going around.

3006
02:52:42.390 --> 02:52:44.800
There was a lot more than just a wraps going on.

3007
02:52:45.010 --> 02:52:47.470
It kind of goes back to what we were talking about earlier that you said that

3008
02:52:47.471 --> 02:52:49.300
you need a producer,
you need someone to argue with.

3009
02:52:49.390 --> 02:52:53.510
Sometimes the guy is good as Nas challenged me.
Yeah.
Like Yo,

3010
02:52:53.511 --> 02:52:56.380
it'd be that's not as good as it could be or that maybe that's not the right

3011
02:52:56.381 --> 02:52:57.450
choice for that song.
And,

3012
02:52:57.770 --> 02:53:01.630
and the way I've always looked at it as if I was passionate enough about it and

3013
02:53:01.631 --> 02:53:03.850
it was opposed to be in there,
I would fight for it.
Right.

3014
02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:07.450
But if you brought it up and I even questioned him for a thing second,

3015
02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:12.040
take it in and say maybe then maybe then it deserves to be Moldova and thought

3016
02:53:12.041 --> 02:53:12.370
about.

3017
02:53:12.370 --> 02:53:15.460
It's also when you can find out whether or not your representation is right for

3018
02:53:15.461 --> 02:53:17.050
you.
Because if they don't know what you're doing,

3019
02:53:17.051 --> 02:53:18.400
they try to change what you're doing.

3020
02:53:18.520 --> 02:53:23.520
Like Ari had a problem with a dude that was working with him where he has,

3021
02:53:23.711 --> 02:53:27.520
Ari has this fucking hilarious bit that we really happened when he was on his

3022
02:53:27.790 --> 02:53:32.770
long walk over this giant bridge in Sydney and he had to take a shit like in the

3023
02:53:32.771 --> 02:53:36.580
middle of this bro,
there's no turning back.
He was going to shit his pants.

3024
02:53:36.670 --> 02:53:38.920
Something was going to have,
no matter what he did is no turning back.

3025
02:53:38.921 --> 02:53:39.754
You're in the middle of this bridge.

3026
02:53:39.760 --> 02:53:43.070
Takes an hour to walk back to where the fuck you were.
Ah.

3027
02:53:43.090 --> 02:53:47.360
So he's like stuck and it's,
it's a hilarious bit.
And his,
his Ma,

3028
02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:50.680
I don't know who it was.
They were like,
you got to drop that.
It's a shit joke.

3029
02:53:50.681 --> 02:53:52.750
You shouldn't do shit jokes.
She was like,
what?

3030
02:53:53.280 --> 02:53:55.520
Like did you pay attention to that?
Like that's a,

3031
02:53:55.540 --> 02:53:58.930
that's a joke about being a human being and being in a real situation.
That act.

3032
02:53:59.110 --> 02:54:00.940
Get the fuck Outta here.
And he got rid of the dude.

3033
02:54:00.941 --> 02:54:03.380
People who have made careers out of shit jokes man.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3034
02:54:03.400 --> 02:54:06.400
There's nothing wrong with a shit joke.
If it's a good one.
Hell No.
Every joke,

3035
02:54:06.401 --> 02:54:09.160
every subject is on the,
the,
the menu.

3036
02:54:09.190 --> 02:54:12.170
If it's Mr Hankey would never have existed if somebody listens to that.

3037
02:54:15.490 --> 02:54:19.750
Exactly.

my bets are within 10 years,

I gotta be more diligent.

14th 14th grand prairie,
Texas.

3071
02:56:15.661 --> 02:56:19.760
That's right outside of Dallas with a Ari Shaffir and Duncan Trussell,

I got a weekend at La Jolla comedy store.

3077
02:56:40.701 --> 02:56:43.640
It's going to be January 28th and March 1st,

3078
02:56:43.641 --> 02:56:47.570
which is a Friday and Saturday with Tony Hinchcliffe,
Eleanor,
Sarah Wine Shank,

3079
02:56:47.571 --> 02:56:49.820
and a bunch of people you could back in time to do that one.

3080
02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:52.250
He [inaudible] Mowgli.

3081
02:56:52.430 --> 02:56:54.830
The comedy store in La Jolla is one of the great all time rooms,

3082
02:56:54.970 --> 02:56:58.490
far as ways to design one of the great all time rooms and a real stuffy

3083
02:56:58.491 --> 02:56:59.180
community.

3084
02:56:59.180 --> 02:57:02.920
So it's nice to go there and sling some fucking cum all over the walls.
Poop.

3085
02:57:03.110 --> 02:57:06.110
We love the fuck out of you people.
Thank you everybody for tuning in tomorrow.

3086
02:57:06.111 --> 02:57:10.580
The Great Ari Shaffir will join us and hopefully Wednesday we'll have Campbell

3087
02:57:10.580 --> 02:57:11.660
Mclaren,
my former boss,

3088
02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:14.840
and one of the original producers of the ultimate fighting championship.

3089
02:57:14.841 --> 02:57:18.790
We'll see if we can get him on a Wednesday.
If not,
we'll get somebody else.

3090
02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:21.500
All right.
The train goes on.
