<v Speaker 1>at this thing called green belly meal </v>

5
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:11.184

11
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>people walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes like six months.</v>

12
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm into stuff like that.</v>

13
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>That's like a whole different part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

14
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you get to when you do stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

15
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.623
<v Speaker 1>well you got to have a real commitment </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not doing anything but </v>

16
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>that for six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:40.614
<v Speaker 1>It's a different lifestyle changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a different time of your life </v>

18
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I feel when you do something like that.</v>

19
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like being a fighter,</v>

20
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.973
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're pretty limited as to what </v>

21
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.424
<v Speaker 1>you can do outside of fighting your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as like you're always recovering </v>

22
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:55.374
<v Speaker 1>from training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always involved in something </v>

23
00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>related to either promotion or </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation.</v>

24
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreed.</v>

25
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.261
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

26
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:05.094
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not telling you anything you </v>

27
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:08.890
<v Speaker 1>don't know how many of these things have</v>
<v Speaker 1>you done with Delilah?</v>

28
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Lot done a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.813
<v Speaker 1>that it's all or nothing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's so good that if you don't </v>

30
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>invest every ounce of yourself into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

31
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>there's somebody else to is in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

32
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you have to do that or else</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get passed by.</v>

33
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you also feel like there's,</v>

34
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.053
<v Speaker 1>you have to be super objective to about </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you stand and where your skills </v>

35
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:32.064
<v Speaker 1>are at [inaudible] course you're always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're either at a point of constant </v>

36
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>improvement or you're at some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stagnation or decline.</v>

37
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

38
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.243
<v Speaker 1>I think sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then that question always comes to </v>

39
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:44.694
<v Speaker 1>mind according to win and loss ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't always tell the truth </v>

40
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.223
<v Speaker 1>because it's not always the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could just be a bad night and a good </v>

41
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:52.434
<v Speaker 1>matchup and they had a game plan or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost and now you're going to sit and go </v>

42
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:56.604
<v Speaker 1>to the drawing board and say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was off because of one last </v>

43
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.430
<v Speaker 1>really makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of a mixture,</v>

44
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to find the happy medium,</v>

45
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 1>it comes down to trust in the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>

46
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.393
<v Speaker 1>I'm not having nothing but yes men </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you and I feel like as long as </v>

47
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>you have a good solid base of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that give the truth to you,</v>

48
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to think with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion and you can think with logic and</v>

49
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:19.704
<v Speaker 1>then I think it's important to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people around you so you don't </v>

50
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>steer off the course because even if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

51
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you do have a loss,</v>

52
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.493
<v Speaker 1>it's not saying that everything is off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly something wasn't adequate </v>

53
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.433
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that,</v>

54
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.630
<v Speaker 1>in that particular match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

55
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>So you're just getting off of the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>loss ever of mixed martial arts career.</v>

56
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>The first one you got caught by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ride with a guillotine.</v>

57
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>And then the second one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

58
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.851
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cody,</v>

59
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:46.180
<v Speaker 1>no love fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

60
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>what are your thoughts on it now having </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to reflect and look back and I'm,</v>

61
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.140
<v Speaker 1>well my thoughts are a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

62
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I pretty much laid it all out</v>

63
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.270
<v Speaker 2>right away because I wanted to just do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that at,</v>

64
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 2>which was at the press conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the post fight press conference.</v>

65
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I pretty much just wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

66
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:09.724
<v Speaker 2>I literally laid every ounce of every </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I had at that moment out there </v>

67
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 2>for everybody to hear in a point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>on very vulnerable.</v>

68
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 2>And I did that on purpose to show that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not all,</v>

69
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>

70
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't want to show their </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability.</v>

71
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Some people want to just be seen as only</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect,</v>

72
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 2>only tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only strong.</v>

73
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:31.564
<v Speaker 2>And really the truth of what makes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strongest people in the world is their </v>

74
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability early until they learn how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be tough.</v>

75
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

76
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.853
<v Speaker 2>losing is part of that lesson </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately for everybody and being </v>

77
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 2>unsuccessful as part of that lesson for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people just as much as losing.</v>

78
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you do what you can with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

79
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:49.743
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I feel now is like I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I can with it and they only way to </v>

80
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 2>make the best of it is to accept it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

81
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 2>The second it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that,</v>

82
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just the way it is.</v>

83
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 2>That's the way that this has been slated</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this portion of my life.</v>

84
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 2>And just move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as long as you embrace it,</v>

85
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 2>don't make excuses for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

86
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:11.074
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can actually look at what you </v>

87
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 2>did wrong and take it in the second you </v>
<v Speaker 2>make an excuse.</v>

88
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 2>The second you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

89
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 2>I was a little off here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little out there because of this,</v>

90
00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:18.754
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the second you allow your </v>

91
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 2>mind to go into a path of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

92
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't an,</v>

93
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.593
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't in my control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means you're not really dealing </v>

94
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 2>with the problems at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

95
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 2>I think you're kind of bypassing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems at hand when you do that.</v>

96
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 2>And then you can grow from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

97
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:34.894
<v Speaker 2>So what's the point of a loss if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to grow from it and get the </v>

98
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:37.174
<v Speaker 2>most out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's just useless if you don't </v>

99
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 2>accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

100
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:41.854
<v Speaker 2>There's a real instinct that many </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters show like almost immediately </v>

101
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:45.994
<v Speaker 2>after a loss to go right into what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with the camp or what was wrong </v>

102
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 2>with an injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they could've done differently,</v>

103
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:56.881
<v Speaker 2>personal problems and that that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>can wreck havoc with your mind.</v>

104
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

105
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.833
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more than wreaking havoc with </v>

106
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:00.724
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it just shows how long it's </v>

107
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 2>gonna take for them to get over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>loss.</v>

108
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

109
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:06.214
<v Speaker 2>The second you just say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lay it all out there and everybody </v>

110
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 2>knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including yourself.</v>

111
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.633
<v Speaker 2>The next step is growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no longer stagnant and sitting in </v>

112
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 2>feeling the loss and trying to accept </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

113
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 2>I've already accepted it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I accepted it.</v>

114
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 2>The second I shook his hand in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>octagon and and they,</v>

115
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:26.014
<v Speaker 2>they raised his hand is the winter like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I really going to sit here and make </v>

116
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:31.354
<v Speaker 2>excuses because let's say on the judges'</v>
<v Speaker 2>scorecard I had some mindset that's </v>

117
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:37.121
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

118
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have lost the decision or </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this,</v>

119
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 2>maybe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

120
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 2>what's the point of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in the end,</v>

121
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 2>it's already been chocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's already there.</v>

122
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 2>It's written down regardless of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody says.</v>

123
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:52.420
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not leaving that piece of paper.</v>

124
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 2>So what's the point of really saying all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff,</v>

125
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 2>letting people argue that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

126
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:57.610
<v Speaker 2>you could have one here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have went,</v>

127
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.463
<v Speaker 2>what is where his argument anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the logic and then where's the </v>

128
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 2>point and all that and I'm just sick and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tired of excuses.</v>

129
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:05.174
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've fought so many years winning so </v>

130
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:06.914
<v Speaker 2>many years hearing so many excuses about</v>
<v Speaker 2>why I beat people and I wanted to set a </v>

131
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 2>perimeter right off the bat that I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>that person.</v>

132
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.663
<v Speaker 3>Now you're getting really well known as </v>
<v Speaker 3>an MMA analysts and I think you do an </v>

133
00:06:17.761 --> 00:06:18.594
<v Speaker 3>amazing job on Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're one of the best guys in </v>

134
00:06:20.161 --> 00:06:21.120
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're really,</v>

135
00:06:21.121 --> 00:06:21.954
<v Speaker 3>really good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that people are </v>

136
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.533
<v Speaker 3>getting a chance to see because of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is how your mind works and how much </v>

137
00:06:28.201 --> 00:06:30.930
<v Speaker 3>thought you put into not just fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>

138
00:06:30.931 --> 00:06:31.764
<v Speaker 3>but the whole process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole process of preparation and </v>

139
00:06:35.491 --> 00:06:38.700
<v Speaker 3>mindset while the competition is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

140
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.773
<v Speaker 3>And that's also being reflective right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and the way you express how you get </v>

141
00:06:44.131 --> 00:06:45.660
<v Speaker 3>over a loss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where did,</v>

142
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.640
<v Speaker 3>where did wherever you learned to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

143
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.720
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well my mom is a big reason for that.</v>

144
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:54.284
<v Speaker 2>I would say early on she just always </v>
<v Speaker 2>forced me to deal with the things I </v>

145
00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:58.604
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to deal with and not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with them but look at him in the </v>

146
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 2>eye and talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of stuff?</v>

147
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

148
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.533
<v Speaker 2>you still a packet of gum from the store</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you walk out with it and you're </v>

149
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.403
<v Speaker 2>seven years old and you get home and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eating a piece of gum and your </v>

150
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 2>mom goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't buy that.</v>

151
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.333
<v Speaker 2>Where did you get that gum?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we drive back with the gum in my </v>

152
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 2>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in the wrapper.</v>

153
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:16.784
<v Speaker 2>So the person at the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not enough because I </v>

154
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:22.550
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed the cash registers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got to apologize to them.</v>

155
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:23.920
<v Speaker 2>And then I got to go to the owner of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

156
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 2>of the other star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the manager and apologize to them.</v>

157
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.993
<v Speaker 2>And then might have to go paint a wall </v>
<v Speaker 2>forum to make up for the piece of gum </v>

158
00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:33.231
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

159
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:34.064
<v Speaker 2>it goes all the way down to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my mom has been that way since I </v>

160
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:39.120
<v Speaker 2>can remember to where there's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

161
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.200
<v Speaker 2>She would never ever let me make an </v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse for anything I ever did ever.</v>

162
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.183
<v Speaker 2>And I used to get so frustrated with her</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she would also never really get </v>

163
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 2>mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She never raised her voice.</v>

164
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 2>She would never really show a whole lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of emotion.</v>

165
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:54.650
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would literally say,</v>

166
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to yell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to scream.</v>

167
00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get angry.</v>

168
00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:00.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to give you that power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's one.</v>

169
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.753
<v Speaker 2>And that meant I was getting one </v>
<v Speaker 2>whooping when I got home when I did </v>

170
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:04.094
<v Speaker 2>something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now I got to sit and think about </v>

171
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:08.030
<v Speaker 2>that for the next five hours until we </v>
<v Speaker 2>get home.</v>

172
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 2>And then she takes me into a room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she sits me down with no anger.</v>

173
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Everything's understood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she says,</v>

174
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:15.134
<v Speaker 2>do you know why we're here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she explained to me why we're here </v>

175
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:18.164
<v Speaker 2>and why I'm being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why I'm in trouble and why I'm getting </v>

176
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 2>smacked on the ass with this breadboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she just,</v>

177
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.050
<v Speaker 2>there was never any escaping anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

178
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.033
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it put me in this weird mindset where I </v>

179
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:32.054
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't make excuses and anybody who </v>

180
00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 2>makes excuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call them out on it because it's old.</v>

181
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.330
<v Speaker 2>It's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

182
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.110
<v Speaker 2>it's flawed in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just weak.</v>

183
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.700
<v Speaker 3>That's a great lesson that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>great way to be raised to your mom.</v>

184
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Not Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>

185
00:08:49.531 --> 00:08:53.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I do this every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just something that's like made me,</v>

186
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you asked.</v>

187
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 2>I got that in my mind and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wired me a little different.</v>

188
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:02.190
<v Speaker 2>My grandma's a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty crazy on that too.</v>

189
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:03.024
<v Speaker 2>So between my grandmother and my mom who</v>
<v Speaker 2>helped raise me because my dad wasn't </v>

190
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:06.444
<v Speaker 2>around so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those two molded me into this weird </v>

191
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they could have got through</v>

192
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:17.660
<v Speaker 2>it without beating you without a paddle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

193
00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

194
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.403
<v Speaker 2>You think that wasn't part of it was me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and my brother is too much little </v>

195
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 2>mutants in the trailer park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we'd be.</v>

196
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.473
<v Speaker 2>We'd be fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Mom's at work wearing in the trailer </v>

197
00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:29.734
<v Speaker 2>and my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We lived in a trailer across the street </v>

198
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 2>from my grandmother and it was like $400</v>
<v Speaker 2>a month,</v>

199
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live in this trailer is one bedroom </v>

200
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:36.240
<v Speaker 2>single wide.</v>

201
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.073
<v Speaker 2>She would come when we would fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd hear the door open and my grandma </v>

202
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:41.130
<v Speaker 2>would be at the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and my bro,</v>

203
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.023
<v Speaker 2>because you could hear a slamming into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the floor because it's echoes from the </v>

204
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 2>bottom of the trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

205
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 2>And so she'd run across the street and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

206
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 2>we knew we were in trouble and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandma came over.</v>

207
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:52.830
<v Speaker 2>It was bad news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>

208
00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:55.160
<v Speaker 2>It's just a weird upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of to an extending.</v>

209
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Everybody got raised by their family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by my mom and my grandmother,</v>

210
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.053
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it put a different mentality in me and </v>

211
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:04.380
<v Speaker 2>my grandmother's very tough individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd been through a lot.</v>

212
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Now when you started fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did they approach it?</v>

213
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another odd thing is um,</v>

214
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 2>my mom was just all support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

215
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to college when I started,</v>

216
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:17.603
<v Speaker 2>when I start just started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was coaching a local high school and </v>

217
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:21.770
<v Speaker 2>one of the kids that I was coaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight up,</v>

218
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:22.643
<v Speaker 2>I was 19 years old at this point and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just graduated High School and started </v>

219
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:29.130
<v Speaker 2>coaching a local high school team </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wanted to compete wrestling.</v>

220
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:29.993
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't get into college like I </v>

221
00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:32.304
<v Speaker 2>wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to wrestle and didn't do all these </v>

222
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I just needed to compete.</v>

223
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:36.810
<v Speaker 2>So I got in the room and started </v>
<v Speaker 2>coaching these kids.</v>

224
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.090
<v Speaker 2>Well they're my age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 18,</v>

225
00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:40.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just graduated.</v>

226
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:43.780
<v Speaker 2>So we become friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of these guys invites me to A.</v>

227
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy goes to jump in there and start </v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

228
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So during this time my mom,</v>

229
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm working three jobs,</v>

230
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm working at Sherwin Williams,</v>

231
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:56.560
<v Speaker 2>I am a janitor at the gym and then I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>coaching this,</v>

232
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.473
<v Speaker 2>this high school wrestling team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm going to school at night </v>

233
00:10:59.641 --> 00:11:01.820
<v Speaker 2>and I'm training in between that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are,</v>

234
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.070
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm doing in Tucson and </v>
<v Speaker 2>during this time,</v>

235
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.360
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told my mom,</v>

236
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just so tired of school.</v>

237
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.490
<v Speaker 2>I go to night school after my three </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs,</v>

238
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.540
<v Speaker 2>three jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I go to night school at 8:00 PM</v>

239
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:13.650
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just wore out.</v>

240
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.693
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting in Spanish class one day </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to learn like what I've been </v>

241
00:11:17.161 --> 00:11:19.470
<v Speaker 2>learning in high school and in Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 2>class I'm like,</v>

242
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:20.603
<v Speaker 2>why am I paying for this school when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just did this class in high school and </v>

243
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:26.910
<v Speaker 2>now I'm paying for it to get an </v>
<v Speaker 2>associate's degree to go to another four</v>

244
00:11:26.911 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 2>years in college and I'm going to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>debt for like,</v>

245
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:30.690
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be here.</v>

246
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.320
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't happy in school after all my </v>
<v Speaker 2>days at work.</v>

247
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I said,</v>

248
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:37.194
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only time I felt free and happy it </v>

249
00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:39.504
<v Speaker 2>was in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only time I could talk and </v>

250
00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:43.770
<v Speaker 2>laugh and smile and be myself hurting </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>

251
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:45.120
<v Speaker 2>punching things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking things,</v>

252
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.520
<v Speaker 2>yelling at things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling people how I felt.</v>

253
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.320
<v Speaker 2>And then if they had a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could fight about it.</v>

254
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 2>I was at peace there.</v>

255
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

256
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 2>I just going to school and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom,</v>

257
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:55.234
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start training to become a </v>

258
00:11:56.471 --> 00:11:57.304
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said they got the ultimate fighter </v>

259
00:11:58.181 --> 00:11:59.280
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

260
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's growing.</v>

261
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Now's the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm going to do it,</v>

262
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I need to go all in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

263
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:04.294
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to go to school to be </v>

264
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to go to college.</v>

265
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:07.603
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow your heart and you will be </v>

266
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:10.870
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a guarantee.</v>

267
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:13.750
<v Speaker 2>And she was right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

268
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.590
<v Speaker 2>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom has a weird spiritual,</v>

269
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:22.480
<v Speaker 2>emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a way of talking,</v>

270
00:12:22.481 --> 00:12:24.660
<v Speaker 2>explaining and getting through to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

271
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.250
<v Speaker 2>that can't be explained until you meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody like that will also.</v>

272
00:12:28.251 --> 00:12:28.971
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

273
00:12:28.971 --> 00:12:29.804
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no one that's ever going to be </v>

274
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:32.350
<v Speaker 2>able to recreate that because she made </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

275
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good little.</v>

276
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody's mom.</v>

277
00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Everybody believes their mom has their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

278
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:40.360
<v Speaker 2>moms are special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:42.490
<v Speaker 2>we all know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every,</v>

280
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.383
<v Speaker 2>every person has their own way that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were raised and brought up and then </v>

281
00:12:45.971 --> 00:12:47.980
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pass that onto their child.</v>

282
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:49.390
<v Speaker 2>My mom had a hard life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

283
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.930
<v Speaker 2>so I think she just so wise that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed a lot of,</v>

284
00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.173
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of wisdom off to me young because </v>

285
00:12:57.911 --> 00:12:58.744
<v Speaker 2>she just growing up and raising us broke</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she did by herself I think just </v>

286
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:03.784
<v Speaker 2>taught her so much that she didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>us to have to live and he kind of </v>

287
00:13:06.071 --> 00:13:06.904
<v Speaker 2>struggled life like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she made us learn the hard way with </v>

288
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:10.054
<v Speaker 2>her instead of her taking everything and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not teaching us anything we lived at </v>

289
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:16.360
<v Speaker 2>with her and grew in the experience with</v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

290
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.170
<v Speaker 2>And then that got added to my life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I wanted to do moving forward.</v>

291
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.870
<v Speaker 3>Now you developed a really unusual </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting style.</v>

292
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.793
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I've said about you that one of </v>

293
00:13:28.201 --> 00:13:29.034
<v Speaker 3>the more unusual things about your style</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that I could watch you like as a </v>

294
00:13:33.781 --> 00:13:34.614
<v Speaker 3>silhouette.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone could show me a silhouette of </v>

295
00:13:37.071 --> 00:13:38.200
<v Speaker 3>you moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

296
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:39.120
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's dominick Cruz.</v>

297
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.073
<v Speaker 3>There's very few people that you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>say that about like where you would </v>

298
00:13:42.211 --> 00:13:44.520
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously recognize their </v>
<v Speaker 3>movements,</v>

299
00:13:44.521 --> 00:13:49.310
<v Speaker 3>like your movements are very unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to pattern and a,</v>

300
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:52.860
<v Speaker 3>they're not really indicative of like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>style.</v>

301
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the Thai style.</v>

302
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.540
<v Speaker 3>People have that light front leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a karate style,</v>

303
00:13:57.541 --> 00:14:00.450
<v Speaker 3>like wonder Boy Thompson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of styles where you go,</v>

304
00:14:00.451 --> 00:14:01.650
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what this guy's doing.</v>

305
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.270
<v Speaker 3>Your style is very uniquely yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

306
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.150
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what sort of caused that?</v>

307
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Where'd that come from?</v>

308
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a mixture of things as I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting since,</v>

309
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.630
<v Speaker 2>as long as the Diaz brothers I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 19 years old,</v>

310
00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:21.580
<v Speaker 2>back in 2005,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've been doing it since then.</v>

311
00:14:21.581 --> 00:14:22.414
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of it is that just years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and years of fighting and facing </v>

312
00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:26.890
<v Speaker 2>different people and seeing what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues were,</v>

313
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.870
<v Speaker 2>but more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was built around the fact that I knew</v>

314
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.760
<v Speaker 2>whether I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether,</v>

315
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.180
<v Speaker 2>whether I knew I was ahead or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mindset said I have to fight,</v>

316
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.093
<v Speaker 2>do something different because this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>new sport with new rules and new </v>

317
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.600
<v Speaker 2>different equipment than it's ever been </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen in the history of this world.</v>

318
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.630
<v Speaker 2>So that means there's four ounce gloves </v>
<v Speaker 2>were using kicks,</v>

319
00:14:49.631 --> 00:14:50.830
<v Speaker 2>knees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elbows and hands,</v>

320
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.033
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I,</v>

321
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all eight limbs.</v>

322
00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.970
<v Speaker 2>So I said I need to make sure that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not taking damage.</v>

323
00:14:59.040 --> 00:14:59.873
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as I'm not taking damage I </v>

324
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 2>should.</v>

325
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.193
<v Speaker 2>When I got to be hard to hit on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense needs to be flawless with these </v>

326
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 2>size gloves is not going to be the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>as boxing.</v>

327
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:07.964
<v Speaker 2>I can't just sit here and cover like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this because my gloves or a quarter of </v>

328
00:15:10.631 --> 00:15:14.180
<v Speaker 2>the size things peak in and I learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>that real quick and so I said,</v>

329
00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:15.800
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I need to move nonstop.</v>

330
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:16.634
<v Speaker 2>I can't sit still like I do in boxing or</v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing because you're going to get </v>

331
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:21.010
<v Speaker 2>taken down as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's.</v>

332
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.380
<v Speaker 2>That's where my mind started changing </v>
<v Speaker 2>his with the takedown.</v>

333
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.273
<v Speaker 2>That's where I knew I really had to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something different is in no striking </v>

334
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 2>sport on earth is their takedown </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved,</v>

335
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:36.910
<v Speaker 2>so that means that I need to attack on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different plane and that means I need to</v>

336
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.470
<v Speaker 2>not be down the center line as long as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

337
00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:40.460
<v Speaker 2>not down the center line.</v>

338
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.293
<v Speaker 2>It takes away a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as I don't fight on the center </v>

339
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:48.830
<v Speaker 2>line all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes away my almost all weapons from</v>

340
00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:49.664
<v Speaker 2>all styles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boxing is probably the one style that </v>

341
00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:53.684
<v Speaker 2>flows most off the center line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking about Moitai or we're </v>

342
00:15:57.651 --> 00:15:58.484
<v Speaker 2>talking about wrestling or talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>a judo or we're talking about it almost </v>

343
00:16:02.721 --> 00:16:03.554
<v Speaker 2>every other martial art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They attack down a straight line and so </v>

344
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:07.483
<v Speaker 2>I knew I could take away most of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons just by changing the plane that </v>

345
00:16:11.661 --> 00:16:12.494
<v Speaker 2>I fought on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I fought on a different plane than </v>

346
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:16.340
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they would not have answers for the</v>

347
00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:18.860
<v Speaker 2>plane that I'm fighting it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything they do is on that line.</v>

348
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.870
<v Speaker 2>So instead of fighting them in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>style,</v>

349
00:16:20.871 --> 00:16:22.610
<v Speaker 2>I fought the lines that they're fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

350
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.220
<v Speaker 2>And then that kind of changed things </v>
<v Speaker 2>mixed with the defense.</v>

351
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:26.423
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always enjoyed watching you fight </v>

352
00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:28.254
<v Speaker 3>and I've always enjoyed explaining how </v>
<v Speaker 3>you fight the people that have never </v>

353
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.450
<v Speaker 3>seen martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand it because for people</v>

354
00:16:34.451 --> 00:16:35.284
<v Speaker 3>on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe someone who's not a fan or never </v>

355
00:16:37.201 --> 00:16:38.650
<v Speaker 3>did any martial arts training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

356
00:16:38.651 --> 00:16:40.400
<v Speaker 3>they look at it like just violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

357
00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.920
<v Speaker 3>They see guys just beating the shit out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of each other and what I.</v>

358
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.650
<v Speaker 3>The way I tried to describe it to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend once I said,</v>

359
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.870
<v Speaker 3>think about it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

360
00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:53.580
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot like a conversation and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>more words you have at your disposal,</v>

361
00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:54.414
<v Speaker 3>the more verbal memory you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you to stringing together </v>

362
00:16:57.361 --> 00:16:58.194
<v Speaker 3>sentences you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more fluently the conversation is </v>

363
00:17:00.781 --> 00:17:01.614
<v Speaker 3>going to come out of your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more it's going to flow and when </v>

364
00:17:03.781 --> 00:17:06.900
<v Speaker 3>you're watching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll show someone like you when</v>

365
00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to have call called a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>

366
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:12.510
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to have a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Dominic Cruz inside the octagon.</v>

367
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.200
<v Speaker 3>You don't know where the fuck he's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you,</v>

368
00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.034
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're setting up so many weird angles </v>

369
00:17:17.881 --> 00:17:20.250
<v Speaker 3>and so much weird movements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many false entries,</v>

370
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.430
<v Speaker 3>and there's so much going on that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were in a lot of ways,</v>

371
00:17:23.431 --> 00:17:28.200
<v Speaker 3>you're overloading a person's reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're overloading their mind.</v>

372
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is partially what I'm trying to do.</v>

373
00:17:31.121 --> 00:17:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

374
00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Now you're starting to see that over </v>
<v Speaker 2>time there's an answer for every style.</v>

375
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.340
<v Speaker 2>There's an answer for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

376
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.850
<v Speaker 2>and that's the fun of this thing is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not stagnant.</v>

377
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:42.880
<v Speaker 2>It's not always the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

378
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.150
<v Speaker 2>and there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't answered everything that's,</v>

379
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.950
<v Speaker 2>and then you got to adjust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>

380
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:48.933
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm on his adjustments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My whole game is built on adjustment so </v>

381
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.590
<v Speaker 2>it can always change and always look </v>
<v Speaker 2>different because every round I come out</v>

382
00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:57.780
<v Speaker 2>with a different adjustment off of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you did to me.</v>

383
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.440
<v Speaker 2>And now you're fighting a different guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>every round you just don't know it.</v>

384
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.873
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that comes from fakes and seeing </v>

385
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:10.200
<v Speaker 2>what they want on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that comes from their game plan.</v>

386
00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole mixture reads in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>

387
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.670
<v Speaker 2>that's something that you either have or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have.</v>

388
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:15.503
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody like Anderson Silva can make </v>

389
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:19.860
<v Speaker 2>reeds extremely quickly and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's made him so successful.</v>

390
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Demetrius Johnson reads extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly,</v>

391
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.380
<v Speaker 2>makes them successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best in the world had just,</v>

392
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the best for me,</v>

393
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:32.820
<v Speaker 2>the best in the world aren't the ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>who just when it's someone's who win and</v>

394
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:33.654
<v Speaker 2>stay on top for a long period of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>because now you don't just have a style </v>

395
00:18:38.231 --> 00:18:41.160
<v Speaker 2>to win a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a style to stay winning,</v>

396
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.593
<v Speaker 2>which means that your style hits so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>different avenues that you can compete </v>

397
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:48.084
<v Speaker 2>with all these different styles no </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what they match you up against </v>

398
00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 2>until now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my style,</v>

399
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 2>I built it so that no matter which style</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to throw at me,</v>

400
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.713
<v Speaker 2>it was going to give it a problem and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the basis that I wanted to </v>

401
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:01.560
<v Speaker 2>create.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I fought,</v>

402
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 2>every single time I fought somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

403
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:04.913
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter what your gift is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the planes that I'm going to fight you </v>

404
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:08.424
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it impossible for your gifts to be </v>

405
00:19:09.571 --> 00:19:10.404
<v Speaker 2>your gifts anymore.</v>

406
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Now I've seen you practice no senior </v>
<v Speaker 2>footwork drills and I've seen you know a</v>

407
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.420
<v Speaker 2>lot of your steps and the different </v>
<v Speaker 2>various entries.</v>

408
00:19:18.421 --> 00:19:23.421
<v Speaker 2>You have techniques or these moves that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've learned from somewhere.</v>

409
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Have you acquired them from other </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts?</v>

410
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:26.994
<v Speaker 2>Have you sort of adjusted them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>adapted them or did you figure them out </v>

411
00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:31.430
<v Speaker 2>your own?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a mixture.</v>

412
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.273
<v Speaker 2>Working with Eric Tell Pharaoh was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge step because I had a lot of </v>

413
00:19:34.171 --> 00:19:36.030
<v Speaker 2>naturals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best coaches in the sport and</v>

414
00:19:36.031 --> 00:19:38.790
<v Speaker 2>one of the most underappreciated gods </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he doesn't blow his own horn.</v>

415
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:39.803
<v Speaker 2>That's why I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the coaches that don't need the </v>

416
00:19:42.571 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 2>pats on the back for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're about the athlete.</v>

417
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.520
<v Speaker 2>Eric is about every athlete he's ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>coached.</v>

418
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 2>He's not about himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's great corner man too.</v>

419
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:52.890
<v Speaker 2>When he starts talking in the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows what he's doing.</v>

420
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:53.723
<v Speaker 2>He's been in this sport 20 plus years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm the bigger thing that Eric </v>

421
00:19:58.291 --> 00:19:59.124
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get credit for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is his understanding of the </v>

422
00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:03.720
<v Speaker 2>psychology that goes into preparing </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody to win a fight.</v>

423
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.120
<v Speaker 2>You could have all the tools around that</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

424
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:08.070
<v Speaker 2>They could be the best human being on </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>

425
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.113
<v Speaker 2>but if their mind is not pieced together</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the psychological pieces are not </v>

426
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:12.774
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be able to trigger </v>

427
00:20:13.351 --> 00:20:15.390
<v Speaker 2>them and get them in the fight when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to.</v>

428
00:20:15.391 --> 00:20:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Stevens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great example of somebody like that.</v>

429
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.563
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you gotta like get crazy with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that dude in the corner and like even </v>

430
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:26.430
<v Speaker 2>like slap him around a little bit maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's just goes and he'll,</v>

431
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:27.443
<v Speaker 2>he'll kill somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a psychological thing </v>

432
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:32.320
<v Speaker 2>about certain athletes that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to touch on.</v>

433
00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.193
<v Speaker 2>Same with Greg Jackson is another guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>who can do that and that's what makes a </v>

434
00:20:35.851 --> 00:20:38.370
<v Speaker 2>good coach on that night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good corner man on that night.</v>

435
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Not just what you did for eight weeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding pads and uh,</v>

436
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:43.883
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patting the guy in the back and wiping </v>

437
00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:48.520
<v Speaker 2>the sweat off their shoulders and know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know doing interviews and looking famous</v>

438
00:20:48.521 --> 00:20:49.181
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

439
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:52.000
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing to make sure this </v>
<v Speaker 2>person wins on that night?</v>

440
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.753
<v Speaker 2>Not what are you doing to make sure you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look good in this person's corner while </v>

441
00:20:56.351 --> 00:20:57.184
<v Speaker 2>he wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that I've run into </v>

442
00:20:59.051 --> 00:20:59.884
<v Speaker 2>a lot with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is people a lot want to associate </v>

443
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:05.980
<v Speaker 2>themselves with you when you're winning </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not actually be there for you but be</v>

444
00:21:05.981 --> 00:21:08.020
<v Speaker 2>there so they look good in your corner </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you win.</v>

445
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.910
<v Speaker 2>And those are the people you got to cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

446
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Those are the yes men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are,</v>

447
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:13.150
<v Speaker 2>those are the ones that you got to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>careful with.</v>

448
00:21:13.151 --> 00:21:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Eric is the opposite of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

449
00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.110
<v Speaker 2>and he is somebody that's why I stick </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

450
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.510
<v Speaker 2>You someday I can trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He understands my psychology,</v>

451
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:23.260
<v Speaker 2>understands my emotional roller coaster </v>
<v Speaker 2>of outside life,</v>

452
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.210
<v Speaker 2>personal life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight life,</v>

453
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.103
<v Speaker 2>everything makes together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've gone through this together and </v>

454
00:21:29.291 --> 00:21:31.000
<v Speaker 2>then he's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a trustworthy person.</v>

455
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.750
<v Speaker 2>They're not a lot of people you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>trust in this industry these days are in</v>

456
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:37.240
<v Speaker 2>fighting in general boxing or MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard.</v>

457
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.363
<v Speaker 2>He knows his stuff and he is underrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the fact that he doesn't </v>

458
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:44.530
<v Speaker 2>toot his own horn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't get on these interviews.</v>

459
00:21:44.531 --> 00:21:46.520
<v Speaker 2>A does hurt him a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

460
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:51.550
<v Speaker 2>but that was what was hurting me early </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my career to where a lot of light and</v>

461
00:21:51.551 --> 00:21:52.750
<v Speaker 2>I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to say,</v>

462
00:21:52.751 --> 00:21:53.584
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to make a living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to really do this fight </v>

463
00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:56.920
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I better start stepping this media thing</v>

464
00:21:56.921 --> 00:21:57.754
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I better start stepping up this portion </v>

465
00:21:59.321 --> 00:22:00.154
<v Speaker 2>that we're doing right here and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out a way to make it because </v>

466
00:22:02.711 --> 00:22:03.544
<v Speaker 2>this is the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is part of the sports where you no </v>

467
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:08.320
<v Speaker 2>longer always fighting who deserves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the best in the world.</v>

468
00:22:08.321 --> 00:22:12.700
<v Speaker 2>You're now fighting in this era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best superstar,</v>

469
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.833
<v Speaker 2>not just the best athlete and so you got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a happy mixture and when you can </v>

470
00:22:17.231 --> 00:22:20.050
<v Speaker 2>figure that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start piecing your career together.</v>

471
00:22:20.051 --> 00:22:22.000
<v Speaker 2>You look at Eric del Faro hasn't figured</v>
<v Speaker 2>that out.</v>

472
00:22:22.001 --> 00:22:22.834
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't care about it and so you </v>

473
00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:25.620
<v Speaker 2>don't know about them too,</v>

474
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.160
<v Speaker 3>what you showed the best people know </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

475
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.000
<v Speaker 3>belt mill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about him rather now it's.</v>

476
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.950
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting thing that you put</v>
<v Speaker 3>that up too because it seems like.</v>

477
00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't just seem like it.</v>

478
00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:40.550
<v Speaker 3>It is both fighters in general and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trainers almost all at one point in time</v>

479
00:22:40.551 --> 00:22:43.140
<v Speaker 3>we're fighters or at least martial </v>
<v Speaker 3>artists.</v>

480
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.113
<v Speaker 3>The there were a lot of them are broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People looking to rebuild and that's </v>

481
00:22:47.751 --> 00:22:48.584
<v Speaker 3>what martial arts Dunn's does for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what fighting and competing does </v>

482
00:22:50.931 --> 00:22:52.160
<v Speaker 3>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives them an identity,</v>

483
00:22:52.161 --> 00:22:57.161
<v Speaker 3>it gives them a sense of purpose and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of a sense of worth and that those</v>

484
00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.333
<v Speaker 3>types of people oftentime get very </v>
<v Speaker 3>selfish and it's very difficult to find </v>

485
00:23:03.831 --> 00:23:07.880
<v Speaker 3>someone that you trust enough to let </v>
<v Speaker 3>them all in and then once they do,</v>

486
00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.220
<v Speaker 3>they're intensely connected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

487
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.143
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the bonds that you have with </v>

488
00:23:12.501 --> 00:23:16.070
<v Speaker 3>people that you train with and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you spar with on a regular basis or</v>

489
00:23:16.071 --> 00:23:18.290
<v Speaker 3>people that you've competed with and </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone to places with.</v>

490
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.573
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people that don't expect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people that have never </v>

491
00:23:22.611 --> 00:23:23.444
<v Speaker 3>experienced such an intense competition </v>
<v Speaker 3>will ever truly understand that kind of </v>

492
00:23:27.051 --> 00:23:28.280
<v Speaker 3>a bomb that people share.</v>

493
00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.730
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ironically,</v>

494
00:23:31.731 --> 00:23:32.564
<v Speaker 2>just by chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much every one of the closest </v>

495
00:23:34.071 --> 00:23:34.904
<v Speaker 2>friends in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have fought almost to a bloody death </v>

496
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:39.163
<v Speaker 2>and that's what's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that and then you can't lie to </v>

497
00:23:42.801 --> 00:23:43.634
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing you're going to lie to </v>

498
00:23:44.781 --> 00:23:47.000
<v Speaker 2>me because if you lie to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to see you on Monday,</v>

499
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.300
<v Speaker 2>80th and we're going to see what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>made of.</v>

500
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 2>You'll know anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

501
00:23:50.871 --> 00:23:52.970
<v Speaker 2>without even knowing what they're made </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

502
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.833
<v Speaker 2>you'll know their lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's different when you fight </v>

503
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:57.830
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you literally know what they're made of.</v>

504
00:23:57.831 --> 00:23:58.664
<v Speaker 2>When you see the look in their eye and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they say what they say and they do what </v>

505
00:24:02.421 --> 00:24:03.254
<v Speaker 2>they do and then they go and they fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't say what they say and </v>

506
00:24:05.031 --> 00:24:05.864
<v Speaker 2>they don't do what they do and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just fighting and that's what's so </v>

507
00:24:08.391 --> 00:24:09.680
<v Speaker 2>refreshing about it to me.</v>

508
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

509
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:12.500
<v Speaker 2>the psychological aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

510
00:24:12.501 --> 00:24:16.100
<v Speaker 2>you know who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was it that said this fighting is 90</v>

511
00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:19.220
<v Speaker 2>percent mental and the other 10 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your head.</v>

512
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I forget who said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember either,</v>

513
00:24:21.531 --> 00:24:23.270
<v Speaker 2>but I heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great quote.</v>

514
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I believe it with all my heart.</v>

515
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:27.163
<v Speaker 2>There's so many people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so incredibly physically </v>

516
00:24:28.851 --> 00:24:29.684
<v Speaker 2>talented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how many Jim assassins do you know </v>

517
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.310
<v Speaker 2>that for whatever reason they just can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it together to care.</v>

518
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.970
<v Speaker 2>When the referee says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter,</v>

519
00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:39.620
<v Speaker 2>are you ready fighter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you ready to go?</v>

520
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:43.370
<v Speaker 2>They just aren't a fraction of who they </v>
<v Speaker 2>really are.</v>

521
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Just really break down and think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens to the ones that do make it</v>

522
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.780
<v Speaker 2>and then have to deal with the media and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

523
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:54.050
<v Speaker 2>opinions and I really feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes,</v>

524
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:54.963
<v Speaker 2>the biggest hurdle is the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're willing to actually just get up </v>

525
00:24:58.671 --> 00:25:02.270
<v Speaker 2>there and say we might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we might lose and just put that out</v>

526
00:25:02.271 --> 00:25:03.104
<v Speaker 2>there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you willing to put yourself out </v>

527
00:25:05.061 --> 00:25:05.894
<v Speaker 2>there like that?</v>

528
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Are you willing to embarrass yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do lose,</v>

529
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.333
<v Speaker 2>are you willing to deal with the media?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you win for 10 years straight and </v>

530
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:16.514
<v Speaker 2>then lose and then now you're the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that's ever been seen in the sport </v>

531
00:25:19.641 --> 00:25:21.680
<v Speaker 2>or the worst female that's ever been </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen the sport.</v>

532
00:25:21.681 --> 00:25:24.950
<v Speaker 2>You didn't even belong there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you able to deal with that?</v>

533
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.160
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what being an athlete is not.</v>

534
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.260
<v Speaker 2>Well those would be an fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Big Difference Between basketball game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's true.</v>

536
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.673
<v Speaker 2>You lose a basketball game and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>might think you're a fucking loser or a </v>

537
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:36.434
<v Speaker 2>scrub,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's nothing like the shit that I </v>

538
00:25:38.241 --> 00:25:40.040
<v Speaker 2>see fighters face online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

539
00:25:40.041 --> 00:25:40.874
<v Speaker 2>I mean just look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to bring Ronda Rousey up because </v>

540
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.870
<v Speaker 2>it's heartbreaking for me as an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what she's feeling,</v>

541
00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:52.640
<v Speaker 2>I know what she's going through and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a female it's even on another level.</v>

542
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.473
<v Speaker 2>I can't really imagine that just it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different level of scrutiny I would </v>

543
00:25:56.451 --> 00:25:58.400
<v Speaker 2>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

544
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:00.253
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shows how hard it is to deal with </v>

545
00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:02.654
<v Speaker 2>this man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ups and downs because the downs hit </v>

546
00:26:06.411 --> 00:26:07.244
<v Speaker 2>hard just as hard as the upset and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to be ready and there can't be any </v>

547
00:26:11.241 --> 00:26:14.420
<v Speaker 2>separation and who you are with a win </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a loss because if there is,</v>

548
00:26:14.421 --> 00:26:15.254
<v Speaker 2>it's going to show and you gotta be who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are and not be solely connected to </v>

549
00:26:19.281 --> 00:26:22.610
<v Speaker 2>fighting as your whole being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you're over when,</v>

550
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.930
<v Speaker 2>when it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it ends,</v>

551
00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:24.973
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was something about the Ronda </v>

552
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Rousey promos that I always felt like I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't like hearing it.</v>

553
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:33.043
<v Speaker 2>Like she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get back to fighting because </v>

554
00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:37.900
<v Speaker 2>it's the most important thing and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that I can be best in the world.</v>

555
00:26:37.901 --> 00:26:38.810
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

556
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.030
<v Speaker 2>I actually like hearing that studio.</v>

557
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.043
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason is it such a lesson if </v>

558
00:26:44.191 --> 00:26:45.024
<v Speaker 2>you really listening in between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines to the issue of the world and </v>

559
00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:50.154
<v Speaker 2>that's just my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all putting so much into this one </v>

560
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:56.640
<v Speaker 2>thing and we think that that is our </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything when really if she.</v>

561
00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.623
<v Speaker 2>It sounds cheesy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you put all that energy towards </v>

562
00:26:59.611 --> 00:27:01.590
<v Speaker 2>loving yourself and not the fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

563
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.410
<v Speaker 2>the fight career will still be there </v>
<v Speaker 2>just as heavy as it is.</v>

564
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

565
00:27:05.821 --> 00:27:06.654
<v Speaker 2>so what I mean is she's using the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting as her identity with that </v>

566
00:27:10.441 --> 00:27:11.274
<v Speaker 2>championship belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is Ronda Rousey the Ronda Rousey </v>

567
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.260
<v Speaker 2>without the championship belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know who she is.</v>

568
00:27:16.261 --> 00:27:19.170
<v Speaker 2>She won't come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who are you?</v>

569
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>

570
00:27:22.501 --> 00:27:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Do you know you're counting on that belt</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know who you are now.</v>

571
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my biggest point.</v>

572
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.750
<v Speaker 2>That was a hurdle I ran into when I lost</v>
<v Speaker 2>my belt.</v>

573
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:34.290
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know who I was anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I knew this.</v>

574
00:27:34.291 --> 00:27:37.140
<v Speaker 2>That's how I figured out what my issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>were is.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you had one of the most horrific injury </v>

584

<v Speaker 3>pound for pound fighters in the world </v>

586
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:05.750
<v Speaker 3>and then you had a series of </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophic injuries and surgeries.</v>

587
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.823
<v Speaker 3>So for this is for a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to podcasts and aren't really </v>

588
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.823
<v Speaker 3>hardcore MMA that makes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you like to talk us through it </v>

589
00:28:13.731 --> 00:28:14.564
<v Speaker 3>because you went through like one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most difficult trials in terms of </v>

590
00:28:18.531 --> 00:28:20.000
<v Speaker 3>recovery from injury?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any?</v>

591
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:21.063
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most difficult I've ever seen </v>

592
00:28:22.371 --> 00:28:26.480
<v Speaker 3>anybody go through and the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>history of my time of colon fights</v>

593
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:27.783
<v Speaker 2>hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely agree in the sport of the </v>

594
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.660
<v Speaker 2>score to the nfl because I researched </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

595
00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

596
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:34.203
<v Speaker 2>These guys who went through three acl </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconstructions came back and compete </v>

597
00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.660
<v Speaker 2>and one of them was just competing on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They almost made it to the superbowl and</v>

598
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:44.410
<v Speaker 2>he had three acl reconstructions in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game of football and came back,</v>

599
00:28:44.411 --> 00:28:46.600
<v Speaker 2>was still playing and he was like over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

600
00:28:46.601 --> 00:28:47.750
<v Speaker 2>over 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

601
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.680
<v Speaker 2>And people like that need to be around </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this world.</v>

602
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to let you know that it's possible.</v>

603
00:28:52.561 --> 00:28:56.650
<v Speaker 2>You know that it can be done in and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of what I what gay.</v>

604
00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.340
<v Speaker 2>That mindset right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you make it bigger than yourself is</v>

605
00:29:00.341 --> 00:29:01.690
<v Speaker 2>the only way you get the power to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

606
00:29:01.691 --> 00:29:02.524
<v Speaker 2>Stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what got me through is </v>

607
00:29:03.491 --> 00:29:07.120
<v Speaker 2>understanding that I go through this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these knee surgeries,</v>

608
00:29:07.121 --> 00:29:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

609
00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.770
<v Speaker 2>I become.</v>

610
00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.410
<v Speaker 2>It becomes bigger than me when I come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and succeed.</v>

611
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.600
<v Speaker 2>It's not just about me coming back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting my belt.</v>

612
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.390
<v Speaker 2>I already had belts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already knew what it felt like to be a</v>

613
00:29:16.391 --> 00:29:19.780
<v Speaker 2>five time world champion by that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the age of 26,</v>

614
00:29:19.781 --> 00:29:22.690
<v Speaker 2>before I blew my knee out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on top of everything.</v>

615
00:29:22.691 --> 00:29:25.080
<v Speaker 2>I had everything that I thought I needed</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one.</v>

616
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:28.420
<v Speaker 2>It blew my knee out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get my belt stripped,</v>

617
00:29:28.421 --> 00:29:33.190
<v Speaker 2>go through three acl reconstructions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You soon find out that you actually have</v>

618
00:29:33.191 --> 00:29:35.220
<v Speaker 2>no idea who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

619
00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.000
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the initial injury?</v>

620
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acl,</v>

621
00:29:39.161 --> 00:29:39.930
<v Speaker 2>MCL.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

622
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:40.900
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened though?</v>

623
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.873
<v Speaker 2>I was a training while I was getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>ready on the ultimate fighter back in </v>

624
00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:47.524
<v Speaker 2>2012 or 11 for Faber fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were getting ready to compete at the </v>

625
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.050
<v Speaker 2>end of the show and I was training with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy and it was just a hard week.</v>

626
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

627
00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:57.983
<v Speaker 2>we were the first show that I ever went </v>
<v Speaker 2>live and was training for the fight at </v>

628
00:30:00.611 --> 00:30:01.444
<v Speaker 2>the same time being tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the only first and only live show </v>

629
00:30:05.441 --> 00:30:06.274
<v Speaker 2>that they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that meant that while we coached we </v>

630
00:30:08.771 --> 00:30:11.140
<v Speaker 2>were also going to compete at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

631
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.423
<v Speaker 2>So like I had to do my fight camp while </v>
<v Speaker 2>I trained the ultimate fighter guys </v>

632
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.580
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was doing four practices a day,</v>

633
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.443
<v Speaker 2>two at the tough guys in tune with </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself and that work load is just </v>

634
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.520
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a hard,</v>

635
00:30:24.521 --> 00:30:27.430
<v Speaker 2>hard training camp and ended up breaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>me down.</v>

636
00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:28.693
<v Speaker 2>I hurt my knee just sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was aspiring day guy went for </v>

637
00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:34.630
<v Speaker 2>graphing transition in my and a Sagd to </v>
<v Speaker 2>my hip,</v>

638
00:30:34.631 --> 00:30:36.810
<v Speaker 2>weird and just blew my knee out a crappy</v>
<v Speaker 2>takedown,</v>

639
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.773
<v Speaker 2>you know where they sag instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually get the take down and it just </v>

640
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:41.320
<v Speaker 2>blew my knee out.</v>

641
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.020
<v Speaker 2>When I blew my acl MCL I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

642
00:30:44.021 --> 00:30:45.310
<v Speaker 2>it's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be fine.</v>

643
00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I fought it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost literally fought injury.</v>

644
00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're too tough.</v>

645
00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:50.860
<v Speaker 2>You're too strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're too young.</v>

646
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:52.690
<v Speaker 2>You can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go for the injury.</v>

647
00:30:52.691 --> 00:30:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Meaning knocked at surgery and try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rehab it.</v>

648
00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:58.120
<v Speaker 2>You just heard what I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it didn't mentally.</v>

649
00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did the surgery?</v>

650
00:30:59.321 --> 00:31:02.230
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't the problem though.</v>

651
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.093
<v Speaker 2>That's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is if you're doing all the </v>

652
00:31:04.991 --> 00:31:05.824
<v Speaker 2>things right to get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's understanding that it was </v>

653
00:31:11.351 --> 00:31:12.184
<v Speaker 2>understanding that I didn't need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight to be better giving up on it was </v>

654
00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:22.141
<v Speaker 2>when I finally got better understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't need fighting to be who I was.</v>

655
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.520
<v Speaker 2>When you say get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean get better emotionally,</v>

656
00:31:24.521 --> 00:31:28.450
<v Speaker 2>psychologically will physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even physically.</v>

657
00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.343
<v Speaker 2>So physically I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not get better until I gave up on </v>

658
00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:35.890
<v Speaker 2>fighting the injury and what I mean by </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting the injuries saying it's,</v>

659
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.270
<v Speaker 2>you'll be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll come back,</v>

660
00:31:37.271 --> 00:31:38.380
<v Speaker 2>just keep training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep training,</v>

661
00:31:38.381 --> 00:31:39.220
<v Speaker 2>keep training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep training.</v>

662
00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:44.420
<v Speaker 2>And I and I trained but in the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the logic that I was given with my,</v>

663
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:46.923
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm allowed to do according to my </v>

664
00:31:48.641 --> 00:31:50.140
<v Speaker 2>physical therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gavin Mcmillan,</v>

665
00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Speaker 2>he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do this,</v>

666
00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:52.570
<v Speaker 2>this and this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't push it.</v>

667
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.610
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't push it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do the things aloud,</v>

668
00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.470
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

669
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:57.423
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The issue was surrendering to the issue </v>

670
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:03.490
<v Speaker 2>is knowing that fighting was the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>way I was going to be happy.</v>

671
00:32:03.491 --> 00:32:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Then it was being able to compete was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way I could find peace.</v>

672
00:32:08.111 --> 00:32:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Being able to prove that I was as good </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I always was,</v>

673
00:32:10.121 --> 00:32:15.121
<v Speaker 2>even after the injuries became </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that I was trying to do it.</v>

674
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.570
<v Speaker 2>It was just a nonstop fight to just get </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>

675
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:25.410
<v Speaker 2>And I get through my second acl </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconstruction on the same knee.</v>

676
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Then I blow my quad out before I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to fight.</v>

677
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.190
<v Speaker 2>How did you blow out the second one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

678
00:32:31.191 --> 00:32:33.070
<v Speaker 2>you had the injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had it reconstructed.</v>

679
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:35.020
<v Speaker 2>And then how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you blow out the second one?</v>

680
00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.213
<v Speaker 2>It's the same knee and I was training on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas how many months after the </v>

681
00:32:42.141 --> 00:32:43.910
<v Speaker 2>initial surgery?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six.</v>

682
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:44.773
<v Speaker 2>So it's real reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not 100 percent healed </v>

683
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:47.720
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not 100 percent healed yet.</v>

684
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.860
<v Speaker 2>Nine months is supposed to be full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full strength,</v>

685
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:53.743
<v Speaker 2>but that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But six month is when you get to start </v>

686
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:56.503
<v Speaker 2>pushing it to get ready to fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you're like six months to six </v>

687
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:00.824
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to do any kind of </v>

688
00:33:01.311 --> 00:33:03.290
<v Speaker 2>cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connie.</v>

689
00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Meeting science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lateral movements just straight down the</v>

690
00:33:06.111 --> 00:33:06.710
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

691
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.210
<v Speaker 2>nothing risky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

692
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:11.150
<v Speaker 2>keep your brace on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you trained at a six month mark,</v>

693
00:33:11.151 --> 00:33:12.170
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the brace off.</v>

694
00:33:12.171 --> 00:33:13.970
<v Speaker 2>You've got to start getting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stabilizers strong.</v>

695
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:16.430
<v Speaker 2>You can start testing it more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can start doing things,</v>

696
00:33:16.431 --> 00:33:20.030
<v Speaker 2>but you still got to wear a brace when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do live scenarios.</v>

697
00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:21.530
<v Speaker 2>But you can drill without it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

698
00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:22.400
<v Speaker 2>you see what I'm saying?</v>

699
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:23.323
<v Speaker 2>So you're actually pretty strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now it's supposed to be strong </v>

700
00:33:25.731 --> 00:33:30.110
<v Speaker 2>enough that it's not going to tear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's when I had a cadaver acl,</v>

701
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.840
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't as strong as it should have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been at that,</v>

702
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:35.560
<v Speaker 2>at that six month point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was cadaver tissue.</v>

703
00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.480
<v Speaker 2>My Body did not adapt to the tissue as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well as it could have.</v>

704
00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:40.863
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they do an Mri to see where it's at </v>

705
00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:45.500
<v Speaker 2>or do they just kind of base it on how </v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels?</v>

706
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.753
<v Speaker 2>They base it on the endpoint and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stability of your knee and then </v>

707
00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:52.160
<v Speaker 2>manipulate it when they manipulate it at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the six month mark,</v>

708
00:33:52.161 --> 00:33:52.994
<v Speaker 2>you're going in every two to three weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>for six months to double check with the </v>

709
00:33:56.211 --> 00:33:57.044
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had to have a two week while I was </v>

710
00:33:58.671 --> 00:34:02.090
<v Speaker 2>doing that at Kerlan and jobe and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were good doctors and they tried to stay</v>

711
00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:02.924
<v Speaker 2>on me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

712
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've had two.</v>

713
00:34:05.031 --> 00:34:06.770
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

714
00:34:06.771 --> 00:34:07.604
<v Speaker 2>at the six month mark it's like you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>push it but you don't want to overkill </v>

715
00:34:11.961 --> 00:34:12.794
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tear it.</v>

716
00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:14.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the second one,</v>

717
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:17.510
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't over killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was doing what I was allowed in my</v>

718
00:34:17.511 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 2>brace and I made a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a cut,</v>

719
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.860
<v Speaker 2>like a turn and it just popped it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

720
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.550
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't anything like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh I shouldn't have been doing that.</v>

721
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.050
<v Speaker 2>It was Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

722
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.870
<v Speaker 2>I was boxing in my brace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had it taped,</v>

723
00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:35.960
<v Speaker 2>I warmed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I surprised I was uh,</v>

724
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.190
<v Speaker 2>doing drills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing drills,</v>

725
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:38.010
<v Speaker 2>drills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

726
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:38.843
<v Speaker 2>boxing drills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you just pivot wrong then and it </v>

727
00:34:41.841 --> 00:34:42.980
<v Speaker 2>just pops and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

728
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.080
<v Speaker 2>like I remember sitting there and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

729
00:34:45.081 --> 00:34:48.620
<v Speaker 2>the pain's very specific and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes away too quick.</v>

730
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.573
<v Speaker 2>That's when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

731
00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.840
<v Speaker 2>because it's their real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

732
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:52.040
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real hard pain.</v>

733
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:52.873
<v Speaker 2>And then it goes away in like two </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes because the ligaments that now </v>

734
00:34:55.281 --> 00:34:56.420
<v Speaker 2>you don't have pain anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

735
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:59.330
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I sit down and I go,</v>

736
00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:00.500
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my name is torn.</v>

737
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.130
<v Speaker 2>And that was when I hit like a real bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>rock bottom on that one.</v>

738
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:06.710
<v Speaker 2>That was like that one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

739
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.530
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I went to the MRI and got home,</v>

740
00:35:09.531 --> 00:35:13.880
<v Speaker 2>I literally like called my friend and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>told him to come over and I just,</v>

741
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:14.923
<v Speaker 2>I mean I pretty much just drink as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a bottle as I could because I was in </v>

742
00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:20.120
<v Speaker 2>pretty good shape at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it put me out.</v>

743
00:35:20.121 --> 00:35:20.954
<v Speaker 2>I passed out my head was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I woke up in my porch with my head on </v>

744
00:35:23.661 --> 00:35:25.370
<v Speaker 2>the grill in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a mess.</v>

745
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:28.310
<v Speaker 2>It was not pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't even care because I was out</v>

746
00:35:28.311 --> 00:35:29.490
<v Speaker 2>for nine months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

747
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:33.090
<v Speaker 2>so everybody hits these lows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

748
00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.780
<v Speaker 2>what were you doing financially back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then?</v>

749
00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Because that's where it gets rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

750
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.920
<v Speaker 2>That's another part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

751
00:35:38.921 --> 00:35:41.130
<v Speaker 2>US athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all know or you know,</v>

752
00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

753
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.850
<v Speaker 2>we only make money when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we fight for the prize,</v>

754
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:46.420
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

755
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.941
<v Speaker 2>thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

756
00:35:47.941 --> 00:35:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Lorenzo and in the UFC they gave me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decent chunk of money for a good part of</v>

757
00:35:52.681 --> 00:35:53.514
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I had the belt and then once they </v>

758
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.793
<v Speaker 2>took the belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped getting that chunk of money </v>

759
00:35:57.061 --> 00:35:57.894
<v Speaker 2>even when I was hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were paying me a little bit a </v>

760
00:35:59.561 --> 00:36:01.680
<v Speaker 2>stipend while I was hurt and that helped</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

761
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.873
<v Speaker 2>And then when I left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they stripped the belt and gave it </v>

762
00:36:04.201 --> 00:36:05.034
<v Speaker 2>to broad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stopped with that because I'm not </v>

763
00:36:06.781 --> 00:36:08.910
<v Speaker 2>the champion anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it was kinda like,</v>

764
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.050
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I mean,</v>

765
00:36:10.051 --> 00:36:11.910
<v Speaker 2>that's when it Kinda went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got turned reality.</v>

766
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not the champ on paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

767
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.550
<v Speaker 2>He didn't really lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's it.</v>

768
00:36:17.551 --> 00:36:19.770
<v Speaker 2>So what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this it,</v>

769
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you're going to make money,</v>

770
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:22.800
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to do that?</v>

771
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.530
<v Speaker 2>And I panicked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

772
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.370
<v Speaker 2>but I knew that I was gonna still come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and fight because I was still young</v>

773
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:33.210
<v Speaker 2>and I hadn't given up on fighting yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still only in my second acl surgery.</v>

774
00:36:33.211 --> 00:36:36.570
<v Speaker 2>So I'm still not fully admitting that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

775
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.420
<v Speaker 2>that I'm a mess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

776
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of not really like admitting it</v>

777
00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:42.990
<v Speaker 2>to myself yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

778
00:36:42.991 --> 00:36:44.300
<v Speaker 2>screw what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else's,</v>

779
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:46.620
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what you believe to yourself is all</v>

780
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:47.520
<v Speaker 2>that matters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

781
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

782
00:36:49.231 --> 00:36:50.700
<v Speaker 2>I'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't that bad.</v>

783
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:51.690
<v Speaker 2>I can do this.</v>

784
00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Gone through worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in doing it,</v>

785
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.170
<v Speaker 2>I still hadn't really just given up yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's.</v>

786
00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.900
<v Speaker 2>So I'm still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still competing in my mind,</v>

787
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.400
<v Speaker 2>which is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

788
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:04.343
<v Speaker 2>that's when you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're overworking and not just doing </v>

789
00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:09.000
<v Speaker 2>things you're not supposed to on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>knee.</v>

790
00:37:09.001 --> 00:37:12.180
<v Speaker 2>But just in general in life on just </v>
<v Speaker 2>overworking.</v>

791
00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing my Fox stuff now to make money</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm trying to do my rehab,</v>

792
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.083
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five days a week because I have to come </v>

793
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:19.920
<v Speaker 2>back and fight for the belt when I come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

794
00:37:19.921 --> 00:37:23.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's another thing people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>equate as I was the champs.</v>

795
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.480
<v Speaker 2>I got to come back and fight for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>belt.</v>

796
00:37:24.481 --> 00:37:25.314
<v Speaker 2>When I come back after this injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't just get to come back and fight </v>

797
00:37:27.241 --> 00:37:28.074
<v Speaker 2>somebody three rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to come back and fight five </v>

798
00:37:30.061 --> 00:37:32.220
<v Speaker 2>rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never been done before.</v>

799
00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.200
<v Speaker 2>I had nobody to bounce this thought off </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

800
00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:36.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had to wing it man.</v>

801
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.110
<v Speaker 2>And so I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that caused,</v>

802
00:37:40.111 --> 00:37:40.944
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of problems with me because I </v>

803
00:37:41.551 --> 00:37:42.384
<v Speaker 2>didn't have the mental capacity to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it at that point with all the </v>

804
00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:45.894
<v Speaker 2>things that I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just kept grinding and then I </v>

805
00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:51.540
<v Speaker 2>finally get back to health after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second acl,</v>

806
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.930
<v Speaker 2>six months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine months goes by.</v>

807
00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:56.700
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take this brow fight.</v>

808
00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.130
<v Speaker 2>So I'm ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm training in camp.</v>

809
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:04.160
<v Speaker 2>About a month in m I t I have like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird pinch in my groin.</v>

810
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:06.600
<v Speaker 2>It turns out to be the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 2>injury.</v>

811
00:38:06.601 --> 00:38:07.434
<v Speaker 2>Daniel cormier just pulled out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight for it's the extensor tendon in </v>

812
00:38:11.271 --> 00:38:12.240
<v Speaker 2>your or?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

813
00:38:12.241 --> 00:38:14.310
<v Speaker 2>it's the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

814
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.490
<v Speaker 2>I forget the name of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a tendon in your groin area that</v>

815
00:38:17.491 --> 00:38:19.020
<v Speaker 2>pulls and then you got to just rest it.</v>

816
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:24.500
<v Speaker 2>I tore the mine was a little bit worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tore the muscle,</v>

817
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.500
<v Speaker 2>the quad muscle off the bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like separated from the bone,</v>

818
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:31.320
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just enough that it was,</v>

819
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:32.573
<v Speaker 2>I could still like think I was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it would fail on me occasionally so </v>

820
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I could tape it some days and it would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be all right.</v>

821
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Shoot a bunch of Toradol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

822
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:42.280
<v Speaker 2>for anybody who's curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a natural.</v>

823
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:43.180
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

824
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.040
<v Speaker 2>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti-inflammatory.</v>

825
00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:47.080
<v Speaker 2>A lot of football players take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

826
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Toridol Toridol it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

827
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:51.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

828
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.320
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>

829
00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:55.770
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a natural urge to anti-inflammatory</v>

830
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:56.501
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Natural one,</v>

831
00:38:56.501 --> 00:39:00.070
<v Speaker 2>but it's like Ibuprofen but stronger and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would take that and that helped.</v>

832
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just,</v>

833
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:04.593
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was sparring one day and I </v>

834
00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:07.324
<v Speaker 2>went to throw a right hand and my leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>just gave out and I fell on the floor </v>

835
00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.860
<v Speaker 2>and I wasn't kicking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't shooting.</v>

836
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:16.360
<v Speaker 2>I just threw a right hand and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling of falling because I threw right</v>

837
00:39:16.361 --> 00:39:17.360
<v Speaker 2>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made me know,</v>

838
00:39:17.361 --> 00:39:18.194
<v Speaker 2>like something wasn't connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it just didn't feel right because </v>

839
00:39:21.101 --> 00:39:22.570
<v Speaker 2>they just failed me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>

840
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:23.763
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like it hurt and I stopped it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just literally there was no pain and it </v>

841
00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:28.600
<v Speaker 2>just failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

842
00:39:28.601 --> 00:39:30.730
<v Speaker 2>something's way mechanically wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

843
00:39:30.731 --> 00:39:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I can't fight mechanically wrong like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

844
00:39:33.221 --> 00:39:35.530
<v Speaker 2>And that was about four weeks out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

845
00:39:35.531 --> 00:39:36.730
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four weeks out of the fight.</v>

846
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.250
<v Speaker 2>I had already done a month camp with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this injury,</v>

847
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.410
<v Speaker 2>trying to tough it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my camp was rough.</v>

848
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.780
<v Speaker 2>It was a heart camp and I didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull out,</v>

849
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.673
<v Speaker 2>obviously naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up calling Dana and in this </v>

850
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:50.370
<v Speaker 2>one of the few phone calls I've ever had</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Dana.</v>

851
00:39:50.371 --> 00:39:51.204
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably one of the times you remember </v>

852
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.670
<v Speaker 2>telling them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry I got to pull out.</v>

853
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.680
<v Speaker 2>But I remember not wanting to have my </v>
<v Speaker 2>manager column this.</v>

854
00:39:57.681 --> 00:39:58.514
<v Speaker 2>This goes back to what my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how my mom put something in my head </v>

855
00:40:01.391 --> 00:40:04.110
<v Speaker 2>where you deal with this face to face or</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

856
00:40:04.111 --> 00:40:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Psychologist said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

857
00:40:05.081 --> 00:40:06.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got to pull out of this fight.</v>

858
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.500
<v Speaker 2>I need some doc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need.</v>

859
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:10.540
<v Speaker 2>If you've got any doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have an Mri,</v>

860
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:11.383
<v Speaker 2>me whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling you something's wrong </v>

861
00:40:12.551 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 2>with my leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's like,</v>

862
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:15.010
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>

863
00:40:15.011 --> 00:40:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got guys on it.</v>

864
00:40:16.031 --> 00:40:17.950
<v Speaker 2>We can have pulled out now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're fine.</v>

865
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the doctors,</v>

866
00:40:19.541 --> 00:40:20.111
<v Speaker 2>check it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

867
00:40:20.111 --> 00:40:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your quads torn.</v>

868
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.830
<v Speaker 2>You can't fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the UFC pulls me,</v>

869
00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dane is naturally pissed,</v>

870
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:28.810
<v Speaker 2>but then that slide's a favor in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>favor,</v>

871
00:40:28.811 --> 00:40:32.080
<v Speaker 2>gets the shot with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with brow ends up getting knocked out in</v>

872
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:32.914
<v Speaker 2>that match up.</v>

873
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.680
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pull out of that fight and that's when</v>

874
00:40:35.681 --> 00:40:36.514
<v Speaker 2>they stripped my belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that was the beginning of me </v>

875
00:40:38.621 --> 00:40:39.454
<v Speaker 2>giving up on fighting to an extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I mean by that is it's </v>

876
00:40:45.401 --> 00:40:47.200
<v Speaker 2>different than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds negative,</v>

877
00:40:47.201 --> 00:40:48.034
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say that I'm giving up on </v>

878
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:49.413
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was actually the building point </v>

879
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.190
<v Speaker 2>in my life where I finally let go of </v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

880
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I always had this thing up to that point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I wanted to control everything.</v>

881
00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.273
<v Speaker 2>It's just something that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always had the gift of being able to </v>

882
00:41:02.921 --> 00:41:07.921
<v Speaker 2>do this last one after the two acl </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconstructive surgeries coming back and</v>

883
00:41:08.861 --> 00:41:11.920
<v Speaker 2>then tearing my quad after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said like,</v>

884
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what else you want me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

885
00:41:13.181 --> 00:41:15.550
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten through two acl </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconstructions.</v>

886
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my higher power is God.</v>

887
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:19.900
<v Speaker 2>So I'm praying at this point saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you want me to do.</v>

888
00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:21.940
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking to God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

889
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:23.470
<v Speaker 2>like what are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I gotta do?</v>

890
00:41:23.471 --> 00:41:23.771
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

891
00:41:23.771 --> 00:41:25.530
<v Speaker 2>do you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

892
00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:27.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm in this for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for reasons bigger than myself.</v>

893
00:41:27.761 --> 00:41:31.090
<v Speaker 2>I want to come back and show people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this can be done.</v>

894
00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the only one that can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can do this,</v>

895
00:41:33.351 --> 00:41:34.184
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here for you doing bidding your </v>

896
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:37.700
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

897
00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.690
<v Speaker 2>this is my talking and no answers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no nothing.</v>

898
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:45.110
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's the answer.</v>

899
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:46.303
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's the answer is just you </v>

900
00:41:48.141 --> 00:41:50.510
<v Speaker 2>might not ever fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you okay with that?</v>

901
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:51.793
<v Speaker 2>And now something that I never allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain to even go to ever until all </v>

902
00:41:56.121 --> 00:41:59.660
<v Speaker 2>these injuries hit me and I would've </v>
<v Speaker 2>never been able to unless I went through</v>

903
00:41:59.661 --> 00:42:00.494
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was literally all this stuff </v>

904
00:42:02.181 --> 00:42:03.014
<v Speaker 2>because I'm so stubborn and so just </v>
<v Speaker 2>tough that I had to go through all that </v>

905
00:42:07.131 --> 00:42:09.140
<v Speaker 2>just to mentally say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

906
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:10.580
<v Speaker 2>you might never do this again.</v>

907
00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:13.160
<v Speaker 2>It could have been after the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could've done that,</v>

908
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.190
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I did that,</v>

909
00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 2>my health skyrocketed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Immediately.</v>

910
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.023
<v Speaker 2>I started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just went to therapy everyday knowing </v>

911
00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:23.163
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't care if I fought again or </v>

912
00:42:24.561 --> 00:42:25.394
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I focused all my energy and Fox and </v>

913
00:42:27.531 --> 00:42:31.810
<v Speaker 2>coaching the guys at Alliance Training </v>
<v Speaker 2>Center to make them better and uh,</v>

914
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:34.330
<v Speaker 2>try to make the team better so that when</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

915
00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:35.183
<v Speaker 2>and feed off the thirst and the hunger </v>
<v Speaker 2>that those guys had to be the champion </v>

916
00:42:38.421 --> 00:42:40.490
<v Speaker 2>that I still wanted to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I and I,</v>

917
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:41.563
<v Speaker 2>I decided that if I focused on Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>focused on the positive energy of these </v>

918
00:42:45.081 --> 00:42:47.060
<v Speaker 2>guys at the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept training.</v>

919
00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.600
<v Speaker 2>I kept my mind in the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

920
00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:54.630
<v Speaker 2>my body will be there because my age is </v>
<v Speaker 2>compliant with my body still.</v>

921
00:42:55.161 --> 00:42:56.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm still young enough that I'll be </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

922
00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:00.220
<v Speaker 2>So I just needed to get my mind wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the sport,</v>

923
00:43:00.221 --> 00:43:01.054
<v Speaker 2>stay in it mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but understand that if I never have it </v>

924
00:43:03.111 --> 00:43:04.100
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's okay too.</v>

925
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:05.443
<v Speaker 2>And when I did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took away so much importance off of </v>

926
00:43:09.021 --> 00:43:12.320
<v Speaker 2>needing to fight as have the title as </v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

927
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:15.580
<v Speaker 2>as the person that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it allowed me to open up and say,</v>

928
00:43:15.581 --> 00:43:17.420
<v Speaker 2>if you never fight again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still a great person.</v>

929
00:43:17.421 --> 00:43:18.254
<v Speaker 2>You still did great things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still a laid the tracks for the </v>

930
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Bantam Weight Division and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

931
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did this,</v>

932
00:43:25.861 --> 00:43:28.940
<v Speaker 2>that you had a great career dome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's okay if this is it.</v>

933
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.033
<v Speaker 2>And I kept that mindset kept focusing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that I could control instead </v>

934
00:43:35.121 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 2>of the things that I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

935
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:37.483
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I wasn't competing yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as I did that I got healthier and </v>

936
00:43:40.761 --> 00:43:41.150
<v Speaker 2>healthier.</v>

937
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.983
<v Speaker 2>Came back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot Docu that set me up to fight Ms </v>

938
00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:45.203
<v Speaker 2>Dot Jackie then destroyed ms dot Dr. One</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your best performances over first </v>

939
00:43:50.001 --> 00:43:50.834
<v Speaker 2>round destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the most at peace of felt in a </v>

940
00:43:53.361 --> 00:43:54.194
<v Speaker 2>long time walking in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember interviewing you after the </v>

941
00:43:56.001 --> 00:43:58.040
<v Speaker 2>fight and you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember what happened.</v>

942
00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:00.350
<v Speaker 2>She just went like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went into a trance.</v>

943
00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:01.213
<v Speaker 2>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the weirdest performances </v>

944
00:44:03.321 --> 00:44:04.154
<v Speaker 2>in my whole career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily because the lockout was </v>

945
00:44:06.951 --> 00:44:10.160
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just I was so excited.</v>

946
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I had no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no connection.</v>

947
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:13.003
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no connection to the win or the </v>

948
00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:15.260
<v Speaker 2>loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At that point.</v>

949
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:16.573
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just I was just there to enjoy </v>

950
00:44:19.611 --> 00:44:20.444
<v Speaker 2>being there again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After three and a half years and all </v>

951
00:44:21.801 --> 00:44:24.500
<v Speaker 2>these injuries like I can't believe I </v>
<v Speaker 2>made it here.</v>

952
00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm not injured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I remember thinking like,</v>

953
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.470
<v Speaker 2>just you're in front of these people.</v>

954
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Enjoy the man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enjoy this ride.</v>

955
00:44:32.671 --> 00:44:33.504
<v Speaker 2>Like this is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people that would pay millions </v>

956
00:44:35.551 --> 00:44:36.384
<v Speaker 2>and trillions of dollars to get this </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk you're about to get and go fight </v>

957
00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:40.920
<v Speaker 2>somebody this octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just enjoy it.</v>

958
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't connect and by letting go,</v>

959
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:45.030
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by letting go of the injuries,</v>

960
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:47.710
<v Speaker 2>by letting go of the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by letting go of the loss,</v>

961
00:44:47.711 --> 00:44:50.420
<v Speaker 2>by letting go of either mattered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the.</v>

962
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I was in my zone and it allowed me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just be free and I was.</v>

963
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:56.610
<v Speaker 2>That was the best performance in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

964
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:57.743
<v Speaker 2>but more than anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it showed me a mental thing that I'd </v>

965
00:45:00.391 --> 00:45:01.224
<v Speaker 2>never opened up before and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>letting go of the things that you can't </v>

966
00:45:05.311 --> 00:45:06.144
<v Speaker 2>control will give you actually more </v>
<v Speaker 2>peace because it disconnects you from </v>

967
00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:13.763
<v Speaker 2>what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you feel like that piece was a </v>

968
00:45:15.571 --> 00:45:16.404
<v Speaker 2>significant factor in your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>recovering because the pressure and the </v>

969
00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:23.550
<v Speaker 2>stress and the anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that was playing.</v>

970
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:28.290
<v Speaker 2>It was wrecking not just your mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>state but also your physical state.</v>

971
00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:31.650
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent every piece of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really interesting.</v>

972
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:32.693
<v Speaker 2>Every piece of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the biggest thing I learned </v>

973
00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:37.650
<v Speaker 2>is that is like it wasn't my physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

974
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:39.870
<v Speaker 2>It was my mind doing it to my physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

975
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.823
<v Speaker 2>So it was initially a physical injury </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it was the cascade of </v>

976
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:47.720
<v Speaker 2>psychological issues that came with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical issue,</v>

977
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.033
<v Speaker 2>some more physical issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the cascade of trying to figure </v>

978
00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:54.144
<v Speaker 2>out why I was so sad with all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I earned around me that I </v>

979
00:45:57.241 --> 00:45:58.770
<v Speaker 2>already had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that I thought,</v>

980
00:45:58.771 --> 00:46:02.580
<v Speaker 2>like when you grow up in a trailer like </v>
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

981
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:06.300
<v Speaker 2>and then you go to winning a Gtr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that car you wanted since you were a kid</v>

982
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.193
<v Speaker 2>in a prize fight and having a home that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you bought with your own money that you </v>

983
00:46:11.491 --> 00:46:14.100
<v Speaker 2>never thought you'd be able to own a </v>
<v Speaker 2>home in California because you live in a</v>

984
00:46:14.101 --> 00:46:15.690
<v Speaker 2>damn trailer park in Tucson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arizona.</v>

985
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.110
<v Speaker 2>It kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

986
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:22.980
<v Speaker 2>makes you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's it,</v>

987
00:46:22.981 --> 00:46:23.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

988
00:46:23.691 --> 00:46:24.524
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done crazy great things and </v>

989
00:46:27.301 --> 00:46:28.960
<v Speaker 2>you've um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

990
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.280
<v Speaker 2>those were all dreams to me and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened so quick,</v>

991
00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.080
<v Speaker 2>like at 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

992
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get my house to later,</v>

993
00:46:35.611 --> 00:46:39.300
<v Speaker 2>but when I got those things it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you.</v>

994
00:46:39.301 --> 00:46:41.760
<v Speaker 2>So I was still sad is my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was still,</v>

995
00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I had my depression that was hitting me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

996
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:47.670
<v Speaker 2>and that's so many people in this world </v>
<v Speaker 2>are dealing with depression.</v>

997
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a huge catastrophic problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the planet.</v>

998
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.930
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely,</v>

999
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:56.730
<v Speaker 2>it's in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in my blood line,</v>

1000
00:46:56.731 --> 00:46:59.520
<v Speaker 2>on both sides of my family and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that everybody,</v>

1001
00:46:59.521 --> 00:47:01.770
<v Speaker 2>not just myself deals with on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis,</v>

1002
00:47:01.771 --> 00:47:02.604
<v Speaker 2>I think in certain people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that hit me very hard and I didn't </v>

1003
00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:10.050
<v Speaker 2>understand why it hit me so much harder </v>
<v Speaker 2>now after I stopped competing.</v>

1004
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Like why am I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is,</v>

1005
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.593
<v Speaker 2>why is it so much worse now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While the reason is my body was used to </v>

1006
00:47:16.081 --> 00:47:18.780
<v Speaker 2>the active,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the activity just go,</v>

1007
00:47:18.781 --> 00:47:19.590
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

1008
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:20.423
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I realized is I turned off all my </v>

1009
00:47:22.411 --> 00:47:23.244
<v Speaker 2>emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual and mental issues with </v>

1010
00:47:25.651 --> 00:47:29.010
<v Speaker 2>exercise to where I never ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever dealt with them ever.</v>

1011
00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:35.020
<v Speaker 2>I only physically worked them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my physical was perfection.</v>

1012
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.240
<v Speaker 2>I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a world champion,</v>

1013
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:39.220
<v Speaker 2>monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killer,</v>

1014
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.190
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call me in your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>respective mind,</v>

1015
00:47:42.191 --> 00:47:44.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But emotionally,</v>

1016
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:45.333
<v Speaker 2>physically and spiritually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at cricket and I'd never </v>

1017
00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:52.390
<v Speaker 2>understood that until I was hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped in my own body.</v>

1018
00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Like a prison cell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't train,</v>

1019
00:47:54.761 --> 00:47:56.020
<v Speaker 2>couldn't run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't walk,</v>

1020
00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.110
<v Speaker 2>couldn't bend my leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laying on the couch,</v>

1021
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:00.910
<v Speaker 2>eating pain pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing,</v>

1022
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:02.740
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you train,</v>

1023
00:48:02.741 --> 00:48:04.480
<v Speaker 2>unless you compete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hate yourself,</v>

1024
00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:06.320
<v Speaker 2>you hate yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1025
00:48:06.321 --> 00:48:09.310
<v Speaker 2>you're a piece of shit in your own mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>without those things,</v>

1026
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:12.430
<v Speaker 2>without the beautiful girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without the beautiful house,</v>

1027
00:48:12.431 --> 00:48:13.264
<v Speaker 2>without the Nice cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without them big money to show people </v>

1028
00:48:15.761 --> 00:48:17.050
<v Speaker 2>you hate yourself.</v>

1029
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:20.920
<v Speaker 2>So what am I really doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I doing this?</v>

1030
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:24.310
<v Speaker 2>I lost sight that the whole reason we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting is,</v>

1031
00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.470
<v Speaker 2>is it's a spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional,</v>

1032
00:48:26.471 --> 00:48:27.304
<v Speaker 2>physical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental battle that helps you grow as an </v>

1033
00:48:29.051 --> 00:48:29.884
<v Speaker 2>individual and as a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just to have these things that </v>

1034
00:48:32.471 --> 00:48:33.304
<v Speaker 2>you think will make you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to learn those things through </v>

1035
00:48:35.801 --> 00:48:36.634
<v Speaker 2>the process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't know that until I was </v>

1036
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:39.454
<v Speaker 2>trapped in my own body and I literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt like I was in a prison cell and I </v>

1037
00:48:41.891 --> 00:48:42.724
<v Speaker 2>knew that wasn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't be in our own body alone </v>

1038
00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:48.243
<v Speaker 2>without people around us to keep us </v>
<v Speaker 2>company and a on a couch feeling like </v>

1039
00:48:53.051 --> 00:48:54.370
<v Speaker 2>we're in a prison cell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should we?</v>

1040
00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:55.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely not.</v>

1041
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't,</v>

1042
00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:00.460
<v Speaker 2>but I did for three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how did you get yourself out of it by</v>

1043
00:49:00.461 --> 00:49:02.260
<v Speaker 2>just accepting it and you must.</v>

1044
00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.730
<v Speaker 2>There must've been some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism that caused.</v>

1045
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.200
<v Speaker 2>I have people that I talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professionals,</v>

1046
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:09.703
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously like sports psychologists or </v>

1047
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.823
<v Speaker 2>sports psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you got to get a psychologist </v>

1048
00:49:14.321 --> 00:49:16.810
<v Speaker 2>in general to deal with the depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1049
00:49:16.811 --> 00:49:19.290
<v Speaker 2>When you hit your lows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's okay to,</v>

1050
00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:20.410
<v Speaker 2>to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1051
00:49:20.411 --> 00:49:24.370
<v Speaker 2>if you're bench pressing 350 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's okay to have a little touch.</v>

1052
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.080
<v Speaker 2>It's okay to have a little spot here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1053
00:49:26.081 --> 00:49:26.914
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then after you get a couple of </v>

1054
00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.730
<v Speaker 2>spots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now after awhile you can do it yourself.</v>

1055
00:49:30.731 --> 00:49:34.240
<v Speaker 2>You don't need the spot anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I look at psychiatric help to</v>

1056
00:49:34.241 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 2>an extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some people,</v>

1057
00:49:35.321 --> 00:49:36.790
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're battling </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

1058
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:37.833
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you just need a floaty and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>did and then you can take the floaties </v>

1059
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.520
<v Speaker 2>off after a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what I'm saying?</v>

1060
00:49:42.521 --> 00:49:43.354
<v Speaker 2>It's a mental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a mental floaty and it's okay </v>

1061
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:50.200
<v Speaker 2>because we all hit low part low points </v>
<v Speaker 2>in our life where it's unbearable.</v>

1062
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:53.590
<v Speaker 2>And you either allow it to continue to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be unbearable and just deny it,</v>

1063
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:55.620
<v Speaker 2>or you deal with the task at hand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1064
00:49:55.621 --> 00:49:57.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little low right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need the floaties.</v>

1065
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:59.350
<v Speaker 2>It's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get through this.</v>

1066
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.393
<v Speaker 2>And then when you take the is off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize I only needed them for a </v>

1067
00:50:02.261 --> 00:50:04.540
<v Speaker 2>little bit of time and now I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>

1068
00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.673
<v Speaker 2>And that's Kinda what it felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I just needed a little bit of </v>

1069
00:50:08.141 --> 00:50:08.974
<v Speaker 2>a push.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I needed to get through this and learn </v>

1070
00:50:10.601 --> 00:50:11.434
<v Speaker 2>some things about my own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own mind and understand my own </v>

1071
00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:15.603
<v Speaker 2>emotions and understand that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>need all these things that I was </v>

1072
00:50:18.371 --> 00:50:21.340
<v Speaker 2>thinking where it real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was me not being in control of my own</v>

1073
00:50:21.341 --> 00:50:23.710
<v Speaker 2>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own emotions or your choice.</v>

1074
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:27.040
<v Speaker 2>And I chose to feel trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I chose to be sad.</v>

1075
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:29.210
<v Speaker 2>I chose to feel like I was Jack Shit.</v>

1076
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:30.043
<v Speaker 2>I chose all these things and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need fighting to be these </v>

1077
00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:33.764
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to.</v>

1078
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:37.040
<v Speaker 2>You need to let go of fighting to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you are something without it.</v>

1079
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:38.713
<v Speaker 2>And that was actually a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It became a gift because I learned so </v>

1080
00:50:42.321 --> 00:50:47.270
<v Speaker 2>much in life now bigger than fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at the things that I went through</v>

1081
00:50:47.271 --> 00:50:52.271
<v Speaker 2>as a gift because I have gotten the gift</v>
<v Speaker 2>of feeling retired during my career.</v>

1082
00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Who else gets that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people retire for five years,</v>

1083
00:51:00.801 --> 00:51:01.634
<v Speaker 2>lose their freaking mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>end up in the bar and come back and try </v>

1084
00:51:03.411 --> 00:51:05.960
<v Speaker 2>to fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ten years later with a weakened body,</v>

1085
00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.390
<v Speaker 2>a mess or abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1086
00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.493
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Though?</v>

1087
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:10.573
<v Speaker 2>Why are they doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing it because they're </v>

1088
00:51:11.541 --> 00:51:12.374
<v Speaker 2>physically capable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing it because they never </v>

1089
00:51:13.761 --> 00:51:15.470
<v Speaker 2>dealt with their life away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

1090
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Fighting was there like fighting is who </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

1091
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.660
<v Speaker 2>Fighting is their persona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So takeaway fighting.</v>

1092
00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:24.020
<v Speaker 2>What are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in the bar drinking away with.</v>

1093
00:51:24.021 --> 00:51:26.690
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of drinking,</v>

1094
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:29.690
<v Speaker 2>putting the booze down and knowing what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are without fighting,</v>

1095
00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:33.350
<v Speaker 2>being happy with that chapter of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and being able to live who you are.</v>

1096
00:51:33.351 --> 00:51:34.184
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten to feel that and now I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight with a peace of mind knowing how </v>

1097
00:51:38.751 --> 00:51:42.110
<v Speaker 2>good I am without fighting and how great</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am with it too.</v>

1098
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:45.800
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1099
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.220
<v Speaker 2>that's what this thing's about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these fights,</v>

1100
00:51:49.221 --> 00:51:50.054
<v Speaker 2>all these me attacking those challenges </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming back and winning and getting my </v>

1101
00:51:52.521 --> 00:51:54.040
<v Speaker 2>belt back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1102
00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.233
<v Speaker 2>that could only happen because I let go </v>
<v Speaker 2>of control of the things I couldn't </v>

1103
00:51:58.551 --> 00:52:01.280
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you come back,</v>

1104
00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:02.330
<v Speaker 2>you fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mitsui,</v>

1105
00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:03.163
<v Speaker 2>rocky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put on the performance of your </v>

1106
00:52:04.131 --> 00:52:05.330
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just destroyed him.</v>

1107
00:52:05.331 --> 00:52:07.280
<v Speaker 2>It was just a whirlwind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild,</v>

1108
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 2>crazy first round stoppage.</v>

1109
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1110
00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.493
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a big deal for me because he'd </v>

1111
00:52:17.271 --> 00:52:20.060
<v Speaker 2>never been stopped like that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot Jackie at this point,</v>

1112
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.670
<v Speaker 2>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was on a five fight win streak.</v>

1113
00:52:22.671 --> 00:52:26.600
<v Speaker 2>He hadn't lost since the whole time I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had been hurt and he was,</v>

1114
00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:27.613
<v Speaker 2>he was beating the top guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to beat him was going to tell me </v>

1115
00:52:30.351 --> 00:52:32.120
<v Speaker 2>you're good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go for the title.</v>

1116
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:33.470
<v Speaker 2>And I beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1117
00:52:33.471 --> 00:52:34.400
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here I am.</v>

1118
00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Let's go for that title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at this point,</v>

1119
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.133
<v Speaker 2>if you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Barao was the next coming to </v>

1120
00:52:41.181 --> 00:52:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Tj beat the brakes off of them.</v>

1121
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.850
<v Speaker 2>And now Tj is the next company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crises,</v>

1122
00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:48.230
<v Speaker 2>a better version of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's this,</v>

1123
00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:50.840
<v Speaker 2>he's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I said,</v>

1124
00:52:50.841 --> 00:52:51.591
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can be him.</v>

1125
00:52:51.591 --> 00:52:53.390
<v Speaker 2>I knew I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd been watching him on,</v>

1126
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.313
<v Speaker 2>on film and for Fox and breaking down </v>
<v Speaker 2>his fights and I knew I could beat </v>

1127
00:52:58.071 --> 00:52:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Barao.</v>

1128
00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:01.790
<v Speaker 2>I knew both those guys couldn't beat me </v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point,</v>

1129
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:03.103
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't matter what I thought I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to prove it and nobody's going to </v>

1130
00:53:07.131 --> 00:53:09.920
<v Speaker 2>believe you after for injuries the way I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had them.</v>

1131
00:53:09.921 --> 00:53:10.754
<v Speaker 2>So I just had to go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I blew my knee out training one month </v>

1132
00:53:15.381 --> 00:53:17.330
<v Speaker 2>after I fought to Chi Mizzou.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gawky.</v>

1133
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Now this is what's interesting about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story is I did research later.</v>

1134
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm now basically a doctor to figure all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff because all the injuries I've</v>

1135
00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:27.620
<v Speaker 2>been through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but three weeks before I fought ms dot,</v>

1136
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.780
<v Speaker 2>I had a staph infection in my right </v>
<v Speaker 2>thumb that popped up.</v>

1137
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:31.823
<v Speaker 2>So I took a um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotic called Cipro as I think it's </v>

1138
00:53:36.841 --> 00:53:41.841
<v Speaker 2>with the CIP pro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now me trusting the doctors and me not,</v>

1139
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.380
<v Speaker 2>it's my own fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not the doctor's fault.</v>

1140
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 2>I should have read what was the hazards </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the antibiotic,</v>

1141
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.680
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of trust the doctors and assume</v>

1142
00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.150
<v Speaker 2>why would he give me something bad?</v>

1143
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.983
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1144
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Cipro has an after effect for six months</v>
<v Speaker 2>after you ingest it that it weakens your</v>

1145
00:54:00.061 --> 00:54:03.960
<v Speaker 2>attendance so it makes them soft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like real puddy.</v>

1146
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:07.050
<v Speaker 2>And so I took it three weeks before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1147
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.650
<v Speaker 2>That made it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About two months after I ingested the,</v>

1148
00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:14.550
<v Speaker 2>the Cipro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was throwing a left high kick.</v>

1149
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.340
<v Speaker 2>I'd never had a problem with my right </v>
<v Speaker 2>knee,</v>

1150
00:54:17.341 --> 00:54:19.560
<v Speaker 2>my entire life ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just popped,</v>

1151
00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:20.394
<v Speaker 2>throwing a right high kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pivot on my right leg to throw the </v>

1152
00:54:22.921 --> 00:54:23.754
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went up high and it just popped and I </v>

1153
00:54:27.031 --> 00:54:28.830
<v Speaker 2>knew right away obviously because I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done two,</v>

1154
00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:29.693
<v Speaker 2>done it twice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I blew it out and I remember </v>

1155
00:54:31.561 --> 00:54:32.394
<v Speaker 2>literally blowing it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting on the floor of the guy that I </v>

1156
00:54:34.501 --> 00:54:35.790
<v Speaker 2>was driven with his like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>

1157
00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:36.570
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1158
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:37.830
<v Speaker 2>my knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just blew my knee out.</v>

1159
00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:38.880
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1160
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:39.713
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

1161
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was crazy.</v>

1162
00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.800
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1163
00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:44.693
<v Speaker 2>It was a weird feeling and what was even</v>
<v Speaker 2>weirder was the piece I had sitting </v>

1164
00:54:50.191 --> 00:54:51.870
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even carry.</v>

1165
00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:56.130
<v Speaker 2>I literally was just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember blowing it out and sitting on</v>

1166
00:54:56.131 --> 00:54:59.040
<v Speaker 2>the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I told her,</v>

1167
00:54:59.070 --> 00:54:59.641
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric,</v>

1168
00:54:59.641 --> 00:55:00.474
<v Speaker 2>come here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I told him to come over and I was </v>

1169
00:55:01.051 --> 00:55:03.060
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ready for another nine months?</v>

1170
00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:05.610
<v Speaker 2>ACL reconstructive surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1171
00:55:05.611 --> 00:55:06.391
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1172
00:55:06.391 --> 00:55:07.840
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your needs fine,</v>

1173
00:55:07.841 --> 00:55:08.451
<v Speaker 2>you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1174
00:55:08.451 --> 00:55:09.031
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's blew.</v>

1175
00:55:09.031 --> 00:55:10.200
<v Speaker 2>I blew it out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1176
00:55:10.201 --> 00:55:10.711
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't.</v>

1177
00:55:10.711 --> 00:55:11.101
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1178
00:55:11.101 --> 00:55:13.290
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was it.</v>

1179
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:16.140
<v Speaker 2>And so I start again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Start again.</v>

1180
00:55:16.141 --> 00:55:16.974
<v Speaker 2>So I started the Rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same style of a reconstruction this </v>

1181
00:55:20.071 --> 00:55:20.904
<v Speaker 2>times better because I had the first two</v>
<v Speaker 2>practice tries and now I had the secret </v>

1182
00:55:26.971 --> 00:55:27.240
<v Speaker 2>link.</v>

1183
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.910
<v Speaker 2>What's the secret link that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know for the first three injuries that I</v>

1184
00:55:29.911 --> 00:55:34.230
<v Speaker 2>had was letting go of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was the,</v>

1185
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:35.093
<v Speaker 2>this was my diamond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was to now I had a way to prove </v>

1186
00:55:37.981 --> 00:55:38.814
<v Speaker 2>that I was onto something in my own mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did it and I was onto something </v>

1187
00:55:43.471 --> 00:55:46.260
<v Speaker 2>and I know it now and nobody can ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me anything different.</v>

1188
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.600
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just.</v>

1189
00:55:48.601 --> 00:55:50.970
<v Speaker 2>I stopped right then and there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The day I blew my knee out.</v>

1190
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I didn't train again for nine months </v>
<v Speaker 2>other than physical therapy.</v>

1191
00:55:55.081 --> 00:55:57.300
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't shadow box,</v>

1192
00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.610
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do a pushup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do a setup.</v>

1193
00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:01.990
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do a squat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

1194
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:02.903
<v Speaker 2>I went in the gym occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because I had learned to let go of </v>

1195
00:56:06.361 --> 00:56:10.440
<v Speaker 2>fighting from the first two injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go in there panicking,</v>

1196
00:56:10.441 --> 00:56:13.290
<v Speaker 2>trying to keep training because I needed</v>
<v Speaker 2>it for my health anymore.</v>

1197
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:14.543
<v Speaker 2>I already learned that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the way I find health is to not </v>

1198
00:56:17.881 --> 00:56:19.890
<v Speaker 2>train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let my body completely healed,</v>

1199
00:56:19.891 --> 00:56:20.724
<v Speaker 2>don't do anything and focus on my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I spent another nine months focusing </v>

1200
00:56:25.781 --> 00:56:28.630
<v Speaker 2>on nothing but my mind and my tactic </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1201
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.823
<v Speaker 2>your body's not working right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got to switch it over to the </v>

1202
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:32.770
<v Speaker 2>next weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you have,</v>

1203
00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:33.880
<v Speaker 2>which is your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your will,</v>

1204
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:37.270
<v Speaker 2>your mind is the only other weapon you </v>
<v Speaker 2>use besides your body on fight night.</v>

1205
00:56:37.271 --> 00:56:38.980
<v Speaker 2>So if your body's not working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>switch it over.</v>

1206
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:42.370
<v Speaker 2>So I just focused on my mind and by </v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing on my mind,</v>

1207
00:56:42.371 --> 00:56:43.204
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started looking up guys like Wayne </v>

1208
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:46.263
<v Speaker 2>Dyer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1209
00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:49.500
<v Speaker 2>I started talking to a guy named Mike </v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jordan,</v>

1210
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Michael t larden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Mark Michael,</v>

1211
00:56:52.001 --> 00:56:55.510
<v Speaker 2>t dot larden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started putting in place specific,</v>

1212
00:56:55.590 --> 00:56:57.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to people for my,</v>

1213
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Speaker 2>for my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1214
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 2>to talk to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked up to a power people,</v>

1215
00:57:02.111 --> 00:57:03.070
<v Speaker 2>I guess you'd put them right.</v>

1216
00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have some too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I focused on nothing but my mind,</v>

1217
00:57:07.001 --> 00:57:09.840
<v Speaker 2>I didn't train at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1218
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.630
<v Speaker 2>I remember I got a call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was out at the lake in Arizona.</v>

1219
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:18.070
<v Speaker 2>I literally hit the nine month mark on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this weekend.</v>

1220
00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I get a call from shelby to nine month </v>
<v Speaker 2>mark.</v>

1221
00:57:21.851 --> 00:57:25.120
<v Speaker 2>They knew my knee was going to be old </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>

1222
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:27.063
<v Speaker 2>you're healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1223
00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:27.701
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1224
00:57:27.701 --> 00:57:29.830
<v Speaker 2>I've done nothing but rehab it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been nine months.</v>

1225
00:57:29.831 --> 00:57:31.960
<v Speaker 2>So technically I'm cleared by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>

1226
00:57:31.961 --> 00:57:32.794
<v Speaker 2>they know I'm cleared by the doctor </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the UFC talks with the doctors </v>

1227
00:57:35.261 --> 00:57:37.210
<v Speaker 2>24 slash seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they admit it or not.</v>

1228
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:38.343
<v Speaker 2>So it's like even if the doctor </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't tell the UFC there telling </v>

1229
00:57:40.511 --> 00:57:41.344
<v Speaker 2>them everything so they know exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm at in Rehab exactly where I'm </v>

1230
00:57:44.351 --> 00:57:45.184
<v Speaker 2>at in therapy to the tee and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 2>they know when to call me and put the </v>

1231
00:57:48.401 --> 00:57:49.234
<v Speaker 2>heat on me.</v>

1232
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.640
<v Speaker 2>So I'm out on the boat drinking some </v>
<v Speaker 2>beers,</v>

1233
00:57:51.641 --> 00:57:55.990
<v Speaker 2>trying to enjoy my life and I get a call</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can get you.</v>

1234
00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:56.853
<v Speaker 2>We want to give you a title fight with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tj dillashaw in the beginning of the </v>

1235
00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:00.923
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1236
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:05.290
<v Speaker 2>At that point I had 12 weeks when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>called me to get ready for the fight.</v>

1237
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.500
<v Speaker 2>So three months but zero training for </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine months.</v>

1238
00:58:08.501 --> 00:58:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Just to be able to get yourself into </v>

1241
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:15.310
<v Speaker 2>five round performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct?</v>

1242
00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

1243
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:18.873
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1244
00:58:19.601 --> 00:58:20.434
<v Speaker 2>haven't told anybody because I don't sit</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and talk for two hours to anybody </v>

1245
00:58:26.561 --> 00:58:28.180
<v Speaker 2>about this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Pretty much you're the only guy who gets</v>

1248
00:58:32.831 --> 00:58:33.640
<v Speaker 2>into this weird stuff.</v>

1249
00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:38.640
<v Speaker 2>So here we are and all it comes down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like,</v>

1250
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on zero.</v>

1251
00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:42.483
<v Speaker 2>And I said again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of what I learned with the MS </v>

1252
00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:46.420
<v Speaker 2>dot docket thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>letting go.</v>

1253
00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:51.400
<v Speaker 2>I just kept exercising that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's gonna happen is gonna happen.</v>

1254
00:58:51.401 --> 00:58:53.560
<v Speaker 2>It's out of my control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God's God has planned for me.</v>

1255
00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:56.890
<v Speaker 2>He took me this far in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my higher power.</v>

1256
00:58:57.070 --> 00:58:57.903
<v Speaker 2>And remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're listening and your higher </v>

1257
00:58:59.591 --> 00:59:01.930
<v Speaker 2>power is not God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be whatever you want it to be for</v>

1258
00:59:01.931 --> 00:59:02.764
<v Speaker 2>your higher power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that matter of just letting a </v>

1259
00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:07.660
<v Speaker 2>matter of just letting go and </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding that there's,</v>

1260
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:12.800
<v Speaker 2>there's something in effect that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger than you hear in the universe and</v>

1261
00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:14.283
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be who you're going to </v>

1262
00:59:16.421 --> 00:59:17.680
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you,</v>

1263
00:59:17.681 --> 00:59:20.500
<v Speaker 2>when you are who you are because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not worried about all these other things</v>

1264
00:59:20.501 --> 00:59:22.340
<v Speaker 2>connected to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get your,</v>

1265
00:59:22.341 --> 00:59:23.450
<v Speaker 2>your fullest self.</v>

1266
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:25.003
<v Speaker 2>And in being that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it allowed me to get ready for Tj </v>

1267
00:59:27.051 --> 00:59:30.470
<v Speaker 2>because I wasn't thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been fighting.</v>

1268
00:59:30.471 --> 00:59:32.150
<v Speaker 2>You haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been this,</v>

1269
00:59:32.151 --> 00:59:35.690
<v Speaker 2>you haven't that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of that mattered.</v>

1270
00:59:35.691 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't relevant because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting him no matter what.</v>

1271
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.863
<v Speaker 2>So I just let go and said getting a tip </v>
<v Speaker 2>top shape you can with the tools you </v>

1272
00:59:42.471 --> 00:59:44.330
<v Speaker 2>have and let's go fight him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1273
00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:45.440
<v Speaker 2>you have the skillset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1274
00:59:45.441 --> 00:59:46.274
<v Speaker 2>you have the knowledge and the movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're young enough and your body's </v>

1275
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:48.703
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just proved that with ms dot </v>

1276
00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.133
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just got to get in shape and </v>

1277
00:59:51.891 --> 00:59:54.170
<v Speaker 2>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was literally my mindset.</v>

1278
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1279
00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:02.060
<v Speaker 2>at that eight week mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it saw at 12 weeks I start training.</v>

1280
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:05.390
<v Speaker 2>So that's 12 weeks out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 weeks out I start,</v>

1281
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:06.643
<v Speaker 2>I stopped just physical therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I was doing three times a week </v>

1282
01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:13.550
<v Speaker 2>only and I go to flight training.</v>

1283
01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.930
<v Speaker 2>I start my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1284
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:18.410
<v Speaker 2>just my regimen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do for each camp in doing that,</v>

1285
01:00:18.411 --> 01:00:21.830
<v Speaker 2>going from off the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing nothing straight into a five round</v>

1286
01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:23.650
<v Speaker 2>title fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1287
01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I learned that actually sparked what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had now have,</v>

1288
01:00:27.471 --> 01:00:29.750
<v Speaker 2>which is plantar Fascia tendonitis in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1289
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:30.584
<v Speaker 2>both my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's because going from resting </v>

1290
01:00:33.051 --> 01:00:34.100
<v Speaker 2>for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1291
01:00:34.101 --> 01:00:36.680
<v Speaker 2>three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then going full bore on your feet,</v>

1292
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:37.783
<v Speaker 2>it tore all the Fascia on the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my feet because they weren't ready for </v>

1293
01:00:39.831 --> 01:00:40.664
<v Speaker 2>the brunt of forest that I was putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>on him when my footwork and my movement </v>

1294
01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:46.460
<v Speaker 2>and my sparring and my kickboxing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

1295
01:00:46.461 --> 01:00:47.294
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I tore all the Fascia on the bottom </v>

1296
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:49.124
<v Speaker 2>of my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started feeling something weird on </v>

1297
01:00:50.661 --> 01:00:54.320
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of my left foot in that camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously at the,</v>

1298
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:57.590
<v Speaker 2>at the eight week mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after I had been training for 12,</v>

1299
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:58.723
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1300
01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Four weeks I've been training for the TJ</v>
<v Speaker 2>dillashaw camp.</v>

1301
01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.150
<v Speaker 2>I broke my rib so I get kicked in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>rib.</v>

1302
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:06.103
<v Speaker 2>My Body's just soft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't been getting kicked or punched </v>

1303
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:14.450
<v Speaker 2>in over for three and a half years now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you think about it,</v>

1304
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:18.800
<v Speaker 2>ms dot occupied doesn't even count so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast and he didn't even hit you.</v>

1305
01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:22.580
<v Speaker 2>He didn't hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hit me one time and it was just under</v>

1306
01:01:22.581 --> 01:01:23.414
<v Speaker 2>a minute long fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the only wear and tear and and </v>

1307
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:28.543
<v Speaker 2>Callus for lack of a better term I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>on my body is from the training camp </v>

1308
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.230
<v Speaker 2>before Ms With Aki,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was only a three round camp.</v>

1309
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:39.620
<v Speaker 2>So I have no wear and tear on my body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no toughness.</v>

1310
01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:42.350
<v Speaker 2>He kicked my rib,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks my rib,</v>

1311
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:43.543
<v Speaker 2>I lose right then and there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wrestle anymore and I can't </v>

1312
01:01:46.401 --> 01:01:47.234
<v Speaker 2>speak anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm at eight weeks out of the </v>

1313
01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:49.304
<v Speaker 2>flight and they take away my sparring </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they take away my wrestling because </v>

1314
01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:52.514
<v Speaker 2>I can't go live.</v>

1315
01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:53.443
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just drilling kickboxing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pad work with coach Eric dolphy around </v>

1316
01:01:57.211 --> 01:02:02.211
<v Speaker 2>Miguel Ras and grappling a drills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you taping up your rib now?</v>

1317
01:02:03.521 --> 01:02:06.920
<v Speaker 2>I get this big a thing that goes over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top.</v>

1318
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:09.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like this weird protector and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wear that.</v>

1319
01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Is it a protector against impact or </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect our.</v>

1320
01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Does it actually like a cast that holds </v>
<v Speaker 2>your ribs in place or.</v>

1321
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:16.483
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like I had to look it up online </v>

1322
01:02:18.231 --> 01:02:20.940
<v Speaker 2>myself or some makeshift thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would work in this thing.</v>

1323
01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Work the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it's called.</v>

1324
01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:26.010
<v Speaker 2>I can text it to you and figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like a picture,</v>

1325
01:02:26.011 --> 01:02:27.720
<v Speaker 2>like what you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>

1326
01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:30.280
<v Speaker 2>what the coaches were when they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>that body plane.</v>

1327
01:02:30.281 --> 01:02:32.550
<v Speaker 2>He can punch in the body and it goes all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way up to here.</v>

1328
01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I'm talking about?</v>

1329
01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:37.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of those but it's a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller and it just goes here.</v>

1330
01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:38.880
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1331
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.240
<v Speaker 2>you put it on like a shirt and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>crosses and the cables,</v>

1332
01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.220
<v Speaker 2>crocs crossing the back and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole front is kind like,</v>

1333
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.073
<v Speaker 2>squishy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but protecting you from squeezing and </v>

1334
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:52.400
<v Speaker 2>blunt force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I wasn't taking any anyways.</v>

1335
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:54.360
<v Speaker 2>I was just wearing that for when I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>drill.</v>

1336
01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.960
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't gone live yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I finally start panicking when I</v>

1337
01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:04.560
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't spar or wrestle alive after four</v>

1338
01:03:04.561 --> 01:03:06.030
<v Speaker 2>weeks with a busted rib,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1339
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:06.811
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll go away.</v>

1340
01:03:06.811 --> 01:03:09.420
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't going away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just killing me.</v>

1341
01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:11.170
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1342
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:12.870
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't sneeze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't cough.</v>

1343
01:03:12.871 --> 01:03:13.704
<v Speaker 2>It was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just said I got to shoot a </v>

1344
01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.200
<v Speaker 2>cortisone and see if that helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go in,</v>

1345
01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:21.210
<v Speaker 2>see the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shoot a cortisone.</v>

1346
01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Thank God it worked and numbed it within</v>
<v Speaker 2>three days a moving again,</v>

1347
01:03:25.891 --> 01:03:26.724
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the reason I didn't shoot it right </v>

1348
01:03:28.381 --> 01:03:29.214
<v Speaker 2>away is because you want to give it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much time as you can to heal before you </v>

1349
01:03:31.321 --> 01:03:32.154
<v Speaker 2>shoot it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see if you can minimize the damage </v>

1350
01:03:33.721 --> 01:03:36.060
<v Speaker 2>that you do with the cortisone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that makes sense.</v>

1351
01:03:36.061 --> 01:03:38.230
<v Speaker 2>That's why I didn't do it right on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does damage it.</v>

1352
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:41.850
<v Speaker 2>It breaks down tissue like muscle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tendon tissue.</v>

1353
01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.820
<v Speaker 2>If you overdo it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do within three and one injected</v>

1354
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.620
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to do more than three</v>

1355
01:03:47.621 --> 01:03:48.990
<v Speaker 2>in one area depending on where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>

1356
01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:49.824
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my first one in this particular </v>

1357
01:03:51.211 --> 01:03:52.740
<v Speaker 2>rib.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've had them all over my body,</v>

1358
01:03:52.741 --> 01:03:53.810
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this rip,</v>

1359
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.030
<v Speaker 2>when that kicks in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1360
01:03:57.031 --> 01:03:58.830
<v Speaker 2>sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can spar and I can wrestle now.</v>

1361
01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:01.140
<v Speaker 2>I just got to wear that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole camp,</v>

1362
01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:05.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm wearing this thing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do any core workout.</v>

1363
01:04:05.671 --> 01:04:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I can't do any strength and conditioning</v>
<v Speaker 2>at all because we had to ditch those two</v>

1364
01:04:10.531 --> 01:04:11.364
<v Speaker 2>things in order to focus on cardio and </v>
<v Speaker 2>skill because we had to get my cardio </v>

1365
01:04:14.761 --> 01:04:15.594
<v Speaker 2>and skill back in my timing and my reads</v>
<v Speaker 2>back more than I needed strength and </v>

1366
01:04:19.441 --> 01:04:22.950
<v Speaker 2>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because I'm coming back from so much,</v>

1367
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:23.813
<v Speaker 2>you actually have to just cut out what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not needed in the cans that you've had </v>

1368
01:04:26.671 --> 01:04:27.504
<v Speaker 2>in the past and take what you can use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are you doing for cardios own </v>

1369
01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.053
<v Speaker 2>makeshift?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a sprint routine that I run that </v>

1370
01:04:33.991 --> 01:04:37.400
<v Speaker 2>solely mine that I got from a guy named </v>
<v Speaker 2>drew fickett way back in the day.</v>

1371
01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:38.310
<v Speaker 2>I know drew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1372
01:04:38.311 --> 01:04:39.930
<v Speaker 2>you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As my first MMA coach.</v>

1373
01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a nasty,</v>

1374
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.860
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dirty,</v>

1375
01:04:43.861 --> 01:04:44.694
<v Speaker 2>filthy son of a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just leave it at that Heaven Don </v>

1376
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Frye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started out with two of them,</v>

1377
01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:51.923
<v Speaker 2>first MMA coach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to give you an idea of when I </v>

1378
01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.000
<v Speaker 2>started and they weren't even my coaches</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you know them,</v>

1379
01:04:57.001 --> 01:04:57.834
<v Speaker 2>they don't coach anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just yell at you slurs and then </v>

1380
01:05:00.061 --> 01:05:00.894
<v Speaker 2>maybe put you to sleep a couple of times</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Don Frye throws head kicks when </v>

1381
01:05:03.571 --> 01:05:07.470
<v Speaker 2>you're only supposed to be boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like they're not real coaches,</v>

1382
01:05:07.471 --> 01:05:09.270
<v Speaker 2>they're just showing you how to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>maniac.</v>

1383
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:12.120
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he shows me this sprint routine,</v>

1384
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:15.440
<v Speaker 2>which I still use to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So true.</v>

1385
01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:16.283
<v Speaker 2>Fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the man.</v>

1386
01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm so and but you're still dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>plantar fasciitis now.</v>

1387
01:05:20.171 --> 01:05:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Well then it starts kicking in because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the sprinting,</v>

1388
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:24.070
<v Speaker 2>sprinting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>footwork,</v>

1389
01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>everything else coming from nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's only in my left foot,</v>

1390
01:05:27.821 --> 01:05:29.380
<v Speaker 2>so I think I kicked an elbow.</v>

1391
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno a habit yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't go get an Mri.</v>

1392
01:05:33.641 --> 01:05:34.474
<v Speaker 2>I don't check anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just ignore it because I'm fighting </v>

1393
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:37.450
<v Speaker 2>either way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to know.</v>

1394
01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's just better not knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1395
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.470
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're gonna fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's hard or not.</v>

1396
01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:42.693
<v Speaker 2>So I just said screw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't shoot it up with cortisone or </v>

1397
01:05:45.761 --> 01:05:47.610
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just ignored it.</v>

1398
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Kept running super painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've ever had it.</v>

1399
01:05:49.871 --> 01:05:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Plantar Fasciitis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's debilitating to an extent.</v>

1400
01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:54.190
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1401
01:05:54.191 --> 01:05:59.191
<v Speaker 2>thank God it was only in one foot and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I go into that fight with about.</v>

1402
01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 2>I had about a good solid four week camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>of sparring in wrestling thing,</v>

1403
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:05.860
<v Speaker 2>god of live stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other than that,</v>

1404
01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:09.640
<v Speaker 2>the first 12 weeks was basically just </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting into shape.</v>

1405
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.380
<v Speaker 2>So my whole camp was comprised of mostly</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprints,</v>

1406
01:06:14.381 --> 01:06:19.150
<v Speaker 2>pad work in about a month of sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I lost almost all rounds coming back</v>

1407
01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:24.100
<v Speaker 2>because I was just so off from the year </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the not doing anything in my body,</v>

1408
01:06:24.101 --> 01:06:26.980
<v Speaker 2>not being strong and trying to get back </v>
<v Speaker 2>in shape.</v>

1409
01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:27.843
<v Speaker 2>And it was tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was by far that camp was the worst </v>

1410
01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:36.430
<v Speaker 2>put together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most off in horrible camp.</v>

1411
01:06:36.431 --> 01:06:40.700
<v Speaker 2>I've had in my whole 24 fights by far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won the title and I.</v>

1412
01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some thing.</v>

1413
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.770
<v Speaker 2>The good Lord above.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won that title that that's how I,</v>

1414
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.710
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it didn't really make sense.</v>

1415
01:06:47.711 --> 01:06:50.950
<v Speaker 2>But it happened and we didn't know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you had plantar fasciitis.</v>

1416
01:06:50.951 --> 01:06:54.430
<v Speaker 2>So when you kept getting hit by leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks and your leg was giving out,</v>

1417
01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:57.520
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking that your leg was giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>out from the impact.</v>

1418
01:06:57.521 --> 01:06:58.780
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't take,</v>

1419
01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:00.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard as a.</v>

1420
01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:04.360
<v Speaker 2>especially I do it with you color now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard,</v>

1421
01:07:04.361 --> 01:07:05.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing's hard.</v>

1422
01:07:05.651 --> 01:07:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Somebody's going to get mad no matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do,</v>

1423
01:07:07.301 --> 01:07:09.880
<v Speaker 2>no matter what you say eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1424
01:07:09.881 --> 01:07:10.714
<v Speaker 2>how are you supposed to know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Foot's blown out before I get in </v>

1425
01:07:12.581 --> 01:07:12.760
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1426
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I saw you in the,</v>

1427
01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:16.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uriah faber fight,</v>

1428
01:07:16.361 --> 01:07:17.194
<v Speaker 2>which happened after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I noticed your foot was taped </v>

1429
01:07:18.461 --> 01:07:19.294
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both.</v>

1430
01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went into the other foot as well.</v>

1431
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:26.800
<v Speaker 2>And then the cody fight it multiplied by</v>
<v Speaker 2>two in both feet.</v>

1432
01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:29.530
<v Speaker 2>So instead of just having it in one for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tj,</v>

1433
01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.780
<v Speaker 2>I get through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I have it in both.</v>

1434
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:35.110
<v Speaker 2>It just started my other foot for favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then by the,</v>

1435
01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:36.910
<v Speaker 2>by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the cody fight,</v>

1436
01:07:36.911 --> 01:07:39.100
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been out of control.</v>

1437
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:41.320
<v Speaker 2>I had done a three camps and I had done </v>
<v Speaker 2>a year,</v>

1438
01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:45.340
<v Speaker 2>a year of nonstop work after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after that year off.</v>

1439
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:46.810
<v Speaker 2>And what can you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No excuses.</v>

1440
01:07:46.811 --> 01:07:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I want to go ahead and make this this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point right now.</v>

1441
01:07:48.791 --> 01:07:50.380
<v Speaker 2>There's no excuses for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1442
01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:55.740
<v Speaker 2>I did pretty good at wrapping it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shot botox in the bottom of both of my</v>

1443
01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:56.320
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>

1444
01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.153
<v Speaker 2>Botox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the worst thing I've ever gone </v>

1445
01:07:58.691 --> 01:08:00.130
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does Botox,</v>

1446
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:02.770
<v Speaker 2>what does that do for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea with botox as it was a,</v>

1447
01:08:02.771 --> 01:08:03.604
<v Speaker 2>it was an off the wall method because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no cure for plantar fascia </v>

1448
01:08:06.641 --> 01:08:08.590
<v Speaker 2>tendons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just improvise this?</v>

1449
01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was,</v>

1450
01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:11.290
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard it from other doctors.</v>

1451
01:08:11.291 --> 01:08:12.124
<v Speaker 2>It's an underground method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I was just willing to do </v>

1452
01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:15.410
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1453
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:16.730
<v Speaker 2>like I was in so much pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1454
01:08:16.731 --> 01:08:17.564
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd wake up in the morning and I'd have </v>

1455
01:08:19.641 --> 01:08:20.474
<v Speaker 2>to go on my hands and knees to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathtub so I wouldn't put weight on my </v>

1456
01:08:23.241 --> 01:08:24.074
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>

1457
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:26.300
<v Speaker 2>So I wouldn't put up during fight camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1458
01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:29.660
<v Speaker 2>So I wouldn't put weight on my feet </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're are too cold,</v>

1459
01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:31.550
<v Speaker 2>so it's like needles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1460
01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.800
<v Speaker 2>so you have to warm them up first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1461
01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:35.960
<v Speaker 2>So that the fasciitis doesn't get worse.</v>

1462
01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:41.260
<v Speaker 2>So I fill up a tub with hot water and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Epson salt and then I,</v>

1463
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:44.303
<v Speaker 2>I filled that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to fill that out by going on my </v>

1464
01:08:46.071 --> 01:08:47.870
<v Speaker 2>hands and knees because you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to put weight on it early.</v>

1465
01:08:47.871 --> 01:08:51.770
<v Speaker 2>This is a method I heard from a runner </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he used in order to heal his.</v>

1466
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:55.190
<v Speaker 2>And so I tried it for about a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going,</v>

1467
01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:57.830
<v Speaker 2>I would fill it up and then I soak my </v>
<v Speaker 2>feet every morning.</v>

1468
01:08:57.831 --> 01:08:58.664
<v Speaker 2>Then after I sold them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a tape routine that I have on </v>

1469
01:09:00.591 --> 01:09:02.060
<v Speaker 2>both my feet at tape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both my feet,</v>

1470
01:09:02.061 --> 01:09:02.894
<v Speaker 2>like you would picture taping your hands</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I wear my shoes and I warm up </v>

1471
01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:11.060
<v Speaker 2>my feet before I get there at the gym </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'd go,</v>

1472
01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:14.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was for all three of the fights</v>

1473
01:09:14.631 --> 01:09:15.464
<v Speaker 2>this last year I've had to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and I actually did a really good </v>

1474
01:09:18.231 --> 01:09:19.064
<v Speaker 2>job minimizing the pain and the botox </v>
<v Speaker 2>first I shot cortisone in them and that </v>

1475
01:09:22.941 --> 01:09:25.070
<v Speaker 2>didn't help and numbed it a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't help.</v>

1476
01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.400
<v Speaker 2>I shot it after when I fought Tj and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was getting kicked in the leg,</v>

1477
01:09:28.401 --> 01:09:29.320
<v Speaker 2>like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was,</v>

1478
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.883
<v Speaker 2>that was my foot being toward like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascia actually completely tore off the </v>

1479
01:09:33.021 --> 01:09:36.110
<v Speaker 2>heel in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That hurt that I felt.</v>

1480
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:39.950
<v Speaker 2>I've never felt anything really in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight that I felt when it popped.</v>

1481
01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:41.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I knew I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1482
01:09:41.811 --> 01:09:42.644
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my foot's tour and a half or </v>

1483
01:09:43.521 --> 01:09:45.920
<v Speaker 2>something because it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt it when it,</v>

1484
01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:46.873
<v Speaker 2>when it popped open in that fifth round </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had about four minutes left </v>

1485
01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.260
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember like,</v>

1486
01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better,</v>

1487
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:54.980
<v Speaker 2>you better figure something out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1488
01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:56.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could tell I was staying a little </v>

1489
01:09:56.661 --> 01:09:59.320
<v Speaker 2>bit more stationary I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why the kickstart to land.</v>

1490
01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:01.900
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it goes,</v>

1491
01:10:01.901 --> 01:10:02.990
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in the fight business.</v>

1492
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:05.900
<v Speaker 2>All of us go in there with injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making excuses,</v>

1493
01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:07.430
<v Speaker 2>but people want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1494
01:10:07.431 --> 01:10:09.070
<v Speaker 2>injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all go in there in jail.</v>

1495
01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like almost all of us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1496
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:16.720
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of high level like marathon </v>
<v Speaker 2>runners deal with this foot problem that</v>

1497
01:10:16.761 --> 01:10:19.820
<v Speaker 2>I have and they run marathons with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>so it can be done.</v>

1498
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:22.610
<v Speaker 2>But it's just an extra hindrance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult.</v>

1499
01:10:22.611 --> 01:10:25.640
<v Speaker 2>And going barefoot with it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the hardest part.</v>

1500
01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:27.021
<v Speaker 2>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1501
01:10:27.021 --> 01:10:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Because at least marathon runners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some wear shoe.</v>

1502
01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:31.370
<v Speaker 2>And that helps because I have orthotics </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>

1503
01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Supports you can put that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the support,</v>

1504
01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:37.820
<v Speaker 2>but I have a high arch and so what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>means is the arch,</v>

1505
01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:38.893
<v Speaker 2>there's a Fascia that hold everything in</v>
<v Speaker 2>place and the art starts to fail and </v>

1506
01:10:41.151 --> 01:10:41.984
<v Speaker 2>that's what that needle feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's the Fascia on the bottom </v>

1507
01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:47.390
<v Speaker 2>of your foot because I'm always on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>toes.</v>

1508
01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.553
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't ready for the brunt from zero </v>

1509
01:10:50.511 --> 01:10:53.510
<v Speaker 2>to hero run and it kind of put a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of lesions in it.</v>

1510
01:10:53.511 --> 01:10:55.160
<v Speaker 2>And now how do you heal those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>

1511
01:10:55.161 --> 01:10:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Can you tape it with an orthotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath?</v>

1512
01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.053
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I mean then you have orthotics </v>

1513
01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:02.060
<v Speaker 2>tucked to the bottom of your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're hopping around.</v>

1514
01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.400
<v Speaker 2>You basically just training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I just take my.</v>

1515
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wear my wrestling shoes and I taped my</v>

1516
01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:07.094
<v Speaker 2>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taped my feet and were wrestling shoes </v>

1517
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:09.980
<v Speaker 2>with my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my,</v>

1518
01:11:09.981 --> 01:11:10.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supports in there.</v>

1519
01:11:10.911 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what methods of healing</v>

1520
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:17.610
<v Speaker 1>can they sort of use?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't any.</v>

1521
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Now this is why I use both stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1522
01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:25.430
<v Speaker 1>I was actually thinking of getting some </v>
<v Speaker 1>stem cells put in my elbows,</v>

1523
01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:29.220
<v Speaker 1>my shoulders and my knees coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for my feet,</v>

1524
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:32.670
<v Speaker 1>prp and stem cell is all just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all just.</v>

1525
01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it doesn't.</v>

1526
01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Anything you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you google plan to.</v>

1527
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:40.080
<v Speaker 1>They have no cure for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1528
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:42.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a worldwide problem that there's no</v>

1529
01:11:42.691 --> 01:11:43.524
<v Speaker 1>cure for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where are you going to get the stem </v>

1530
01:11:44.881 --> 01:11:46.560
<v Speaker 1>cell stuff done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1531
01:11:46.561 --> 01:11:48.210
<v Speaker 1>well I've only talked to people about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1532
01:11:48.211 --> 01:11:50.720
<v Speaker 1>but I'd be more than happy to care with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you on.</v>

1533
01:11:50.721 --> 01:11:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he has some hookups because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>need the best in the world out.</v>

1534
01:11:53.290 --> 01:11:55.950
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Rodney Mcgee.</v>

1535
01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.760
<v Speaker 1>He's heard of a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's worked with a lot.</v>

1536
01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Daniel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's worked with people before Cormier,</v>

1537
01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy does he.</v>

1538
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:04.583
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of different ways to do </v>

1539
01:12:05.011 --> 01:12:05.844
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] guy went into his hip and </v>

1540
01:12:07.111 --> 01:12:09.620
<v Speaker 1>they pulled a bone marrow out of his hip</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

1541
01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:13.620
<v Speaker 1>it's super painful and then they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own stem cells from that.</v>

1542
01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.640
<v Speaker 1>The way the guy in Vegas does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're taking the stem cells.</v>

1543
01:12:17.641 --> 01:12:18.474
<v Speaker 1>When a woman has a Cesarean section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she gives birth through Sicilian </v>

1544
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:22.980
<v Speaker 1>section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take away the placenta.</v>

1545
01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:23.993
<v Speaker 1>They usually would just throw it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can take that placenta and </v>

1546
01:12:25.921 --> 01:12:26.754
<v Speaker 1>extract stem cells from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have that than some of the </v>

1547
01:12:28.621 --> 01:12:29.454
<v Speaker 1>dcs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want them digging in your </v>

1548
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:34.550
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super painful on your hip too.</v>

1549
01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:35.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about how he was limping </v>

1550
01:12:36.451 --> 01:12:38.270
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's big boned though.</v>

1551
01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a big fellow,</v>

1552
01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.750
<v Speaker 1>but he sees this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

1553
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

1554
01:12:44.051 --> 01:12:44.884
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody said to me once a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she should be fight in middleweight and </v>

1555
01:12:46.890 --> 01:12:49.110
<v Speaker 1>go stand next to them and say that his.</v>

1556
01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.130
<v Speaker 1>He's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1557
01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:53.300
<v Speaker 1>he's a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a big dude.</v>

1558
01:12:53.301 --> 01:12:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might only be five,</v>

1559
01:12:54.361 --> 01:12:55.194
<v Speaker 1>10 Chubby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's stronger than anybody can </v>

1560
01:12:59.251 --> 01:13:01.410
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't pick up Dan Henderson.</v>

1561
01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:02.244
<v Speaker 1>How about Josh Barnett?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when he was fighting a </v>

1562
01:13:04.041 --> 01:13:04.874
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight and strikeforce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He picked up Josh Barnett like it was a </v>

1563
01:13:06.991 --> 01:13:07.824
<v Speaker 1>pillow and slammed them on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like the guy like blows my mind </v>

1564
01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:16.710
<v Speaker 1>how good he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenal wrestling enough credit.</v>

1565
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.053
<v Speaker 1>I know DC on a training level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I watch him train on a personal </v>

1566
01:13:20.701 --> 01:13:21.660
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1567
01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:24.930
<v Speaker 1>he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always talking out of his butt,</v>

1568
01:13:24.931 --> 01:13:25.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to an extent.</v>

1569
01:13:25.891 --> 01:13:27.990
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1570
01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.960
<v Speaker 1>he's a beast man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to respect that.</v>

1571
01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love that guy.</v>

1572
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:33.690
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a great guy.</v>

1573
01:13:33.691 --> 01:13:36.750
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in the era of John Jones,</v>

1574
01:13:37.050 --> 01:13:37.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he lost to John and his first fight </v>

1575
01:13:39.241 --> 01:13:41.190
<v Speaker 1>and he was also dealing with the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that John,</v>

1576
01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:43.710
<v Speaker 1>although I love John to John's a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1577
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:44.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he's got to sort of be there </v>

1578
01:13:46.201 --> 01:13:49.530
<v Speaker 1>while John keeps fucking up and then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of it comes back to him,</v>

1579
01:13:49.650 --> 01:13:50.483
<v Speaker 1>but that's where I look at DC and why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to give them all the respect in the </v>

1580
01:13:53.251 --> 01:13:57.960
<v Speaker 1>world I can because I don't feel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people give enough respect to dc for the</v>

1581
01:13:57.961 --> 01:14:00.570
<v Speaker 1>fact that he's not fucking know he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great outcome.</v>

1582
01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:01.403
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1583
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:03.390
<v Speaker 1>How does that get overlooked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1584
01:14:03.391 --> 01:14:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can connect fuckups yeah,</v>

1585
01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.390
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>

1586
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:10.230
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1587
01:14:10.231 --> 01:14:14.590
<v Speaker 1>and John Jones is that good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing is literally that</v>

1588
01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:15.730
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's that good.</v>

1589
01:14:15.731 --> 01:14:17.920
<v Speaker 1>He can beat you after you did coke three</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago.</v>

1590
01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about John,</v>

1591
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm good enough to win after three </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgeries,</v>

1592
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:25.240
<v Speaker 1>so let's see what we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can test the waters on Bob.</v>

1593
01:14:25.241 --> 01:14:26.074
<v Speaker 1>Let's see who does what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do a line of coke next time and to </v>

1594
01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:29.830
<v Speaker 1>try to jump in there and see how I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1595
01:14:29.831 --> 01:14:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's blow his knees out three times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will see his better.</v>

1596
01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a different animal.</v>

1597
01:14:33.611 --> 01:14:35.000
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1598
01:14:35.001 --> 01:14:37.480
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that sometimes people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are just supreme.</v>

1599
01:14:37.481 --> 01:14:38.314
<v Speaker 1>We talented physically and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to deal with as many trials and </v>

1600
01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:42.820
<v Speaker 1>tribulations in that regard.</v>

1601
01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:45.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very gifted like John.</v>

1602
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:47.170
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

1603
01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:48.333
<v Speaker 1>I've always said this there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a way that John gets a hold of </v>

1604
01:14:51.551 --> 01:14:52.384
<v Speaker 1>people that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could almost tell when he gets a </v>

1605
01:14:55.471 --> 01:14:58.330
<v Speaker 1>hold of them that they've really have </v>
<v Speaker 1>never felt anything like that before.</v>

1606
01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.313
<v Speaker 1>And you saw it with DC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know dc who's a supreme really </v>

1607
01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.080
<v Speaker 1>talented wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the best wrestlers to ever</v>

1608
01:15:05.081 --> 01:15:05.914
<v Speaker 1>compete in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones got ahold of them and you </v>

1609
01:15:08.231 --> 01:15:10.720
<v Speaker 1>could see dc was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

1610
01:15:11.050 --> 01:15:13.210
<v Speaker 1>like this guy is no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1611
01:15:13.211 --> 01:15:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean John's stud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1612
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:19.630
<v Speaker 1>he's that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not good.</v>

1613
01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Is that good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so was DC.</v>

1614
01:15:21.131 --> 01:15:21.964
<v Speaker 1>The DC could still beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that it's entirely </v>

1615
01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:26.800
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was still a very close fight.</v>

1616
01:15:26.801 --> 01:15:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I would probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had to choose on paper,</v>

1617
01:15:29.370 --> 01:15:32.050
<v Speaker 1>you take Jones depending on how healthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>he is.</v>

1618
01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Well DC was so furious that he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight it in the oven.</v>

1619
01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:36.130
<v Speaker 1>St [inaudible] fight because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1620
01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I would've beat that Jon Jones because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did commentary with them.</v>

1621
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've beat that Jon Jones and,</v>

1622
01:15:40.781 --> 01:15:42.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's another thing on that.</v>

1623
01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because how's that?</v>

1624
01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:46.773
<v Speaker 1>That might not be true either because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Jon Jones would have trained </v>

1625
01:15:49.781 --> 01:15:54.781
<v Speaker 1>differently for you than he who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was a very late replacement.</v>

1626
01:15:56.171 --> 01:15:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget this though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how much does he hate dc?</v>

1627
01:15:59.171 --> 01:16:01.020
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1628
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.943
<v Speaker 1>That was a different level of training </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing for different people and </v>

1629
01:16:04.071 --> 01:16:05.980
<v Speaker 1>where your emotions are with that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

1630
01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:07.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1631
01:16:07.451 --> 01:16:09.850
<v Speaker 1>And don't you think that was a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor in the first fight as well?</v>

1632
01:16:09.851 --> 01:16:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Because DC was very emotionally wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and finding John.</v>

1633
01:16:12.491 --> 01:16:15.910
<v Speaker 1>It was very intense because he had never</v>
<v Speaker 1>had anybody disrespect him like that.</v>

1634
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:19.180
<v Speaker 1>They had that fistfight at the press had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with it.</v>

1635
01:16:19.210 --> 01:16:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1636
01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:22.390
<v Speaker 1>That has to do with every fight has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with my flight.</v>

1637
01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:24.530
<v Speaker 1>It has to do with all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to calculate it.</v>

1638
01:16:24.531 --> 01:16:25.390
<v Speaker 1>I had to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conor mcgregor,</v>

1639
01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:27.003
<v Speaker 1>Rousey's fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva's fights when he's </v>

1640
01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:31.300
<v Speaker 1>showboating everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can go.</v>

1641
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:35.340
<v Speaker 1>The list goes on to the mental problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of these athletes have hadn't</v>

1642
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:37.300
<v Speaker 1>usually at the mental isn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lose.</v>

1643
01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.093
<v Speaker 1>It comes down to that and you also got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go back to the way Daniel cormier </v>

1644
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.513
<v Speaker 1>handled rumble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the only guy that's been able to </v>

1645
01:16:44.411 --> 01:16:47.980
<v Speaker 1>eat rumble shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorb them and come back and break him.</v>

1646
01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:49.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a.</v>

1647
01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:50.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1648
01:16:50.351 --> 01:16:53.260
<v Speaker 1>he ate that right hand and just hit his </v>
<v Speaker 1>head on the floor,</v>

1649
01:16:53.261 --> 01:16:56.530
<v Speaker 1>woke back up and then went after it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1650
01:16:57.130 --> 01:16:57.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's respectable to that that I don't </v>

1651
01:16:59.651 --> 01:17:03.940
<v Speaker 1>think fans or anybody can really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what it takes to get slightly</v>

1652
01:17:03.941 --> 01:17:06.970
<v Speaker 1>knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand back up and want to keep going.</v>

1653
01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:07.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different level of </v>

1654
01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:10.940
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as an athlete,</v>

1655
01:17:10.941 --> 01:17:14.000
<v Speaker 1>when I watch a fight or go through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and keep their composure,</v>

1656
01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:14.834
<v Speaker 1>move around and deal with that problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then even if they lose but stay in </v>

1657
01:17:18.921 --> 01:17:20.810
<v Speaker 1>the fight and go the distance and tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>

1658
01:17:20.811 --> 01:17:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Like Diego Sanchez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great example of that.</v>

1659
01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:26.880
<v Speaker 1>So like how do you not respect and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a,</v>

1660
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.393
<v Speaker 1>a real logical understanding of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being is built from something </v>

1661
01:17:30.921 --> 01:17:33.560
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1662
01:17:33.561 --> 01:17:34.394
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's fighters that come back and his </v>

1663
01:17:36.831 --> 01:17:39.410
<v Speaker 1>fighters had almost never come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

1664
01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talking about like Bj Penn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the all time greats,</v>

1665
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:45.440
<v Speaker 1>a can't remember a fight where Bj was </v>
<v Speaker 1>losing,</v>

1666
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:48.110
<v Speaker 1>where he came back and won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankie Edgar,</v>

1667
01:17:48.111 --> 01:17:48.944
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can never count that motherfucker </v>

1668
01:17:50.631 --> 01:17:51.464
<v Speaker 1>out ever true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankie Edgar in the gray maynard </v>

1669
01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:54.134
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's to those two chaotic fights was </v>

1670
01:17:56.241 --> 01:17:59.720
<v Speaker 1>so close to being stopped in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>round were gray.</v>

1671
01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:00.553
<v Speaker 1>Maynard is putting it on him and Frankie</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going down and down again and </v>

1672
01:18:03.951 --> 01:18:04.784
<v Speaker 1>stumbling around the octagon and gray </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch keeps catching him and frankie </v>

1673
01:18:08.811 --> 01:18:10.640
<v Speaker 1>goes on to stop him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1674
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:13.760
<v Speaker 1>that was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then those two fights were insane and he</v>

1675
01:18:13.761 --> 01:18:15.580
<v Speaker 1>should go down as one of the best ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

1676
01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:17.630
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like stuff like that,</v>

1677
01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:18.523
<v Speaker 1>those fights where they want to withdraw</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the other one when he beat </v>

1678
01:18:21.021 --> 01:18:21.890
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's true.</v>

1679
01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:25.220
<v Speaker 1>You gotta it's hard though because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many crazy fights.</v>

1680
01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.800
<v Speaker 1>He can get credit to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1681
01:18:27.801 --> 01:18:31.050
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you really dictate who gets what?</v>

1682
01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:32.993
<v Speaker 1>Because they're all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all putting our life out there on </v>

1683
01:18:34.461 --> 01:18:36.910
<v Speaker 1>the line too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every single one of these,</v>

1684
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:37.783
<v Speaker 1>just as serious as the next and every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single one of us is sacrifice just as </v>

1685
01:18:40.641 --> 01:18:41.474
<v Speaker 1>much as the next.</v>

1686
01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:42.493
<v Speaker 1>So at what point do you really start </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing the line as to who is the best </v>

1687
01:18:45.801 --> 01:18:48.440
<v Speaker 1>and who was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it has to come down to who stays</v>

1688
01:18:48.441 --> 01:18:50.060
<v Speaker 1>the longest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1689
01:18:50.090 --> 01:18:52.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you was really,</v>

1690
01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.200
<v Speaker 1>that's why I put fate or overcame as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best heavyweight of all time.</v>

1691
01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Although I still think I maintain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cane when he was at his best.</v>

1692
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:06.710
<v Speaker 1>It was far as like what I see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was able to do two guys and what</v>

1693
01:19:06.711 --> 01:19:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I see from his performance inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>octagon,</v>

1694
01:19:08.751 --> 01:19:13.600
<v Speaker 1>especially his cardio as a heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 1>is clean technique is wrestling the pace</v>

1695
01:19:13.601 --> 01:19:14.434
<v Speaker 1>he puts on guys his chin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there has been ever </v>

1696
01:19:17.001 --> 01:19:17.834
<v Speaker 1>anybody like Cain I think came when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was at his prime was the best I've ever </v>

1697
01:19:20.151 --> 01:19:22.580
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never got to see fate or fight live,</v>

1698
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:26.150
<v Speaker 1>but I would say if you have to give an </v>
<v Speaker 1>all time great to a heavyweight.</v>

1699
01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:29.540
<v Speaker 1>I kind of leaned towards fader because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he stayed on top longer,</v>

1700
01:19:29.541 --> 01:19:30.374
<v Speaker 1>beat more guys longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously be compared to cane Noguera </v>

1701
01:19:34.191 --> 01:19:38.480
<v Speaker 1>and his prime cro cop in his prime </v>
<v Speaker 1>fought some freaks,</v>

1702
01:19:38.481 --> 01:19:41.890
<v Speaker 1>like semi Schiltz took him down and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was in the early days.</v>

1703
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when like it was still very limited.</v>

1704
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:48.210
<v Speaker 1>It was wild rules as far as supplements </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1705
01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Take whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

1737
01:21:02.581 --> 01:21:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1738
01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no old guy yelling at me.</v>

1739
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:06.833
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you always have to have that </v>

1740
01:21:09.001 --> 01:21:12.800
<v Speaker 1>asterisk next pride that there was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug testing and I've had an incident.</v>

1741
01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:14.880
<v Speaker 1>You went here on a couple times where </v>
<v Speaker 1>anthony was talking about it.</v>

1742
01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.060
<v Speaker 1>They're in the contracts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It said in capital letters,</v>

1743
01:21:18.210 --> 01:21:23.210
<v Speaker 1>we will not test you for steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Ensign was laughing about it.</v>

1744
01:21:23.221 --> 01:21:24.600
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1745
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this what I'm fighting?</v>

1746
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:28.740
<v Speaker 1>But they were just selling you like we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have some fun.</v>

1747
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:29.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I remember even because I was part </v>

1748
01:21:31.141 --> 01:21:34.050
<v Speaker 1>of the sport in the air and I'm so glad </v>
<v Speaker 1>I really am.</v>

1749
01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:36.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad I was part of the sport </v>
<v Speaker 2>during that time.</v>

1750
01:21:36.131 --> 01:21:38.650
<v Speaker 2>And I was just coming up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like maybe two,</v>

1751
01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:39.513
<v Speaker 2>three and know at this point when I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically remember a time having to </v>

1752
01:21:42.911 --> 01:21:47.530
<v Speaker 2>make a decision at 21 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I want to be in the IFL?</v>

1753
01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:48.933
<v Speaker 2>Do I want to go try out for the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter or do I just keep working with </v>

1754
01:21:52.570 --> 01:21:53.520
<v Speaker 2>three jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coaching,</v>

1755
01:21:53.530 --> 01:21:55.390
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing what I'm doing here in Tucson as a</v>

1756
01:21:55.391 --> 01:21:56.224
<v Speaker 2>janitor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay with my money in and just be </v>

1757
01:21:57.761 --> 01:22:00.310
<v Speaker 2>patient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep winning fights until I get there.</v>

1758
01:22:01.090 --> 01:22:04.540
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 20 years old.</v>

1759
01:22:05.290 --> 01:22:10.290
<v Speaker 2>They were offering me $2,000 a month to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight in the IFL with the sabers,</v>

1760
01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.173
<v Speaker 2>which was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was forever ago in $2,000 a month </v>

1761
01:22:18.281 --> 01:22:20.080
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it changed my life?</v>

1762
01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm 20 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1763
01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:24.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm living paycheck to paycheck and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing all these jobs.</v>

1764
01:22:24.490 --> 01:22:27.430
<v Speaker 2>I can quit all my jobs and focus on </v>
<v Speaker 2>training 24 slash seven.</v>

1765
01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:30.190
<v Speaker 2>That's my mindset with $2,000 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heck yeah,</v>

1766
01:22:30.191 --> 01:22:31.870
<v Speaker 2>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to go.</v>

1767
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:34.990
<v Speaker 2>But wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no 135 pound weight class.</v>

1768
01:22:34.991 --> 01:22:38.080
<v Speaker 2>There's no 145 pound weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only 1:55 and up.</v>

1769
01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:43.090
<v Speaker 2>So I'm already eating as much as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to put weight on and get into the</v>

1770
01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:46.060
<v Speaker 2>weight class to fight at 155 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you walk around?</v>

1771
01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:50.170
<v Speaker 2>And then right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm walking around 55 60,</v>

1772
01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.273
<v Speaker 2>but then at 20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 to 142 pounds trying to eat </v>

1773
01:22:55.871 --> 01:23:00.871
<v Speaker 2>everything I can insight and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between that and 50,</v>

1774
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:02.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1:50.</v>

1775
01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:03.483
<v Speaker 2>So I said you're too small for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt if they lock you into that </v>

1776
01:23:06.041 --> 01:23:08.950
<v Speaker 2>contract for two grand a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to throw you out there,</v>

1777
01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:09.670
<v Speaker 2>you're going to lose twice.</v>

1778
01:23:09.670 --> 01:23:11.890
<v Speaker 2>They're going to cut you and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't get any money and you lost.</v>

1779
01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:12.933
<v Speaker 2>Now you got to losses on your record </v>
<v Speaker 2>because these guys are monsters and how </v>

1780
01:23:17.981 --> 01:23:19.510
<v Speaker 2>do you come back from that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>

1781
01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:20.650
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say no to that.</v>

1782
01:23:20.651 --> 01:23:21.484
<v Speaker 2>I fell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to trial for the </v>

1783
01:23:21.761 --> 01:23:23.800
<v Speaker 2>ultimate fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try it out for the ultimate fighter.</v>

1784
01:23:23.801 --> 01:23:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Didn't get in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost that opportunity.</v>

1785
01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:30.310
<v Speaker 2>So then I just kept training and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got my first fight at six and now</v>

1786
01:23:30.311 --> 01:23:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I was five.</v>

1787

<v Speaker 2>got an offer on two days notice to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and total combat,</v>

1788
01:23:35.051 --> 01:23:35.884

1789
01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:42.550

<v Speaker 2>fought it,</v>

1790
01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:44.710

<v Speaker 2>2005 when you started out was right when</v>

<v Speaker 2>ultimate fighter season one and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>launched mma and that's what made me </v>

1825
01:25:17.081 --> 01:25:19.120
<v Speaker 2>decide and that's when I'm going to </v>

1833

<v Speaker 2>That was the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

1834
01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I do?</v>

1835
01:25:38.741 --> 01:25:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Do I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have so much stability.</v>

1836
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:43.090
<v Speaker 2>I got three jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got money coming in,</v>

1837
01:25:43.091 --> 01:25:44.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to school,</v>

1838
01:25:44.651 --> 01:25:46.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

1839
01:25:46.811 --> 01:25:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Twenty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

1840
01:25:47.741 --> 01:25:51.640
<v Speaker 2>20 year old vision for a kid who wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be something right,</v>

1841
01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.020
<v Speaker 2>going to school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

1842
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I threw it all away and just said screw </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1843
01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.410
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was nerve wracking,</v>

1844
01:25:59.411 --> 01:26:01.380
<v Speaker 2>but like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do it until I asked my mom.</v>

1845
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:03.860
<v Speaker 2>My mom didn't even the fact that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even like</v>

1846
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.710
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't think about it.</v>

1847
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think about.</v>

1848
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:11.960
<v Speaker 1>I just quit my job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>packed all my shit up in an eclipse.</v>

1849
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:13.303
<v Speaker 1>My car couldn't make it to California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had to have my friend's truck tow </v>

1850
01:26:16.791 --> 01:26:19.800
<v Speaker 1>it on a trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything I owned in the car.</v>

1851
01:26:19.801 --> 01:26:20.634
<v Speaker 1>And then we drove the truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Semi truck basically became a shed for </v>

1852
01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:26.330
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my card in my car,</v>

1853
01:26:26.331 --> 01:26:27.920
<v Speaker 1>became a set for everything I owned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1854
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Move out there.</v>

1855
01:26:29.321 --> 01:26:31.310
<v Speaker 1>But so many stories like that come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1856
01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:33.050
<v Speaker 1>how many MMA fighters have that story at</v>
<v Speaker 1>ton.</v>

1857
01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:34.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what is interesting to go back to </v>

1858
01:26:34.971 --> 01:26:35.804
<v Speaker 1>your style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very unique style is that you </v>

1859
01:26:37.221 --> 01:26:40.100
<v Speaker 1>really did come along when the sport was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in its.</v>

1860
01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it's infancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like a teenager at the time.</v>

1861
01:26:43.521 --> 01:26:45.770
<v Speaker 1>The sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sport was really only 12,</v>

1862
01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:50.150
<v Speaker 1>13 years old and I'm so glad I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything because that exact fact,</v>

1863
01:26:50.151 --> 01:26:52.970
<v Speaker 1>what you just mentioned is why I knew I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do something different.</v>

1864
01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:54.463
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was growing and there was so </v>

1865
01:26:55.881 --> 01:27:00.440
<v Speaker 1>much room to knew I could do things </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody had ever seen and it wasn't wrong</v>

1866
01:27:00.441 --> 01:27:02.550
<v Speaker 1>anymore because this is new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1867
01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:04.610
<v Speaker 1>And if you say I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say fuck you.</v>

1868
01:27:04.611 --> 01:27:07.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it my way because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is new where there wasn't an established</v>

1869
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:09.060
<v Speaker 1>orthodox like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1870
01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.090
<v Speaker 1>there was the style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was though,</v>

1871
01:27:11.091 --> 01:27:13.160
<v Speaker 1>and I got rid of killed my whole career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there,</v>

1872
01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:14.890
<v Speaker 1>like in the household,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were they saying to you?</v>

1873
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:16.940
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're boxing.</v>

1874
01:27:16.941 --> 01:27:17.774
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're kickbox and you're not supposed </v>

1875
01:27:19.311 --> 01:27:20.270
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wrestling,</v>

1876
01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:23.060
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not doing any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing them all mixed together.</v>

1877
01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.790
<v Speaker 1>So how are you telling me I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong right now?</v>

1878
01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:26.673
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that are said about </v>

1879
01:27:26.961 --> 01:27:28.610
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1880
01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:32.840
<v Speaker 1>if you watch dominick Cruz fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would tell you don't fight like that,</v>

1881
01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:34.213
<v Speaker 1>but look how God damn good he is at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't say don't fight like that </v>

1882
01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:41.240
<v Speaker 1>because he's not just like the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw punches,</v>

1883
01:27:41.241 --> 01:27:44.180
<v Speaker 1>the way you move and throw punches and </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw punches from odd angles.</v>

1884
01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:45.283
<v Speaker 1>You could tell someone if someone was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a very traditional technical coach </v>

1885
01:27:49.301 --> 01:27:50.870
<v Speaker 1>who would say that is the wrong way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw punches,</v>

1886
01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:52.033
<v Speaker 1>but I would say no because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking landing them and they're </v>

1887
01:27:56.151 --> 01:27:59.520
<v Speaker 1>hurting the guy and he uses them a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>as very effective with.</v>

1888
01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:03.470
<v Speaker 1>That will always be my argument with </v>
<v Speaker 1>every conventional coach and this is why</v>

1889
01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes them relevant?</v>

1890
01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:07.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily you break what </v>

1891
01:28:08.421 --> 01:28:09.254
<v Speaker 1>makes them relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You figure out a way to make your style </v>

1892
01:28:11.151 --> 01:28:14.430
<v Speaker 1>work in a way that confounds the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experts.</v>

1893
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I mean by that is when they talk to</v>

1894
01:28:16.401 --> 01:28:20.870
<v Speaker 1>me maybe not to $20 million other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1895
01:28:20.871 --> 01:28:23.870
<v Speaker 1>they are that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you try to tell me that,</v>

1896
01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:24.973
<v Speaker 1>and I've had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you how many countless </v>

1897
01:28:26.661 --> 01:28:30.260
<v Speaker 1>world champion kick boxing coaches go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only you can do that.</v>

1898
01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:31.400
<v Speaker 1>You're awesome.</v>

1899
01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I and I couldn't disagree more.</v>

1900
01:28:34.670 --> 01:28:35.503
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody can do it if they mimic your </v>

1901
01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:37.544
<v Speaker 1>movements and your movements aren't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cirque de Solei movements that you have </v>

1902
01:28:39.681 --> 01:28:40.514
<v Speaker 1>to be like physically gifted in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull off or work towards them for 100 </v>

1903
01:28:43.731 --> 01:28:44.510
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1904
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:45.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to sit here and break it </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

1905
01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:49.460
<v Speaker 1>but there are obviously movements that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing and they can be read.</v>

1906
01:28:49.461 --> 01:28:53.390
<v Speaker 1>It took 30 rounds to figure out what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same camp for 10 years,</v>

1907
01:28:53.391 --> 01:28:54.910
<v Speaker 1>but they figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1908
01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.780
<v Speaker 1>You know they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can imitate.</v>

1909
01:28:56.781 --> 01:28:58.510
<v Speaker 1>You ever see Justin Buchholz do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1910
01:28:58.850 --> 01:29:00.470
<v Speaker 1>They're usually pretty well know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing,</v>

1911
01:29:00.471 --> 01:29:02.280
<v Speaker 1>but who</v>

1912
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:04.320
<v Speaker 2>else has fought somebody as much as they</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought me.</v>

1913
01:29:04.321 --> 01:29:05.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm essentially every single person I've</v>

<v Speaker 2>some point been friends with favorite </v>

1920
01:29:24.511 --> 01:29:25.344
<v Speaker 2>trained with that camp because they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little guy camp while I said why </v>

1921
01:29:28.621 --> 01:29:29.454
<v Speaker 2>join them if you can beat them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just did it my own way and let </v>

1922
01:29:31.921 --> 01:29:34.890
<v Speaker 2>them all hate me and trained together </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was okay with me,</v>

1923
01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:38.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I needed to do things my way in order to</v>

1924
01:29:38.041 --> 01:29:38.874
<v Speaker 2>build something different in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a game that hadn't really caught up </v>

1925
01:29:42.661 --> 01:29:45.090
<v Speaker 2>to the things that I was thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet in my opinion.</v>

1926
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't make me.</v>

1927
01:29:46.591 --> 01:29:47.424
<v Speaker 2>The only one that was right in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things is just how I used the things </v>

1928
01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:51.900
<v Speaker 2>that I used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had theirs too.</v>

1929
01:29:52.230 --> 01:29:55.410
<v Speaker 2>But my whole mindset was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1930
01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:56.753
<v Speaker 2>if I fight like them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be like them and they're </v>

1931
01:29:58.201 --> 01:30:01.200
<v Speaker 2>going to adjust to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they adjust everybody else.</v>

1932
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Now going back to the early days when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you sort of learn the style,</v>

1933
01:30:04.811 --> 01:30:05.644
<v Speaker 3>we kind of got off this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I really wanted to touch back on it </v>

1934
01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:12.660
<v Speaker 3>when you said that your style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one had your style before.</v>

1935
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:14.103
<v Speaker 3>No one could tell you that it was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong way to do it because you're being </v>

1936
01:30:17.531 --> 01:30:18.364
<v Speaker 3>very effective with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but did you take it from anywhere and </v>

1937
01:30:20.851 --> 01:30:25.390
<v Speaker 3>did you look at boxing footage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you look at kickboxing or Muay Thai?</v>

1938
01:30:25.391 --> 01:30:27.340
<v Speaker 3>Like where did you get all your foot </v>
<v Speaker 3>work from?</v>

1939
01:30:27.370 --> 01:30:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a mixture of things.</v>

1940
01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:29.433
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all started with me fighting at 155 </v>

1941
01:30:32.471 --> 01:30:34.300
<v Speaker 2>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weighing 142 pounds.</v>

1942
01:30:34.301 --> 01:30:35.134
<v Speaker 2>That's where this whole mindset started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was there already twice as big as </v>

1943
01:30:38.861 --> 01:30:41.170
<v Speaker 2>you and on fight day they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>three times as big as you,</v>

1944
01:30:41.650 --> 01:30:42.483
<v Speaker 2>so you better not get touched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better not get grabbed and you </v>

1945
01:30:44.321 --> 01:30:45.154
<v Speaker 2>better not get hit at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't let him touch you because they're </v>

1946
01:30:46.781 --> 01:30:48.370
<v Speaker 2>too big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take you down.</v>

1947
01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Your energy is going to be zapped by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time you do get up.</v>

1948
01:30:50.710 --> 01:30:51.543
<v Speaker 2>If you get up and if the hit you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're big and strong and they're </v>

1949
01:30:54.341 --> 01:30:57.340
<v Speaker 2>probably going to put you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to use all that strength,</v>

1950
01:30:57.341 --> 01:30:58.174
<v Speaker 2>all that size against them and make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>their weakness instead of their </v>

1951
01:31:00.881 --> 01:31:01.714
<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I started because I was </v>

1952
01:31:03.101 --> 01:31:05.280
<v Speaker 2>so little that I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1953
01:31:05.290 --> 01:31:06.580
<v Speaker 2>I need to focus on defense.</v>

1954
01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I got to hurt him too.</v>

1955
01:31:08.741 --> 01:31:09.574
<v Speaker 2>But after they do what they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with their big strength and be </v>

1956
01:31:12.791 --> 01:31:14.980
<v Speaker 2>stronger and be more powerful and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>more athletic,</v>

1957
01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:16.053
<v Speaker 2>they're going to wear themselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then now we're even round middle </v>

1958
01:31:19.151 --> 01:31:19.984
<v Speaker 2>around to all those things that they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>early where even now and now I can just </v>

1959
01:31:23.150 --> 01:31:24.670
<v Speaker 2>sell them and pick them apart and beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1960
01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:30.180
<v Speaker 2>And I always had that mentality rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than fight fire with fire.</v>

1961
01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:33.730
<v Speaker 2>It just didn't make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When my body was on the line,</v>

1962
01:31:33.731 --> 01:31:34.564
<v Speaker 2>I wanted the path of least resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it started with that until I got </v>

1963
01:31:38.771 --> 01:31:41.440
<v Speaker 2>to about five and l five in total </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat.</v>

1964
01:31:42.190 --> 01:31:45.260
<v Speaker 2>I took that fight on two days notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went out there with no coaches,</v>

1965
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:46.143
<v Speaker 2>no corner men and women myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just picked corner mit random </v>

1966
01:31:48.071 --> 01:31:52.000
<v Speaker 2>corner men and put them in out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that night was why eric liked me because</v>

1967
01:31:52.001 --> 01:31:53.290
<v Speaker 2>he saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1968
01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:54.810
<v Speaker 2>I took it at short notice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>won it.</v>

1969
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:56.980
<v Speaker 2>It was a tough fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had no car man.</v>

1970
01:31:56.981 --> 01:32:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I came solo on a flight and just went </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so he's like,</v>

1971
01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:01.690
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can work with this,</v>

1972
01:32:01.691 --> 01:32:02.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy wants to do it.</v>

1973
01:32:02.891 --> 01:32:03.724
<v Speaker 2>So he picked me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then that's really when the </v>

1974
01:32:05.651 --> 01:32:09.910
<v Speaker 2>progression started meeting Eric like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's because I'd never had.</v>

1975
01:32:09.970 --> 01:32:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had pads held for me here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there in Tucson,</v>

1976
01:32:12.341 --> 01:32:13.174
<v Speaker 2>but only if guys were getting 65 bucks </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it or something for it because </v>

1977
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:20.080
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of money and fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

1978
01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:20.973
<v Speaker 2>So they're all as hungry as I am the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trainers and I wasn't really like some </v>

1979
01:32:25.511 --> 01:32:26.344
<v Speaker 2>star pupil that everybody wanted to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>on board and make a world champion at </v>

1980
01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:31.390
<v Speaker 2>this point I was just a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1981
01:32:31.930 --> 01:32:35.620
<v Speaker 2>So I wasn't getting pad work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't getting one on one training.</v>

1982
01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:36.813
<v Speaker 2>I lined up my own coaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have guys that knew what they were </v>

1983
01:32:38.951 --> 01:32:40.210
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being pro boxers,</v>

1984
01:32:40.211 --> 01:32:41.044
<v Speaker 2>pro high level wrestlers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high level blue belts at this time and </v>

1985
01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:44.793
<v Speaker 2>role and wrestle and make my own team </v>
<v Speaker 2>and my own coaches with the people that </v>

1986
01:32:48.161 --> 01:32:48.994
<v Speaker 2>I had available,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't have a head and when I </v>

1987
01:32:51.821 --> 01:32:55.090
<v Speaker 2>found eric at six and I won that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>found eric and he said,</v>

1988
01:32:55.091 --> 01:32:55.924
<v Speaker 2>I'll coach you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get you a manager and I'll get all </v>

1989
01:32:57.491 --> 01:33:00.640
<v Speaker 2>this figured out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was really looking for.</v>

1990
01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:02.403
<v Speaker 2>That's why I went to California and got </v>
<v Speaker 2>Outta Tucson's because I knew I wasn't </v>

1991
01:33:05.141 --> 01:33:08.980
<v Speaker 2>finding that in Tucson when I went there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and got that,</v>

1992
01:33:08.981 --> 01:33:10.150
<v Speaker 2>it was like a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1993
01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:11.073
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew if I went there and one with no </v>

1994
01:33:13.391 --> 01:33:15.340
<v Speaker 2>one in my corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody would want to pick me up.</v>

1995
01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:16.983
<v Speaker 2>And they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric did and we stayed together ever </v>

1996
01:33:18.341 --> 01:33:19.174
<v Speaker 2>since.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was your style something that you </v>

1997
01:33:21.881 --> 01:33:25.270
<v Speaker 2>worked on with Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like learning those footwork drills?</v>

1998
01:33:25.271 --> 01:33:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you came to him,</v>

1999
01:33:27.210 --> 01:33:30.050
<v Speaker 2>you have essentially we're a smaller guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were fa,</v>

2000
01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:33.630
<v Speaker 2>was fighting bigger guys and had to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little trickier in your movement.</v>

2001
01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Where were you getting that stuff from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now I,</v>

2002
01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:37.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I meet Eric,</v>

2003
01:33:37.150 --> 01:33:40.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm no longer the smaller guy fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger guys because,</v>

2004
01:33:40.090 --> 01:33:41.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit,</v>

2005
01:33:41.021 --> 01:33:44.080
<v Speaker 2>but 45 and 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 is now allowed.</v>

2006
01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Now 145 pounds is just getting into </v>
<v Speaker 2>these small shows,</v>

2007
01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:52.380
<v Speaker 2>not just the WEC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the time I met Eric at six and no,</v>

2008
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:53.743
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take that fight on two days notice at </v>

2009
01:33:55.571 --> 01:33:58.870
<v Speaker 2>145 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was getting ready to fight at 1:55</v>

2010
01:33:58.871 --> 01:34:01.840
<v Speaker 2>in Colorado for a world title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the whole show got canceled.</v>

2011
01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:04.360
<v Speaker 2>That's why I was in shape to take the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight on two days notice.</v>

2012
01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:09.640
<v Speaker 2>So when I met Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 45 pound weight class was there 55?</v>

2013
01:34:10.230 --> 01:34:12.730
<v Speaker 2>A was the one that was basking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

2014
01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:17.820
<v Speaker 2>that was how I got into the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your question exactly was what was,</v>

2015
01:34:18.190 --> 01:34:21.940
<v Speaker 2>how did you devise your movement?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you devise your footwork?</v>

2016
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Did you study other stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you learn it with Eric?</v>

2017
01:34:25.090 --> 01:34:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Did you guys put it together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

2018
01:34:27.701 --> 01:34:28.534
<v Speaker 2>like I had a couple things that I did </v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally and then Eric and Eric has a </v>

2019
01:34:31.571 --> 01:34:36.130
<v Speaker 2>skillset where he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a natural movement,</v>

2020
01:34:36.190 --> 01:34:40.250
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't tell you to to fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lets you do it and then turns it in,</v>

2021
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:44.980
<v Speaker 2>has you add a weapon to it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his gift and I had a lot of those</v>

2022
01:34:44.981 --> 01:34:49.300
<v Speaker 2>little weird things that I did and those</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird odd things you had just devised to</v>

2023
01:34:49.301 --> 01:34:50.770
<v Speaker 2>learn how to bigger people.</v>

2024
01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:51.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is a mixture of wrestling stance </v>

2025
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:56.980
<v Speaker 2>with punching and kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of have a.</v>

2026
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:59.840
<v Speaker 2>If you watch wrestling that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>set stance.</v>

2027
01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:02.600
<v Speaker 2>There's no set w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2028
01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:04.280
<v Speaker 2>It's constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you watch college,</v>

2029
01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.620
<v Speaker 2>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the highest level wrestlers,</v>

2030
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:07.603
<v Speaker 2>it's all fluid motion in both stances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I made fighting that because I </v>

2031
01:35:11.181 --> 01:35:12.014
<v Speaker 2>started out wrestling and then I added </v>
<v Speaker 2>the punches and the kicks to that move </v>

2032
01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:15.913
<v Speaker 2>to that motion instead of trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change what I already did with my </v>

2033
01:35:18.261 --> 01:35:19.094
<v Speaker 2>wrestling and try to make it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just let me do what I did up to five </v>

2034
01:35:23.351 --> 01:35:27.290
<v Speaker 2>and o with my wrestling and whatever I </v>
<v Speaker 2>taught myself and then he just tightened</v>

2035
01:35:27.291 --> 01:35:30.590
<v Speaker 2>it up and made it into a pro level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look to an extent,</v>

2036
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:33.950
<v Speaker 2>speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>timing range,</v>

2037
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.843
<v Speaker 2>these type of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now what do you have it now as a </v>

2038
01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:37.850
<v Speaker 2>system?</v>

2039
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:40.760
<v Speaker 2>Do you have it organized?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a town now?</v>

2040
01:35:40.761 --> 01:35:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I have a system but I'm a visual learner</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could.</v>

2041
01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.713
<v Speaker 2>You could literally just do a movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of me and I'll learn it really </v>

2042
01:35:47.421 --> 01:35:48.254
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you write it or I have to read </v>

2043
01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:50.744
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never get it.</v>

2044
01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:54.110
<v Speaker 2>It's all visual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just.</v>

2045
01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:55.353
<v Speaker 2>There are certain things that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>running into when I would spar early on </v>

2046
01:35:59.031 --> 01:36:03.680
<v Speaker 2>starting that I came up with habits to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with because of my wrestling and my</v>

2047
01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:06.610
<v Speaker 2>and and not having a coach that instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the coach saying,</v>

2048
01:36:06.611 --> 01:36:07.430
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this,</v>

2049
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:08.263
<v Speaker 2>I just adjusted and found my own answers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do keep a training log of all these </v>

2050
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:15.280
<v Speaker 2>lessons that you learned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nod.</v>

2051
01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I know them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just all in your mind.</v>

2052
01:36:17.241 --> 01:36:18.074
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know him.</v>

2053
01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:19.520
<v Speaker 2>I know him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know him very well.</v>

2054
01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Studied it 100 percent confident that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you keep that stuff in your memory.</v>

2055
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:23.750
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2056
01:36:23.751 --> 01:36:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to write it down because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>drill it at once.</v>

2057
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I have a memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't just write it.</v>

2058
01:36:28.041 --> 01:36:29.510
<v Speaker 2>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drill it,</v>

2059
01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:32.810
<v Speaker 2>pad work a show Eric and I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about this?</v>

2060
01:36:32.811 --> 01:36:33.471
<v Speaker 2>And he'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2061
01:36:33.471 --> 01:36:35.390
<v Speaker 2>well I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and this to make it a little better</v>

2062
01:36:35.391 --> 01:36:36.224
<v Speaker 2>and keep you dah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dah,</v>

2063
01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Dah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we use it.</v>

2064
01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:39.313
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I'm using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not using the craziest moves in the </v>

2065
01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:43.551
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2066
01:36:43.551 --> 01:36:48.551
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones used crazy moves a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like a Stevens,</v>

2067
01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Steven Thompson throat has crazy moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2068
01:36:54.410 --> 01:36:55.243
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually using crazy movements to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay defensive and offensive </v>

2069
01:36:57.951 --> 01:37:00.020
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2070
01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:00.973
<v Speaker 2>that's the idea to do both at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and to be very hard to read what </v>

2071
01:37:04.501 --> 01:37:05.334
<v Speaker 2>you're hard to read if you're being </v>
<v Speaker 2>offensive and defensive at the same </v>

2072
01:37:07.251 --> 01:37:07.820
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2073
01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2074
01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:11.120
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to read because you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm being offensive or defensive.</v>

2075
01:37:11.121 --> 01:37:16.100
<v Speaker 2>It's one or the other or both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do both because where I put myself</v>

2076
01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:19.920
<v Speaker 2>on defensively in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

2077
01:37:19.921 --> 01:37:20.754
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I've been doing very well in my </v>

2078
01:37:22.050 --> 01:37:23.870
<v Speaker 2>matchups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put myself in the,</v>

2079
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:25.243
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the gray area where even if you do </v>

2080
01:37:27.231 --> 01:37:29.810
<v Speaker 2>hit me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's limited power and I'm still able to</v>

2081
01:37:29.811 --> 01:37:31.970
<v Speaker 2>hit you more and you're able to hit me </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

2082
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:33.800
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2083
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:35.810
<v Speaker 2>generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here you are,</v>

2084
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:37.250
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're coming off of,</v>

2085
01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the toughest laws for your career.</v>

2086
01:37:39.351 --> 01:37:40.490
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lose to cody.</v>

2087
01:37:40.491 --> 01:37:41.324
<v Speaker 2>No love in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very tough fight against a super </v>

2088
01:37:43.161 --> 01:37:44.350
<v Speaker 2>talented guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2089
01:37:44.590 --> 01:37:47.060
<v Speaker 2>How did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about that fight and how</v>

2090
01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:49.130
<v Speaker 2>do you feel right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel good.</v>

2091
01:37:49.131 --> 01:37:52.880
<v Speaker 2>I just want to heal up my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body a little bit that that year,</v>

2092
01:37:52.881 --> 01:37:55.740
<v Speaker 2>doing the three camps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming back after the couch.</v>

2093
01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.790
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2094
01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:00.510
<v Speaker 2>it was the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a hard year.</v>

2095
01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:01.373
<v Speaker 2>It was a good year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was weren't conditioned when you </v>

2096
01:38:03.370 --> 01:38:06.720
<v Speaker 2>first started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that also affected my style.</v>

2097
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:07.583
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at the last three </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights this year and my fights before </v>

2098
01:38:10.531 --> 01:38:12.480
<v Speaker 2>the injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I threw a million more kicks.</v>

2099
01:38:12.570 --> 01:38:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you looked out standing against Uriah.</v>

2100
01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:17.100
<v Speaker 2>You looked like your body didn't look as</v>
<v Speaker 2>good with Tj.</v>

2101
01:38:17.101 --> 01:38:19.710
<v Speaker 2>You looked like I was her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2102
01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:20.813
<v Speaker 2>That was the one where I was hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell you tell physically by </v>

2103
01:38:22.891 --> 01:38:23.724
<v Speaker 2>looking and by the favorite fight I felt</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did strength training camp for that </v>

2104
01:38:28.021 --> 01:38:28.854
<v Speaker 2>whole camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the difference of having a </v>

2105
01:38:30.151 --> 01:38:33.750
<v Speaker 2>strength training camp and not having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>structured where the way you looked.</v>

2106
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:34.673
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my cardio was through the roof </v>

2107
01:38:35.850 --> 01:38:38.670
<v Speaker 2>because I implemented sprints instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength and the strength.</v>

2108
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:40.223
<v Speaker 2>Whereas for the favor of fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do strength training because I </v>

2109
01:38:41.851 --> 01:38:42.684
<v Speaker 2>had enough time and my sprints so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could double up on the workload to make </v>

2110
01:38:46.951 --> 01:38:49.290
<v Speaker 2>my body stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more fast,</v>

2111
01:38:49.291 --> 01:38:52.560
<v Speaker 2>more efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more than anything tougher to take,</v>

2112
01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:53.453
<v Speaker 2>better to take damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better your core tufting of or </v>

2113
01:38:55.870 --> 01:38:59.550
<v Speaker 2>everything in kids taking punches feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and day different now.</v>

2114
01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Even for the cody fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt great.</v>

2115
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:02.663
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do look at that fight and I think </v>

2116
01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:05.213
<v Speaker 2>maybe I could have waited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I knew a so I wouldn't overwork </v>

2117
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:10.560
<v Speaker 2>myself in that year with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2118
01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:15.620
<v Speaker 2>with the training and stuff because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing to take three fights in a year</v>

2119
01:39:15.661 --> 01:39:18.090
<v Speaker 2>and it's another thing to take three </v>
<v Speaker 2>title fights in a year.</v>

2120
01:39:18.150 --> 01:39:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can say whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fought six times this year.</v>

2121
01:39:20.581 --> 01:39:22.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you didn't fight three.</v>

2122
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:25.050
<v Speaker 2>You didn't go through three title fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>camps and then fight.</v>

2123
01:39:25.051 --> 01:39:28.380
<v Speaker 2>These guys were the best in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a different thing.</v>

2124
01:39:28.710 --> 01:39:31.970
<v Speaker 2>It's so much more work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to five rounds and it's a lot</v>

2125
01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:32.813
<v Speaker 2>of workload,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the camp is really where the damage </v>

2126
01:39:36.601 --> 01:39:37.590
<v Speaker 2>is done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that fight,</v>

2127
01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:39.660
<v Speaker 2>the camps are just painful for five </v>
<v Speaker 2>rounds,</v>

2128
01:39:39.661 --> 01:39:41.640
<v Speaker 2>just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2129
01:39:42.150 --> 01:39:42.983
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after getting through that fight with </v>

2130
01:39:43.651 --> 01:39:44.484
<v Speaker 2>cody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I just want to face the </v>

2131
01:39:45.871 --> 01:39:46.080
<v Speaker 2>winter.</v>

2132
01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:46.741
<v Speaker 2>Those two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2133
01:39:46.741 --> 01:39:48.360
<v Speaker 2>I think that he had a good night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a,</v>

2134
01:39:48.630 --> 01:39:50.730
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've fought that camp.</v>

2135
01:39:50.731 --> 01:39:51.564
<v Speaker 2>How many times men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how legitimately if you had to break </v>

2136
01:39:53.851 --> 01:39:54.684
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you went back and looked at </v>

2137
01:39:56.101 --> 01:39:56.934
<v Speaker 2>tape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could probably break down 30 rounds </v>

2138
01:39:59.610 --> 01:40:00.443
<v Speaker 2>with me in that camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means they have all those reads on </v>

2139
01:40:03.961 --> 01:40:06.510
<v Speaker 2>me through the years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then cody started out watching me in</v>

2140
01:40:06.511 --> 01:40:07.344
<v Speaker 2>junior high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school and then the way I look at </v>

2141
01:40:09.751 --> 01:40:13.830
<v Speaker 2>it is he's the one guy who could </v>
<v Speaker 2>implement it because he looked up to the</v>

2142
01:40:13.831 --> 01:40:14.664
<v Speaker 2>guys that wanted to beat me as they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit so at took down the ego from </v>

2143
01:40:22.981 --> 01:40:23.814
<v Speaker 2>him and allowed him to learn from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best guys that I've fought and really </v>

2144
01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:28.104
<v Speaker 2>taking that information and use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you give a guy like favor or tj </v>

2145
01:40:31.770 --> 01:40:34.290
<v Speaker 2>information and I guarantee you it's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>linear out the other.</v>

2146
01:40:34.291 --> 01:40:35.124
<v Speaker 2>They already know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't teach teachers learn a lot </v>

2147
01:40:37.051 --> 01:40:38.190
<v Speaker 2>from Dwayne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is now,</v>

2148
01:40:38.191 --> 01:40:39.024
<v Speaker 2>but I'm talking about then in that camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that cody was just like a </v>

2149
01:40:43.921 --> 01:40:44.754
<v Speaker 2>sponge for these guys because he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>young and so he came up in that camp as </v>

2150
01:40:48.121 --> 01:40:48.954
<v Speaker 2>a youngster and nothing those guys could</v>
<v Speaker 2>say to them would be wrong and so that </v>

2151
01:40:52.051 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 2>made him very with what he's</v>

2152
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:58.480
<v Speaker 1>doing today and then he's built his </v>
<v Speaker 1>style to be the champion,</v>

2153
01:40:58.481 --> 01:40:59.314
<v Speaker 1>which was me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a big factor in cody's ability </v>

2154
01:41:02.351 --> 01:41:07.240
<v Speaker 1>is also he came to mma from boxing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good hands.</v>

2155
01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His hands are outstanding.</v>

2156
01:41:09.191 --> 01:41:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we expected that.</v>

2157
01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you did that.</v>

2158
01:41:11.971 --> 01:41:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that that's a big factor</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his success in MMA period.</v>

2159
01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:16.473
<v Speaker 1>Grief is that his boxing was already a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really high level before you entered </v>

2160
01:41:19.811 --> 01:41:21.250
<v Speaker 1>into mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of,</v>

2161
01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I think even more than having boxing at </v>
<v Speaker 1>a high level.</v>

2162
01:41:23.981 --> 01:41:25.630
<v Speaker 1>It's just a rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2163
01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:26.890
<v Speaker 1>it's the rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>

2164
01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:30.970
<v Speaker 1>It's the experience in the fights more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than even being good or not like.</v>

2165
01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:35.350
<v Speaker 1>He was good obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he hadn't rounds so he wasn't coming</v>

2166
01:41:35.351 --> 01:41:38.180
<v Speaker 1>in green.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was coming in as a tenant,</v>

2167
01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.073
<v Speaker 1>as an amateur and then having 10 pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights and so that's 20 and l basically </v>

2168
01:41:43.391 --> 01:41:44.350
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2169
01:41:44.590 --> 01:41:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our tendency as a pro,</v>

2170
01:41:46.810 --> 01:41:50.410
<v Speaker 1>he lost some fights as an amateur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even then he goes through his losses</v>

2171
01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:51.633
<v Speaker 1>as an amateur so they don't affect him </v>
<v Speaker 1>on his record and so like he's learning </v>

2172
01:41:56.141 --> 01:41:56.974
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though your brain is taking the </v>

2173
01:41:58.511 --> 01:41:59.344
<v Speaker 1>damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he still learning things that are going </v>

2174
01:42:00.941 --> 01:42:04.150
<v Speaker 1>to be added to his pro career that gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>them experience in,</v>

2175
01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:06.460
<v Speaker 1>in the matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the amateur system,</v>

2176
01:42:06.461 --> 01:42:08.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amateur is going to create a,</v>

2177
01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:09.493
<v Speaker 1>a different level of up and comers now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not coming in as their </v>

2178
01:42:13.871 --> 01:42:14.704
<v Speaker 1>record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're coming in as two or three times </v>

2179
01:42:16.571 --> 01:42:17.404
<v Speaker 1>that record if you count there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always the thing that drives me </v>

2180
01:42:19.301 --> 01:42:21.830
<v Speaker 1>crazy about people that jump right into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC like you.</v>

2181
01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:23.013
<v Speaker 1>Not to pick on cm punk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that cm punk with no </v>

2182
01:42:25.841 --> 01:42:29.110
<v Speaker 1>competition experience whatsoever is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to fight professionally.</v>

2183
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:31.030
<v Speaker 1>In the biggest organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

2184
01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:33.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a little offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2185
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2186
01:42:34.690 --> 01:42:35.523
<v Speaker 1>Because here's a guy that has no </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition experience whatsoever and </v>

2187
01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:38.884
<v Speaker 1>he's going to fight someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimately and Micky Gall is a brown </v>

2188
01:42:41.351 --> 01:42:43.030
<v Speaker 1>belt in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good on the ground,</v>

2189
01:42:43.031 --> 01:42:44.470
<v Speaker 1>good standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough kid,</v>

2190
01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.640
<v Speaker 1>has fought amateur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has fought professional,</v>

2191
01:42:46.641 --> 01:42:49.150
<v Speaker 1>and has a wealth of martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

2192
01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:54.660
<v Speaker 1>It's contrary to everything anyone has </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever learned about learning and teaching</v>

2193
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:57.670
<v Speaker 1>and getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At martial arts,</v>

2194
01:42:57.850 --> 01:42:58.683
<v Speaker 1>you don't just jump into the deep end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pool when you're not some physical </v>

2195
01:43:01.181 --> 01:43:03.130
<v Speaker 1>freak like brock lesnar or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2196
01:43:03.131 --> 01:43:03.964
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a guy was a good </v>

2197
01:43:05.381 --> 01:43:06.940
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean cm punk is,</v>

2198
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:09.310
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing unbelievable about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2199
01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:13.270
<v Speaker 1>He's not some freak of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would think that if this guy really</v>

2200
01:43:13.271 --> 01:43:15.670
<v Speaker 1>did want to do this and do it the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2201
01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:19.450
<v Speaker 1>get them to go through it the right way </v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody else would.</v>

2202
01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Get them to start at small </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>

2203
01:43:21.461 --> 01:43:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Get Him to learn martial arts from </v>
<v Speaker 1>fault.</v>

2204
01:43:24.670 --> 01:43:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2205
01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:27.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

2206
01:43:27.370 --> 01:43:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Who's this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree.</v>

2207
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:29.343
<v Speaker 1>Who says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that cm punk is a genius for </v>

2208
01:43:32.351 --> 01:43:34.600
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can make a million dollars on this and</v>

2209
01:43:34.601 --> 01:43:35.890
<v Speaker 1>go fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody that would've made,</v>

2210
01:43:36.290 --> 01:43:38.370
<v Speaker 1>could have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have 50,000.</v>

2211
01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:43.540
<v Speaker 1>He'd never fought in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I paid $500 to 501st five fights.</v>

2212
01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my point.</v>

2213
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:46.750
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly the point I'm getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2214
01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was already famous.</v>

2215
01:43:48.370 --> 01:43:49.203
<v Speaker 1>That's what the fight was for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you think that it should be </v>

2216
01:43:52.491 --> 01:43:53.890
<v Speaker 1>approached that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2217
01:43:53.950 --> 01:43:54.783
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's going to keep </v>

2218
01:43:55.731 --> 01:43:56.990
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're.</v>

2219
01:43:56.991 --> 01:44:00.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what the UFC to an extent is </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting.</v>

2220
01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're promoting promotion,</v>

2221
01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:06.380
<v Speaker 1>not big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who deserves and not how good you are.</v>

2222
01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really look at what sells data,</v>

2223
01:44:09.861 --> 01:44:10.694
<v Speaker 1>5,000 and freaking Kimbo slice had </v>
<v Speaker 1>record sales on these weird things and </v>

2224
01:44:16.551 --> 01:44:18.350
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sense does that make?</v>

2225
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Is that fair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

2226
01:44:19.881 --> 01:44:21.110
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it selling?</v>

2227
01:44:21.111 --> 01:44:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't people buying it?</v>

2228
01:44:22.491 --> 01:44:23.324
<v Speaker 1>Because they understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wouldn't you think that once you're </v>

2229
01:44:25.131 --> 01:44:28.100
<v Speaker 1>already wealthy like cm punk is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's already a millionaire?</v>

2230
01:44:28.670 --> 01:44:29.503
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you want to do it correctly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather than go for the big cash grab </v>

2231
01:44:32.901 --> 01:44:33.734
<v Speaker 1>that's going to wind up getting your </v>
<v Speaker 1>face punched in like if he was your </v>

2232
01:44:36.201 --> 01:44:37.640
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's put it this way,</v>

2233
01:44:37.670 --> 01:44:39.590
<v Speaker 1>he raised my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what I tell them.</v>

2234
01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:40.623
<v Speaker 1>You've got to learn how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to learn how to fight the right </v>

2235
01:44:42.261 --> 01:44:43.094
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to learn how to fight like </v>

2236
01:44:43.461 --> 01:44:44.294
<v Speaker 1>everybody else does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slowly and surely you've got to train </v>

2237
01:44:46.851 --> 01:44:50.180
<v Speaker 1>with the best people in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from your ability up.</v>

2238
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't pretend you're already there.</v>

2239
01:44:52.610 --> 01:44:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Don't jump right into the UFC with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean face on that's fucking crazy.</v>

2240
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:57.103
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get smashed and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I respect you because you said that </v>

2241
01:44:59.091 --> 01:44:59.924
<v Speaker 1>to Brennan and shop and well Shaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was also an issue of him being a </v>

2242
01:45:03.561 --> 01:45:07.850
<v Speaker 1>very good friend of mine and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that to say to a friend,</v>

2243
01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:09.690
<v Speaker 1>you tell the friend the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just.</v>

2244
01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:10.573
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men and I knew how many times he'd been </v>

2245
01:45:11.451 --> 01:45:12.284
<v Speaker 1>knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew how many times he'd been knocked </v>

2246
01:45:13.351 --> 01:45:15.240
<v Speaker 1>down a football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew how many times I'd be in,</v>

2247
01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:16.093
<v Speaker 1>he had been knocked out in the gym and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew he was having issues and I knew he </v>

2248
01:45:18.741 --> 01:45:19.574
<v Speaker 1>wasn't able to take a punch like it used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to anymore and I also knew that he also </v>

2249
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:26.900
<v Speaker 1>had a way out with podcasting and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>being really successful in it.</v>

2250
01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:28.850
<v Speaker 1>And I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had a foot out the door.</v>

2251
01:45:28.851 --> 01:45:30.110
<v Speaker 1>He already had a foot out the door.</v>

2252
01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's you being a good friend.</v>

2253
01:45:32.031 --> 01:45:32.864
<v Speaker 1>So all I'm saying is it's proof that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say that you're following through </v>

2254
01:45:36.351 --> 01:45:37.184
<v Speaker 1>with what you know and that that's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would never stop cm punk from </v>

2255
01:45:39.441 --> 01:45:40.790
<v Speaker 1>competing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I would say is,</v>

2256
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:43.490
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a fucking Jujitsu match.</v>

2257
01:45:43.730 --> 01:45:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Have an amateur submission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling match.</v>

2258
01:45:46.190 --> 01:45:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Have an amateur kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do you think he did?</v>

2259
01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:49.933
<v Speaker 1>Because he got a fuck load of money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he thought he could do it </v>

2260
01:45:51.951 --> 01:45:54.530
<v Speaker 1>because he's a strong man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a strong mind.</v>

2261
01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:55.513
<v Speaker 1>He's like one of those straight edge </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that thinks he can just get a hard </v>

2262
01:45:58.221 --> 01:45:59.180
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pays off,</v>

2263
01:45:59.181 --> 01:46:00.014
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just went out there and he's a huge </v>

2264
01:46:01.341 --> 01:46:02.174
<v Speaker 1>celebrity and he felt like he was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to ride that to a new career in </v>

2265
01:46:04.551 --> 01:46:05.384
<v Speaker 1>the UFC and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like saying you're just going to </v>

2266
01:46:08.211 --> 01:46:11.330
<v Speaker 1>jump into Nascar and you've never raised</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car before.</v>

2267
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:14.480
<v Speaker 1>You're just going to wind up dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that being said,</v>

2268
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:15.343
<v Speaker 1>than the logic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only logical thing has to be the </v>

2269
01:46:17.331 --> 01:46:18.164
<v Speaker 1>money in that district.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent money bunny and </v>

2270
01:46:20.690 --> 01:46:22.910
<v Speaker 1>delusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delusional thinking.</v>

2271
01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:23.773
<v Speaker 1>What's the delusion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking that he's going to beat a guy </v>

2272
01:46:24.921 --> 01:46:27.560
<v Speaker 1>like micky gall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just delusional.</v>

2273
01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:30.650
<v Speaker 1>He think he really thought that the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can on it,</v>

2274
01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:32.840
<v Speaker 1>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

2275
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:35.330
<v Speaker 1>I think he thought he could beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he thought he could look,</v>

2276
01:46:35.331 --> 01:46:36.260
<v Speaker 1>use training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

2277
01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:37.113
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't training to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't trained to be 100 percent </v>

2278
01:46:38.931 --> 01:46:39.764
<v Speaker 1>defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stepped forward and throw a wild </v>

2279
01:46:41.511 --> 01:46:42.344
<v Speaker 1>right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't dance around the outside and </v>

2280
01:46:44.091 --> 01:46:46.160
<v Speaker 1>try to avoid him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tried to,</v>

2281
01:46:46.161 --> 01:46:49.190
<v Speaker 1>when he stepped towards him and got </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken down immediately,</v>

2282
01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:50.580
<v Speaker 1>then got mauled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2283
01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've seen him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2284
01:46:51.570 --> 01:46:54.150
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's like when a guy has </v>
<v Speaker 1>very little ground experience,</v>

2285
01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:56.220
<v Speaker 1>how long it takes before they accident.</v>

2286
01:46:56.820 --> 01:46:57.653
<v Speaker 1>I already knew that was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course knew it was going to happen </v>

2287
01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:00.733
<v Speaker 1>here soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you went to the ground you </v>

2288
01:47:01.501 --> 01:47:02.910
<v Speaker 1>knew exactly what was going to play out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2289
01:47:02.911 --> 01:47:03.744
<v Speaker 1>But you said it's almost offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember you saying that and it's </v>

2290
01:47:05.701 --> 01:47:06.620
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could,</v>

2291
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:07.583
<v Speaker 1>like who's who is who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it more offensive to us as the </v>

2292
01:47:11.131 --> 01:47:11.964
<v Speaker 1>fighters or is it a or is it like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I should be more mad at </v>

2293
01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:19.680
<v Speaker 1>at Mickey Golfer thinking he can do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's in every single one of us</v>

2294
01:47:19.681 --> 01:47:20.840
<v Speaker 1>to not make it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Me.</v>

2295
01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

2296
01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it up to.</v>

2297
01:47:24.090 --> 01:47:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Is it his fault that he believed that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could do it to an extent.</v>

2298
01:47:27.181 --> 01:47:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Does that make them that delusional that</v>
<v Speaker 1>every man on are things that they can go</v>

2299
01:47:30.361 --> 01:47:33.930
<v Speaker 1>in there and fight and win?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it the UFC that says,</v>

2300
01:47:34.110 --> 01:47:34.943
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll give you this much money and give </v>

<v Speaker 1>of it and how much money you can </v>

2302
01:47:41.461 --> 01:47:42.050
<v Speaker 1>generate?</v>

2303
01:47:42.050 --> 01:47:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great move for the UFC.</v>

2304
01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:45.360
<v Speaker 1>The UFC is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2305
01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:46.223
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got this huge superstar and we're </v>

2306
01:47:47.281 --> 01:47:48.114
<v Speaker 1>going to send them in with this fresh </v>
<v Speaker 1>faced young whipper who was a good </v>

2307
01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:53.130
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's got a really good mouth,</v>

2308
01:47:53.131 --> 01:47:55.890
<v Speaker 1>great at talking and he's gonna fuck him</v>
<v Speaker 1>up for sure.</v>

2309
01:47:56.210 --> 01:47:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Like this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do they do?</v>

2310
01:47:57.961 --> 01:47:58.794
<v Speaker 1>They made a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made a hero at a Mickey Golf and </v>

2311
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:03.690
<v Speaker 1>then wants to make he goggles Hazel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stave Sage Northcutt I think you fucking</v>

2312
01:48:03.691 --> 01:48:04.524
<v Speaker 1>corn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another one.</v>

2313
01:48:04.730 --> 01:48:07.920
<v Speaker 1>And then takes him out too and chokes </v>
<v Speaker 1>him out and his next fight,</v>

2314
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:11.010
<v Speaker 1>God damn genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's done is beautiful.</v>

2315
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:14.130
<v Speaker 1>So in a way the UFC has done a beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because they go,</v>

2316
01:48:14.131 --> 01:48:15.600
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you can fight in the UFC?</v>

2317
01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Come on in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a seat,</v>

2318
01:48:17.761 --> 01:48:19.650
<v Speaker 1>can we get you something to drink?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2319
01:48:19.710 --> 01:48:21.240
<v Speaker 1>come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that being said,</v>

2320
01:48:21.241 --> 01:48:22.074
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not offensive that cm punk when in </v>

2321
01:48:25.381 --> 01:48:26.214
<v Speaker 1>there did it.</v>

2322
01:48:26.370 --> 01:48:31.370
<v Speaker 1>It's offensive like I guess how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on who you are,</v>

2323
01:48:34.290 --> 01:48:35.123
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's not offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's crazy how you start to realize </v>

2324
01:48:38.701 --> 01:48:41.340
<v Speaker 1>in those scenarios that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter how much time,</v>

2325
01:48:41.341 --> 01:48:44.310
<v Speaker 1>skill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or purpose you put into this craft,</v>

2326
01:48:44.311 --> 01:48:47.280
<v Speaker 1>it matters how famous you are or else </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get paid in a way.</v>

2327
01:48:47.281 --> 01:48:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

2328
01:48:48.050 --> 01:48:50.820
<v Speaker 1>and this is my issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2329
01:48:51.330 --> 01:48:53.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not who's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's right,</v>

2330
01:48:53.791 --> 01:48:58.170
<v Speaker 1>it's you don't need to train and be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best anymore.</v>

2331
01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:02.550
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a tiny eensy weensy tiny little</v>

2332
01:49:02.551 --> 01:49:04.200
<v Speaker 1>bit of how you make money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

2333
01:49:04.201 --> 01:49:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is a factor and that factor</v>

2334
01:49:08.551 --> 01:49:10.710
<v Speaker 1>is compounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a great shit talker.</v>

2335
01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:11.813
<v Speaker 1>The point being conor Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conor mcgregor is not just a fantastic </v>

2336
01:49:15.631 --> 01:49:19.050
<v Speaker 1>shit talker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He acts a world class fighter fighting.</v>

2337

<v Speaker 1>bad motherfucker and he's capable of </v>

2338
01:49:21.201 --> 01:49:22.740
<v Speaker 1>knocking people out with one shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2339
01:49:22.741 --> 01:49:27.390
<v Speaker 1>that is something people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are so excited to see him.</v>

2340
01:49:27.391 --> 01:49:28.224
<v Speaker 1>They're paying money to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's different when we're talking about </v>

2341
01:49:31.321 --> 01:49:32.660
<v Speaker 1>somebody on a different level than </v>

<v Speaker 1>when she was beating all these women and</v>

2344
01:49:36.931 --> 01:49:39.960
<v Speaker 1>when she was just a flip and people in </v>

<v Speaker 3>that have this really comprehensive mma </v>

2360
01:50:20.231 --> 01:50:22.450
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas before she was fighting people.</v>

2361
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:25.510
<v Speaker 3>No disrespect to her opponents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were limited.</v>

2362
01:50:25.630 --> 01:50:27.040
<v Speaker 3>They were very limited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're striking.</v>

2363
01:50:27.041 --> 01:50:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it wasn't so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were awkward.</v>

2364
01:50:28.721 --> 01:50:31.090
<v Speaker 3>They weren't that good athletically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There weren't that strong.</v>

2365
01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:31.924
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't last as long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't touch her on the ground </v>

2366
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:36.330
<v Speaker 3>and she showed she shined in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>match.</v>

2367
01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:37.253
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's just odd how you can look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at somebody like paige vanzant and the </v>

2368
01:50:40.170 --> 01:50:42.150
<v Speaker 2>champ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a young Jay check.</v>

2369
01:50:42.570 --> 01:50:43.403
<v Speaker 2>Then the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2370
01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 slash 50.</v>

2371
01:50:45.010 --> 01:50:45.841
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

2372
01:50:45.841 --> 01:50:47.670
<v Speaker 2>It makes the most times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2373
01:50:48.450 --> 01:50:53.190
<v Speaker 2>that if you really look at the breakdown</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

2374
01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:54.053
<v Speaker 2>of the weight class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paige vanzant and the champ are almost </v>

2375
01:50:58.020 --> 01:51:00.300
<v Speaker 2>equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have equal value if you fight them to an</v>

2376
01:51:00.301 --> 01:51:02.970
<v Speaker 2>extent because of views and who wants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see who fight.</v>

2377
01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:03.893
<v Speaker 2>One was on dancing with the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>became a big household for dancing and </v>

2378
01:51:06.441 --> 01:51:11.340
<v Speaker 2>the dancing with the stars because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>before dancing with the stars.</v>

2379
01:51:11.341 --> 01:51:12.174
<v Speaker 2>She was already on dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like a fucking beautiful </v>

2380
01:51:13.381 --> 01:51:14.214
<v Speaker 2>cheerleader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that is the appeal that's </v>

2381
01:51:16.471 --> 01:51:18.730
<v Speaker 2>making money as my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just,</v>

2382
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:21.270
<v Speaker 2>she can fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She absolutely.</v>

2383
01:51:21.450 --> 01:51:23.520
<v Speaker 2>She's beating some great girls in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>division,</v>

2384
01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:26.250
<v Speaker 2>but if we're talking about young Jay </v>
<v Speaker 2>check who can fight,</v>

2385
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:27.960
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

2386
01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:30.150
<v Speaker 2>put her blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweat,</v>

2387
01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:33.720
<v Speaker 2>tears like you see it in her and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything about it,</v>

2388
01:51:33.930 --> 01:51:37.740
<v Speaker 2>and then paige vanzant who is a a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete and can fight.</v>

2389
01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:40.133
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The money levels that come to the same </v>

2390
01:51:41.791 --> 01:51:42.624
<v Speaker 2>because one is just that famous and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>a camera perfect compared to the other </v>

2391
01:51:48.091 --> 01:51:50.610
<v Speaker 2>one who was just that good at fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that she's not,</v>

2392
01:51:50.670 --> 01:51:52.500
<v Speaker 2>but she's not as good on the cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other one,</v>

2393
01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:53.473
<v Speaker 2>so it levels everything out and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's blowing my mind is watching that </v>

2394
01:51:56.821 --> 01:51:57.654
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though the skillset isn't even </v>

2395
01:51:58.561 --> 01:52:00.180
<v Speaker 2>close to the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to make the same money.</v>

2396
01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:01.313
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the really scary thing is when the page </v>

2397
01:52:03.751 --> 01:52:06.570
<v Speaker 2>might make more money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's crazy.</v>

2398
01:52:06.571 --> 01:52:08.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what's trippy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is kind of trippy,</v>

2399
01:52:08.730 --> 01:52:11.970
<v Speaker 2>but it kind of makes sense because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment as well as fighting.</v>

2400
01:52:11.971 --> 01:52:12.804
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just who's the best sprinter </v>

2401
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:17.200
<v Speaker 2>and that's where I go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't offend you with.</v>

2402
01:52:17.970 --> 01:52:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't offend me in that sense.</v>

2403
01:52:20.370 --> 01:52:22.380
<v Speaker 2>What offended me was that he,</v>

2404
01:52:22.610 --> 01:52:23.443
<v Speaker 3>it didn't offend me that he thought it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I felt like someone should have </v>

2405
01:52:25.931 --> 01:52:26.764
<v Speaker 3>told them and it didn't offend me that </v>
<v Speaker 3>his coach has prepared them for it </v>

2406
01:52:28.961 --> 01:52:30.160
<v Speaker 3>because his coach is a good friend of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mine,</v>

2407
01:52:30.161 --> 01:52:32.140
<v Speaker 3>Duke Roufus and what are you going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>

2408
01:52:32.141 --> 01:52:33.640
<v Speaker 3>The guy comes through and wants to learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to fight.</v>

2409
01:52:34.130 --> 01:52:35.050
<v Speaker 3>You got to throw them in there.</v>

2410
01:52:35.070 --> 01:52:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just itch.</v>

2411
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:42.060
<v Speaker 2>It should happen the way it happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's good for everybody to see.</v>

2412
01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:45.560
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't happen the way it happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's all we were going to see.</v>

2413
01:52:46.610 --> 01:52:47.680
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>

2414
01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:49.340
<v Speaker 1>It was a mauling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember?</v>

2415
01:52:49.341 --> 01:52:53.180
<v Speaker 1>That was Mike Tyson fights where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would fight guys and you would just go,</v>

2416
01:52:53.181 --> 01:52:56.000
<v Speaker 1>don't blink because this shit is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to last.</v>

2417
01:52:56.210 --> 01:52:57.680
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2418
01:52:57.681 --> 01:52:59.240
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a competition,</v>

2419
01:52:59.241 --> 01:53:01.310
<v Speaker 1>but God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really,</v>

2420
01:53:01.670 --> 01:53:03.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like paige vanzant.</v>

2421
01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to her again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's a very talented girl.</v>

2422
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:08.980
<v Speaker 1>I've got nothing but respect for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was really fun.</v>

2423
01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:10.653
<v Speaker 1>It scared the fuck out of me when she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was getting close to your Nana when she </v>

2424
01:53:13.221 --> 01:53:14.054
<v Speaker 1>was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when she was winning fights and </v>

2425
01:53:15.141 --> 01:53:18.320
<v Speaker 1>then she fought rose noma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eunice and eunice is like right there.</v>

2426
01:53:18.321 --> 01:53:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosana,</v>

2427
01:53:19.190 --> 01:53:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Eunice lost to Carolina Kovacevich </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a very close fight.</v>

2428
01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Karolina went on to have a very close </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight with you on a right.</v>

2429
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:30.800
<v Speaker 1>So rose beats paige vanzant decidedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2430
01:53:30.801 --> 01:53:33.260
<v Speaker 1>She beat her down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a huge performance for her,</v>

2431
01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:38.740
<v Speaker 1>but that meant that page was literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>two steps away from a murderer.</v>

2432
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:40.783
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll wanna look what she did to </v>

2433
01:53:41.661 --> 01:53:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Jessica Panay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2434
01:53:42.561 --> 01:53:43.394
<v Speaker 1>I was just to say that's my home girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she trades with us at Alliance and </v>

2435
01:53:46.761 --> 01:53:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Jessica is no Slouch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no slouch,</v>

2436
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:50.420
<v Speaker 1>just she's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

2437
01:53:50.421 --> 01:53:52.490
<v Speaker 1>She's not just like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she took it.</v>

2438
01:53:52.810 --> 01:53:53.541
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2439
01:53:53.541 --> 01:53:56.360
<v Speaker 1>she's a tough girl and all these girls </v>
<v Speaker 1>are tough.</v>

2440
01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:58.550
<v Speaker 1>But when you.</v>

2441
01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:00.053
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a little off when the girls came </v>

2442
01:54:01.741 --> 01:54:03.030
<v Speaker 2>in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in alliance.</v>

2443
01:54:03.031 --> 01:54:05.250
<v Speaker 2>We never had women in the gym ever in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole career.</v>

2444
01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:06.840
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>

2445
01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:09.840
<v Speaker 2>it was just like no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women were fighting,</v>

2446
01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:11.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for years.</v>

2447
01:54:11.761 --> 01:54:13.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did the women start coming there?</v>

2448
01:54:14.610 --> 01:54:16.500
<v Speaker 2>It's been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had been with us like two,</v>

2449
01:54:16.510 --> 01:54:17.343
<v Speaker 2>three years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say maybe if that with our </v>

2450
01:54:21.361 --> 01:54:22.350
<v Speaker 2>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Eric,</v>

2451
01:54:23.130 --> 01:54:25.500
<v Speaker 2>but when they first came I was a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>off put,</v>

2452
01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:27.930
<v Speaker 2>but the longer they are around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more they're like,</v>

2453
01:54:27.931 --> 01:54:30.810
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so in the sport.</v>

2454
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:32.550
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2455
01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:34.470
<v Speaker 2>their eyes are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2456
01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.630
<v Speaker 2>like sponges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best way I could put it.</v>

2457
01:54:36.631 --> 01:54:40.770
<v Speaker 2>And they're just so hungry to hear and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not just listening.</v>

2458
01:54:40.771 --> 01:54:41.604
<v Speaker 2>They're hearing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the biggest difference I noticed </v>

2459
01:54:43.561 --> 01:54:47.730
<v Speaker 2>with the women compared to trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work with men is men don't they listen,</v>

2460
01:54:47.731 --> 01:54:48.540
<v Speaker 2>but they're not hearing you.</v>

2461
01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:51.090
<v Speaker 2>They already have their own vision of </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2462
01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:51.953
<v Speaker 2>cm punk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go out there and hit him </v>

2463
01:54:52.771 --> 01:54:54.030
<v Speaker 2>with a right hand and that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

2464
01:54:54.031 --> 01:54:59.031
<v Speaker 2>He had that vision and no matter what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you told cm punk that it wasn't going to</v>

2465
01:54:59.071 --> 01:55:02.730
<v Speaker 2>go that way because you were a 50 time </v>
<v Speaker 2>world champion and you know what's going</v>

2466
01:55:02.731 --> 01:55:03.480
<v Speaker 2>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2467
01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.340
<v Speaker 2>he had that vision and that was at </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

2468
01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:06.533
<v Speaker 2>You can tell them how it's gonna happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they trust and they listen and they </v>

2469
01:55:10.890 --> 01:55:11.723
<v Speaker 2>are open and they're willing and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have that and you're teaching </v>

2470
01:55:15.931 --> 01:55:18.930
<v Speaker 2>somebody something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when you can watch.</v>

2471
01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:19.793
<v Speaker 2>Watch this thing grow and that's a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing with the women that I really have </v>

2472
01:55:23.191 --> 01:55:24.024
<v Speaker 2>learned being around them is they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just so humble in knowing where they're </v>

2473
01:55:29.581 --> 01:55:31.050
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a fight here.</v>

2474
01:55:31.051 --> 01:55:32.760
<v Speaker 2>I need to listen and things could go </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

2475
01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:34.620
<v Speaker 2>Whereas men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like</v>

2476
01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.440
<v Speaker 1>built to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is me.</v>

2477
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:38.870
<v Speaker 1>This is how I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a man.</v>

2478
01:55:39.150 --> 01:55:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm the man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could kill anybody on earth.</v>

2479
01:55:41.271 --> 01:55:44.190
<v Speaker 1>We're all wired that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ego is that in some</v>

2480
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:47.790
<v Speaker 2>ways connected to your learning to let </v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

2481
01:55:48.110 --> 01:55:48.943
<v Speaker 2>It's 100 percent my biggest battle and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't mention it because I'm still </v>

2482
01:55:53.131 --> 01:55:53.964
<v Speaker 2>learning so much about it that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to sound too off with my </v>

2483
01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:59.460
<v Speaker 2>description because I'm not a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

2484
01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:02.730
<v Speaker 2>I haven't completely rover it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2485
01:56:02.731 --> 01:56:05.010
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't mastered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a hard thing to master,</v>

2486
01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:06.533
<v Speaker 2>but when you can let go of the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ego is just such a horrible thing </v>

2487
01:56:10.591 --> 01:56:11.424
<v Speaker 2>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

2488
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:12.623
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it ruined so many things that we could </v>

2489
01:56:14.731 --> 01:56:15.564
<v Speaker 2>be free from my ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't allow me to make me think that </v>

2490
01:56:19.621 --> 01:56:24.621
<v Speaker 2>I'm above you and that you should have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>two espressos here for me because I'm me</v>

2491
01:56:25.141 --> 01:56:25.974
<v Speaker 2>and I should have my water at 80 degrees</v>
<v Speaker 2>and somebody should be giving me a </v>

2492
01:56:29.221 --> 01:56:30.054
<v Speaker 2>massage and then we get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have my own car pick me up and </v>

2493
01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:36.360
<v Speaker 2>if I have my own car pick picking me up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know some somebody should be.</v>

2494
01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:37.193
<v Speaker 2>But that's only because I put myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>above things and the only reason I put </v>

2495
01:56:39.901 --> 01:56:40.734
<v Speaker 2>myself about things because my ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only reason I make excuses is </v>

2496
01:56:43.331 --> 01:56:47.940
<v Speaker 2>because my ego forces me to hide what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>am rather than what happened.</v>

2497
01:56:48.510 --> 01:56:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Ego just demolished is everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the sport of fighting.</v>

2498
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:54.000
<v Speaker 2>When you can set your ego aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear it all the time,</v>

2499
01:56:54.001 --> 01:56:55.530
<v Speaker 2>leave your ego at the door and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>come.</v>

2500
01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:56.373
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very rare do people leave their ego at </v>

2501
01:56:58.951 --> 01:56:59.784
<v Speaker 2>the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're keeping track of every </v>

2502
01:57:00.241 --> 01:57:02.430
<v Speaker 2>submission that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every takedown,</v>

2503
01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:03.533
<v Speaker 2>every punch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fixing their shin guards in the </v>

2504
01:57:05.911 --> 01:57:06.744
<v Speaker 2>middle of the practice because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting tired and they don't want that </v>

2505
01:57:08.731 --> 01:57:09.564
<v Speaker 2>one big kick to land where that one big </v>
<v Speaker 2>take down the line when they're tired </v>

2506
01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:15.330
<v Speaker 2>and then it hurts their brain because </v>
<v Speaker 2>their psychology needs to stop.</v>

2507
01:57:15.331 --> 01:57:16.164
<v Speaker 2>I'll take downs in order for their ego </v>
<v Speaker 2>not to be hurt if it goes on and on and </v>

2508
01:57:20.611 --> 01:57:21.270
<v Speaker 2>on and on.</v>

2509
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:22.103
<v Speaker 2>And Ego is the biggest thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed is the difference with men and </v>

2510
01:57:24.811 --> 01:57:25.650
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

2511
01:57:25.651 --> 01:57:29.490
<v Speaker 2>Women have it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a different feel.</v>

2512
01:57:29.491 --> 01:57:30.150
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2513
01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:32.550
<v Speaker 2>when we got women in the room and men in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the room and how they,</v>

2514
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:34.103
<v Speaker 2>the energies is just interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that women are better at </v>

2515
01:57:37.801 --> 01:57:42.510
<v Speaker 2>taking instruction from men and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>not as good as taking it from women?</v>

2516
01:57:42.511 --> 01:57:43.344
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that what's going on is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the women are conceding that these </v>

2517
01:57:47.281 --> 01:57:48.114
<v Speaker 2>men are bigger and stronger and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience and so it's easier for them </v>

2518
01:57:50.881 --> 01:57:51.714
<v Speaker 2>to do a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe they still have that ego </v>

2519
01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:54.780
<v Speaker 2>against other women?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2520
01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:55.913
<v Speaker 2>I mean you pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believed that that is pretty </v>

2521
01:57:57.991 --> 01:57:58.824
<v Speaker 2>much exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there is a now it doesn't always </v>

2522
01:58:00.541 --> 01:58:01.374
<v Speaker 2>go this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a natural flow in the way </v>

2523
01:58:03.361 --> 01:58:05.010
<v Speaker 2>we're built as human beings.</v>

2524
01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To where in the past where you know,</v>

2525
01:58:09.121 --> 01:58:11.390
<v Speaker 2>the man is the leader of the household </v>
<v Speaker 2>data da Da da.</v>

2526
01:58:11.550 --> 01:58:14.580
<v Speaker 2>That was the old way of thinking and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're getting contemporary and it's like</v>

2527
01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:19.640
<v Speaker 2>everybody is equal and as that's come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pass,</v>

2528
01:58:19.741 --> 01:58:22.590
<v Speaker 2>we've seen women be the biggest hit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world for fighting right now.</v>

2529
01:58:22.591 --> 01:58:23.424
<v Speaker 2>Like their main carding everything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're running stuff and I think that </v>

2530
01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:30.780
<v Speaker 2>that has become so many years in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past where you're like,</v>

2531
01:58:30.781 --> 01:58:32.070
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men are the household.</v>

2532
01:58:32.071 --> 01:58:34.980
<v Speaker 2>They run everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The women had to put their ego aside for</v>

2533
01:58:34.981 --> 01:58:39.060
<v Speaker 2>so long that they learn how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had no ego walking into things.</v>

2534
01:58:39.061 --> 01:58:39.894
<v Speaker 2>They just already assumed the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it made them so much more open </v>

2535
01:58:43.721 --> 01:58:45.220
<v Speaker 2>that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take instruction.</v>

2536
01:58:45.221 --> 01:58:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I swear they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just different with women.</v>

2537
01:58:48.010 --> 01:58:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just odd.</v>

2538
01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:54.220
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be in it to really feel it,</v>

2539
01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:58.090
<v Speaker 2>that women just take instruction </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently in a fight scenario.</v>

2540
01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not what everybody.</v>

2541
01:59:00.131 --> 01:59:03.070
<v Speaker 2>I think that if you're dating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter or something and you try to help</v>

2542
01:59:03.071 --> 01:59:03.710
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2543
01:59:03.710 --> 01:59:06.430
<v Speaker 2>it's actually never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that.</v>

2544
01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:09.190
<v Speaker 2>So it goes both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it,</v>

2545
01:59:09.630 --> 01:59:10.463
<v Speaker 2>but I've rarely do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see two lovers coach together and </v>

2546
01:59:15.011 --> 01:59:16.600
<v Speaker 2>train together and do fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2547
01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:19.620
<v Speaker 2>The only odd one that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've seen work is smiling.</v>

2548
01:59:19.810 --> 01:59:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Misha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Misha,</v>

2549
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Misha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's another one.</v>

2550
01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:24.400
<v Speaker 2>What will you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say a smiley?</v>

2551
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Who smile he just fought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got,</v>

2552
01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:30.460
<v Speaker 2>always got this smiling on the back of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his head.</v>

2553
01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:32.500
<v Speaker 2>A redhead,</v>

2554
01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:33.693
<v Speaker 1>smiling Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hobbies and LV has girls in his corner </v>

2555
01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:38.920
<v Speaker 1>was every time you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2556
01:59:38.921 --> 01:59:40.030
<v Speaker 1>And Him and his girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got,</v>

2557
01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:42.340
<v Speaker 1>he was walking into the last fight with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his kids,</v>

2558
01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:45.490
<v Speaker 1>with him and his girl and he's kissing </v>
<v Speaker 1>her while he's laughing at the end.</v>

2559
01:59:45.491 --> 01:59:46.324
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it blows my mind because everybody has </v>

2560
01:59:47.501 --> 01:59:49.030
<v Speaker 1>their own system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2561
01:59:49.031 --> 01:59:49.864
<v Speaker 1>and he's a happy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems like he's having a grand old </v>

2562
01:59:51.881 --> 01:59:55.630
<v Speaker 1>time de who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2563
01:59:56.560 --> 01:59:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

2564
01:59:57.971 --> 01:59:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Well Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2565
01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:00.520
<v Speaker 1>that's the weird thing about people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2566
02:00:00.521 --> 02:00:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's got a whole different </v>
<v Speaker 1>formula.</v>

2567
02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:05.410
<v Speaker 1>It just the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these topics are interesting.</v>

2568
02:00:05.770 --> 02:00:06.603
<v Speaker 1>So we're pretty much running out of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've got to head back to San </v>

2569
02:00:09.670 --> 02:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Diego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to get back to where you're</v>

2570
02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>at now as far as recovery and what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts are about resting and getting,</v>

2571
02:00:17.651 --> 02:00:18.700
<v Speaker 1>getting back to camp.</v>

2572
02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:21.850
<v Speaker 1>And when do you think your feet are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be re raring to go again?</v>

2573
02:00:21.851 --> 02:00:24.550
<v Speaker 1>And all your injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much that year.</v>

2574
02:00:24.551 --> 02:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Just put a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good a bra on my body.</v>

2575
02:00:26.981 --> 02:00:30.760
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just right now I'm just healing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then those two are going to fight.</v>

2576
02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think July.</v>

2577
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's still a July fourth card.</v>

2578
02:00:34.871 --> 02:00:35.704
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The July weekend or say I don't really </v>

2579
02:00:38.201 --> 02:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know the exact date.</v>

2580
02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:40.683
<v Speaker 1>That's the big weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That July fourth weekend is always a </v>

2581
02:00:43.001 --> 02:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>huge weekend for the UFC and I</v>

2582
02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:45.870
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2583
02:00:46.930 --> 02:00:49.650
<v Speaker 2>those to a fight on that card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'd like to winter that.</v>

2584
02:00:49.651 --> 02:00:50.484
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to come back and fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight for the belt and put on another </v>

2585
02:00:53.161 --> 02:00:53.791
<v Speaker 2>good show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2586
02:00:53.791 --> 02:00:57.510
<v Speaker 2>regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that show was great and you know,</v>

2587
02:00:58.230 --> 02:01:00.360
<v Speaker 2>just to touch on that fight one more </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2588
02:01:00.361 --> 02:01:02.670
<v Speaker 2>What was going through my head that </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed things?</v>

2589
02:01:02.671 --> 02:01:04.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear a lot about what people,</v>

2590
02:01:04.741 --> 02:01:06.210
<v Speaker 2>all he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't look the same.</v>

2591
02:01:06.211 --> 02:01:06.751
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2592
02:01:06.751 --> 02:01:07.584
<v Speaker 2>he that and it's like there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I want to clarify that </v>

2593
02:01:10.710 --> 02:01:13.560
<v Speaker 2>unless you're a professional fighter and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in that zone,</v>

2594
02:01:13.561 --> 02:01:15.540
<v Speaker 2>you don't really understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the,</v>

2595
02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:16.433
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that I approached the fight was </v>

2596
02:01:19.291 --> 02:01:21.390
<v Speaker 2>a little different in this one than </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen in the past.</v>

2597
02:01:21.870 --> 02:01:24.360
<v Speaker 2>For the first two rounds it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty good.</v>

2598
02:01:24.361 --> 02:01:26.430
<v Speaker 2>It was back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and me and cody was,</v>

2599
02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:27.293
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a competitive match up coming </v>

2600
02:01:29.161 --> 02:01:29.610
<v Speaker 2>into third.</v>

2601
02:01:29.610 --> 02:01:32.250
<v Speaker 2>I get cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you get what he did,</v>

2602
02:01:32.251 --> 02:01:34.830
<v Speaker 2>he hit you with a kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a kick or a headbutt.</v>

2603
02:01:34.831 --> 02:01:35.490
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2604
02:01:35.490 --> 02:01:37.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

2605
02:01:37.531 --> 02:01:40.490
<v Speaker 2>We're going to say it was a kid who </v>
<v Speaker 2>cares about kick got me,</v>

2606
02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:41.613
<v Speaker 2>caught me right here in my eyebrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember I got cut and I remember </v>

2607
02:01:45.090 --> 02:01:45.923
<v Speaker 2>it started bleeding and it wasn't the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood that bothered me as much as know </v>

2608
02:01:49.490 --> 02:01:51.890
<v Speaker 2>as the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when,</v>

2609
02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:53.233
<v Speaker 2>if you're me and you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think about everything that's </v>

2610
02:01:55.731 --> 02:01:57.440
<v Speaker 2>going on and I'm adjusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2611
02:01:57.441 --> 02:01:58.460
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the doctors in here,</v>

2612
02:01:58.461 --> 02:01:59.850
<v Speaker 2>this cut is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2613
02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:01.820
<v Speaker 2>and the way they were talking to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you okay?</v>

2614
02:02:01.821 --> 02:02:02.750
<v Speaker 2>How's it look?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2615
02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:03.613
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to stop this fight like </v>

2616
02:02:04.731 --> 02:02:08.300
<v Speaker 2>this ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I heard the cow crowd reaction,</v>

2617
02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when they saw,</v>

2618
02:02:10.221 --> 02:02:11.900
<v Speaker 2>when they showed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2619
02:02:11.901 --> 02:02:13.370
<v Speaker 2>crap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might stop this fight.</v>

2620
02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:14.233
<v Speaker 2>So this is the third round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to go after it for the in the </v>

2621
02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:20.210
<v Speaker 2>fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's no other,</v>

2622
02:02:20.570 --> 02:02:22.880
<v Speaker 2>it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no longer fighting smart.</v>

2623
02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:24.980
<v Speaker 2>It's no longer fighting smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After I got cut,</v>

2624
02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:27.440
<v Speaker 2>the third round is lost for me right </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get cut,</v>

2625
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:28.363
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chances of me winning that or I have to </v>

2626
02:02:29.541 --> 02:02:33.560
<v Speaker 2>drop them or take them down and hold </v>
<v Speaker 2>them down and then maybe I could win.</v>

2627
02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:35.001
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2628
02:02:35.001 --> 02:02:38.720
<v Speaker 2>the cut is a deciding factor as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete that you have to make a choice.</v>

2629
02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:39.673
<v Speaker 2>Am I all in or am I going to play safe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was all in once I got cut because </v>

2630
02:02:42.921 --> 02:02:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I already lost on the score cards in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

2631
02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Once you get cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're down on,</v>

2632
02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:48.800
<v Speaker 2>on the bleeding and the damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to see that.</v>

2633
02:02:48.801 --> 02:02:49.634
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not either cut him or put them out </v>

2634
02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:53.270
<v Speaker 2>or keep them down on the mat.</v>

2635
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:55.310
<v Speaker 2>That was the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From then on,</v>

2636
02:02:55.311 --> 02:02:58.070
<v Speaker 2>after that cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was no longer stick move,</v>

2637
02:02:58.430 --> 02:03:00.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the weak side.</v>

2638
02:03:00.081 --> 02:03:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Go to the strong side time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This time that it's,</v>

2639
02:03:03.630 --> 02:03:06.110
<v Speaker 2>you got to kill this dude or else you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna lose a decision.</v>

2640
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:07.363
<v Speaker 2>That's it and that's why you saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>different me in the fourth and that's </v>

2641
02:03:12.471 --> 02:03:13.304
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the big mistake wasn't me </v>

2642
02:03:14.421 --> 02:03:17.150
<v Speaker 2>getting put down on my butt a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>times in one round and getting a 10,</v>

2643
02:03:17.151 --> 02:03:20.420
<v Speaker 2>eight round and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at that point with the cut,</v>

2644
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:21.283
<v Speaker 2>let's say I take it safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say I get cut and I play it safe </v>

2645
02:03:23.541 --> 02:03:27.650
<v Speaker 2>like I had been doing the chances that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the doctor would stop it were high,</v>

2646
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:31.070
<v Speaker 2>he could go play it safe so it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut my eye open worse,</v>

2647
02:03:31.071 --> 02:03:32.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stick move.</v>

2648
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Just stay safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2649
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:36.320
<v Speaker 2>it's like to just go for it.</v>

2650
02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm all in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the fight.</v>

2651
02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:38.773
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was feeling at that time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what can't be read on the </v>

2652
02:03:41.721 --> 02:03:42.554
<v Speaker 2>outside of a fight is what a fighter's </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling when I'm feeling is they might </v>

2653
02:03:45.801 --> 02:03:48.500
<v Speaker 2>stop this fight because of this cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you either got to take them out,</v>

2654
02:03:48.770 --> 02:03:49.603
<v Speaker 2>take them down or cut him back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was the focus and when that </v>

2655
02:03:53.031 --> 02:03:53.864
<v Speaker 2>happened I went all in and then that </v>
<v Speaker 2>created the openings that he needed to </v>

2656
02:03:56.901 --> 02:04:00.080
<v Speaker 2>be successful in his game plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was it.</v>

2657
02:04:00.081 --> 02:04:03.050
<v Speaker 2>So fifth round I knew I had to take them</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2658
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:04.183
<v Speaker 2>I mean I won the fifth round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wins the fifth round after losing </v>

2659
02:04:06.620 --> 02:04:08.720
<v Speaker 2>after getting put on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a couple of times,</v>

2660
02:04:08.721 --> 02:04:09.554
<v Speaker 2>not very many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a matter of that fight can go </v>

2661
02:04:12.741 --> 02:04:15.020
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the tools,</v>

2662
02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:17.210
<v Speaker 2>the skillset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cardio,</v>

2663
02:04:17.211 --> 02:04:19.100
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a little bit of health,</v>

2664
02:04:19.730 --> 02:04:22.910
<v Speaker 2>some adjustments and everything's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a game of inches.</v>

2665
02:04:22.911 --> 02:04:24.530
<v Speaker 2>So that's how I feel about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2666
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm not discouraged by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As much as I feel like I'm growing,</v>

2667
02:04:29.150 --> 02:04:31.400
<v Speaker 2>I can grow from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also a massive challenge.</v>

2668
02:04:31.401 --> 02:04:34.460
<v Speaker 2>Now that you know that you've faced a </v>
<v Speaker 2>god that can beat you like that.</v>

2669
02:04:34.461 --> 02:04:37.840
<v Speaker 2>And now that massive challenge will </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly burn a fire inside of you.</v>

2670
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:39.113
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't need that to burn a fire </v>

2671
02:04:40.451 --> 02:04:41.284
<v Speaker 2>inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think it gives you more </v>

2672
02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:45.010
<v Speaker 2>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If losing makes you.</v>

2673
02:04:45.460 --> 02:04:46.293
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if losing changes to how you approach </v>

2674
02:04:49.001 --> 02:04:50.920
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it weighs more than winning.</v>

2675
02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2676
02:04:52.601 --> 02:04:54.130
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying and I said that</v>

2677
02:04:54.150 --> 02:04:56.020
<v Speaker 2>they should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2678
02:04:57.090 --> 02:04:59.140
<v Speaker 2>You got to be who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Winning and losing.</v>

2679
02:04:59.141 --> 02:04:59.974
<v Speaker 2>You can't let that decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if I don't have the drive to go win </v>

2680
02:05:02.891 --> 02:05:05.260
<v Speaker 2>a world title without winning or losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what am I doing?</v>

2681
02:05:05.410 --> 02:05:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's not the right way to think and</v>

2682
02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:09.680
<v Speaker 2>part of your new mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2683
02:05:09.690 --> 02:05:10.750
<v Speaker 2>this is life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2684
02:05:10.751 --> 02:05:13.720
<v Speaker 2>But this is a part of your new mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New that I've always had this.</v>

2685
02:05:13.900 --> 02:05:15.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gotten.</v>

2686
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten better at accepting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2687
02:05:18.370 --> 02:05:20.560
<v Speaker 2>With,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with losing control of things that I can</v>

2688
02:05:20.561 --> 02:05:20.920
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

2689
02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've always thought that way can't.</v>

2690
02:05:24.370 --> 02:05:25.203
<v Speaker 2>How do I make it so winning and losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>are equal because I don't want it to </v>

2691
02:05:27.041 --> 02:05:28.180
<v Speaker 2>change me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if I lose,</v>

2692
02:05:28.181 --> 02:05:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I need to still be the person that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell everybody I am winning and losing.</v>

2693
02:05:31.721 --> 02:05:32.554
<v Speaker 2>You have to be what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't change because it didn't go </v>

2694
02:05:34.361 --> 02:05:35.194
<v Speaker 2>your way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think I need that last to be </v>

2695
02:05:38.531 --> 02:05:39.364
<v Speaker 2>driven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was driven and thought I was going to </v>

2696
02:05:40.751 --> 02:05:42.820
<v Speaker 2>win that fight as much as ever before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fight.</v>

2697
02:05:43.090 --> 02:05:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm as driven and as good as I always </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

2698
02:05:45.791 --> 02:05:46.624
<v Speaker 2>Now after the loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a matter of making </v>

2699
02:05:48.851 --> 02:05:51.310
<v Speaker 2>adjustments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not burning desire,</v>

2700
02:05:51.330 --> 02:05:54.220
<v Speaker 2>just another challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not burning desire to burning desire.</v>

2701
02:05:54.221 --> 02:05:57.520
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have that in all times and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get out because you're gonna get hurt.</v>

2702
02:05:58.140 --> 02:05:58.973
<v Speaker 3>So how much time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we're talking with them fighting </v>

2703
02:06:02.011 --> 02:06:03.450
<v Speaker 3>in July,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking right now.</v>

2704
02:06:03.451 --> 02:06:04.284
<v Speaker 3>It is now February.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if they fight in July then you're </v>

2705
02:06:07.021 --> 02:06:08.880
<v Speaker 3>likely looking at somewhere around </v>
<v Speaker 3>December,</v>

2706
02:06:08.910 --> 02:06:09.420
<v Speaker 3>somewhere like that.</v>

2707
02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:13.230
<v Speaker 2>That perhaps depending on if I do one </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight this year,</v>

2708
02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:15.090
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Go back and live my title.</v>

2709
02:06:15.091 --> 02:06:15.924
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then defended and another three </v>

2710
02:06:16.771 --> 02:06:18.570
<v Speaker 2>times in one year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2711
02:06:18.930 --> 02:06:19.800
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2712
02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:23.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean these guys are going to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a winner.</v>

2713
02:06:23.971 --> 02:06:27.780
<v Speaker 2>People want to see me fight them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that one of these guys.</v>

2714
02:06:27.781 --> 02:06:28.614
<v Speaker 2>So what am I in a rush for other than </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting healthy and healing and putting </v>

2715
02:06:31.951 --> 02:06:34.170
<v Speaker 2>on a good show and fight these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to fight me.</v>

2716
02:06:34.171 --> 02:06:35.850
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of them.</v>

2717
02:06:36.260 --> 02:06:37.093
<v Speaker 2>So what's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the rest other than being </v>

2718
02:06:39.811 --> 02:06:41.670
<v Speaker 2>perfectly healthy so I can put that show</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2719
02:06:42.150 --> 02:06:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I fought three times last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cody sat on the outside,</v>

2720
02:06:44.791 --> 02:06:46.740
<v Speaker 2>fought at three round fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came in and fought me.</v>

2721
02:06:47.070 --> 02:06:47.903
<v Speaker 2>I fought three titles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought for three titles against the </v>

2722
02:06:49.771 --> 02:06:50.604
<v Speaker 2>best guys in the world.</v>

2723
02:06:50.780 --> 02:06:51.613
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see how he can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if he can keep a wind street </v>

2724
02:06:55.771 --> 02:06:57.930
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if he can keep the belt at all</v>

2725
02:06:58.140 --> 02:07:01.020
<v Speaker 2>against the guy that I already fought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let's see if Tj,</v>

2726
02:07:01.050 --> 02:07:03.240
<v Speaker 2>what Tj can do with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this opportunity.</v>

2727
02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:06.480
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind seeing what these gentlemen</v>

2728
02:07:06.481 --> 02:07:07.314
<v Speaker 2>can do with it because I fought them </v>
<v Speaker 2>both and I know what it takes to be the </v>

2729
02:07:10.381 --> 02:07:11.214
<v Speaker 2>best for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just for one fight and I'm not sure </v>

2730
02:07:15.211 --> 02:07:16.044
<v Speaker 2>if they have what it takes yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm here and I liked the challenge </v>

2731
02:07:18.781 --> 02:07:21.300
<v Speaker 2>to find out and I like to challenge them</v>
<v Speaker 2>again to find out.</v>
