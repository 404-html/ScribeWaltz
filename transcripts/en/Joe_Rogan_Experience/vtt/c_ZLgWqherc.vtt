00:03:45.111 --> 00:03:46.740
<v Speaker 2>so just in case you can visualize it.</v>

152
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.210
<v Speaker 2>And they said to him,</v>

153
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.520
<v Speaker 2>what would you do with James Thompson won?</v>

154
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.240
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

155
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.140
<v Speaker 2>I'd hung myself.</v>

156
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.513
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

157
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

158
00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.300
<v Speaker 1>that's the dumbest motherfucker in the history of MMA productions.</v>

159
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

160
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.760
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you have one guy that's the most important thing and bank</v>

161
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.400
<v Speaker 1>everything on him winning so stupid.</v>

162
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

163
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.080
<v Speaker 1>eggs.</v>

164
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Culturally domino.</v>

165
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Because if you kicked that guy's ass,</v>

166
00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:14.130
<v Speaker 1>it would have been awesome.</v>

167
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.400
<v Speaker 1>If they left you in side control would have been awesome.</v>

168
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Just like it was awesome for him when he won.</v>

169
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.720
<v Speaker 1>It would have been awesome for you then.</v>

170
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

171
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.400
<v Speaker 1>you got to let the guy who's supposed to win win when you're trying to just be</v>

172
00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:27.540
<v Speaker 1>the most marketable.</v>

173
00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:29.550
<v Speaker 1>You're like looking for the most marketable guy.</v>

174
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.990
<v Speaker 1>You'd never going to have a legit organization organization.</v>

175
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.500
<v Speaker 1>This whole organization was,</v>

176
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.510
<v Speaker 1>it was essentially a corrupt organization.</v>

177
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.260
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

178
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.190
<v Speaker 1>that's what that is.</v>

179
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.443
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

180
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing a book at the moment because the blogs,</v>

181
00:04:42.531 --> 00:04:43.400
<v Speaker 2>I've gone so well.</v>

182
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.140
<v Speaker 2>I felt to himself,</v>

183
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.143
<v Speaker 2>I'll call it fucking,</v>

184
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I looked beside looking back at the different stories,</v>

185
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.350
<v Speaker 2>kind of take the federal drinking water and everyone loved it.</v>

186
00:04:51.351 --> 00:04:52.760
<v Speaker 2>And a few more.</v>

187
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.511
<v Speaker 2>So I started thinking,</v>

188
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:54.300
<v Speaker 2>I've got fucking</v>

189
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.641
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

190
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:59.520
<v Speaker 1>that elite Exede stories are very important story from martial arts because that</v>

191
00:04:59.521 --> 00:05:00.450
<v Speaker 1>made me angry.</v>

192
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.280
<v Speaker 1>I was watching that at home and I was angry.</v>

193
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:02.551
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

194
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:03.211
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

195
00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:04.250
<v Speaker 1>And I love Kimbo.</v>

196
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I think he's an awesome guy.</v>

197
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.780
<v Speaker 1>He's a great character.</v>

198
00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:08.070
<v Speaker 1>I like watching him fight.</v>

199
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.530
<v Speaker 1>He won a boxing match recently.</v>

200
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:11.820
<v Speaker 1>He's been winning a lot of boxing matches.</v>

201
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.663
<v Speaker 1>I love that dude.</v>

202
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I wanted him to win or you to win,</v>

203
00:05:14.941 --> 00:05:16.350
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted fairness.</v>

204
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.920
<v Speaker 1>And you worked hard to get to that position and you were in a dominant position</v>

205
00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:22.890
<v Speaker 1>and they stood you back up and you were fucking tired and you've got cracked.</v>

206
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.110
<v Speaker 1>And they did the same thing with big country when big country had our Lawsky</v>

207
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.870
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

208
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.570
<v Speaker 1>He was working for a fucking Komora and they stood him up.</v>

209
00:05:30.571 --> 00:05:30.811
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

210
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:32.370
<v Speaker 1>are you crazy?</v>

211
00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:33.204
<v Speaker 1>It was quite ironic.</v>

212
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

213
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.780
<v Speaker 2>I watched a big country.</v>

214
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

215
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.520
<v Speaker 2>he was almost in exactly the same position as me when he beat Kimball on the,</v>

216
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.693
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

217
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.313
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

218
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

219
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Kinda not mentioned or no,</v>

220
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.520
<v Speaker 1>very close to the same position,</v>

221
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.911
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

222
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:49.350
<v Speaker 1>The only difference is he went with the mountain.</v>

223
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.280
<v Speaker 1>He had a full amount of crucifixions by,</v>

224
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.610
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure you could have worked towards.</v>

226
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.690
<v Speaker 1>You had him on his back.</v>

227
00:05:54.691 --> 00:05:55.920
<v Speaker 1>He was only going to get more tired.</v>

228
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:56.940
<v Speaker 1>There was a couple minutes to go</v>

229
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.230
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] without Phi.</v>

230
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.083
<v Speaker 2>It's not that.</v>

231
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 2>I think they should have stopped the fight because he came back and he,</v>

232
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:02.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

233
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.350
<v Speaker 2>and he was atomy rocked in the third round.</v>

234
00:06:04.351 --> 00:06:06.070
<v Speaker 2>He barely fucking up them,</v>

235
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

236
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.503
<v Speaker 2>punches.</v>

237
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.460
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

238
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.141
<v Speaker 2>I was rocked.</v>

239
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:09.974
<v Speaker 2>So it's not bad,</v>

240
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.650
<v Speaker 2>but they should have said,</v>

241
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:12.750
<v Speaker 2>you might knock me out.</v>

242
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.883
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

243
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.773
<v Speaker 2>I know man.</v>

244
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.380
<v Speaker 2>I took him down.</v>

245
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.493
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

246
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what a warm right.</v>

247
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.251
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking,</v>

248
00:06:20.251 --> 00:06:21.330
<v Speaker 2>the point of the fight.</v>

249
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.460
<v Speaker 2>You've got to let the fight conclude.</v>

250
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.510
<v Speaker 2>He could've knocked me out.</v>

251
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.171
<v Speaker 2>Make,</v>

252
00:06:25.171 --> 00:06:25.680
<v Speaker 2>cause I was,</v>

253
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 2>I was at one more tape down and he,</v>

254
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.433
<v Speaker 2>and he was mine.</v>

255
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

256
00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:32.850
<v Speaker 1>you take such a good shot and you take so many shots that sometimes people don't</v>

257
00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:33.810
<v Speaker 1>know what the fuck to do.</v>

258
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.100
<v Speaker 1>And I think a fight like that,</v>

259
00:06:35.101 --> 00:06:38.520
<v Speaker 1>like you took some bombs from Timbo and you were still there.</v>

260
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's like the referees like,</v>

261
00:06:39.961 --> 00:06:40.231
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

262
00:06:40.231 --> 00:06:41.580
<v Speaker 1>do I rescue this fucking guy?</v>

263
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird judgment call.</v>

264
00:06:43.501 --> 00:06:47.580
<v Speaker 1>And it's very important to have the right referee in a situation like that.</v>

265
00:06:47.581 --> 00:06:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Like a guy like herb dean,</v>

266
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.830
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>

267
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.910
<v Speaker 1>he'll let you fight,</v>

268
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 1>he'll let you fight if he,</v>

269
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.230
<v Speaker 1>but he will save you if he knows you're fucked,</v>

270
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.921
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

271
00:06:55.921 --> 00:06:56.291
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

272
00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:59.850
<v Speaker 1>that I think there's a lot of fights where the referee errs on the side of</v>

273
00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:01.530
<v Speaker 1>caution and protects the fighter.</v>

274
00:07:01.531 --> 00:07:03.300
<v Speaker 1>And in a case like yours,</v>

275
00:07:03.301 --> 00:07:05.550
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you were denied an opportunity because of that.</v>

276
00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:05.721
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

277
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

278
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

279
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Well what I was saying before,</v>

280
00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:10.140
<v Speaker 2>so I was I van Berlin,</v>

281

00:07:48.151 --> 00:07:48.984
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

309
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:50.170

310
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.003
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

311
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.800
<v Speaker 2>but he turned away or,</v>

312
00:07:52.801 --> 00:07:53.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

313

<v Speaker 2>I may turn back and when you have to go to the hospital now I'm taking you now</v>

315
00:07:59.701 --> 00:08:00.534
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

316
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.390
<v Speaker 2>you really want me to go to the hospital,</v>

317
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.433
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

318
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.813
<v Speaker 2>Too much.</v>

319
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.790
<v Speaker 2>So then I went to the Pratt conference instead,</v>

320
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.710
<v Speaker 2>and as I walked into the past conference,</v>

325
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.000

326
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.013
<v Speaker 2>And I think</v>

327
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.950
<v Speaker 2>that sums it all up there.</v>
