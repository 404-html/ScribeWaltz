<v Speaker 1>if people found his shit online and they</v>

20
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:52.761
<v Speaker 1>went and researched that and we talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first 20 minutes about the </v>

21
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>fleshlight is credit him somewhere not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

22
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Sex Talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

23
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>but sex toy.</v>

24
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if we disguise it?</v>

25
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Like we just talked about what we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with.</v>

26
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>The flashlight was back when we only had</v>
<v Speaker 1>one podcast a week and you know,</v>

27
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>now we do often three podcasts a week </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we still talk about the flashlight.</v>

28
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd never tried to charge them more </v>

29
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.250
<v Speaker 1>money ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if they skip a podcast,</v>

30
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit sometimes you have to.</v>

31
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>If it were,</v>

33
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I really wish Sam could just sit here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we could talk about it like two </v>

34
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>intelligent people,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It is the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am saying the same thing.</v>

47
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>So even though I'm trying not to say the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>

48
00:01:55.051 --> 00:02:00.051
<v Speaker 1>I'm still saying the same thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately I have to say that to get </v>

64
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>We have to do a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recognizing the fact that somebody might</v>

65
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>be tuning into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 2>pain is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work.</v>

120
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

121
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to experience pain so they,</v>

122
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:49.561
<v Speaker 2>they'll pierce themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if their genitals beside </v>

123
00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 2>sexual abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing with,</v>

124
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 2>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with genital piercing.</v>

125
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 2>But it's also because I thought it felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>better for them.</v>

126
00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever hear that nursing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it with like girls clips and </v>

127
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.451
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I always thought they were just </v>

128
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:03.451
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

137
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.670

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>kettlebells.</v>

197
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Kettlebells are expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're expensive as fuck for no reason </v>

198
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.331
<v Speaker 2>why you can get like high quality ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>made as long as you're selling them </v>

199
00:07:58.331 --> 00:07:58.331
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we would do it.</v>

200
00:07:58.331 --> 00:07:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Not trying to bring them to stores and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit like that.</v>

201
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:04.110
<v Speaker 2>So we could sell them like same quality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way cheaper than everybody else calls </v>

202
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.691

<v Speaker 2>You find out a lot of things and you </v>

203

<v Speaker 2>people make for shit.</v>

204
00:08:07.691 --> 00:08:09.160
<v Speaker 2>One of the things about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

207
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:13.100

<v Speaker 2>why is it so expensive?</v>

208
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Do our profit margin compared to most </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplements is way lower than the </v>

209
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.550
<v Speaker 2>ingredients are very fucking expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the shit that we have in is the best</v>

210
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:25.100
<v Speaker 2>quality available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're really doing it like the worst way</v>

211
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:28.610
<v Speaker 2>ever to make money because we're saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get 100 percent money back guarantee</v>

212
00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:33.611
<v Speaker 2>if you don't like if you use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it used to be you could buy up fucking </v>

213
00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:33.890
<v Speaker 2>100 bottles and you wouldn't even have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to send them back.</v>

214
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.950
<v Speaker 2>We would just give you your money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But too many people were ripping us off.</v>

215
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 2>They were selling them on Ebay and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had to stop doing that.</v>

216
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you order it,</v>

217
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 2>you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to send it back.</v>

218
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Just tell us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like it.</v>

219
00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Didn't do anything for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even something is strange as a vitamin,</v>

220
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:52.661
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know of a vitamin is doing </v>

221
00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:52.661
<v Speaker 2>something for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you really fucking know?</v>

222
00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:53.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much time does it take before you're</v>

223
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>so in tune with your body that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell when you have and have not</v>

224
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.220
<v Speaker 1>a multivitamin sign?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a radioactive vitamins,</v>

225
00:08:58.221 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 1>you can tell Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell,</v>

226
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 1>but that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take vitamins on a regular basis,</v>

227
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:04.560
<v Speaker 1>you will notice a difference in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>overall health.</v>

228
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:09.561
<v Speaker 1>I'm absolutely convinced of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is my experience in my life and </v>

229
00:09:09.561 --> 00:09:13.341
<v Speaker 1>I've read studies that say otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've also seen studies that I know </v>

230
00:09:13.341 --> 00:09:17.351
<v Speaker 1>are influenced by bullshit by </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies and they've </v>

231
00:09:17.351 --> 00:09:20.181
<v Speaker 1>been trying to license nutraceuticals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to make it so that </v>

232
00:09:20.181 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 1>vitamins are prescription only for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

233
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.740
<v Speaker 1>That's something pharmaceuticals </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies have lobby to </v>

234
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 1>try to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of times we shot down.</v>

235
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:33.500
<v Speaker 1>The pharmaceutical companies would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would have the rights to sell </v>

236
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:33.500
<v Speaker 1>vitamin C.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted vitamin C,</v>

237
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 1>you would have to go get a prescription </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

238
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have a terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have to go to doctors to get </v>

239
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 1>vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

240
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.011
<v Speaker 1>a fucking terrible that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you would have to give you a </v>

241
00:09:43.011 --> 00:09:43.011
<v Speaker 1>prescription for all of them.</v>

242
00:09:43.011 --> 00:09:43.011
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.320
<v Speaker 1>I guess unless we had some open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

244
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.910
<v Speaker 1>you would have to have things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>approved and then those things that were</v>

245
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:52.911
<v Speaker 1>approved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have an open prescription for </v>

246
00:09:52.911 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 1>any extra dietary nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's.</v>

247
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Unless you would have it every time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to get some vitamin D because </v>

248
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.260
<v Speaker 1>they can make money off of it and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could keep supplement companies.</v>

249
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the I the word right now,</v>

250
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:04.860
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gives it just regulating anybody.</v>

251
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.490
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem is that they feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

252
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not regulated enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

253
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.560
<v Speaker 1>and there's a good point too that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

254
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:15.561
<v Speaker 1>there's a very good point to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's way worse than way better </v>

255
00:10:15.561 --> 00:10:18.771
<v Speaker 1>rather than overregulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what it would be if you had a </v>

256
00:10:18.771 --> 00:10:18.960
<v Speaker 1>prescribed vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

257
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:19.800
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>

258
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.130
<v Speaker 1>People have figured out what works and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what doesn't work.</v>

259
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:28.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of scientific studies </v>

260
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.130
<v Speaker 1>about the efficacy of all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different multivitamins,</v>

261
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

262
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.160
<v Speaker 1>there's things that point to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can,</v>

263
00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain ones can help you in stress.</v>

264
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Be Twelve gives you energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

265
00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:37.770

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

266

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:46.310
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplementing the essential parts of </v>

<v Speaker 1>can't eat healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make sure I'm always taking vitamins.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it and then you can pop it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bowl.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's no way you're cleaning that out </v>

375
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:35.681
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get some of that stuff that </v>

<v Speaker 2>You have ever kept the pictures in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>house?</v>

379
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about a couple of weeks ago.</v>

380
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Piss all over mY fucking bed couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just found out.</v>

381
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that about?</v>

382
00:15:43.581 --> 00:15:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Like he's trying to tell you something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're a punk.</v>

383
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.450
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it.</v>

384
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Had a urinary infection of some kind and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it was from because now </v>

385
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.930
<v Speaker 2>she's not doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but use that as an excuse.</v>

386
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:55.930
<v Speaker 2>I think they just like pissing on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

387
00:15:55.931 --> 00:15:57.080
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mad.</v>

388
00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:02.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Urinary tract infection doesn't make </v>

389
00:16:02.081 --> 00:16:02.470
<v Speaker 2>them pee in one specific spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just bothers them.</v>

390
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.110
<v Speaker 2>They blame the eu when they put like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bird on your pillow.</v>

391
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.060
<v Speaker 2>That's them trying to give you a gift </v>
<v Speaker 2>card.</v>

392
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Your front doorstep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're presenting that to,</v>

393
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:13.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like you.</v>

394
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.930
<v Speaker 2>My other theory is that my dog has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>at my house for the last couple of weeks</v>

395
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.150
<v Speaker 2>and so the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's usually in town,</v>

396
00:16:20.151 --> 00:16:25.151
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts like chasing the cat and like </v>

397
00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:25.151
<v Speaker 2>it's so I think because now the dog's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>

398
00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:25.250
<v Speaker 2>The cats like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

399
00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:27.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm a P on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you always liked to sit?</v>

400
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

401
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you leaving the cat alone by itself </v>

402
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:33.940
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

403
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean the dogs just hanging out with </v>
<v Speaker 2>ron's dog at her house so they can play </v>

404
00:16:37.031 --> 00:16:38.880
<v Speaker 2>it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you ever had varans house and you're</v>

405
00:16:38.881 --> 00:16:40.780
<v Speaker 2>not at your house for extended periods </v>
<v Speaker 2>of time?</v>

406
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not more than a day or so.</v>

407
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

408
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I've left use in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left them for weeks,</v>

409
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.320
<v Speaker 2>but he knows the dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all lonelier.</v>

410
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Weirdly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only got two cats.</v>

411
00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.680
<v Speaker 2>They like the adults or hate each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

412
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.980
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

414
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.440
<v Speaker 2>She's all for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone hates the dog.</v>

415
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Hates most people would've said fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>old cats get fucking.</v>

416
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Either they stay cool or they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a cycling.</v>

417
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Chicks get old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they get like 45,</v>

418
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:15.320

<v Speaker 2>Really normal.</v>

419
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.930
<v Speaker 2>It's in dogs to uphold the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Women get angry when you don't want to </v>

<v Speaker 2>of their identity and people want that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She was in body heat.</v>

430
00:17:44.811 --> 00:17:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Kathleen turner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turner.</v>

431
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.650

<v Speaker 2>she was young?</v>

432
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.860
<v Speaker 2>She was romancing the stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

433
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.560
<v Speaker 2>so I think body heat was always that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sharon stone.</v>

434
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Sharon stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>romancing the stone.</v>

435
00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:58.710
<v Speaker 2>She was one of them.</v>

436
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 2>She was the fake one with Michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>Douglas.</v>

526
00:21:58.891 --> 00:21:58.930
<v Speaker 1>tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parts of it.</v>

527
00:21:58.931 --> 00:22:03.100
<v Speaker 1>A beautiful like amherst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Umass is fucking gorgeous town,</v>

528
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.870
<v Speaker 1>great town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool,</v>

529
00:22:04.871 --> 00:22:09.871
<v Speaker 1>like it's a really interesting place </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's really intelligent and you </v>

530
00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:14.011
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the college is pretty much </v>

531
00:22:14.011 --> 00:22:15.690
<v Speaker 1>any college town is gonna have a higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of intellect or at least her </v>

532
00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.350
<v Speaker 1>curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cambridge great place,</v>

533
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:18.910
<v Speaker 1>amazing place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

534
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:19.480
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

535
00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:21.940
<v Speaker 1>the city of boston essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a suburb of it.</v>

536
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.910
<v Speaker 1>But when you're in boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect example,</v>

537
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.200
<v Speaker 1>boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great town,</v>

538
00:22:26.201 --> 00:22:28.390
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why it's a great town</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so people are so smart,</v>

539
00:22:28.391 --> 00:22:30.100
<v Speaker 1>they're just because of the universities</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

540
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it always helps having to use a </v>

541
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.120
<v Speaker 1>university in a town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But God damn it doesn't make a bunch of </v>

542
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 1>fucking bleeding hearts to bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal pussies too.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Rent in town.</v>

546
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.160
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of manly intellectuals</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those towns,</v>

547
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.710
<v Speaker 1>you know it because it becomes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

548
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to say manly in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

549
00:22:52.411 --> 00:22:52.820

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

550
00:22:52.821 --> 00:22:56.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you knew you're good too much,</v>

<v Speaker 1>bougie,</v>

552
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.970
<v Speaker 1>because at a certain point you grow up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where like if you bump into</v>

553
00:23:00.971 --> 00:23:01.540
<v Speaker 1>somebody like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

560
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:12.850

<v Speaker 1>as too many people that don't have their</v>

561

<v Speaker 2>I think marriage is between a man and </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

580
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:56.690
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't it be between a man and a man?</v>

581
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.310
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

582
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.630
<v Speaker 2>what about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about three men?</v>

583
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Is that still marriage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

584
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:02.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's different.</v>

585
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's to say so why can't it be three </v>

586
00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:07.930
<v Speaker 2>men?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a really good point though.</v>

587
00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Why can't it be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be allowed to say what a dog </v>

588
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.830
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yo,</v>

589
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:17.350
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you clearly see the dog doesn't </v>

590
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.350
<v Speaker 2>want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But dog,</v>

591
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so because the dog can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>say yes I do.</v>

592
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.850
<v Speaker 2>How about a tree?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No man,</v>

593
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:20.990

<v Speaker 2>Why can'T you have three?</v>

596
00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you have four or five people </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

602
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 2>but these people didn't want to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

603
00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:46.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being irrelevant.</v>

604
00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:47.000
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

605
00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:52.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it's a man or woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a man or woman for thousands </v>

606
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.230
<v Speaker 2>of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying iT should be a man and a </v>

<v Speaker 2>Why can't they knOw that they should be </v>

612
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:04.170
<v Speaker 2>whining problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

613
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean people should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The social stigma and everYthing,</v>

614
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.630
<v Speaker 2>it should all.</v>

615
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.850
<v Speaker 2>It should take like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people go,</v>

616
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
<v Speaker 2>if people look at you and go look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this crazy ass hole with his three </v>

617
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:16.000
<v Speaker 2>wives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't even wanna hang around with</v>

618
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should be as punishment,</v>

619
00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.460
<v Speaker 2>but what I don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you shouldn't be allowed to.</v>

620
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

621
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:23.780
<v Speaker 2>The only punishment should be origin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People think it's weird.</v>

622
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Those people won't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only punishment,</v>

623
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:31.780
<v Speaker 2>but these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really fascinating the way they </v>

624
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:31.780
<v Speaker 2>were treating that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dilemma in the audience.</v>

625
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't see that.</v>

626
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.840
<v Speaker 2>It was just as close minded as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

627
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.720
<v Speaker 2>The guY who was anti gay marriage is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just as close minded.</v>

628
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.530
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

629
00:25:39.531 --> 00:25:42.840
<v Speaker 2>you're being irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a straw man.</v>

630
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Straw man argument to do that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They told us they're on people that are </v>

631
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:52.130
<v Speaker 2>against changing the marriage ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing gay marriage to to include it.</v>

632
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:57.110
<v Speaker 2>It's because they valued their type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage and when you allow other people</v>

633
00:25:57.111 --> 00:25:59.540
<v Speaker 2>to enter it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not your type of marriage.</v>

634
00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:03.230
<v Speaker 2>The man on one girl like cheapens the </v>
<v Speaker 2>value of what you have.</v>

635
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I would say that may be true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if that was the case,</v>

636
00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:08.740
<v Speaker 2>how come nobody got mad at the bachelor </v>
<v Speaker 2>or who wants to be.</v>

637
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Who wants to marry a millionaire or any </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those fucking stupid shows.</v>

638
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean if anything did devalue what what</v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage is,</v>

639
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:20.120
<v Speaker 2>it's drive through marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Casinos in vegas.</v>

640
00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:23.130
<v Speaker 2>You didn't like that when they heard </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

641
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's totally illegal.</v>

642
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:29.740
<v Speaker 2>How can we not fighting that could just </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive into a place and elvis can marry </v>

643
00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.620
<v Speaker 2>you in vegas and holding onto that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just holding onto like,</v>

644
00:26:31.621 --> 00:26:33.020
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just this way.</v>

645
00:26:33.021 --> 00:26:34.550
<v Speaker 2>This is what I have in common that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

646
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh man and a girl.</v>

647
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:39.500
<v Speaker 2>It's just people are assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't care about stupid shit.</v>

648
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.810
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

649
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.570
<v Speaker 2>why would you care?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

650
00:26:42.571 --> 00:26:47.571
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck what anybody else </v>

651
00:26:47.571 --> 00:26:47.571
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

652
00:26:47.571 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 2>the only reason I got married because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes my wife feel good.</v>

653
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:55.610
<v Speaker 2>She likes anybody gets married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why women like the women like </v>

654
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.611
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like to be able to tell their </v>

655
00:26:58.611 --> 00:26:59.661
<v Speaker 2>friends are married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had kids with her and I'm not going </v>

656
00:26:59.661 --> 00:26:59.661
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

657
00:26:59.661 --> 00:27:01.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm super happy if it's written on paper</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>

658
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:06.561
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you see things written on </v>

659
00:27:06.561 --> 00:27:06.561
<v Speaker 2>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some people it has.</v>

660
00:27:06.561 --> 00:27:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Leslie is extra significance or </v>
<v Speaker 2>culturally you're allowed to say,</v>

661
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:11.310
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're married.</v>

662
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is the level of the fact that </v>

663
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:16.440
<v Speaker 2>you're legally in tangled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

664
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:21.201
<v Speaker 2>Even though it's like a ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>notion to get legally entangled with a </v>

665
00:27:21.201 --> 00:27:24.141
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when there's 60 percent of </v>

666
00:27:24.141 --> 00:27:25.280
<v Speaker 2>them get divorced and have to sort out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

667
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the show they have not going to </v>

668
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:31.040
<v Speaker 2>last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so why should you get involved?</v>

669
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Because you love someone so much that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how mine was.</v>

670
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.280

<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to do your writing forever.</v>

671
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:36.240

<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

674
00:27:40.021 --> 00:27:45.021
<v Speaker 2>Just in just discussing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all ridiculous on marriage is </v>

675
00:27:45.021 --> 00:27:45.021
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

676
00:27:45.021 --> 00:27:48.450
<v Speaker 2>What's what matters is how do you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a person?</v>

677
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you love them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You love being around him to express </v>

<v Speaker 2>Of course it should be illegal.</v>

700
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:44.240
<v Speaker 2>It of course it's silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course why that when it devalues </v>

<v Speaker 2>person lives on your block and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>devalues a property of her home.</v>

703
00:28:47.271 --> 00:28:48.390
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what you're sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>block.</v>

718
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.450
<v Speaker 2>It was a nice black family and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>their kids inherited it after awhile and</v>

719
00:29:26.451 --> 00:29:27.960
<v Speaker 2>they had their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were a little,</v>

720
00:29:27.961 --> 00:29:31.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know wherever they were from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like there are more party people and</v>

<v Speaker 2>If every building was set up with </v>

779
00:32:02.971 --> 00:32:05.551
<v Speaker 2>explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so at any point they could just look at </v>

<v Speaker 2>happiness that you manage them.</v>

786
00:32:14.981 --> 00:32:19.981
<v Speaker 2>That's how they did every building they </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't because everybody would be </v>

787
00:32:19.981 --> 00:32:19.981
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will be just trying to get there.</v>

790
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.720
<v Speaker 2>There was a bunch of plans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them that got shot down that was </v>

791
00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.740
<v Speaker 2>supposedly they don't know where that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was headed.</v>

792
00:32:30.741 --> 00:32:31.960
<v Speaker 2>There might've been headed for the white</v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

793
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they said was headed south.</v>

794
00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.380
<v Speaker 2>That was 93.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the one that they said that the</v>

795
00:32:35.381 --> 00:32:38.350
<v Speaker 2>people brought it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the same.</v>

796
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

797
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.030
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

798
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:46.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rumsfeld actually made a mistake in an </v>

799
00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:46.810
<v Speaker 2>interview and said he got shot down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

800
00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

801
00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

802
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:51.940
<v Speaker 2>in 93 they shot down a 93 flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 three.</v>

803
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:56.950
<v Speaker 2>He like said it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that are </v>

804
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:57.350
<v Speaker 2>positive that it was shot down because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how far the debris was.</v>

805
00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:02.530
<v Speaker 2>The debris went as far as like seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles and then they made that let's roll</v>

806
00:33:04.341 --> 00:33:06.470
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that before and my thought on</v>

807
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:11.471
<v Speaker 2>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be okay if they shut that down </v>

808
00:33:11.471 --> 00:33:11.471
<v Speaker 2>clearly by the other three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's going to be.</v>

809
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:15.230
<v Speaker 2>It's going to find is something down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tough choice,</v>

810
00:33:15.231 --> 00:33:16.790
<v Speaker 2>but you got to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were eye witnesses,</v>

811
00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:21.650
<v Speaker 2>this other fighter jets who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either way it's horrific.</v>

812
00:33:21.651 --> 00:33:23.120
<v Speaker 2>If they crashed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's horrific.</v>

813
00:33:23.121 --> 00:33:28.121
<v Speaker 2>If it got shot down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's somehow or another people want </v>

814
00:33:28.121 --> 00:33:28.121
<v Speaker 2>to know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mystery,</v>

815
00:33:28.121 --> 00:33:33.040
<v Speaker 2>the mystery of what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they were starting to </v>

816
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:33.040
<v Speaker 2>hijack somewhere in the middle of mid </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation going and you know,</v>

817
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:38.021
<v Speaker 2>they checked my bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they checked the whole fucking bag was </v>

818
00:33:38.021 --> 00:33:42.380
<v Speaker 2>pre nine slash 11 was still too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>security for a lot of people.</v>

819
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Some people were probably upset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my.</v>

820
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:50.220
<v Speaker 2>My take on it is when bush got on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>

821
00:33:50.221 --> 00:33:52.670
<v Speaker 2>when they told the whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole let's roll story,</v>

822
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:54.500
<v Speaker 2>you know that the guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's roll.</v>

823
00:33:54.501 --> 00:33:56.690
<v Speaker 2>As they got out and they were going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go fight the terrorists and they brought</v>

824
00:33:56.691 --> 00:33:57.170
<v Speaker 2>the plane down.</v>

825
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:02.500
<v Speaker 2>My bullshit alarm on my bullshit alarm </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going off.</v>

826
00:34:06.021 --> 00:34:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a story I have no idea,</v>

827
00:34:08.631 --> 00:34:11.420
<v Speaker 2>but it does sound like a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like Jessica Lynch member.</v>

828
00:34:11.421 --> 00:34:15.350
<v Speaker 2>They had that story where they said that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had rescued her and hail of gunfire</v>

829
00:34:15.351 --> 00:34:17.810
<v Speaker 2>because she was being in prison by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>iraqis and they saved her.</v>

830
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.820
<v Speaker 2>This brave pretty girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it turns out she was actually in a </v>

831
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:22.910
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no gunfire at all.</v>

832
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's horseshit shit made about horseshit</v>

833
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:30.160
<v Speaker 2>story and she came out public with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people gave her death threats </v>

834
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:30.790
<v Speaker 2>because she'll against the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

835
00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got a lot of death threats.</v>

836
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.630
<v Speaker 2>The story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her story was quite simple.</v>

837
00:34:35.631 --> 00:34:40.631
<v Speaker 2>She got she.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some sort of a firefight or </v>

838
00:34:40.631 --> 00:34:41.090
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a military incident where </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was injured.</v>

839
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.920
<v Speaker 2>She was brought into a hospital.</v>

840
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.260
<v Speaker 2>They came and got her from the hospital </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they brought her back home.</v>

841
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's her story.</v>

842
00:34:46.881 --> 00:34:49.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what really happened with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

843
00:34:49.101 --> 00:34:54.101
<v Speaker 2>Said was that they had to go and rescue </v>
<v Speaker 2>her and they went in guns blazing to go </v>

844
00:34:54.101 --> 00:34:55.180
<v Speaker 2>get one of our own dot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>

845
00:34:55.181 --> 00:34:55.420
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>

846
00:34:55.421 --> 00:34:55.700
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot,</v>

847
00:34:55.701 --> 00:34:56.650
<v Speaker 2>dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that didn't happen.</v>

848
00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Did not happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did happen?</v>

849
00:34:58.041 --> 00:35:03.041
<v Speaker 2>Just that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just they went and got her at the </v>

850
00:35:03.041 --> 00:35:03.041
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

851
00:35:03.041 --> 00:35:03.041
<v Speaker 2>they went on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got the ones in the hospital,</v>

852
00:35:03.041 --> 00:35:07.250
<v Speaker 2>got her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought her home and then they choose a </v>

853
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:08.710
<v Speaker 2>local hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was in a hospital in Iraq and they </v>

854
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:09.770
<v Speaker 2>concocted a crazy story pretending that </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>

855
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:11.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had rescued her,</v>

856
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:16.240
<v Speaker 2>but all day they got their tissues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then another example is that the a </v>

857
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.470
<v Speaker 2>football player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's his name?</v>

858
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Human resources is really gay and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>says like,</v>

859
00:35:22.131 --> 00:35:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm a guy that went in there and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just destroyed everything was,</v>

860
00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he just writes these press releases</v>

861
00:35:27.411 --> 00:35:32.411
<v Speaker 2>that are just is guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's one person.</v>

862
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.410
<v Speaker 2>One group actually gets to decide what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story would be,</v>

863
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 2>but the point of it is there's,</v>

864
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

865
00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:42.720
<v Speaker 1>but they made him a hero for me here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At first.</v>

866
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.560
<v Speaker 1>I think it's normal for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's standard operational procedure for </v>

867
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.191
<v Speaker 1>them to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anytime they get a situation to </v>

868
00:35:52.191 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and spin the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be the precedent.</v>

869
00:35:53.731 --> 00:35:55.340
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

870
00:35:55.341 --> 00:36:00.341
<v Speaker 1>when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever there's some sort of a </v>

871
00:36:00.341 --> 00:36:00.341
<v Speaker 1>situation and then they tell you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

872
00:36:00.341 --> 00:36:02.490
<v Speaker 1>you can't prove that the let's roll is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not real Bible.</v>

873
00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was wondering why that If </v>

874
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.080
<v Speaker 1>they took over the claim to the bitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>end and like american,</v>

875
00:36:08.081 --> 00:36:13.081
<v Speaker 1>the font,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just somebody dove powell and pow and I </v>

876
00:36:13.081 --> 00:36:14.400
<v Speaker 1>don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

877
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:15.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

878
00:36:15.191 --> 00:36:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

879
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to believe that they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>lie that much,</v>

880
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:24.950
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe that they could though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they thought it was coming to the </v>

881
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.950
<v Speaker 1>white house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would shoot.</v>

882
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.720
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you probably should.</v>

883
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Going to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to kill the people anyway,</v>

884
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.910
<v Speaker 1>so you're making a decision to calibra </v>
<v Speaker 1>failed.</v>

885
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.600
<v Speaker 1>If people can't take control of the jet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it does shut three attacks,</v>

886
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or to go talk to this play,</v>

887
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.250
<v Speaker 1>they have no communication with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going out of.</v>

888
00:36:41.251 --> 00:36:43.340
<v Speaker 1>It's out of where it's supposed to fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

889
00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 1>So if you could pull up the audio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull up the audio of donald rumsfeld.</v>

890
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Flight 93.</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot down.</v>

891
00:36:48.901 --> 00:36:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Just pull up that donald rumsfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flight 93.</v>

892
00:36:52.141 --> 00:36:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's on youtube.</v>

893
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.010
<v Speaker 1>He could of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could have also been a slip.</v>

894
00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.380
<v Speaker 1>He could've just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fuck up all the time.</v>

895
00:36:58.381 --> 00:37:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say to you,</v>

896
00:37:00.061 --> 00:37:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brian,</v>

897
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:02.690
<v Speaker 1>why'd you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called brian.</v>

898
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.200
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

899
00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't because you don't even realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>you did in the military too,</v>

900
00:37:06.511 --> 00:37:07.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

901
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.360
<v Speaker 1>He served in the military at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rumsfeld?</v>

902
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never really hawks.</v>

903
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

904
00:37:12.811 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about all of them.</v>

905
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:21.790
<v Speaker 4>If the people who bombed the mess hall </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the people that get the bonding in </v>

906
00:37:21.841 --> 00:37:26.841
<v Speaker 4>Spain or the people who attacked the </v>
<v Speaker 4>United States in New York shot down the </v>

907
00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:29.360
<v Speaker 4>plane over Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pentagon</v>

908
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:35.090
<v Speaker 1>shot down because he's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's referring to the people who did the</v>

909
00:37:35.091 --> 00:37:36.190
<v Speaker 1>bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

910
00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.840
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like he was saying brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the plane.</v>

911
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Shot down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

912
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Like they brought it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They died,</v>

913
00:37:42.261 --> 00:37:45.450
<v Speaker 1>but he was talking about the bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't be the ones who would have</v>

914
00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:47.240
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad video.</v>

915
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we know.</v>

916
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.190
<v Speaker 1>He didn't really say that</v>

917
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:55.200
<v Speaker 5>I smoked mouth poop today by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is a huge mark about this big </v>

918
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.491
<v Speaker 5>that's been outside of my back patio for</v>
<v Speaker 5>the last couple of days and it hasn't </v>

919
00:37:59.491 --> 00:38:00.890
<v Speaker 5>moved like a word at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I've been looking at everyday.</v>

920
00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean as an been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hasn't moved at all what I was trying to</v>

921
00:38:04.331 --> 00:38:06.490
<v Speaker 5>say that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as it moved forward at all,</v>

922
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:12.470
<v Speaker 5>but it was really cool because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's like a little passe cheetah for </v>

923
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:16.650
<v Speaker 5>look like cheetah for on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it would be a chia pet cheetah </v>

924
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:16.650
<v Speaker 5>cheetah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was like,</v>

00:43:28.331 --> 00:43:28.331
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wolf's were like,</v>

1041
00:43:28.331 --> 00:43:30.830
<v Speaker 1>there were like monsters in this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There weren't like wolves.</v>

1042
00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:34.040
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took wolves and gave them some.</v>

1043
00:43:34.041 --> 00:43:36.650
<v Speaker 1>It was like some unnatural pack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves.</v>

1044
00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:41.300
<v Speaker 1>They behaved completely unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like it was,</v>

1045
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:42.500
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was part of it.</v>

1046
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:47.500
<v Speaker 1>It was hard to swallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've liked it if they were </v>

1047
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.481
<v Speaker 1>diseased or turned out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had got some fucking crazy </v>

1048
00:43:49.481 --> 00:43:51.190
<v Speaker 1>radiation or experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1049
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:53.810
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But instead they try to play it off.</v>

1050
00:43:53.811 --> 00:43:58.811
<v Speaker 1>Like these wolves are killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wolves have only killed 100 people ever </v>

1051
00:43:58.811 --> 00:43:59.420
<v Speaker 1>in the history of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1052
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a website where there's a </v>

1053
00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.461
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also another website that </v>

1054
00:44:06.461 --> 00:44:06.461
<v Speaker 1>like documents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolf,</v>

1055
00:44:06.461 --> 00:44:07.130
<v Speaker 1>human deaths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a big majority of them,</v>

1056
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I believe are in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in Russia it's more common.</v>

1057
00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.520
<v Speaker 1>They got meaner people up there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaner wolves,</v>

1058
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.280
<v Speaker 1>more bad ass thing of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1059
00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:18.530
<v Speaker 1>if a 10th and a guy had been killed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was half of the yellow,</v>

1060
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.420
<v Speaker 1>this is far greater than you ever could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have imagined.</v>

1061
00:44:20.421 --> 00:44:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's super rare.</v>

1062
00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:26.420
<v Speaker 1>There are a woman died like I think in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2005 or something like that.</v>

1063
00:44:26.421 --> 00:44:27.500
<v Speaker 1>We'll put that in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1064
00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:32.550
<v Speaker 1>in Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was running and I think I think </v>

1065
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:32.550
<v Speaker 1>if you</v>

1066
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:35.790
<v Speaker 2>fuck up and you just run by a wolf in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrong time,</v>

1067
00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:40.791
<v Speaker 2>they can't help but chase you like a dog</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like a cat with a ball of yarn and </v>

1068
00:44:40.791 --> 00:44:45.080
<v Speaker 2>they'd say that's a big part of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain lion attacks is people are </v>

1069
00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.530
<v Speaker 2>jogging or people riding bikes and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just can't help it.</v>

1070
00:44:46.531 --> 00:44:47.850
<v Speaker 2>The mountain lion thinks they're running</v>
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>

1071
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.670
<v Speaker 2>which is the next operating system from </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

1072
00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:53.370
<v Speaker 2>They announced out in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so weird.</v>

1073
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:58.940
<v Speaker 2>It seems like they're getting to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom of the barrel of cats with apple </v>

1074
00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:01.990
<v Speaker 2>and the whole cap thing and it's just </v>

<v Speaker 2>ultrasound before you have any sort of </v>

1124
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.470
<v Speaker 2>procedures because they want you to look</v>

<v Speaker 2>dictated like a medical procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've cOmmanding a medical procedure.</v>

1131
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:20.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely the weird liNe to cross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a total weiRd line to cross because</v>

1132
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:21.890
<v Speaker 2>you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1133
00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:26.900
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making the decision for the </v>

1134
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:26.900
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1135
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:26.900
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're deciding,</v>

1136
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:26.940
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do that.</v>

1137
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could get an ultrasound if they </v>

1138
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:31.960
<v Speaker 2>want to.</v>

1139
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:31.960
<v Speaker 2>They know they can sit where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>making them.</v>

1140
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 2>You're making them look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make sense to me.</v>

1141
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:36.880
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why you one more time before</v>

1142
00:47:36.881 --> 00:47:37.550
<v Speaker 2>you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1143
00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Why do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what's going on here.</v>

1144
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.730
<v Speaker 2>The real issue is what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on here as you're killing a</v>

1145
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:44.380
<v Speaker 2>baby?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One guy said it.</v>

1146
00:47:44.381 --> 00:47:45.930
<v Speaker 2>It goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only reasons it's legal.</v>

1147
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:48.220
<v Speaker 2>One of the republicans only reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>legal because,</v>

1148
00:47:48.221 --> 00:47:48.860
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1149
00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:52.390
<v Speaker 2>it's for convenience and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

1150
00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.340
<v Speaker 2>that's what we decided as a society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1151
00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.650
<v Speaker 2>We'll let that go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1152
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird line right though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because at a certain age you can't do it</v>

1153
00:47:58.901 --> 00:48:00.790
<v Speaker 2>anymore when somebody is months old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>

1154
00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what we do all the time.</v>

1155
00:48:02.651 --> 00:48:05.200
<v Speaker 2>That's when we raise the speed limit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifty miLes an hour when you know,</v>

1156
00:48:05.201 --> 00:48:07.690
<v Speaker 2>this is going to mean more deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This year dude,</v>

1157
00:48:07.691 --> 00:48:09.710
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend back in New York who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1158
00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.090
<v Speaker 2>his girl got a late term abortion really</v>
<v Speaker 2>late,</v>

1159
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:16.650
<v Speaker 2>like really late,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was illegal and it was,</v>

1160
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.750
<v Speaker 2>have the number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1161
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:24.980
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was reallY crazy because she was </v>

1162
00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.280
<v Speaker 2>showing really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1163
00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:29.020
<v Speaker 2>she was showing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she had an aBortion.</v>

1164
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:32.270
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking dark man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It Was dark and they wound on,</v>

1165
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:37.320
<v Speaker 2>went on to have children together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is even good as they went on to </v>

1166
00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.250
<v Speaker 2>have children together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the time I was really freaked out</v>

1167
00:48:39.251 --> 00:48:44.251
<v Speaker 2>by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really freaked out because I don't </v>

1168
00:48:44.251 --> 00:48:44.251
<v Speaker 2>remember how many months it was in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was enough where,</v>

1169
00:48:44.251 --> 00:48:45.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they told me,</v>

1170
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.770
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

1171
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Like this is dark man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1172
00:48:50.201 --> 00:48:50.740
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1173
00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I think that should be allowed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be allowed what to do.</v>

1174
00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.640
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean later abortions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be allowed to do them.</v>

1175
00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:58.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1176
00:48:58.770 --> 00:48:59.710
<v Speaker 2>like get them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1177
00:48:59.711 --> 00:49:02.230
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to get them to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

1178
00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:07.290
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like clearly at some point it's like </v>

1179
00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:07.290
<v Speaker 2>this light is going to continue.</v>

1180
00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I think Whatever it is right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

1181
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I think that's enough time for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find out that you're pregnant and you </v>

1182
00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:13.260
<v Speaker 2>need to do either make the decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes or no,</v>

1183
00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.220
<v Speaker 2>but I think anything after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after what?</v>

1184
00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like late term abortions.</v>

1185
00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:19.030
<v Speaker 2>WhaT month is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1186
00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.900
<v Speaker 2>I think three is that what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the longest you can go.</v>

1187
00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:24.220
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with late term is six and on.</v>

1188
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:26.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying what it is now.</v>

1189
00:49:26.901 --> 00:49:30.850
<v Speaker 2>It's six months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six months.</v>

1190
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a baby.</v>

1191
00:49:32.321 --> 00:49:36.120
<v Speaker 2>People still want to do it at four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1192
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.880
<v Speaker 2>That's just to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

1193
00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:40.710
<v Speaker 2>That's human life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very clearly human life.</v>

1194
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:42.460
<v Speaker 2>One difference between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But let me,</v>

1195
00:49:42.461 --> 00:49:44.510
<v Speaker 2>let me get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me be real with you here.</v>

1196
00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Part of part of what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of being objective about it </v>

1197
00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:54.061
<v Speaker 2>and you're being honest about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but part of what you're saying is a </v>

1198
00:49:54.061 --> 00:49:54.061
<v Speaker 2>little bit for shock value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1199
00:49:54.061 --> 00:49:55.510
<v Speaker 2>four months while you can't even see a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bulge at that point.</v>

1200
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

1201
00:49:56.350 --> 00:50:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For months never been in a science </v>

1202
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:01.350
<v Speaker 2>museum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1203
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:02.450
<v Speaker 2>but three months you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for months you can.</v>

1204
00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.520
<v Speaker 2>You can as well look this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think three months again as well,</v>

1205
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:08.460
<v Speaker 2>so then you can see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still okay to do it that way.</v>

1206
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:09.610
<v Speaker 2>OkaY.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at fetus.</v>

1207
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:12.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it's remarkably soon that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could tell it's person.</v>

1208
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.780
<v Speaker 2>You've seen a baby's butt hole before </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just brand.</v>

1209
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:20.990
<v Speaker 2>So when would you think it should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal?</v>

1210
00:50:20.991 --> 00:50:22.540
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you can see any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bulge.</v>

1211
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this three months,</v>

1212
00:50:24.071 --> 00:50:25.600
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what you're saying.</v>

1213
00:50:25.601 --> 00:50:27.620
<v Speaker 2>That's when you think it should be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is three weeks.</v>

1214
00:50:27.621 --> 00:50:28.060
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1215
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.320
<v Speaker 2>this is 13 weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This stuff.</v>

1216
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:34.160
<v Speaker 2>That's a baby man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking baby sucking its stomach.</v>

1217
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Three months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you see it through the stomach?</v>

1218
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Can you see a bulge in the woman's </v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach?</v>

1219
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Now I want to just show me a picture of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much blown that up </v>

1220
00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:44.020
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for different.</v>

1221
00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:44.020
<v Speaker 2>some women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1222
00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:44.500
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1223
00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.860
<v Speaker 2>You're saying that's too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's too far.</v>

1224
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.980
<v Speaker 2>And it's like how far that sound by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1225
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.380
<v Speaker 2>That's image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a real image.</v>

1226
00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.330
<v Speaker 2>This is an image of what it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented.</v>

1227
00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.570
<v Speaker 2>This is what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1228
00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:57.650
<v Speaker 2>it's a human life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like almost immediately,</v>

1229
00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying with our,</v>

1230
00:51:00.441 --> 00:51:03.010
<v Speaker 2>with our current microscopic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1231
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:08.710
<v Speaker 2>like abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you can make it out based on </v>

1232
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.710
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how it should be illegal.</v>

1233
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:09.500
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1234
00:51:09.501 --> 00:51:10.540
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

1235
00:51:10.541 --> 00:51:12.230
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So random.</v>

1236
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:15.320
<v Speaker 2>It is a really good question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at what Point in time does it become</v>

1237
00:51:15.321 --> 00:51:20.321
<v Speaker 2>a life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it become a life when it's two </v>

1238
00:51:20.321 --> 00:51:20.321
<v Speaker 2>sales?</v>

1239
00:51:20.321 --> 00:51:22.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it 20 cells and I think as soon as </v>

1240
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.490
<v Speaker 2>they start moving on its own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was it going to leak.</v>

1241
00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.400
<v Speaker 2>It can start leading to life and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like life,</v>

1242
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's life inside you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1243
00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:29.300
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have children,</v>

1244
00:51:29.301 --> 00:51:32.120
<v Speaker 2>when your wife is pregnant or if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever have a girl that's pregnant,</v>

1245
00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:37.360
<v Speaker 2>you touch your stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you know the baby's only a few </v>

1246
00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:37.360
<v Speaker 2>months old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start kicking man.</v>

1247
00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's when you can feel it through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach skin.</v>

1248
00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's some living thing inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>of her.</v>

1249
00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where you can feel it like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the week before you can feel it.</v>

1250
00:51:43.221 --> 00:51:44.660
<v Speaker 2>That's not a living thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1251
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:49.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still living is not quite strong </v>

1252
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:49.690
<v Speaker 2>enough to get through the skin layer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's moving.</v>

1253
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:49.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1254
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:52.610
<v Speaker 2>it's a living thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean living way before that,</v>

1255
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:53.270
<v Speaker 2>but it can't.</v>

1256
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:58.300
<v Speaker 2>It can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't know that it's moving </v>

1257
00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.221
<v Speaker 2>around until you start suits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you can feel that's what you think </v>

1258
00:52:00.221 --> 00:52:00.221
<v Speaker 2>is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was just saying hand,</v>

1259
00:52:00.221 --> 00:52:04.901
<v Speaker 2>you should feel totally on its moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>long before this late term abortion </v>

1260
00:52:04.901 --> 00:52:05.570
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's moving,</v>

1261
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:11.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when you should be able to </v>

1262
00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:11.200
<v Speaker 2>draw a line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a.</v>

1263
00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:11.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a philosophical in a moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

1264
00:52:11.601 --> 00:52:16.601
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what time does it become a </v>

1265
00:52:16.601 --> 00:52:16.601
<v Speaker 2>life and no one is really wrapped their </v>
<v Speaker 2>head around that,</v>

1266
00:52:16.601 --> 00:52:20.981
<v Speaker 2>but for a lot of liberal people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even want to address the </v>

1267
00:52:20.981 --> 00:52:22.580
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>IT becomes more of of you trying to take</v>

1268
00:52:22.581 --> 00:52:26.270
<v Speaker 2>away a woman's right to choose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll look at their names and the tooth,</v>

1269
00:52:26.271 --> 00:52:27.770
<v Speaker 2>but the tooth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not even against each other.</v>

1270
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.800
<v Speaker 2>One is pro life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The others not anti-life.</v>

1271
00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one is pro choice.</v>

1272
00:52:31.371 --> 00:52:33.410
<v Speaker 2>The other one's not against people </v>
<v Speaker 2>having choices.</v>

1273
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the choice to kill you.</v>

1274
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:36.260
<v Speaker 2>That's my choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1275
00:52:36.261 --> 00:52:41.261
<v Speaker 2>But that one prolife once a month and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't talked about the same things </v>

1276
00:52:41.261 --> 00:52:44.730
<v Speaker 2>sort of they are though with what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really crazy is the most pro life people</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>babies and how many people are out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're the same people that support</v>

<v Speaker 2>the war and the same people that would </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>don't honk.</v>

1297
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I've seen there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1298
00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:35.490
<v Speaker 1>on the corner about three or four miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from here.</v>

1299
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:40.640
<v Speaker 1>There was this one intersection that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a hot intersection for some reason </v>

1300
00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.210
<v Speaker 1>for gaY marriage folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that were anti gay marriage and </v>

1301
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:48.230
<v Speaker 1>people that were into the war for same </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner and the one member of that </v>

1302
00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:50.160
<v Speaker 1>proposition eight shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that was going down,</v>

1303
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.890
<v Speaker 1>they were all just lined up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1304
00:53:52.891 --> 00:53:57.891
<v Speaker 1>marriage is between a man and a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>and god is not in the fucking quoting </v>

1305
00:53:57.891 --> 00:54:00.050
<v Speaker 1>psalms and shed and holding it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Punk if you believed marriages for a man</v>

1306
00:54:00.051 --> 00:54:02.750
<v Speaker 1>and woman and the other time was this </v>
<v Speaker 1>war thing.</v>

1307
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:07.070
<v Speaker 1>People were fucking screaming at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1308
00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:11.360
<v Speaker 1>people screaming at each other know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of America.</v>

1309
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:14.970
<v Speaker 1>There was several times where I drove by</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people in cars,</v>

1310
00:54:14.971 --> 00:54:17.820
<v Speaker 1>we're screaming at the people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street and they were screaming</v>

1311
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:22.950
<v Speaker 5>back and forth at each other was just </v>
<v Speaker 5>arrest him because it's against the law </v>

1312
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:23.760
<v Speaker 5>for you to honk your horn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so telling people to honk your horn,</v>

1313
00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.590
<v Speaker 5>be against the law to honk your horn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

1314
00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:30.650
<v Speaker 5>Why do you have a horn?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's only no way you can get a ticket </v>

1315
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:34.420
<v Speaker 5>for a honking horn for no reason really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for no reason to go.</v>

1316
00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:40.020
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you saw some shit right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought I saw some shit.</v>

1317
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:42.090
<v Speaker 5>What's the reason you see that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy that was coming?</v>

1318
00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:47.130
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the other lane that was coming towards </v>

1319
00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:47.130
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's someone who's headlight.</v>

1320
00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:50.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but still it's telling you to do </v>

1321
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:50.480
<v Speaker 5>something illegal and people holding </v>
<v Speaker 5>signs up for that.</v>

1322
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:55.490
<v Speaker 5>Really illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like that's one of those myths </v>

1323
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:57.480
<v Speaker 5>and I feel like you should be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>like drive through an intersection and </v>

1324
00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:57.480
<v Speaker 5>honk and your friends.</v>

1325
00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:02.710
<v Speaker 5>Can you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's one of those things where </v>

1326
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:04.221
<v Speaker 5>it's like it's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no one's ever going ticket for it </v>

1327
00:55:04.221 --> 00:55:04.221
<v Speaker 5>unless you've started just honking your </v>
<v Speaker 5>horn for no reason.</v>

1328
00:55:04.221 --> 00:55:09.021
<v Speaker 5>If you saw someone in the corner and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a cop there and you are brett </v>

1329
00:55:09.021 --> 00:55:09.021
<v Speaker 5>brown,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's up?</v>

1330
00:55:09.021 --> 00:55:09.021
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think,</v>

1331
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:11.070
<v Speaker 5>have you been arrested for that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you would say?</v>

1332
00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.860
<v Speaker 5>Get arrested but get ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get fined probably or a warning.</v>

1333
00:55:13.861 --> 00:55:17.510
<v Speaker 5>Most likely we got too many rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's way too many.</v>

1334
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:20.310
<v Speaker 5>If that really is a law that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's pathetic.</v>

1335
00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:22.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't be a con.</v>

1336
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:24.870
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't be blaring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're fucking hormone everywhere,</v>

1337
00:55:24.871 --> 00:55:29.871
<v Speaker 5>but there shouldn't be a law against it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's a really interesting video </v>

1338
00:55:29.871 --> 00:55:29.871
<v Speaker 5>online.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1339
00:55:29.871 --> 00:55:34.480
<v Speaker 5>it was taken in Nevada where some dude </v>
<v Speaker 5>went through a sobriety checkpoint and </v>

1340
00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.910
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't answer any of the questions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember that.</v>

1341
00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:40.970
<v Speaker 5>Did you see it go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know my rights to roll down your </v>

1342
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.970
<v Speaker 5>window to place it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that a direct command or not?</v>

1343
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:42.600
<v Speaker 5>I think I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>please hold on your window is like,</v>

1344
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:43.500

<v Speaker 5>I will not.</v>

1345
00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:46.020
<v Speaker 5>It just kept standing there like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh bang,</v>

1350

1353
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.420
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1354
00:56:00.421 --> 00:56:02.430
<v Speaker 5>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They say an asking matter.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that Donald Trump,</v>

1366
00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:31.250
<v Speaker 5>they can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is they'll just get the dog </v>

1367
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 5>and then they have a dog.</v>

<v Speaker 5>The majority.</v>

1373
00:56:41.021 --> 00:56:43.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they have plants in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Evidence,</v>

1374
00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:47.670
<v Speaker 5>but cops planting evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Humongous majority.</v>

1375
00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:52.000
<v Speaker 5>Never planted any evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean everyone says the cop is planting</v>

1376

<v Speaker 5>evidence,</v>

1384
00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:19.890
<v Speaker 1>All of them either wound up dead or </v>
<v Speaker 1>wound up in jail for corruption.</v>

1385
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Really all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole police after a while where </v>

<v Speaker 1>they all just like tell the other ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>is how we do stuff.</v>

00:57:26.341 --> 00:57:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1388
00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:27.890
<v Speaker 1>this is way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's done well.</v>

1389
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Especially the money amount of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's involved in cocaine in miami and </v>

1390
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:36.141
<v Speaker 1>the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must've been fucking completely </v>

1391
00:57:36.141 --> 00:57:36.141
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of good cops.</v>

1392
00:57:36.141 --> 00:57:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Most cops are good cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

1393
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.780
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's most people are great.</v>

1394
00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:42.090
<v Speaker 1>You knoW,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people that I meet day to day in my</v>

1395
00:57:42.091 --> 00:57:43.920
<v Speaker 1>life are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are fine folk.</v>

1396
00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:49.130
<v Speaker 1>There's only occasionally one or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out of a vast majority that suck </v>

1397
00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:52.380
<v Speaker 1>and those stand out and you go off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking people suck.</v>

1398
00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.620
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look in America and you know,</v>

1399
00:57:55.621 --> 00:58:00.621
<v Speaker 1>in a nice place like los angeles where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are doing pretty good for the </v>

1400
00:58:00.621 --> 00:58:00.621
<v Speaker 1>most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1401
00:58:00.621 --> 00:58:01.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not starving to death.</v>

1402
00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:03.300
<v Speaker 1>People were pretty god damn nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty civil.</v>

1403
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Most people are cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1404
00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:07.380
<v Speaker 1>the majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority are cool,</v>

1405
00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:10.350
<v Speaker 1>but if a few of them are cons you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>start going.</v>

1406
00:58:10.351 --> 00:58:14.370
<v Speaker 1>People are going to the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>our so hard,</v>

1407
00:58:14.371 --> 00:58:16.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's like some do but some don't at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1408
00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:18.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of what I was going to say about the</v>

1409
00:58:18.601 --> 00:58:23.601
<v Speaker 1>video where the cop was talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy and the guy wouldn't answer any </v>

1410
00:58:23.601 --> 00:58:28.011
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that was interesting </v>

1411
00:58:28.011 --> 00:58:28.011
<v Speaker 1>about it was a fucking together.</v>

1412
00:58:28.011 --> 00:58:28.011
<v Speaker 1>The cops were keeping him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1413
00:58:28.011 --> 00:58:30.030
<v Speaker 1>this count as being kind of shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1414
00:58:30.031 --> 00:58:31.770
<v Speaker 1>I guess they knew they were being filmed</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

1415
00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a little bit of that too,</v>

1416
00:58:34.261 --> 00:58:39.261
<v Speaker 1>because he had a camera and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get to the asking them where they're </v>

1417
00:58:39.261 --> 00:58:39.261
<v Speaker 1>pulling together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1418
00:58:39.261 --> 00:58:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Both the two cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his supervisor came over as well know,</v>

1419
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:46.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're just trying to make sure </v>

1420
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.910
<v Speaker 1>people aren't drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1421
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:49.500
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they get caught with the camera </v>

1422
00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:49.500
<v Speaker 1>that's in their own car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

1425
00:58:50.191 --> 00:58:52.800
<v Speaker 1>do you get so complacent that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like what you're doing is right?</v>

1426
00:58:52.801 --> 00:58:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I feel like they're gonna be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>erase the evidence.</v>

1427
00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.010
<v Speaker 1>HoW old is this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>haven't they gone after him a bunch of </v>

1493
01:01:16.181 --> 01:01:16.181
<v Speaker 1>times?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

1494
01:01:16.181 --> 01:01:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a big issue right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>with um,</v>

1495
01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.260
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're allowed to write off.</v>

1496
01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not like a regular business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not allowed to write off,</v>

1497
01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:23.270
<v Speaker 1>they won't take tax on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that's we're just trying to</v>

1498
01:01:23.271 --> 01:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>make illegal legal to take taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't take,</v>

1499
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>they must be taking some taxes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical weed.</v>

1500
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a huge form of tax revenue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1501
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Medical weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they said they on their own.</v>

1502
01:01:33.621 --> 01:01:38.240
<v Speaker 1>They said we're going to pay taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's find a medical marijuana tax.</v>

1503
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Taxation tax revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about in like are they now paying </v>

1504
01:01:45.681 --> 01:01:50.681
<v Speaker 1>tax because I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or are they just doing it because they </v>

1505
01:01:50.681 --> 01:01:50.681
<v Speaker 1>let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1506
01:01:50.681 --> 01:01:50.681
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still.</v>

1507
01:01:50.681 --> 01:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>And voters approve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1508
01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:53.300
<v Speaker 1>So they had to approve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what it is.</v>

1509
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Voters had to approve marijuana tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Revenue measure measure.</v>

1510
01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Sixty percent of voters decided tuesday </v>
<v Speaker 1>to honor measure m,</v>

1511
01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:06.850
<v Speaker 1>a city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What major am who am with a citywide </v>

1512
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>ballot measure that imposes new taxes on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sales of medical marijuana at brick </v>

1513
01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:14.120
<v Speaker 1>and mortar dispensary's?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It allows city tax,</v>

1514
01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:17.270
<v Speaker 1>brick and mortar dispensary's $50 out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>each one.</v>

1515
01:02:17.271 --> 01:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Thousand in gross reimbursements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's five percent.</v>

1516
01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>$50 out of $100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1517
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:25.300
<v Speaker 1>It's five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1518
01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>So how much will they already get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five percent is what their taxes.</v>

1519
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.720
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sales tax is eight point two.</v>

1520
01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>five data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on top of that I think.</v>

1521
01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think this is a city tax.</v>

1526
01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:48.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making plenty of money or they </v>

1527
01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:49.160
<v Speaker 1>are a little bit less hollywood lawyer.</v>

1539
01:03:17.901 --> 01:03:17.901
<v Speaker 1>be able to go to them.</v>

1540
01:03:17.901 --> 01:03:21.720
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that if I go straight to the </v>

1544
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

1545
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I would rather give that extra 100 bucks</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever to the store so that they </v>

1546
01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:30.930
<v Speaker 1>can make some profit and they can keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>

1547
01:03:30.931 --> 01:03:33.210
<v Speaker 1>I like to conduct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't make a profit that I supposedly.</v>

1548
01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.140
<v Speaker 1>They're not allowed to make profit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1549
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.460

<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

1550
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.480
<v Speaker 1>that's completely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it that just read that where they're </v>

1551
01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:41.480
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's absolutely wrong.</v>

1552
01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.960
<v Speaker 1>That's just a misinterpretation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this rule.</v>

1553
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I just read something.</v>

<v Speaker 1>profit,</v>

1557
01:03:50.671 --> 01:03:52.050
<v Speaker 1>but they were allowed to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1558
01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.880
<v Speaker 1>you're getting paid $30 an hour.</v>

01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:59.090
<v Speaker 1>You weight goes is you're not allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make profit like a normal corporation </v>

1560
01:03:59.090 --> 01:03:59.160
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but would.</v>

1561
01:03:59.161 --> 01:04:02.460

<v Speaker 1>commensurate for someone who would be in</v>

1564
01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:11.100
<v Speaker 1>your type of business so you could make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a salary of $100,000</v>

<v Speaker 1>the community and the source of a </v>

1568
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:24.690
<v Speaker 1>charity and the in the form of charity </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the form of grants.</v>

<v Speaker 1>make 60 percent of the profits.</v>

1574
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:40.290

1620
01:06:32.741 --> 01:06:37.741

<v Speaker 5>You can get a weaker noises making </v>
<v Speaker 5>stupid song the hedgehog.</v>

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.650
<v Speaker 5>Now shut that stupid shit off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Said.</v>

1630
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:03.670
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to turn it off.</v>

1631
01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:04.480
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's ridiculous.</v>

1632
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:07.570
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

1633
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:09.220
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would the music be so stupid?</v>

1634
01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:10.090
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here we go.</v>

1635
01:07:10.091 --> 01:07:13.180
<v Speaker 5>Medical marijuana profit is allowed </v>
<v Speaker 5>under California law.</v>

1636
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:14.460
<v Speaker 5>should I read it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1637
01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.470
<v Speaker 5>Fuck your wife ever eventually when it </v>
<v Speaker 5>loads up,</v>

1638
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:21.310
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing a review on it.</v>

1639
01:07:21.311 --> 01:07:24.060
<v Speaker 5>A deaTh squad that was a fun so far.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty awesome.</v>

1640
01:07:24.061 --> 01:07:29.061
<v Speaker 5>And I like has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has three g and you don't have any </v>

1641
01:07:29.061 --> 01:07:29.061
<v Speaker 5>contracts so you can just pay as you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1642
01:07:29.061 --> 01:07:30.820
<v Speaker 5>the cameras not that good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the graphics,</v>

1643
01:07:30.821 --> 01:07:33.130
<v Speaker 5>the screens amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The gains are amazing.</v>

1644
01:07:33.131 --> 01:07:36.580
<v Speaker 5>You could download any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the previous console.</v>

1645
01:07:36.581 --> 01:07:39.310
<v Speaker 5>So nowadays are kind of switching to </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you download your video games.</v>

1646
01:07:39.311 --> 01:07:41.200
<v Speaker 5>IT's still bind to the store.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

1647
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:43.330
<v Speaker 5>Oh that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So instead of,</v>

1648
01:07:43.331 --> 01:07:48.331
<v Speaker 5>so instead of getting a district,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just download it and you just </v>

1649
01:07:48.331 --> 01:07:48.331
<v Speaker 5>download it and then you can delete it </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you want to,</v>

1650
01:07:48.331 --> 01:07:52.680
<v Speaker 5>you can delete it or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only negative really going to get </v>

1651
01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:52.680
<v Speaker 5>rid of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>

1652
01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:56.810
<v Speaker 5>that's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything's going to be in a cloud </v>

1653
01:07:56.810 --> 01:07:56.810
<v Speaker 5>downloads I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that though.</v>

1654
01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:03.840
<v Speaker 5>my learn loan for a quarter phone hEr,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to go bad.</v>

1655
01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:06.910
<v Speaker 5>I'll do it man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want everything in the cloUd.</v>

1656
01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.350
<v Speaker 5>I do like the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they do it right,</v>

1657
01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:12.250
<v Speaker 5>like itunes just recently switched over </v>
<v Speaker 5>to doing it right where it shows you all</v>

1658
01:08:12.251 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 5>the purchase cd songs that you've ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>downloaded on itunes and you can</v>

1659
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.120
<v Speaker 6>look it and you could read down to 100 </v>
<v Speaker 6>gigabytes of total songs.</v>

1660
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:27.910
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are you allowed to talk about what </v>

1661
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.910
<v Speaker 6>happened in Minnesota?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1662
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:30.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I only know pieces of this.</v>

1663
01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:32.630
<v Speaker 6>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because I have to leave out.</v>

1664
01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:34.520
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a,</v>

1665
01:08:34.521 --> 01:08:37.330
<v Speaker 6>a thing that ari shaffir does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all a lark.</v>

1666
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:42.550
<v Speaker 6>I mean he pretends that what he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>is hiding marijuana all around town and </v>

1667
01:08:42.771 --> 01:08:47.771
<v Speaker 6>then he calls it a hunt for the edible </v>
<v Speaker 6>when it's really just lollipops candy.</v>

1668
01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.120
<v Speaker 6>Who wouldn't do that to you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't handle it.</v>

1669
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:51.980
<v Speaker 6>It would be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It would be cute if you can handle it,</v>

1670
01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.680
<v Speaker 6>but you can't handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that said,</v>

1671
01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:59.770
<v Speaker 6>but coincidentally I do live in a state </v>
<v Speaker 6>where they could sell a really small </v>

1672
01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:00.290
<v Speaker 6>stuff all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1673
01:09:00.330 --> 01:09:02.750
<v Speaker 6>But anyone pretty much here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not legal for us here.</v>

1674
01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:04.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah.</v>

1675
01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:05.750
<v Speaker 6>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

1676
01:09:05.751 --> 01:09:10.751
<v Speaker 6>I've had them before,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I had little scavenger hunts for </v>

1677
01:09:10.751 --> 01:09:12.500
<v Speaker 6>this clearly fake only tobacco product.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm noT marijuana.</v>

1678
01:09:12.501 --> 01:09:15.530
<v Speaker 6>Whatever you think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just to see if you got high from it.</v>

1679
01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:18.310
<v Speaker 6>Placebo effect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really easy with diabetes.</v>

1680
01:09:18.930 --> 01:09:22.070
<v Speaker 6>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got dizzy.</v>

1681
01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:22.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's fun.</v>

1682
01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:24.980
<v Speaker 6>People just made some clues and people </v>
<v Speaker 6>just find it.</v>

1683
01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.560
<v Speaker 6>And you have been organizing this </v>
<v Speaker 6>through twitter.</v>

1684
01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:33.340
<v Speaker 6>It seems like a solid plan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well it's good that you're not using </v>

1685
01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:37.121
<v Speaker 6>real pot because it's totally fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>heart attacks and freak the fuck out </v>

1686
01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:39.010
<v Speaker 6>did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you did this.</v>

1687
01:09:39.011 --> 01:09:41.900
<v Speaker 6>So usually I do them not in a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a specific type of place,</v>

1688
01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:44.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just do them somewhere like out.</v>

1689
01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:46.370
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did it this time.</v>

1690
01:09:46.371 --> 01:09:51.050
<v Speaker 6>I tried doing at the mall of America </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't like fort knox.</v>

1691
01:09:51.051 --> 01:09:52.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all locked down now.</v>

1692
01:09:52.281 --> 01:09:55.060
<v Speaker 6>I guess they have their own security and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have regular police there too.</v>

1693
01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:56.960
<v Speaker 6>And so what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1694
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:59.330
<v Speaker 6>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I decided instead of hiding it,</v>

1695
01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.940
<v Speaker 6>like in the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like near a pillar or something,</v>

1696
01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:07.210
<v Speaker 6>I figured there'd be less cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I should go into a store and hide </v>

1697
01:10:07.210 --> 01:10:08.370
<v Speaker 6>their increased business for them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1698
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.190
<v Speaker 6>And so I did that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the store grubbY hippies out looking for</v>

1699
01:10:13.191 --> 01:10:14.450
<v Speaker 6>fucking free.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'd also like,</v>

1700
01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:15.600
<v Speaker 6>what kind of clues can I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1701
01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:17.270
<v Speaker 6>what's it around that I can think of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>clue for.</v>

1702
01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:23.260
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then I found a place and then I </v>

1703
01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:26.291
<v Speaker 6>left,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was like good a building boom that I </v>

1704
01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:26.291
<v Speaker 6>waited for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1705
01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:26.291
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a few hours,</v>

1706
01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:28.210
<v Speaker 6>started writing the clues and then I </v>
<v Speaker 6>started releasing them.</v>

1707
01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:30.760
<v Speaker 6>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And people that are looking for it first</v>

1708
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:35.770
<v Speaker 6>I narrowed down like a side of the mall,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then like a floor and then like the </v>

1709
01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:37.070
<v Speaker 6>store then like where?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anyway,</v>

1710
01:10:37.071 --> 01:10:38.270
<v Speaker 6>so the show would just order.</v>

1711
01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.030
<v Speaker 6>The mc was on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was texting outside and um,</v>

1712
01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:46.690
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just saw a cop to my right to my left </v>

1713
01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:46.690
<v Speaker 6>just standing there and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>alright.</v>

1714
01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:47.090
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I looked up and I was like,</v>

1715
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:50.540
<v Speaker 6>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is happening now.</v>

1716
01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:53.450
<v Speaker 6>I really didn't think it would.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1717
01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:56.530
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck.</v>

1749
01:12:06.831 --> 01:12:08.781
<v Speaker 6>because it's only legal with a license </v>

01:12:08.781 --> 01:12:09.360
<v Speaker 6>It isn't illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing.</v>

1752
01:12:09.361 --> 01:12:14.361
<v Speaker 6>It's decriminalized in California to a </v>
<v Speaker 6>certain amount as long as you don't </v>

1753
01:12:14.361 --> 01:12:14.361
<v Speaker 6>think you're distributing it.</v>

1764
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.790

01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:41.710
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1770
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:52.570
<v Speaker 6>So because it was a male clothing store,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to hide it,</v>

1771
01:12:52.571 --> 01:12:57.571
<v Speaker 6>a lane bryant at a fabric store,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I didn't think I'd get in there </v>

1772
01:12:57.571 --> 01:12:59.100
<v Speaker 6>without being noticed as well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like why would it even be in there?</v>

1773
01:12:59.530 --> 01:13:01.560
<v Speaker 6>Because you look like something that </v>
<v Speaker 6>would date a fat person.</v>

1774
01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:09.300
<v Speaker 6>Do you really think it looks like </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone who did some ways if the world </v>

1775
01:13:09.571 --> 01:13:11.410
<v Speaker 6>gets dark?</v>

<v Speaker 6>and they couldn't find it.</v>

1778
01:13:15.211 --> 01:13:17.760
<v Speaker 6>So I start tearing everything up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like looking for it.</v>

1779
01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:21.600
<v Speaker 6>That was an unintended consequence.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She seemed like she got it too.</v>

1835
01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Try to keep the handle or maybe she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>dating the other really nice cop guide </v>

1836
01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:15.860

<v Speaker 2>So every time they shoot somebody,</v>

1838
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:21.640
<v Speaker 2>that's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't shoot people down then.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit gets crazy.</v>

1840
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:25.860

<v Speaker 2>she wasn't even a real.</v>

1841
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:27.670
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a real tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was part of the mall cop.</v>

1842
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:30.640
<v Speaker 2>She was so pretty man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She knew that it was just something </v>

1845
01:15:37.861 --> 01:15:37.861
<v Speaker 2>being an idiot.</v>

1846
01:15:37.861 --> 01:15:41.100
<v Speaker 2>The guy mall cop was trying to pretend </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was a bad ass,</v>

1847
01:15:41.101 --> 01:15:42.520
<v Speaker 2>but he couldn't really keep it going </v>
<v Speaker 2>that much.</v>

1848
01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.520
<v Speaker 2>Head of security was trying to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>enforce the law,</v>

1876
01:17:04.651 --> 01:17:04.651
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time until you oppose them,</v>

<v Speaker 1>pushing this rick santorum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude on everybody.</v>

1884
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least it's not a mormon.</v>

1885
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.470
<v Speaker 1>There's been evidence of voter fraud in </v>
<v Speaker 1>main.</v>

1886
01:17:27.471 --> 01:17:32.471
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ron paul supposed to the one in Maine </v>

1887
01:17:32.471 --> 01:17:35.441
<v Speaker 1>and they were uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before even all the precincts were </v>

1888
01:17:35.441 --> 01:17:35.441
<v Speaker 1>counted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were giving it to santorum.</v>

1889
01:17:35.441 --> 01:17:36.590
<v Speaker 1>They're saying is voter fraud and made </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

1890
01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just a have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm paula when,</v>

1891
01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:41.480
<v Speaker 1>once the prelims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1892
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:43.700

<v Speaker 1>I think this whole system is rigged.</v>

1893
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Of course it is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely,</v>

1894
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:47.540
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truly believe it.</v>

1895
01:17:47.541 --> 01:17:52.541
<v Speaker 1>And I think these guys are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>auditioning to be the ceo of a company </v>

1896
01:17:52.541 --> 01:17:56.531
<v Speaker 1>or they're not even going to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance to say what the fuck gets to go </v>

1897
01:17:56.531 --> 01:17:56.531
<v Speaker 1>on and they're not going to get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

1898
01:17:56.531 --> 01:17:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Obama's gonna win again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A ball was way better than mitt romney.</v>

1899
01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.270
<v Speaker 1>He's way more charismatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can look,</v>

1900
01:18:02.271 --> 01:18:07.271
<v Speaker 1>they can do some hollywood math and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers and have you convinced that </v>

1901
01:18:07.271 --> 01:18:08.500
<v Speaker 1>we're in an epipen economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he to the rich.</v>

1902
01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came in the wrong time and the world </v>

1903
01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:14.120
<v Speaker 1>that the world was fucked up when he got</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and the country was fucked up,</v>

1904
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:19.300
<v Speaker 1>but in the time that he's been here held</v>
<v Speaker 1>spins and puking the legislation that </v>

1905
01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:21.330
<v Speaker 1>we've passed and help this and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic stimulus and a.</v>

1906
01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:26.300
<v Speaker 1>The things sort of whatever that </v>
<v Speaker 1>national defense authorization act kills</v>

1907
01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:28.190
<v Speaker 1>everything that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

1908
01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:33.670
<v Speaker 1>That's that thing that allows people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be detained indefinitely with no </v>

1909
01:18:33.670 --> 01:18:37.671
<v Speaker 1>warrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he passed that like it's </v>

1910
01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:38.240
<v Speaker 1>just such an easy way to abuse the so </v>
<v Speaker 1>gross.</v>

1911
01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:43.600
<v Speaker 1>It's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's consistently on my radio station </v>

1912
01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:43.600
<v Speaker 1>that comes on like the news about the.</v>

1913
01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:47.830
<v Speaker 1>About the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the elections have predilections </v>

1914
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:50.620
<v Speaker 1>wherever they're happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like when newt gingrich </v>

1915
01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:50.810
<v Speaker 1>and perry and santorum and all the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>mitt romney,</v>

1916
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:54.870
<v Speaker 1>it seems like to keep like just lying </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then like going back on.</v>

1917
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did say this,</v>

1918
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:58.740
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what I believe now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like a little kids thing.</v>

1919
01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Whatever they can so they can get their </v>
<v Speaker 1>prize,</v>

1920
01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's like enron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paul's and just as well,</v>

1921
01:19:04.521 --> 01:19:06.110
<v Speaker 1>this is what I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of this shit's not popular.</v>

1922
01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Give me another one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

1923
01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:13.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I've always said the same </v>

1924
01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:13.540
<v Speaker 1>thing for always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1925
01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:14.300
<v Speaker 1>When they're afraid of going on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>record for what they really believe.</v>

1926
01:19:14.301 --> 01:19:16.010
<v Speaker 1>If it's not popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

1927
01:19:16.011 --> 01:19:17.450
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just leave.</v>

1928
01:19:17.451 --> 01:19:20.360
<v Speaker 1>They want to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just trying to get elected.</v>

1929
01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:23.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you auditioned for a show</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you hope you don't get.</v>

1930
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

1931
01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:25.300
<v Speaker 1>this sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I'll put.</v>

1932
01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:28.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll make believe humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick perry is so lucky.</v>

1933
01:19:28.641 --> 01:19:33.641
<v Speaker 1>He's dumb because now he gets to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of his life without secret </v>

1934
01:19:33.641 --> 01:19:33.830
<v Speaker 1>service agents wiping his ass everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1935
01:19:33.831 --> 01:19:36.260
<v Speaker 1>because if he won and he could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking one,</v>

1936
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:41.290
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong if that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I auditioned for the role of president </v>

1937
01:19:41.290 --> 01:19:41.360
<v Speaker 1>just four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1938
01:19:41.361 --> 01:19:46.361
<v Speaker 1>And he was just coached a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and some more little hindsight </v>

1939
01:19:46.361 --> 01:19:46.361
<v Speaker 1>prepared some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It is attracting the best pr people.</v>

1941
01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.530
<v Speaker 1>He's no dumber than earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's no dumber than gw.</v>

1942
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:56.990
<v Speaker 1>It's just like an actress just to build </v>
<v Speaker 1>your resume,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's not good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not funny.</v>

2060
01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.200
<v Speaker 2>You know the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bottom line is it was created.</v>

2061
01:24:14.201 --> 01:24:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Some of it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2062
01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.360
<v Speaker 2>but that's good comedy period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2063
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Anywhere there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bottom line is the need for </v>

2064
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:25.501
<v Speaker 2>alternative comedy was created because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones who were trying to do it </v>

2065
01:24:25.501 --> 01:24:27.130
<v Speaker 2>weren't successful in other rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't successful.</v>

2066
01:24:27.370 --> 01:24:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's because they're performing </v>
<v Speaker 2>for dme crowns or whether it's </v>

2067
01:24:32.370 --> 01:24:32.380
<v Speaker 2>performing for people that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate what they were doing,</v>

2068
01:24:32.381 --> 01:24:33.670
<v Speaker 2>so they had to find people who did.</v>

2069
01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:37.570
<v Speaker 2>That's all well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they became an a lot of ways.</v>

2070
01:24:37.571 --> 01:24:42.571
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally generalizing and pigeon holing </v>

2071
01:24:42.571 --> 01:24:42.640
<v Speaker 2>irony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ironic disposition.</v>

2072
01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.080
<v Speaker 2>They also became like sort of comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullies to,</v>

2073
01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:52.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Was there.</v>

2077
01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.520
<v Speaker 2>Because when people are bullied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to bully back,</v>

<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's the robert raich who wrote it.</v>

2258
01:31:57.490 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 2>There's a widely held misconception that</v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses in California medical</v>

2259
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:02.410
<v Speaker 6>cannabis industry are prohibited from </v>
<v Speaker 6>making a profit.</v>

2260
01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:07.920
<v Speaker 6>In realiTy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no California law prohibits cannabis </v>

2261
01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.580
<v Speaker 6>related businessman for making a profit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Opponents of metal pot.</v>

2262
01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.650
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to translate as I read it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>However,</v>

2263
01:32:11.651 --> 01:32:14.980
<v Speaker 6>I've done a masterful job spreading </v>
<v Speaker 6>disinformation since sb four.</v>

2264
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.000
<v Speaker 6>20 was signed into law in 2003.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The disinformation has become so </v>

2265
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.460
<v Speaker 6>prevalent that is affecting safe access </v>
<v Speaker 6>to medical cannabis patients,</v>

2266
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.450
<v Speaker 6>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>blah,</v>

2267
01:32:22.451 --> 01:32:24.430
<v Speaker 6>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

2268
01:32:24.431 --> 01:32:26.650
<v Speaker 6>and is it resulted in state senator </v>
<v Speaker 6>john,</v>

2269
01:32:26.651 --> 01:32:29.120
<v Speaker 6>whatever releasing a letter debunking </v>
<v Speaker 6>the why,</v>

2270
01:32:29.121 --> 01:32:30.970
<v Speaker 6>the health medical reception,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that part,</v>

2271
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.030
<v Speaker 6>that profit is not permitted for medical</v>
<v Speaker 6>cannabis providers under California law.</v>

2272
01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:38.070
<v Speaker 6>Looking at brian's moth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the giant moth,</v>

2273
01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:40.630
<v Speaker 2>he smoked and just moved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Something that came out of that liquid </v>

2275
01:32:45.670 --> 01:32:47.000
<v Speaker 2>looks so trippy that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if this would do anything.</v>

2276
01:32:47.970 --> 01:32:50.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't look like a fucking poison.</v>

2277
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:54.170
<v Speaker 2>It was probably poop or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably lit it anyway.</v>

2278
01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Poison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably it.</v>

2279
01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:00.680
<v Speaker 2>You know what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably had had a miscarriage right </v>

<v Speaker 2>I bet that was pregnant.</v>

2282
01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Could be because they might look like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>for two days.</v>

2283

2305
01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.750
<v Speaker 2>but nobody would touch it.</v>

2406
01:37:39.370 --> 01:37:40.340
<v Speaker 6>what it is and the idea behind it is </v>
<v Speaker 6>great.</v>

2407
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:42.800
<v Speaker 6>The idea behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it was real,</v>

2408
01:37:42.930 --> 01:37:44.690
<v Speaker 6>god damn it,</v>

2412
01:37:55.530 --> 01:37:57.461
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's because if you really do believe </v>

2413
01:37:57.461 --> 01:37:57.461
<v Speaker 6>that there's more fulfilled guess,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then it's</v>

2414
01:37:57.461 --> 01:37:58.110
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy for you if you're happy,</v>

2415
01:37:58.111 --> 01:38:02.480
<v Speaker 1>but like she was in what she probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't happy have,</v>

2416

<v Speaker 1>that kind of wild behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fun.</v>

2420
01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.270
<v Speaker 1>If you'rE around people who think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun,</v>

2421
01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:20.690

<v Speaker 2>a social worker came that was supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to babysit him while he's with the kids </v>

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:28.480
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not supposed to have.</v>

2539
01:43:28.570 --> 01:43:30.520

01:43:30.521 --> 01:43:31.930
<v Speaker 2>pulls them,</v>

2541
01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:34.180

2544
01:43:41.431 --> 01:43:42.931
<v Speaker 2>hatchet rather blows up the house and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kills all of them because if you can't </v>

2545
01:43:42.931 --> 01:43:42.931
<v Speaker 2>have them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one can.</v>

2546
01:43:42.931 --> 01:43:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't knoW what the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lost custody.</v>

2547
01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:45.850
<v Speaker 2>He'd killed the wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He killed.</v>

2548
01:43:45.851 --> 01:43:50.851
<v Speaker 2>He had killed a white and he killed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife and he was under suspicion of it </v>

2549
01:43:50.851 --> 01:43:52.400
<v Speaker 2>and while he was under suspicion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pornography</v>

2550
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 1>questionable pornography on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

2551
01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I heard it was what it was was he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>love his wife because he had worn.</v>

2552
01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:01.100
<v Speaker 1>It was child porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was animated.</v>

2553
01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Was animated child porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

2554
01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:06.320
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think they had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is by the way,</v>

2555
01:44:06.930 --> 01:44:11.270
<v Speaker 1>the third hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>third hand information.</v>

2556
01:44:11.370 --> 01:44:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Do you have the jerry sandusky was </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to gain the right to go onto his </v>

2557
01:44:16.370 --> 01:44:16.430
<v Speaker 1>back porch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2558
01:44:16.431 --> 01:44:21.431
<v Speaker 1>he was going on his back porch and while</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was there he was looking at an </v>

2559
01:44:21.431 --> 01:44:21.431
<v Speaker 1>elementary school</v>

2560
01:44:21.431 --> 01:44:24.520
<v Speaker 6>in elementary school and that's where he</v>
<v Speaker 6>lives.</v>

2561
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.580
<v Speaker 6>So we can look at an elementary school </v>
<v Speaker 6>that wasn't even part of the beginning.</v>

2562
01:44:27.581 --> 01:44:28.720
<v Speaker 6>Part of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2563
01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:31.660
<v Speaker 1>He's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's a fucking mom.</v>

2564
01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:36.700
<v Speaker 1>He wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants a chance to see his grandkids </v>

2565
01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:36.700
<v Speaker 1>so we can have one more before it goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

2566
01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:38.210
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy that that guy got as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as taste,</v>

2567
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:40.490
<v Speaker 1>when you hear him talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's scary.</v>

2568
01:44:40.491 --> 01:44:45.491
<v Speaker 1>It's just the way he talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you attracted to children?</v>

2569
01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:50.390
<v Speaker 1>My attracted to children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how he answered that.</v>

2570
01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:53.200
<v Speaker 6>He didn't say no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2571
01:44:53.201 --> 01:44:54.070
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stop.</v>

2572
01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:54.730
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2573
01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:58.090
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I think he might be struggling with</v>

2574
01:44:58.091 --> 01:44:58.900
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>

2575
01:44:59.250 --> 01:45:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really say that.</v>

2576
01:45:01.481 --> 01:45:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Almost everybody that is in that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a situation.</v>

2577
01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got molested when they were young.</v>

2578
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how.</v>

2579
01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:09.220
<v Speaker 1>That's how those people reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that?</v>

2580
01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:12.040
<v Speaker 1>That's their method of reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy thing.</v>

2581
01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:15.190
<v Speaker 1>He's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you can imprint that into a child's</v>

2582
01:45:15.191 --> 01:45:15.700
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2583
01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's 100 percent sure the </v>
<v Speaker 1>space has moved on.</v>

2584
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:20.440
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people to get molested </v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't wind up doing that and they,</v>

2585
01:45:20.441 --> 01:45:25.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like people who are around when </v>

2586
01:45:25.441 --> 01:45:28.030
<v Speaker 1>their father beats their mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people they grow up to beat their </v>

2587
01:45:28.030 --> 01:45:28.810
<v Speaker 1>wife as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes.</v>

2588
01:45:28.811 --> 01:45:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Or if your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your parents beat you,</v>

2589
01:45:30.551 --> 01:45:33.400
<v Speaker 1>you beat your kids and some of them it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite way.</v>

2590
01:45:33.401 --> 01:45:35.920
<v Speaker 1>They liked the snow land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends if you like it.</v>

2591
01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I got molested by that </v>

2592
01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:40.940
<v Speaker 1>babysitter I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was totally and I loved it.</v>

2593
01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:41.730
<v Speaker 1>That's totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like what,</v>

2594
01:45:41.731 --> 01:45:46.731
<v Speaker 1>how will they be like 10 or 11?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was a chick and she was pretty </v>

2595
01:45:46.731 --> 01:45:49.990
<v Speaker 1>and that was fun for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a difference between a guy </v>

2596
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:52.750
<v Speaker 1>doing that to a little kid and a girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that to a little kid.</v>

2597
01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want some chick blowing my </v>

2598
01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:57.800
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2599
01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:00.811
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to come home and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hot chick is blowing a 10 year </v>

2600
01:46:00.811 --> 01:46:01.270
<v Speaker 1>old boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to see that.</v>

2601
01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:03.910
<v Speaker 1>That would be fucked up and you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to call the cops and everything.</v>

2602
01:46:03.911 --> 01:46:05.860
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be the only thing that would be</v>

2603
01:46:05.861 --> 01:46:08.290
<v Speaker 1>traumatic as the poor guy would probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in love with her.</v>

2604
01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:09.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you.</v>

2605

<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed hanging out with all the fear </v>

2630
01:47:13.961 --> 01:47:16.031
<v Speaker 1>factor people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a fucking awesome group of </v>

2631
01:47:16.031 --> 01:47:17.801
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd rather do my own thing even </v>

2632
01:47:17.801 --> 01:47:17.801
<v Speaker 1>though it was great money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hurting for money.</v>

2633
01:47:17.801 --> 01:47:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing I feel bad for you</v>

2634
01:47:18.491 --> 01:47:18.830
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2635
01:47:18.831 --> 01:47:19.610
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2636
01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:21.260
<v Speaker 1>it was fun money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>

2637
01:47:21.261 --> 01:47:23.030
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

2638
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:26.960
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy working for the ufc and doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy 100 times more.</v>

2639
01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:28.940
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was okay to do.</v>

2640
01:47:28.941 --> 01:47:33.941
<v Speaker 1>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fun to be back with all the </v>

2641
01:47:33.941 --> 01:47:35.891
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved all the people and work with </v>

2642
01:47:35.891 --> 01:47:35.891
<v Speaker 1>them again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2643
01:47:35.891 --> 01:47:38.980
<v Speaker 1>the difference between the enjoyment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you get of doing something that </v>

2644
01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:42.671
<v Speaker 1>you've really loved doing the enjoyment </v>
<v Speaker 1>was still a bad ass job as far as jobs </v>

2645
01:47:42.671 --> 01:47:42.671
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

2646
01:47:42.671 --> 01:47:44.930
<v Speaker 1>It was the fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never complain about it.</v>

2647
01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.760
<v Speaker 1>I have in the past and it sounds really </v>
<v Speaker 1>douchey.</v>

2648
01:47:46.810 --> 01:47:48.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one can really understand that.</v>

2649
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Understand that you get complacent with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2650
01:47:50.571 --> 01:47:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Like you start expecting kind of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>once you get it.</v>

2651
01:47:53.690 --> 01:47:55.820
<v Speaker 1>It was fun because the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>working with were fun.</v>

2652
01:47:55.821 --> 01:47:57.140
<v Speaker 1>And the cast of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

2653
01:47:57.141 --> 01:47:58.940

<v Speaker 1>the contestants this year were awesome.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a lot of really fucking funny people.</v>

2655
01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Really crazy people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is what it is and it's over the </v>

2656
01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:11.470
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it was hard for them to get </v>

2657
01:48:11.470 --> 01:48:11.470
<v Speaker 1>advertisers for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

2706
01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:16.010

2707
01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:21.580

<v Speaker 2>She kept saying she got high and wrote </v>

<v Speaker 2>It was a terrible report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't joe.</v>

2711
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Who is the rich girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not purity.</v>

2712
01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Blair blair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2713
01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

2714
01:50:28.970 --> 01:50:31.540
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of hot button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three words per page.</v>

2715
01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:33.670
<v Speaker 2>She was a little chubby but hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had to fight it.</v>

2716
01:50:33.671 --> 01:50:35.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they had network heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

2717
01:50:36.110 --> 01:50:40.190
<v Speaker 2>you need to eat less right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she was a good kisser probably.</v>

2718
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:43.120
<v Speaker 2>She kiss you like you ice cream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>

2719
01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:46.330
<v Speaker 2>I gotta watch that show again with with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in mind is just young,</v>

2720
01:50:46.331 --> 01:50:48.430
<v Speaker 2>young women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dirty boarding house.</v>

2721
01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:50.050
<v Speaker 2>And how much were they fucking on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>side?</v>

2722
01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Probably a bunch toward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For a woman who was in a position like </v>

2723
01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:56.620
<v Speaker 2>that where they become like super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super successful,</v>

2724
01:50:56.830 --> 01:51:01.830
<v Speaker 2>it's probably hard for them to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>mates if a woman is making a ton of </v>

2725
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:02.650
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a jennifer aniston type woman.</v>

2726
01:51:02.770 --> 01:51:04.420
<v Speaker 2>She's dating something like regular dude</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2727
01:51:04.421 --> 01:51:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't she date?</v>

2728
01:51:05.241 --> 01:51:10.241
<v Speaker 2>And some like regular guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get someone to looking at </v>

2729
01:51:10.241 --> 01:51:10.241
<v Speaker 2>you as a regular person.</v>

2730
01:51:10.241 --> 01:51:10.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time.</v>

2731
01:51:10.241 --> 01:51:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that man.</v>

2732
01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:16.020
<v Speaker 2>I think for women it's like a normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing for the man to be more successful </v>

2733
01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:16.020
<v Speaker 2>than the woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2734
01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:17.920
<v Speaker 2>And when the woman is like way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful than the man,</v>

2735
01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:19.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it gets sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2736
01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:24.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in some way to your room at some </v>

2737
01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:24.960
<v Speaker 2>of something like tennis or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2738
01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I saw a magazine with one hot chick </v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

2739
01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:30.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the 100 proof from the desperate </v>

2740
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:31.330
<v Speaker 2>housewives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one he's been superman,</v>

2741
01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:32.830
<v Speaker 2>lois and superman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2761
01:52:17.671 --> 01:52:20.980

<v Speaker 2>to over stimulate a woman like that.</v>

2762
01:52:20.981 --> 01:52:25.981

2856
01:56:32.241 --> 01:56:32.241
<v Speaker 2>maybe they changed that.</v>

2857
01:56:32.241 --> 01:56:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I hope they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though I hate cigarettes,</v>

2858
01:56:33.570 --> 01:56:36.000
<v Speaker 2>I also like personal freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2859
01:56:36.050 --> 01:56:38.220
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the one where the fringe.</v>

2860
01:56:38.230 --> 01:56:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Not other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2861
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:40.590
<v Speaker 2>so we're stinky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2862
01:56:40.591 --> 01:56:43.650
<v Speaker 2>the real issue is for work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're stinky,</v>

2863
01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:46.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about girls that smoke</v>

2864
01:56:47.010 --> 01:56:47.700
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sluttier.</v>

2865
01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:51.630
<v Speaker 2>She'll just know that they make </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions that just don't matter.</v>

2866
01:56:51.690 --> 01:56:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're crazy bitches.</v>

2867
01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:57.680
<v Speaker 2>They're throwing cigarettes out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>window and they don't even thinking </v>

2868
01:56:57.680 --> 01:56:59.010
<v Speaker 2>about where it goes in to sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The chevron addict down their mouth.</v>

2869
01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:04.100
<v Speaker 2>The loads go off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not thinking about what's going </v>

2870
01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:06.261
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not thinking about that sticky </v>

2871
01:57:06.261 --> 01:57:07.911
<v Speaker 2>dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just send out a hundred percent of </v>

2872
01:57:07.911 --> 01:57:07.911
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps your odds.</v>

2873
01:57:07.911 --> 01:57:10.950
<v Speaker 2>It increases the odds of finding a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to actually see a girl with red nail </v>

2874
01:57:11.041 --> 01:57:16.041
<v Speaker 2>polish and she's chewing gum and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>spits her gum out into the bushes and </v>

2875
01:57:16.041 --> 01:57:16.440
<v Speaker 2>then lights a cigarette.</v>

2876
01:57:16.650 --> 01:57:18.520
<v Speaker 2>That girl might suck dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2877
01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:20.850
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing later?</v>

2878
01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:25.880
<v Speaker 2>She's not thinking about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's just living for momentary little </v>

2914
01:59:00.610 --> 01:59:02.380
<v Speaker 2>When I first met her at the thickest </v>
<v Speaker 2>accent,</v>

2915

<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>But when she went home to visit it came </v>

2918
01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:14.680
<v Speaker 2>back a little stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have asked her to keep it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>want to be running shit.</v>

2923
01:59:23.330 --> 01:59:25.250
<v Speaker 2>They like to be in women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The man,</v>

2924
01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:28.960
<v Speaker 2>the areas where the men are manly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who's manlier than Texas dudes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>them the right to choose.</v>

2930
01:59:42.850 --> 01:59:46.760
<v Speaker 2>Obviously these are generalizations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generalizations.</v>

2931
01:59:46.810 --> 01:59:51.810
<v Speaker 2>We're just talking here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible for girls in Texas even </v>

2932
01:59:51.810 --> 01:59:52.540
<v Speaker 2>roll their eyes really well either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so laid back.</v>

2933
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Go to higher primate.com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're interested in monkeys and weed</v>

2934
01:59:57.941 --> 02:00:00.640
<v Speaker 2>and psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my teacher at line.</v>

2935
02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Brian's reminded me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's right and you need sales to sales </v>

2936
02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:05.700
<v Speaker 2>or coupons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>going to sell much more around for </v>

<v Speaker 2>the year every year.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's a good idea.</v>

2943
02:00:19.421 --> 02:00:21.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they had the old last year,</v>

2944
02:00:21.061 --> 02:00:22.570
<v Speaker 2>his teacher that's 50 percent off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2945
02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:27.580
<v Speaker 2>we should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should do a jo rogan experience </v>

<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2970
02:01:17.330 --> 02:01:18.100
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it called?</v>

2971
02:01:18.101 --> 02:01:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Rum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cherry rum.</v>

2972
02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

2973
02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Shirley temple with cherry rum in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so at first we called it surely </v>

2974
02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:29.500
<v Speaker 2>period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then we thought that just wouldn't </v>

2975
02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:30.130
<v Speaker 2>catch on enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he called temple of doom way.</v>

2976
02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2977
02:01:31.421 --> 02:01:32.890
<v Speaker 2>So now it's just going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2978
02:01:32.891 --> 02:01:34.250
<v Speaker 2>you know what they originally called </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2979
02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2982
02:01:40.731 --> 02:01:43.330

<v Speaker 2>about it and I guess the backbar.</v>

2983
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:47.530
