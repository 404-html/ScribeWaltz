00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience here reminded me of when you talked about grabbing them</v>

2
00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>in the laundry basket.</v>

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember back in Boston?</v>

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>You were out one night with Jennifer and I was home and I swear to God on my</v>

5
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>father's grave,</v>

6
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:14.724
<v Speaker 1>this happened.</v>

7
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>I rented Batman,</v>

8
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>the blockbuster.</v>

9
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.103
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>and I put it in and I'm sitting at home and I'm watching it.</v>

11
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.891
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

12
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden I see this shadow and then I turned my head and I see another</v>

14
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>shadow and I look up and there's a bat flying around the apartment.</v>

15
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.951
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

16
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:32.281
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

17
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:32.571
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

18
00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared shitless of bats.</v>

19
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

20
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like my thing.</v>

21
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's like ever since I was a kid,</v>

22
00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>my aunt had this barn near her and they had bats and they would be telling me</v>

23
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>they were fruit bats.</v>

24
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:44.401
<v Speaker 1>And if they bite you,</v>

25
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>you'll get rabies and you'll die.</v>

26
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.270
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

27
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

28
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>and we would always be outside playing tag at night and I would fucking,</v>

29
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>bats would fly by and I'd freak out.</v>

30
00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

31
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm alone in the apartment and as a bat flying around and Batman is on</v>

32
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:57.684
<v Speaker 1>TV.</v>

33
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

34
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>all I knew is they go in your hair,</v>

36
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>which I think is like not even true.</v>

37
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.670
<v Speaker 1>So I put on a baseball cap backwards and I had on sunglasses and a tennis</v>

38
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:08.530
<v Speaker 1>racket.</v>

39
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I didn't want to go into my eyes.</v>

40
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.643
<v Speaker 1>He's going to go for,</v>

41
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.640
<v Speaker 1>so I'm running around the apartment swinging at him and he's taken off.</v>

42
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

43
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>

45
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>they're erratic,</v>

46
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.611
<v Speaker 1>the way they fly.</v>

47
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where they're fucking going.</v>

48
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>And this goes on for like 10 minutes and then there's like a standoff and I'm</v>

49
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>waiting.</v>

50
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>And then I hear you coming up the stairs and you came in and you open the door</v>

51
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:32.400
<v Speaker 1>and you go,</v>

52
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

53
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>And I get this a bad in here.</v>

54
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.821
<v Speaker 1>And you just,</v>

55
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>you just grab the tennis racket out of my hand.</v>

56
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>And he walked up and he was in the window and you just bashed him once and he</v>

57
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>just went down.</v>

58
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>And then you just walked over and you had taken your hand and you just went into</v>

59
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 1>the kitchen and start eating it.</v>

60
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm standing there with sunglasses and I,</v>

61
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:49.644
<v Speaker 1>Ana,</v>

62
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

63
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

64
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.260
<v Speaker 1>You have to gauge at any given,</v>

65
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>in any given interaction with the audience,</v>

66
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>you gauge who that you got to fucking figure it out fast.</v>

67
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Are they gonna,</v>

68
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>are they gonna charge the stage?</v>

69
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Are they going to keep heckling or are they going to leave you?</v>

70
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Gotta you gotta tear it out.</v>

71
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Ditches and Boston's,</v>

72
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:12.480

73
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>You got an a wrestling match with wrestling match.</v>

74
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:15.211
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

75
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>the guy came up,</v>

76
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.471
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

77
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:17.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>took a swing at me.</v>

79
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.373
<v Speaker 1>I ducked,</v>

80
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I hit him in the head with a microphone.</v>

81
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>And then he was from the Israeli army.</v>

82
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>He was a cab driver who was there.</v>

83
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>His name was Simcoe.</v>

84
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I still remember that because I said,</v>

85
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:27.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>that's the name of the village,</v>

87
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>idiot and Woody Allen's movie,</v>

88
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:30.541
<v Speaker 1>love and death.</v>

89
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

90
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>And so he came up and he got me in a fucking headlock and that dude was spinning</v>

91
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>me around the stage and knocking down tables.</v>

92
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:41.060
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get out and about,</v>

93
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:41.851
<v Speaker 1>stitches.</v>

95
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:42.280
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

96
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>it's the stage is surrounded by the crowds.</v>

97
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>So of course everybody stands out cause they want to see the fight and the</v>

98
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>bouncers can't get up there.</v>

99
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>And so it just fucking went on for a while.</v>

100
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>And then finally the bouncers came up and two of my buddies,</v>

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.610
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

150
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Brian Frazier gave me the line.</v>

151
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

152
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>he was the audience.</v>

153
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.861
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

154
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:54.480
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Interesting though.</v>

158
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how fame,</v>

159
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>you can't predict who's going to last with fame.</v>

164
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:09.670

<v Speaker 1>all she did was hair shampoo commercials for the rest of her life.</v>

170
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.890

<v Speaker 1>I could stare at those chicks all fucking day.</v>

178
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.931
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

179
00:04:26.931 --> 00:04:28.640
<v Speaker 2>it's also weird that you're,</v>

180
00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:28.771
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

181
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:29.060
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

182
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.220
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda like when you watch a show like that,</v>

183
00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:32.030
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that,</v>

184
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.421
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

185
00:04:32.421 --> 00:04:32.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

186
00:04:32.631 --> 00:04:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Jaclyn smiths pretty,</v>

187
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.663
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like,</v>

188
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.170
<v Speaker 2>this is a time capsule.</v>

189
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.831
<v Speaker 2>Like this is,</v>

190
00:04:36.831 --> 00:04:41.300
<v Speaker 2>they've captured this stuff that went on in the 1970s and you'll watch it again.</v>

191
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.720
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

192
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.411
<v Speaker 2>That's weird,</v>

193
00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:42.651
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

194
00:04:42.651 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird outfit.</v>

195
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Somebody talking about the bootleg jeans,</v>

196
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.860
<v Speaker 1>they were wearing these seven date encapsulated seventies fashion.</v>

197
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

198
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:51.840
<v Speaker 1>no shit man.</v>

199
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

200
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.920
<v Speaker 1>like a denim denim vests in the feathered hair</v>

201
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 2>and they probably fall in a big part.</v>

202
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 2>We're one of the reasons why I became so popular.</v>

203
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.033
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

204
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 2>Why the fashion did,</v>

205
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure on those shows,</v>

206
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:06.064
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

207
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Like I guarantee the dukes of Hazzard probably influenced a lot of idiots to</v>

208
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 2>wear cowboy boots.</v>

209
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.433

<v Speaker 2>From fucking three's company.</v>

218
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Daisy Duke.</v>

219
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

220
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.410
<v Speaker 2>How dare you take Chrissy because you're broken.</v>

221
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Speaker 2>You're incisor rotten.</v>

222
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 2>You have to go to a doctor telling you,</v>

223
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.933
<v Speaker 2>go to a doctor.</v>

224
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Chris,</v>

225
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.991
<v Speaker 2>he's hot,</v>

226
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 2>but she's not as hot as daisy dukes.</v>

227
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 2>You know it's pretty hot even though she's,</v>

228
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.050
<v Speaker 2>she's also,</v>

229
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.860
<v Speaker 2>but she's older so you can't compare that.</v>

230
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.770
<v Speaker 2>You go for an old pick of Catherine Bach.</v>

231
00:05:39.771 --> 00:05:40.211
<v Speaker 2>You fuck,</v>

232
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:41.044
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're gonna do.</v>

233
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 2>But I'm the chick from modern family,</v>

234
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.440
<v Speaker 2>the Latino on it,</v>

235
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

236
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it.</v>

237
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

238
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.170
<v Speaker 2>she's only 40 I mean,</v>

239
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.000
<v Speaker 2>but she looks like she's 30 and her tits still look like I don't,</v>

240
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 2>you can't fake it.</v>

241
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:54.270
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

242
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 2>there is some of that cleavage.</v>

243
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 2>You can push it up,</v>

244
00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 2>but she doesn't push it up where it's straining.</v>

245
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit of bounce,</v>

246
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 2>it'll jiggle,</v>

247
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 2>but yet there's the,</v>

248
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:04.851
<v Speaker 2>there's Pie.</v>

249
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:05.661
<v Speaker 2>Their pie shaped.</v>

250
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 2>They're perfectly round.</v>

251
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 2>She's stupid Hock Tan and that accent puts it right over the top.</v>

252
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 2>She's stupid hot end.</v>

253
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.980
<v Speaker 2>There's this element of knowing that this is not going to last like what you are</v>

254
00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 2>as you're looking at a flower that's been cut and you're putting it in the vase</v>

255
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 2>and there's just like something even extra beautiful about the fact that it's</v>

256
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:24.510
<v Speaker 2>not even attached to the root anymore.</v>

257
00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 2>And you've got a day to look at it like this.</v>

258
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.250
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

259
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

260
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow's going to be wilted the day after that you're gonna want to throw it</v>

271
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.080

00:06:47.401 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 2>like who's done a better job of keeping it together?</v>

277
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

278
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 2>both of them.</v>

279
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Both of them failed.</v>

280
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.843
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

281
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 2>she did the exercise videos tight for a little bit,</v>

282
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.503
<v Speaker 2>but still doing it.</v>

283
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Shampoo commercials.</v>

284
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 2>That's not Jaclyn Smith though.</v>

285
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.650
<v Speaker 2>That's daisy Duke.</v>

286
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:04.630
<v Speaker 2>That's Catherine Bach.</v>

287
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Nobody worked at though.</v>

288
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Nipples were permanently erect on that show.</v>

289
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 2>They probably iced him up before every scene.</v>

290
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.481
<v Speaker 2>I bet they did,</v>

291
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:14.860
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

292
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 2>because guys would get like pumped up.</v>

293
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.520

333
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 2>But the nipple is very proudly displayed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Undeniable shape and all that very beautiful button right now.</v>

591
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.110
<v Speaker 2>And nothing's pulling me towards that.</v>

592
00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Everything's pushing me away from that.</v>

593
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

594
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.890
<v Speaker 2>Bet She's madness.</v>

595
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:09.820
<v Speaker 2>It's craziness.</v>

596
00:14:09.821 --> 00:14:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Like that has to be part of the picture.</v>

597
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:14.620
<v Speaker 2>It has to be who's the person?</v>

598
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Like can you interact with a person?</v>

599
00:14:16.131 --> 00:14:18.190
<v Speaker 2>It can't just be the way they look,</v>

600
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.330
<v Speaker 2>the way they look as great.</v>

601
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:20.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

602
00:14:20.141 --> 00:14:20.920
<v Speaker 2>it's important.</v>

603
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.800
<v Speaker 2>It's something,</v>

604
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.750
<v Speaker 2>it gives you a charge.</v>

605
00:14:22.751 --> 00:14:25.930
<v Speaker 2>But if you know that their personality is all out of whack,</v>

606
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.830
<v Speaker 2>like you're like,</v>

607
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:27.280
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

608
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:27.930
<v Speaker 2>this is too,</v>

609
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.260
<v Speaker 2>but I want them a little out of whack.</v>

610
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:30.820
<v Speaker 2>The thing that attracted me as a,</v>

611
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:35.140
<v Speaker 2>as an insecure guy when I was single was a woman I got,</v>

612
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:36.070
<v Speaker 2>I saw the end,</v>

613
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.820
<v Speaker 2>I saw the dad dad left or you know,</v>

614
00:14:39.821 --> 00:14:40.331
<v Speaker 2>she's got,</v>

615
00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:41.920
<v Speaker 2>she's got like a uni brow.</v>

616
00:14:41.921 --> 00:14:42.460
<v Speaker 2>You find,</v>

617
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 2>I would find that one thing and I'd be like,</v>

618
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:44.853
<v Speaker 2>I got a shot.</v>

619
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.520
<v Speaker 2>That would make me so much more attracted if a girl was perfect,</v>

620
00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 2>I felt nothing and it wasn't even that I didn't think I could get her.</v>

621
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:54.350
<v Speaker 2>It just made me feel like I work well.</v>

622
00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:54.771
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>

623
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Like somebody who's a little fucked up,</v>

624
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:56.810
<v Speaker 2>they're going to,</v>

625
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.490
<v Speaker 2>you're going to fucking connect with them.</v>

626
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.060
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a charge between you cause you both need something bad to</v>

627
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:03.020
<v Speaker 2>complete yourself.</v>

628
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:03.940
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

629
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:04.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

630
00:15:04.331 --> 00:15:05.530
<v Speaker 2>I definitely felt that way.</v>

631
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Like girls had to have really good relationships with their family.</v>

632
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:08.733
<v Speaker 2>Like man,</v>

633
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I know girls like,</v>

634
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

635
00:15:11.321 --> 00:15:12.850
<v Speaker 2>they want you to go hang out with their parents.</v>

636
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

637
00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.463
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

638
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Not really now,</v>

639
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.200
<v Speaker 2>especially if you couldn't relate.</v>

640
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.850
<v Speaker 2>I want a girl who needs help finding her father that Nicki Minaj,</v>

641
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:21.341
<v Speaker 2>Disney video.</v>

642
00:15:21.341 --> 00:15:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Do you see that's the one that fucking Jamie keeps going on and on about and</v>

643
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.360
<v Speaker 2>then stop talking about it.</v>

644
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.171
<v Speaker 2>It's so much.</v>

645
00:15:26.171 --> 00:15:27.230
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

646
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.330
<v Speaker 2>like there's parts where she's fingering herself in a video when a good kid,</v>

647
00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I love that my kids see this shit.</v>

648
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.090
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

649
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:34.361
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

650
00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:35.440
<v Speaker 2>Her ass is ridiculous.</v>

651
00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.030
<v Speaker 2>They're all ass.</v>

652
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's got an ass.</v>

653
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.471
<v Speaker 2>If you look at,</v>

654
00:15:38.471 --> 00:15:40.270
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Miley Cyrus,</v>

655
00:15:40.271 --> 00:15:41.200
<v Speaker 2>his Twitter Avatar,</v>

656
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.153
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

657
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.410
<v Speaker 2>she put her own version of her album cover on it and it looks like she has a</v>

658
00:15:47.411 --> 00:15:48.240
<v Speaker 2>great ass too,</v>

659
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.073
<v Speaker 2>but that's an illusion.</v>

660
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.280
<v Speaker 2>They're Photoshop the shit out of that girl weighs 18 pounds still.</v>

661
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.173
<v Speaker 2>Stick figure.</v>

662
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

663
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.521
<v Speaker 2>She's a very boy.</v>

664
00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Like with her body.</v>

665
00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Like when that thing came out in the video music awards and she danced around</v>

666
00:15:58.241 --> 00:15:59.340
<v Speaker 2>and rubbed up against that guy.</v>

667
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.920
<v Speaker 2>You could see like she's very like guy like or skinny.</v>

668
00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:03.980
<v Speaker 2>She's like skinny girl.</v>

669
00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Like Nicki Minaj.</v>

670
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.530
<v Speaker 2>A slick.</v>

671
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:06.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not supple.</v>

672
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

673
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.700
<v Speaker 2>that girls just a fuck house.</v>

674
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.900
<v Speaker 2>You look at her and you're like,</v>

675
00:16:13.901 --> 00:16:14.734
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

676
00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:17.483
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

677
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.380
<v Speaker 2>but I mean there's comics that go up and they're likable,</v>

678
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.920
<v Speaker 2>number one before they're funny so they can't bomb.</v>

679
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Which is the saddest thing in the world because the audience doesn't even get</v>

680
00:16:27.941 --> 00:16:28.091
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

681
00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:30.160
<v Speaker 2>They're not even that funny cause they're likable first.</v>

682
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.600
<v Speaker 2>You're not likable</v>

683
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.720
<v Speaker 2>if you do well.</v>

684
00:16:37.721 --> 00:16:39.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just cause you're funny.</v>

685
00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't argue.</v>

686
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I can argue with what you're saying.</v>

687
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.200
<v Speaker 2>I always said that if I didn't know me,</v>

688
00:16:50.201 --> 00:16:51.520
<v Speaker 2>I would swear I was a douchebag.</v>

689
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.440
<v Speaker 2>If I didn't know me,</v>

690
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.950
<v Speaker 2>if I just knew someone who had my characteristics and my jobs,</v>

691
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.010
<v Speaker 2>I left fucking most loathsome human in the world.</v>

692
00:17:00.011 --> 00:17:01.450
<v Speaker 2>I got a whiny voice.</v>

693
00:17:01.451 --> 00:17:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking,</v>

694
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.820
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm better than people.</v>

695
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh you think you're smarter than me?</v>

696
00:17:05.651 --> 00:17:05.891
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

697
00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:06.551
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

698
00:17:06.551 --> 00:17:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm a fucking idiot.</v>

699
00:17:07.481 --> 00:17:09.700
<v Speaker 2>But I seem to have that air about me.</v>

700
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.230
<v Speaker 2>But it's part of what's funny though.</v>

701
00:17:11.231 --> 00:17:13.000
<v Speaker 2>You'd know you're a real comic.</v>

702
00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Like if you and I are talking and if we just happen to be on an airplane</v>

703
00:17:16.031 --> 00:17:18.280
<v Speaker 2>together and some really dark shit was going on,</v>

704
00:17:18.281 --> 00:17:18.550
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

705
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.160
<v Speaker 2>we could start cracking each other up.</v>

706
00:17:21.161 --> 00:17:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

707
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.910
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean we mean it,</v>

708
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.270
<v Speaker 2>but you're going for the laugh.</v>

709
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.360
<v Speaker 2>You're like one of the first guys to go for the fucked up laugh.</v>

710
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Like in the personal conversation.</v>

711
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Like you're just sitting there hanging out,</v>

712
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.050
<v Speaker 2>eating lunch,</v>

713
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:34.883
<v Speaker 2>and then you just,</v>

714
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.220
<v Speaker 2>you'll go for this.</v>

715
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.530
<v Speaker 2>But you don't mean that you're a really nice guy.</v>

716
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.423
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

717
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people who aren't either immersed in the world of standup comedy</v>

718
00:17:44.841 --> 00:17:46.100
<v Speaker 2>or know a lot of standup comics,</v>

719
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they appreciate that.</v>

720
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:48.883
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

721
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:49.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

722
00:17:49.771 --> 00:17:51.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that to me it's about,</v>

723
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:51.871
<v Speaker 2>it's a gear.</v>

724
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 2>You're commenting on normal conversation.</v>

725
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.421
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

726
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:54.691
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

727
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:55.050
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

728
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.720
<v Speaker 2>you're making fun of what a racist would say it.</v>

729
00:17:57.721 --> 00:17:58.554
<v Speaker 2>And he gets,</v>

730
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

731
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.910
<v Speaker 2>and you're being racist to,</v>

732
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

733
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Also being racist was we are racist.</v>

734
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 2>Are we,</v>

735
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.420
<v Speaker 2>this is what we are.</v>

736
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

737
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.730
<v Speaker 2>We are judgmental.</v>

738
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.190
<v Speaker 2>It's part of evolution,</v>

739
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.960
<v Speaker 2>which we're constantly assessing our or environment.</v>

740
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.620
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes we know there's shit you're not supposed to say.</v>

741
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.490
<v Speaker 2>So we say it because it's funny and it's also funny because there's some truth</v>

742
00:18:20.491 --> 00:18:20.880
<v Speaker 2>to it,</v>

743
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.091
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

744
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:22.020
<v Speaker 2>And it's fucked up,</v>

745
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.070
<v Speaker 2>but there's some truth to it.</v>

746
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.761
<v Speaker 2>And God,</v>

747
00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I wish it was wasn't true.</v>

748
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.030
<v Speaker 2>I wish stereotypes weren't true.</v>

749
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:27.301
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

750
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:30.870
<v Speaker 2>We should talions I wished my own relatives were an apes.</v>

751
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.480
<v Speaker 2>I really wished they weren't savage,</v>

752
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.460
<v Speaker 2>untrustworthy apes.</v>

753
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.200
<v Speaker 2>But they are.</v>

754
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:39.470
<v Speaker 3>That's what they have to watch.</v>

755
00:18:39.471 --> 00:18:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Fucking real housewives of New Jersey.</v>

756
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.720
<v Speaker 3>And we've seen this in the Red Italian.</v>

757
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.171
<v Speaker 3>What are you seeing?</v>

758
00:18:44.171 --> 00:18:45.004
<v Speaker 3>My people,</v>

759
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.120
<v Speaker 3>my people are savages.</v>

760
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:48.470
<v Speaker 3>I wish that wasn't true,</v>

761
00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:49.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's fucking true.</v>

762
00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

763
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.591
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to,</v>

764
00:18:50.591 --> 00:18:54.340
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to fight against the Italian stereotype because here's the problem</v>

765
00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:55.150
<v Speaker 2>with Italians,</v>

766
00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:56.050
<v Speaker 2>that there's many,</v>

767
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.440
<v Speaker 2>is that you're enamored with the fact that you're Italian,</v>

768
00:18:59.441 --> 00:19:00.700
<v Speaker 2>so you won't evolve.</v>

769
00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Like every Italian guy,</v>

770
00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.050
<v Speaker 2>you could meet some guy from fucking the a prairie,</v>

771
00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.760
<v Speaker 2>prairie land Midwest,</v>

772
00:19:06.761 --> 00:19:07.750
<v Speaker 2>and if he's Italian,</v>

773
00:19:07.751 --> 00:19:09.100
<v Speaker 2>he'll go and get the</v>

774
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.480
<v Speaker 3>pause to fuzzy because they've watched the godfather.</v>

775
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

776
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:16.680
<v Speaker 2>they've watched sopranos and they want to sound like that and because they want</v>

777
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:17.610
<v Speaker 2>to be Italian,</v>

778
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.370
<v Speaker 2>whereas we're supposed to be all growing away from,</v>

779
00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:21.204
<v Speaker 2>like you're saying,</v>

780
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.720
<v Speaker 2>the barbaric versions of ourselves should be in the past,</v>

781
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.850
<v Speaker 2>not perpetuated for generations.</v>

782
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.830
<v Speaker 2>I have friends that are back east friends.</v>

783
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I love him to death and I don't mind when they put it on.</v>

784
00:19:31.531 --> 00:19:33.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind when they do the Italian talk,</v>

785
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.370
<v Speaker 2>a little piece of me dies.</v>

786

<v Speaker 2>I'm Irish.</v>

790
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.213
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

791
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.551
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

792
00:19:41.551 --> 00:19:43.500

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.673
<v Speaker 2>epi.</v>

794

<v Speaker 2>Some.</v>

795
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:46.240
<v Speaker 2>They'll call me Giuseppe.</v>

796
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.103
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>

797
00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.270
<v Speaker 2>Hey Giuseppe.</v>

798
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Very rare that that my Jewish friends call me Giuseppe if it might be already</v>

799
00:19:52.601 --> 00:19:53.210
<v Speaker 2>when he was high,</v>

800
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.170
<v Speaker 2>but I've never seen an Italian guy have a solo fight.</v>

801
00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.810
<v Speaker 2>It's always a fucking group jumps in.</v>

802
00:19:59.620 --> 00:19:59.921
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

803
00:19:59.921 --> 00:20:03.880
<v Speaker 2>there's a herd mentality involved and being proud of what patch of dirt you're</v>

804
00:20:03.881 --> 00:20:04.151
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

805
00:20:04.151 --> 00:20:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

806
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.250
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't lend itself to courage.</v>

807
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

808
00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:07.540

809
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.920
<v Speaker 2>that's not the right mentality.</v>

810
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.400
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

811
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.130
<v Speaker 2>the rugged individual that takes on the group and wins.</v>

812
00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:12.881
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Really think we came to America at the time of the Italians came at basically</v>

881
00:21:54.131 --> 00:21:54.970
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>

882
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.550
<v Speaker 2>So when you go to the Bronx or Boston,</v>

883
00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.720
<v Speaker 2>they're so sweet.</v>

884
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.050
<v Speaker 2>They fucking hate each other and they hate everybody else because we were the</v>

885
00:22:02.051 --> 00:22:03.220
<v Speaker 2>last ones to come over.</v>

886
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:04.720
<v Speaker 2>So everybody hated us.</v>

887
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.940
<v Speaker 2>We were the last ones to get jobs.</v>

888
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:07.931
<v Speaker 2>So we have to,</v>

889
00:22:07.931 --> 00:22:08.230
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

890
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.720
<v Speaker 2>the Irish were the last to the first,</v>

891
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.310
<v Speaker 2>the first immigrants,</v>

892
00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.420
<v Speaker 2>English to Dutch,</v>

893
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Dutch,</v>

894
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.553
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>

895
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Dutch,</v>

896
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:15.820
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>

897
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.151
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

898
00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:16.984
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

899
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:17.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

900
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.670
<v Speaker 2>you Scandinavians,</v>

901
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.060
<v Speaker 2>I know so little about the immigration of different cultures in this country.</v>

902
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Always know about my own family.</v>

903
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:24.890
<v Speaker 2>It was the great depression.</v>

904
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.980
<v Speaker 2>My grandparents came over during the depression.</v>

905
00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:31.360
<v Speaker 2>This is a great book about Cornelius Vanderbilt and it kind of tracks New York</v>

906
00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:32.290
<v Speaker 2>in the 18 hundreds.</v>

907
00:22:32.291 --> 00:22:34.810
<v Speaker 2>And as the waves of people came over and,</v>

908
00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:34.991
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

909
00:22:34.991 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 2>it's really a won the Pulitzer prize called the first tycoon.</v>

910
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:40.721
<v Speaker 2>My Grandmother,</v>

911
00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:41.500
<v Speaker 2>the last tycoon,</v>

912
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.330
<v Speaker 2>my grandmother grew up in the depression.</v>

913
00:22:43.331 --> 00:22:45.280
<v Speaker 2>She was kind of insane because of it.</v>

914
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.160
<v Speaker 2>And she's still like hide things all around the house.</v>

915
00:22:48.161 --> 00:22:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Like she hide money in various spots in the house.</v>

916
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.810
<v Speaker 2>They didn't find it until after she died.</v>

917
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.003
<v Speaker 2>They would shit,</v>

918
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:54.900
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

919
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Thousands of dollars talk to any walls.</v>

920
00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.090
<v Speaker 2>But it's just,</v>

921
00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.310
<v Speaker 2>but the idea was not just that she had money.</v>

922
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.091
<v Speaker 2>I mean she,</v>

923
00:23:01.091 --> 00:23:02.050
<v Speaker 2>they were very poor,</v>

924
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:07.530
<v Speaker 2>but that she had money that she had squirreled away in to these weird spots all</v>

925
00:23:08.201 --> 00:23:09.070
<v Speaker 2>over their house.</v>

926
00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

927
00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.600
<v Speaker 2>It was really weird.</v>

928
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I did you almost not find it before you,</v>

929
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:12.521
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

930
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have anything to do with it.</v>

931
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:14.141
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

932
00:23:14.141 --> 00:23:16.010
<v Speaker 2>his children did the,</v>

933
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:16.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

934
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:16.890
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

935
00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:17.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

936
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:17.570
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

937
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.730
<v Speaker 2>when my grandfather died,</v>

938
00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.950
<v Speaker 2>I was over here and I think that's when they,</v>

939
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:21.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

940
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.330
<v Speaker 2>they started searching the house.</v>

941
00:23:22.331 --> 00:23:23.770
<v Speaker 2>The people that were living in New Jersey,</v>

942
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:24.430
<v Speaker 2>they had it,</v>

943
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.620
<v Speaker 2>they had some idea that she was like,</v>

944
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

945
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:27.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

946
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.151
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know him.</v>

947
00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:28.401
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

948
00:23:28.401 --> 00:23:29.320
<v Speaker 2>she had this,</v>

949
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.280
<v Speaker 2>she had had an aneurysm and she was sick for a long time because of it.</v>

950
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.310
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

951
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

952
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.201
<v Speaker 2>during that time,</v>

953
00:23:35.201 --> 00:23:37.540
<v Speaker 2>my grandfather took care of her and my grandfather took care of her.</v>

954
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:38.740
<v Speaker 2>That's when I was staying with him.</v>

955
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.400
<v Speaker 2>And it was a very fascinating time in my life because,</v>

956
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

957
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I had left Boston and I moved to New York,</v>

958
00:23:46.221 --> 00:23:48.290
<v Speaker 2>but I couldn't really afford to live in New York.</v>

959
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.910
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know I had hardly any money.</v>

960
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.530
<v Speaker 2>So stated my grandfather,</v>

961
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:53.450
<v Speaker 2>who was living on North Ninth Street,</v>

962
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.850
<v Speaker 2>which was a really bad neighborhood in Newark,</v>

963
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:56.931
<v Speaker 2>the next door neighbor,</v>

00:24:05.991 --> 00:24:07.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a shitty spot.</v>

969
00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

971
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:13.520
<v Speaker 2>grandfather and my grandmother.</v>

972
00:24:13.521 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 2>It was like one of the lowest points in my life.</v>

973
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:17.930
<v Speaker 2>I had just broken up with my girlfriend.</v>

974
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.680
<v Speaker 2>I had just torn my ACL and I knew that I needed surgery.</v>

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.270
<v Speaker 2>I just moved to New York.</v>
