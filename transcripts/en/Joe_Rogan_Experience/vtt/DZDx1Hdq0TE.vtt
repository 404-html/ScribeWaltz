<v Speaker 1>But it was true.</v>

9
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of lost my virginity when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was 18 years old to a girl,</v>

10
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:37.731
<v Speaker 1>a prostitute and a in Tijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico who was overweight and her teeth</v>

11
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>had no general direction or color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was well within my budget</v>

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.840
<v Speaker 1>but I got stationed at Pearl and if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>found that after a while when she'd been</v>

13
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>on a one part of Awahoo wasn't hotel st</v>
<v Speaker 1>these really cute girls jumping your car</v>

14
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>and blow you for $5.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like the best deal I've ever</v>

15
00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>even heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

16
00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're twice a day,</v>

17
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

18
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I was there for eight months and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months ago I was watching this</v>

19
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>documentary on transvestites and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>started talking about the transvestite</v>

20
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>scene on hotel street on a wall who had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been there for 55 years.</v>

21
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

22
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.640

<v Speaker 1>What's the record before you find out?</v>

24
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Right when I went to record is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

25
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>but God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to be close.</v>

26
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've dodged that bullet,</v>

27
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>but I've come close a gang of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've dodged a bullet.</v>

28
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

29
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>if I had to dodge the bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kudos.</v>

30
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Whenever thing pretended to be her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently it tongue is a tongue and the</v>

31
00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>tooth is the tooth because you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell man,</v>

32
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>man from woman mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

33
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>if it would have been a hand job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been going,</v>

34
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a plumber dude.</v>

35

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.210

<v Speaker 1>has a Dick probably knows how to work</v>

38
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:59.970

<v Speaker 1>twice a day.</v>

40
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Forty five seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in my little dots and headed back</v>

41
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>to the ship.</v>

<v Speaker 1>as dude,</v>

44
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my mind that I don't let myself go</v>
