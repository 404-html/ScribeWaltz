1
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.040
Boom and we're alive.
Russell,

2
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.650
why is it then when people start getting like super spiritual,

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.100
they start dressing like you.
You dress like a guru.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.990
We sat key lay a memo so it's now time has stopped wearing socks,

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.890
stopped shaving and make eye contact for a bit too long.

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.630
Oh it uncomfortable.
Stary how long are you going to go with the beard?

7
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:28.830
I mean that's,
that's like you're,
you're full on like you're a Yogi now.

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.860
I mean it's gone be on Jesus and Moses and lesser profits or test or a navy

9
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:38.180
seal.
You are in that range to like you could be some wild man.
That's,

10
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.330
that's a mistake that wouldn't like if there was an assault course in front of

11
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:45.840
us that have the potential for me being a navy seal would start to break down.

12
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:47.910
I once went on a an assault course.

13
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.240
We have some US marines in that place near San Diego.

14
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.740
I can't remember the name of that base and climbing up that rope using your leg

15
00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:58.500
muscles.
It was not good value and enjoy it.

16
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.220
I like the camaraderie and I'd really like I as I've written about and talked

17
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:08.040
about quite a lot when I'm around very in very male environment,

18
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.890
I kind of really like it.
I really get off on it,

19
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.370
but I have to watch myself not getting too excitable.

20
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.830
It's even in this environment.
As a matter of fact,

21
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:20.430
I have to keep myself a little bit chilled out.
Why?
What do you mean?

22
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:23.460
What does it do to you?
Well,
I guess what it is is my early life,

23
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:27.360
I grew up mostly around my mum and dad have brothers and sisters and stuff like

24
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:27.571
that,

25
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:32.550
so my male role modeling occurred later in life and I think it probably relates

26
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.890
to the spiritual thing.
I think it meant that I was,

27
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.270
I'm very open to sort of spiritual experience,
meditative experience,

28
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:43.260
so I didn't have a lot of grounding physical experiences or bodily experience.

29
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:47.100
He's really till adolescents until sex and sexuality as a first time I really

30
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.680
sort of got into the body,
didn't do sport as a kid,
didn't have like main guy,

31
00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:53.550
right.
This is what we do,
this is how we shave.
This is how you treat people.
This,

32
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.360
you know,
I didn't really get that kind of education.
So now steel,

33
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:01.380
if I'm around like soldiers,
UFC fight as I go,
you know,
you know,

34
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:05.940
I'd be BJJ primarily as a result of these conference where there's not Colum

35
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:09.780
confrontation counselors conversations.
That's a much nicer term.

36
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.460
So like there's a bit of me that's the guy gave excited about the analysis of
it.

37
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.630
It's not homoerotic because that doesn't happen to be the way that I roll out.

38
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.620
Just enjoy a little too much.
There's something about it.
Yeah.

39
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.510
And it may well what's bad about it?
What's,
what's bad about getting fired up?

40
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.030
Nothing for me.
I except like,
you know,
look my,
as you know,

41
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.470
my model for life is as sort of a 12 step model about watching my impulses.

42
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.470
My impulses of got me in a lot of trouble.
My impulse is to take drugs.

43
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:45.120
My impulse is to sleep around my,
like my impulse is to even eat food.

44
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.080
I've got a sort of a tendency to get obsessive.
But you know,

45
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.140
you would probably argue that if you direct that energy correctly,

46
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:54.750
it can be kind of positive.
I think it can,

47
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:58.740
but I agree with you that it can get out of control and I have similar impulses,

48
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.770
I have problems and I've just used disciplined and hard work,

49
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.010
especially working out to try to mitigate it.

50
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.490
Well that's why I pick up from you is that your early encounters with Marsha,

51
00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:13.780
lots of men that you've understood from a young age.

52
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:18.070
It seems to me physical discipline and I think that's a very important thing.

53
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:23.071
And I'm only learning that like now because I've had a like,

54
00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:23.321
you know,

55
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:28.321
drugs then fame there and chaos and I've only just a merge from like the sort of

56
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:32.170
the fog of that madness.
I love how you have emerged though,

57
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.880
cause it's very unique.
You've,
you,
you've uniquely emerged authentically.

58
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.620
Like you've,
this is who you really are.

59
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:41.530
Like you're not putting on an act you found yourself,

60
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.290
which is like what everybody wants to do.
They want to find themselves.

61
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.470
I mean it never feels like a completed task,
right?
It.

62
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.100
Everyone's a work in progress forever.
That's why,
but you are,

63
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:56.101
you like you are very comfortably you and you've found what makes you you.

64
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.690
That's a lovely compliment to get from you,
Joe.

65
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.540
I appreciate that because what I think about is like you're a very different

66
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:05.560
type of person.
To me it things that in this world,
in these political times,

67
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.450
you and I would be supposed to,

68
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.930
I would say a take adversarial stance is on,

69
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.560
I'm Vegan now you love hunting,

70
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.770
but my personal philosophy is my morality and my spirituality is for me.

71
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.220
It's not something I go around,

72
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:24.100
inflict it on other people and telling them how they should behave.

73
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:28.030
I I know enough now to know people are different people at different experiences

74
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.200
and I don't let those things get in the way of how I evaluate other people or we

75
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:34.600
should all be more like that.
I really,
I really believe that.

76
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.630
I mean there's so many people that or disagree with that I have fun

77
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:40.120
conversations with.
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

78
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:44.800
And then I don't think that impulse to to have antagonistic engagements with

79
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:48.190
people that you disagree with is correct.
How else are we going to consolidate?

80
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.280
Like it's just like I'm only going to deal with people that see the world

81
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:55.480
roughly how I do.
How are we going to form new tribes,
new alliances,

82
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:56.201
new relationships,

83
00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:59.590
new system at a time when evidentaly it feels to me at least Joe,

84
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:03.210
like things are breaking down.
There's a lot of bitterness,

85
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.520
a Serby and confrontation and people don't want to talk to you.
But I mean,

86
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:08.980
I don't know how real that is of actual people.
I'm talking,

87
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:13.120
I suppose about how the media landscape seems to present information.

88
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:14.850
I don't know if that's true when you're,
you know,

89
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.770
when I'm around people I don't sense,
oh wow,

90
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:20.390
these guys are really tied up in Brexit or Trump or whatever.

91
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.410
It doesn't seem that relevant toward an airy people.

92
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.000
It seems to me that people are still operating on a,
in a personal,

93
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.330
how are you today?
You look at,
you know,

94
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.310
people that are willing to get on like that.
I mean,
how,

95
00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:33.310
how are we supposed to take these ideas on board?

96
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.170
It's sort of almost too vast for us.

97
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.680
Geopolitical ideas that we were asked to identify with.
Right.

98
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:43.060
And then your everyday life hardly ever affects you or affects you very little

99
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:46.900
in comparison to things that you ignore because you're concentrating on Brexit

100
00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:50.260
or are you concentrating on Trump or you're concentrating on whatever it is?

101
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.030
Yeah.
That wall build that wall,
whatever it is.
Yeah.

102
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.070
I start to wonder who is it that's involved in this stuff?

103
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.130
I started at what it's,

104
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.400
where I'm at now is all we even capable of belonging to groups,

105
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.871
units,

106
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:10.871
tribes of free hundred million people or 60 million people with so many diverse

107
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:16.700
ideas.
Is this a time to look at federalism differently to start breaking down?

108
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.310
Well,
you know the,
I exist within this tribe of people,

109
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:21.530
but I collaborate with all these other people.

110
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:24.680
I don't know how municipal action gets done and now you run an army and build

111
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:27.290
roads if people are starting to operate in smaller units.

112
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:32.291
But I am thinking that we need to have a real sense of community and connection

113
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:37.220
and we've got to let go of looking for ways to object to and judge other people

114
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.950
is some sort of primary fault way of forming our own identity.
No,

115
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.480
I completely agree and I think we're probably moving towards some sort of

116
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:49.481
understanding that a lot of these boundaries and these clans of,

117
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.380
you know,
states and countries,

118
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.430
they were all established without our consent before we're born and we're,

119
00:06:55.431 --> 00:07:00.170
we're just,
we're a part of a system that we just were,
we didn't agree to it.

120
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.100
We just all of a sudden found ourselves in it and we're trying to make it fit
us.

121
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.210
Yeah,
that's right.
And there's aspects of it that are appealing,
you know,

122
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:13.211
like sort of [inaudible] a world cop I've really sure English and know like I

123
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:16.940
feel a genuine sense of connection and investment.

124
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.360
But if I'm being asked to live according to rules that don't affect me,

125
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:24.320
that affect except for you know,

126
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.290
that for affect me financially and don't speak to I am as an individual.

127
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:32.200
Then I'm like,
well what is this?
This is it for my benefit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

128
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.270
When the inclination to form teams and to root for your team and a root against

129
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:42.260
other teams,
it's a,
it's so deep seated in us.
It's a,

130
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:47.270
and it can cause so many unnecessary conflicts for no reason.
It's just,

131
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:51.580
it's,
it's so,
it's so escapable too.
It's,
it's some,

132
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.510
so if you can objectively analyze the way human beings behave and interact with

133
00:07:56.511 --> 00:07:59.990
each other and go,
well why do we do this?
Let's just stop doing that.
Which is to,

134
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.370
if we disagree on things,

135
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:05.780
how much are these disagreements actually affecting me on a daily basis.
Dot.

136
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:09.890
That much.
Can we just communicate?
Can someone say what they think?

137
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:14.390
And I say what I think and we just decide like what makes sense and what doesn't

138
00:08:14.391 --> 00:08:17.300
make sense based on our own interpretations.
Cause isn't that possible?

139
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.470
It seems like it's,
that's the direction we'd go ahead.
And I did a,

140
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:25.430
as I know you have done a podcast with Candice Olin's who like on the subject

141
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:26.480
of,
you know,

142
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.680
individual like when she says stuff like that people should get over slavery or

143
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:32.840
it's as if it didn't happen.
I don't agree with that.

144
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.120
I feel like that has a massive social impact.

145
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:37.400
That is that those statistics are not coming incidents,

146
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:41.570
the number of people or certain ethnicities in prisons and in poverty or

147
00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:45.050
wherever.
For me,
that's not just the coincidence,
but as I said,

148
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.940
I couldn't agree with more profoundly on according to social criteria,
some very,

149
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:53.210
very important issues on an interpersonal level of which she was absolutely

150
00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:55.980
delightful,
but like sort of funny and sweet

151
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.400
<v 1>and she's</v>

152
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.233
<v 2>very young.</v>

153
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.530
If you really start the things that what's going on only 28 which is amazing.

154
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.840
Right?
Is that correct?

155
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.220
She's so much smarter than I was when I was 28 she sent me a lot more competent

156
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:11.610
and that was 29 28 or 29 same thing.

157
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.360
So when I was 29 I was a fucking moron.
Okay.

158
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:18.220
And no one would ever listen to my opinions on anything and on,

159
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.450
on the world stage.
People are listening to her.
I mean she's,

160
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.210
she's testifying in front of Congress.
I mean she's,

161
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.500
so I cut her a lot of slack with some of the things that she's made,

162
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.170
like misstep,

163
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.330
stepson that I think sometimes when people say those things like people should

164
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:34.680
get over slavery.
It's like,

165
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.690
it's almost like you're saying things that you think other people want to hear

166
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.840
more than you're saying things that are really rational.

167
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.760
So whether or not we should get over slavery.
Sure.

168
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:48.450
Slavery was over more than a hundred years ago,
but the repercussions of slavery,

169
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.440
the echoes of slavery still exists and they exist in all these different

170
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:56.220
southern states and cities and all these different neighborhoods that had been a

171
00:09:56.221 --> 00:10:01.110
part of systemic racism where they had literally forced black people to live in

172
00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:06.111
certain areas and didn't even allow them to buy homes outside of those areas.

173
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.410
They made laws and those laws are in place in places like Baltimore.

174
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:11.190
And you know,

175
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:15.510
I had this Guy Michael Wood on [inaudible] who was a police officer and the city

176
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:15.961
of Baltimore.

177
00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:20.910
And one of the more profound things that he said was that they found papers that

178
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:25.911
we're documenting crimes from the 1970s in Baltimore and they were in this same

179
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:26.910
area,

180
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:31.230
the same crimes that he was facing in the two thousands when he was a police

181
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:35.010
officer.
So he was looking at this going,
what in the fuck?
Like this is,

182
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.910
am I just a part of something that's never going to be fixed and never going to

183
00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:40.530
be changed?
And you know,

184
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:45.270
as he learned more about the city and the city's laws and how these,

185
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.360
these systems were set up to keep people in certain places and how the crime and

186
00:10:51.841 --> 00:10:55.200
the violence and the drugs is all just in this one concentrated area and it's

187
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:59.340
always been there and no one does anything to change it.
You realize like,
wow,

188
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:03.420
this is a,
this is a crazy echo of a horrible past.
And that's what it is.

189
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.190
<v 1>I had a couple of conversations that made me recognize how powerful systems and</v>

190
00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:11.880
institutions are and their ability to maintain themselves.

191
00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.090
It regardless of any individual cause it seems like what happened there with the

192
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:18.390
man you are chatting to is that he's an individual woke up and like,
oh my God,

193
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:19.224
hold on a second.

194
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.460
In some sort of weird grid and like I spoke to his fellow called Ken Ross who

195
00:11:23.461 --> 00:11:28.461
worked for the British diplomatic service at the time of nine 11 and was privy

196
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:31.950
to confidential information about how that was handled on a military and

197
00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:36.390
geopolitical level and he said like he's come away from that thinking,

198
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:40.860
well these institutions function and in a totally corrupt way to pursue their

199
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:41.660
own objectives.

200
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.090
This ingenuity and dishonesty is just part of the system and it was him that

201
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:48.480
made me think about antiques ism in a different way.
Saying that people,

202
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.130
the assumption that people,

203
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.550
if they were not tightly governed with big government and huge control would go

204
00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:58.120
around merger in each of them raping each other simply not true.

205
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:02.200
That's one of the means by which the state continues to justify its existence.

206
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:07.470
People will behave better the closer they are to self governing community self

207
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:09.430
governing committee and they sit light.

208
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:11.380
And I was interested in that because he's talking from,

209
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.030
this is why a sore on the inside,

210
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.450
this is how I saw it was running like your cop friend there and like,
uh,

211
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.980
another person I spoke to that had been inside the system and then woken up

212
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.850
within it,
he was like,
oh,
you have Yanis Varoufakis he was,

213
00:12:26.851 --> 00:12:30.250
when Greece had that mad revolution,
he was like one of the leaves of a party.

214
00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.700
Syriza and for a minute it was like the reason I said,

215
00:12:32.701 --> 00:12:35.530
we ain't paying back all those debts.
You screwed us financially.

216
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:36.430
You've screwed Greece.

217
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:41.230
So he was there at the EU means telling like the German chancellery,

218
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.840
we're not Paris,
Greece ain't gonna repay those debts.

219
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.730
And he just said that the way that the system reassert itself was magnificent to

220
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:49.780
watch in a way.
And he said,

221
00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:53.380
none of those individuals have any power except the power that that role gives

222
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:56.440
them.
If you are the German finance minister,

223
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.840
you've got the power of the German finance minister has,

224
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:00.810
you can't step outside it and start going,
right,
listen,

225
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.140
why don't we do this and why don't we do that?

226
00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:06.480
The system itself is beyond individual decisions.
You know it's,

227
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.290
it's a self sustaining system.

228
00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:12.670
It won't come up with ideas or support ideas that threaten it and that's why I

229
00:13:12.671 --> 00:13:15.640
continue to keep hearing and I'm sure you're having similar conversations that

230
00:13:15.641 --> 00:13:17.530
if you are really interested in changing the world,

231
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:21.460
you have to participate in systems that are outside of it.
Set up new ideas.

232
00:13:21.461 --> 00:13:23.950
Don't worry about trying to smash this one down with a hammer.

233
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.790
It will atrophy on its own as it becomes less and less relevant.

234
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.870
I think also change yourself and when you change yourself becomes evident to the

235
00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:32.860
people around you.

236
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:38.050
And if your change is beneficial and attractive people,

237
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:42.910
they gravitate towards that idea that you can improve yourself and you can

238
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.040
change your perspective on things.

239
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:49.390
Well that is the one area of your life where you've got some are for it in

240
00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:51.040
control.
And that's the,

241
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:56.070
that is what I'm about is like the y can stop myself being like,

242
00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:01.150
uh,
watching pornography.
I can stop myself using drugs if I want to.
Like,

243
00:14:01.151 --> 00:14:01.391
you know,

244
00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:04.810
we have some support and that's what that this book here mentors which are

245
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:07.930
talking about you in early for paragraph,
you know what I mean?
It's not too,

246
00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:12.931
it's not like a like literary fellatio it's a small knot of your uh,

247
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:14.920
of your influence and impact.

248
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.610
I talk about how we have latent latent qualities within us that are sometimes

249
00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:24.700
hard to realize on,
on without support.

250
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.320
But if you find a mentor in an area where you're looking to improve,

251
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.200
they can kind of energize,

252
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:37.210
awaken energies within you that on your own you wouldn't be able to use.

253
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.570
I had a really reasoned experience of it where I was sort of like freaking out

254
00:14:40.571 --> 00:14:43.360
about something I spoke to like a men or of mine.

255
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:47.320
And like the way that you sort of spoke to me was like sort of aggressive,

256
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.510
like at a sort of an aggressive,
that's not going to happen.

257
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:51.170
You are not afraid and like it's sort of,

258
00:14:51.171 --> 00:14:55.430
it woke up the part of me that's feels that way,
that has that kind of,

259
00:14:55.431 --> 00:15:00.431
I would say sort of a male certainty are kind of grounded energy.

260
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.750
He was able to sort of like the rectory at me and like in that moment in myself

261
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.170
or bewildered,
I wasn't able to do it,
you know,

262
00:15:07.171 --> 00:15:09.680
a needed to resource it externally in a moment.

263
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.430
So this is how I sort of feel like your individual journey.

264
00:15:13.431 --> 00:15:14.810
I'm interested in how,

265
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.690
because I'm guessing with your background in martial arts and stuff,

266
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:21.380
men or ships seems pretty much stitched into that you must continually be

267
00:15:21.381 --> 00:15:26.030
looking at someone learning from someone,
trying to equal them or whatever it is.

268
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.400
<v 2>Yeah.
The good part about that,</v>

269
00:15:27.401 --> 00:15:31.080
as you get good at learning things and you get good at listening,
you know,
uh,

270
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.980
as a martial arts student,
you,
you don't just listen,
you listen very intently.

271
00:15:35.981 --> 00:15:39.040
You bow,
you say,
sir,
you know,
I mean there's a,

272
00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:43.380
there's so much discipline involved in the,
the,

273
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.800
the act of learning and so much reverence and respect for people know more than

274
00:15:47.801 --> 00:15:50.110
you and appreciation.
So,
uh,
that,

275
00:15:50.111 --> 00:15:52.570
that helped me with pretty much everything I ever wanted to learn.

276
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.430
I just would listen very intently and I don't think,
oh,

277
00:15:55.431 --> 00:15:57.430
maybe I could figure it out better.
I will.

278
00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.460
I'm very good at listening to people that are good at things.
Fast

279
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.200
<v 1>chest in Digi first,
get into,
uh,
like,
you know,</v>

280
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:08.590
I've picked up stuff over the various shows of yours that I've listened to,

281
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:13.620
but would you say that your inaugural interest in martial arts came from kind of

282
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.270
domestic distress and stuff like that,
but a difficult home life and,

283
00:16:18.271 --> 00:16:20.050
and not a good relationship with your stepdad and my right.

284
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.620
<v 2>That was there,
but it was,
it was also moved moving more than anything.</v>

285
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.470
You know what I missed up?
Does a nice guy.
Um,
but it was stepped out.

286
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.210
It's always a weird situation.
You know?

287
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.910
<v 1>No one likes the dynamic of someone having sex with their mother.</v>

288
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.450
I remember similar feelings about my own step.
That one

289
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.940
<v 2>great guy though.
I don't want to like,
no,
of course I'm in a bad way.</v>

290
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.080
It's just what it was really hard was moving a lot and running into bullies.

291
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.820
That was way harder than anything else.

292
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.830
<v 1>So there was a time in your life where you felt very uh,</v>

293
00:16:49.831 --> 00:16:52.230
presumably vulnerable and not grounded,

294
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.110
<v 2>didn't have any friends constantly moving in new neighborhoods,</v>

295
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:59.370
meeting New People and uh,
you know,
and when you were a young boy,

296
00:16:59.371 --> 00:17:03.480
you're a teenage boy.
Teenage boys are fucking dangerous.
And it was the worst

297
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.671
<v 1>group of them.</v>

298
00:17:04.671 --> 00:17:09.110
Now I am talking about my country for in 14 years old are across the street.

299
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.750
<v 2>Yeah.
Eh Lord this well,
young boys are just,</v>

300
00:17:12.751 --> 00:17:15.810
they're always looking to impress each other and they have these,

301
00:17:15.811 --> 00:17:20.580
if you want to find real toxic masculinity,
it exists in teenage boys,

302
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.800
you know,
and it's mostly saturated,
didn't men,

303
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.450
the way it's described is mostly exaggerated in terms of the way the media talks

304
00:17:27.451 --> 00:17:29.940
about it,
but in its purest form and teenage boys,

305
00:17:29.941 --> 00:17:33.270
they get together and they start light and frogs on fire.
And doing shit.

306
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:37.320
They do things because they want to like one up each other and they feed off of

307
00:17:37.321 --> 00:17:38.154
each other.

308
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.020
Like what one boy would do is so different than what five boys would do,

309
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.430
what five boys would do,

310
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.340
who could be horrific but with one boy would do on his own.

311
00:17:47.341 --> 00:17:49.670
It's very rarely there of what you know.

312
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.260
You have to think about yourself and think about is this right?

313
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:56.960
And you objectively analyze the way you're behaving.
And I'm like,
um,

314
00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.220
yeah,
and people wouldn't be proud of me if I did it this way.

315
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.510
When you're with five other boys and you're all rambunctious and filled with

316
00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:07.200
testosterone and piss and vinegar,
you wind up doing crazy things.

317
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.910
<v 1>This is I,
you know,
when I hear something like that,</v>

318
00:18:09.911 --> 00:18:13.870
it's difficult not to think that it's,
of course relative relative to us,

319
00:18:13.871 --> 00:18:17.650
the behavior of adolescent mouse is reckless and crazy.

320
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.820
It's not impossible to conceive of an intelligent that would look at the

321
00:18:21.821 --> 00:18:25.180
behavior of adult human beings and think,
oh my God,

322
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:30.100
all governing these people.
What principals,
so they using right now

323
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.740
<v 2>goal two.
Like,
what are you trying to accomplish with your life,</v>

324
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:37.700
with your existence,
with your time?
I think if there's a real concern about Ai,

325
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:43.070
I think the real concern is AI is going to rationally analyze our behavior and

326
00:18:43.071 --> 00:18:48.071
our reliance on emotions and all these human reward systems that we have built

327
00:18:48.831 --> 00:18:52.790
in the way it's affecting our society and the way it's affecting how we govern

328
00:18:52.791 --> 00:18:55.490
ourselves and how we behave amongst ourselves.

329
00:18:55.491 --> 00:18:59.570
And it's going to think we're unfixable.
It's going to look at it and like,
well,

330
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.670
this is,
they have too much monkey in them.

331
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.970
They have so much monkey instincts and monkey DNA.

332
00:19:04.971 --> 00:19:09.120
But now they live in this rational,
modern world of,
you know,

333
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:14.350
five g internet on your phone and satellite communication and 24,

334
00:19:14.481 --> 00:19:18.170
seven news cycle.
But yet they have these primate

335
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.360
<v 1>jeans,
artificial intelligence,
uh,
subjects about,</v>

336
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:26.361
which I know very little seems to me that it would on some level have to be

337
00:19:26.851 --> 00:19:31.620
derived from a particular aspect of human understanding of rationalism.

338
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:36.600
So we're represent in one aspect of our nature and prioritizing it.
Logic,

339
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.280
uh,
organization.

340
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.640
But what you refer to as sort of primitive and monkey ish for me envelops and

341
00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:49.560
involves the most beautiful aspects of our nature.

342
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.070
I'm a little romantic about human being still.

343
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.690
I still feel that.

344
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.280
I feel that one of the great problems we've had is that philosophically we have

345
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:04.020
overvalued materialism rationalism and like kind of knowing a little bit about

346
00:20:04.021 --> 00:20:08.190
philosophy primarily from that bloody podcast that you and I tagged a minute ago

347
00:20:08.191 --> 00:20:11.880
before we was recording.
Who's that going to last for as this?
So like what?

348
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.700
Why understand for that?
It's like Polish the enlightenment.

349
00:20:14.701 --> 00:20:16.860
We've started to prioritize rationalism.

350
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.170
So if you prioritize rationalism and organization,

351
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:20.490
which obviously has a lot to offer,

352
00:20:20.491 --> 00:20:24.030
the organization of resources is incredibly and hugely important.

353
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.230
You forget that a huge part of the human experience is nothing to do with that.

354
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.940
The other thing we were chatting about before we went live with DMT now know

355
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.740
artificial intelligence is going to understand that there is access to a realm

356
00:20:37.741 --> 00:20:42.741
of consciousness that continually exists that doesn't seem to be bound by

357
00:20:43.111 --> 00:20:45.000
physical laws as we understand them.

358
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:50.110
And if the physical laws that we abide our parochial and relevant only to this

359
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:51.310
level of existence,

360
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:56.610
why are we allowing ideas resourced from there to govern all of our systems.

361
00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.430
You know,
even listen to you talk about the empty and you now I encountered these

362
00:21:00.431 --> 00:21:00.941
gestures.

363
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:05.860
I the adjusters are went through this membrane into another realm and checking

364
00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:08.300
out Mike Tyson when he was on here.
[inaudible]

365
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:15.470
amazing.
Like,
uh,
like the clear like,
you know,

366
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.091
I only,

367
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:21.091
I took acid when I was a teenager and even in very unhealthy cannot.

368
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.910
I'm healthy but blight,
unbridled mad teenage boy conditions.
I,
you know,

369
00:21:24.911 --> 00:21:27.840
I want to be there with a guy in a lab coat with a pen going,
well Mr. Brown,

370
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:32.260
sit down and look at these Rorschach tests instead of which I mean new cross in

371
00:21:32.261 --> 00:21:36.700
a bedsit dropping acid and staring at my own hands.
And recognizing,
oh my God,

372
00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:39.790
I'm not me.
The very idea of me as a construct,

373
00:21:39.791 --> 00:21:44.680
I'm just tuned into a particular aspect.
I AI will build systems that are,

374
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:49.830
that are predicated on rationalism organization and I on on that basis,

375
00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:53.800
I can see why they would at some point,
yeah,
go all skynet and annihilate us.

376
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.210
But that is,

377
00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.430
I believe the problem with our society is that the materialistic aspect of our

378
00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:02.500
nature is not the priority.

379
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.810
It's just one thing we should be doing because we need good roads because many

380
00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.840
hospitals,
schools,
food,
et cetera.

381
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.450
But we need to find a way of honoring the sacred.

382
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:15.160
And I'm fascinated in the experiences you're having in these psychedelic

383
00:22:15.161 --> 00:22:18.820
explorations and how it's influencing the rest of your life.

384
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.580
Like how you're saying like how your,

385
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:24.220
how does it influence the rest of your decisions,
the way you see the world,

386
00:22:24.221 --> 00:22:25.210
the way you see relationships,

387
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:29.560
the way you see the vulnerable young man you were prior to building your own.

388
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.710
I say personal religion of Marcia Lars,

389
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.500
excellence in your chosen field of standup comedy.

390
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.770
How do you incorporate that vulnerable kid?

391
00:22:38.771 --> 00:22:41.890
Cause I'm still very aware of the vulnerable person.
I was like,

392
00:22:41.891 --> 00:22:42.730
I'm going on a rant man.

393
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.560
Like when Kevin Hart was on here who I think he's amazing and he was amazing on

394
00:22:47.561 --> 00:22:51.130
this.
I thought fucking hell.
Like what have I got to offer the world?

395
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.400
When Kevin Hart has got this kind of force,

396
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:58.570
you don't come in the bubble and not.
I was like,
my God,
this guy is so positive.

397
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:03.070
What a role model more he's got to offer and then I thought,
well,
like any of us,

398
00:23:03.071 --> 00:23:07.210
what I've got to offer is who I am,
just who I am and then vulnerable,

399
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:08.380
flawed human being.

400
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.590
There's still feels connected to the kid I was when I didn't feel good enough.

401
00:23:11.591 --> 00:23:14.470
I still feel that I can walk in a room and feel that.

402
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.910
I also know that that that's not real because I've had spiritual experiences,

403
00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:23.500
hallucinogenic experiences that make me feel that the relationships we should be

404
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:26.200
building have to honor that we are both,

405
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:29.650
we are vulnerable and flawed but also capable of greatness.

406
00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:30.910
There has to be room for all of this.

407
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.820
And I feel that part of what we're doing and part of why we're experiencing such

408
00:23:33.821 --> 00:23:38.020
superficial polarity in politics and culture is cause we're not acknowledging

409
00:23:38.021 --> 00:23:41.950
that underneath this surface activity of left,
right,
left,
right.
And you know,

410
00:23:41.951 --> 00:23:45.680
from Sam Harris,
them little experiments,
you stick garbage in front of a pest.

411
00:23:45.681 --> 00:23:48.440
I'm on their blade,
become Republican pretty quickly.
Or You,
you know,

412
00:23:48.441 --> 00:23:51.050
you scare people,
they become less democratic.
You know,

413
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.070
I think all that stuff is pretty superficial and at depth in that realm of the

414
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:57.800
gestures and the membrane of Psychedelia,

415
00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.490
we have access to oneness and that should be what's influencing the way we set

416
00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:03.350
up our tribes,
our systems and our relationship.

417
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.590
<v 2>Yeah.
I think when a guy like Kevin Hart shows you what a,</v>

418
00:24:07.591 --> 00:24:10.320
a positive and motivational,
uh,

419
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:15.850
impact one person can have just with his words and his deeds and the way he

420
00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:20.510
lives his life,
he's so inspirational that you realize,

421
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.670
uh,
that,
that that is possible.

422
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:27.671
That you can share that energy and that you can have these experiences with

423
00:24:28.101 --> 00:24:31.760
people where they literally do actually they actually uplift you.

424
00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:36.740
Like I was uplifted by his conversation.
I felt like,
wow,
that guy is so positive.

425
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.890
What a great way to look at the life that we're living.

426
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.410
And the more people do that,
the better.

427
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:47.060
And when someone like that does spread a positive message,
you know,

428
00:24:47.061 --> 00:24:50.360
and obviously he's got,
he's materialistic as well.

429
00:24:50.361 --> 00:24:53.540
He's got a bunch of cars in a big house and he makes a lot of money and he does

430
00:24:53.541 --> 00:24:54.260
a lot of movies.

431
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:59.260
But what he's spreading is this very motivational,

432
00:24:59.361 --> 00:25:04.361
very positive message and that affects people in a very positive way to and all

433
00:25:04.641 --> 00:25:07.160
that left right shit and all this,
uh,
the,
the,

434
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:11.870
all the battles that we have politically and ideologically back and forth and

435
00:25:11.871 --> 00:25:16.040
all the negative venom that people spray at each other at the end of the day,

436
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.880
that this is not benefiting anyone unless you're fighting some,
uh,

437
00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:24.830
major and that the world needs to conquer in most of that.
Most of it's not that.

438
00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:29.120
Most of it is like finding demons out of innocuous things.
You know?

439
00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:33.590
And I think when you talk about what,
what you have to offer,

440
00:25:33.591 --> 00:25:36.710
well you have to offer is that you are you,

441
00:25:36.711 --> 00:25:38.540
that you have this unique perspective,
you,

442
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:43.870
you can affect the way people view their own journey in life because you've been

443
00:25:43.911 --> 00:25:48.911
so introspective and so aware of your own pros and cons in terms of your past

444
00:25:51.441 --> 00:25:55.640
behavior,
your current behavior and who you are now and who you used to be.

445
00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.150
All that stuff is fuel for people because they can relate.
They hear it.

446
00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:02.660
I mean maybe they not relate it to being a movie star and being this famous guy

447
00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:05.870
and the strip,
but they can relate to the humanity of your struggle.

448
00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.320
They put themselves in your position like what must that have been like?

449
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.800
And look at this guy who has made these conscious decisions to not be like that

450
00:26:12.801 --> 00:26:15.770
anymore.
And He dresses like a homeless person with a crazy beard.

451
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:21.230
<v 1>That's the real take home information.
Dress like you live out of doors.</v>

452
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.320
Yeah.
Just like you're a homeless guy in Oregon

453
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.810
specifically there people will respect that.
Yeah,
it's like a dark colors,

454
00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:31.850
you know,
it rains a lot and I get it.

455
00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:36.480
I get the reference and I understand American culture.
Joe Rogan.
Yeah.
So um,

456
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.060
hey can I do some Como like tell me what it's called.
What is it?

457
00:26:41.061 --> 00:26:42.970
This book is called mentors and I,

458
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.220
I read like I read bits of it again cause I knew I was coming here and I think

459
00:26:47.221 --> 00:26:48.210
he's actually pretty good.

460
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:53.490
Like I wrote quite a lot about Brazilian Jujitsu.
Really Love It,

461
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:55.890
Huh?
Yeah I do.
My writing is not from a,

462
00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.530
you'll understand not from a technical perspective.

463
00:26:58.531 --> 00:27:03.150
I'm not saying this is what I've got to say on open guard to transition.

464
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:08.300
I'm talking about how the psychological impact that it's had on me and also in

465
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:12.300
there about like the protocols of going to a group which as a beginner are very

466
00:27:12.301 --> 00:27:15.150
relevant.
Like you touched on how ritualized it is.

467
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:20.480
I got a hunch that the more we emulate and connect to original ways of human

468
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:21.151
behavior,

469
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:26.151
whether that's diet tree or hierarchies or organization of groups,

470
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.510
I feel that we will feel a sense of greater connection.

471
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.960
Now the thing I got from Gannon Bjj classes,
genesis,

472
00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:38.670
where I'll go back in England is like that all the white belts get changed at

473
00:27:38.671 --> 00:27:39.660
one end of the room,

474
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.750
the purple belts and above get changed at the upper end of the room,

475
00:27:42.751 --> 00:27:46.560
which coincidentally or not is where the control for the timer is and the

476
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:49.290
control for the music is and where the kit is.

477
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.950
That's all up that room to enter the room.
So all the control is that end,

478
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.090
but it begins with sort of dancing around in a circle,

479
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.800
doing all of those various exercises.
Now lift your knees,

480
00:27:58.801 --> 00:28:02.550
now do the shrimp in and that kind of stuff.
It's the lower belt.

481
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:07.320
Shouldn't invite a higher belt to spa or role,
you know,

482
00:28:07.321 --> 00:28:10.470
it's that and like the,
as you say,
the amount of respect,
the bowing,

483
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.860
the handshaking at the end of it,
it's so soft.

484
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:18.950
It provides such a safe environment in which to deal with the primal.

485
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.680
I can see why it's valuable and it's the like,
you know,

486
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.840
I should been taught that shit when I was 1413 like Amanda terribly so that I

487
00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:29.430
didn't come across it.
Like,
you know,

488
00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.960
you're not going to be setting fire to feel Jen allotments and put in frogs on

489
00:28:33.961 --> 00:28:38.640
fireworks if you've got a way of dealing with that primal energy when,

490
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.300
when it's coming.
So I don't understand that.

491
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:42.840
Think that you should suppress it somehow.

492
00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:44.850
We should just ignore it or suppress it.

493
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:48.390
They don't understand that when men it really ever a biological male,

494
00:28:48.391 --> 00:28:51.220
it really needs to be tackled head on.
I mean,
you really,

495
00:28:51.221 --> 00:28:56.221
you really need to embrace what it is to be a physical mail and it frees you in

496
00:28:57.121 --> 00:28:57.571
a lot of ways.

497
00:28:57.571 --> 00:29:01.260
Do you think this might be a comparable moment too in the 1960s when there was a

498
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:05.190
sort of a sense of sexual repression versus sexual free love?
You know,

499
00:29:05.191 --> 00:29:08.550
the images of Woodstock and flowers in their hair and smoking joints and having

500
00:29:08.551 --> 00:29:12.520
sort of sex outdoors in mud or possibly wheat that,
that,

501
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:18.070
that this time of like a kind of an anger about maleness and maleness may not,

502
00:29:19.081 --> 00:29:23.160
as you said,
it may be a biological male bay,
it could be the energy of,

503
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.740
I don't know,
assertion or wherever these like,
you know,

504
00:29:25.741 --> 00:29:30.450
as in grammar in male and female relate to certain words as in French grammar

505
00:29:30.451 --> 00:29:33.510
where,
I don't know,
Kat is female and doggies mount,
I don't know the system,

506
00:29:33.511 --> 00:29:35.550
I don't speak French,
but I'm saying that these,

507
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.230
we have labeled these entities and it does seem that a,

508
00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.480
that there is a particular,
and what I want to say,

509
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.590
condemnation of male energy.
Do you think you can,
I'm from a misunderstanding.

510
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:48.370
Yeah.
And also

511
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:52.090
<v 3>I think it comes from a big generalization to yeah,
it's easy to do,
right?
And,</v>

512
00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:54.670
and if you're a woman has had negative experiences with men,

513
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:58.900
maybe you've dated men that had been physically abusive or maybe known men that

514
00:29:58.901 --> 00:30:03.520
had been physically abusive and you,
you were around that and you just,
uh,
it's,

515
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:07.780
it's very convenient and very easy to just generalize and decided that all men

516
00:30:07.781 --> 00:30:12.430
are negative.
Masculine energy is negative and especially white males.

517
00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.720
And if you say that you'll get props online,
people go,
yes,
girl,
yes,
clap,
clap,

518
00:30:16.721 --> 00:30:20.050
clap.
People get excited.
But those are also people that are short sided.

519
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.540
Like you want to make as many people,
your allies.
You can,

520
00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:24.460
you want to make as many people,
your friend as you can.

521
00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.190
And you have to understand that there's some people that are just wired

522
00:30:27.191 --> 00:30:28.240
different than you.
There's some,

523
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:32.260
there's some girly girls and there's some really feminine men.

524
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.420
And then there's a masculine man and then,

525
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:39.160
but everybody is okay as long as they respect you and they're kind to each
other.

526
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.930
But the problem is we associate certain behaviors and characteristics with

527
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:48.931
either negativity or hedonism or a toxic masculinity or someone being a bitch as

528
00:30:51.761 --> 00:30:53.980
a man.
And that's,

529
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:59.050
these generalizations are often way more harmful and just it's just too

530
00:30:59.051 --> 00:31:01.120
convenient and easy and lazy.

531
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.630
<v 1>Yeah,
there is no simple way.</v>

532
00:31:02.631 --> 00:31:05.300
And when I think about my own attitudes in this area,

533
00:31:05.301 --> 00:31:07.970
there is a degree of complexity because I've got young daughters,

534
00:31:07.971 --> 00:31:11.090
I've got a two year old and a one year old.
Right.

535
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.600
And there you know daughters so like,
but when they have a day,

536
00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.080
cause I'm staying in Los Angeles,
Gabby,
she's Mexican.
She used to,

537
00:31:18.081 --> 00:31:21.350
but when I first moved out here and lived my entourage lifestyle,

538
00:31:21.351 --> 00:31:25.100
she used to look after the house and she used to think like,
oh my baby,
my baby,

539
00:31:25.101 --> 00:31:26.120
she loved me so night.

540
00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.940
Like I'll take a matriarchal figure wherever I can find one.

541
00:31:28.941 --> 00:31:30.920
And Gabby used to look after me.
She adored me and stuff.

542
00:31:30.921 --> 00:31:35.240
I stayed friends with her yesterday.
She come around,
she bought like a,
like what?

543
00:31:35.241 --> 00:31:38.920
I can only describe as a bikini for like my baby daughter like that.

544
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:43.260
What a two year old that doesn't need like a,
like a bikini like top,

545
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.460
excuse me,
burping on the mic.
I like it.
For me,

546
00:31:46.461 --> 00:31:48.740
I felt like I don't want to put my daughter in that.

547
00:31:48.741 --> 00:31:53.741
That's sort of in a way actualizing the like that child and like covering so and

548
00:31:54.621 --> 00:31:58.190
also a lot of the time like with my daughter,
I don't live with my wife,

549
00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.280
particularly if our first child I'm like don't dress her up in little dresses

550
00:32:01.281 --> 00:32:04.400
and stuff because she won't be out to run around.
And I thought my God,
I'm not,

551
00:32:04.401 --> 00:32:08.000
that's not that different from like the cliche of a male parent.

552
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:11.650
That one it at sun and I didn't want to sign or Beano in particular.

553
00:32:11.651 --> 00:32:14.270
I love this kid,
I love this kid regarding,
you know,

554
00:32:14.271 --> 00:32:16.500
it doesn't mean I love having the door,
the door her,

555
00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:21.820
but like I am aware that these things of like dress child this way,

556
00:32:22.341 --> 00:32:23.300
dress a girl this way.

557
00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:26.630
Our constructs fervor to what we were talking about again before by Michelle

558
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.170
Fuko.
We've got a lot done before we went live man.
But when we have to Graham,

559
00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:33.890
Michel Foucault,
what he exposes a lot is that there and a delusion Jill,

560
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:38.060
Gilda lose is that a lot of things that we take for granted is be normal or

561
00:32:38.061 --> 00:32:41.600
actually constructs.
When I say a child's bikini of it,

562
00:32:41.601 --> 00:32:45.830
there's no reason for any child of any sex or gender to be wearing a bloody

563
00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:46.664
bikini.

564
00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:51.500
So a child with tits is a terrifying idea for for all,

565
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:54.500
but a very small and terrifying percentage of the population.

566
00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:59.630
So like that is an example of the external feminization of a child.

567
00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:02.610
Like say when there's an argument of feminist argument of,
you know,

568
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.330
gender is a construct.
I can see,
oh yeah,

569
00:33:05.331 --> 00:33:08.990
it's what point is there is there are constructs.
You cannot be like,

570
00:33:08.991 --> 00:33:11.060
my opinion is you can't argue with biology.

571
00:33:11.061 --> 00:33:15.230
Chromosomes are doing what they're doing in the physical realm.
But like a I,

572
00:33:15.231 --> 00:33:15.531
you know,

573
00:33:15.531 --> 00:33:20.531
like being a father to a daughter has made me feel like I don't obviously,

574
00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:25.110
and I know you have daughters or at least they thought three,
$3.
Like I like,

575
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.080
I'm certainly very aware of,

576
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:30.710
I don't want to push them down some culturally prescribed avenue,

577
00:33:30.711 --> 00:33:34.010
whether it's about their dress,
their sexuality or anything.
So I've got,
you know,

578
00:33:34.011 --> 00:33:36.140
where do I,
where am I on that dial?
You know?

579
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:37.011
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

580
00:33:37.011 --> 00:33:42.011
You've got to just not put any pressure on them and let them enjoy their life

581
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:45.770
and let them find their path.
That's what it's weird.
It's weird,
right?

582
00:33:45.771 --> 00:33:49.640
It's like I see people,
they're,
you know,
they're getting their,

583
00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.410
their daughters to dress very,

584
00:33:51.411 --> 00:33:55.490
very feminine with a little mini skirts and stuff when they're five years old

585
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:58.400
and high heel shoes.
I've seen little kids with high heel shoes.

586
00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.980
It seems very strange to me.
I don't like it.

587
00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.280
<v 1>Yeah.
What,
so,
you know,
but for me,</v>

588
00:34:03.281 --> 00:34:06.840
that is being sourced from like co we can extrapolate that to,

589
00:34:06.841 --> 00:34:10.120
well then why should a 20 year old woman wear high heels?
I mean,

590
00:34:10.121 --> 00:34:13.050
I've read cultural analysis.
I'm sure you have have labile.

591
00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:18.060
The lipstick is to emphasize the lips because it's redolent of the vagina.

592
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.510
The high heels is to make a woman seemed more vulnerable and to accentuate

593
00:34:22.511 --> 00:34:24.790
aspects of body shape.
And then these can be,
you know,

594
00:34:24.791 --> 00:34:27.680
seen as evidence of the influence of Patriarchy there.

595
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.110
That there's loads of areas where I feel like,

596
00:34:29.410 --> 00:34:32.410
why are we looking for shit to argue about in this area?
We're just human beings.

597
00:34:32.411 --> 00:34:36.100
Most of us,
the most important people in our life up of the earth,

598
00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.590
the diff or a different gender or sex to us.
You know,

599
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.810
why are we live for arguments?
But I can,

600
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:45.460
you can see the influence of cultural forces that are,

601
00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:48.370
<v 3>you know,
not neutral.
Yeah,
you certainly can,</v>

602
00:34:48.371 --> 00:34:51.820
but I think it should be up to the choice of the person once they're an adult.

603
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.510
The real problem is putting pressure on them to dress one way or another and not

604
00:34:55.511 --> 00:34:58.630
letting them find their place.
But if a woman becomes,
you know,

605
00:34:58.631 --> 00:35:02.380
whatever age you decide and she wants to wear high heels and a skirt because she

606
00:35:02.381 --> 00:35:04.660
likes the way it looks like there's nothing wrong with that either.

607
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:09.850
Are are the demonization of sexuality is also a problem.

608
00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.013
You know the,
yes.

609
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:16.430
It is almost as much of a problem as people who will pray upon vulnerable

610
00:35:17.891 --> 00:35:19.630
people.
The the peep people,

611
00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:23.500
people that think there's something wrong with being sexually attractive or

612
00:35:23.501 --> 00:35:26.740
something wrong with being desirable or wanting to be desirable.

613
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:29.440
There's nothing wrong with that either and that kind of suppression to

614
00:35:29.441 --> 00:35:33.310
suppression of these feelings that you have and this desire that you have,

615
00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.390
it's very unhealthy as well.
It's a normal thing to want to be sexual.

616
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.770
It's a normal thing to want to look good.
If a girl looks good in a skirt,

617
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.440
a skirt and high heels and she likes to dress like that,

618
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.590
who the fuck is anyone to saying there's anything wrong with that?

619
00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:50.250
There's nothing wrong with it.
It's if that's what she likes,
that's fun.

620
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.400
Which is what's interesting to me is particularly in really progressive

621
00:35:56.041 --> 00:35:56.940
ideology.

622
00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:02.450
They look down upon women who wear short skirts and high heels and a lot of

623
00:36:04.561 --> 00:36:08.190
makeup and you know open tops that show their boobs.

624
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:12.070
I guess they think that it's,
they're playing into the patriarchy or the,

625
00:36:12.071 --> 00:36:15.960
there's somehow or another falling into these gender traps,

626
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:21.270
but yet they celebrate that in transgender people they celebrate that and Trans

627
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:25.500
men that transitioned to women and then they,
they they really doll it up.

628
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:26.880
Then they'll like you go girl.

629
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.420
Then they're celebrating the fact that this person is embracing these

630
00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:34.470
traditional aspects of womanhood.
Like you see that a lot with you know,

631
00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:39.420
people that are celebrating Trans Women.
So I find it very fascinating.

632
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.340
<v 1>The aesthetics of a,</v>

633
00:36:41.341 --> 00:36:45.540
that sort of what would be perhaps could be referred to you with sexualized

634
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.990
dress or like a,

635
00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:52.620
I suppose in males expression expressive or garish clove in jewelry,

636
00:36:52.621 --> 00:36:57.450
tattoos and I understand in British culture that these are often indicators of

637
00:36:57.451 --> 00:37:02.451
class that like that it's typically the lower down the Clo class structure you

638
00:37:03.631 --> 00:37:03.871
are,

639
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:08.490
the more likely you are to dress in a way that is exhibit if or like you know

640
00:37:08.491 --> 00:37:12.960
women from a blue collar background dress in ways that are exposing,

641
00:37:12.961 --> 00:37:16.980
revealing men have Larry cars and lots of tattoos and jewelry,

642
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:20.700
expressive ways of demonstrating wealth.
The higher you go up the class,

643
00:37:20.701 --> 00:37:24.340
the more subtle and more dressed down,
you know,
labels or that sort of stuff.

644
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.840
You know.

645
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.680
So in British culture there's a different system of like a different system for

646
00:37:28.681 --> 00:37:29.341
referencing it.

647
00:37:29.341 --> 00:37:33.510
I wonder how that works in American culture with its sort of like it's evident

648
00:37:33.511 --> 00:37:37.140
and match,
discuss racial divisions like certain things.

649
00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:42.210
It seems like a subtle subtle way of condemning particular types of womanhood

650
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:46.710
that may not just be sourced from dress this way for the male gaze.

651
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:50.220
It can also be a way of saying dressing that way as an indication of a lower

652
00:37:50.221 --> 00:37:53.520
class background or of a particular type of ethnicity.

653
00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.670
But there's also the

654
00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:00.780
<v 3>reality of males and females is there's a lot of fucking jealous people and</v>

655
00:38:00.781 --> 00:38:05.340
there's a lot of women that just don't have the type of physical body that looks

656
00:38:05.341 --> 00:38:09.240
good in a short skirt with high heels and you know,

657
00:38:09.241 --> 00:38:13.980
a low cut shirt and they don't like when they see it in other women because they

658
00:38:13.981 --> 00:38:14.280
don't,

659
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.010
they're not comfortable with their own bodies there that there's a reality of

660
00:38:17.011 --> 00:38:20.970
that.
I mean,
women get as much or more hate from women as they ever do for men.

661
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:26.270
And it particularly if women find you to be too overtly sexual with the way you

662
00:38:27.781 --> 00:38:32.010
dress or behave,
that you're,
you're,
you know,
you're damaging male,

663
00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:36.160
female relationships,
you're damaging the dynamic particular office dynamics.

664
00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:39.490
<v 0>If there's one girl in the office that likes to tramp it up,
you know,</v>

665
00:38:39.491 --> 00:38:42.520
and she's a,
and all the guys are paying attention to her,

666
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:43.480
women will get mad at her.

667
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:48.310
I am did a interview a while go where I sort of talked about like pet parent in

668
00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.090
our kids,
me and my wife,
how we parent our kids and I said like,
uh,
you know,

669
00:38:52.091 --> 00:38:52.411
it goes well,

670
00:38:52.411 --> 00:38:56.170
I'll have to be on a smart boy if he's much the more dominant parent.

671
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:58.570
She's much more practical than I am.
Right.

672
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:02.440
And like stuff that got that got like really negatively written about people

673
00:39:02.441 --> 00:39:05.680
centered black.
I go,
she changes more diapers the night and stuff.
Right.

674
00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.760
And then I said,
look,
I don't change diapers or whatever.
It's just my wife,

675
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:10.361
you know,

676
00:39:10.361 --> 00:39:15.280
regardless of our respective sexes is the more efficient dominant parents.

677
00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:19.360
She's much more likely with light with me.
If my dog goes,
I want that chocolate.

678
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.990
The answer to for me is okay,
all right.
You know,
like,
like I can't bear it.

679
00:39:22.991 --> 00:39:27.580
I see the,
the resistance,
the emotional explosion.
I concede much too early.

680
00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:30.670
I tap out very quickly with my two year old.

681
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:33.970
My wife is much more now that it's played a long game that's bring up a child.

682
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:37.440
It's not governed by impulse is like you and I spoke in fact to that gap or

683
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:40.660
motto that expert on addiction and he's amazing and he says,

684
00:39:40.661 --> 00:39:44.290
because of your own anxiety and pain from your own childhood with no disrespect

685
00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:46.090
to my magnificent parents,
uh,

686
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:50.920
like you can't andall seeing your kid suffer so you'd like straight away you

687
00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:53.610
bail and do what she wants and stuff.
Now they have like,

688
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:58.620
so there's so much complexity in the reality of our personal little domestic

689
00:39:59.021 --> 00:40:02.320
relationship and I'm certainly will not saying and everyone else should run

690
00:40:02.321 --> 00:40:05.110
their household in that manner as well.
So help me God,

691
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:09.010
any man that changes it or you know,
but the way it's reported is like,

692
00:40:09.011 --> 00:40:12.520
that's what happens.
I think in modern media.
It's like change what you say,

693
00:40:12.521 --> 00:40:16.270
then you have to defend what they said.
You sit on that and what I meant,

694
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.150
I'd like,
you know,
I'm not saying that because my wife is a woman,

695
00:40:19.151 --> 00:40:20.580
she should take more domestic duties.

696
00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.440
I'm just saying that in our household she seems to have a set of attributes and

697
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:27.790
characteristics that make her take control of that aspect of parenting.

698
00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.250
And it's like the,
the desire to judge,

699
00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:34.750
condemn an object is the priority as opponents to,
you know,

700
00:40:34.751 --> 00:40:38.140
no one's looking to go on.
It's new cares or what you know,
well,

701
00:40:38.141 --> 00:40:41.410
it's also that they're doing it publicly,
so they're doing it most,
I mean,

702
00:40:41.411 --> 00:40:44.920
if you're either reading comments or you're reading articles and if you're

703
00:40:44.921 --> 00:40:45.701
reading articles,

704
00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:48.160
they're just looking for something to be upset about their watch you,

705
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.890
and they'll say,
okay,
this is this a viable target?
Yes,

706
00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.520
we got confirmation what he said about changing diapers or his wife being a

707
00:40:54.521 --> 00:40:57.640
better parent is a viable target.
Let's go after him.

708
00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.290
And then they just formulate some bullshit argument about who you really are

709
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:06.160
based on what might have been a throw away or a concession to your wife or even

710
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:09.810
just a compliment to your wives will come to the self deprecating to yourselves.

711
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:13.030
Yeah.
But it doesn't,
people don't,
they're not looking at things rationally.

712
00:41:13.031 --> 00:41:16.570
They're just looking at targets.
It's P,
particularly people that write articles,

713
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.420
you know,
what's the best article?
It's gotta to be negative.

714
00:41:19.421 --> 00:41:24.070
Like one of the things that came out of all this a Facebook algorithm stuff is

715
00:41:24.071 --> 00:41:29.071
you find out that Facebook realize somewhere early on that the way to encourage

716
00:41:29.981 --> 00:41:33.980
engagement is to get people upset.
They get way more

717
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.980
<v 2>engaged and they go back and forth and an inner interact with these posts way</v>

718
00:41:39.111 --> 00:41:43.220
more.
If they're upset,
then they do.
If they agree with it,
if they agree with it,

719
00:41:43.221 --> 00:41:45.980
they might give it a like or a thumbs up and say,
hey,
that's great and that's it.

720
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:49.340
That's where it ends.
But if you know someone's talking about,
you know,

721
00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:51.380
we shouldn't build the wall,
we should let everyone in.

722
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:55.400
And you put that on some fucking Trump guys page and they ah,
it's crazy.

723
00:41:55.401 --> 00:41:58.880
I mean you will get thousands and thousands and thousands of interactions.

724
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:03.260
And so Facebook realized that the way to keep people,
and you know,

725
00:42:03.261 --> 00:42:03.951
they could claim that,

726
00:42:03.951 --> 00:42:07.610
that it's an algorithm and the algorithm just supports whatever the people were

727
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:10.820
really interested in.
But what they're interested in is conflict.

728
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:14.510
<v 1>That demonstrates my earlier point,
which I made up on the spot.
Yeah.</v>

729
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.970
Ai is not a neutral thing.

730
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:21.250
It is resourced from human perspectives and cause that is a type of AI and that

731
00:42:21.251 --> 00:42:23.780
was not as complex as right now what we're going to experience,

732
00:42:23.781 --> 00:42:27.720
and I can't even imagine,
but what I'm saying is,
is it still die a one,

733
00:42:27.721 --> 00:42:31.790
I want to say resourced from a human,
from a human perspective.
And yes,

734
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:36.791
of course we are evolved to respond more strongly to negativity than positivity

735
00:42:37.461 --> 00:42:38.091
for loads of reasons.

736
00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:42.170
And I think that's where we can stitch back to what we were saying about taking

737
00:42:42.171 --> 00:42:45.260
personal responsibility for who you are.
Like that.

738
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.480
None of us after sit on Social Media Guy,
I'm fuck you.
Fuck you.
I,
you know,

739
00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:52.010
none of us have to do that.
We can try and resolve though.

740
00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:54.530
I respect that some people don't have any other outlets.

741
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:57.170
They don't have the privileges I have of being out go,
uh,

742
00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.510
support groups where people openly talk about it.

743
00:42:59.511 --> 00:43:01.460
This is the ways that I felt inferior today.

744
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.190
This is the ways that I'm trying to become a better man.

745
00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:06.620
And a better father and a backhoe worker,
you know,

746
00:43:06.621 --> 00:43:09.350
like a lot of people aren't afforded those environments and probably the best

747
00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:12.710
shot they got is having a go is that with someone online and those people,

748
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.810
you know in a way deserve love and sympathy.

749
00:43:14.811 --> 00:43:19.811
But until we on some level recognize that we can all are our own behaviors,

750
00:43:20.751 --> 00:43:23.320
we can all are our own consciousness.
All right.

751
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.220
I don't see how there's going to be,

752
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:29.470
well at least then we can create a terrain upon which a better,

753
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:33.530
better systems can start to flourish.
Do you read comments?
No.

754
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:37.190
I actually like,
ah,
I'm too sensitive.

755
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:41.300
I can just about manage to listen to people's replies to my conversation.
Like,

756
00:43:41.301 --> 00:43:45.140
you know,
like,
so like,
yeah,
I don't go on to like,
I have a,

757
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:48.630
like I work with someone who does my social media and like she,

758
00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.260
she gives me stuff like,
hey,
respond to these things.

759
00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:55.220
Put some output on that because I don't,
uh,
I don't want to engage with that.

760
00:43:55.221 --> 00:43:58.340
I don't want to like walk up and down any street and knocking on the dog.

761
00:43:58.341 --> 00:44:01.040
And do you like me?
Do you like me to you like me?
I don't.

762
00:44:01.041 --> 00:44:03.650
I don't want to deal with people's responses in various conditions.

763
00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:05.670
<v 2>Well,
it's also much like the articles,</v>

764
00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.850
the way people get a response out of you or the way to people to get your

765
00:44:08.851 --> 00:44:12.930
reaction is to say something really negative.
You look at some,

766
00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.680
sometimes when people are not that savvy when it comes to social media,

767
00:44:16.681 --> 00:44:19.650
one thing is that one of the things that you'll notice is they'll interact,

768
00:44:19.651 --> 00:44:22.740
and I've been guilty of this in the past before I sort of realized what I was

769
00:44:22.741 --> 00:44:25.860
doing.
You would only respond to negative things.

770
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.810
I think people were arguing with people.
Meanwhile,

771
00:44:27.811 --> 00:44:30.300
people are saying nice things to you and you ignore them.
Yeah.

772
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.180
It's cause you don't,
don't you add a certain level,

773
00:44:33.181 --> 00:44:37.020
you don't have the physical time.
It doesn't exist to respond to everyone.

774
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.130
It's not possible.

775
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:43.200
If you get 13,000 comments on one of your posts,

776
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:47.970
how the fuck does anyone have time to respond to 13,000 people?

777
00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:48.803
You can't.

778
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:52.550
And then you have email and you have Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and it's

779
00:44:52.551 --> 00:44:55.410
just,
there's no way it's,
there's not enough time in this world.

780
00:44:55.710 --> 00:45:00.100
So you would pass me would've responded to things that cause the more visceral,

781
00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.880
I saw someone saying something that was untrue but like fuck you this on true.

782
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:05.730
But then I realize like what do you,
why are you doing?

783
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.370
Like this is a new thing for people.

784
00:45:08.371 --> 00:45:12.600
There's never been a time where people have had this instantaneous interaction

785
00:45:12.601 --> 00:45:17.550
with people unfiltered on moderated globally.

786
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:19.630
Yeah.
It's very strange to,

787
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.920
to be able to do that and to be able to go back and forth and just,
Eh,

788
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:25.680
just to be able to give your comments on things,

789
00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:28.890
to be able to talk about things and it's very addictive to people.
Yeah,

790
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:31.650
that's right.
And that's why I'm very cautious with it.

791
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:36.510
I have to sort of sell my life out.
Like I'm essentially a monk in a marriage.

792
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:41.570
That's basically where I live.
Get up,
meditate,
do yoga,
do

793
00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.700
<v 1>exercises,
do things that are positive for you.</v>

794
00:45:43.701 --> 00:45:47.390
Watch the way that you're thinking.
I'm interested in where again,

795
00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:52.310
in with your own,
do you feel uh,

796
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:55.670
connected to the person you were as an adolescent?

797
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:58.220
Did you notice it in your own parent in,
do you know,

798
00:45:58.221 --> 00:46:00.410
is it in the type of choices you make because their image,

799
00:46:00.411 --> 00:46:03.260
I have a view from the outside is like that you have literally built something

800
00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:03.741
for yourself.

801
00:46:03.741 --> 00:46:08.720
You operate within it and you are quite protected and you are independent and

802
00:46:08.721 --> 00:46:12.800
not forced to deal with too many negative outside influences by an unavoidable

803
00:46:12.801 --> 00:46:15.800
dynamics that unnecessary dynamics like uh,
you know,

804
00:46:15.801 --> 00:46:18.560
as a father and dealing with colleagues and stuff like that.

805
00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.120
Do you experience a lot of tension,
anxiety?
What,
what,

806
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:26.390
what has happened to that guy?
Do you feel that you have transcended that?

807
00:46:26.391 --> 00:46:29.510
Cause I do in my own life feel like,
yeah.
After I'm not the adolescent boy was.

808
00:46:29.511 --> 00:46:30.201
I've like,
you know,

809
00:46:30.201 --> 00:46:34.130
I've learned from that and I still in a very sort of cold psychological way.

810
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:38.300
Yeah.
When I'm doing a Hubiera,
that's their g Bjj classes I'm doing over here.

811
00:46:38.301 --> 00:46:42.380
We have professor Ricardo Wilkies,
amazing guy.
Like when I'm,

812
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:43.610
when I'm doing those classes,

813
00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:48.480
I have caught a sense of fathering my child self of like,
you know,

814
00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.760
cause I weren't doing those kinds of things when I was a kid.
I'm like,

815
00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:51.500
so all right Russell,

816
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:56.500
we're just in a Bjj class and it's a panic there to impress anybody,

817
00:46:56.541 --> 00:46:58.670
right.
Just do.
If you don't know,
just ask.

818
00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.970
I've got a voice in myself because I chat to Tony Robbins,
you know,

819
00:47:01.971 --> 00:47:05.840
he's like a number obviously high achieving guy who I admire and respect a great

820
00:47:05.841 --> 00:47:07.010
deal and like,

821
00:47:07.011 --> 00:47:09.650
you know when he talks he does like these cold plunges and he says before I get

822
00:47:09.651 --> 00:47:12.710
in that project that you're getting in that fucking punch and I keep telling us,

823
00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:15.080
my God,
I don't talk to myself.
I was like,
Ryan Russell,

824
00:47:15.081 --> 00:47:17.370
we're going to get in the cold plan.
Should we going to let you know by,

825
00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:21.350
I have to talk to myself.
Jenny,
what are you doing with that aspect of yourself?

826
00:47:21.351 --> 00:47:22.610
Do you still have a relationship with it?

827
00:47:22.611 --> 00:47:25.490
How was it like when you're doing all these psychedelic cosmic Nordic

828
00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.200
explorations of the psyche,

829
00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:32.260
are you not encountering aspects of to on if undeveloped and addressed?

830
00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:35.740
<v 2>There's always going to be unaddressed and undeveloped aspects of yourself.</v>

831
00:47:35.741 --> 00:47:40.470
But I'm very,
very,
very different to who I was when I was a young boy.
I mean,
um,

832
00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:45.310
um,
I'm not 100% self actualized.
I don't think anybody is,

833
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.880
but I'm just a totally different human being.
I remember it,

834
00:47:48.881 --> 00:47:53.170
but I remember it with humor.
Like I remember a laugh.
I'm like,
wow,
so silly.

835
00:47:53.171 --> 00:47:56.530
I was so weird back then.
And uh,
you know,

836
00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:01.560
with life experience and developing confidence and understanding of who you are

837
00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:06.430
and why you have those feelings and why you were insecure and why he had so much

838
00:48:06.431 --> 00:48:09.300
self doubt,
martial arts helped me with that,

839
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.160
with that tremendously because it was the first thing that I ever did where I

840
00:48:12.161 --> 00:48:13.330
didn't feel like a loser.

841
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:17.200
So the first thing that I ever did where people like respected me and they liked

842
00:48:17.201 --> 00:48:19.600
me for it,
you know,
I'm like,
wow,
this is like,

843
00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:24.640
there was a feeling that I was completely unused to in the 14 previous years of

844
00:48:24.641 --> 00:48:26.860
my life.
All of a sudden there was this,

845
00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:32.100
this feeling that I was unusual.
I was unique,
I was special.
Wow.
Yeah.

846
00:48:32.101 --> 00:48:34.810
It was appreciated.
A good,
a quick,
yeah,
I was,

847
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:39.220
I had a natural inclination towards it and then I was obsessed with it,

848
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:43.270
so I was obsessed with this.
I was training every day,
all day long,

849
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.180
and then my instructor recognized it really early on,

850
00:48:46.181 --> 00:48:50.980
so he allowed me to train there for free and just I would teach classes and

851
00:48:50.981 --> 00:48:53.830
teaching classes helped me a lot as well because when you're teaching,

852
00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:57.340
you're breaking down techniques and you're you,
you,

853
00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:59.170
when you're showing someone how to do it,

854
00:48:59.171 --> 00:49:02.620
you really cementing those pathways in your own mind.

855
00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:06.920
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah,
that's right.
That must be an important step on the road to mastery.</v>

856
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:11.780
I see that clip where Eddie Bravo gave you your black belt and he were very

857
00:49:11.781 --> 00:49:15.170
moved by that.
Like,
so for me that like moments like that,

858
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:18.490
it must connect you to the beginning of the journey.

859
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:21.910
<v 2>Yeah,
that does.
Yeah,
for sure.
And it would still,
you know,
the,</v>

860
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:26.150
the journey of Jujitsu is a fascinating one because unless your,
someone who's,

861
00:49:26.151 --> 00:49:26.451
you know,

862
00:49:26.451 --> 00:49:30.620
a Salahi Barrow or John Jacques Machado or it's just a true master who's

863
00:49:30.621 --> 00:49:35.120
dedicated their entire life to it,
the journey is so long,
it's so long.

864
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:37.700
It's like if you're a guy who runs you like to run,

865
00:49:37.701 --> 00:49:41.030
I like to run a mile three or four days a week,
no big deal.
But then,
you know,

866
00:49:41.031 --> 00:49:44.840
your next door neighbor is an ultra marathon runners preparing for them the Moab

867
00:49:44.841 --> 00:49:48.470
to 40 where he's going to run 240 miles.
Yeah.
You're just,

868
00:49:48.471 --> 00:49:51.470
you're never going to catch up the same amount of times and you should always

869
00:49:51.471 --> 00:49:53.780
defer to that person when you have questions about running.

870
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.620
And that's how it is with Jujitsu.
Like is,
you know,
yeah,
I'm a black belt,

871
00:49:57.621 --> 00:50:00.830
but I'm not a black belt.
Like John Jacques Machado is a black belt is a,

872
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.570
there's levels to even to that.

873
00:50:02.571 --> 00:50:06.050
So I always have questions so the journey's never over.
It's always long.

874
00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:10.760
There's always a better way to get out of an arm bar or a better way to set up a

875
00:50:10.761 --> 00:50:12.920
triangle or whatever it is.
There's the,

876
00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:16.220
one of the beautiful things about Jujitsu is that it's so complex.

877
00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:18.260
There's so many variables,

878
00:50:18.261 --> 00:50:22.520
there's so many situations and interactions and exchanges and entries and

879
00:50:22.521 --> 00:50:26.030
defenses and and and way to chain moves together.

880
00:50:26.031 --> 00:50:28.160
And the the correct to set something up

881
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:32.780
<v 3>to three steps ahead to know that if you grab the lapel this way,</v>

882
00:50:32.781 --> 00:50:36.170
the guy's going to try to shake it off that way and that exposes this,

883
00:50:36.171 --> 00:50:37.280
which exposes that.

884
00:50:37.281 --> 00:50:40.490
And then the next defense will expose this and then you keep going and going and

885
00:50:40.491 --> 00:50:41.900
going and going until you get them.

886
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:46.020
<v 1>It's so beautiful to watch that because it's like as if there's a preexisting</v>

887
00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:51.080
net or grid of interrelated signs that we'll work together and like as a white

888
00:50:52.531 --> 00:50:55.530
belt,
I've got three stripes now.
I was like,
thanks.

889
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.380
I was really hoping that by the time I came back on air,

890
00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:02.100
I'd have a blue belt and that could be closing in on it.
I'm on a train,

891
00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:06.630
I'm training free times a week privates and I'm attending two classes and what

892
00:51:06.631 --> 00:51:07.560
I've done.
That's great.

893
00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:11.250
Thanks a lot and was a significant step for me is like now in the classes when

894
00:51:11.251 --> 00:51:12.420
I'm sparring,
people are,

895
00:51:12.421 --> 00:51:16.080
don't try just in the handshake to manipulate them into go in easy.

896
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.770
How'd you look?
So lovely.
Oh Ralphie,
go then

897
00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.310
please try to manipulate people.
Yeah,

898
00:51:23.311 --> 00:51:26.560
like just a subtle gesture or something like that.
Right,
right,
right.

899
00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:31.500
Just trying to take it easy on me.
Don't hurt me.
Come on,
let go.
Ah.

900
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:33.690
Avoid big people.
Yeah.

901
00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:36.210
Sometimes like I try and stay down that white belt ended a room,

902
00:51:36.211 --> 00:51:39.870
but like now the more I do it,
like the more they coax me up near great.

903
00:51:39.871 --> 00:51:42.620
Big giant men,
like a lightness,
a guide.
I got like,

904
00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:46.740
they've sort of ones up out it like the hard end of purple belt and above Dave

905
00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:51.000
pull Busby and like there's people like their hands and their feet look

906
00:51:51.001 --> 00:51:54.840
different to my hands and feet as different than their hands and feet.

907
00:51:54.841 --> 00:51:58.500
It was different from mine is mine are to my daughters and I feel like,

908
00:51:58.501 --> 00:52:02.880
how am I supposed to ever do anything with these people?
Like hard water,

909
00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:04.920
like drowning in hard water,

910
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.840
the way they move and fold around me and I will just,

911
00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:12.200
the was boasted do and my breathing goes.
Yeah.

912
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:16.260
But the finis with other white belts is that,
uh,

913
00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:20.580
what I feel is like there is,
my ego comes back in because there I feel like,
no,

914
00:52:20.581 --> 00:52:21.240
I should be getting something.

915
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.440
The first time I've got choked out by another white belt I was,

916
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.710
I felt like I went into a room I'd not been in since I was 16 getting my ass

917
00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.540
kicked in,
in bus stops,
you know,
and stuff.

918
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:35.870
I felt like I was quiet for 24 hours just sitting and reflecting or no shit.

919
00:52:36.151 --> 00:52:39.450
And that just be done with it.
Like I said,
this is a combat sport.
This happens.

920
00:52:39.451 --> 00:52:41.100
You're going to experience why,
right.

921
00:52:41.101 --> 00:52:46.010
So it doesn't mean I'm a bad person that I've failed a no.

922
00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:49.920
You're going to have to get used to that.
If you're going to be is humiliation.

923
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:51.990
You get used to defeat,
but it's,
it's that humble

924
00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.410
<v 3>cooling is very good for you.
You know,
I've been,</v>

925
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:56.570
I don't know how many times I've been tapped out in my life,

926
00:52:56.571 --> 00:53:00.620
but it's probably more than a thousand.
Probably thousands.

927
00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:03.800
<v 1>No,
the,
yeah,
there.
Uh,</v>

928
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:06.860
so you sit there while I'll tell you about Jujitsu and the other and the other

929
00:53:06.861 --> 00:53:10.370
thing that's been good about it,
it's like when it is the other way,

930
00:53:10.371 --> 00:53:14.090
like I remember like a guide,
it was a big guy on top of me and like I was,
he,

931
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:16.580
he was in mount right.

932
00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.880
Like he won't actually applying a submission,

933
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:23.600
but there's just the sheer discomfort of having someone there.
Their body,

934
00:53:23.601 --> 00:53:26.220
their sweat,
their head,
abdomen,

935
00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:31.320
their reproductive organs that the justice system to theses in their bow on top

936
00:53:31.621 --> 00:53:35.780
of me.
I just nearly tapped out at,
but then he went to move to get onboarded,

937
00:53:35.781 --> 00:53:37.500
fooled.
Hang on a second.

938
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.850
There's a moment and I managed to escape from that and like the amount of energy

939
00:53:41.851 --> 00:53:43.260
that that releases were like,
fuck you.

940
00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:52.050
That's hilarious

941
00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:54.540
<v 3>feeling.</v>

942
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:58.880
It's also very satisfying to to defend against something that someone used to

943
00:53:58.881 --> 00:54:01.490
catch you with.
Like say if someone's a really good at taking your back,

944
00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.430
choked you a couple of times,
and then one time they take your back,

945
00:54:04.431 --> 00:54:08.360
but you defend and you get out.
You're like,
I got out.
There's an escape.

946
00:54:08.361 --> 00:54:09.860
I can make this.
I'm getting better.

947
00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:14.310
<v 1>I love being in the cave.
That meant we'll spice because why?</v>

948
00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:18.060
My technique was,
oh,
I'm not good at that.
Never bother trying.

949
00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:19.980
I'm not good at that kind of stuff.
Never bothered trying.

950
00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:24.150
So for me at this stage in my life to go and do something that I'm not good at

951
00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.960
this,
we have other men that is competitive.
They involve so much vulnerability,

952
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.920
failure and learning.
I'm thinking,
well,
you've got growing,

953
00:54:31.921 --> 00:54:32.880
you've got to be growing.
She'll,

954
00:54:32.881 --> 00:54:34.950
you're doing stuff that you never would have done before.

955
00:54:34.951 --> 00:54:38.880
Even turning up at a new place like I'm doing here in la and making those new

956
00:54:38.881 --> 00:54:41.910
relationships and doing that.
You know,
it's amazing for me.

957
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:46.080
Another thing I into is the integrity of it,
right?
But it was crisp,
clear,
uh,

958
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:49.680
black belt under Gracie.
Right.
And you came my teacher,

959
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:54.360
like if he gave me a blue belt that would look good,
man.
He'll be videoed.

960
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:58.020
I would tweet,
it'll be everywhere.
I'll Russell brand got blue belt is shit,

961
00:54:58.021 --> 00:55:02.310
mass work.
But no,
he doesn't do it out of integrity and respect for that,

962
00:55:02.311 --> 00:55:02.461
you know,

963
00:55:02.461 --> 00:55:07.461
it means more to him evidently then as simply the act of kindness though,

964
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:08.041
you know,

965
00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:12.090
so like what is nice to belong to something that has protected and valuable

966
00:55:12.091 --> 00:55:15.210
systems.
He did say to me,
you keep going by the end of the year blue belt.

967
00:55:15.211 --> 00:55:16.920
I think by like uh,
you know,

968
00:55:16.921 --> 00:55:20.310
it's not dished out like these nice to know that there's some kind of order or

969
00:55:20.311 --> 00:55:22.980
an area where Solibri manipulation,
charm human,

970
00:55:22.981 --> 00:55:24.390
none of those things or redundant.

971
00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:29.180
<v 3>No,
in Jujitsu it's very protected.
Anyone that gives out a bad belt,</v>

972
00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:32.030
it's very bad for their integrity.
It's the,
the,

973
00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:37.090
the school would lose face so badly in the community and you meet someone who's

974
00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:41.060
a Hicks and Gracie Brown belt,

975
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:45.950
that mother fucker's a Hicks and Gracie brown belt.
He is as legit as they get.

976
00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:47.780
They don't get any more legit.

977
00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:51.590
Like if you got to that point of Hicks and Gracie gives you a brown belt,

978
00:55:51.591 --> 00:55:55.160
it's just,
it's irrefutable and that's how it should be.

979
00:55:55.161 --> 00:55:58.690
And that's a beautiful thing about the art form is that it has this self

980
00:55:58.691 --> 00:56:02.630
correcting sort of aspect to it that when you roll,

981
00:56:02.631 --> 00:56:03.950
when you spar with each other,

982
00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:08.840
it your ability or lack of is exposed and there's no other way around it.

983
00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:13.260
Yeah,
that's good to not avoid that Tafe,

984
00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:17.360
but you'll be better.
You know,
you're,
you're a fit guy,
you're a healthy guy.

985
00:56:17.361 --> 00:56:20.810
If you just keep going and get off that fucking Vegan Diet and keep going.

986
00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:24.190
<v 1>I watched a documentary,
um,
called</v>

987
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.030
<v 3>what the health,
have you seen it?
It's like,
yeah,</v>

988
00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:29.230
it's filled with a lot of propaganda and got them.

989
00:56:29.231 --> 00:56:31.640
Those guys are getting like the Nazis,
I remember him,

990
00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:35.950
they used a lot of discredited studies and the,

991
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:39.430
there's a lot of epidemiology studies that'll connect things.

992
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.400
What does that mean?
Like an epidemic?
Well,
you know,

993
00:56:42.401 --> 00:56:45.120
we could pull up what the actual Tom,

994
00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.880
Jamie pulled something out in the algae.
But the way I would describe it as,

995
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:52.540
they would do these studies and essentially it would be,
they would,

996
00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:57.490
they would ask you what you eat on a daily basis.
How often do you mean?
How,

997
00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:01.990
and it's basically a survey.
And in,
in that survey they would say,
well,

998
00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:05.830
there's a direct correlation between people that eat meat and diabetes.

999
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.300
So let's pull up the definition.

1000
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:12.640
But the problem is what is causing here a branch of medicine,

1001
00:57:12.641 --> 00:57:14.020
which deals with incidents,

1002
00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:18.490
distribution and possible control of diseases and other factors relating to

1003
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:21.550
health.
Um,
so when they're,

1004
00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:25.340
when they're dealing with incidents,
right?
They're dealing with,
uh,

1005
00:57:25.341 --> 00:57:28.780
how often do you eat red meat?
How often do you eat this,
how often you eat that?

1006
00:57:28.781 --> 00:57:30.430
And then they find,
oh,

1007
00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:34.360
well there's more instances of diabetes and people that eat meat.
Okay,

1008
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:38.740
but is it people that eat meat and vegetables or is it people that eat meat and

1009
00:57:38.741 --> 00:57:40.940
vegetables and diet coke and,

1010
00:57:40.941 --> 00:57:44.260
and sugary sodas and ice cream and French fries.

1011
00:57:44.261 --> 00:57:47.290
And how are they eating their meat or their eating cheeseburgers for some

1012
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:50.290
bullshit fast food place.
Are they eating grass fed steak,

1013
00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:53.020
eating grass fed steak and vegetables.

1014
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.580
And there's very little evidence that shows there's anything wrong with eating

1015
00:57:57.581 --> 00:58:01.600
meat.
If you follow a normal healthy,
what they would call primal diet,

1016
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:06.280
cut out all the grains,
cut out all the sugar,
cut out all the bullshit,

1017
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:10.900
eat vegetables and meat.
And there's almost nothing.

1018
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.570
I mean the less you have some very unusual,

1019
00:58:13.571 --> 00:58:18.460
rare condition where you are either allergic to meat or you have some very

1020
00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:19.830
strange uh,

1021
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:23.560
digestive system where you find you have allergies to it or you have real

1022
00:58:23.561 --> 00:58:27.250
problems digesting it or you have real problems with high cholesterol foods,

1023
00:58:27.251 --> 00:58:31.660
which is very rare as well.
Most of what you're getting is vegan propaganda.

1024
00:58:31.661 --> 00:58:35.500
People that want other people to be convinced that the way that they're living

1025
00:58:35.501 --> 00:58:38.480
as the correct way and that eating meat is,

1026
00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:41.230
is physically bad for you and it's causing all these harms.

1027
00:58:41.231 --> 00:58:45.130
What's causing all the harm for people physically is the modern American diet.

1028
00:58:45.131 --> 00:58:47.490
And that's been pretty established.
Yes,
that's right.

1029
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:50.180
And that there are clear ethical reasons to be Vegan in the,

1030
00:58:50.181 --> 00:58:53.380
it takes you out of the exploitation of animals.
But that documentary,

1031
00:58:53.381 --> 00:58:54.820
what the health that I watched was like an hour,

1032
00:58:54.821 --> 00:58:57.190
not be a vegetarian for years and this light and I've gone back and forth to

1033
00:58:57.191 --> 00:58:59.080
veganism because I felt God Jesus Christ,
man,

1034
00:58:59.081 --> 00:59:01.480
there's enough things in my life I'm not doing without not being at.

1035
00:59:01.481 --> 00:59:05.110
I have an egg without feeling guilty for pasture raised eggs.

1036
00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:06.700
If you get them from a good farm,

1037
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.690
the chickens are just hanging out chickens in my God and they'll confident in

1038
00:59:10.691 --> 00:59:15.170
these animals.
And the one by one,
slowly my dog to eliminate in

1039
00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:22.010
Tampa for last,
nine of them to coyotes just last month,
maybe two months

1040
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:25.010
<v 2>ago.
That's a pretty heavy.
So it was a heavy toll.
Yeah.</v>

1041
00:59:25.011 --> 00:59:27.920
Well we had a fire out here and the chicken coop burnt down.

1042
00:59:27.921 --> 00:59:30.740
We've got a smaller chicken coop and the coyotes figured out how to get into it

1043
00:59:30.741 --> 00:59:33.620
when we're at home.
And we came home to just feathers everywhere.

1044
00:59:33.621 --> 00:59:38.360
It was disgusting.
Brutal.
They're brutal little monsters.
It's coyotes.
Yeah.

1045
00:59:38.361 --> 00:59:40.360
Yeah.
You know,
I'm governable there.

1046
00:59:40.361 --> 00:59:43.430
The reason why we don't have rats everywhere too.
All right.
So yeah,

1047
00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:47.660
<v 1>Goliath and don king was right.
So like,
hey though,
um,</v>

1048
00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:52.170
the thing about that Vegan documentary mate is there,
it,

1049
00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:56.500
it tuned in to my preexisting belief when it said stuff like,
oh,

1050
00:59:56.501 --> 00:59:58.370
the diabetes association,

1051
00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:02.290
they are funded by these meat and dairy organizations in these pharmaceutical

1052
01:00:02.291 --> 01:00:04.690
companies to cancer organizations.

1053
01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.360
Similarly accepts donations from these organizations.

1054
01:00:07.361 --> 01:00:12.361
And it made me recognize like my preexisting idea that I come to it with is like

1055
01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:15.980
that whole pyramid of these are the things you should eat,
bread,
milk,

1056
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:19.900
just where the figs that it was easy and cheap to produce and that we're

1057
01:00:19.901 --> 01:00:20.734
profitable.

1058
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:24.440
<v 2>Think that they really did use to think that bread wouldn't and grains are the</v>

1059
01:00:24.441 --> 01:00:27.410
most important thing.
You think they felt that?
I think they did.

1060
01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.610
I think they thought it was,

1061
01:00:28.611 --> 01:00:32.510
it was filling and it provided energy and I don't think they understood well.

1062
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.120
There was no talk of gluten intolerance when we were young.

1063
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:40.150
It didn't exist and there was no understanding of excess carbs and excess carbs

1064
01:00:40.221 --> 01:00:44.570
leads to excess body weight and it makes,
it makes you store fat.

1065
01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:48.140
People didn't think about it that way.
They didn't understand it.
There was,

1066
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:51.030
the thing about nutrition is in nutrition,
science is a,

1067
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:55.390
it's a body of knowledge that's constantly added to yeah,
I'm in fact pat,

1068
01:00:55.430 --> 01:01:00.380
<v 1>it's,
most things are,
who knows what misapprehensions and ignorance.
We toil.</v>

1069
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:03.870
And that will be revealed with,
do you do any,
uh,

1070
01:01:03.871 --> 01:01:07.250
I feel like I've heard you talk about hormone stuff.

1071
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:10.460
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
I do hormone replacement therapy.
What type of things?</v>

1072
01:01:10.461 --> 01:01:12.440
Testosterone and human growth hormone.

1073
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:16.010
You have to give yourself a jap and now you get in the thigh,
thigh,

1074
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.080
you won't do the arts apps and put pride.

1075
01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:23.910
That's for Mrs Rogan
touch that.

1076
01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:28.710
It ties right there.
It's easy to grab when you're putting your ass.

1077
01:01:28.711 --> 01:01:33.050
It's just like an awkward two.
Farmable um,
yeah,

1078
01:01:33.051 --> 01:01:37.360
but they also have,
um,
taking whole light.
So you're taking growth hormone,

1079
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:42.510
you're not noticed any negative side effects or you get your blood monitored.

1080
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.130
You know,
when you,
when you're doing something like that.
This,

1081
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:49.250
this is also if you're a person that has addictive problems,
addiction problems,

1082
01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:53.580
which I don't necessarily have them as much with substances,
but um,
uh,

1083
01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:57.530
well you saw with video games when you got here at the video game problem that I

1084
01:01:57.531 --> 01:02:02.080
have match that dark room.
You and your party sway and pie.

1085
01:02:02.081 --> 01:02:06.110
I didn't baffled by the real world one to um,
martial arts.

1086
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.380
I've been addicted to martial arts.
I've been addicted to playing pool.

1087
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:13.550
I get addicted to getting good at things.
I get it very addicted to things.

1088
01:02:13.551 --> 01:02:16.640
If there's something that I get obsessed with,
like Jujitsu or whatever it is,

1089
01:02:16.641 --> 01:02:20.460
I get obsessed and that's all I think about all day long.
I just had,
I just,

1090
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.180
you know,
it's not healthy,
but with hormones,

1091
01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:27.240
you want to make sure that you don't overdose yourself.

1092
01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:32.460
You want to make sure that you stay within a very narrow range where your,

1093
01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:33.361
you know your,

1094
01:02:33.361 --> 01:02:38.361
you have what are the healthy levels of a person that's in their late twenties

1095
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:44.490
that's really what you want.
You don't want to have hyper human levels,

1096
01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:45.780
which some people do do

1097
01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:50.580
<v 0>hyper human.
You're going to create a nod ecosystem.
You're fucking up your body,</v>

1098
01:02:50.581 --> 01:02:53.820
man.
You're just jolting yourself with all this extra shit.

1099
01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:57.710
He about to take this sweet lady thyroid.

1100
01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.990
Is that part of your system?
Yeah.
I have 'em.

1101
01:03:00.991 --> 01:03:05.360
I take Armour thyroid is actually made from pigs.
Thyroids.
Do you mean pigs?

1102
01:03:05.361 --> 01:03:09.910
Five relate to now hold on a minute.
What's happened to the pig?
Dead.
Dead.

1103
01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:11.810
They're long gone.
They're not so stressful.

1104
01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:16.470
Rev or lack of thei really teetering about all emasculated.
Well,

1105
01:03:16.471 --> 01:03:19.110
this is like,
so yeah,
I'm interested in this hormone stuff.

1106
01:03:19.111 --> 01:03:21.390
I'm interested in that,
but you know me,
I've got to be very,

1107
01:03:21.391 --> 01:03:26.370
very like cautious about Moodle or in stuff.

1108
01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:30.330
But if you have the exercise regimen that you're talking about,

1109
01:03:30.331 --> 01:03:31.970
I don't think you're gonna have got to get that blue pill.

1110
01:03:31.971 --> 01:03:36.090
I'm going to do what it takes.
Yeah,

1111
01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.770
bring me the thigh right out of it directly.
You should eat eggs though,
man.

1112
01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:44.150
<v 2>You really should.
You should eat.
You should eat some animal protein without,</v>

1113
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:48.530
I mean,
if you oppose the moral aspect of killing an animal,

1114
01:03:48.531 --> 01:03:50.000
which I totally understand and appreciate,

1115
01:03:50.001 --> 01:03:52.640
and that's what led me to become a hunter in the first place,

1116
01:03:52.641 --> 01:03:56.000
is that I was really uncomfortable watching these animal rights videos of

1117
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:58.160
factory farming.
I thought it was disgusting.
I'm just like,

1118
01:03:58.161 --> 01:04:00.510
I don't want to participate in this.
It's reprehensible.

1119
01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.010
Hunting's a different thing.
Men.
To me,
hunting is this intense.

1120
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:05.960
It's very spiritual in a way.

1121
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:08.660
I mean people don't get it because they see you celebrating when it's over

1122
01:04:08.661 --> 01:04:10.550
because it's very,
very,

1123
01:04:10.551 --> 01:04:15.551
very difficult to close in on a wild animal in mostly elk.

1124
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:19.970
Well elks,
my favorite for two reasons.
One,
it's very delicious,
super nutritious.

1125
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:23.210
Also,
if I shoot one elk,
I could eat it for like eight months.

1126
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:27.920
<v 0>Well freezing and freezing them breathing out.</v>

1127
01:04:27.921 --> 01:04:31.940
Stalking and elk on the plains.
Where are you let near where you live.

1128
01:04:31.941 --> 01:04:34.790
You just go to,
are you Charles Grant Travel?

1129
01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.960
<v 2>Yeah.
Well you do travel on bikes.
If you a white tail hunt,</v>

1130
01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.750
a lot of times she would go into the woods with bikes cause they don't leave a

1131
01:04:41.751 --> 01:04:44.820
scent the way your feet do,
you know?
And um,

1132
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:48.280
animals don't associate the sound of a bike the way they associate it with like

1133
01:04:48.290 --> 01:04:50.150
the sound of stepping bipedal

1134
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:54.830
<v 0>hominid stepping towards evolve Ip.
Yeah.
They see you on a bike.</v>

1135
01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.500
They didn't even freak out as much.
Delightful.
Never seen that before.

1136
01:04:57.501 --> 01:05:00.310
What's that Brian?
What are these things?
Yeah.

1137
01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:04.780
Elk or they like herd animals sees,
you see like a herd.
Yeah.
You see her

1138
01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:07.830
<v 2>heard of them.
And to try to figure out which way the wind's blowing.</v>

1139
01:05:07.831 --> 01:05:10.250
And you tried to get close to them.
Is this a video of us?
Yeah,

1140
01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:12.720
<v 0>video house from a beautiful place.
I mean</v>

1141
01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:17.980
that's an elk now the thing is you've me,
I see

1142
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.720
<v 1>that elk there and I saw a feel like a silver.</v>

1143
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.330
I've watched too much Disney.
Um,
you know,

1144
01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:27.680
like I see that elk and I feel like I'm Bambi literally,
you know,

1145
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.970
like I don't have it.
Like is that early in the morning?
You look tired?
Not Tired.

1146
01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:36.640
My now late afternoon actually.
Can you tell those late afternoon?
Yeah.

1147
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:41.970
Like say it like I have from that position I couldn't like I would love the game

1148
01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:45.790
of being able to him cause actually I've had to go down.
Gun Range is,

1149
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:48.940
it turns out I'm pretty good shot and it's nice to see that thing come back.

1150
01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:53.410
We've like holes around his abdomen and his head satisfied there.

1151
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:57.250
You've been dealt with paper man,
but,
but like the elk I couldn't,

1152
01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:02.280
I've got too much empathy in me that I couldn't deal with the feeling of after

1153
01:06:03.521 --> 01:06:07.840
it was shot.
I like it,
almost thinking about it,
the sentimentality of it.

1154
01:06:07.841 --> 01:06:11.260
I've sentimentalize it now,
you know,
at least I don't eat me and stuff like that.

1155
01:06:11.261 --> 01:06:14.590
So it's not like I have all those feelings of but can handle it in a packaged

1156
01:06:14.591 --> 01:06:19.150
portioned off way.
Yeah.
It's just I feel too much like,
oh,
that creature.

1157
01:06:19.151 --> 01:06:22.450
So what in your Ed,
when you're doing it,
when you're pulling the trigger,

1158
01:06:22.451 --> 01:06:24.610
you're not having what's going on in your mind.

1159
01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:26.190
<v 2>Well,
you,</v>

1160
01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:30.810
you only are hunting these mature animals that have already passed on their

1161
01:06:30.811 --> 01:06:31.644
genes.

1162
01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:36.630
You also are recognizing that if you are not killing these things,
they're not,

1163
01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:39.360
it's not like they're going to live forever.
Right.
They are.

1164
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:43.080
They live a short life,
a short life with a very violent death.

1165
01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:47.070
It's either wolves or mountain lions or bears or something's going to take them

1166
01:06:47.071 --> 01:06:47.904
out.
Yeah.

1167
01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.690
And what you're doing is essentially dipping your toe into the natural world.

1168
01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:53.700
And I've heard the argument that,
well,

1169
01:06:53.701 --> 01:06:56.520
this is ridiculous because everyone can't do that.
You know,

1170
01:06:56.550 --> 01:07:00.300
if everyone went out and hunted all the animals,
so would be no animal slept.

1171
01:07:00.301 --> 01:07:04.500
Which is true.
But,
um,
I'm not everyone,
so I don't,

1172
01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:07.170
<v 1>I'm going to use that if everyone did it.
Argument</v>

1173
01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.580
<v 2>argument because you,
you,
if you're encouraging people to hunt,</v>

1174
01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:14.810
it is kind of a good argument because it's not realistic.
It's not sustainable.

1175
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:19.820
But the other thing to recognize is that the reason why most of this wildlife

1176
01:07:19.821 --> 01:07:24.821
exists in the first was a lot of it was wiped out in the early 20th century from

1177
01:07:25.101 --> 01:07:29.030
um,
what they call market hunting.
And the late,
late 19th century,

1178
01:07:29.031 --> 01:07:33.530
early 20th century,
um,
they,
you know,
they didn't have refrigeration and,
uh,

1179
01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:36.830
it was hard to get food and we didn't have the same sort of large scale

1180
01:07:36.831 --> 01:07:41.240
agriculture that we have today.
And so when someone would want meat,

1181
01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:42.163
they would,
uh,

1182
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:45.470
someone who would either have to hunt it for you and you would go to the market

1183
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:49.670
and get that hunted food or a,
you would go out and do it yourself.

1184
01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:55.040
And they basically wiped out most of the wildlife in North America to the point

1185
01:07:55.041 --> 01:07:57.050
of extinction.
Whitetail deer,
elk,

1186
01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:01.540
they've been extirpated from the majority of their range in North American,

1187
01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:03.890
only been replaced.
And a few other places,

1188
01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:06.290
but the places would they be been replaced.

1189
01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:10.070
It's all through money that was generated through hunting tags all through

1190
01:08:10.071 --> 01:08:11.750
billions and billions of dollars.

1191
01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.890
There's a thing called the a Robertson Pickman I think that's it's called act,

1192
01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:20.090
<v 1>where a 10% if you buy hunting gear and equipment,</v>

1193
01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:24.180
10% of that money goes to habitat restoration.
Um,

1194
01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:29.450
making sure that a rangers and forest people get funded.

1195
01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.770
So there's a fishing game,
department gets funded and all of,

1196
01:08:33.771 --> 01:08:38.300
and also population conservation,
making sure that the populations are healthy,

1197
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:41.870
repopulating certain areas with elk and deer.

1198
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:46.160
And this has all been done through the money that's generated through hunting.

1199
01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:50.390
Yeah,
I can see that.
There's an looking at my own feelings towards it.

1200
01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.370
I can see that there's potentially,

1201
01:08:52.371 --> 01:08:57.371
I'm bringing a sentimentality to the idea of animals that's like amp for upper

1202
01:08:57.591 --> 01:09:01.400
morphic.
Yes.
Like I'm not,
oh,
you can't kill that.
It will abide.
It's babies.

1203
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:05.960
And I mean like thinking about things like that.
Um,
but will I,
you know,

1204
01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:10.961
I live in a rural area in Britain where like hunt in is normal and I wouldn't

1205
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:16.190
and agriculture is normal and I wouldn't get very far if I were sort of like you

1206
01:09:16.191 --> 01:09:18.440
can't shoot those pheasants,
look at their feathers,
they're beautiful.

1207
01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.340
And I mean like it wouldn't,

1208
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:23.650
it's not a health whatchu say whilst I like record in my cell,

1209
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:27.470
I couldn't do that because like I don't,
it messes me up on a sort of,

1210
01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:31.310
feels like a very sort of deep visceral level,
you know,
like,

1211
01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:35.540
but I feel that this is precisely the kind of territory where we have to look at

1212
01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:39.020
acknowledging and tolerate indifference between us.

1213
01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:43.250
This is where I feel like there's sort of these ossified polarized positions

1214
01:09:43.251 --> 01:09:47.570
between right and left are starting to take root because if someone like me who

1215
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.010
don't eat meat,
don't eat animal products and wouldn't hunt for ethical reasons,

1216
01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.830
starts trying to impose on other people now you shouldn't harm because if they

1217
01:09:55.831 --> 01:09:57.580
start having not watched Bambi,
you know,

1218
01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:01.100
like that's going to mean that people aren't able to explore who they are.

1219
01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.420
And so my po,

1220
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:08.470
I've let go of judging people around things that I don't agree with because I

1221
01:10:09.761 --> 01:10:12.710
reckon I know everything.
You know what I mean?
I'm this,
this is,

1222
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:17.330
this is about my morality is about how I behave and if people said to me,

1223
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:20.870
I'm thinking about going hunting,
I go,
well,
these are my feelings about it.

1224
01:10:20.871 --> 01:10:21.201
However,

1225
01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:24.830
though I just heard that it's hunting does contribute apparently to the survival

1226
01:10:24.831 --> 01:10:27.860
of some species and there is an argument that it's quite natural and indigenous

1227
01:10:27.861 --> 01:10:30.920
and it's probably a way of getting in contact with who we are.

1228
01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:32.960
It regionally as hunt in people.

1229
01:10:32.961 --> 01:10:36.500
It's an important part of our anthropological history and possibly a lot of the

1230
01:10:36.501 --> 01:10:41.000
condemnation of hunting is part of the rejection of who we used to be is we

1231
01:10:41.001 --> 01:10:44.750
become overly civilized and more and more detached from what it is to be human.

1232
01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:48.930
Whether that's sacred or pragmatic.
We don't know what human beings are anymore.

1233
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:52.550
We reject her own sexuality.
We reject our own bodies.
We reject,
you know,

1234
01:10:52.551 --> 01:10:57.140
we're trying to turn ourselves in these sort of cyborgs,
these emotionless,

1235
01:10:57.290 --> 01:11:01.760
sexless,
meaningless creatures.
Where is our passion,

1236
01:11:01.761 --> 01:11:04.520
where is our connection with the sacred?
They would go,
hold on.

1237
01:11:04.521 --> 01:11:08.920
Only after about hunting.
When are you going to stop talking?
Never gave me an,

1238
01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:13.320
in Palmer we were with my belief system on all things like I,

1239
01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:17.960
so I don't feel like it ain't where again,
a judging people by.
Like I,

1240
01:11:17.961 --> 01:11:22.350
I'm interested as well with this.
I keep bringing up the subject of DMT.

1241
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:24.180
Like what?

1242
01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:29.280
I guess what I want to know about is like,
cause I,
I'm,
you know,

1243
01:11:29.281 --> 01:11:31.350
obviously a person in recovery,
I don't drink,
I don't take drugs,

1244
01:11:31.351 --> 01:11:34.590
haven't done for a long time and are recognized for certain people.

1245
01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.970
They can't do it safely.
Psychedelics and hallucinogens,

1246
01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:42.390
it seemed to me exist in a realm outside of that because they're not about,

1247
01:11:42.391 --> 01:11:44.160
they're not pleasure seeking.

1248
01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.190
There's like seem to me like it's a spiritual portal.
However,

1249
01:11:47.191 --> 01:11:51.360
I'm a crafty bastard when it comes to this stuff and I'm always looking for an

1250
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:55.800
in,
you know,
when I see your cannabis treasure trove over there.

1251
01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:57.900
I mean that is some,
yeah,
as you said,

1252
01:11:57.910 --> 01:12:02.430
let Raiders of the lost Ark Stuff and I'm holding in my hand now the CBD rich

1253
01:12:02.431 --> 01:12:06.130
cannabis soft gels clasp in it.
You know,
so like I'm saying,

1254
01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:09.000
I'm worried that that is a gateway that CVD,

1255
01:12:09.001 --> 01:12:12.510
which is not necessarily psychoactive psychoactive.
It's not,

1256
01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.100
but it does help you with anxiety.

1257
01:12:14.101 --> 01:12:17.940
It helps a lot of people because it alleviates a lot of inflammation which tends

1258
01:12:17.941 --> 01:12:21.900
to have a corresponding impact on,
on your anxiety.

1259
01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:25.710
How do I say this says here,
11 milligrams of THC.
Does that mean,

1260
01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:29.790
I mean it says THC.
It does say that the ponds are probably a wonder one.

1261
01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:33.120
There's the one to one or ed tech 18 to one or 11.

1262
01:12:33.121 --> 01:12:36.210
It says there's an 1,101 has a couple of different ones in that box.
Oh,

1263
01:12:36.211 --> 01:12:40.770
I give you,
almost give you the wrong one.
Pack a snack.

1264
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:43.560
Don't take that.
This one goes back in this one.

1265
01:12:43.561 --> 01:12:47.640
This one's way more powerful than you seem to seem very relaxed and free from

1266
01:12:47.641 --> 01:12:50.180
anxiety.
I will say that.
Um,
but like,

1267
01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:53.420
so like what I suppose I'm interested in because I listen,

1268
01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.700
I meditate in the whole lot.
I meditate a lot.
I'm doing all these things.

1269
01:12:56.701 --> 01:12:59.100
I mean I experiencing transcendent states,

1270
01:12:59.101 --> 01:13:02.910
I'm experiencing what it's like to not feel attached to my identity as Russell,

1271
01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:04.380
who are you before?
You are Russell,

1272
01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:09.030
who are you before you identify yourself as a man in England,
who are you?

1273
01:13:09.031 --> 01:13:11.610
Who is the person who is the consciousness?
Who is the awareness?

1274
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:15.750
And when I listened to say Terence Mckenna talking about his experiences in

1275
01:13:15.751 --> 01:13:17.610
Psychedelia as such lamp and we've certainly,

1276
01:13:17.611 --> 01:13:21.720
we've seen entity and we've so many philosophical connotations and the way that

1277
01:13:21.721 --> 01:13:26.220
he uses the information he's getting from hallucinogenics experiences to

1278
01:13:26.221 --> 01:13:29.460
speculate on how we should organize society,
what it,

1279
01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.230
what the implications are for freedom.

1280
01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:35.220
He's refusal to accept that there are certain kinds of experiences that should

1281
01:13:35.221 --> 01:13:36.870
be prohibited.
That it's ridiculous.

1282
01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:41.490
The adults should be prevented from having that.
I,
I'm fascinated.
I'm also,

1283
01:13:41.491 --> 01:13:45.300
I suppose part of my bias is I love anything that gets me out of my head.

1284
01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:47.430
I feel a tremendous sense of relief,

1285
01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:51.960
whether it's through meditation or even sports or sex being relieved of the

1286
01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:56.360
burden of the constantly thinking mind.
But when I hear like those,
um,

1287
01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:01.350
Vivian IX descriptions of DMT realm or our West era,

1288
01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:04.950
I think something in the hungers for that hungers for it.

1289
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.110
Do you worry that you're trying to get intoxicated?
You were,
that you're,

1290
01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:11.980
but you're trying to find a loophole.
Yeah,
cause I am doing that.
I'm really

1291
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:12.991
<v 0>looking for a loophole.</v>

1292
01:14:12.991 --> 01:14:17.560
It's like I'm going around like a sort of a trash lawyer looking for some way to

1293
01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:21.010
get into.
Is there,
hold on a second.
What about this crash lawyer?

1294
01:14:21.011 --> 01:14:22.990
That's a great way of putting it.
Yeah.

1295
01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:26.800
I mean I know people that have problems with addiction that have done

1296
01:14:26.801 --> 01:14:28.660
psychedelics and didn't have a problem,

1297
01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:33.530
but I'm sure some people have had problems and I don't know about them.

1298
01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:36.850
DMT is interesting in that,
first of all,
it's very quick.

1299
01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:41.200
The experiences only about 15 minutes,
20 minutes Max.
And it's also,

1300
01:14:41.201 --> 01:14:42.790
it's not necessary.

1301
01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:46.690
It's not an intoxicant and the way that you would think about traditionally you

1302
01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:50.980
are still you in the face of this experience.
And I think,

1303
01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:55.120
I think it's some sort of a chemical gateway.
That's what I think.

1304
01:14:55.121 --> 01:15:00.070
I think there's a gateway in your mind that can lead to some other dimension

1305
01:15:00.071 --> 01:15:03.220
that's probably there all the time.
If there is a,
uh,

1306
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:08.910
omnipresent continually existing realm that human beings aren't accessing

1307
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:10.360
because of that particular buyer,

1308
01:15:10.361 --> 01:15:14.470
chemical formulation of consciousness as it is in this point in our evolution

1309
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.220
and that we can get there.
And it seems as like,
you know,

1310
01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:20.980
I've heard Terence Mckenna say it's more real,
it's more real.

1311
01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:23.770
There's stuff in there,
you know,
and excuse me.

1312
01:15:23.771 --> 01:15:25.760
And when he talks about them beings,
you know,
like the,

1313
01:15:25.761 --> 01:15:28.810
he describes herself dribbling basketballs,

1314
01:15:28.811 --> 01:15:32.220
creating life Faberge egg like an I device.

1315
01:15:32.221 --> 01:15:35.360
He's through vibration and there to see it,
to do it.
I never saw it.

1316
01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:39.010
It's called the machine elves.
He's called them all sorts of different things.

1317
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:43.480
The way I've described them is there the geometric patterns made out of love and

1318
01:15:43.481 --> 01:15:46.920
understanding,
say the cmos.
So you've read,

1319
01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:50.150
you can look at a geometrical pattern and read meaning into it.

1320
01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:54.280
It had an emotional quality.
They're made out of something and they move,

1321
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:56.800
they change like they don't stay what they are.

1322
01:15:56.801 --> 01:16:00.130
They're constantly evolving in front of you into something more and more

1323
01:16:00.131 --> 01:16:04.960
beautiful.
It's very weird.
What did it make you feel
like?

1324
01:16:04.961 --> 01:16:08.380
I knew nothing.
That was the most profound aspect.

1325
01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:13.180
All of the stuff that you concentrate on everyday is nonsense and there is some

1326
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:18.160
other thing that's connected that's probably influencing this world and it's

1327
01:16:18.161 --> 01:16:21.280
probably what people see when they have near death experiences.

1328
01:16:21.281 --> 01:16:23.020
The depictions of the afterlife.

1329
01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.220
I mean that's probably what it all is and religious experience is when profits

1330
01:16:27.221 --> 01:16:30.340
are talking about,
oh my God,
I went into this railroad.
There's these beings.

1331
01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:31.990
They've told me we're all one.

1332
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.340
We cover scholars in Jerusalem or connecting Moses,

1333
01:16:36.341 --> 01:16:39.970
his experience with the burning Bush to the acacia tree,
Acacia tree,

1334
01:16:39.971 --> 01:16:41.440
which is rich and DMT.

1335
01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:46.270
The burning Bush is with God was to Moses and that through this burning Bush,

1336
01:16:46.271 --> 01:16:49.690
he came out with these 10 commandments of how people should live their lives.

1337
01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:55.140
I mean that easily could have been just a very convoluted sort of translation of

1338
01:16:57.191 --> 01:17:00.840
a DMT trip suddenly.
And also when you think of it,

1339
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:04.150
certainly there are archetype or images that seem to be repeated throughout

1340
01:17:04.151 --> 01:17:09.151
ancient cultures aren't an archaic stories that seem to refer to the potential

1341
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:12.320
plant experience is to affect consciousness.

1342
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:17.360
Even the garden of Eden do not eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge,

1343
01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:22.250
otherwise you will become as gods,
you know,
uh,
like I sensed that now if,

1344
01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:26.390
if there is some realm that we can reach through that experience,

1345
01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:30.410
but seeing that puts into perspective everything else we experienced on the

1346
01:17:30.411 --> 01:17:33.350
material realm.
And that thing seems to,
in your words,

1347
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:36.890
be MNA in love and understanding while ever changing,

1348
01:17:36.891 --> 01:17:40.770
completely formless and communicate in love and understanding it for,

1349
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:45.290
I can't help but think that that should become our pri,

1350
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:46.190
Ori,

1351
01:17:46.190 --> 01:17:51.080
to have a relationship with that realm and to bring about that experience.

1352
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:53.100
I don't even mean in a literal way.
Cause even terrorism,

1353
01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:55.790
Mckenna said there were some people vulnerable selves.

1354
01:17:55.791 --> 01:17:59.420
He was probably referring to people like me that probably shouldn't mess around

1355
01:17:59.421 --> 01:18:02.690
with that kind of stuff.
Really talking about people's kids,
a friend.
Right.

1356
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:06.580
Which he believed he had,
by the way.
Did he?
Yeah,
he,
he,

1357
01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:10.160
he had some very unique perspectives on schizophrenia and the,

1358
01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:13.070
the way people interact with the world itself.

1359
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.610
I think if we lived in a healthy world,
uh,

1360
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:18.920
healthy civilization that had a healthy relationship with psychoactive

1361
01:18:18.921 --> 01:18:23.090
substances,
we'd probably have centers where you would have a legitimate Sharman,

1362
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:28.250
a medical advisor and someone would take you through a guided experience.

1363
01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:31.400
We're doing that now with ketamine.

1364
01:18:31.401 --> 01:18:36.401
There's a lot of people that are very depressed that are having these physician

1365
01:18:36.441 --> 01:18:41.441
controlled ketamine experiences that have had a profound effect on their

1366
01:18:41.541 --> 01:18:42.080
depression.

1367
01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.600
My friend Neil Brennan has gone through several of them and he was the,

1368
01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:48.330
he's a comedian,
a very funny comedian.
So when he was describing it,

1369
01:18:48.331 --> 01:18:50.720
it was hilarious.
I was going to a doctor's office,

1370
01:18:50.721 --> 01:18:53.000
a tripping his fucking balls off,
you know,

1371
01:18:53.001 --> 01:18:57.320
and the doctors shooting them up with intermuscular ketamine.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1372
01:18:57.321 --> 01:18:59.630
And he's having these insane,
so yeah,
I go,

1373
01:18:59.631 --> 01:19:02.540
so you're having psychedelic experiences like,
oh yeah,

1374
01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:06.800
that's driving.
It was really funny.
Um,

1375
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:11.890
I mean tripping his fucking balls off in these whatever states that ketamine,

1376
01:19:13.581 --> 01:19:15.560
I've never experienced ketamine.
I don't know what it does,

1377
01:19:15.561 --> 01:19:20.561
but it's apparently profoundly hallucinogenic and you have these wild crazy

1378
01:19:21.141 --> 01:19:26.141
experiences on it and for whatever reason it has a great impact on depression

1379
01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:28.760
for a lot of people.
I think it's a perspective enhancer,

1380
01:19:28.761 --> 01:19:31.220
but it also does something to rewire the mind.

1381
01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:35.810
Some of these suggest is that mental illness is a response to our material

1382
01:19:35.811 --> 01:19:38.630
conditions.
Whether that's,
whether that mentally,
honestly schizophrenia,

1383
01:19:38.631 --> 01:19:42.260
depression or addiction people,
look,

1384
01:19:42.261 --> 01:19:44.510
I don't hang on a minute this in are we supposed to live?

1385
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:48.890
I took that came in one time towards the end of my using and as usual,

1386
01:19:48.891 --> 01:19:51.350
it's not in the right type of environment should be doing stuff like that in a

1387
01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:54.090
nightclub.
You need to be under that should manic conditions,

1388
01:19:54.150 --> 01:19:57.140
whiteout guy or wherever.
Whoever nominated a shaming.

1389
01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:01.610
But I felt like it was like going into a tunnel made of sound and like having to

1390
01:20:01.611 --> 01:20:04.830
navigate,
I'll start off,
shit,
I'm still in reality.
Why am I going to do it?

1391
01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:10.960
As my self consciousness becomes a noise instead of a string of words and signs

1392
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:13.560
am I'm in a Gad,
his place,
you know?

1393
01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:17.550
So like for me it's clear that drugs were never meant to be recreational.

1394
01:20:17.551 --> 01:20:20.280
In fact,
they never was.
I was never,
hey man,
this is crazy.

1395
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:23.370
I was always an unfucking pain.
I need some shit there.
Helped me out.

1396
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:25.690
Otherwise I am can probably kill myself,
you know?

1397
01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:28.920
So like it was a way of holding that stuff.
Our arms limp.

1398
01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:33.480
So I guess my renewed curiosity around DMT in Iowa and Ios,

1399
01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:36.210
Gha and other sort of plant medicines and not,
you know that.

1400
01:20:36.211 --> 01:20:39.330
Do you know Daniel Pinchbeck and like them guys?
They're sort of part of that.

1401
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:42.850
I'm curious about it cause I guess I'm continually trying to find a way where

1402
01:20:42.851 --> 01:20:45.690
someone go,
right,
here's a way where we can do it,
where it's sort of safe.

1403
01:20:45.691 --> 01:20:47.820
And I've heard of other people in recovery doing it.

1404
01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.620
And when I think about what my motivation is,

1405
01:20:49.621 --> 01:20:53.370
is when I hear people talking about and my own and my own recollections of

1406
01:20:53.371 --> 01:20:54.720
experiencing what felt like God,

1407
01:20:54.721 --> 01:20:57.870
and by God I mean a sense of oneness and that my individual identity isn't my

1408
01:20:57.871 --> 01:21:00.870
real identity and I'm connected to everything and love is the most important

1409
01:21:00.871 --> 01:21:01.910
thing.
You know?

1410
01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:05.760
I want a real experience of that so that when I'm out in the world,

1411
01:21:05.761 --> 01:21:09.840
I can remember when I'm driving or when I'm dealing with people or if I'm buying

1412
01:21:09.841 --> 01:21:13.560
something or if I'm feeling inferior or feeling superior that like you said,

1413
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:17.020
this is bullshit.
This is like a secondary reality.
Don't let it govern you.

1414
01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:20.250
You know,
as someone that's been seduced by fame or personal life,

1415
01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.800
if I get this puns film,
then everyone's going to love me.
Oh,

1416
01:21:22.801 --> 01:21:24.360
if this standup set goes well,
you know,

1417
01:21:24.361 --> 01:21:27.690
like a person that's placed all of my wellbeing outside of myself,

1418
01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:31.320
there's certain knowledge that there is an inner connection that will take care

1419
01:21:31.321 --> 01:21:32.760
of you that's accessible.

1420
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.890
I guess I'm hungry to sort of feel it in a way that's like,
oh my God,

1421
01:21:37.891 --> 01:21:40.980
now there is no doubt.
So in the sense is a crisis of faith,

1422
01:21:40.981 --> 01:21:45.981
not crisis psychedelic states that you could achieve without taking anything.

1423
01:21:46.230 --> 01:21:50.160
I mean,
you could certainly get there in a flotation tank.

1424
01:21:50.190 --> 01:21:52.710
You could get there through holotropic breathing.

1425
01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:55.800
I've never done coon Daleney Yoga,

1426
01:21:55.801 --> 01:21:58.920
but apparently the people that get really deep into Kundalini Yoga,

1427
01:21:58.921 --> 01:22:00.870
you can literally have DMT trips.

1428
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:06.030
I know I have friends that have done DMT and have experienced DMT trips through

1429
01:22:06.031 --> 01:22:09.780
Kundalini.
Yeah.
But you have to be really dedicated.
I mean,
there's a lot of time,

1430
01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:11.230
a lot of time,

1431
01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:15.930
a lot of energy and you have to really understand the methods and follow them to

1432
01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:20.010
a t and you can achieve these altered states of consciousness that are

1433
01:22:20.011 --> 01:22:23.100
apparently not from my personal experience,

1434
01:22:23.101 --> 01:22:25.860
but from people telling me incredibly profound.
Yeah.

1435
01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:28.450
I mean I've had comparable things.
I guess it's,
you know,

1436
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:32.640
the difference between feeling something that's that overwhelming that gives you

1437
01:22:32.641 --> 01:22:34.270
no choice.
You know like there's like,

1438
01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.540
it's not like in a Kundalini you've got to do these breast correctly,

1439
01:22:36.541 --> 01:22:40.320
you've got to sit,
there you go try again.
He had done quite a bit of Kundalini.

1440
01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:44.100
Well what for me it feels like what I've felt quite a lot yoga,

1441
01:22:44.101 --> 01:22:48.450
clea and meditatively is a cessation of what I would call my individual

1442
01:22:48.451 --> 01:22:51.670
consciousness.
Like,
oh I'm not this,
this isn't who I am.

1443
01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:55.650
This is just a temporary experience and all of the value systems of our world

1444
01:22:55.830 --> 01:23:00.830
are built upon these primal drives in collaboration with a culture that likes to

1445
01:23:01.171 --> 01:23:05.230
stratify people and manage people and operates like a massive farm where it's

1446
01:23:05.231 --> 01:23:06.070
easier to keep people

1447
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:08.320
<v 1>to give our operating in these kinds of ways systemically.</v>

1448
01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:12.700
I've still felt rushes of that like a certain word.
Less clarity.

1449
01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:16.120
If you could imagine me having anything that was wordless even for a moment and

1450
01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:19.630
like an in that space.
They is great pace.

1451
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:24.130
So I suppose get what's turning me on about the,
like the DMT in Ios,

1452
01:23:24.131 --> 01:23:28.180
caffeine is that the way narrow advised that they are going to meet characters

1453
01:23:28.181 --> 01:23:31.750
and stuff like that and it's,
and it's going to be playing and beyond doubt,

1454
01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:36.390
you know,
cause I suppose what profit do you know like whether it,
you know,

1455
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:40.780
when a profit returns from there,
whether it's the burning Bush or the cave,

1456
01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:44.770
they come back and they say all this stuff that you're taking seriously is not

1457
01:23:44.771 --> 01:23:46.360
real.
There's this other realm.

1458
01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:50.950
Start prioritizing it or you are going to live in hell on earth if you're going

1459
01:23:50.951 --> 01:23:52.720
to be governed by your materialistic drives,

1460
01:23:52.721 --> 01:23:54.970
your sexual drive and it's going to imprison you.

1461
01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.630
And it turns out that they're bright as I would like,
you know,

1462
01:23:58.631 --> 01:24:02.050
I suppose what I'm after because I'm partly,
you know,

1463
01:24:02.051 --> 01:24:05.500
on a super like on one level influenced by what you're doing and how you've

1464
01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:09.220
created your own light,
your create your own business and your own success.

1465
01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:13.960
This symbiosis of stand up and the podcast and like it's become like a sort of a

1466
01:24:13.961 --> 01:24:17.440
lifestyle brand in a sense.
Joe.
Like,
you know,
I'm sort of like,
yeah,
I don't,

1467
01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:21.430
I don't want to be continually dragged into these color like working within

1468
01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:24.370
institutions.
Like,
you know,
I,
I'm over here doing a bloody,

1469
01:24:24.371 --> 01:24:27.880
I'm doing ballers and I'm bloody glad to be over here doing ballers and working

1470
01:24:27.881 --> 01:24:32.510
with the rock.
And I've got a funny story about that if you want it like a,
um,

1471
01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:37.510
but like,
uh,
you know,
like really what interests me is like,
can I be dead?

1472
01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:40.270
Can I dedicate my life to humorously,

1473
01:24:40.271 --> 01:24:44.980
communicate in spiritual information and indeed starting to live it.

1474
01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:48.070
So like that.
And I suppose what that would mean is,
you know,
I'm getting better,

1475
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:52.360
but I'm not a person who's obsessed with porn or sex or drugs or weapons,
like,

1476
01:24:52.361 --> 01:24:55.330
you know,
to become it,
to become what you actually are,

1477
01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:56.680
to recognize that we're all different.

1478
01:24:56.681 --> 01:25:00.880
Your perfect realization of you is going to involve hun in and all of these

1479
01:25:00.881 --> 01:25:02.740
things that you've created for your gift.

1480
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:05.470
And that my perfect version of me is going to involve all of this.

1481
01:25:05.471 --> 01:25:08.350
And not everyone needs to build sort of empires or entertainment industries or

1482
01:25:08.351 --> 01:25:08.741
wherever.

1483
01:25:08.741 --> 01:25:12.910
But all of us are on some journey to self actualization and realization.

1484
01:25:12.911 --> 01:25:16.080
There's individual as our fingerprints and as natural as a seed turning into a

1485
01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:19.420
tree.
And if we don't have a way of accessing that and the one that we're

1486
01:25:19.421 --> 01:25:22.150
dissatisfied,
no wonder we're tired.
There's an opioid epidemic,
they want to,

1487
01:25:22.151 --> 01:25:24.250
people are bored and angry and lonely.

1488
01:25:24.570 --> 01:25:28.890
<v 2>Well,
I think what you can do is be yourself.</v>

1489
01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:30.660
And what you can do is express yourself.

1490
01:25:30.661 --> 01:25:34.320
And what you can do is constantly seek to improve and grow and you are doing

1491
01:25:34.321 --> 01:25:37.260
those things.
So if you're saying,
can I do these things?

1492
01:25:37.261 --> 01:25:41.340
Can I be comedic and spiritual and what you're doing it right.

1493
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:44.340
So what can be done?
So it's don't,
you're doing it,
you know,

1494
01:25:44.341 --> 01:25:45.810
it's all just a matter of what,

1495
01:25:46.170 --> 01:25:50.280
whether or not your satisfied with your progress and where you are and who you

1496
01:25:50.281 --> 01:25:51.600
are and how you express yourself.

1497
01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.270
<v 1>So your pursuit for excellence.</v>

1498
01:25:53.271 --> 01:25:56.840
When you're saying I've got get better at Bjj or archery or hunting or whatever,

1499
01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:59.300
that isn't coupled with a sort of sense

1500
01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:04.010
<v 2>because you're not fucking good enough.
I've got this wonderment.</v>

1501
01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:08.930
<v 0>I love it.
Julie joy in it.
And there's enthusiasm.
I mean,</v>

1502
01:26:08.931 --> 01:26:12.830
in everything and archery in particular,
it's very,
you know,

1503
01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:15.920
there's that book Zen and the art of archery,
which is a,

1504
01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:19.400
it's an interesting book.
Uh,
it's,
you know,

1505
01:26:19.401 --> 01:26:21.200
I mean I think there's some really great points to it,

1506
01:26:21.201 --> 01:26:26.180
but that state of mind that you get when you release an arrow and that Arrow

1507
01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:29.480
perfectly fine,
it's mark really is Zan.
It's,

1508
01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.890
it requires so much concentration and focus and technique that you really don't

1509
01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:35.370
think about other things.
Beautiful.

1510
01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:38.090
And it's cleansing and a lot of ways it's mine cleansing.

1511
01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:42.560
I find Jujitsu to be very similar in that way too,
that it's so all encompassing.

1512
01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.630
It's so,
there's so much on the line,

1513
01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:49.250
it's so difficult to do that while it's happening.
You're freeing your mind up.

1514
01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:49.491
I mean,

1515
01:26:49.491 --> 01:26:54.491
I think of video games in the same way and that's bizarre on all of those things

1516
01:26:55.251 --> 01:26:58.580
suggest a transmission between the inner and outer world,
isn't it?

1517
01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:01.490
You're looking at their bulls eye and then,
oh my God,

1518
01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:05.390
I've made this thing traverse time and space.
Or Bjj,

1519
01:27:05.391 --> 01:27:08.510
I've been shown again and again how we execute this triangle and I've just

1520
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:10.730
actually done it against resistance.

1521
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:15.680
It's a amazing to feel that it's amazing to feel that that your inner life can

1522
01:27:15.681 --> 01:27:17.540
express yourself in the material world,

1523
01:27:17.541 --> 01:27:22.541
whatever we'll wherever you're looking to explore that and to test yourself and

1524
01:27:22.611 --> 01:27:27.440
when you test yourself and you have to figure your way through something or

1525
01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:31.520
change the path because the path you were on was unsuccessful.

1526
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:34.940
When you're doing that,
it's,
it's really good for the mind.
And for the,

1527
01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:39.530
I hesitate to say the spirit because I think that word spirituality so beaten

1528
01:27:39.531 --> 01:27:43.050
down and abused,
you know what you mean?
It's become commodified.
Yeah.
It's like,

1529
01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.180
yeah.
It's like when people call themselves a healer,
I'm like,
all right,

1530
01:27:46.190 --> 01:27:50.990
you're really,
yeah,
I've just done some on the way they looked,
that guy.

1531
01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:55.370
We're all healing.
Um,
I mean we really are all healing each other,

1532
01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.353
but um,

1533
01:27:56.540 --> 01:28:01.400
I think there's something to doing difficult tasks that it makes life easier.

1534
01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:04.340
I really believe that.
I think it makes life more enjoyable.

1535
01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:08.820
I think it makes the bright colors brighter and it makes the,

1536
01:28:08.821 --> 01:28:12.650
the dull colors,
even them.
Even the,
the,
the bad moments.

1537
01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:16.550
If you have real positive experiences with difficult things that you choose to

1538
01:28:16.551 --> 01:28:20.990
do on your own,
I think it mitigates most of the hassle of life.
Yes,

1539
01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:22.970
I agree with that.
That is,
again,

1540
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:25.730
and I'm not particularly promoting this book because I'd like,
uh,

1541
01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:27.890
I'm all right with however things do,

1542
01:28:27.891 --> 01:28:31.760
but the point of this mentorship is the idea that someone will exhibit qualities

1543
01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:32.811
that you recognize,

1544
01:28:32.811 --> 01:28:36.650
you damn fully realized in yourself and that you can sort of model them and

1545
01:28:36.651 --> 01:28:40.460
realize them because later you have those qualities.
Like Kevin Hart,

1546
01:28:40.461 --> 01:28:43.010
we were talking about how her boy find his positivity.

1547
01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:48.940
So real believable on a practical level off he's building his standup.

1548
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:51.850
That guy's fucking diligent and the of when he talked to his,

1549
01:28:52.050 --> 01:28:56.030
when he taught for his work schedule,
you quite,
you fetishize hardworking men.

1550
01:28:56.031 --> 01:29:00.580
I think I've heard you talk about Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart that you liked

1551
01:29:00.581 --> 01:29:04.190
the idea of men.
I'm up at those people too.
I mean the Cryo Chamber.

1552
01:29:04.191 --> 01:29:06.060
I don't do that though.
I sleep in

1553
01:29:08.530 --> 01:29:12.720
a lot of things that they don't do like I,
but I also,
you know,

1554
01:29:12.721 --> 01:29:17.430
unlike the rocket lease I do standup mean Kevin does stand up to obviously I

1555
01:29:17.431 --> 01:29:21.960
don't know if he does it as much or as often as I do,
but I,
cause I do the clubs.

1556
01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:27.200
I have a philosophy about what's required to develop great standup that you have

1557
01:29:27.601 --> 01:29:32.280
to do a lot of sets,
you have to do a lot of numbers,
a lot of different places,

1558
01:29:32.281 --> 01:29:35.550
different environments and I found that out the hard way through my best

1559
01:29:35.551 --> 01:29:37.880
performances in my less good performances,

1560
01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:41.420
like what was missing and what did I gain?
You like ACA?

1561
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:44.450
I think Casey has sort of an interesting to bait a know.

1562
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:46.850
I don't know if it's him stand up world at large,
but it's sending,

1563
01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.900
saying I've thought about a lot is like that.

1564
01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:53.820
As soon as I was able to have an audience that would come and see me,
I was like,

1565
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.660
I'm out.
Thank you God.

1566
01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:00.150
I'm not putting myself through that shit again.

1567
01:30:00.210 --> 01:30:03.100
Does Dan hope feels the same way by the way.
And he's one of the best.

1568
01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:06.840
He's amazing.
He's absolutely fantastic.
I completely agree.
And like,

1569
01:30:06.841 --> 01:30:07.950
cause I thought like,

1570
01:30:07.951 --> 01:30:12.240
cause while I feel like is it the comedy club environment warps your material

1571
01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:16.340
because you've got a appeal to them and I think you ain't the fucking arbiters

1572
01:30:16.341 --> 01:30:17.174
of truth.

1573
01:30:17.190 --> 01:30:22.190
You've drunk crazy 2:00 AM motherfuckers like so I guess I perform,

1574
01:30:22.261 --> 01:30:23.560
I'll,
what I'll do is I am,

1575
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:27.720
what I'm doing to say at the moment is I'll book the UC be like Oh that places

1576
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:31.470
102 hundred or go Largo or put on events and I'm doing events one,

1577
01:30:31.471 --> 01:30:32.730
I mean la cause I think,

1578
01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:36.440
oh these people come and they love me and they bring the beads.

1579
01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:40.520
He's Vegan cookies and you got to come to the comedy store man.

1580
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:41.820
Go on after Joey Diaz.

1581
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:49.930
Cause I feel like I like a nurturing environment again in mean because I've done

1582
01:30:50.761 --> 01:30:55.140
those fucking clubs like you know even comedy store and late night comedy store

1583
01:30:55.141 --> 01:30:59.540
in La as well as London.
And I thought,
oh Jesus,
thank God.
And after.

1584
01:30:59.590 --> 01:31:02.100
So like I'm interested to you.
That's part of that.

1585
01:31:02.101 --> 01:31:06.660
What I think some people could reductively refer to his machismo in you like

1586
01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:09.570
that you go,
no,
I'm going in now.
You know what it is.

1587
01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:13.650
It's that guy that mounted you and went for the arm bar new escaped.

1588
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:17.340
It's worth it because it was hard.
You're like,

1589
01:31:17.341 --> 01:31:21.160
you realize if a child got on top of you and went for an arm bar,
new escape,

1590
01:31:21.161 --> 01:31:25.710
you'd feel nothing.
So when you were at Largo performing for children

1591
01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:29.513
child stand,

1592
01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:34.560
it's like wrestling with a hundred pound women who just started yesterday.

1593
01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:38.550
The make a wish foundation,
Russell.
Then tell us your stories.

1594
01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:44.550
Thank you.
Thank you children.
But,

1595
01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:49.570
but like the counter argument to that is therefore I'm in an environment that is

1596
01:31:49.981 --> 01:31:54.981
sympathetic and he is my audience and I'm not biasing I what?

1597
01:31:55.051 --> 01:31:57.830
You know,
the idea of it overcoming a greater obstacle.

1598
01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:00.010
I completely appreciate you're saying,
but

1599
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:04.000
<v 1>say you believe in the pure ease of stand up as being some real expression of</v>

1600
01:32:04.001 --> 01:32:06.700
yourself as in the Arrow hitting the bullseye.

1601
01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:09.610
I feel like I have a vision of what I'm trying to achieve.

1602
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:14.680
An increasingly is becoming about I want my standup,
I want to hang on.

1603
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:15.101
You know,

1604
01:32:15.101 --> 01:32:18.100
like as I've always done stories where I feel embarrassed and humiliated,

1605
01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:22.360
but I want to hang off it ruminations on what are believed to be the nature of

1606
01:32:22.361 --> 01:32:25.330
truth.
And I want people to come out of those things feeling loved,
validate,

1607
01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:28.240
excepted and that they're good enough and that they can explore themselves.

1608
01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:32.800
It's more of a one man show in a sense is that I don't want to like sacrifice

1609
01:32:32.801 --> 01:32:36.400
the laughs,
you know?
I mean I love the loss,
the loss.
Why is where we're at.

1610
01:32:36.401 --> 01:32:39.250
You know,
you don't give a sacrifice in a one man show.
I mean,

1611
01:32:39.251 --> 01:32:41.800
you can certainly do a one man show that it'd be really funny,

1612
01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:44.680
but say you start going into,
yeah,
that's one thing and I'm sort of,

1613
01:32:44.690 --> 01:32:47.520
I'm trying to build things like around 12 steps and trying to know and like

1614
01:32:47.530 --> 01:32:50.860
doing things that people have some takeaway value from now.
Like,
you know,

1615
01:32:50.890 --> 01:32:54.160
like trying to develop that after Joey Diaz in the store.

1616
01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:56.920
There's going to be some resistance.

1617
01:32:56.921 --> 01:33:00.730
You were of Hannah Gadsby and the controversy of this.

1618
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:03.240
I haven't seen it.
Yeah,

1619
01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:07.720
cause what the end of comedy and all that kind of thing.
It's silly.

1620
01:33:07.721 --> 01:33:08.740
It's no end of comedy.

1621
01:33:08.741 --> 01:33:12.230
But she what she's doing people like and there's nothing wrong,

1622
01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:16.360
call it whatever you want.
Sometimes it's funny,
I mean maybe it's standup comedy,

1623
01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:19.750
some of my mates and they told me towards the end it could become a sort of

1624
01:33:19.751 --> 01:33:23.560
quite aggressive towards yield.
It became like a Ted talk almost.
I guess.

1625
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:25.720
Apparently I'm interested or you know,
that's,
you know,
yeah,

1626
01:33:25.721 --> 01:33:29.310
there's enough room for everyone to exist to do whatever they're doing but like

1627
01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:32.080
see at the beginning of my guys call it career,

1628
01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:35.530
like I used to not prepare at all.
I was still drinking and using.

1629
01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:38.570
I got up on stage,
I trop shit up.
I'd get into confrontation.

1630
01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:42.670
When I say Trump shop,
I'd take up animals,
shit part animal parts.

1631
01:33:42.671 --> 01:33:44.680
I'd got from butchers like like a skull.

1632
01:33:44.681 --> 01:33:48.640
We've all meat and stuff and sinew on it.
Chop it up for,
I knew it was released.

1633
01:33:48.641 --> 01:33:52.420
Locusts getting to confrontation like so yeah,
exactly.

1634
01:33:52.421 --> 01:33:55.370
The reaction you're having is this action they were hacking.
That's,
that sounds,

1635
01:33:55.371 --> 01:33:57.340
that frame road I had like a fight.

1636
01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:01.100
So I've got scars on my body from bad standup gigs from a time where I've got to

1637
01:34:01.101 --> 01:34:04.930
a confrontation.
Like I was making a point about pedophilia saying,
oh,

1638
01:34:04.931 --> 01:34:06.250
we're all one cultural mind.

1639
01:34:06.251 --> 01:34:09.070
So when a particular paedophile is transgressed against a child,

1640
01:34:09.071 --> 01:34:11.560
we're all responsible.
People are like,
what the fuck?

1641
01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.510
I've got the shit kicked out.
Well that's how I,
you know,

1642
01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:18.280
I've still got the scar on my leg that happened at Edinburgh in Scotland.

1643
01:34:18.281 --> 01:34:20.710
People didn't take it well,
so,

1644
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:25.660
but what I was trying to do was like create,
I didn't have the skills,
the chops,

1645
01:34:25.661 --> 01:34:28.750
the experience than he hoax.
So is so under equipped.

1646
01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:33.400
But like what I was trying to do was create environments that felt,
yeah,

1647
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:34.930
I'm much better at doing that now.

1648
01:34:34.931 --> 01:34:39.370
I can create kind of an uncertainty in a room or kind of a sense of chaos and

1649
01:34:39.371 --> 01:34:40.690
what's happening and then bring it back.

1650
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:45.070
I hope to a humorous conclusion where people feel safe and amused and all of

1651
01:34:45.071 --> 01:34:47.740
that kind of stuff.
Now I think it's you can like,

1652
01:34:47.741 --> 01:34:50.710
cause I did try and do that and comedy clubs and yeah it was confrontation.

1653
01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:51.730
It's not what people want.

1654
01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:56.620
So don't you think that by prepping your stand up in those environments that it

1655
01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:00.680
biases you towards a type of standup comedy that is limited?

1656
01:35:01.290 --> 01:35:03.780
<v 3>No,
because you can do that other stuff too.</v>

1657
01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:07.950
You can always perform to your crowd and you could always expand on things to

1658
01:35:07.951 --> 01:35:08.641
your crowd.

1659
01:35:08.641 --> 01:35:13.641
But to really put it together without any fluff,

1660
01:35:14.130 --> 01:35:17.730
without any nonsense,
without being self indulgent,

1661
01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.810
with respecting the attention span of the audience that may or may not even be

1662
01:35:21.811 --> 01:35:23.460
there to see you most likely is not.

1663
01:35:23.461 --> 01:35:26.280
If you go to a comedy club and there's a large,
you know,

1664
01:35:26.281 --> 01:35:27.960
if you go to the comedy store any night of the week,

1665
01:35:27.961 --> 01:35:31.560
there's 15 plus people on the marquee or on the list.

1666
01:35:31.890 --> 01:35:36.150
And the show starts at 8:00 PM or 9:00 PM depending on the night and it goes to

1667
01:35:36.151 --> 01:35:37.950
two o'clock in the morning and you know,

1668
01:35:37.951 --> 01:35:42.951
you catch waves in there and there's different types of comedy and in that

1669
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:45.900
you're,
you're going to deal with sometimes tired audiences,

1670
01:35:45.901 --> 01:35:49.680
sometimes enthusiastic people.
It's all different.
It varies widely.

1671
01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:51.510
And I think that um,

1672
01:35:51.810 --> 01:35:56.040
in doing that you cut all the nonsense out of your act and you,

1673
01:35:56.041 --> 01:35:58.050
you develop an economy of words,

1674
01:35:58.230 --> 01:36:01.770
you understand how to captivate people's attention and keep them engaged and to

1675
01:36:01.771 --> 01:36:05.040
respect their time,
respect their point of view,

1676
01:36:05.041 --> 01:36:09.570
respect that these people have an attention span,
they want to be engaged in,

1677
01:36:09.571 --> 01:36:11.580
in the best possible way that you can do it.

1678
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:16.910
And sometimes you develop that through these really difficult sets or you know,

1679
01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:20.760
distracted people and drunks and all that stuff.
You can develop that,

1680
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:21.990
those qualities.

1681
01:36:22.170 --> 01:36:26.760
You're always going to have your crowd and your crowd.
I mean,
if you have this,

1682
01:36:26.761 --> 01:36:28.710
this vision of how you want to put things together,

1683
01:36:29.010 --> 01:36:31.920
you could put that kind of thing together at a comedy club.

1684
01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:33.490
You're doing it in these 15 minute chunks.

1685
01:36:33.491 --> 01:36:37.110
So you just have to figure out a way to grab them and make them really

1686
01:36:37.111 --> 01:36:38.490
interested in what you have to say.

1687
01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:38.951
<v 1>You're right.</v>

1688
01:36:38.951 --> 01:36:42.850
Because there's obviously in like the comedy store between now as you just

1689
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:46.260
described,
there's a contract,
we're here,
not Gainey at cu.

1690
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:50.680
We're here to laugh every 15 seconds and like,
you know,
comics like,
you know,

1691
01:36:50.681 --> 01:36:53.890
like Robin Williams or Chappelles,
the,
the,
you know,
the all time greats.

1692
01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:57.670
They went,
they go in and accept those conditions.
And I,
you know,

1693
01:36:57.671 --> 01:37:00.100
you've seen stuff I'm trying,
like Robin Williams,

1694
01:37:00.101 --> 01:37:03.370
he's just like walking around in the crowd in that very room and do,
it's like,

1695
01:37:03.371 --> 01:37:06.960
he's like,
he's doing the thing I'm talking about and he's doing it there.

1696
01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:10.570
You know,
that's when you think,
yeah,
if,
I suppose I do get that,

1697
01:37:10.571 --> 01:37:12.280
that your road testing it to,
uh,

1698
01:37:12.670 --> 01:37:15.070
each durability to an incredible degree if you can.

1699
01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:19.540
<v 3>Yeah.
Well think about every time you're saying something when you're,</v>

1700
01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.190
you have a subject like say if you want to,

1701
01:37:21.191 --> 01:37:24.880
do you want to talk about the mentors that you have in life?
There's,

1702
01:37:25.190 --> 01:37:26.740
it's an open ended approach.

1703
01:37:26.770 --> 01:37:30.850
You have no idea what the correct way to say something is.

1704
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:35.140
You try it,
you,
you write it out,
you say this seems feasible.

1705
01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:39.700
Let me try it this way.
And oftentimes people never correct it or they never,

1706
01:37:39.730 --> 01:37:42.190
they never adjusted,
they never go back and improve it.

1707
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:44.890
They just say it in a certain way and figure out how to do it.

1708
01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:47.620
When you're doing it in front of a crowd,

1709
01:37:47.710 --> 01:37:52.710
you're developing these things while also feeling the way people were reacting

1710
01:37:52.991 --> 01:37:55.470
to them and feeling their attention span.

1711
01:37:55.770 --> 01:38:00.770
And it makes you with proper reflection and truly objective listening to your

1712
01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:05.630
material,
it makes you change and shift and adjust things in a,

1713
01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:09.120
hopefully in a positive way get in.
And the more you do it,

1714
01:38:09.121 --> 01:38:10.260
the more you get a sense of,

1715
01:38:10.261 --> 01:38:15.261
maybe this is clunky here and maybe I figured out a better way to say it and I

1716
01:38:15.391 --> 01:38:17.040
agree.
But the counter argument could be the,

1717
01:38:17.041 --> 01:38:21.050
it could buy us you to a sort of a lowest common denominator area Saber.

1718
01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:25.430
That bit where you talk about the sun and you know it's,
you know,
you need it,

1719
01:38:25.431 --> 01:38:27.290
he's trying to kill you.
It gives you cancer.
Right.
You know,

1720
01:38:27.291 --> 01:38:32.291
like something like what was the journey of that bear standup?

1721
01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:33.600
Is this that for me it's like,

1722
01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:37.740
oh I think of before I try and make sure there's a tag so I know where I'm going

1723
01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:42.000
when I'm out there.
And then it says comparable process to yours,

1724
01:38:42.001 --> 01:38:43.980
you're trying your best to get rid of fluff or wherever.

1725
01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.400
So can you recall like why he's like,
you know,

1726
01:38:47.401 --> 01:38:50.550
are you night after night going in with new bits of material,

1727
01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:53.160
packaged within things that you were a little more confident?

1728
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:58.230
I put that bit on a special,
I can do it better now.
I know a better way to do it.

1729
01:38:58.231 --> 01:39:00.480
And that's part of the problem with doing bits.

1730
01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:04.440
So like sometimes you release them on a specialty of a better version of it now.

1731
01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:09.690
But my point of that was to a prospective enhancer to let people know that bit

1732
01:39:09.691 --> 01:39:11.880
was about like understanding what's happening here.

1733
01:39:12.150 --> 01:39:16.740
You are literally floating in infinity and it's almost never discussed.

1734
01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:20.640
You're hurling through forever.
There's a fireball on the scar.

1735
01:39:20.641 --> 01:39:24.090
It's a million times bigger than earth.
If you stare at it,
you'll go blind.

1736
01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:27.750
It's trying to give you cancer.
And if it's not there,
you get sad.
Yeah.

1737
01:39:27.751 --> 01:39:31.560
You live in a dream like this is madness.
You're life is madness.

1738
01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:34.620
And Yeah it is.
But I wanted,

1739
01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:39.360
there's something about that particular way of IX.
See,

1740
01:39:39.361 --> 01:39:44.010
cause I figured out a way to express it short in short doses,

1741
01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:47.910
in short bursts,
if you know,
if you stare at it and go blind,

1742
01:39:48.170 --> 01:39:50.340
it's trying to give you cancer and if it's not there you get sad.

1743
01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:53.720
So in that short bursts,
it's,
you know,
like wow.
Yeah.
That is all,

1744
01:39:53.721 --> 01:39:55.650
all those things are true.
Like this is crazy.

1745
01:39:55.770 --> 01:39:59.310
There really is a fireball floating in the sky and we're just used to it.

1746
01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:03.300
We live because of a floating million times bigger than the earth.

1747
01:40:03.301 --> 01:40:04.320
Fireball and I,

1748
01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:08.700
when you say if you could say something like that and make someone laugh,

1749
01:40:08.970 --> 01:40:12.660
you can actually change the way they look at things.

1750
01:40:12.690 --> 01:40:15.330
You can actually affect at least the way they look at things.

1751
01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:20.070
If we just say something,
sometimes it's profound,
sometimes it registers,

1752
01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:23.190
but if you could say something and it forces someone to laugh,

1753
01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:26.130
even if they disagree with you,
if they're laughing like,

1754
01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.530
I don't even fucking agree with this,
but holy shit,
this is funny.

1755
01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:33.800
You put that thought deep into someone's head and you allow them to think about

1756
01:40:34.741 --> 01:40:39.630
your thought process and and how your creative process and what you're doing to

1757
01:40:39.631 --> 01:40:42.210
sort of bring these things out.
Yes.

1758
01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:45.270
I like the way you just described the architecture of that.

1759
01:40:45.271 --> 01:40:46.650
You've got basically have,

1760
01:40:46.710 --> 01:40:51.710
these are some facts about the sun irrefutable now he is how that affects the

1761
01:40:52.051 --> 01:40:54.180
way we look at world and exposes

1762
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:57.730
<v 1>to us that we are just ignorant.
We're not awake to reality.</v>

1763
01:40:57.940 --> 01:41:02.440
We can't hold reality in our minds because it's too vast to handle.

1764
01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.830
I am like,

1765
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:07.780
and I agree with you that let you know what the way of laughter comes access to

1766
01:41:07.781 --> 01:41:12.140
kind of deeper truths and I've heard some therapist in fact say that like the

1767
01:41:12.690 --> 01:41:16.000
laughter is to shame what grief is to sadness.

1768
01:41:16.001 --> 01:41:20.190
That laughter is helping to expel shame and to process Shane.

1769
01:41:20.191 --> 01:41:23.590
That is something very important about people coming together and laughing

1770
01:41:23.591 --> 01:41:24.424
together.

1771
01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:28.930
I like to exist comedically in a world where it's like stars from a deeply

1772
01:41:28.931 --> 01:41:31.930
personal perspective and admissions and acknowledgements of humiliation and

1773
01:41:31.931 --> 01:41:36.931
shame and vulnerability and travels out to the universal and hopefully archetype

1774
01:41:36.941 --> 01:41:39.940
all that you can sort of travel between those points with a comedian.

1775
01:41:39.941 --> 01:41:42.070
That thing we both admire Bill Hicks.

1776
01:41:42.071 --> 01:41:43.620
Well I think is fascinating is because like,

1777
01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:48.220
you know like if you've loved Bill Hicks for a long wild and you discover man

1778
01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:50.800
guy works material a lot,

1779
01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:53.830
you know like Oh I watched this interview of him on the Australian TV.

1780
01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:56.550
He's doing like a bit that I've seen him do,
you know,

1781
01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:00.970
in multiple incarnations.
But I have also seen him do interviews,

1782
01:42:00.971 --> 01:42:03.220
ways spontaneously talking about gigs.

1783
01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:05.380
Terrible gigs have gone badly and he is hilarious.

1784
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:06.700
But it's pretty interesting to me.

1785
01:42:06.701 --> 01:42:10.420
And perhaps it's because of that background and that practice of doing clubs

1786
01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:14.440
that Hicks is very much a comedian that's,
no,

1787
01:42:14.441 --> 01:42:16.730
I'm drilling this fucking thing and I'm staying with,

1788
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:20.070
<v 3>no,
he was a writer.
I mean he,
he did ad Lib and he did,</v>

1789
01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:24.570
he was capable of going on these rants,
spontaneous rants.
But he was a writer,

1790
01:42:24.810 --> 01:42:28.710
you know,
he wrote these things out and he was aiming to have an impact with his

1791
01:42:28.711 --> 01:42:32.040
commentary.
I mean that was what was he was doing.

1792
01:42:32.041 --> 01:42:35.710
It was not just trying to make you laugh,
he was aiming to enhance your,

1793
01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:38.430
your perspective on whatever he was talking about.

1794
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:42.210
<v 1>Yeah.
And as it receives,
very disciplined as a practitioner of it.</v>

1795
01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:46.740
Whereas like say a Chappelle,
if it was like he's just got like an hour,

1796
01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:50.110
<v 3>well,
you know,
he's got a very unique process.
Chip Chappelle does.</v>

1797
01:42:50.410 --> 01:42:53.680
And he can turn over an hour like no one I've ever seen before.

1798
01:42:53.681 --> 01:42:57.100
And I was talking to Darnell wrongs about it recently who was on the Chappelle

1799
01:42:57.101 --> 01:42:57.970
show with them and he's like,

1800
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.750
we both agreed like he's the best ever at turning over a new hour.

1801
01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:02.920
He could have a new one,

1802
01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:07.390
he could release a Netflix special and then have a new hour within a couple of

1803
01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:10.780
weeks.
It doesn't even make sense.
I don't,
I don't understand how he's doing it.

1804
01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:15.310
It must just flat it's,
and he's just,
he's in a great space,
you know,

1805
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:18.340
and he's in a great mindset to do comedy.
You know,

1806
01:43:18.341 --> 01:43:22.570
if you pay attention to how,
you know,
when,
when people study,

1807
01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:26.770
like if you read outliers and you read how people,

1808
01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:28.090
when people study,

1809
01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:31.960
why people are great at what they do and what makes an exceptional.

1810
01:43:32.110 --> 01:43:36.550
There's always a variety of factors and whatever the factors are with Dave,

1811
01:43:36.850 --> 01:43:39.520
he's got this easygoing personality,

1812
01:43:39.521 --> 01:43:43.270
this like very carefully carefree way of looking at things.

1813
01:43:43.630 --> 01:43:47.890
He's also gone through a lot of bullshit and his career with the leaving the

1814
01:43:47.891 --> 01:43:49.930
Chappelle show and you know,

1815
01:43:50.230 --> 01:43:55.230
abandoning million dollars and going to Africa and really understanding what is

1816
01:43:55.461 --> 01:43:58.850
real motivation where he was caught up in that world where they were trying to

1817
01:43:58.851 --> 01:44:01.460
change him and commercialize his television show.

1818
01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:05.510
And he handled it as good as anybody that's ever handled it.

1819
01:44:06.110 --> 01:44:10.700
He handled fame and temptation I think better than anyone I've ever heard of.

1820
01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:13.820
He just said,
fuck you.
And he just went away.

1821
01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:17.030
He went away and then didn't do gigs for years.

1822
01:44:17.031 --> 01:44:20.540
People in understand he would show up and do standup places,

1823
01:44:20.541 --> 01:44:25.370
but he wouldn't book anything.
So like he wasn't getting paid,
he was just,

1824
01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:29.630
he did stand up.
Dave Chappelle did stand up in the park in Seattle.

1825
01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:34.070
He brought like a little amplifier and a microphone set up and just started

1826
01:44:34.071 --> 01:44:38.480
doing standup and people just gathered round and he did this just to sort of get

1827
01:44:38.481 --> 01:44:40.130
him back in touch with his roots.

1828
01:44:40.131 --> 01:44:43.670
Cause he used to do a lot of street performing in New York and I saw him do a

1829
01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:45.020
street performing in Montreal.

1830
01:44:45.021 --> 01:44:48.170
We did a club and then we came out of the club and Dave,

1831
01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:51.590
I think Dave was like 18 or 19 is a time just started doing standup on the

1832
01:44:51.591 --> 01:44:55.420
street and put his hat out and people would put money in his hat.
I mean,

1833
01:44:55.430 --> 01:45:00.430
he was a constantly sharpening that sword and he stopped doing standup for a

1834
01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:06.440
long time in terms of like booking gigs.
And then after awhile I said,
fuck it,

1835
01:45:06.441 --> 01:45:09.800
I'm going to come back again.
And then he started doing these gigantic gigs.

1836
01:45:09.801 --> 01:45:12.080
And then of course he did his two recent,
uh,

1837
01:45:12.081 --> 01:45:16.190
Netflix specials where amongst his best work ever.
And you know,
and now he's,

1838
01:45:16.191 --> 01:45:17.480
he's working all the time.

1839
01:45:17.481 --> 01:45:21.140
He's constantly popping into the comedy store and the comedy cellar and all

1840
01:45:21.141 --> 01:45:25.550
these different clubs all across the country and constantly doing standup and no

1841
01:45:25.551 --> 01:45:28.940
social media.
He does not,
not involved in any of that stuff.

1842
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.750
It doesn't do anything just to just perform,
just does this stuff.
Yeah.

1843
01:45:32.751 --> 01:45:35.300
That's interesting.
When you,
it's like I,

1844
01:45:36.170 --> 01:45:41.170
I feel that some people found the essence and found their path and live it and

1845
01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:46.040
like they,
like they're a Yogi or a priest or something.

1846
01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:49.400
He's just got a devotional,
this is who I am.
I'm not doing anything.

1847
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:50.980
It's not that and it,
yeah.

1848
01:45:50.981 --> 01:45:55.050
And that's exhibited even in earliest stuff prior to the cry of it.

1849
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:56.000
You know what you would just,
you know,

1850
01:45:56.001 --> 01:46:00.690
the crisis if the 50 million walk away thing like by then if he was at I am

1851
01:46:00.691 --> 01:46:03.280
doing in clubs,
he was heartened.
He's lucky.

1852
01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:07.070
What that what seems so loose on the stage with something that had been refined

1853
01:46:07.071 --> 01:46:10.250
as opposed and he's comfortable and he was always good.

1854
01:46:10.251 --> 01:46:14.330
He was good when I first met him when he was like 18 I think he was 18 and I was

1855
01:46:14.331 --> 01:46:17.390
21 so it was somewhere in that range.
Maybe I was a little older.

1856
01:46:17.391 --> 01:46:19.730
Maybe he a maybe it was like how old Dave?

1857
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:24.320
46 47 I think he's five years younger than me.

1858
01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:28.880
Is that correct?
46 or 47 45 okay.

1859
01:46:28.881 --> 01:46:32.690
So He's more so six years,
six years younger than me.
So you know,

1860
01:46:33.230 --> 01:46:37.610
I was probably 25 and he was probably 18 ish,

1861
01:46:37.850 --> 01:46:41.270
25,
26,
1817.
But he was,
um,

1862
01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:47.080
he was so like calm and like he was very,

1863
01:46:47.630 --> 01:46:51.030
like,
it was,
you were attracted to listening to him.
It was like,
like,

1864
01:46:51.031 --> 01:46:51.864
look at this guy,

1865
01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:57.080
like this guy's like so comfortable in his own skin and so friendly and easy

1866
01:46:57.311 --> 01:46:59.040
going and hilarious.

1867
01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:04.340
But who he was then and then who he became is all the work that he put in.

1868
01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:08.310
You know,
it's like he had this base of this really,
you know,

1869
01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.950
this curious young,

1870
01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:15.180
very wise person who saw things that other people didn't see in the world.

1871
01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:17.940
And then he just kept going and just kept going.

1872
01:47:17.941 --> 01:47:21.630
And then of course the Chappelle show,
which is in my opinion,

1873
01:47:21.631 --> 01:47:25.200
the greatest sketch comedy show of all time,
even though it was only two seasons,

1874
01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:28.500
it's the best ever.
And then after that,

1875
01:47:28.590 --> 01:47:32.640
I mean he's basically just on standup and done it completely outside of the

1876
01:47:32.641 --> 01:47:36.450
system.
He's done some parts in movies and shit like that.
But for the most part,

1877
01:47:36.451 --> 01:47:39.870
what he's doing is just stand up completely outside of the Hollywood system.

1878
01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:43.980
Completely free.
Just goes up,
you know,
just to talk some shit.

1879
01:47:43.981 --> 01:47:48.660
How's a couple of drinks,
laughs and,
and,
and,
and it's incredibly compelling.

1880
01:47:48.690 --> 01:47:50.520
He's found his groove,
you know,
and that's,

1881
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:55.200
it's a beautiful thing to watch as a fellow standup comedy practitioner when

1882
01:47:55.201 --> 01:47:57.660
someone,
he would treat Cheves this mastery level.

1883
01:47:57.661 --> 01:48:01.080
Like we know we were talking about like this Hicks and Gracie of standup comedy

1884
01:48:01.081 --> 01:48:03.810
level because that's where he's at right now.
I agree with you.

1885
01:48:03.811 --> 01:48:06.000
Become who you are.
Yeah,
he's,
yeah.

1886
01:48:06.001 --> 01:48:08.970
He's become himself and he doesn't have things that are getting in the way of

1887
01:48:08.971 --> 01:48:13.020
that.
Yeah.
That's what's really interesting.
Like you don't see him,
he's like,

1888
01:48:13.021 --> 01:48:15.210
he's not on social media.
He's not on anything.

1889
01:48:15.211 --> 01:48:17.730
Twitter or Facebook is not any of that shit.

1890
01:48:17.970 --> 01:48:21.690
He doesn't pay attention to any of it.
He's just just being a person,

1891
01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:26.340
just being a person and doing stand up,
you know,
it's a,
and he doesn't have to,

1892
01:48:26.341 --> 01:48:30.420
which is unique to,
you know,
he doesn't have to promote things.
They just sell out

1893
01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:34.390
<v 1>the adequate.
An amazing example or an amazing example.</v>

1894
01:48:34.990 --> 01:48:38.470
I've got promote some things.
Oh what do you got?
Book mentors.

1895
01:48:41.650 --> 01:48:45.340
I really learned some powerful lessons there from the story of a,

1896
01:48:45.341 --> 01:48:47.890
the apotheosis of comedy that Dave Chappelle's achieved.

1897
01:48:47.891 --> 01:48:52.030
Here's these obligations.
Now I'm,
I'm booked here to promote luminary.

1898
01:48:52.031 --> 01:48:56.890
My podcast had gone behind a paywall on a platform called luminary.

1899
01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:00.750
I'm in a be the Netflix of podcast,
meaning like that,

1900
01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:03.520
you know your model will I imagine triumph fervor.

1901
01:49:03.790 --> 01:49:08.530
So like from like this week my podcast will be on luminary as part of their

1902
01:49:08.531 --> 01:49:12.520
premium content is an APP through which you'll get all podcast.
But my podcast,

1903
01:49:12.521 --> 01:49:15.130
it's like you've got to say that the launch now that's lunch cause they tell him

1904
01:49:15.131 --> 01:49:15.860
the dice.

1905
01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:18.680
<v 3>Yeah,
I know that was in the process of being created.</v>

1906
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:22.340
<v 1>Happy with that so far is because he's not launched.
I don't know.
But I,
you know,</v>

1907
01:49:22.341 --> 01:49:25.490
you know it like that you're going to leave listeners behind because it's gone

1908
01:49:25.491 --> 01:49:29.000
behind a pay wall.
But I spoke to sort of less Sam Harris about a lightweight he,

1909
01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:33.530
Sam Harris actually you'd give him,
told me about it.
Yeah.
Right,
right.

1910
01:49:33.531 --> 01:49:34.700
And I spoke to like,

1911
01:49:34.701 --> 01:49:39.380
and what I recognized is because like the advertising model works here obviously

1912
01:49:39.381 --> 01:49:43.910
in your case.
And I thought,
wow,
like there it was like a good deal.

1913
01:49:43.950 --> 01:49:47.860
It was a good deal or meant or I can carry on doing podcasts for two for years.

1914
01:49:47.861 --> 01:49:48.070
That's

1915
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.161
<v 0>what,</v>

1916
01:49:48.161 --> 01:49:53.161
you know what this is and it's support in a lot of other content and essentially

1917
01:49:53.621 --> 01:49:57.460
not yielding any creative control of people.
Just if people subscribe,

1918
01:49:57.461 --> 01:50:01.220
they get the premium content.
My staff,
how much it was like 105 bucks a month.

1919
01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:05.260
Right.
That Trevor Noah,
Lena Dunham,
mine.

1920
01:50:05.590 --> 01:50:07.080
How many different podcasts?
I don't know.

1921
01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:11.850
I think that when their premium content is like 40 or 50 premium pot,
good luck,

1922
01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:15.750
you know,
pieces of content.
Like I said,
for me I thought like,
you know,

1923
01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:20.740
it felt like otherwise podcast wouldn't be something that I could continue to do

1924
01:50:20.741 --> 01:50:22.160
forever,
every second.
You know,

1925
01:50:22.630 --> 01:50:26.770
cause I do films or TV shows or stand up or whatever,

1926
01:50:27.090 --> 01:50:28.480
or like a difficult like,
you know,

1927
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:32.320
for me it wasn't a viable thing to pay for,

1928
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:34.390
to pay for people to run it,

1929
01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:38.830
to pay for guests to be get to me and all of that kind of stuff.
You know?
No,

1930
01:50:38.850 --> 01:50:43.770
no to do,
do ads on your podcasts I did before,
but after it isn't,

1931
01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:48.430
it's an ad free model.
There's a benefit to that for sure.
You know,

1932
01:50:48.431 --> 01:50:52.090
and a lot of people choose to go ad free and then they use patriarchy or

1933
01:50:52.091 --> 01:50:54.730
something like that for her support stuff.

1934
01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:56.950
Sam Harris was doing that for a long time,
but then he,

1935
01:50:57.460 --> 01:51:01.510
they had an issue with patron about certain censorship of certain individuals

1936
01:51:01.511 --> 01:51:05.800
and certain ideological perspectives where they were leaning towards left wing

1937
01:51:05.801 --> 01:51:07.990
things and being,

1938
01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:12.320
being restrictive towards right wing things.
And then,
you know,

1939
01:51:12.490 --> 01:51:16.510
the policing,
the way people behave outside of,

1940
01:51:16.810 --> 01:51:18.730
and some people found that objectionable,

1941
01:51:18.731 --> 01:51:23.260
so he left and some other people left.
Like Jordan Peterson left.

1942
01:51:23.261 --> 01:51:27.640
And I've never entered into patriotic into those waters.
But uh,

1943
01:51:27.641 --> 01:51:28.540
I know bird does it.

1944
01:51:28.541 --> 01:51:32.910
I think Burt has like one a week that he does it doesn't help were really,
yeah,

1945
01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:38.020
he's done is,
he's one of the best.
It's so like,
uh,
like I feel like,
uh,
yeah,

1946
01:51:38.021 --> 01:51:41.050
I feel like it's an all right thing to do.
But even in,
um,

1947
01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:45.220
like just with using things like youtube and social media and you know,

1948
01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:48.670
like Spotify or iTunes or whatever,
like,
you know,
as we've seen,

1949
01:51:48.671 --> 01:51:52.720
there's a point where there is sort of censorship is a possibility.

1950
01:51:52.930 --> 01:51:56.380
Like as you discussed on the Jack,
like at that run of episodes may,

1951
01:51:56.530 --> 01:52:00.100
as I said to you by text between the Jack Dorsey,
the reaction to that,

1952
01:52:00.101 --> 01:52:03.760
your response to the reaction through Alex Jones and all that tempo.

1953
01:52:03.850 --> 01:52:06.160
I thought that was a spate of podcasts.

1954
01:52:06.161 --> 01:52:10.960
It's like this is where this medium can be.
The Alex Jones podcast.

1955
01:52:10.961 --> 01:52:14.900
I thought it was the godfather of podcasts,
seen the car.

1956
01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:18.430
It was put it out tomorrow.
He just gave it to me.

1957
01:52:18.431 --> 01:52:21.540
So I put her on what to watch now.
Watch her now.
Yeah.

1958
01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:25.810
We have a guy who's hilarious name,
his name is Pauly tune and Paulie tune.

1959
01:52:25.811 --> 01:52:30.570
Makes a animated clips for us.
We can broadcast and he's fantastic.

1960
01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:34.600
He did one of the Alex Jones.
Eddie Bravo incident.

1961
01:52:36.690 --> 01:52:38.050
Yeah.
Well they were there.
No,

1962
01:52:38.051 --> 01:52:42.220
not what he's asking him to choke him here I went the flat earth.
No,
this one.

1963
01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:45.980
It's so ridiculous.
Here.
We'll play it

1964
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:50.780
<v 4>for you.
Oh,
I want to hear it.
What's going on?
What's the matter?
Audio cut off.</v>

1965
01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:55.070
Okay.
Back it up for the beginning and then it was an exception.

1966
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:55.940
<v 5>David,
it looks like,</v>

1967
01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:58.113
<v 4>here we go.</v>

1968
01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:01.240
<v 5>The guy does awesome artwork.
Do.</v>

1969
01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:04.690
We're going to get you to this next and I I respect you.
Yeah.

1970
01:53:04.710 --> 01:53:06.990
Once you guys to yell at each other for three minutes while I go pee.

1971
01:53:07.110 --> 01:53:11.850
I gotta pee too.
Okay.
We'll do it and shit.
Shit,
I go first.
Okay.

1972
01:53:12.210 --> 01:53:12.750
Anyways,

1973
01:53:12.750 --> 01:53:17.750
you are someone that I could talk to about the flat earth conspiracy.

1974
01:53:18.570 --> 01:53:19.710
You don't believe in flat earth,

1975
01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:22.650
but you can kind of understand where I'm coming from.

1976
01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:26.310
If I finance a research ship and make a documentary,

1977
01:53:26.311 --> 01:53:29.970
I can't go away for three months.
I will pay one of them.
Which one can you raise?

1978
01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:34.590
We're going to need a,
are you guys going to the moon or orbit?
Okay.

1979
01:53:34.591 --> 01:53:39.360
You raised the money for a trip.
How raised the money?
Okay,

1980
01:53:41.630 --> 01:53:46.520
here's the deal.
Let's Go pee.
Go pee man.
So I'm going to,

1981
01:53:46.710 --> 01:53:49.940
we're going to do this Joe Rogan.
Yeah.
No,
no.
We're going to do this job.

1982
01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:54.170
You're going to find the edge of the world caps.
Caps.

1983
01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:59.100
They're knocking things off.
Film the drop off of my iPhone.
Yes.
Yes.
Go pee man.

1984
01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:02.400
Hopi.
Don't you have to go?
We're going to send someone else.
Alex

1985
01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:08.940
[inaudible].
I don't want to be the one to go see in a minute.

1986
01:54:10.370 --> 01:54:11.400
Come on high from right now.

1987
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:14.820
I came in here and I proved they're keeping babies alive.

1988
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:18.630
How does it prove that Jamie pulled some shit?

1989
01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:23.400
No,
the fuck the governor

1990
01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:30.300
really dig people out there campaigning for late term abortions.

1991
01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:31.620
You think that Shit's real?

1992
01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:39.530
Who would campaign for that day?

1993
01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:50.280
So you're telling me it isn't real when I had a fucking Goddamn fucking

1994
01:54:51.490 --> 01:54:52.580
conspiracy theory,

1995
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:59.750
you're fucking top of your about to get it
already born.
Babies stop.

1996
01:54:59.751 --> 01:55:03.670
Fucking lying.
Don't get best.
No.

1997
01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:06.550
You saw the dude is fucking

1998
01:55:12.910 --> 01:55:16.790
shut.
It voted their fucking bars.
Hey,

1999
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:22.670
the course.
I believe that we went into a long conversation about her.
We played,

2000
01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:26.620
I heard it.
Okay.
You heard it.
I heard the whole podcast talking with it.
Okay.

2001
01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:30.800
I don't want to hurt you in mind.
Psychosis is so crazy.

2002
01:55:30.801 --> 01:55:33.650
That always thought I was so tough.
He doesn't have to pay anymore.

2003
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:38.740
There's a little bit,
the point is,
the point is,
is this,

2004
01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:41.810
why are we debating whether the earth is flat?
Dude,
they're keeping,

2005
01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:43.930
they have human animal hybrids.

2006
01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:48.570
<v 0>Yeah,
that's good stuff.
That's what I mean.</v>

2007
01:55:48.571 --> 01:55:52.050
I feel like that is the pinnacle of where this medium can take us.

2008
01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:55.860
Watching light cannot say he was in an extreme state.

2009
01:55:56.010 --> 01:55:58.880
What about when he kicked out by be comfortable,

2010
01:55:58.890 --> 01:56:03.890
keep the belly become priests are listened to that podcast like I go on runs.

2011
01:56:05.811 --> 01:56:08.610
I had listened to this and if all fucking hell man,

2012
01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:10.470
where else are you going to get this content?

2013
01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:14.280
Whereas that agree to it anywhere else.

2014
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:18.000
That's the thing that you'd never get a group of people whose jobs depended upon

2015
01:56:18.001 --> 01:56:21.270
keeping the show on the air,
whether they're producers or executives.

2016
01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.770
They would never agree to that.
They'd be like,

2017
01:56:22.771 --> 01:56:25.020
you can't have that crazy fucker on.
You can't have this on,

2018
01:56:25.170 --> 01:56:28.320
can have any bravo on all the time.
You think stump world is flat.

2019
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:33.470
Stop this cause you traveling between such a diverse and unusual ideas and,

2020
01:56:35.071 --> 01:56:38.420
and sort of the thing we've Alex Jones is as well is that he's like,

2021
01:56:38.490 --> 01:56:42.660
he demonstrates to a point that there's veracity in what he's saying.

2022
01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:45.750
Some things.
Yeah,
he's right about a lot of things.
You know,

2023
01:56:45.751 --> 01:56:47.660
we were just talking about animals,
human hybrids.

2024
01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:51.270
We started pulling up these studies where they actually have done studies where

2025
01:56:51.271 --> 01:56:55.110
they've tried to create animal human hybrids,
non-viable,

2026
01:56:55.111 --> 01:57:00.111
an animal human embryos to trying to grow human organs in different animals.

2027
01:57:00.661 --> 01:57:03.810
And there's all sorts of weird scientific shit though.
We're doing,

2028
01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:06.840
imagine what they're doing in China behind walls.
Look at this.

2029
01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:11.040
China's latest cloned monkey experiment is an ethical mets.

2030
01:57:11.310 --> 01:57:14.520
They used CRISPR to add human genes into monkey genes and there's like five

2031
01:57:14.521 --> 01:57:17.130
monkeys.
This happened back in January and I don't do it now.

2032
01:57:17.131 --> 01:57:20.100
This is a fucking horror movie.
This is a hard way.

2033
01:57:20.101 --> 01:57:23.000
This is how the horror movie begins because you think that once,

2034
01:57:23.050 --> 01:57:27.690
if that's what's being revealed,
the truth is Darker Das for sure,

2035
01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:29.970
for sure.
They're trying to create super soldiers.

2036
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:34.920
Someone is trying to create some super soldier,
some half champ,

2037
01:57:34.921 --> 01:57:39.921
half human superintelligent murderous thing that's powered by remote control

2038
01:57:40.770 --> 01:57:42.480
pads and not a good objective.

2039
01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:47.290
No time to see a good outcome for this superintelligent murderous remote
control.

2040
01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:51.590
The only being what if you could send those superintelligent murderers,

2041
01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:56.250
chimps to go kill Isis now.
Now we've got a reason to not get them out there.

2042
01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:57.600
Now we look,

2043
01:57:57.601 --> 01:58:02.190
we've got a nice contract with the this defense contractor and they're going to,

2044
01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:06.840
that's how we lubricate the passage to the murderous monkeys is isis.

2045
01:58:06.841 --> 01:58:11.841
That's the function of Isis in the cultural conversation is to justify it.

2046
01:58:12.090 --> 01:58:13.290
The monkey cell,
which is,

2047
01:58:13.291 --> 01:58:16.340
you know what one scared me more than anyone that I've ever read.
Uh,

2048
01:58:16.341 --> 01:58:19.890
read about this thing that I'm Darpa was putting together.

2049
01:58:20.010 --> 01:58:24.480
So a robot called the eater robot,
ea t our robot.

2050
01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:28.680
It's a robot that fuels itself on a biological matter.

2051
01:58:29.190 --> 01:58:31.020
So it essentially could eat bodies.

2052
01:58:31.530 --> 01:58:34.350
So you've got a murderous robot that eats people

2053
01:58:36.130 --> 01:58:40.980
like this fuel was kind of things that human beings could,

2054
01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:46.440
it's like people are sat around trying to come up with them.
Well,
they're the,

2055
01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:47.440
you know,
they,

2056
01:58:47.470 --> 01:58:51.070
they're responsible for a lot of really crazy innovation at times of like

2057
01:58:51.071 --> 01:58:54.400
military stuff,
you know,
but Boston dynamics,
you know,

2058
01:58:54.401 --> 01:58:57.850
they're the ones who make those crazy robots and they work with Darpa,

2059
01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:01.540
and those are the ones who make those robots that you can't kick over.
Right.

2060
01:59:01.541 --> 01:59:02.040
You know,
I mean,

2061
01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:04.930
that's what you need one of those that eats people and you send them to the

2062
01:59:04.931 --> 01:59:06.880
battlefield kicking out of,
uh,
no,

2063
01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:09.730
that was the first thing we established is you can't kick it over.

2064
01:59:10.330 --> 01:59:11.380
I just think that's,

2065
01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:16.120
that's the big fear is that future warfare will be our robots versus their

2066
01:59:16.121 --> 01:59:16.954
robots.

2067
01:59:17.770 --> 01:59:22.770
If we're starting to bring about the worst aspects of the worst things that a

2068
01:59:22.991 --> 01:59:27.260
human being can conceive of that channel them through into reality.

2069
01:59:27.261 --> 01:59:29.610
It ea does make you fear that the apocalypse is real.

2070
01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:33.970
I thought it was bad enough when in the Malays of my younger days,

2071
01:59:34.210 --> 01:59:36.550
I see like a four hour.
Wow.

2072
01:59:36.551 --> 01:59:40.480
Imagine if there was a cleaning service where the person will come around and

2073
01:59:40.481 --> 01:59:43.180
clean,
dressed scantily.
They do that.

2074
01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:46.510
They do that wherever devious shit you can dream up.

2075
01:59:46.511 --> 01:59:50.650
Someone's trying to turn it back off it and they've taken it to the extent of

2076
01:59:50.651 --> 01:59:54.430
the non kick over the robot.
Fleshy in robots.

2077
01:59:56.230 --> 02:00:00.580
There's a new one new video today.
Watch this.
This is so scary.

2078
02:00:01.150 --> 02:00:02.300
This is Boston dynamics.
Yeah.

2079
02:00:03.010 --> 02:00:05.980
There's something very eerie about that type of motion.

2080
02:00:06.010 --> 02:00:09.610
You know that the way that the movement of a snake is deeply coded to be

2081
02:00:09.611 --> 02:00:12.250
unpleasant.
When you see it the same about you think that movement,

2082
02:00:12.251 --> 02:00:16.630
you think that ain't good.
The truck,
it's telling,
wow.
Oh my God,

2083
02:00:16.631 --> 02:00:19.210
they're pulling a truck when he's tiny little Tutsis,

2084
02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:22.120
those that they're that strong pull a truck.
Fenn little robot,

2085
02:00:22.150 --> 02:00:26.160
that's a giant ass truck.
I mean,
he's also just a Husky sled made,

2086
02:00:26.161 --> 02:00:28.330
have expensive robots and the truck,

2087
02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:33.400
I've spent a lot of time and endeavor to go backwards,
I guess kind of,

2088
02:00:33.401 --> 02:00:35.280
but to an angel sent to close.

2089
02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:38.380
They're showing how strong these things are and I'm like,

2090
02:00:38.410 --> 02:00:43.380
I don't like their gate,
Joe.
That's an unpleasant gate.
Yeah,
you should be on.

2091
02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:47.560
You should be uncomfortable with it.
Yeah,
that's not,
I'm not at ease with that

2092
02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:54.250
animal and there's no compassion in it.
This is,
it's,
it's feeling lists,

2093
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:55.860
but that's what you got to worry about.

2094
02:00:55.861 --> 02:00:58.870
If you've ever seen that episode of black mirror or the lady gets chased down by

2095
02:00:58.871 --> 02:01:02.920
the drones,
I have not seen that.
Well,
I've had one way their bees,
no,

2096
02:01:02.921 --> 02:01:04.870
there's a woman who's being haunted.

2097
02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:09.900
She's being hunted by a robot and it's terrifying because if it's remorseless

2098
02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:13.750
lack of humanity and empathy,
it looks just like those things.

2099
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:16.500
Those are real [inaudible] can't.

2100
02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:19.880
And that man's go could imagine that he's amazing.
He's amazing.
That show.

2101
02:01:19.881 --> 02:01:22.230
It was fantastic.
But these things,
look,

2102
02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:26.230
what we have to worry about is once artificial intelligence become sentient and

2103
02:01:26.231 --> 02:01:30.790
you can somehow or another attach it to these objects that move and they they

2104
02:01:30.791 --> 02:01:33.370
run on solar power or they have you know,

2105
02:01:33.371 --> 02:01:37.330
nuclear fuel cells or some crazy shit that allows them to exist for a long

2106
02:01:37.331 --> 02:01:40.070
period of time.
Maybe you don't have to worry about

2107
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:41.720
<v 1>them contaminating environments.</v>

2108
02:01:41.721 --> 02:01:45.740
If you plan of killing everybody in the environment and also there's no means of

2109
02:01:45.741 --> 02:01:47.180
regulation is there because this,

2110
02:01:47.181 --> 02:01:51.420
because this is the apex of human endever there in what,

2111
02:01:51.421 --> 02:01:54.860
what can govern that?
What can regulate it and like you say,

2112
02:01:54.861 --> 02:01:58.610
there'll be a Chinese equivalent for any of this stuff.

2113
02:01:58.611 --> 02:02:01.700
There's nothing that's above it.
Guy.
Now is this a good idea?
Should we pull back?

2114
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:05.640
What did he eat?
Did he just pulled up a things and so they're making that now

2115
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:10.040
they're getting a hundred different models of it are going to be available

2116
02:02:10.041 --> 02:02:13.440
starting production in the summer.
It doesn't say how much they're going to wow,

2117
02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:16.280
but available for people to buy.
Well,

2118
02:02:16.281 --> 02:02:18.950
it says a hundred different models has produce a hundred models.

2119
02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:21.200
That probably means it'll produce a hundred of them,

2120
02:02:22.250 --> 02:02:24.170
like a hundred different companies are going to want them.

2121
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:27.410
But I bet it's more than that,
if any,
about how much they cost.

2122
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:29.600
It doesn't say how much it's gonna cost.
They're gonna announce that later.

2123
02:02:29.601 --> 02:02:33.860
But there's showed uh oh like a robot arm come.
Although it looks so crampy.

2124
02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:36.860
Look at that thing.
Imagine we had one of those things in the room filming.

2125
02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:40.370
We should get one.
No,
no,
don't take it over.
One day we come here,

2126
02:02:40.371 --> 02:02:43.580
he's got red eyes and it's like,
fuck you.
Fuck you.
What?
What did it feel like?

2127
02:02:44.150 --> 02:02:45.370
We're the first ones to help it.

2128
02:02:45.810 --> 02:02:49.220
The trust be friendly and they listening to us like Alexa.

2129
02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:53.990
That's how it begins,
isn't it?
There's something arachnoid an area about that.

2130
02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:55.850
It's almost like,
you know,
natural the church.

2131
02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:59.960
See if this tunes into the DMT component of what we've been talking about.

2132
02:03:00.170 --> 02:03:03.200
It's almost as if we've already experienced to this reality.

2133
02:03:03.201 --> 02:03:07.220
We've already been through the version where those evil insectoid robots

2134
02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:09.950
takeover.
So when we see on the screen,
oh no,

2135
02:03:09.951 --> 02:03:14.480
we're doing that thing with doing that thing where we create those things that

2136
02:03:14.481 --> 02:03:19.481
bring about destruction and I believe it's because we've become biased to

2137
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:23.000
commerce and a particular type of progress.

2138
02:03:23.210 --> 02:03:28.040
But one narrative has succeeded because we necessarily have to throw off

2139
02:03:28.041 --> 02:03:30.920
religion but you know at the dawn of the secular age,

2140
02:03:30.921 --> 02:03:35.840
because religion was becoming systems of bias and systems of oppression and what

2141
02:03:35.841 --> 02:03:38.450
and systems of a but what do I want to say?

2142
02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:42.260
Elevate in certain types of power won't supporting it at least lets go hang on a

2143
02:03:42.260 --> 02:03:44.150
minute.
This religion and a lot of it seems like bullshit.

2144
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:48.530
What we've done is we've abandoned the sacred and I think if you abandon the

2145
02:03:48.531 --> 02:03:51.710
sacred meaning there is more to life than what we can understand.

2146
02:03:51.711 --> 02:03:54.380
I listened to the Brian Cox episode and I've spoke to Brian Cox,

2147
02:03:54.381 --> 02:03:58.730
the British physicist,
astrophysicist on my show as well.
And when he talks about,

2148
02:03:58.731 --> 02:03:59.630
like you said,
that you know,

2149
02:03:59.631 --> 02:04:02.570
we know that there's not some additional component to a human being because we

2150
02:04:02.571 --> 02:04:06.110
can break down everything that happens when you move an arm or wherever and I

2151
02:04:06.111 --> 02:04:10.580
feel like we only have limited instruments.
We only have limited instruments.

2152
02:04:10.581 --> 02:04:12.770
There's certain frequencies that we simply cannot read.

2153
02:04:12.771 --> 02:04:16.010
What else is going on when people are having these transcendent psychedelic

2154
02:04:16.011 --> 02:04:19.070
experiences,
we're accessing elements of consciousness,

2155
02:04:19.071 --> 02:04:23.240
energies and frequencies that we are not able to access while we're in this

2156
02:04:23.241 --> 02:04:26.210
state and everything we were achieving and everything we're building,

2157
02:04:26.211 --> 02:04:29.660
we're building on this platform and the bias of this platform is towards pri

2158
02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:34.720
progress and materialism and I think the result is fleshy in robots and those

2159
02:04:34.971 --> 02:04:38.940
evil monkey warriors,
soldiers.
We might want to calm down.

2160
02:04:39.150 --> 02:04:42.060
I have a little talk about what it is we're trying to design.
Yeah.

2161
02:04:42.061 --> 02:04:45.600
I don't know if I agree with Brian on that particular point that we think we

2162
02:04:45.601 --> 02:04:48.870
know everything about where consciousness emanates.

2163
02:04:49.140 --> 02:04:50.640
I don't think that's necessarily true,

2164
02:04:50.641 --> 02:04:53.660
but I like the fact that he thinks that way because you sit your rigid hard

2165
02:04:53.661 --> 02:04:57.660
liner for science and the guy works at cern.
I mean,
he's a brilliant,

2166
02:04:57.661 --> 02:04:59.340
brilliant man.
So of course he thinks that way.

2167
02:04:59.550 --> 02:05:03.570
I also don't think he's ever had a DMT experience.
That's right.
I wonder that.

2168
02:05:03.571 --> 02:05:06.370
Yeah,
they say some people I think give him a quick dose.
You know,

2169
02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:09.870
because I as well,
I respect Brian and he's perfect in my point.

2170
02:05:09.871 --> 02:05:13.920
Similar to the hunt in argument,
I can,
you know,
I happen to believe in God,

2171
02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:17.370
but like I,
when I talked to Brian Cox,
I got to the point where I was saying,

2172
02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:21.150
all right,
even though I believe in God and you are an atheist,
so though he said,

2173
02:05:21.151 --> 02:05:22.170
I don't call myself an atheist.

2174
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:25.880
Well I felt like we both got to the point where we said compassion,

2175
02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:30.030
kindness and love are the most important thing.
So in a way,
who cares?

2176
02:05:30.031 --> 02:05:32.220
So when you sit there,
when you see you believe in God,

2177
02:05:32.250 --> 02:05:35.880
do you believe in the traditional God of Christianity?
What do you do?

2178
02:05:35.881 --> 02:05:39.300
You believe in God as a concept?
Do you have your own definition for it?

2179
02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:44.600
That I believe that that state of oneness and transcendence that you're talking

2180
02:05:45.331 --> 02:05:48.210
about when you feel your DMT experiences but says,
you know,

2181
02:05:48.211 --> 02:05:53.100
love and kindness and love and awareness,
I believe that is the most real thing.

2182
02:05:53.130 --> 02:05:56.970
I think that proceeded all matter.
And I think that we,

2183
02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:59.040
that we can interact with it.

2184
02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:02.470
So I don't believe that God in a sort of ingest a guy away,

2185
02:06:02.490 --> 02:06:06.720
that the whole world is like an interactive by biological living,

2186
02:06:06.721 --> 02:06:09.630
breathing God s I believe that we,
I believe yes,

2187
02:06:09.631 --> 02:06:13.560
that and that we can commune with it.
And I am.
Furthermore,

2188
02:06:13.561 --> 02:06:17.640
the relevance of it for me is that it suggests to me that we should be acting

2189
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:19.470
kindly and lovingly.

2190
02:06:19.471 --> 02:06:22.140
And when we're thinking about how do we organize our systems,

2191
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:27.310
that our awareness of that energy accessible to all of us should be paramount in

2192
02:06:28.771 --> 02:06:30.390
our understanding of how we organize.

2193
02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:34.920
So like what I think is like that we should look at,
you know,

2194
02:06:34.921 --> 02:06:38.850
like we've been through as human beings in so many advents that agriculture

2195
02:06:38.851 --> 02:06:42.480
technology industry thinking that we were the,
the,
you know,

2196
02:06:42.481 --> 02:06:45.600
the sun went around their thinking that the earth was flat with all due respect

2197
02:06:45.601 --> 02:06:48.450
to Eddie Bravo,
you know,
and we,

2198
02:06:48.451 --> 02:06:51.870
and before each of these realizations and each of these changes,

2199
02:06:51.871 --> 02:06:53.760
we always think we are at the summit.

2200
02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:56.490
We never know what's going to be the thing that's going to change.

2201
02:06:56.491 --> 02:07:00.480
My suspicion is that what's going to change is out of the way we relate to

2202
02:07:00.481 --> 02:07:03.660
consciousness and the way we see ourselves as individuals that we start having

2203
02:07:03.670 --> 02:07:06.870
an understanding that what the,
that becomes a priority.

2204
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:09.870
That thing you've described.
If like when I've come back from DMT trips,

2205
02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:13.610
I recognize this is just an illusion and it's not real.
I think that will like,

2206
02:07:13.890 --> 02:07:18.450
I believe that we need to prioritize that and progressing along that line.

2207
02:07:18.451 --> 02:07:23.040
What are the implications of this not being the most real frequency there is?

2208
02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:25.290
How do we organize society on that basis?

2209
02:07:25.380 --> 02:07:28.470
How does that affect how we relate to one another?
What kind of,

2210
02:07:28.810 --> 02:07:31.530
how should we be governing?
How,
how does that affect justice?

2211
02:07:31.650 --> 02:07:36.650
That that should be in the mix instead of our many fucking arachnoid weird gait

2212
02:07:37.271 --> 02:07:41.220
robot,
motherfuckers can we cook on?
That's the way we're going,

2213
02:07:41.230 --> 02:07:42.760
the progressive technological route,

2214
02:07:42.761 --> 02:07:45.610
because it's created medicine because it saves so many lives because it's given

2215
02:07:45.611 --> 02:07:48.580
us wonderful technology,
the spirit of entrepreneurialship,

2216
02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:52.510
but all of that energy,
it all gets pushed in one direction.

2217
02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:56.680
They're all goes that way and I feel that we need to invite that back.

2218
02:07:56.681 --> 02:07:59.590
The sacred and the divine need to be back in the conversation.

2219
02:07:59.780 --> 02:08:03.020
<v 3>Well,
there's certainly going to be pros and cons with everything.
You know,</v>

2220
02:08:03.021 --> 02:08:06.230
there's definitely pros and cons with the creation of technology.

2221
02:08:06.740 --> 02:08:07.700
I think of this,

2222
02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:12.410
I think of human beings as if you go back to single celled organisms,

2223
02:08:12.411 --> 02:08:15.830
they have very little awareness of their environment and then as it became

2224
02:08:16.010 --> 02:08:19.550
primitive bugs,
you know,
as as as things evolved,

2225
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:24.320
they develop more awareness.
But even us in comparison to certain animals,

2226
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:28.010
certain now animals have heightened senses of smell and survival instincts.

2227
02:08:28.011 --> 02:08:31.280
But they're also colorblind,
you know,
and they,
they don't see things.

2228
02:08:31.281 --> 02:08:34.340
They see edge detection like this.
One of the things about deer,

2229
02:08:35.450 --> 02:08:39.190
they see movement.
So like if you were a camouflage and you know your,

2230
02:08:39.191 --> 02:08:44.120
your pattern is broken up with a grid and then you stay put,
they don't see you.

2231
02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:47.390
Yeah,
they just did.
It doesn't mean it doesn't register to them.

2232
02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:48.553
They see movement.

2233
02:08:48.830 --> 02:08:53.830
So we have a far more complex system of recognition than they do in terms of

2234
02:08:55.401 --> 02:08:57.110
like visually the way we see things.

2235
02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:02.560
And I think that whatever skills or whatever senses that we've evolved,

2236
02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:08.180
I don't think that's it.
I don't think we've reached the pinnacle of it.

2237
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:12.590
And I think that as beings become more and more evolved,

2238
02:09:12.830 --> 02:09:14.630
they'll probably gain more and more senses.

2239
02:09:14.631 --> 02:09:18.140
And that could be directly related to technology.

2240
02:09:19.820 --> 02:09:23.870
It's totally possible that what's going on with technologies that we're also

2241
02:09:23.871 --> 02:09:28.820
developing through external means a way for us to see the world,

2242
02:09:29.010 --> 02:09:32.090
a way for us to view what they've done with the large Hadron collider is like

2243
02:09:32.091 --> 02:09:35.540
the best example of it,
right?
What they do with the Hubble Space Telescope.

2244
02:09:35.541 --> 02:09:36.950
And other telescopes,
you're,

2245
02:09:36.951 --> 02:09:40.580
you're using technology to gain awareness and to see more things.

2246
02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:45.880
And that this is the good side of technology is that it's allowing us to have a

2247
02:09:46.701 --> 02:09:51.230
far greater understanding of all the variables that surround us that we might

2248
02:09:51.231 --> 02:09:55.280
not be able to detect with our senses.
That this is a part of who we are.

2249
02:09:55.281 --> 02:09:58.850
And then I think when you're talking about things like psychedelic experiences,

2250
02:09:58.851 --> 02:10:02.270
that's probably another realm of understanding that we haven't really achieved

2251
02:10:02.271 --> 02:10:07.040
yet because we're,
we're still evolving as,
as a,
as a species,
as a thing.

2252
02:10:08.010 --> 02:10:12.300
<v 1>What I think is interesting is that the continual bias along that technological</v>

2253
02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:17.670
path is towards profit.
You know,
when we see those machines,

2254
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:21.570
the end point is always how do we make,
how do we maximize profit?

2255
02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:25.680
There is no like the influence of how do we do what's right.

2256
02:10:25.710 --> 02:10:28.200
That's like a sort of a,
a person,

2257
02:10:28.230 --> 02:10:32.490
like a sort of a general ethical,
uh,
what do I want to say?

2258
02:10:32.491 --> 02:10:36.740
Sort of is not being introduced.
There is no regulation like,
uh,
you know,

2259
02:10:36.750 --> 02:10:38.080
look out on that.
You know,

2260
02:10:38.150 --> 02:10:42.860
ultimately people will create the warrior monkeys or the most profitable

2261
02:10:42.861 --> 02:10:47.270
machines people because they're,
the counter argument isn't being made.

2262
02:10:47.271 --> 02:10:50.030
No one is like what I'm saying,
no one's making it there.
There's just,

2263
02:10:50.031 --> 02:10:54.860
there's no union of uh,
you know,
there's no sort of clear opinion of,

2264
02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:57.530
hang on a minute,
where could we be going?
No,

2265
02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:02.560
there is no body or ideology that's able to oppose the relentless march of

2266
02:11:03.471 --> 02:11:06.200
capitalism.
I'm not sort of like a flower or capitalism is bad.

2267
02:11:06.201 --> 02:11:09.980
Here I am promoting a book using or an iPhone or you know what I mean?
Um,

2268
02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:11.810
we're all swimming in it,
right?

2269
02:11:11.811 --> 02:11:16.811
But what I'm saying is that if we acknowledge there are transcendent realms,

2270
02:11:17.050 --> 02:11:21.410
there is information and data that exists beyond what we're able to receive with

2271
02:11:21.411 --> 02:11:25.130
our senses.
How are we going to incorporate that in the way we organize?

2272
02:11:25.131 --> 02:11:27.650
Cause otherwise this off the magnetism,
the Pole,

2273
02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:29.630
the g force of water most profitable,

2274
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:34.750
what's going to continue to suit the requirements of the powerful that will

2275
02:11:35.210 --> 02:11:37.850
always,
the bias will always fall in that direction.

2276
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.480
And it seems like where that's heading is certain kinds of ecological disaster,

2277
02:11:41.570 --> 02:11:44.960
certain kinds of economic inequality,
certain kinds of conflict,
you know,

2278
02:11:44.961 --> 02:11:49.760
and like we're not,
one of them are the simple uh,
uh,
experiments that I apply is,

2279
02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:51.410
you know,
if we,
you know,
if when people say,
oh,

2280
02:11:51.411 --> 02:11:53.780
what's wrong with the world world's I fucked all this polarity,

2281
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:57.140
I sometimes think,
well,
who is benefiting from how it is now?
Are there,

2282
02:11:57.141 --> 02:11:59.210
is anyone benefiting?
Are there any groups,

2283
02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:03.710
institutions or individuals for whom this current state is beneficial?

2284
02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:05.540
And if the answer to that question is yes,

2285
02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:10.870
then look at who those institutions are and they are most likely to a degree

2286
02:12:11.001 --> 02:12:15.620
involved in establishing and maintaining these systems.
And there are,
you know,

2287
02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:21.010
is the tuitions and individuals and organizations that this works just fine for,

2288
02:12:21.210 --> 02:12:24.930
<v 2>but are they just capitalizing on it or are they organizing it and is a normal</v>

2289
02:12:24.931 --> 02:12:29.931
part of the way human beings operate with this constant desire for innovation,

2290
02:12:30.121 --> 02:12:33.740
constant desire for improvement.
We always want to push further.
No,

2291
02:12:33.741 --> 02:12:34.980
no one's comfortable where they are.

2292
02:12:34.981 --> 02:12:36.660
They will always want to be in a better place.

2293
02:12:36.930 --> 02:12:39.660
And this is almost like it's built into capitalism,
right?

2294
02:12:39.670 --> 02:12:42.180
I agree that this materialism,

2295
02:12:42.181 --> 02:12:45.480
which is built into capitalism also is what fuels innovation.
Yeah,

2296
02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:48.690
because you want the newest iPhone so they have to design it and build it and

2297
02:12:48.691 --> 02:12:50.940
make it all right and when new things come out,

2298
02:12:50.941 --> 02:12:54.180
like this new robot that apparently you're going to a hundred models,

2299
02:12:54.181 --> 02:12:55.014
whatever that means.

2300
02:12:55.420 --> 02:13:00.300
What that is is this is is they're going to sell it so there's like it's fueling

2301
02:13:00.301 --> 02:13:02.130
innovation.
Someone else would come along,

2302
02:13:02.170 --> 02:13:05.820
compete with Boston dynamics and then there'll be,
there'll be innovation wars.

2303
02:13:05.821 --> 02:13:09.060
If these innovation wars weren't in place right now,

2304
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:12.570
our phones would look nothing like the iPhone 10 it just wouldn't,

2305
02:13:12.630 --> 02:13:15.420
it wouldn't look like the Esx,
it would look like when those was,

2306
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:17.040
it would look like,
but there would be no,

2307
02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:22.470
no incentive for them to compete against all these Samsung devices and Huawei

2308
02:13:22.471 --> 02:13:25.380
devices and all that stuff is fueling this innovation,

2309
02:13:25.381 --> 02:13:27.030
but it's all being fueled by capitalism.

2310
02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:28.180
<v 1>You're quite right that that,</v>

2311
02:13:28.410 --> 02:13:33.410
that innovation is one of the benefits of the maintaining this system.

2312
02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:38.400
But it seems to me that we are excluding other factors like that,
that,

2313
02:13:38.410 --> 02:13:41.100
that recur throughout human cultures.

2314
02:13:41.101 --> 02:13:45.900
We all have an idea of fairness of justice and yeah,
I don't want some clunky,

2315
02:13:45.901 --> 02:13:50.901
weird sort of eastern bloc phone made out of gray plastic only one button on it.

2316
02:13:52.350 --> 02:13:55.500
But like we have to I suppose,

2317
02:13:55.530 --> 02:14:00.530
examine as a society and as individuals what is important to us where I think,

2318
02:14:01.131 --> 02:14:01.330
you know,

2319
02:14:01.330 --> 02:14:05.400
we've talked touched several times upon the fact that as an individual you're

2320
02:14:05.401 --> 02:14:09.720
more likely to bias yourself towards negative information online.
You know,

2321
02:14:09.721 --> 02:14:14.610
like we do have a degree of individual power and individual responsibility and I

2322
02:14:14.611 --> 02:14:18.870
feel like if enough people awaken to the possibility of different narratives

2323
02:14:18.871 --> 02:14:23.720
that,
that the capitalist idea of innovation and success and progress that,

2324
02:14:23.780 --> 02:14:27.090
that all of these words can be examined.
What do you mean progress?

2325
02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:30.360
That assumes a teleology,
a purpose,
a destination.

2326
02:14:30.510 --> 02:14:33.930
If all time is happening at once.
If space is infinite,

2327
02:14:34.110 --> 02:14:38.460
like you know that bit of yours of liking it to try and fathom for a moment the

2328
02:14:38.461 --> 02:14:42.750
limitlessness that were existing within,
then all these things are constructs.

2329
02:14:42.751 --> 02:14:45.480
This is a construct and it is good to have technology,

2330
02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:50.660
but it's possible to like at points times of crisis such as what it feels like

2331
02:14:51.421 --> 02:14:53.130
we're at now.
Now though that people have said,
well,

2332
02:14:53.131 --> 02:14:56.520
we always feel that every generation thinks that they're the one because they

2333
02:14:56.521 --> 02:14:59.740
know their own impending death is coming and they narrativize that into

2334
02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:02.670
something social and global regardless.

2335
02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:06.180
There's got to be a time where we start to introduce different ideas into our

2336
02:15:06.181 --> 02:15:09.680
systems.
It seems like there's room for that now because we do live in a toe,

2337
02:15:09.940 --> 02:15:14.880
a truly global culture that there is the possibility for monoliths to introduce

2338
02:15:14.881 --> 02:15:18.540
new innovation and there is nothing that can oppose it or regulate it.

2339
02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:20.340
We're starting to see this kind of breakdown.

2340
02:15:20.610 --> 02:15:25.610
So I'm interested in how we can individually prepare ourselves to organize

2341
02:15:26.341 --> 02:15:28.080
society differently.

2342
02:15:28.170 --> 02:15:31.980
To be able to overcome pretty superficial differences.
Like,
Oh,

2343
02:15:31.981 --> 02:15:35.310
you go hunting and I don't go hunt in,
we,
I really gives a fuck.

2344
02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:38.780
They start talking about how we can organize the size where people who go on in,

2345
02:15:38.781 --> 02:15:42.060
it'll don't go hunting,
can live peacefully in different ways,

2346
02:15:42.061 --> 02:15:45.990
not entirely governed by a small cabal.
You know?

2347
02:15:45.991 --> 02:15:49.980
And and I'm sure plat power is more complex and that that seemed to be hugely

2348
02:15:49.981 --> 02:15:52.140
biasing the direction of this.
So called pro.

2349
02:15:52.810 --> 02:15:55.990
<v 2>I think you answered your own previous questions when you're talking about</v>

2350
02:15:55.991 --> 02:15:58.960
whether or not you can be spiritual and funny and like what are you doing?

2351
02:15:58.961 --> 02:16:00.850
Can you carve that path out for yourself?

2352
02:16:01.150 --> 02:16:05.470
That what you're doing there by explaining that would influence people,

2353
02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:08.380
would give people a perspective that allows them to say,
yeah,

2354
02:16:08.381 --> 02:16:10.840
like why are we doing this and what is the purpose of this?

2355
02:16:10.841 --> 02:16:15.280
And if enough people hear those words and have that perspective introduced to

2356
02:16:15.281 --> 02:16:18.310
them,
it'll change the way they interact with the world.

2357
02:16:18.311 --> 02:16:20.530
And that changes the world.
It really does.

2358
02:16:20.590 --> 02:16:24.160
And that's one of the more powerful things about discussions.

2359
02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:27.640
When someone like you says something like that and it resonates with people and

2360
02:16:27.641 --> 02:16:29.980
they start thinking like,
why am I living this?
Like what

2361
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:33.700
<v 3>if I'm only have,
if I really do only have 50 years to live,</v>

2362
02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:38.770
why am I living these 50 years in some really unproductive bullshit way that's

2363
02:16:38.771 --> 02:16:42.520
not satisfying at all?
Cause I just want a bigger house.
Like what is it?

2364
02:16:42.521 --> 02:16:47.500
Do I want a faster car?
Do I want to have expensive piece of jewelry?

2365
02:16:47.501 --> 02:16:48.310
Like what is,

2366
02:16:48.310 --> 02:16:52.510
what is the purpose of this path that I'm on now versus a path that I could be

2367
02:16:52.511 --> 02:16:53.140
on?

2368
02:16:53.140 --> 02:16:58.140
And what is the real conflict that we all experienced between each other?

2369
02:16:58.451 --> 02:17:01.840
Is it,
how much of it is due to a lack of communication?

2370
02:17:01.841 --> 02:17:04.750
How much of is due to a lack of real listening and understanding?

2371
02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:07.840
And one of the things I've said about like comments and podcasts and stuff like

2372
02:17:07.841 --> 02:17:10.060
that,
I think one of the reasons why a lot of people get mad,

2373
02:17:10.061 --> 02:17:12.760
and I've tried to think this through,
like why some people,

2374
02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:16.750
some of the responses so negative to things that don't it seem innocuous on the

2375
02:17:16.751 --> 02:17:21.530
outside.
I think it's because it's frustrating when you don't have a say.
Yeah,

2376
02:17:21.570 --> 02:17:23.720
give to people like see you and I are talking about something.

2377
02:17:23.721 --> 02:17:25.510
It's probably some guy right now going,

2378
02:17:25.690 --> 02:17:29.920
what jobs fucking stop with all your spiritual bullshit.

2379
02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:33.250
Here's what you do.
You'll wake up when you're fucking alarm clock goes off.

2380
02:17:33.310 --> 02:17:37.180
You never hit snooze.
You get out the door,
you put your hours in.

2381
02:17:37.181 --> 02:17:39.610
Eventually you get better.
You take care of your family,

2382
02:17:39.790 --> 02:17:42.370
you act like a fucking man.
And there's probably people like that,

2383
02:17:42.390 --> 02:17:45.430
that they're upset that they feel like we're pontificating too much.

2384
02:17:45.431 --> 02:17:47.160
And this is all just,
you know,

2385
02:17:47.290 --> 02:17:50.680
just mental masturbation the ways it is.

2386
02:17:50.681 --> 02:17:53.680
But that's part of how you'd solve these things and think these things through.

2387
02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:57.290
<v 1>I believe they deserve their say.
Yeah.
Well,
and that's one of the things that,</v>

2388
02:17:57.291 --> 02:17:57.500
you know,

2389
02:17:57.500 --> 02:18:01.430
I've been a person that goes to sort of 12 step support groups is you recognize

2390
02:18:01.431 --> 02:18:05.900
that everyone's individual experience is valuable.
It's not like that.

2391
02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:11.140
And I've got over the idea that there's some external thing can be imposed and

2392
02:18:11.630 --> 02:18:14.870
like,
you know,
whilst there are many people that are,
you know,

2393
02:18:14.930 --> 02:18:19.760
we could say not using their 50 years to maximum effect because there are,

2394
02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:23.600
you know,
pursuing odd material goals.
There are many,

2395
02:18:23.601 --> 02:18:27.830
many more people that have never been introduced to the idea of freedom because

2396
02:18:27.831 --> 02:18:28.730
from the moment they're born,

2397
02:18:28.731 --> 02:18:32.150
they're economically tyrannized and told that your only,

2398
02:18:32.151 --> 02:18:34.460
if you are not economically valuable to their system,

2399
02:18:34.490 --> 02:18:38.690
you are not valuable at all.
And that isn't,
that's only an idea.
But you know,

2400
02:18:38.691 --> 02:18:43.130
if you don't,
if you can't become a lawyer or you know,
a comedian or whatever,

2401
02:18:43.131 --> 02:18:43.880
fuck you.

2402
02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:48.260
<v 3>Well so many of us are trapped in the expectations and values of our parents
too.</v>

2403
02:18:48.470 --> 02:18:52.880
That's a real problem with people.
Don't let their children become an individual.

2404
02:18:53.050 --> 02:18:56.870
You know,
they force their children to follow their own rigid ideology.

2405
02:18:56.900 --> 02:18:58.340
They shame them when they don't.

2406
02:18:58.410 --> 02:18:59.370
<v 1>I agree with that,</v>

2407
02:18:59.371 --> 02:19:03.750
but do you not imagine that a dick fair degree of that stuff is unconscious?

2408
02:19:03.751 --> 02:19:05.180
Do you,
don't get to you and I agree for sure.

2409
02:19:05.330 --> 02:19:08.350
Probably unconsciously imposing things on our kids.

2410
02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:12.790
<v 3>100% but not with guilt and women.
If your kid comes to you and say,
Dad,</v>

2411
02:19:12.791 --> 02:19:14.460
I didn't know.
I know you wanted me to be a doctor,

2412
02:19:14.461 --> 02:19:15.960
but fucking I want to play bongos.

2413
02:19:16.410 --> 02:19:18.480
I just want to be the best Bongo player of all time.

2414
02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:21.880
I bet you'd probably be like,
Hey,
learn the fucking pause.

2415
02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:26.520
Give me a hug and I'll go get those bongos come the best damn band.
Goa.

2416
02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:28.370
You can dare.
Or even mediocre.

2417
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:32.270
<v 2>Sure,
but there are fathers out there.
I'd be like,
the fuck you are.</v>

2418
02:19:32.271 --> 02:19:33.680
You're going to be a goddamn doctor.

2419
02:19:33.681 --> 02:19:37.070
Stop being a pussy and you're going to go back to medical school and you got to

2420
02:19:37.071 --> 02:19:37.371
pick up,

2421
02:19:37.371 --> 02:19:40.250
your studies are going to get you a tutor and you're going to perform because

2422
02:19:40.251 --> 02:19:44.540
we're all Wilson,
Wilson and Wilson family's been physicians,

2423
02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:49.200
so it's 1820 your brand time immemorial.
If the Wilson's have been positioned,

2424
02:19:49.201 --> 02:19:51.950
he made people buy down on a leather strap before amnesia.

2425
02:19:51.951 --> 02:19:56.030
They sought off legs and he kept those people alive.
You want to play Bongos?

2426
02:19:56.031 --> 02:19:58.490
You little fuck yeah,
people get mad.

2427
02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:01.680
<v 1>But my bias is towards my kid,
like,
uh,</v>

2428
02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:04.750
like sort of like when we was back in England,

2429
02:20:04.780 --> 02:20:07.000
like I was aware of like grandparents or whatever,

2430
02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:10.590
reacting a spiders and stuff going,
oh,
spiders is scary.

2431
02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:13.660
I'm a dumb fucking teach them that spiders are scary.

2432
02:20:13.661 --> 02:20:16.120
I don't want her to think of things is scary.

2433
02:20:16.121 --> 02:20:18.880
Tell it that this spot is a call there.
All right.
There's nothing,
you know,

2434
02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:22.810
like you say and you're aware of familial influence like that.

2435
02:20:22.811 --> 02:20:24.490
They wanted the hair to be a certain way.

2436
02:20:24.491 --> 02:20:26.970
They want them to wear certain things they want them to like,
yeah.

2437
02:20:27.090 --> 02:20:30.160
Part of the veganism is like,
if you make these kids Vegan,

2438
02:20:30.250 --> 02:20:32.080
at least now I know wherever they go,

2439
02:20:32.081 --> 02:20:33.760
there's gonna be so many restrictions on their food.

2440
02:20:33.761 --> 02:20:36.910
I've not made the kids Vegan like where the hell they want.
It's up to them.
Yeah.

2441
02:20:36.911 --> 02:20:41.640
Thank you.
Where's my goats.
Dot.
Where's my ticker tape parade.
But like,
so,

2442
02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:45.310
but like,
you know,
I don't know what car,
you know,

2443
02:20:45.490 --> 02:20:48.250
we don't know our own biases.
We don't know what,

2444
02:20:48.251 --> 02:20:52.030
where we've been institutionalized,
you know,
cause how,
you know,

2445
02:20:52.031 --> 02:20:55.110
the very nature of their unconscious is we are not aware of it,
you know?

2446
02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:56.650
So I suppose in a sense a cook,

2447
02:20:56.680 --> 02:21:00.820
it continued open mindedness and willingness to change must be part of any

2448
02:21:00.821 --> 02:21:05.230
dialogue to go into the seat driving general.
I might not actually know what's,

2449
02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:09.310
that's why I'm not,
when I was 20,
if you were to sit about the hunt in,

2450
02:21:09.460 --> 02:21:12.730
I'd be like,
oh no man,
no.
I'm like,
yeah,
Jesus,

2451
02:21:12.731 --> 02:21:14.290
there's so many ways of seeing the world.

2452
02:21:14.350 --> 02:21:17.610
There's so many ways of looking at what's natural and what's correct.
Um,

2453
02:21:17.650 --> 02:21:19.300
you know,
what do I know?
Hunting,

2454
02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:23.590
<v 2>hunting is like many things in that.
There's no real clean answer.</v>

2455
02:21:23.591 --> 02:21:27.940
There's no yes or no good or bad because you could think there is.

2456
02:21:27.941 --> 02:21:32.941
But then you find circumstances like wild pigs or invasive species.

2457
02:21:33.081 --> 02:21:36.520
Like I go hunting on a place called the knights and one of the small islands of

2458
02:21:36.521 --> 02:21:37.470
Hawaii.
Mm.

2459
02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:42.680
There's somewhere in the neighborhood of 3000 people and 20,000 deer.

2460
02:21:45.460 --> 02:21:49.690
It is so overpopulated with deer and they have to kill them.

2461
02:21:49.691 --> 02:21:52.350
They killed them every day.
They hire snipers.
They hire people to get on.

2462
02:21:52.360 --> 02:21:55.960
People were slamming and with their cars.
I mean,
they are fucking everywhere.

2463
02:21:55.961 --> 02:21:59.610
And their access deer,
they're not even from there.
They're from,
uh,

2464
02:21:59.650 --> 02:22:04.030
someone brought them over from India to give to King Kamehameha and like the 18

2465
02:22:04.031 --> 02:22:07.450
hundreds there.
Their animals actually that evolve to get away from tigers.

2466
02:22:07.570 --> 02:22:11.740
So there's this insanely fast,
beautiful deer that are everywhere.

2467
02:22:11.790 --> 02:22:13.360
They're forced to kill.
Well,

2468
02:22:13.361 --> 02:22:16.390
the good news is the people that are a low income people,

2469
02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:19.780
the island always have meat.
There's,
there's meet everywhere.
Everyone can haunt.

2470
02:22:19.781 --> 02:22:23.140
It's really easy to find them.
You can,
you could find them and if you,
you know,

2471
02:22:23.350 --> 02:22:26.070
if you want,
you can go kill him.
Yeah,
I've got no moral

2472
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:28.860
<v 1>judgment about that.
You know,
if there's rats in my house,
what,</v>

2473
02:22:28.861 --> 02:22:31.740
I'm not going to put down poison.
I'm going to go.
Oh,
but that's the thing,
right?

2474
02:22:31.900 --> 02:22:36.060
We're allowed to flourish.
You should probably feel bad about killing a rat.

2475
02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:41.050
Right?
As a Vegan.
I do feel bad spot.
I'm hungry.
What about like,

2476
02:22:42.270 --> 02:22:46.890
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't swap a mosquito.
Even the Dalai Lama,

2477
02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:52.440
even the Dalai Lama low.
I see him.
He went like the first time a gentle brush.

2478
02:22:52.441 --> 02:22:54.890
The second time,
a harder one for time.
Smack the data.

2479
02:22:55.060 --> 02:22:57.510
Like the Dalai Lama gives them free chances.

2480
02:22:59.690 --> 02:23:02.300
Then you're out.
You might be reincarnated as saint back.

2481
02:23:02.310 --> 02:23:04.860
Can I go for a tea please?
Yeah,
sure,
sure.
Go ahead man.

2482
02:23:05.610 --> 02:23:07.410
It's almost three o'clock already if you believe it or not.

2483
02:23:10.850 --> 02:23:12.060
Fresh in my bladder was under.

2484
02:23:15.310 --> 02:23:19.810
<v 2>He's such a character.
His neat,
he's got these incredibly long rants,</v>

2485
02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:20.650
you know,

2486
02:23:20.650 --> 02:23:25.650
but he's so I'm self aware and introspective is always analyzing himself.

2487
02:23:25.691 --> 02:23:26.980
Trying to find if he's doing right,

2488
02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:32.950
I get a kick of these celebrity dude's doing Jujitsu too.
I think it's hilarious.

2489
02:23:33.070 --> 02:23:37.030
It's awesome.
It's cool.
It's cool to hear him talk about it.
You could tell,

2490
02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:38.920
you know,
the struggles with it.

2491
02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:42.220
I just saw someone else said they just started it and I can't remember who it

2492
02:23:42.221 --> 02:23:46.240
was.
Someone famous.
Yeah.
Might not be relevant at all,
but I'm trying to think.

2493
02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:49.150
Demi Lovato is like a purple belt or some shit.

2494
02:23:49.690 --> 02:23:52.600
She's been doing it for a long time.
Uh,
Russell,

2495
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:55.810
who I've trained with it Russell's a legit blue belt.

2496
02:23:56.380 --> 02:24:00.500
I rolled with Russell and I was like,
wow.
Russell really knows Jujitsu.

2497
02:24:00.580 --> 02:24:03.400
He's actually doing the right stuff here.
It's hard.

2498
02:24:04.390 --> 02:24:09.390
It's hard for someone to go from a place of where a guy like Russell brand is

2499
02:24:11.740 --> 02:24:14.050
handsome,
beautiful,

2500
02:24:14.051 --> 02:24:19.051
famous man who is got some strange plumber sitting on his face.

2501
02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:24.340
He ain't going on his arm.
And his description of it is awesome.
Yeah.

2502
02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:28.250
It feels with bow feces in his bowels and yeah,

2503
02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:34.720
that veganism stuffs for the birds though.
Sorry.
Vegan people to eat eggs.

2504
02:24:34.780 --> 02:24:37.150
If you don't want to kill any animals,
please just find,

2505
02:24:37.180 --> 02:24:41.290
find a good farm that has pasture raised eggs and see how much better you feel

2506
02:24:42.190 --> 02:24:47.170
or eat animals that are assholes.
Find animals that are assholes in the woods.

2507
02:24:47.350 --> 02:24:48.550
Only at the assholes.

2508
02:24:49.630 --> 02:24:53.520
Somebody sent me this horrible video that I've seen many times before of a a

2509
02:24:53.530 --> 02:24:57.800
bear,
uh,
killing a deer in the backyard and the deer screaming the barest,

2510
02:24:57.940 --> 02:25:01.240
tearing it apart.
I'm sure you've seen that before,
right?
And uh,

2511
02:25:01.270 --> 02:25:04.000
he sent it to me and he goes,
okay,
now I get it.

2512
02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:09.910
Like I didn't think,
I thought like if a bear got a deer,

2513
02:25:10.210 --> 02:25:14.440
that it would be just,
oh,
hey,
this is just how nature works.
Like,
no,

2514
02:25:14.441 --> 02:25:19.420
this is horrific violent act of this animal tearing this other animal apart.

2515
02:25:19.421 --> 02:25:22.570
Now,
would you prefer that than a hunter?

2516
02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:27.850
Because 99 times out of a hundred,
when a hunter kills an animal,

2517
02:25:27.851 --> 02:25:30.820
it's way quicker there.
That's the video.
It's horrible.

2518
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:36.130
It's a horrible video.
This animal,
I think it's actually a black bear.

2519
02:25:36.131 --> 02:25:39.880
I think it's either a grizzly or a color phase black bear.

2520
02:25:39.881 --> 02:25:43.750
But it takes a long time too.
If you,
if you haven't seen the video,

2521
02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:47.650
it's a long one.
And the animal makes them horrible noises.

2522
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:49.750
We're talking about a Russell returns.

2523
02:25:50.110 --> 02:25:54.970
We're talking about a video that I've seen before about this bear that kills

2524
02:25:54.971 --> 02:25:57.850
this deer in this guy's yard and the guy films in the years making these

2525
02:25:57.851 --> 02:26:02.350
horrible noises and uh,
this guy sent,
sent it to me and he goes,

2526
02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:03.970
now I get it.
He goes like,

2527
02:26:03.971 --> 02:26:07.150
get with the wild is actually all about because you don't really see it that

2528
02:26:07.151 --> 02:26:07.984
much.
You don't really,

2529
02:26:08.050 --> 02:26:10.720
it's very rare the actually seeing an animal kill an animal.

2530
02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:15.730
So we have these romantic dignified ideas of what the food chain looks like out

2531
02:26:15.731 --> 02:26:16.200
there.

2532
02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:17.490
<v 1>Yeah.
Nature is brutal.</v>

2533
02:26:17.491 --> 02:26:22.470
I mean I don't try and impose on my dog the kind of conditions that would help

2534
02:26:22.471 --> 02:26:23.640
my shelf too.

2535
02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:26.580
<v 2>You should have an organic garden if you really want to do it right.</v>

2536
02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:29.040
Because if you're getting into large scale agriculture,

2537
02:26:29.041 --> 02:26:30.990
you're buying food from people that grow it.

2538
02:26:31.260 --> 02:26:36.030
They're running over fucking rabbits and mice and killing things with pesticides

2539
02:26:36.031 --> 02:26:38.970
and there's no,
there's no removing yourself from death,

2540
02:26:39.180 --> 02:26:41.700
but just by eating vegetables,
it's just you don't,

2541
02:26:42.020 --> 02:26:46.410
they have to re also they have to like when with large scale agriculture there,

2542
02:26:46.411 --> 02:26:49.890
that ground,
all those animals get displaced,

2543
02:26:50.820 --> 02:26:54.270
fucks the whole ecosystem up,
whatever area they're planting on,

2544
02:26:54.271 --> 02:26:58.260
and then when they roll over it with those gigantic combines and pull up that

2545
02:26:58.261 --> 02:26:59.850
grain,
they're chewing up everything.

2546
02:26:59.851 --> 02:27:02.910
That's why vultures always circle where combines are.

2547
02:27:02.911 --> 02:27:04.140
As soon as they have fresh cut,

2548
02:27:04.170 --> 02:27:06.600
the vulture starts showing up because they know there's going to be something

2549
02:27:06.601 --> 02:27:07.434
that got jacked.

2550
02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:13.080
<v 1>Did she know that that mono culture is unhealthy?</v>

2551
02:27:13.310 --> 02:27:18.310
They're only resistance to [inaudible] like permaculture and healthier.

2552
02:27:19.170 --> 02:27:23.980
Better agricultural models is commerce and profit.
That's okay.

2553
02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:27.770
No,
no,
no.
You communes which you could have as a community gardens.
Yes,

2554
02:27:27.771 --> 02:27:30.860
yes you could,
but the only way,
but if you start,
if we start saying,
hey,

2555
02:27:30.861 --> 02:27:34.720
why don't we not have mono culture anymore because it's unfair and it's

2556
02:27:34.721 --> 02:27:37.310
unreasonable,
reasonable,
they go,
we can't because a,

2557
02:27:37.370 --> 02:27:40.130
it's profitable to have it and people won't bow forward food.

2558
02:27:40.250 --> 02:27:42.240
But all of that is like it,
you know,
a city,
a city,

2559
02:27:42.241 --> 02:27:46.340
an interrelated system that's sort of grid locked into protecting itself.

2560
02:27:46.750 --> 02:27:46.971
You know,

2561
02:27:46.971 --> 02:27:51.920
like there's this spiritual Maxime wisdom is acting on knowledge and that is not

2562
02:27:51.921 --> 02:27:55.850
the world we live in.
We know things and then we just ignore it,
you know,
like,

2563
02:27:55.870 --> 02:27:59.120
or as individuals or as or as you know,

2564
02:27:59.570 --> 02:28:03.830
corporations and as groups and like what I feel like I'm trying to do as an

2565
02:28:03.831 --> 02:28:05.710
individual is hold myself to that standard.

2566
02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:08.960
Like I know that's not good for me to do that anymore.
I'm not going to do that.

2567
02:28:08.961 --> 02:28:09.740
I'm going to do like,
oh,

2568
02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:12.950
I'm going to watch myself and I'm going to watch that behavior and I'm going to

2569
02:28:12.951 --> 02:28:15.860
try and improve.
You know,
like I don't want to go.

2570
02:28:15.890 --> 02:28:20.090
Like when my first impulse and heading down to the day he Biro Jujitsu places,

2571
02:28:20.091 --> 02:28:22.700
I feel nervous and I'm feel confident doing it.

2572
02:28:22.701 --> 02:28:25.880
I don't want to go or whether it's like giving up meat or whatever,

2573
02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:27.750
but I'm doing these things.
In a sense,
those,

2574
02:28:27.751 --> 02:28:30.020
I think these are the kinds of improvements I can make now.

2575
02:28:30.021 --> 02:28:34.340
Like when we almost don't expect that of politics anymore.

2576
02:28:34.370 --> 02:28:38.210
You don't expect a sort of a political figure to say,
well look,
listen,

2577
02:28:38.211 --> 02:28:41.030
monoculture is having a terrible impact.
They'll make some gestural thing,

2578
02:28:41.031 --> 02:28:41.870
wouldn't they?
They'd go,
look,

2579
02:28:41.871 --> 02:28:45.610
we're going to try and control Facebook and Google a little bit and we're going

2580
02:28:45.611 --> 02:28:48.980
to try and reduce emissions this amount.
Now we'll go,
listen,

2581
02:28:48.981 --> 02:28:49.700
we know that's wrong.

2582
02:28:49.700 --> 02:28:53.210
We're not to do that anymore because there's too many powerful interests.

2583
02:28:53.211 --> 02:28:55.820
That's why I was susceptible to the Vegan documentary.
You know?

2584
02:28:55.821 --> 02:28:59.630
Of course there's the ethical reasons in my opinion for becoming Vegan,

2585
02:28:59.750 --> 02:29:03.140
but because it's like the reason that these kinds of foods are promoted is

2586
02:29:03.141 --> 02:29:08.141
because these powerful groups lobby government and lobby the group,

2587
02:29:08.420 --> 02:29:12.740
the organizations that set the standards until they shut up and comply.

2588
02:29:13.310 --> 02:29:18.310
You could sort of say that about vegetable based foods to power league and

2589
02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:23.740
obviously some sea
vegetables,
just corn just growing,

2590
02:29:23.741 --> 02:29:28.700
right?
If definitely monoculture
as the same.
That is the same.

2591
02:29:28.701 --> 02:29:31.430
You know like you're saying that the reason that is continuing is because it's

2592
02:29:31.431 --> 02:29:32.241
profitable and that,

2593
02:29:32.241 --> 02:29:35.840
but these ideas aren't going to get explored because we are on one path,

2594
02:29:35.841 --> 02:29:37.460
one teleological journey.

2595
02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:41.240
Like that's sometimes what I feel like when people talk about the frets of

2596
02:29:41.241 --> 02:29:45.830
different cultural influence,
Eg Islam for example.
Right.

2597
02:29:46.050 --> 02:29:46.401
I feel like,

2598
02:29:46.401 --> 02:29:50.690
well we already live in a kind of fundamentalism that's invisible to us because

2599
02:29:50.691 --> 02:29:51.051
it's all,

2600
02:29:51.051 --> 02:29:55.220
we know we live in a culture that if something isn't profitable it will not

2601
02:29:55.221 --> 02:29:58.400
survive and I don't think that's how human beings are set up to exist.

2602
02:29:58.730 --> 02:30:03.280
I have this rather lovely anecdote about like I was coming back from a Gig and

2603
02:30:03.281 --> 02:30:06.350
it was a woman like she,
her car broke down the side of the road.
I had a driver,

2604
02:30:06.351 --> 02:30:09.140
forgive me,
forgive me,
I'm not poor anymore.
Forgive me.

2605
02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:11.120
I had a drive and we see this woman,
she's back.

2606
02:30:11.140 --> 02:30:13.790
The car side of the road of cars broke down and different light.

2607
02:30:14.030 --> 02:30:18.170
It's a nighttime and let few different people stop and help are the first guy is

2608
02:30:18.171 --> 02:30:19.100
like aces in England.

2609
02:30:19.101 --> 02:30:23.510
It's like a Polish immigrant guy comes and helps you know my driver's Muslim

2610
02:30:23.511 --> 02:30:27.320
gazer he's helping.
I'm trying to help.
Pretty inefficient.

2611
02:30:27.321 --> 02:30:29.660
Mersay cause you know like if you're a famous person,

2612
02:30:29.661 --> 02:30:33.110
when you go into a situation there's sometimes you don't want to be recognized.

2613
02:30:33.140 --> 02:30:36.170
Is that the time just kind of good to be recognized when you're not recognized

2614
02:30:36.171 --> 02:30:40.010
at all?
I always think,
oh I'm not being a or recognized in this attrition.

2615
02:30:40.040 --> 02:30:41.390
No one recognized me in that time.

2616
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:45.290
So I've just a weird Giza or the side of the road trying to help someone who had

2617
02:30:45.291 --> 02:30:48.710
a minor accident without any relevant skills.

2618
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:51.950
Then someone stopped with relevant skills.
He was like a paramedic.

2619
02:30:52.100 --> 02:30:55.040
He took control of the situation.
He was ordering people around you stand here,

2620
02:30:55.041 --> 02:30:57.530
you do this.
Go and get that.
Go and get my head torch.

2621
02:30:57.531 --> 02:30:59.510
He said at one point he had a fucking head torch.

2622
02:30:59.511 --> 02:31:04.000
This guy serious and like he like,
he brilliantly resolved the situation.
Um,

2623
02:31:05.390 --> 02:31:10.120
you mean like a light?
He had a head torch.
Torch.

2624
02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:14.400
Like a light.
I'm sorry.
Is He Bernie's and welding?
How's it doing?

2625
02:31:15.210 --> 02:31:18.510
He all right.
Fair enough.
Yeah.
This seems a little bit here.

2626
02:31:18.970 --> 02:31:20.700
I just wanted to clarify.
I'm

2627
02:31:20.700 --> 02:31:24.870
<v 0>not kind of strange people.
The way you spelled tires.
Like what's that?</v>

2628
02:31:24.871 --> 02:31:28.300
Why doing in there that's necessary.
Thanks for Queen.

2629
02:31:28.770 --> 02:31:30.450
Is Color have a u in it.

2630
02:31:31.350 --> 02:31:35.690
You can eat that you to round off the second syllable of color.

2631
02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:39.240
You savage,
young brutes with your color.

2632
02:31:41.580 --> 02:31:46.010
Color.
Color,
sneaker sneaker.

2633
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:51.160
We can't even pronounce a sport that we do.
I mean it's a,

2634
02:31:51.180 --> 02:31:55.830
it's a Burnham catastrophe.
The way to burn him.
Bernie,
I know.

2635
02:31:55.831 --> 02:32:00.240
Burning Ha.
Birmingham,
Birmingham,
Birmingham,
Birmingham,

2636
02:32:00.900 --> 02:32:01.170
this,

2637
02:32:01.170 --> 02:32:04.980
and this guy had what you would evidently call a headlight or even that doesn't

2638
02:32:04.981 --> 02:32:09.430
sound right beside the lamp headlamp and the old thing to have in your vehicle.

2639
02:32:09.530 --> 02:32:14.070
No,
no,
no.
I have one headlamp in your car.
Well,
you anticipate in,

2640
02:32:14.100 --> 02:32:17.520
if you get stuck somewhere,
man,
anything happens.
You should have a headlamp.

2641
02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:20.160
This is the kind of person that you want pulling over.
Well,
listen,

2642
02:32:20.161 --> 02:32:21.150
when you go hunting,

2643
02:32:21.151 --> 02:32:24.030
one of the things that happens is you're in the woods and when that happens,

2644
02:32:24.031 --> 02:32:26.580
when the sun goes down,
you can't see where the fuck you're going.

2645
02:32:26.820 --> 02:32:30.660
You have to have a headlamp.
How every hunter very far.

2646
02:32:30.790 --> 02:32:35.520
I've a really good one.
A really good one.
So lighting stuff up,

2647
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:39.120
isn't that going to alert the Oh,
you're,
you're no hunt at night,
right?

2648
02:32:39.210 --> 02:32:42.420
It was illegal.
Once the sun goes down,
there's no hunting.

2649
02:32:42.421 --> 02:32:44.760
You have to be able to see what you're shooting.
You shoot a person,

2650
02:32:45.150 --> 02:32:47.010
so you have these funds,
him sorts of rules,

2651
02:32:47.011 --> 02:32:50.130
lights on your head or just to help you navigate through the woods and to spot

2652
02:32:50.131 --> 02:32:53.130
predators.
Because of course if you're vulnerable,
you know,

2653
02:32:53.131 --> 02:32:57.000
and you see giant eyes ahead that are nine feet off the ground,
you're like,

2654
02:32:57.060 --> 02:33:02.060
oh fuck,
it's a bear.
She wakes,
retreat,
come in.
It's like hold on.

2655
02:33:02.070 --> 02:33:04.380
The hunters that happens.

2656
02:33:04.500 --> 02:33:08.670
I've had experiences where I've run into predators in the wild.
Uh,
particularly,

2657
02:33:08.700 --> 02:33:11.830
uh,
one time in Canada I ran into a grizzly bear and uh,

2658
02:33:11.880 --> 02:33:14.760
looking in the eyes and it wasn't even a big one.
It was like a six foot bear.

2659
02:33:14.790 --> 02:33:18.150
Wasn't huge,
but it looks right through you.
It looks right to you.

2660
02:33:18.151 --> 02:33:22.200
And so when you run into an animal that's killing shit every day and it looks at

2661
02:33:22.201 --> 02:33:25.890
you,
there's like a demonic look at its eyes.
I've mean,

2662
02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:30.690
I've seen black bears before.
You don't see that look of a grizzly bear,
which is,

2663
02:33:30.691 --> 02:33:33.570
you know,
more predatory.
They have a crazy look in her eyes.

2664
02:33:33.571 --> 02:33:37.740
It's really interesting.
I made eye contact with a couple of predators,

2665
02:33:37.940 --> 02:33:42.600
a shock once in a shark cage on like when I was doing that film,
Sarah Marshall,

2666
02:33:42.601 --> 02:33:43.434
that 10 years ago,

2667
02:33:43.700 --> 02:33:47.880
well when in a shark cage and right and lay lower you down and you see a shape,

2668
02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:51.000
a shot come towards you.
It's like it's swimming through time.
It's like,

2669
02:33:51.001 --> 02:33:54.270
it's come from every area.
It looks at you.
We'd like you think,
oh Whoa,
fuck,

2670
02:33:54.271 --> 02:33:58.470
you know,
unlike,
and I was terrified in that cage and lighten that Ed Norton,

2671
02:33:58.471 --> 02:34:01.190
which there and with the Allison,
they were on the island as well.

2672
02:34:01.210 --> 02:34:02.760
They were mates for people that were in the movie.

2673
02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:05.610
They go in the water outside of the cage.
Other,

2674
02:34:05.611 --> 02:34:07.680
other fucking mind that seems sign,
isn't it?

2675
02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:10.170
This shock was little and apparently is not a kind of shot each.
She,

2676
02:34:10.171 --> 02:34:12.480
but even the eye contact and then,
and it's fucking teeth.

2677
02:34:12.481 --> 02:34:13.500
I don't even look at it.

2678
02:34:13.770 --> 02:34:18.610
And then another thing I looked at once I was in a tiger sanctuary in India

2679
02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:22.690
<v 1>and I like,
uh,
I didn't let the vehicle while I was in,
Oh,
this is a,
I should,</v>

2680
02:34:23.170 --> 02:34:26.560
I should have made clear that I should I say uncomfortable.

2681
02:34:26.830 --> 02:34:28.150
There's a bad cheap over there.

2682
02:34:28.151 --> 02:34:30.850
So I've got out of it to transition and my mate goes,

2683
02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:33.880
or you want to get in the car now my is a fucking tiger over there.

2684
02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:36.970
And it was a tiger like only 10 foot away.

2685
02:34:38.380 --> 02:34:40.870
Maybe I'm exaggerating.
Hold up 20 foot maximum.

2686
02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:43.300
Like if it was near and the way that that thing looks,

2687
02:34:43.330 --> 02:34:45.850
I mean cause it's so beautiful as well.

2688
02:34:45.851 --> 02:34:50.470
The intensity of being looked at by that fucking creature have some powerful

2689
02:34:50.471 --> 02:34:52.540
shit.
You don't want eye contact with her.

2690
02:34:52.620 --> 02:34:54.640
I don't want to look at something that's got like that.

2691
02:34:54.641 --> 02:34:56.620
You can't negotiate with the ICAN.

2692
02:34:56.650 --> 02:34:58.500
I feel that he'd look at me even with the Jujitsu,

2693
02:34:58.540 --> 02:35:02.170
like I've got that little moment where I go,
hey,
come on this Elle Russ.
Yeah,

2694
02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:06.280
we have a tie.
Go.
She doesn't care about your mortgage.
Yeah.
Neither does that.

2695
02:35:06.281 --> 02:35:10.270
Grizzly bear doesn't care.
They'd look through your kids.
Yeah.
They don't care.
No,

2696
02:35:10.970 --> 02:35:12.990
<v 3>but that's all it's doing all day long.</v>

2697
02:35:13.820 --> 02:35:18.050
<v 1>Unbelievable.
Cause that's as true as everything we reflect on it.
Just to ask,</v>

2698
02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:20.260
who gives a shit about your theories?
I don't

2699
02:35:20.260 --> 02:35:21.400
<v 3>know what that is.</v>

2700
02:35:21.430 --> 02:35:25.960
So their idea of what the wild is is really based on two things.
One,

2701
02:35:25.980 --> 02:35:30.790
their their actual love of animals.
They know,
right?
It's like dogs and cats.

2702
02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:34.480
So the animals that we know we,
we,
we have this connection with them.

2703
02:35:34.481 --> 02:35:38.380
So we think that these are animals.
There's science projects,
man.

2704
02:35:38.410 --> 02:35:42.860
Those are not animals.
Real animals don't give a fuck about you.
They,
they,

2705
02:35:42.890 --> 02:35:47.200
they either indifferent to you or they're scared of you or they want to eat you.

2706
02:35:47.350 --> 02:35:52.090
That's real animals.
The relationship that you have with a dog.
It's like a child.

2707
02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:56.440
Like my dog is more like a child to me than he is like an animal.

2708
02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:01.240
I mean he's like my little friend that doesn't get to speak.
He doesn't talk.

2709
02:36:01.241 --> 02:36:02.074
But you know,

2710
02:36:02.680 --> 02:36:06.600
an animal in the wild is a competing organism.

2711
02:36:06.610 --> 02:36:11.050
They're competing amongst all the various organisms in whatever ecosystem

2712
02:36:11.051 --> 02:36:11.650
they're in.

2713
02:36:11.650 --> 02:36:15.070
And either they're at the top or if they're there or somewhere below that.

2714
02:36:15.250 --> 02:36:19.600
And that's just how it goes in every deer has looking around cause there's cats

2715
02:36:19.630 --> 02:36:23.140
and the cats are slowly sneaking up on them every fucking day of the week.

2716
02:36:23.530 --> 02:36:25.300
And if you go in a place where there's deer,

2717
02:36:25.301 --> 02:36:27.550
you best believe there's going to be mountain lions there.

2718
02:36:27.700 --> 02:36:31.990
Cause that's how it operates.
And when you see that in the Wa,
it's so rare.

2719
02:36:31.991 --> 02:36:34.540
It's so rare to be around that.
But when you see that in the wild,

2720
02:36:34.541 --> 02:36:37.330
then you get a deeper understanding of what it means to be an animal.

2721
02:36:37.740 --> 02:36:40.180
What's horrific is factory farming.

2722
02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:44.890
What's perverse and disgusting as the way animals are treated when these lives,

2723
02:36:45.010 --> 02:36:49.900
these livestock companies pump these animals and these warehouses and make them

2724
02:36:49.901 --> 02:36:54.490
stand in their own shit all day and then abused them and the horrific nature in

2725
02:36:54.491 --> 02:36:57.970
which their race.
Yeah,
all that should be illegal ag gag laws.

2726
02:36:57.971 --> 02:37:01.570
Those laws were whistle blowers get arrested.
Those should be illegal.

2727
02:37:01.571 --> 02:37:02.540
Those are immoral.

2728
02:37:02.660 --> 02:37:07.030
They're letting people know what goes into your food and those people are being

2729
02:37:07.031 --> 02:37:09.020
punished for that.
All that shit is crazy.

2730
02:37:09.110 --> 02:37:11.500
They're being punished because it hurts business.
Yes.

2731
02:37:11.530 --> 02:37:13.150
Well it should fucking hurt business.

2732
02:37:13.151 --> 02:37:18.110
You're doing something that we all think is a moral,
that's how I feel about it.

2733
02:37:18.111 --> 02:37:20.900
I don't think there's anything wrong with,
even if they,
if,

2734
02:37:20.930 --> 02:37:24.950
if there should be standards and how cows are raised,
how chickens are raised,

2735
02:37:25.130 --> 02:37:27.090
let them live like actual counts.

2736
02:37:27.091 --> 02:37:31.580
That's beautiful and there's a way that they can do that where people like Chris

2737
02:37:31.580 --> 02:37:34.460
Pratt.
Yeah,
from Guardian's got great guy.
He has,

2738
02:37:34.461 --> 02:37:39.461
he raises sheep and he eats them and he even gives them out to people.

2739
02:37:39.861 --> 02:37:43.730
He has butchers that take care of it,
these sheep or treated like,

2740
02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:44.930
like they're loved.

2741
02:37:44.930 --> 02:37:49.490
They're not scared of people and then literally they get walked into this room.

2742
02:37:49.491 --> 02:37:50.720
They have no idea what's going to happen.

2743
02:37:50.750 --> 02:37:53.720
A bolt gets put on the top of their head,
Bang and the lights go out.

2744
02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:57.950
Now you could say that should never happen and those sheep should just live

2745
02:37:57.951 --> 02:38:02.600
forever.
Okay.
You could,
I could understand that argument.
Or You could say,

2746
02:38:02.750 --> 02:38:06.860
boy,
if you're going to eat meat and you're going to eat the meat of an animal,

2747
02:38:06.861 --> 02:38:10.970
that you know how it lived and there was no horrific moments in its life.

2748
02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:13.940
It just one day the lights went out.
That seems like the best,

2749
02:38:14.180 --> 02:38:17.990
most ethical way to do it.
Maybe even perhaps more ethical than hunting.
Yes,

2750
02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:23.210
because when I'm hunting an animal,
um,
it's,
you know,
it's out there in,

2751
02:38:23.211 --> 02:38:26.630
this is crazy state where it's always looking to get eaten.

2752
02:38:26.631 --> 02:38:29.870
These sheep have no idea that can be eaten.
They think that everybody's there,

2753
02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:31.910
buddy,
and then one day they die.

2754
02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:35.380
<v 1>Yeah,
man,
I agree with that.
You know,
like yeah,
there's,</v>

2755
02:38:35.410 --> 02:38:40.160
it's difficult to bring ethics to that.
That's clearly in my view,

2756
02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:43.310
a matter of opinion.
Some people think that's okay.

2757
02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:45.920
<v 3>Say the,
they could turn it around on me and say,</v>

2758
02:38:45.921 --> 02:38:49.340
you could do that same like thought experience with people.
Like,

2759
02:38:49.341 --> 02:38:52.390
why don't you just see people like,
hey,
the personal lived a perfect life.

2760
02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:53.960
You put a bolt in the top of their head and bang,

2761
02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:56.150
shut the lights out and then they turn into barbecue.

2762
02:38:56.300 --> 02:38:58.880
<v 1>Look at,
yeah,
that's a very pronounced and vivid way.</v>

2763
02:38:58.881 --> 02:39:02.120
But I would say that in a sense we're all like we're being commodified,

2764
02:39:02.121 --> 02:39:03.450
imprisoned in clothes.

2765
02:39:03.451 --> 02:39:07.730
He made like the very fact that a law has been made to prevent people regulate

2766
02:39:07.731 --> 02:39:10.280
in or revealing the truth around that,
revealing it,

2767
02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:14.300
showing shows where the true bias of this system is in a way.

2768
02:39:14.301 --> 02:39:18.770
I think that one of the cultural jobs this podcast has performed,

2769
02:39:18.771 --> 02:39:23.720
and this is like whether deliberately or not is it demonstrates that the old

2770
02:39:23.810 --> 02:39:28.810
political lines that we used to comfortably abide within a star into sort of

2771
02:39:29.301 --> 02:39:34.301
break down cause you know like something like an obvious signifier of a

2772
02:39:34.431 --> 02:39:36.030
particular type of person.
I he,

2773
02:39:36.031 --> 02:39:41.031
I go hunting now we have to accept is coupled with your view that the

2774
02:39:41.270 --> 02:39:45.750
agricultural industry needs to be regulated and it's disgusting.
Now there,

2775
02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:46.371
you know,
they're,

2776
02:39:46.371 --> 02:39:51.371
we have complete and total agreement and we both can see that the way that

2777
02:39:51.441 --> 02:39:55.190
legislation is set up is biased towards corporate interest,

2778
02:39:55.191 --> 02:40:00.020
commercial interest and profit.
Yeah.
And so for me,
bloody whether or not,

2779
02:40:00.021 --> 02:40:02.870
you know,
Chris,
pat prive your own sheep I finger,
no problem man.

2780
02:40:02.871 --> 02:40:05.390
Woe what last night.
I don't need to spend my time worrying about that.

2781
02:40:05.391 --> 02:40:07.700
I'm a little bit like Alex Jones,
like with the,

2782
02:40:07.940 --> 02:40:11.750
why are we worrying about flat earth if they've got them babies and all of that

2783
02:40:11.751 --> 02:40:14.310
stuff besides like why we focus on the things

2784
02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:19.070
<v 0>that are making a genuine difference to the way people are living lives.
Yeah.</v>

2785
02:40:19.220 --> 02:40:19.380
Yeah.

2786
02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:23.700
And it seems to me that the one of the priorities is in a new global landscape

2787
02:40:23.701 --> 02:40:24.660
that we're living with.

2788
02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:28.740
What are the dominant forces and what are the goals of the dominant forces and

2789
02:40:28.741 --> 02:40:33.720
how detached at those goals from the lives of what you might say are ordinary

2790
02:40:33.721 --> 02:40:37.650
people,
the majority of people to use it less complex term.

2791
02:40:37.710 --> 02:40:41.760
And what's probably most horrific about reforming the system is that the people

2792
02:40:41.761 --> 02:40:44.280
that are going to suffer the most are the people that are the poorest.

2793
02:40:44.700 --> 02:40:47.850
So if you think of like a fast food in particular,
right?

2794
02:40:47.851 --> 02:40:51.540
There's a lot of like really poor people that rely on fast food because it's

2795
02:40:51.541 --> 02:40:52.410
very inexpensive.

2796
02:40:52.830 --> 02:40:57.000
If you go and you can get a lot of calories for a small amount of money,
right?

2797
02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:02.400
But if you go from the fast food restaurant and then you go down the line to

2798
02:41:02.401 --> 02:41:07.230
factory farming and then somehow know that they eliminate factory farming and

2799
02:41:07.231 --> 02:41:09.030
they say,
no,
no,
no.
If you're going to raise animals,

2800
02:41:09.031 --> 02:41:13.320
you have to have the same sort of standards that we would expect if we knew you

2801
02:41:13.321 --> 02:41:17.340
if we were there.
We want pastures,
we want animals living in the wild.
We want,

2802
02:41:17.341 --> 02:41:21.120
I mean,
you know,
fenced in,
but like living like an an actual animal,

2803
02:41:21.570 --> 02:41:24.150
not this crazy warehouse bullshit.
You guys are running well,

2804
02:41:24.151 --> 02:41:27.120
that's going to up our operation costs.
Well then that's how it's going to be.

2805
02:41:27.210 --> 02:41:29.670
So then the beef becomes far more expensive.

2806
02:41:29.940 --> 02:41:33.960
Now the beef becomes far more expensive than what a fast food.

2807
02:41:34.230 --> 02:41:35.340
What are the restaurants do?
Well,

2808
02:41:35.341 --> 02:41:37.020
they're going to have to make things more expensive too.

2809
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:40.890
So who's gonna suffer the poor people who's going to suffer with cheap meat and

2810
02:41:40.891 --> 02:41:44.310
supermarkets,
poor people that can't afford it now.
But I think that what happens,

2811
02:41:44.311 --> 02:41:45.290
Jvs,
you stopped to pee,

2812
02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:49.680
you have started to pull a Fred that reveals how the fabric of our culture is

2813
02:41:49.681 --> 02:41:52.410
corrupted because it shouldn't be more expensive.

2814
02:41:52.411 --> 02:41:55.950
The only reason it's more expensive is because everything is put into a capital

2815
02:41:55.951 --> 02:41:58.440
based ideology.
We're already,

2816
02:41:58.441 --> 02:42:02.040
I've heard many times on this show you discuss in universal basic income.

2817
02:42:02.190 --> 02:42:07.190
This is that the beginning of looking at alternative economic models and there's

2818
02:42:07.321 --> 02:42:11.490
an argument for saying everyone has the right to a nutritious diet.

2819
02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:14.310
Everyone has the right to a safe home.
You know?

2820
02:42:14.311 --> 02:42:18.540
So like if we start prioritizing those ideas above these organizations have the

2821
02:42:18.541 --> 02:42:20.810
right to maximize profit,
we were like,
we're homeless,

2822
02:42:20.820 --> 02:42:23.940
that they're maximizing profit that's getting taken off the table.

2823
02:42:23.941 --> 02:42:26.550
And then there comes your counterargument about innovation.
Well,

2824
02:42:26.551 --> 02:42:31.350
I would say if innovation slows no problem because we are,

2825
02:42:31.380 --> 02:42:35.490
we've decided as a culture to prioritize housing and nutrition for the majority

2826
02:42:35.491 --> 02:42:38.640
of people.
Now you can start say that starts to,
you know,
that's,

2827
02:42:38.730 --> 02:42:42.280
that's kind of socialism but,
and I don't think that that can work on a,

2828
02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:45.140
on a continental scale.
I think you have to,

2829
02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:47.670
we have to break down centralized systems,

2830
02:42:47.850 --> 02:42:51.690
whether those are corporate centralized systems or national.

2831
02:42:51.810 --> 02:42:56.010
I feel that the time has gone where there's too much diversity,

2832
02:42:56.100 --> 02:42:58.160
but like they're not too,
they're probably always was diversity.

2833
02:42:58.290 --> 02:43:01.080
People at different,
we're influenced by our culture is our schools,

2834
02:43:01.081 --> 02:43:03.420
our education,
our class,
our race.
There's all these factors.

2835
02:43:03.630 --> 02:43:07.350
And then to expect us all to live in this sort of single bandwidth of this is

2836
02:43:07.351 --> 02:43:09.990
what America is,
or this is what France or this is what England is,

2837
02:43:10.350 --> 02:43:11.980
people at these two different now.
But

2838
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:13.120
<v 1>what if it does?</v>

2839
02:43:13.180 --> 02:43:16.720
It seems like the standards we were adhering to unconsciously or otherwise,
he's,

2840
02:43:16.780 --> 02:43:21.160
these groups have the right to make as much money as they can and to interfere

2841
02:43:21.161 --> 02:43:24.910
with that is UNAMERICAN or on British or wherever it was,
you know,

2842
02:43:25.630 --> 02:43:28.360
beyond national ideas.
I'm sure.
So,
you know,

2843
02:43:28.361 --> 02:43:30.880
for me that's the way you pull that Fred.
Oh,

2844
02:43:30.881 --> 02:43:34.330
it's the poor that will suffer within.
No,
we have to rule out the poor suffer.

2845
02:43:34.331 --> 02:43:36.280
So we had,
so what happens in the end,

2846
02:43:36.490 --> 02:43:39.760
you start to get into redistribution of resources,

2847
02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:43.930
managing and regulate in the power of the most powerful people.

2848
02:43:43.931 --> 02:43:45.410
And whenever that conversation starts,

2849
02:43:45.411 --> 02:43:48.220
it gets shut down because we want to conserve.

2850
02:43:48.350 --> 02:43:50.000
<v 2>Even in a capitalist system.</v>

2851
02:43:50.030 --> 02:43:53.570
Wouldn't it be more ethical if everybody started from the same starting block?

2852
02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:55.430
Well that's what's wrong with the world,
right?

2853
02:43:55.431 --> 02:43:57.300
What's wrong with the world as some people are in a,

2854
02:43:58.060 --> 02:44:00.800
they have a terrible hand of cards.
You've been dealt,
you know,

2855
02:44:00.801 --> 02:44:04.660
and my point about food is that the people that are going to sue,

2856
02:44:04.850 --> 02:44:08.360
they're going to suffer the most,
are the people that rely on the cheap food.

2857
02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:10.820
Cheap food gets pulled away.

2858
02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:16.190
Then a lot of those supermarkets in a lot of those,

2859
02:44:16.191 --> 02:44:20.810
um,
fast food stores that rely on that factory farm food,
you know,

2860
02:44:20.811 --> 02:44:22.160
they're going to be in a bad situation.

2861
02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:26.100
Things are going to be much more expensive.
And if things are much more,
if they,

2862
02:44:26.110 --> 02:44:29.780
if they make animals live,
like,
um,
what does that guy's name?

2863
02:44:30.350 --> 02:44:34.850
Polyface farms.
Joel's Salitan.
Yeah,

2864
02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:36.350
he's a fascinating cat.

2865
02:44:36.350 --> 02:44:39.800
I had him on my podcast before he sort of a farm reformist.

2866
02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:43.430
And what he believes is that these animals should live just like animals.

2867
02:44:43.431 --> 02:44:47.120
When he has pigs,
he puts them in a fenced area,

2868
02:44:47.121 --> 02:44:49.340
but he moves the fence Daria every day.

2869
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:52.100
So like the pigs move to a different spot.

2870
02:44:52.130 --> 02:44:56.000
And so they're just constantly forging and eating acorns and uh,

2871
02:44:56.150 --> 02:44:59.750
but they're,
you know,
they're living like a pig.

2872
02:44:59.900 --> 02:45:04.090
They're living in a natural,
they're not living in some crazy warehouse.
Yes,

2873
02:45:04.091 --> 02:45:05.240
it does.
Same with his chickens.

2874
02:45:05.241 --> 02:45:08.300
He has this mobile chicken coop and he moves it from pasture to pasture.

2875
02:45:08.301 --> 02:45:10.580
And this is how he operates his entire farm?

2876
02:45:11.380 --> 02:45:14.230
<v 1>Yes.
It seems again the appointment it's been,</v>

2877
02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:18.130
we've talked about earlier that we ought to like if we look at that,

2878
02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:19.330
no one knows what's right.

2879
02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:24.480
So perhaps what we could try and do is replicate what we do naturally and so

2880
02:45:24.670 --> 02:45:27.040
there is an argument that naturally we do hunt.

2881
02:45:27.220 --> 02:45:29.590
There is a an argument that naturally we do eat meat.

2882
02:45:29.830 --> 02:45:32.230
There is an actually Grobe food too though.
Right?

2883
02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:35.190
<v 2>Judgmental.
I thought it was saying like getting into organic gardening.</v>

2884
02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:37.050
If you have your own garden man,

2885
02:45:37.051 --> 02:45:39.360
I mean that is like one of the most Karma free things ever.

2886
02:45:39.570 --> 02:45:41.700
If you could figure out a way to have your own compost,

2887
02:45:41.701 --> 02:45:45.840
your own garden and you don't ever have to rely on anybody else for your food,

2888
02:45:45.841 --> 02:45:47.130
well then you're not participated

2889
02:45:47.420 --> 02:45:48.171
<v 1>shit at all.</v>

2890
02:45:48.171 --> 02:45:52.610
Do you think that the spirit of entrepreneurship could be turned to designing

2891
02:45:52.611 --> 02:45:53.420
these systems?

2892
02:45:53.420 --> 02:45:57.680
Do you think the only thing that incentivizes people is maximum profit?
I do too.

2893
02:45:57.681 --> 02:45:59.940
I think the ease possible that people would sit around and go like,

2894
02:45:59.950 --> 02:46:04.670
how do we organize a society that is fair and just that doesn't kill people's

2895
02:46:04.671 --> 02:46:08.660
individualism or creativity or right to pursue different goals are to be who

2896
02:46:08.661 --> 02:46:10.100
they are.
Believe who you know.

2897
02:46:10.250 --> 02:46:12.560
But like I feel like there's so much fog in the air.

2898
02:46:12.561 --> 02:46:15.770
People don't know what they actually believe in because it's so much powerful

2899
02:46:15.771 --> 02:46:18.740
cultural influence,
so much toxin,
physical toxin,

2900
02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:23.240
literal toxins and toxicity,
cultural toxicity.
You know,
how are,

2901
02:46:23.450 --> 02:46:28.450
how am I to,
uh,
protect my children from cultural influences that telling them,

2902
02:46:28.460 --> 02:46:30.560
do you have to look this way,
be this way,
behave that way.

2903
02:46:30.561 --> 02:46:33.050
These are the things that call if you're not this,
you're not a man.

2904
02:46:33.050 --> 02:46:35.780
If you're not this,
you're not a woman.
You know,
like,
Whoa,
like,
you know,

2905
02:46:35.781 --> 02:46:36.501
as a parent,

2906
02:46:36.501 --> 02:46:40.160
I feel the obligation to create an environment where they can grow up to be who

2907
02:46:40.161 --> 02:46:41.600
they are in inverted commas.

2908
02:46:41.780 --> 02:46:44.700
And then when you sort of scowled it up to a society,
you know,

2909
02:46:44.780 --> 02:46:48.110
how can we start to recognize,

2910
02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:52.660
look is this time to look at different systems for living.
And I,

2911
02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:55.220
what I feel is people want to be involved in that,

2912
02:46:55.240 --> 02:46:57.110
in the power systems that affect them.

2913
02:46:57.280 --> 02:46:59.120
Like if you have a group of a hundred people,

2914
02:46:59.121 --> 02:47:03.050
they want a bit bout of run their own schools,
run their own care systems,

2915
02:47:03.051 --> 02:47:04.430
run it'd be in charge of their own life,

2916
02:47:04.431 --> 02:47:09.050
not just be some little beam of energy flicked about by cultural forces that

2917
02:47:09.051 --> 02:47:13.300
they can't reach or touch.
It's alienating and like one of the things he marks,

2918
02:47:13.301 --> 02:47:16.010
he's him and that you know,
and I know very little about this subject does,

2919
02:47:16.011 --> 02:47:20.930
he says that when capitalism reaches a certain point,
people will be glossed,

2920
02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:23.600
alienated.
They'll feel like a cog in a machine.

2921
02:47:23.690 --> 02:47:25.490
No one will have no pride in their work.

2922
02:47:25.491 --> 02:47:28.040
No one will know what it's like to make a whole bicycle and think,
look,

2923
02:47:28.041 --> 02:47:29.210
I made that.
You'll just,

2924
02:47:29.211 --> 02:47:32.960
you're the guy that makes the pedals now fuck off home now.
Like,
you know,

2925
02:47:32.961 --> 02:47:35.750
like I've listened to enough Jordan Peterson to understand that there are

2926
02:47:36.110 --> 02:47:39.470
limitations to what socialism and Marxism can achieve.

2927
02:47:39.471 --> 02:47:43.100
But just because you know,
capitalism is better than feudalism,

2928
02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:46.460
that doesn't mean that's the end of the conversation that we shouldn't be

2929
02:47:46.461 --> 02:47:48.890
looking for are more just ways of living.

2930
02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:51.531
<v 2>Um,
yeah.</v>

2931
02:47:51.531 --> 02:47:56.240
I don't know of capitalism as the problems or maybe it's how people engage with

2932
02:47:56.241 --> 02:47:59.120
capitalism.
Maybe it's what people choose to focus on.

2933
02:47:59.121 --> 02:48:03.320
If you're just about acquiring wealth and money,
some people are,
yeah,

2934
02:48:03.321 --> 02:48:06.740
they're going to be very deeply unhappy and it's going to be this weird game of

2935
02:48:06.741 --> 02:48:09.170
acquiring influence and power to,

2936
02:48:09.171 --> 02:48:13.610
you just have this insurmountable mound of money that you live on top of.
Right.

2937
02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:18.800
I don't think that's a good way for them either.
I think if we're gonna really,

2938
02:48:19.850 --> 02:48:21.920
we're going to look at this country fairly,

2939
02:48:22.190 --> 02:48:26.120
we have to look at think of all the poor neighborhoods and manage and being born

2940
02:48:26.121 --> 02:48:29.930
in those poor neighborhoods and imagine being born to place where there's no

2941
02:48:29.931 --> 02:48:34.160
resources.
There's no how you live in the fucking mountains of West Virginia.

2942
02:48:34.310 --> 02:48:39.310
Those coal mining communities or people or it's all just mobile homes and pills

2943
02:48:40.311 --> 02:48:42.860
and it's chaos,
but it just extreme poverty.

2944
02:48:43.070 --> 02:48:44.720
What do you do if you're stuck in there?
What have you,

2945
02:48:44.721 --> 02:48:48.620
if you're born to that clan,
that's the group you're born into,
you're fucked man.

2946
02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:49.513
You're fucked.

2947
02:48:49.550 --> 02:48:54.550
We have to take our resources and concentrate on parts of America the same way.

2948
02:48:55.731 --> 02:48:58.090
We concentrate on many other problems,

2949
02:48:58.091 --> 02:49:00.140
spots in the world and look at them as like,
hey man,

2950
02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:03.980
there's this spot where people are fucked.
We should unfucked them.

2951
02:49:04.170 --> 02:49:08.580
We should figure out a way to go into every single horrible

2952
02:49:08.580 --> 02:49:10.830
<v 3>community in this country,
on this planet,</v>

2953
02:49:11.130 --> 02:49:14.190
ones that are just as bad as some of that you see in third world countries.

2954
02:49:14.191 --> 02:49:18.090
They exist right here in America fixed that.
It's only ignore that.

2955
02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:20.460
That's crazy though.
If they're in Detroit,

2956
02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:22.680
if they're in wherever the fuck they are,
whatever,

2957
02:49:22.681 --> 02:49:24.090
whatever the horrible community is.

2958
02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:28.590
Why isn't there a concerted national effort to eliminate that?

2959
02:49:28.591 --> 02:49:31.860
That's a major source of crime.
It's a major source of pride.

2960
02:49:31.861 --> 02:49:34.410
People feel like they got fucked over in life,

2961
02:49:34.470 --> 02:49:38.640
so they want to get at you and take from you because you got that easy road.

2962
02:49:38.700 --> 02:49:40.920
Hey man,
you're born the fucking suburbs.
Hey Man,

2963
02:49:40.921 --> 02:49:43.190
your mom and dad are still together.
You know?
Hey Man,
your,

2964
02:49:43.191 --> 02:49:46.230
your dad has a job and your mom's at home baking and show you live like a

2965
02:49:46.231 --> 02:49:49.770
motherfucker,
Norman Rockwell movie.
Fuck you man.
My Mom's on crack.

2966
02:49:49.771 --> 02:49:53.130
My mom's a prostitute.
My life is hell.
My Dad beats me.

2967
02:49:53.131 --> 02:49:55.200
I've been sexually molested since I was a little kid.

2968
02:49:55.350 --> 02:49:58.230
This is the reality that people exist and they don't feel like anybody's coming

2969
02:49:58.231 --> 02:50:02.010
to help them.
We,
we need to concentrate on that.
If the government,

2970
02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:03.870
if the government really cares about us,

2971
02:50:03.871 --> 02:50:07.530
if they're really involved in social engineering and making America better
again,

2972
02:50:07.950 --> 02:50:11.910
make those places better.
Those are the places you need to concentrate on.

2973
02:50:11.911 --> 02:50:15.270
Not Tax breaks for fucking super rich corporations that get you in place.

2974
02:50:15.550 --> 02:50:18.180
Then they make enough money.
Man,
that's not the problem.

2975
02:50:18.300 --> 02:50:21.900
The money where the money goes,
what's it being allocated towards?

2976
02:50:22.170 --> 02:50:26.730
The biggest problem in our country is he's in impossible to escape communities.

2977
02:50:27.140 --> 02:50:30.750
It's so many people just get sucked into this trap and for every person that

2978
02:50:30.751 --> 02:50:35.280
gets out and becomes a basketball player or a successful businessperson and they

2979
02:50:35.281 --> 02:50:38.480
have this story about the poverty that they grew up and they,

2980
02:50:38.510 --> 02:50:43.350
they are so rare and it's not to be applauded that they got through that.

2981
02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:46.410
It is,
but it's more to be,
we should understand like,
hey,

2982
02:50:46.411 --> 02:50:49.860
we've got a real fucking problem that we're churning out all these people that

2983
02:50:49.861 --> 02:50:54.390
live with,
they start out in life with a massive deficits,
start out in life,

2984
02:50:54.391 --> 02:50:56.370
emotionally fucked,
physically abused.

2985
02:50:56.520 --> 02:51:00.570
They start out with everybody around them is a loser.
Everybody's going to jail.

2986
02:51:00.650 --> 02:51:05.190
Everybody is constantly doing pills or this or that.
The it's all negative.

2987
02:51:05.280 --> 02:51:10.280
And to ask them to develop their own positive mindset uniquely in a vacuum,

2988
02:51:10.950 --> 02:51:14.010
it's preposterous.
It's all these pull them up by your bootstraps.

2989
02:51:14.670 --> 02:51:17.520
All those assholes,
hey,
you got to pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

2990
02:51:17.521 --> 02:51:20.010
Like they don't even have boots,
man.
You don't understand.

2991
02:51:20.040 --> 02:51:22.170
Like you don't know what you're talking about.
You,
you've never seen it,

2992
02:51:22.171 --> 02:51:25.080
you've never been involved in that kind of poverty.
It's not fair.

2993
02:51:25.290 --> 02:51:26.120
It's not fair at all.

2994
02:51:26.120 --> 02:51:29.510
If we care about people that's we should fucking care about.
Yes,

2995
02:51:29.550 --> 02:51:31.620
I couldn't agree more.
That's the number one problem.

2996
02:51:31.650 --> 02:51:35.360
And it's everywhere in the world.
All the,
all the crime and poverty.
Well,

2997
02:51:35.380 --> 02:51:38.910
imagine if everyone the lowest you could live,

2998
02:51:38.911 --> 02:51:41.850
it's like a middle class existence.
Yes.
Boy,

2999
02:51:42.240 --> 02:51:47.240
everybody would all be a lot more fucking relaxed if you always had meals,

3000
02:51:47.580 --> 02:51:49.860
you always had food.
You always had a roof over your head.

3001
02:51:49.890 --> 02:51:51.660
Everyone lives Middleclass Holy Shit.

3002
02:51:51.900 --> 02:51:55.620
I mean obviously that's way past the expectations that we have right now for the

3003
02:51:55.621 --> 02:52:00.621
world because like $34,000 a year globally puts you in the world 1% you know?

3004
02:52:01.690 --> 02:52:06.040
I mean that's the w if you make $34,000 a year,
which is to live on,
man,

3005
02:52:06.230 --> 02:52:08.020
<v 0>did you?
You're in the 1% of the world.</v>

3006
02:52:08.640 --> 02:52:13.640
But that stand it that you've very eloquently described is I think achievable

3007
02:52:16.420 --> 02:52:17.770
and that won't be the aim.

3008
02:52:18.010 --> 02:52:22.780
And when you give just one example of how legislate the bias of legislation is

3009
02:52:22.781 --> 02:52:27.760
continually to support the powerful while making the just making nominal

3010
02:52:27.761 --> 02:52:32.560
gestures to poverty.
Yeah.
I'm a little gestures like where you put that.

3011
02:52:32.590 --> 02:52:37.210
Yeah and that's the the the,
if there is a point in nation,

3012
02:52:37.211 --> 02:52:41.170
if there is a point to a flag in our belief and this idea that there is an

3013
02:52:41.171 --> 02:52:44.170
America and there is a Britain and we're all together and we're all one and

3014
02:52:44.171 --> 02:52:47.440
we've got a common destiny in a common past,
then if we're not,

3015
02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:50.890
if we're ignoring and neglecting those communities then I say that is what

3016
02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:56.020
defines us.
You know,
and until there are systems codes,

3017
02:52:56.050 --> 02:53:01.050
regulations that prioritize that we will continue to live in something heading

3018
02:53:01.061 --> 02:53:02.440
to what if not a dystopia.

3019
02:53:02.460 --> 02:53:07.460
I think moving in the direction of dystopia where the priorities and a dreams

3020
02:53:07.631 --> 02:53:12.631
are sort of owned really by the kind of a bit mad evil insect robot images that

3021
02:53:13.691 --> 02:53:17.320
we've seen discussed that people do get very concerned when someone reaches a

3022
02:53:17.321 --> 02:53:21.460
point of excessive power and influence like a Jeff Bezos type character.

3023
02:53:21.790 --> 02:53:26.340
When you see some guy who not,
he doesn't have $1 million,
like wow,

3024
02:53:26.350 --> 02:53:30.280
guys got $1 million.
Like he must be so relaxed so that so much money.

3025
02:53:30.460 --> 02:53:35.460
Now he's got 150 billion and he works every day maniacally and he's constantly

3026
02:53:36.821 --> 02:53:40.060
doing new projects and new things and buying out whole foods.

3027
02:53:40.061 --> 02:53:44.290
And that's like pinnacle capitalism is one of the things that scares people the

3028
02:53:44.291 --> 02:53:45.930
most when someone just acquire,

3029
02:53:45.931 --> 02:53:49.510
it's just insane position of power and wealth.

3030
02:53:49.660 --> 02:53:54.520
Like like a Bill Gates type character who is very altruistic,
very,

3031
02:53:54.521 --> 02:53:57.090
very generous.
Bill Gates,
accuser,

3032
02:53:57.100 --> 02:54:00.340
one of the better examples of someone who gains a lot of money and then it does

3033
02:54:00.430 --> 02:54:03.700
a lot to help people,
especially in his retirement.
All,

3034
02:54:03.701 --> 02:54:07.240
all they do is focus on charitable organizations and yeah,
which is brilliant,

3035
02:54:08.500 --> 02:54:09.660
marvelous.
And you know,

3036
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:12.400
I'm not criticizing the great achievements of brilliant people,

3037
02:54:12.401 --> 02:54:15.090
but like it really for me that demonstrates their limb.

3038
02:54:15.130 --> 02:54:19.210
The limitations come from the type of system as we live in that you can't

3039
02:54:19.211 --> 02:54:23.890
through charity effect every impoverished community in America.
You know,

3040
02:54:23.891 --> 02:54:27.550
like we,
the systems that we have are,
are,
well,
if you're poor like that,
you know,

3041
02:54:27.551 --> 02:54:29.740
the bootstrap model,
well this guy did it.

3042
02:54:29.741 --> 02:54:33.010
Look at this great guy who overcame the odds,
you know,
until like,

3043
02:54:33.040 --> 02:54:37.420
I feel like in a sense charity is become a kind of valve that allows that,

3044
02:54:37.421 --> 02:54:41.020
you know,
people like you and I who aren't poor to feel like,

3045
02:54:41.021 --> 02:54:43.780
well I'd do a bit in,
Oh,
I'm sort of involved.

3046
02:54:43.781 --> 02:54:48.700
I can wash my hands of it when you know what these,
unless we,

3047
02:54:49.810 --> 02:54:51.730
there is no America,
there is no England.

3048
02:54:51.731 --> 02:54:55.180
Unless we have integral relationships with one another,
we support one another.

3049
02:54:56.550 --> 02:54:59.800
If we really are on a team,
when we see someone who's completely downtrodden,

3050
02:54:59.801 --> 02:55:04.160
who's on our team and we ignore them,
well that's not much of a fucking,
is it?
No.

3051
02:55:04.210 --> 02:55:06.620
<v 2>I mean that's what I feel like when it come to red lights and I see homeless</v>

3052
02:55:06.621 --> 02:55:11.540
people,
I feel terrible.
I'm like,
I feel like,
you know,
I mean there's,

3053
02:55:11.541 --> 02:55:13.820
part of me is like don't give him any money because they know they're going to

3054
02:55:13.821 --> 02:55:16.340
just buy drugs.
You know?
Let them figure it out,

3055
02:55:16.341 --> 02:55:17.570
but then they're not going to figure it out.

3056
02:55:17.750 --> 02:55:21.680
They have mental health issues and they're supposedly on the team.

3057
02:55:21.860 --> 02:55:25.670
They probably were born in America.
They probably have national citizenship here.

3058
02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:27.073
You know,
they,

3059
02:55:27.110 --> 02:55:29.870
this is our team and no one gives a fuck that they're camped out under the

3060
02:55:29.871 --> 02:55:31.660
bridge.
It's like the,

3061
02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:35.120
the diffusion of responsibility that comes with these massive numbers,

3062
02:55:35.270 --> 02:55:38.810
20 million in La,
300 and plus whatever it is now.

3063
02:55:38.811 --> 02:55:40.580
What is it like three 20 in American?

3064
02:55:40.790 --> 02:55:44.730
<v 1>Yeah.
It's unbelievable.
I think there's 90,000 in the General California.</v>

3065
02:55:44.780 --> 02:55:47.750
Look at cities worth of homeless people isn't,

3066
02:55:47.751 --> 02:55:49.850
it is not difficult for me to envisage.

3067
02:55:49.851 --> 02:55:53.720
Like when we talk about the transcendent states that can be achieved through

3068
02:55:53.721 --> 02:55:57.440
meditation and Psychedelics,
meaning that beings like us can access them.

3069
02:55:57.650 --> 02:56:01.940
It's not difficult to envisage human,
like a type of creature type of being.

3070
02:56:01.941 --> 02:56:05.240
A little more evolved in us that we'd look back and say,
oh my God,

3071
02:56:05.270 --> 02:56:06.530
they allowed homelessness.

3072
02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:10.460
They allowed those impoverished communities or why was it I have this belief in

3073
02:56:10.461 --> 02:56:14.960
competitive systems and survival of the fittest that we're resourced from ideas

3074
02:56:15.050 --> 02:56:17.240
that weren't really meant to be translated into that.

3075
02:56:17.450 --> 02:56:20.180
When you were talking before about by the natural world is fraught with

3076
02:56:20.181 --> 02:56:22.850
competition and Fred of course,
is that these animals,
so you know,

3077
02:56:22.851 --> 02:56:24.140
I'm not disputing what you're saying there,

3078
02:56:24.290 --> 02:56:27.340
but we can't transpose onto an economic system,
survival of the fittest.

3079
02:56:27.350 --> 02:56:29.270
If you ain't got enough hustle and muscle,
fuck you.

3080
02:56:29.271 --> 02:56:31.240
You have to do a down by the wayside.
You know?

3081
02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:35.360
Here we have an obligation to aspire to the better parts of our nature.

3082
02:56:35.510 --> 02:56:39.860
Not to continually use materialism and rationalism to justify that 20% of the

3083
02:56:39.861 --> 02:56:41.480
population,
you know,
or whatever it was,

3084
02:56:41.481 --> 02:56:45.410
energy is adjust garbage or just waste and there,
that's affordable.
We can occur,

3085
02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:49.370
we can live with that.
For me it's that,
why would we,

3086
02:56:49.371 --> 02:56:52.460
once we have the knowledge that,
oh yeah,
we shouldn't be farming in that way.
Oh,

3087
02:56:52.461 --> 02:56:53.960
we shouldn't have social systems.
All of the,

3088
02:56:53.961 --> 02:56:57.290
the answer's always the same because if you were to change in that area,

3089
02:56:57.380 --> 02:57:00.140
it will affect the interest of the powerful,
it will affect,

3090
02:57:00.141 --> 02:57:03.540
impede the ability of certain organizations to make profit.
Now I'm,
yeah,

3091
02:57:03.590 --> 02:57:04.900
I'm not talking about,
you know,

3092
02:57:04.910 --> 02:57:09.350
I don't know the lexicon enough around socialism and capitalism and Marxism and

3093
02:57:09.590 --> 02:57:11.360
various forms of social organization.

3094
02:57:11.510 --> 02:57:15.320
I'm just talking about my assumption that we're all resorbed from the same basic

3095
02:57:15.350 --> 02:57:17.320
material and phenomenal.

3096
02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:21.380
We all have compassion and love in us and if we on an individual level can

3097
02:57:21.381 --> 02:57:23.030
achieve some level of access to that,

3098
02:57:23.180 --> 02:57:27.350
then we can start to organize ourselves on that basis,
not on the basis of,
well,

3099
02:57:27.351 --> 02:57:30.580
what's the most I can get as an individual?
It's rational for me to read.

3100
02:57:30.590 --> 02:57:33.940
I'm not involved in that.
That doesn't affect me personally,
you know,

3101
02:57:33.970 --> 02:57:35.690
and I think it's a hard thing for us to hold.

3102
02:57:35.691 --> 02:57:39.320
I think the reason we all do just live with homelessness and the only decision

3103
02:57:39.321 --> 02:57:42.920
we make is do we put a couple of dollars out the window at the light or not?

3104
02:57:43.190 --> 02:57:47.070
Then like big,
it's hard to hold that.
It's hard to love more than a hundred feet.

3105
02:57:47.071 --> 02:57:47.350
Yeah.

3106
02:57:47.350 --> 02:57:51.130
<v 2>There's no fix.
Like there's no as an individual,</v>

3107
02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:56.280
but not one person and even collectively as a group when you have mental health

3108
02:57:56.351 --> 02:58:01.350
issues,
unless you want to institutionalize those people.
Yeah,
but then who,

3109
02:58:01.410 --> 02:58:02.243
here's the thing,

3110
02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:03.990
<v 0>right?
If everyone has a unique,</v>

3111
02:58:04.410 --> 02:58:09.270
and if everyone has their own ideas about what to do with their life and

3112
02:58:09.271 --> 02:58:10.110
everyone has freedom,

3113
02:58:10.260 --> 02:58:12.450
what if you just don't have enough people that are interested in,

3114
02:58:12.750 --> 02:58:15.750
in mental health of the homeless people?
He just don't have enough.

3115
02:58:15.751 --> 02:58:18.420
There's no resources.
Guarantee results.
Yeah.

3116
02:58:18.421 --> 02:58:21.370
That's a big question because our systems are biased in a particular direction.

3117
02:58:21.780 --> 02:58:25.920
If they have government funding,
do you think that that could cure homelessness?

3118
02:58:25.950 --> 02:58:28.860
One of the advantages I've got of being a drug addict is it means I have to help

3119
02:58:28.861 --> 02:58:32.640
have a traffic ad ex is part of my own recovery.
This puts me into areas,

3120
02:58:32.641 --> 02:58:33.630
institutions,
groups,

3121
02:58:33.631 --> 02:58:36.770
facilities where our meat and drug addicts and always what you'll find that

3122
02:58:36.771 --> 02:58:39.260
people that work there,
there's always someone like a man or a woman.

3123
02:58:39.270 --> 02:58:41.100
Most often in my personal experiences as a woman,

3124
02:58:41.101 --> 02:58:46.050
some matriarchal woman full of mother energy that just will do this shit forever

3125
02:58:46.110 --> 02:58:48.120
for free,
for nothing that just loves it.

3126
02:58:48.120 --> 02:58:52.410
There's just put herself like my grandmother did or my mother did or like these

3127
02:58:52.411 --> 02:58:55.920
women do between people in the gutter that are just willing to say,

3128
02:58:55.950 --> 02:58:59.070
I'll be the person,
I'll be the person in la at friendly house.

3129
02:58:59.071 --> 02:59:01.660
It was a woman called Peggy Albrecht but it used to run a play a friend in

3130
02:59:01.661 --> 02:59:05.220
houses have for women that have got drug and addiction and abuse issues and like

3131
02:59:05.221 --> 02:59:06.870
this woman,
she was from Chicago,

3132
02:59:06.871 --> 02:59:10.300
she was nine years old by the time like I'm actually,

3133
02:59:10.301 --> 02:59:15.150
I'm so rude and brilliant and beautiful and entirely willing to dedicate herself

3134
02:59:15.151 --> 02:59:16.980
and I think every community everywhere,

3135
02:59:17.100 --> 02:59:20.640
everyone knows people like that and I feel like the same way as like if it is

3136
02:59:20.641 --> 02:59:23.430
someone that has got great capacity or play basketball or be a comic,

3137
02:59:23.610 --> 02:59:28.330
like I think that when you spot those people that you encourage them and help

3138
02:59:28.340 --> 02:59:31.350
them.
Yeah,
the talent of compassion and love that.

3139
02:59:31.410 --> 02:59:33.120
But we don't value that unless it's like,

3140
02:59:33.121 --> 02:59:34.530
unless it could be turned to a profit fuck off.

3141
02:59:34.620 --> 02:59:36.540
All of those organizations like those,
uh,

3142
02:59:36.960 --> 02:59:39.420
organizations that help people with addiction issues,
you know,

3143
02:59:40.020 --> 02:59:44.460
they are maligned and like the people that profit from the opioid crisis,

3144
02:59:44.490 --> 02:59:45.450
they are supported,

3145
02:59:45.451 --> 02:59:48.600
they are able to conceal as John Oliver Brilliantly revealed that they,

3146
02:59:48.610 --> 02:59:51.240
they're able to conceal their practices continually.

3147
02:59:51.241 --> 02:59:56.241
The invisible biases in the direction of profit and like the failure of certain

3148
02:59:57.001 --> 02:59:59.340
types of socialism doesn't mean that's the end of the argument.

3149
02:59:59.341 --> 03:00:03.760
I think we have an obligation to look for ways of accessing our own,
uh,

3150
03:00:04.200 --> 03:00:06.450
higher nature,
better nature kind of nature.

3151
03:00:06.451 --> 03:00:10.050
Call it what you will and seeing how we can organize that.
I as an individual,

3152
03:00:10.051 --> 03:00:13.440
you can do so much.
I mean,
if,
if Bill Gates can,
you know,
fucking no,

3153
03:00:13.441 --> 03:00:17.730
I had no cure malaria and make the significant charitable Dana,
these impressive,

3154
03:00:17.731 --> 03:00:20.550
powerful people can't make a meaningful difference,

3155
03:00:20.580 --> 03:00:23.250
then clearly this is a systemic problem.
Well,

3156
03:00:23.251 --> 03:00:26.510
there's also the problem with homeless people and that they're adults.
Um,

3157
03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:29.970
when you become an adult and you develop from the time you were a child,

3158
03:00:29.971 --> 03:00:33.840
it's probably very likely that the damage was all done while they were young.

3159
03:00:34.110 --> 03:00:36.360
They were probably abused and neglected,

3160
03:00:36.361 --> 03:00:40.470
and there's a lot of issues that led them to either have mental health problems

3161
03:00:40.471 --> 03:00:43.740
or they had mental health problems or ready maybe their genetic problems.

3162
03:00:43.741 --> 03:00:44.461
Then on top of that,

3163
03:00:44.461 --> 03:00:48.870
there's drug abuse to you for each one of those people to get well,

3164
03:00:49.140 --> 03:00:51.100
you're going to need a massive amount of folks.

3165
03:00:51.101 --> 03:00:54.660
You're not going to have one old lady who's rude.
Brilliant.

3166
03:00:55.050 --> 03:00:59.070
That's a cute movie.
Never.
That's 20 people.
Yeah.
It's a good movie.

3167
03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:00.100
Quite shut down.
Write

3168
03:01:00.100 --> 03:01:03.100
<v 3>it down.
Who would,
who would be the woman</v>

3169
03:01:04.660 --> 03:01:08.700
Faye Dunaway or some shit like the one that was,
uh,
out of golden girls,

3170
03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:11.910
Estelle Getty.
She's still available.
Oh,
God.

3171
03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:14.770
Wrapped pretty white store around Betty White.
Still hanging in there.
Yeah,

3172
03:01:14.771 --> 03:01:16.900
but would you book a movie around her stink.
Hang on.

3173
03:01:19.450 --> 03:01:22.840
How are we going to fund this?
Yeah,
it's,
um,
yeah,
you're right.

3174
03:01:22.841 --> 03:01:24.100
Look there's limitation to the individual,

3175
03:01:24.101 --> 03:01:27.340
but there's not like crushed his optimism in the crib.
Now Joe,

3176
03:01:27.341 --> 03:01:30.370
because I know that trashing the optimism,

3177
03:01:30.610 --> 03:01:35.020
but I'm saying the logistics of it would almost be insurmountable and it's very

3178
03:01:35.021 --> 03:01:37.990
hard to,
it is not an objective thing.

3179
03:01:38.050 --> 03:01:40.150
It's this thing that's been biased over time.

3180
03:01:40.240 --> 03:01:44.650
Sort of once a person has developed once they're assuming it's very difficult to

3181
03:01:44.651 --> 03:01:46.930
turn that train around.
Yeah.
If we can,
you know,

3182
03:01:46.931 --> 03:01:50.950
saves the community and Save the future,

3183
03:01:51.220 --> 03:01:55.930
like help like less people get through fucked help,

3184
03:01:55.931 --> 03:02:00.700
let help more people get through with hope and with a real possibility for

3185
03:02:00.730 --> 03:02:05.500
improving their life versus have this sense of hopelessness that many are

3186
03:02:05.501 --> 03:02:10.410
confronted with that's going to make less crime.
I agree.
That's just,
if they,

3187
03:02:10.530 --> 03:02:13.290
if someone looked at it from a social engineering stand point,

3188
03:02:13.291 --> 03:02:14.130
I'd almost seems like they will.

3189
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:17.440
The only way that would ever have to happen would be there's be some fucking

3190
03:02:17.441 --> 03:02:21.640
catastrophe that force people to act like we sometimes need something that's

3191
03:02:21.641 --> 03:02:24.040
shoved in our face to force us to act,

3192
03:02:24.041 --> 03:02:29.041
but if someone brilliantly calculated the amount of resources that it would

3193
03:02:29.141 --> 03:02:32.980
require and then also brilliantly calculated how much less crime it would have,

3194
03:02:33.190 --> 03:02:38.080
how much less,
how many more innovations because people didn't waste their lives.

3195
03:02:38.081 --> 03:02:38.621
In fact,

3196
03:02:38.621 --> 03:02:42.880
they got through life and used one of the most valuable resources we have,

3197
03:02:42.881 --> 03:02:46.130
which is the human imagination and creativity and ingenuity like,

3198
03:02:46.300 --> 03:02:49.960
and we're missing that on these people that are growing up in these horrible

3199
03:02:49.961 --> 03:02:52.890
environments where they can't escape.
They're so fuck from,

3200
03:02:52.910 --> 03:02:56.530
they're in gangs there,
you know the crime and poverty and violence,

3201
03:02:56.531 --> 03:03:01.531
there's so fucked that whatever genius they have is wasted on this nonsensical

3202
03:03:02.021 --> 03:03:06.340
existence.
If they could just show that and quantify how much that would be,

3203
03:03:06.341 --> 03:03:11.341
how valuable that would be to the overall culture and community of the co of the

3204
03:03:11.351 --> 03:03:13.420
continent and then ultimately of the earth.

3205
03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:17.470
I mean you would have a reason to engineer think about this.
Beautiful.

3206
03:03:17.471 --> 03:03:21.520
That is really beautiful and it's interesting that the way that I agree with you

3207
03:03:21.521 --> 03:03:26.500
that it almost has to at some point be translated into monetary value because

3208
03:03:26.501 --> 03:03:31.150
otherwise people don't seem to read it.
Yeah,
and safety for everybody,

3209
03:03:31.151 --> 03:03:34.660
for them who live in these horrible communities wouldn't be great.
Again,

3210
03:03:34.661 --> 03:03:36.700
if everybody lived like a middle class person,

3211
03:03:37.150 --> 03:03:40.870
the idea that that's impossible seems so insane.
It's almost seems like,

3212
03:03:40.871 --> 03:03:42.370
well then nobody should live like that.

3213
03:03:42.371 --> 03:03:45.310
Then like either everybody should be able to live like that or nobody should

3214
03:03:45.311 --> 03:03:48.430
build the boy.
That was like,
that's what everybody really wants,
right?

3215
03:03:48.430 --> 03:03:53.410
You want to be comfortable like in terms of like your ability to exist and then

3216
03:03:53.650 --> 03:03:58.650
all the things you're doing that you struggle with should be a good percentage

3217
03:03:58.911 --> 03:04:01.610
of them other than emotional and friendship type thing should be of your own

3218
03:04:01.611 --> 03:04:05.120
choosing.
You choose to take a difficult path.

3219
03:04:05.150 --> 03:04:06.980
You choose to take an adventure.

3220
03:04:07.220 --> 03:04:11.870
You choose to try to enrich yourself with this difficult experience and the

3221
03:04:11.871 --> 03:04:15.350
challenge of it and try to overcome that challenge instead of you.

3222
03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:18.770
Your challenge is not to get killed by a gang.
You know,
your,

3223
03:04:18.771 --> 03:04:22.040
your challenge is not get fucked by your uncle again.
You know what I mean?

3224
03:04:22.041 --> 03:04:24.320
I mean,
this is what people have to deal with and you're,

3225
03:04:24.321 --> 03:04:27.110
you're missing these brilliant minds.

3226
03:04:27.111 --> 03:04:29.310
They don't get this chance to come through and,

3227
03:04:29.500 --> 03:04:33.640
and sneak through that fucking salmon ladder.
You know,
get up to that

3228
03:04:33.730 --> 03:04:38.590
<v 1>top.
This would be a very,
uh,
beautiful that you are passionate about this.</v>

3229
03:04:38.650 --> 03:04:43.650
And I think popularizing these ideas is important because I feel that then

3230
03:04:44.561 --> 03:04:48.730
people will be familiar with this kind of language and we'll recognize that when

3231
03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:50.890
there is a political discourse.

3232
03:04:50.891 --> 03:04:55.510
How phatic an empty is that people will say,
you know,

3233
03:04:55.511 --> 03:04:57.970
like I think in the last election in your country,

3234
03:04:58.150 --> 03:05:01.390
it was clear that there was no one,

3235
03:05:01.450 --> 03:05:05.440
no one is saying that no one,
no one is standing on a political platform of,

3236
03:05:05.520 --> 03:05:07.900
do you know what everyone should basically be,
I live a middle class.

3237
03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:10.990
Lifestyle is no reason.
There's enough resources.
We can do this.

3238
03:05:10.991 --> 03:05:15.991
We could organize society on that basis because that's considered outlandish and

3239
03:05:16.271 --> 03:05:19.330
crazy and we're so,
there's so much I can again,
you know,

3240
03:05:19.331 --> 03:05:21.790
with your imaginary listener,

3241
03:05:21.791 --> 03:05:24.950
the listener that would consider this pontification,
you know,

3242
03:05:24.970 --> 03:05:26.590
there's so much anger I can,

3243
03:05:26.890 --> 03:05:29.860
I feel that a lot of political events that have occurred in the last five years

3244
03:05:29.890 --> 03:05:34.810
are the manifestation of a social rage of people that are pissed off with not

3245
03:05:34.811 --> 03:05:39.310
being heard.
A pissed off with a cultural conversation that didn't include them,

3246
03:05:39.580 --> 03:05:43.270
uh,
and that they feel angry and I don't want to help other people.
Fuck knows.

3247
03:05:43.271 --> 03:05:43.630
But you know,

3248
03:05:43.630 --> 03:05:48.310
that that resource is becoming sort of nurtured and grown.

3249
03:05:48.550 --> 03:05:52.180
And I feel people would feel tremendous relief to let go of that.

3250
03:05:52.240 --> 03:05:55.390
You have to feel like this and it's all right for you to be you.

3251
03:05:56.230 --> 03:05:58.920
Could we be a little more aspirational and a,

3252
03:05:58.921 --> 03:06:01.480
a little and consider what our goals are.

3253
03:06:01.630 --> 03:06:05.170
Consider what progress looks like to us is progress.

3254
03:06:05.200 --> 03:06:10.200
The terrifying robots or his progress considering elevate in the lowest among us

3255
03:06:10.810 --> 03:06:12.040
to raise the Stan.

3256
03:06:12.200 --> 03:06:16.190
<v 3>If people could just understand that this,
this is not forever.
You don't,</v>

3257
03:06:16.191 --> 03:06:19.490
there is no such thing as forever.
This is a temporary thing.
It,

3258
03:06:19.510 --> 03:06:24.510
you've gotta try to Eke as much good out of this as you can and to go against my

3259
03:06:24.801 --> 03:06:28.970
point.
You know,
there's a real problem with people being lazy.
People are lazy.

3260
03:06:28.971 --> 03:06:33.200
There's not an equality of effort.
The idea of the quality of outcome,

3261
03:06:33.350 --> 03:06:36.980
like people want,
you know,
income equality.
Well,
there's no effort.
Equality,

3262
03:06:37.520 --> 03:06:40.670
that's just the fact.
There's people out there that are just,
they work harder,

3263
03:06:40.700 --> 03:06:44.000
they're smarter,
they're more focused,
they are less distracted.

3264
03:06:44.120 --> 03:06:46.100
The more dedicated they have a better plan,

3265
03:06:46.220 --> 03:06:48.500
they've thought it through better and they become more successful.

3266
03:06:48.650 --> 03:06:52.610
And the idea that they become more successful than you because somehow or

3267
03:06:52.611 --> 03:06:56.050
another there's some nefarious actions of foot.
Well that that

3268
03:06:56.280 --> 03:07:00.690
<v 0>negates another possibility,
which is you're lazy cunt.
That's a possibility.
Yes.</v>

3269
03:07:00.840 --> 03:07:02.880
And what do we do about those people?
I tell you this,

3270
03:07:02.881 --> 03:07:07.250
I've got a plan for the Lazy Lazy Island.
You're all going to laser.

3271
03:07:07.260 --> 03:07:11.580
It's a bit like Pinocchio's donkey land.
No Arcade Games though.
They're too lazy.

3272
03:07:11.790 --> 03:07:12.720
I feel like I'm,

3273
03:07:12.930 --> 03:07:17.760
well I consider this that people that don't have a lot of life force,

3274
03:07:17.820 --> 03:07:22.590
like I feel like it's a gift to be a person that's got a lot of drive to be a

3275
03:07:22.591 --> 03:07:24.930
person that's like,
I'm fucking going to achieve this shit.
You know,

3276
03:07:24.940 --> 03:07:27.810
like there's some people that are the little lethargic and don't have a lot of

3277
03:07:27.811 --> 03:07:29.850
energy.
I feel that's a kind of despondency.

3278
03:07:29.851 --> 03:07:32.700
We could break that down in a thousand different ways.
Is it poor diet?

3279
03:07:32.880 --> 03:07:36.590
Is it poor role models?
Is it poor social conditioning?
Who are these lazy people?

3280
03:07:36.780 --> 03:07:39.410
Genius could be weak genes to even weak genes.

3281
03:07:39.720 --> 03:07:43.260
Then we'd like in the territory of disability so it however you look at it,

3282
03:07:43.261 --> 03:07:46.350
I think you end up at a point of compassion.
I think.

3283
03:07:46.830 --> 03:07:50.550
I think we should start at the point of compassion cause other or like what is

3284
03:07:50.551 --> 03:07:55.410
tolerance if it isn't the tolerance of people that we sort of can't understand.

3285
03:07:55.590 --> 03:07:59.130
As long as they carry their own weight,
we usually don't have a problem with it.

3286
03:07:59.400 --> 03:08:01.140
But when they're so lazy,

3287
03:08:01.141 --> 03:08:06.141
they just Juke the system and screw people over and figure their way to scam

3288
03:08:07.111 --> 03:08:07.944
through life.

3289
03:08:08.250 --> 03:08:11.790
But I think those people don't exist only at the bottom of the social ladder.

3290
03:08:11.791 --> 03:08:13.620
I think they exist at the top.

3291
03:08:13.650 --> 03:08:16.410
And the effect there is worse [inaudible] about the president of United States

3292
03:08:16.850 --> 03:08:18.320
because this is my country.
Motherfucker.

3293
03:08:18.330 --> 03:08:23.190
You better be actually met your president and I do found him to be delightful.

3294
03:08:23.300 --> 03:08:26.290
Yeah,
that's the sort of figures.
So very sort of sweet.
Again,
like I say,

3295
03:08:26.291 --> 03:08:29.610
I don't judge them either.
One there,
I interviewed him about five years ago.

3296
03:08:29.611 --> 03:08:32.280
I was doing we suppose for,
he was the provost.
The president was okay,

3297
03:08:32.370 --> 03:08:36.270
let me near him.
He's present.
I went back over the fence,

3298
03:08:36.880 --> 03:08:41.100
all that alone.
The Wall.
I like it.
Like he,
um,
yeah,
he was sort of sweep.

3299
03:08:41.101 --> 03:08:42.030
I remember thinking,

3300
03:08:42.031 --> 03:08:46.980
well I felt was why you don't have no intellectual curiosity.
That's what I felt.

3301
03:08:47.010 --> 03:08:49.560
Well,
that's what I felt.
I felt like I was some sort of liked him.

3302
03:08:49.561 --> 03:08:52.860
He was nice and the staff at that big tower,
they all loved him,

3303
03:08:53.100 --> 03:08:56.970
but curiosity and I don't think he's been very genuine with that.
Great.

3304
03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.670
Make America great again for you.
I don't lie.
Where's that?

3305
03:08:59.730 --> 03:09:02.400
Everyone should be middle class.
We're going to start reorganizing society,

3306
03:09:02.401 --> 03:09:05.400
reaching out into Detroit and in a crush mining towns in West Virginia.

3307
03:09:05.640 --> 03:09:08.220
Where's that?
Other than the wise,
you ain't making America great again.

3308
03:09:08.250 --> 03:09:09.360
That's true.
That's true.

3309
03:09:09.480 --> 03:09:11.610
But think about how we were talking about Dave Chappelle,

3310
03:09:11.611 --> 03:09:15.180
but one of the reasons why he's so great other than the fact that he's smart,

3311
03:09:15.720 --> 03:09:20.580
just touting all these good things is that he knows what he does and he does it

3312
03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:22.860
right.
That's his wheelhouse.
He stays in there.

3313
03:09:23.070 --> 03:09:28.070
Trump's wheelhouse is making giant gold buildings with his name on them and

3314
03:09:28.170 --> 03:09:29.003
Spray Tan.

3315
03:09:29.070 --> 03:09:32.280
He knows what the fuck to do and he knows how to make money and he doesn't give

3316
03:09:32.281 --> 03:09:35.880
a fuck about all that other stuff cause that other stuff is wasted energy for

3317
03:09:35.881 --> 03:09:36.390
him.

3318
03:09:36.390 --> 03:09:41.040
His energy is in focusing on how you get more buildings with those giant gold

3319
03:09:41.041 --> 03:09:44.700
Trump letters on it.
And no one can argue that it's been a tremendous success.

3320
03:09:45.160 --> 03:09:48.660
One of those hotels,
the water bottle had his face on it.
You know what I mean?

3321
03:09:48.661 --> 03:09:51.840
He's amazing.
Incredible.
What an achievement.

3322
03:09:52.070 --> 03:09:56.020
I've been drinking coffee bean side of his face,
but that's his thing,
right?

3323
03:09:56.080 --> 03:09:59.260
It's like,
why is it okay for your thing to be tennis?

3324
03:09:59.770 --> 03:10:02.500
And that's all you know about.
I don't even pay attention to the politics.

3325
03:10:02.710 --> 03:10:05.740
Why is that okay?
But when we see a guy like him,

3326
03:10:05.950 --> 03:10:07.420
we have a problem with it because he's not,

3327
03:10:07.421 --> 03:10:11.740
his intellectual curiosity is only about money.
So it's even grocer.
I agree.

3328
03:10:11.800 --> 03:10:14.020
Listen,
this show were to return to my point.

3329
03:10:14.080 --> 03:10:18.760
I wouldn't waste time judging anyone or is it as an individual?

3330
03:10:18.761 --> 03:10:23.200
Because I imagine if I were to spend time examining Donald Trump's past his

3331
03:10:23.201 --> 03:10:25.450
relationship with his father,
the conditions he grew up in,

3332
03:10:25.660 --> 03:10:29.200
what he felt he had to do to be a good person,
I would imagine I'd go,
yeah,

3333
03:10:29.201 --> 03:10:29.950
of course.

3334
03:10:29.950 --> 03:10:34.720
But what I would query is a system that elevates people like that.

3335
03:10:34.720 --> 03:10:39.040
And I,
you know,
the two positions of incredible power and you know,
again,

3336
03:10:39.070 --> 03:10:42.070
I believe that it's systems that need to change now individuals and I think

3337
03:10:42.071 --> 03:10:43.990
we've overly fetishized politics.

3338
03:10:43.991 --> 03:10:46.930
I don't live in this country so I don't know if it's much worse under Trump.

3339
03:10:46.931 --> 03:10:50.230
I've heard some things that sound really bad then it was under Barack Obama,

3340
03:10:50.231 --> 03:10:52.720
but what my more,
my general belief is,

3341
03:10:52.990 --> 03:10:56.320
you indeed don't fetishize individuals and get distracted to think about

3342
03:10:56.321 --> 03:10:59.500
changing the system because you're not getting that middle class lifestyle for

3343
03:10:59.501 --> 03:11:03.430
everyone.
[inaudible] no one's offering that Bernie Sanders isn't offering that.

3344
03:11:03.431 --> 03:11:05.860
No one's offering that.
And unless someone's offering that,
what's the,

3345
03:11:05.950 --> 03:11:07.540
where while should we get involved?

3346
03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:10.870
Have you ever talked to economists about like what is the problem?

3347
03:11:10.871 --> 03:11:15.190
What's the like people that are,
you know,
more socialistic minded,

3348
03:11:15.490 --> 03:11:17.860
there'd be more socialist minded I guess,

3349
03:11:18.520 --> 03:11:21.490
but understanding of capitalism to the point where they could point out the

3350
03:11:21.491 --> 03:11:25.930
flaws in allowing this infinite growth model where someone gets to a point like

3351
03:11:25.931 --> 03:11:28.840
a Jeff Bezos or something like that,
what would they do to mitigate that?

3352
03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:30.160
You're not going to put a cap.

3353
03:11:30.490 --> 03:11:35.490
Like that's when people say that like you're going to pay 70% of taxes over $10

3354
03:11:36.220 --> 03:11:36.221
million.

3355
03:11:36.221 --> 03:11:39.340
I was like one of the ones that was banded about people just start laughing like

3356
03:11:39.341 --> 03:11:40.960
you're out of your fucking mind.
No one's going to do that.

3357
03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:45.150
They'll get to $10 million and then they'll stop.
Yeah,
it's stupid.
It's,

3358
03:11:45.220 --> 03:11:50.220
that's I think a very linear in system and I feel that the problems are broader

3359
03:11:50.860 --> 03:11:53.680
than that.
I think that the,
like did you ever see like,
you know,

3360
03:11:53.681 --> 03:11:56.050
if you've ever watched Steve Bannon talk that he's a man,
like you know,

3361
03:11:56.051 --> 03:11:59.890
someone that I would again not politically agree with for what it's worth,

3362
03:12:00.070 --> 03:12:05.070
but when he's description of what happened in that economic crash of 2008 and

3363
03:12:05.291 --> 03:12:08.400
the decisions that were made further,
you know,
American taxpayer,

3364
03:12:08.410 --> 03:12:11.980
Tear Bay allow the light financial industry and I've seen subsequently seen a

3365
03:12:11.981 --> 03:12:14.620
documentary that said,
look,
this is why we had to do that.
These were the options.

3366
03:12:14.980 --> 03:12:19.980
But for me that is a demonstration of capitalism's inherent failings and

3367
03:12:20.321 --> 03:12:23.710
limitations that we're not talking about a system that is flawless and perfect.

3368
03:12:23.711 --> 03:12:24.740
It's pretty fucking floored.

3369
03:12:24.741 --> 03:12:28.170
Aside from the cumin collateral damage and the that you have,
again,
describe the,

3370
03:12:28.230 --> 03:12:28.520
the,

3371
03:12:28.520 --> 03:12:31.450
the communities that are impoverished and without hope and living in poverty in

3372
03:12:31.451 --> 03:12:32.920
a kind of slavery,
you know,

3373
03:12:32.980 --> 03:12:36.430
even in itself doesn't work according to its own rules.

3374
03:12:36.431 --> 03:12:41.431
It has to be art officially sustained and reboot it when it inevitably fails.

3375
03:12:42.430 --> 03:12:45.800
So the pure sign of it is that the fact that no one went to jail for the

3376
03:12:45.810 --> 03:12:48.940
subprime mortgage crisis,
those guys didn't go to jail.

3377
03:12:48.970 --> 03:12:52.400
All those guys that were the real financial were looking at it from a distance.

3378
03:12:52.401 --> 03:12:55.430
Then we're going,
I see where this is going,
like this is going to blow up.

3379
03:12:55.460 --> 03:12:58.310
And a lot of people are gonna lose their houses.
Like you guys are assholes.
Like,

3380
03:12:58.311 --> 03:12:58.570
yeah.

3381
03:12:58.570 --> 03:13:02.210
Then there was a lot of people that they engage in those predatory loans and

3382
03:13:02.480 --> 03:13:04.610
they didn't get punished.
Those,
those guys,

3383
03:13:04.760 --> 03:13:08.450
the craziest thing is a lot of them got bonuses.
Yes,
that's right.

3384
03:13:08.500 --> 03:13:10.100
There you got bonuses.
Even if the bank,

3385
03:13:10.101 --> 03:13:13.400
I bailed out and they said the bonuses are part of their contracts and if they

3386
03:13:13.401 --> 03:13:14.600
didn't honor their contracts,

3387
03:13:14.780 --> 03:13:18.200
they'd have a hard time hiring these people and there'd be chaos.

3388
03:13:18.201 --> 03:13:22.370
And they do just made a reason why they had to give them millions of dollars in

3389
03:13:22.371 --> 03:13:26.900
bonuses when they failed.
But you get a bonus and you failed,

3390
03:13:27.260 --> 03:13:30.050
like your bank failed and you still get a bonus.

3391
03:13:30.260 --> 03:13:33.830
Like you knew about those predatory loans.
You knew about those,

3392
03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:37.100
you knew about the subprime mortgage bullshit that was going down in your

3393
03:13:37.101 --> 03:13:40.090
business and you just let it ride and now you're going to get,

3394
03:13:40.270 --> 03:13:43.820
you're going gonna get a bonus.
What's the bonus for?
We can,
yeah.

3395
03:13:43.821 --> 03:13:47.810
What would you have to do to be fine if that the,
yeah,
that's the bonus system.

3396
03:13:47.811 --> 03:13:49.760
It'd be jailed.
Yeah.
I mean,

3397
03:13:49.761 --> 03:13:53.300
just think about what they're doing to Julian Assange,
right?
They're,
they're,

3398
03:13:53.440 --> 03:13:56.200
they're throwing that guy in a jail somewhere that didn't look good,

3399
03:13:56.220 --> 03:13:58.490
that embassy move.
No,
but I mean,

3400
03:13:58.491 --> 03:14:02.510
the fact that what he did was released information that everybody found very

3401
03:14:02.511 --> 03:14:06.860
interesting.
And what they did is crashed the whole fucking economy.

3402
03:14:07.220 --> 03:14:10.970
Right.
He's the,
that he was able to write that embassy idea for as long as he,

3403
03:14:10.971 --> 03:14:14.070
cause he's not actually in another country.
Is it in London?

3404
03:14:14.440 --> 03:14:17.810
I went and visited him in there.
It's a matter of fact.
Just briefly popped in.

3405
03:14:17.811 --> 03:14:19.270
So what do you think's going to happen with them?

3406
03:14:19.320 --> 03:14:23.180
Well I think he's going to end up serving a pretty lumpy prison sentence

3407
03:14:23.181 --> 03:14:25.730
somewhere.
Isn't he?
Thinks they're going to get them on though.

3408
03:14:25.760 --> 03:14:27.230
Like what are they going to charge them on?

3409
03:14:27.350 --> 03:14:29.840
They're charging them on like hacking charges or some shit now,

3410
03:14:29.841 --> 03:14:32.070
which they didn't charge him on before.
Right?

3411
03:14:32.090 --> 03:14:34.700
Is that what's emerged and he's going to be extra data to this country.

3412
03:14:34.701 --> 03:14:36.940
Is that true?
I don't know.
I don't know.

3413
03:14:37.520 --> 03:14:41.210
Well I mean again I suppose this is what happens if you challenge the interest.

3414
03:14:41.211 --> 03:14:43.340
If the powerful,
if Trump was really,

3415
03:14:43.341 --> 03:14:45.980
your Trump really wanted to get people on his side.
He pardon him.

3416
03:14:46.580 --> 03:14:48.830
Do you think about that would be popular cause like someone like that,

3417
03:14:48.831 --> 03:14:50.780
Edward Snowden.
Is it like sort of,

3418
03:14:51.710 --> 03:14:56.090
obviously I think don't put the lives of people at risk that Erin compromised

3419
03:14:56.091 --> 03:14:58.370
military positions.
That seemed like a fairly obvious thing,

3420
03:14:58.520 --> 03:15:00.470
but like I don't think they did that,
but no,
it doesn't.

3421
03:15:00.471 --> 03:15:04.220
What I understood was they got hacked and someone else released the,

3422
03:15:04.520 --> 03:15:07.010
the documents without the names redacted.
Yeah.

3423
03:15:07.011 --> 03:15:10.270
It seems to me Wiki leaks never did that.
[inaudible] Snowden,
it's,

3424
03:15:10.360 --> 03:15:13.550
it seems to qualify for a hero in pretty much any way you look at it.

3425
03:15:13.551 --> 03:15:16.850
And as a 26 year old person making that decision and you had very brilliant,

3426
03:15:16.900 --> 03:15:20.230
and I've heard him,
uh,
I think he was on Neil degrasse Tyson's podcast.

3427
03:15:20.240 --> 03:15:24.020
They talked to him.
Oh Wow.
Skyper however they did it.
But

3428
03:15:24.360 --> 03:15:25.770
<v 1>did you see in citizen for,</v>

3429
03:15:25.771 --> 03:15:28.530
there's a bit like in that film about able to snow and sit us in for,

3430
03:15:28.531 --> 03:15:31.140
there's a bit where he's just come out and he's talking to the journalists or

3431
03:15:31.141 --> 03:15:32.750
filmmakers that are making the film and scan it.

3432
03:15:32.760 --> 03:15:33.900
They can find what do you with this phone,

3433
03:15:33.990 --> 03:15:36.750
you can't leave that like everything's like in a sort of a state of mad

3434
03:15:36.751 --> 03:15:39.450
enlightenment where he's just seeing the truth.
If they're listening to us now,

3435
03:15:39.451 --> 03:15:41.010
you can't fucking have that on.
You've got to let them.

3436
03:15:41.060 --> 03:15:43.440
I like this terrifying to watch I'm on because you know,

3437
03:15:43.500 --> 03:15:46.200
obviously now he's calmed down.
He's dealt with.
He understands that,
you know,

3438
03:15:46.201 --> 03:15:49.050
but it was like a person that was emerging from having seen the other side.

3439
03:15:49.140 --> 03:15:49.710
The Matrix.

3440
03:15:49.710 --> 03:15:49.951
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

3441
03:15:49.951 --> 03:15:53.370
Many mean he was deep into it and then when he revealed all the information,

3442
03:15:53.371 --> 03:15:56.280
they had a fucking,
they were had a man hunt for him,

3443
03:15:56.580 --> 03:16:00.300
the guy to hide out in Russia.
He had to seek asylum and our enemy.

3444
03:16:00.460 --> 03:16:03.010
<v 1>Yes.
The whole thing is so strange.</v>

3445
03:16:03.360 --> 03:16:05.680
Who Do our power structures actually support?

3446
03:16:05.681 --> 03:16:08.740
If someone tells the truth that of population,
they have to flee to Russia.

3447
03:16:08.950 --> 03:16:12.820
If someone talks about improper agricultural practices,
that's against the law.

3448
03:16:12.821 --> 03:16:16.570
They can be in prison there.
It starts to reveal that the state itself,

3449
03:16:16.571 --> 03:16:17.800
the very thing that we revere,

3450
03:16:17.801 --> 03:16:21.940
the very thing that we identify is the tool of our oppression.

3451
03:16:22.020 --> 03:16:25.590
<v 3>They want to discourage people from leaking information that makes them look</v>

3452
03:16:25.591 --> 03:16:28.470
horrible.
It's that simple.
It's that simple.

3453
03:16:28.680 --> 03:16:33.300
If you look at what information he leaked and what would it did well it,

3454
03:16:34.380 --> 03:16:35.213
you know,

3455
03:16:35.910 --> 03:16:40.410
what he did was he revealed things that everyone wanted to know about that we

3456
03:16:40.411 --> 03:16:41.250
felt were crying.

3457
03:16:41.700 --> 03:16:46.700
<v 1>It makes me feel that it's as simple as if you knew what we do in order to keep</v>

3458
03:16:47.131 --> 03:16:51.510
shit running,
you would revolt.
So we are never going to let you know.
Well,

3459
03:16:51.511 --> 03:16:55.050
that for me in a sense is a path that stuffing,
we'll hold on fucking hell.

3460
03:16:55.340 --> 03:16:59.510
<v 3>Oh,
I thought you are elected officials.
You're one of us.
But no,
you're above us.</v>

3461
03:16:59.511 --> 03:17:02.600
To the point where someone leaks information about your crimes.

3462
03:17:02.930 --> 03:17:05.930
They get locked in this embassy for seven years.

3463
03:17:06.350 --> 03:17:10.520
Like what is their crime exactly in comparison to the crimes that he's revealed.

3464
03:17:10.700 --> 03:17:14.960
Yes.
That's where it's crazy that when you look at the,

3465
03:17:15.230 --> 03:17:16.070
the balance,

3466
03:17:16.071 --> 03:17:21.071
the imbalance between what his crime is and the crimes that he's revealed,

3467
03:17:21.500 --> 03:17:26.120
I mean,
he's revealed some staggering crimes and no one's concentrating on that.

3468
03:17:26.150 --> 03:17:29.490
The government is not freaking out.
We've got to,
we've left obviously,
uh,

3469
03:17:29.540 --> 03:17:32.870
we have work to do,
we have corrections to make.
There's none of that talk.

3470
03:17:32.990 --> 03:17:34.130
There's get that guy talk.

3471
03:17:34.350 --> 03:17:38.640
<v 1>That's right.
And like,
it's sort of under the veil of patriotism.</v>

3472
03:17:38.670 --> 03:17:41.080
A lot can be concealed.
And that is a,
uh,

3473
03:17:41.100 --> 03:17:45.380
an incident that capacities through several administrations.

3474
03:17:45.420 --> 03:17:49.590
So like for seven years,
yes.
It makes you think,
well,

3475
03:17:49.591 --> 03:17:53.250
what is there the what all the difference is,
you know,
like I kind of,
you know,

3476
03:17:53.251 --> 03:17:57.090
sort of been on Bill Maher show,
I like Bill Maher,
I'm up,
I'm,
you know,

3477
03:17:57.091 --> 03:18:00.960
very simple,
fake tear left.
What we need ultimately beyond left,
left wing.
I'm,

3478
03:18:00.961 --> 03:18:01.794
you know,
trying to,

3479
03:18:01.950 --> 03:18:05.070
my belief is that we should try and organize a system based on hallucinogenic

3480
03:18:05.071 --> 03:18:06.450
experience for fuck sake.
There's,

3481
03:18:06.600 --> 03:18:09.390
there's no party for me and I'm not even allowed to fucking hallucinogens.

3482
03:18:09.600 --> 03:18:14.280
So like,
you know,
so like I'm like,
I'm not a right wing person.
It's safe to say,

3483
03:18:14.520 --> 03:18:18.150
but like I feel that so many of the problems that we're experiencing now is

3484
03:18:18.151 --> 03:18:23.130
because the democratic left wing liberal organizations stopped serving the

3485
03:18:23.131 --> 03:18:27.540
people.
They were in the case of the British Labor Party designed,
set up to surf.

3486
03:18:27.541 --> 03:18:29.880
They neglected them,
they abandoned them.
You know,

3487
03:18:29.960 --> 03:18:34.110
the white with the white working class in Britain were 50 60 years ago,
told,
hey,

3488
03:18:34.111 --> 03:18:35.220
there's this thing called Britain.

3489
03:18:35.250 --> 03:18:38.490
We want you to go out there and fight and die for it.
Give up your sons.

3490
03:18:38.520 --> 03:18:42.380
Get out there.
Oh,
and now they're told,
hey,
there's no such thing as a Britain.

3491
03:18:42.381 --> 03:18:46.500
And like,
yeah,
no wonder people are confused.
No one there.

3492
03:18:46.501 --> 03:18:47.650
People are baffled.

3493
03:18:47.651 --> 03:18:52.600
No wonder there are abandoned constituencies and despair and rage.
And I,

3494
03:18:52.601 --> 03:18:55.410
I feel that in a way it's like,

3495
03:18:55.500 --> 03:18:59.560
what is patriotism resourced from a sense that we all need to belong,

3496
03:18:59.590 --> 03:19:01.810
but we want to be together that,
you know,
look,

3497
03:19:01.811 --> 03:19:05.590
we're willing to believe in a fictional idea,
a flag,

3498
03:19:05.591 --> 03:19:08.710
and a story about,
you know,
the origin of a nation.

3499
03:19:08.711 --> 03:19:12.100
Whether that's an old one like mine or a new one like this one.
You know,

3500
03:19:12.101 --> 03:19:15.940
we're willing to participate in that,
but if those values aren't real,

3501
03:19:15.941 --> 03:19:18.790
if they aren't like,
if it is,
we are going to support the most powerful.

3502
03:19:18.820 --> 03:19:23.120
We will lie to you whenever necessary.
When our lives are revealed will imprison,

3503
03:19:23.140 --> 03:19:26.560
punish,
and lie about those people.
We don't care about the most vulnerable.

3504
03:19:26.910 --> 03:19:30.250
What the fuck is the flag that we are waiving?
Who is it for?

3505
03:19:30.590 --> 03:19:34.030
<v 2>It's good point.
And on that note,
what's wrap this bitch up?
Good.</v>

3506
03:19:34.031 --> 03:19:37.420
We went out high.
We went there was a good one.
It was a good way to end it.

3507
03:19:37.930 --> 03:19:40.360
Russell,
you're awesome man.
I love show all every day.

3508
03:19:40.380 --> 03:19:44.560
You always like being around you and your book mentors.
It's out.

3509
03:19:44.561 --> 03:19:49.561
Now your podcasts would be available on luminary starting 23rd 23rd of this

3510

Gentlemen,

3511
03:20:01.790 --> 03:20:01.920
Okay.
