1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that contrast between this world</v>

2
00:00:06.911 --> 00:00:11.320
<v Speaker 1>that you were so deeply entrenched in</v>
<v Speaker 1>for two in two years and eight months</v>

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.060
<v Speaker 1>like that has got to change the way you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at human life.</v>

4
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the Gulf and wealth is so</v>

5
00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:20.620
<v Speaker 2>enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6
00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 2>they can't imagine the amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes to live in Bel Air and,</v>

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 2>and the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

8
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very difficult for someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>in California to imagine how little you</v>

9
00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:34.681
<v Speaker 2>can get by on and how close to the earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some most people on the planet live</v>

10
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a statistic</v>

11
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>that I read once that I repeat all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time because it still baffles me that if</v>

12
00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:45.340
<v Speaker 1>you make more than $34,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the one percent of the world</v>

13
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>And that is probably magnified manyfold</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Ethiopia.</v>

16
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:56.200
<v Speaker 2>In Ethiopia and Somalia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

18
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.970
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

19
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some ways,</v>

20
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 2>although they want money all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're criminals.</v>

21
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

22
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.770
<v Speaker 2>the money that we're used to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>greasing our path through life around</v>

23
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:14.830
<v Speaker 2>here is just not available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not,</v>

24
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.010
<v Speaker 2>not part of the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they do with money when they get</v>

25
00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:18.611
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

26
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.130
<v Speaker 2>it depends if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're pirates,</v>

27
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.500
<v Speaker 2>they splash out on a fancy car or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or caught you see fancy cars.</v>

28
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

29
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was placed in fancy cars.</v>

30
00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:29.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

31
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

32
00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:33.820
<v Speaker 2>So the pirates had great cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

33
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.380
<v Speaker 2>expensive suv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

34
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 2>weapons that they had bought from abroad</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe a weapons possession,</v>

35
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.340
<v Speaker 2>Mogadishu or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

36
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 2>but that's not cheap either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

37
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.850
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they bragged about how the,</v>

38
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.050
<v Speaker 2>the bullets costs like a dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each one of them.</v>

39
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.390
<v Speaker 2>I might've been wearing a band of 500</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullets.</v>

40
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the cut is expensive,</v>

41
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 2>so lots of things costs an enormous</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of money in Somalia.</v>

42
00:01:58.841 --> 00:02:02.470
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a very ordinary Somali,</v>

43
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 2>Somali you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting by on less than a dollar</v>

44
00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:07.100
<v Speaker 2>a day.</v>

45
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.100
<v Speaker 1>So there's the ordinary Somalis who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not criminals or not pirates at least.</v>

46
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.860
<v Speaker 1>And then you asked the majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority.</v>

47
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 1>And then you have these pirates that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially</v>

48
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.420
<v Speaker 1>running through the streets in Mercedes</v>
<v Speaker 1>Benz.</v>

49
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like gangsters.</v>

50
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually how one Somali,</v>

51
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 2>who had some connection to Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm describing them to me,</v>

52
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

53
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.790
<v Speaker 2>he was wandering around and got kyle</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was his hometown and in some</v>

54
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 2>way or ancestral ancestral town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had met some,</v>

55
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 2>this was before I got captured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like they were,</v>

56
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had wrapped thumping from the SUV.</v>

57
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Did they really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>American rap.</v>

58
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

59
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.440
<v Speaker 1>And then they caught us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will,</v>

60
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.410
<v Speaker 1>we went back again and they cut to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chase in another car and we got</v>

61
00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:56.680
<v Speaker 1>separated again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this time we were held for a longer</v>

62
00:02:56.681 --> 00:02:58.390
<v Speaker 1>time and whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my aunt,</v>

63
00:02:58.391 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>when she saw us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

64
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.200
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha ha.</v>

65
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>They catch you guys again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just jokingly.</v>

66
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the third time was like my,</v>

67
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 1>my dad and my mom came over this crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea because we have brothers,</v>

68
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>we had cousins in Sunny California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my mom said,</v>

69
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we just borrow their</v>

70
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 1>passports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>to cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't remember this,</v>

72
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just found out recently that what</v>

73
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother told me,</v>

74
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>my little young brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

75
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.600
<v Speaker 1>we just like a little girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a full on little girl because I</v>

76
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>thought we had a three passports and two</v>
<v Speaker 1>were boys.</v>

77
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:46.201
<v Speaker 1>One was a girl and we took straws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guest and my mom and my aunt,</v>

78
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my little brother to be a little girl.</v>

79
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>How did they make him look like a girl?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just in my little girl for two</v>

80
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>weeks just to play around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>they give them a fake name and so and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

82
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>And he was playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

84
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting ready,</v>

86
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 1>playing with Barbie dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he was preparing,</v>

87
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>preparing broke deniro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

88
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting ready for that row of his life.</v>

89
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old was he?</v>

90
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>He was two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least two or three young.</v>

91
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

92
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>we talk about determinism versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>freewill.</v>

93
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>We talk about what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

94
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 1>what's created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the possibilities that is</v>

95
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>created as Sean Carroll and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think the way you think and</v>

96
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:33.580
<v Speaker 1>why are you going to say the next thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to say and is it,</v>

97
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>how much of it is biological?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of it is your life experience?</v>

98
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>How much of it is information that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing in your head?</v>

99
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 1>How much are you interacting with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last thing that I've said to you?</v>

100
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had a.</v>

101
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 3>I was on the same Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this podcast.</v>

102
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 3>We had a long conversation about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he is very anti freewill and I</v>

103
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:50.781
<v Speaker 3>think that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

104
00:04:50.781 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't care.</v>

105
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 3>I think kind of boring to be honest is</v>
<v Speaker 3>he think it's boring room.</v>

106
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 3>I think it's boring because here's why I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's boring because there's two</v>

107
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One question is how does the world work?</v>

108
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 3>And the other question is what words</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be attached to how the world</v>

109
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 3>works and the first one is interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the second one is kind of boring.</v>

110
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.950
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen seminar,</v>

111
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.680
<v Speaker 3>I agree on how the world works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

112
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 3>But I am what philosophers call a</v>
<v Speaker 3>compatiblist when it comes to freewill,</v>

113
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

114
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that I have some ways of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking my way into overcoming the laws</v>

115
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 3>of physics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

116
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.410
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm made of atoms made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

117
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.920
<v Speaker 3>particles that obey the laws of physics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I talk about myself as a large</v>

118
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 3>collection of atoms and particles</v>
<v Speaker 3>obeying the laws of physics,</v>

119
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 3>then clearly there's no free will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just a solution to the equations</v>

120
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:41.440
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes the wave function branches</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's now two of me,</v>

121
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 3>but that's whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no spark of consciousness that</v>

122
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 3>lets me overcome what the equation site</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to happen.</v>

123
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.010
<v Speaker 3>But guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a fruitful way to go through</v>

124
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:53.410
<v Speaker 3>your life in terms of talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>

125
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:56.610
<v Speaker 3>When you meet somebody for the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and you say like,</v>

126
00:05:56.611 --> 00:05:57.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do?</v>

127
00:05:57.201 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 3>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't give you a list of their</v>

128
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 3>atoms and say what every atom is doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

129
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:03.850
<v Speaker 3>lead you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go ahead and solve for diggers</v>

130
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 3>equation to figure out what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen next.</v>

131
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You tell a story,</v>

132
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 3>you say like you're a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you grew up in a certain place,</v>

133
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 3>you have a certain jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

134
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:16.601
<v Speaker 3>You dramatically condense the</v>
<v Speaker 3>information about who you are into a few</v>

135
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 3>salient points,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and among those salient points are I am</v>

136
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:24.560
<v Speaker 3>a person who thinks and makes decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every person in the world,</v>

137
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 3>no matter how anti-free will they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>talks about people as if they make</v>

138
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 3>decisions and the reason they do is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's how people are.</v>

139
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 3>That's the best way to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

140
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 3>It's not like just a compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you don't know the atoms and</v>

141
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 3>molecules in somebody's body and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not infinitely computationally powerful,</v>

142
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.470
<v Speaker 3>so you can predict the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's correct to talk about people</v>

143
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 3>as agents who make decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We call that freewill.</v>

144
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 3>I call that freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most philosophers call it free will.</v>

145
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want to call it free will</v>
<v Speaker 3>be my guest.</v>

146
00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:54.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't really.</v>

147
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.350
<v Speaker 4>He and he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>squids.</v>

148
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.940
<v Speaker 4>This is how we learn to play with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck we play and nobody could touch the</v>

149
00:07:00.941 --> 00:07:03.490
<v Speaker 4>bad brains musically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Energy on stage,</v>

150
00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:06.010
<v Speaker 4>nothing and I will see these dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>

151
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:10.240
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you into?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the role models that,</v>

152
00:07:10.241 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 4>like you said it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

153
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.590
<v Speaker 4>we need good role models.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

154
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many fucked up people that</v>

155
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.260
<v Speaker 4>these kids want to emulate today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

156
00:07:20.261 --> 00:07:22.360
<v Speaker 4>and I see it because I came up in New</v>
<v Speaker 4>York,</v>

157
00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:24.610
<v Speaker 4>I worked in all the underground hip hop</v>
<v Speaker 4>clubs.</v>

158
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.410
<v Speaker 4>I work for the Pope Pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to deliver part to all the rap</v>

159
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:31.690
<v Speaker 4>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I deliver pot pot,</v>

160
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.990
<v Speaker 4>my friend a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>do Matt Work for Tristar.</v>

161
00:07:34.991 --> 00:07:37.060
<v Speaker 4>You can yo meet me at the Boston Comedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>Club.</v>

162
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.590
<v Speaker 4>There's this black comedian there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to be fucking huge and I</v>

163
00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:44.230
<v Speaker 4>would show up on my bike and you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>who you know,</v>

164
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:45.010
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck it was?</v>

165
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.890
<v Speaker 4>Dave spelled Dave Chappelle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dave Chappelle.</v>

166
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.430
<v Speaker 4>And when he did half baked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you notice that he put the weed</v>

167
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:54.430
<v Speaker 4>delivery guy in all bike gear will fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>you dig.</v>

168
00:07:54.431 --> 00:07:56.620
<v Speaker 4>He got that from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to show up.</v>

169
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.090
<v Speaker 4>I never carried a bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I showed up with a $40,000.</v>

170
00:08:00.091 --> 00:08:04.210
<v Speaker 4>Carbon free boat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carbon fiber frame and I had a black</v>

171
00:08:04.211 --> 00:08:07.570
<v Speaker 4>water bottle and all the weed bags was</v>
<v Speaker 4>into two water bottles.</v>

172
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:12.100
<v Speaker 4>So it just looked like I was a cyclist</v>
<v Speaker 4>out on a motherfucking out on a ride.</v>

173
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 4>Dave Chappelle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

174
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.600
<v Speaker 4>And then Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dave Chappelle,</v>

175
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.380
<v Speaker 4>when he blew up so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Matt was the guy's name.</v>

176
00:08:20.381 --> 00:08:25.381
<v Speaker 4>He was the publicist at Tristar pitches</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I delivered to him into Boston</v>

177
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.300
<v Speaker 4>Comedy Club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And within like months he was living in</v>

178
00:08:28.301 --> 00:08:33.070
<v Speaker 4>some police show fucking spot on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like second avenue and 15th in the</v>

179
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.570
<v Speaker 4>guild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had a fuck.</v>

180
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.480
<v Speaker 4>Did you get from there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

181
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.500
<v Speaker 4>there was one flight to where he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the center of the Octagon</v>

182
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.780
<v Speaker 4>Control and Peter struycken and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget who was,</v>

183
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.260
<v Speaker 4>might've been the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have been somebody else,</v>

184
00:08:44.261 --> 00:08:44.830
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

185
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.670
<v Speaker 4>he actually stopped and step back and</v>
<v Speaker 4>put us back to the fence and say,</v>

186
00:08:48.671 --> 00:08:49.241
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

187
00:08:49.241 --> 00:08:50.050
<v Speaker 4>let's fight on the fence now.</v>

188
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.220
<v Speaker 4>And he backed his self.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

189
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.450
<v Speaker 4>bond.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

190
00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:53.960
<v Speaker 4>And that's when he got caught with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>spin and elbow.</v>

191
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 4>Was it a no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stephan Bonner</v>

192
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 1>tried to spinning back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick him and he just slid out of the way</v>

193
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:00.830
<v Speaker 1>and they went right back to the fence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and went,</v>

194
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

195
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucked him up.</v>

196
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I think he hit him with the need of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body and then dropped him and then and</v>

197
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 1>then beat the shit out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

198
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:13.290
<v Speaker 1>that was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just so calm and relaxed in there</v>

199
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:17.320
<v Speaker 1>and bonner was so stiff and tight and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that was it.</v>

200
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked with Stephen for a bunch of</v>

201
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't work on for that but I don't</v>

202
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 1>recall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was also fight.</v>

203
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Bonner pissed hot.</v>

204
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I think he had an opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

205
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I think he just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

206
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I got some injuries where I'm just going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to juice it up.</v>

207
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pissed hot is better than shit hot.</v>

208
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Cause when he fought Sam Hogart at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Mack arena,</v>

209
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.690
<v Speaker 1>he fucking shit himself during the Sam.</v>

210
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Sam Hogan was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

211
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they grab and he's like,</v>

212

<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking stinky shit yourself.</v>

213
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:43.861
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

214
00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I did stuff in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst part about is we come</v>

215
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 1>backstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the tea cups,</v>

216
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.570
<v Speaker 1>they like the string up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crap,</v>

217
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.030
<v Speaker 1>the crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

218
00:09:51.031 --> 00:09:51.990
<v Speaker 1>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get my cup.</v>

219
00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:52.711
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

220
00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:56.760
<v Speaker 1>you're on your own home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended up with scissors and cut it off.</v>

221
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hilarious.</v>

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Did I got the corner I think for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight with the Great Carlson Gracie at</v>

223
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:04.410
<v Speaker 1>the time when that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Several Times.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

233
