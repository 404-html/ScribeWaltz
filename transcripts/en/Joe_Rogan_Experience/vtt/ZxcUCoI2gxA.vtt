<v Speaker 1>A video game was pretty intense to the new UFC game on ps a.</v>

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>And I know it sounds like I'm plugging but it,</v>

4
00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:10.391
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5
00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:10.990
<v Speaker 1>it was cool.</v>

6
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 1>We would yelling me and my me and my friend like God,</v>

7
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.330
<v Speaker 1>like it was that intense cause it was,</v>

8
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:16.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:19.960
<v Speaker 1>there's parts where you almost about to knock the guy out and then it's a good</v>

10
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:20.350
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

11
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good game.</v>

12
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I have fun so I can attest to it because uh,</v>

13
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I had to do the commentary for that game.</v>

14
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

16
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.800
<v Speaker 1>when you hear that EA sports game,</v>

17
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 1>that's not commentary from actual fights.</v>

18
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

19
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.780
<v Speaker 1>That's commentary.</v>

20
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Just me doing pretend and Goldberg don't pretend.</v>

21
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.790
<v Speaker 1>And Dude,</v>

22
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>we did a fuck load of hours.</v>

23
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was hours and hours and hours and hours and it was a over a long,</v>

24
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.551
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not complaining,</v>

25
00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying you got to the APP stuff and there's main man.</v>

26
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.813
<v Speaker 1>What scan?</v>

27
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

28
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

29
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

30
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:55.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the game.</v>

31
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:56.440
<v Speaker 1>You have to um,</v>

32
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.590
<v Speaker 1>have a secret.</v>

33
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I got to have a code like the Konami Code.</v>

34
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.283
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

35
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.441
<v Speaker 1>I did this.</v>

36
00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>So I can get out of doing more commentary</v>

37
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>because there was so much to do.</v>

38
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Tim,</v>

39
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I wish I looked that good.</v>

40
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>There was so much to do,</v>

41
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.033
<v Speaker 1>as though it was,</v>

43
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>it was a constant grind,</v>

44
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>but I put my app,</v>

45
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 1>my full effort into it.</v>

46
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Like I really wanted it to be good.</v>

47
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

48
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking if I was a kid and I was playing this game,</v>

49
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I would want it to sound like,</v>

50
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.870
<v Speaker 1>like a guy really got head killed.</v>

51
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.743
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

52
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 1>it's intense man.</v>

53
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Like we are here.</v>

54
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:30.811
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

55
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

56
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

57
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

58
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>it was a fun.</v>

59
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

60
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I want to see me get beat the fuck up.</v>

61
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.023
<v Speaker 1>Just Jamie.</v>

62
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Jamie shown a video of me about to get my ass kicked by Nick Diaz.</v>

63
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 2>How you get destroyed really fast with a mansion.</v>

64
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 2>If the game's realistic,</v>

65
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.893
<v Speaker 2>pull it up.</v>

66

69
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.420

70
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:52.021
<v Speaker 2>They might have.</v>

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 2>Rogan missed.</v>

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what Rogan's ground game is like.</v>

103
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.563
<v Speaker 2>Not Good.</v>

104

105
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.740
<v Speaker 2>dark shit off my back.</v>

106
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Will Rogen be able to pull off a submission from this position.</v>

107
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh rogue is it?</v>

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.300
<v Speaker 2>let them turn around.</v>

110
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 2>It's called a sweep this amount.</v>

111
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.793
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man,</v>

112

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.463
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Roll it back up.</v>

116
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh ooh.</v>

117
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>This should be illegal.</v>

118
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

119
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.130
<v Speaker 1>rolled it should be illegal back.</v>

120
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>And two people fake fight when you know one dude would beat the fuck out of me.</v>

121
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I said may so did not leave any and he gives the illusion.</v>

122
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh this is so stupid</v>

123
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.533
<v Speaker 2>staff.</v>

124
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 2>He's out.</v>

125
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

126
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>

127
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>why are they let me punch him in the head when he was unconscious?</v>

128
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they stop the fight quick and that does fake me rather than the fake</v>

129
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:37.684
<v Speaker 1>ham.</v>

130
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.321
<v Speaker 1>How'd that feel?</v>

131
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Weird,</v>

132
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.523
<v Speaker 1>but felt weird.</v>

133
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>You know what bothered me the most?</v>

134
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>The last two punches?</v>

135
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.863
<v Speaker 1>Because it wasn't,</v>

136
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>he was already unconscious.</v>

137
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>The fake him.</v>

138
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

139
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

140
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 1>did you know how hard Nick Diaz would fuck me up?</v>

141
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Like this is an embarrassment to humanity.</v>

142
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>This is allowed to be a visual image of me.</v>

143
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Beaten Nick Diaz his ass.</v>

144
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>I've dumped all the brown James before.</v>

145
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:02.150
<v Speaker 1>I do enjoy shit,</v>

146
00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:02.984
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

147
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

148
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 1>that's what?</v>

149
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.321
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

150
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:06.154
<v Speaker 1>it's an escape.</v>

151
