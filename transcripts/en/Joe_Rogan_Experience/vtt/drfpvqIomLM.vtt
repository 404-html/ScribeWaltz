00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>when you get a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

18
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not like buying gas.</v>

<v Speaker 1>don't want to give them money anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to give them extra money.</v>

25
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred and $50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He usually kind of bullshit is that.</v>

26
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:29.961
<v Speaker 1>That's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be illegal and what team </v>

27
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>does is they take it upon themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to create a moral business,</v>

28
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>a business that that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A business that makes sense.</v>

29
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>No contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bundling and ride along services,</v>

30
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 1>no overage charge.</v>

31
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.510
<v Speaker 1>If you use a certain amount of cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone minutes per month and you don't </v>

32
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.051
<v Speaker 1>use like all of your minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they roll over into the next month the </v>

<v Speaker 1>way it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan.ting.com.</v>

34
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.600

<v Speaker 1>save 50 bucks off of any smartphone and </v>

35
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.681
<v Speaker 1>they have some dope phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the one that I got from them </v>

00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>is the Samsung Galaxy s three and it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking bad ass.</v>

37
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:12.231
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially for looking at pictures and </v>

38
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>looking at websites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's enormous,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's not better.</v>

41
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:17.330
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bigger screen.</v>

42
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a bigger screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that,</v>

43
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>that part's better for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

44
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I really am so used to the apple </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating system that it will be hard </v>

45
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 1>for me to say what's better and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's the new cat.</v>

<v Speaker 2>body because it looks like it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm not a hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Porn is going on there.</v>

128
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 2>You've got a lot of porcelain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

132
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.470
<v Speaker 1>all for high end athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supplements and what we call nootropics </v>

133
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.110
<v Speaker 1>and what nootropics are is</v>

134
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.610
<v Speaker 3>far more complicated for a retard like </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself to be describing and would really</v>

135
00:06:20.611 --> 00:06:23.040
<v Speaker 3>seem hypocritical if I had some Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain with my beer.</v>

136
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Is it not good with beer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

137
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 3>Does it really freaked me out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

138
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it goes with beer.</v>

<v Speaker 3>alcohol.</v>

141
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:39.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like the opposite of nutritional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright dude.</v>

146
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.210
<v Speaker 1>extensively before we ever got involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the company.</v>

<v Speaker 1>use something,</v>

154
00:07:15.121 --> 00:07:17.550
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's a really solid product</v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

155
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.140
<v Speaker 1>That goes all the way back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleshlight.</v>

156
00:07:19.141 --> 00:07:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right Brian,</v>

158
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Speaker 1>just because I encouraged you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play a little piano in the background </v>

159
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.990
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you can have fucking aliens</v>
<v Speaker 1>landing on my head.</v>

160
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.790
<v Speaker 1>You're freaking me out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

161
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.780
<v Speaker 1>The newest things we have at a on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our hemp force,</v>

162
00:07:36.781 --> 00:07:38.760
<v Speaker 1>which is this new delicious protein </v>
<v Speaker 1>powder,</v>

163
00:07:38.761 --> 00:07:40.860
<v Speaker 1>it's the best tasting protein powder in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

164
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.290
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of hemp,</v>

165
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.750
<v Speaker 1>which is hard to get an illegal in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

166
00:07:45.751 --> 00:07:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Duncan trussell illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they've.</v>

167
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Even though it doesn't even get you </v>
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>

168
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a good answer to the question </v>
<v Speaker 1>that inevitably comes to these poor </v>

169
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.350
<v Speaker 1>folks that have to get drug tested at </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

170
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>

171
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.010
<v Speaker 1>None of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you.</v>

172
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.500
<v Speaker 1>If you eat hemp protein powder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will not test positive for thc,</v>

173
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.400
<v Speaker 1>but if you eat poppy seed bagels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will test positive for heroin,</v>

174
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.950
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to be careful about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really crazy.</v>

175
00:08:07.951 --> 00:08:12.951
<v Speaker 1>But it is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tell you not to eat poppy seed </v>

176
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:12.951
<v Speaker 1>bagels before you go in for a drug test.</v>

177
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean that you could take </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough poppy seed bagels and extract </v>

178
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:17.520
<v Speaker 1>heroin out of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know.</v>

179
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:22.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just a confusion in your </v>

180
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.701
<v Speaker 1>system because I think the urine test </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they use just register metabolites </v>

181
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.230
<v Speaker 1>and it's just the same metabolite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

182
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really understand it.</v>

183
00:08:29.791 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can get high from it.</v>

184
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could just eat all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

185
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine if that's why the appeal</v>
<v Speaker 1>of bagels at poppy seeds.</v>

186
00:08:38.431 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 1>We're just super mild heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.720
<v Speaker 1>and you just eat it in the morning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just feel everything feels so good.</v>

188
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 1>How poppy seeds don't digest full laser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're wiping emily's little </v>

189
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.620
<v Speaker 1>seeds flying all over your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

190
00:08:49.621 --> 00:08:51.090
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

191
00:08:51.091 --> 00:08:56.091
<v Speaker 1>people had been arrested for having </v>
<v Speaker 1>those seeds on them when they go to a </v>

192
00:08:56.091 --> 00:08:56.091
<v Speaker 1>like the Middle East and like really</v>

193
00:08:56.091 --> 00:09:00.980
<v Speaker 4>strict drug countries because their </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeds of like set off alarms and those </v>

194
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.581
<v Speaker 4>fucking eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember those things that they use for </v>

195
00:09:04.581 --> 00:09:07.041
<v Speaker 4>a little while that would push dust off </v>
<v Speaker 4>of you that they don't use those </v>

196
00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:08.790
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just stopped using those because dudes</v>

197
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 4>are going to jail for fucking poppy </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeds and other countries.</v>

198
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just my ex opposition anyway.</v>

199
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.250
<v Speaker 4>Have hemp force will not make you test </v>
<v Speaker 4>positive.</v>

200
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.720
<v Speaker 4>It's just the plant and it is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a.</v>

201
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 4>it's not psychoactive at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though it's completely,</v>

202
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.080
<v Speaker 4>completely illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet legal.</v>

203
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.750
<v Speaker 4>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's totally legal to have.</v>

204
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.480
<v Speaker 4>It's totally legal to sell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't grow it here.</v>

205
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.510
<v Speaker 4>You have to grow somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really a fucking.</v>

206
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.830
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

207
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:40.100
<v Speaker 4>it's clear corruption and it's clearly </v>
<v Speaker 4>the pharmaceutical drug companies </v>

208
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 4>controlling agriculture and controlling </v>
<v Speaker 4>our access to one of the greatest plants</v>

209
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:48.470
<v Speaker 4>the world has ever known for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking goofy ass reason our government </v>

210
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.470
<v Speaker 4>has let this go and place and even </v>
<v Speaker 4>though they know that this hemp plant,</v>

211
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.190
<v Speaker 4>even though it's related to marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has no psychoactive properties.</v>

212
00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.180
<v Speaker 4>You cannot get high from it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it has an amazing source of protein,</v>

213
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.930
<v Speaker 4>amazing source of amino acids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can make essential oil out of it.</v>

214
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:07.290
<v Speaker 4>You can make fuel out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can build houses with it.</v>

215
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.590
<v Speaker 4>It's really unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That hampers illegal,</v>

216
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.750

<v Speaker 4>Canada,</v>

217
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.100
<v Speaker 4>but it's legal to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you get it,</v>

218
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.350
<v Speaker 4>once you fucking let somebody else grow </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

219
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:22.390
<v Speaker 4>it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just one more giant piece of </v>

00:12:07.911 --> 00:12:12.690
<v Speaker 4>landscape all around you everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These intense green mountains and then </v>

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 4>there's a super cool people in this town</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you can walk around everywhere and</v>

263

<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

264
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:19.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

265
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:24.830
<v Speaker 4>it's like they took the best parts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Austin and moved into the North </v>

266
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:24.830
<v Speaker 4>Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

267
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 4>That's a perfect description.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like southern cool people,</v>

268
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 4>but it's like freebasing Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's possible.</v>

269
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:33.280
<v Speaker 4>It's really Canadian mining it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Austin.</v>

270
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.280
<v Speaker 4>It's Austin in an inner needle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shoved right into your Dick,</v>

271
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.960
<v Speaker 4>but you didn't get to walk around</v>

272
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.080
<v Speaker 6>new shops I went to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a tea room there were like,</v>

273
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.900
<v Speaker 6>like there's opium den with</v>

274
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.900
<v Speaker 4>blankets everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People wear their shoes.</v>

275
00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:53.901
<v Speaker 4>Offsetting like reading poetry and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking cool places.</v>

276
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.450
<v Speaker 4>So weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

277
00:12:57.451 --> 00:12:58.980
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was awesome.</v>

278
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.680
<v Speaker 4>The show was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hanging out with the people there.</v>

279
00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:06.681
<v Speaker 4>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks to my friend Sam for hooking me </v>

280
00:13:06.681 --> 00:13:06.681
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking care of us out there.</v>

281
00:13:06.681 --> 00:13:10.020
<v Speaker 4>It was a that the whole place was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>so strange.</v>

282
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.770
<v Speaker 4>It's like what a crazy little town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so small.</v>

283
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.040
<v Speaker 4>It's so small and cool and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

284
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.140
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just loved everything about it.</v>

285
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:23.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like occupy Wall Street turned into</v>
<v Speaker 4>a city now.</v>

286
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:27.240
<v Speaker 4>It's not because it's not as </v>
<v Speaker 4>complaining.</v>

287
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.870
<v Speaker 6>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it is filled with.</v>

288
00:13:29.871 --> 00:13:32.310
<v Speaker 6>I mean it is filled with subversive </v>
<v Speaker 6>folks.</v>

289
00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.230
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot.</v>

290
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.440
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of people there who are </v>
<v Speaker 6>apparently in the Environmental </v>

291
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:43.810
<v Speaker 6>Liberation Front.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ecoterrorists perhaps are hanging out </v>

292
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:43.810
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

293
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:44.510
<v Speaker 6>You should probably not say that on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>air.</v>

294
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.870
<v Speaker 6>Doing the government's work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think people.</v>

295
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.380
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'd be really hard to figure out.</v>

296
00:13:48.381 --> 00:13:53.381
<v Speaker 6>There might be ecoterrorists there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw none writing down the fucking </v>

297
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:55.220
<v Speaker 6>street on some giant tricycle</v>

298
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.320
<v Speaker 4>cases on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't a nun.</v>

299
00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:02.530
<v Speaker 4>That was a chick who's going to go fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>her boyfriend and he wanted her to come </v>

300
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:02.530
<v Speaker 4>over dress like a nun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what that was.</v>

301
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.860
<v Speaker 4>That's a gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

302
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:04.930
<v Speaker 4>That's a great girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

303
00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:09.931
<v Speaker 4>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't at my house on a tricycle </v>

304
00:14:09.931 --> 00:14:09.931
<v Speaker 4>dressed as a nun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Horny,</v>

305
00:14:09.931 --> 00:14:10.760
<v Speaker 4>but there were a few churches there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so maybe it is,</v>

306
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think religion that is.</v>

307
00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.530
<v Speaker 4>I've never been to the one place that </v>
<v Speaker 4>has no religion,</v>

308
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.540
<v Speaker 4>like even a boulder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boulder's pretty,</v>

309
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.040
<v Speaker 4>pretty liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent,</v>

310
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a left wing.</v>

311
00:14:21.181 --> 00:14:22.820
<v Speaker 4>He kind of a place that had plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 4>churches.</v>

312
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:28.240
<v Speaker 6>My friend has sent me this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I haven't listened to it yet on this </v>

313
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.380
<v Speaker 6>debate that they did as to whether or </v>
<v Speaker 6>not the world would be a better place if</v>

314
00:14:30.381 --> 00:14:34.940
<v Speaker 6>religion did not exist and it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>like these are professional debaters and</v>

315
00:14:34.941 --> 00:14:39.941
<v Speaker 6>intellectuals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember what it's like on NPR </v>

316
00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:42.461
<v Speaker 6>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the end result was they decided to </v>

317
00:14:42.461 --> 00:14:42.461
<v Speaker 6>have the world's better without religion</v>

318
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:46.010
<v Speaker 4>that they say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yes and no.</v>

319
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 4>I think religion serves as an operating </v>
<v Speaker 4>system for a lot of people and if</v>

320
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:57.070
<v Speaker 7>they didn't have religion you'd have to </v>
<v Speaker 7>explain shit to them and that could get </v>

321
00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:00.491
<v Speaker 7>so tiresome.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They will get so tiresome to sit around </v>

322
00:15:00.491 --> 00:15:04.571
<v Speaker 7>with some blundering Moron pontificating</v>
<v Speaker 7>on what it means to have a finite life </v>

323
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.970
<v Speaker 7>in an infinite universe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And what,</v>

324
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:12.240
<v Speaker 7>what part of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this part of this experience you really </v>

325
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 7>do play,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what part do you play and what,</v>

326
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 7>what is your consciousness all about and</v>
<v Speaker 7>why you so scared of it shutting off.</v>

327
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 7>Know those are scary,</v>
<v Speaker 7>terrifying questions for the average </v>

328
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 7>person and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe like,</v>

329
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:28.590
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe some ditch digger do doesn't need </v>

330
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:28.590
<v Speaker 7>to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe there's some dudes who have some.</v>

331
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:32.600
<v Speaker 7>I believe there's people that have </v>
<v Speaker 7>brains that work way better than mine.</v>

332
00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 7>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've talked to people that it's not just</v>

333
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:39.020
<v Speaker 7>a matter of education.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a matter of some people are gifted,</v>

334
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.080
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's some people have a little tiny </v>

335
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.080
<v Speaker 7>hands and then there's people that are </v>
<v Speaker 7>built like Shaquille o'neal and he could</v>

336
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.350
<v Speaker 7>grab them and crush them and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 7>fair.</v>

337
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.330
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's just the way it is.</v>

338
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.760
<v Speaker 7>And I think that there's some people </v>
<v Speaker 7>that are,</v>

339
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:55.020
<v Speaker 7>they're living in this life as humans,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but yet they're not quite human to like </v>

340
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.820
<v Speaker 7>just below human,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you talked to them and you're like,</v>

341
00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 7>um.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

342
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:04.991
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so what do you think happens when you </v>

343
00:16:04.991 --> 00:16:04.991
<v Speaker 7>die?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

344
00:16:04.991 --> 00:16:07.070
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for sure you go to heaven and you get to</v>

345
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.240
<v Speaker 7>be with Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

346
00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:12.110
<v Speaker 7>I've believed this and I was a child and</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're talking to them and you know,</v>

347
00:16:12.111 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 7>there's like a weird disconnect with the</v>
<v Speaker 7>person.</v>

348
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:16.050
<v Speaker 7>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they talk and it's not,</v>

349
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.950
<v Speaker 7>not even that they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're not just like this.</v>

350
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.790
<v Speaker 7>I've met some really intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 7>Christians.</v>

351
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:20.990
<v Speaker 7>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not what I'm saying.</v>

352
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.200
<v Speaker 7>What I'm saying is there's certain </v>
<v Speaker 7>people that are just really dumb and </v>

353
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:30.260
<v Speaker 7>they really aren't capable of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 7>about deep shit.</v>

354
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:35.410
<v Speaker 7>They're not capable of pondering the </v>
<v Speaker 7>really insane question of what the fuck </v>

355
00:16:36.081 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 7>this life is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're not capable of it.</v>

356
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:42.380
<v Speaker 7>So religion I've always felt was like a </v>
<v Speaker 7>nice scaffolding for people like that.</v>

357
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.520
<v Speaker 7>It lets them experience all the benefits</v>
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>

358
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:51.580
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of being a positive person and being a </v>

359
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:51.580
<v Speaker 7>giving and loving person.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

360
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.180
<v Speaker 7>we all experience those benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

361
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.110
<v Speaker 7>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're,</v>

362
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 7>they're teaching them to do it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

363
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.300
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the way that it's,</v>

364
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:04.370
<v Speaker 7>it's transcribing the wishes of some </v>
<v Speaker 7>holy master who created you and I said </v>

365
00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:07.160
<v Speaker 7>it once.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not fucking saying it again.</v>

366
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 7>Write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is what you do,</v>

367
00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:11.300
<v Speaker 7>do it or else you go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

368
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:16.540
<v Speaker 7>it's almost like it's structured to make</v>
<v Speaker 7>the idiots like have a really simple </v>

369
00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.550
<v Speaker 7>moral path.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like it gives you a nice little story to</v>

370
00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:27.551
<v Speaker 7>explain the really weird but real </v>
<v Speaker 7>complexities of love and positive </v>

371
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:33.581
<v Speaker 7>thinking and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and how it shapes lives and how your </v>

372
00:17:33.581 --> 00:17:35.330
<v Speaker 7>intention shapes lives in your </v>
<v Speaker 7>imagination,</v>

373
00:17:35.331 --> 00:17:40.331
<v Speaker 7>shapes your life and how this thing is </v>
<v Speaker 7>malleable and it's,</v>

374
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.170
<v Speaker 7>it's not understood.</v>

375
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.660
<v Speaker 7>This life that we're living simply not </v>
<v Speaker 7>understood.</v>

376
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.000
<v Speaker 7>That's too fucking weird for some </v>
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>

377
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 7>they're not gonna they can handle that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not getting in there,</v>

378
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:55.450
<v Speaker 7>that that's going to their ear and </v>
<v Speaker 7>bouncing off like it hit a fucking </v>

379
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.660
<v Speaker 7>trampoline.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So for some people,</v>

380
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:02.990
<v Speaker 7>religion allows them to be on a good </v>
<v Speaker 7>path.</v>

381
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 7>It allows them to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

382
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:10.671
<v Speaker 7>to do good and to experience the result </v>
<v Speaker 7>of that even though they're doing it </v>

383
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:16.140
<v Speaker 7>because of some fictional character,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like they're still doing the same.</v>

384
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.320
<v Speaker 7>They're doing the correct things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So like when religion gets nutty when </v>

385
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.611
<v Speaker 7>you get into like the inquisition or </v>
<v Speaker 7>stabbing cartoon makers because they </v>

386
00:18:25.611 --> 00:18:29.931
<v Speaker 7>drew your guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When religion goes completely off the </v>

387
00:18:29.931 --> 00:18:30.300
<v Speaker 7>tracks like that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's when it becomes a problem.</v>

388
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.140
<v Speaker 7>But I think that's not the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 7>religious people.</v>

389
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.320
<v Speaker 7>I think the majority of religious people</v>
<v Speaker 7>probably benefit from it in a sense of </v>

390
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.440
<v Speaker 7>community for sure.</v>

391
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.600
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>churches are a big part of neighborhoods</v>

392
00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:43.470
<v Speaker 7>and communities,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

393
00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:46.500
<v Speaker 7>it's a big part of how people interact </v>
<v Speaker 7>with each other.</v>

394
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.560
<v Speaker 7>And if you could find something that </v>
<v Speaker 7>was,</v>

395
00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.380
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a religion where,</v>

396
00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.520
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it made sense to you,</v>

397
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.800
<v Speaker 7>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if it was a logical religion,</v>

398
00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:01.040
<v Speaker 7>it actually would probably be a good </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing to be a part of because you're,</v>

399
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:06.111
<v Speaker 7>what you're doing is you're committing </v>
<v Speaker 7>your family and you're committing all </v>

400
00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:08.871
<v Speaker 7>the families around you that are all in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the sort of community together to take </v>

401
00:19:08.871 --> 00:19:09.790
<v Speaker 7>part in some sort of journey of </v>
<v Speaker 7>spiritual Islam.</v>

402
00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.900
<v Speaker 6>Can I play devil's advocate literally?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

403
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.570
<v Speaker 6>Against religion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

404
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:14.890
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I agree with you,</v>

405
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:21.510
<v Speaker 6>but I think that the problem is that it </v>
<v Speaker 6>creates a not only a structure where </v>

406
00:19:21.581 --> 00:19:26.581
<v Speaker 6>people can sort of rest and have an </v>
<v Speaker 6>ethical system that they're not going to</v>

407
00:19:26.681 --> 00:19:31.681
<v Speaker 6>come up with on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But obviously the danger of all that is </v>

408
00:19:31.751 --> 00:19:36.520
<v Speaker 6>that certain unscrupulous human beings </v>
<v Speaker 6>have figured out that if they put on the</v>

409
00:19:36.521 --> 00:19:41.521
<v Speaker 6>right costume,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can convince dopes to give them </v>

410
00:19:41.521 --> 00:19:43.060
<v Speaker 6>cows suck their day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>take gold.</v>

411
00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.640
<v Speaker 6>Because all they have to say is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they're like,</v>

412
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.580
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're the priests.</v>

413
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.370
<v Speaker 6>And religious leaders become like gods </v>
<v Speaker 6>agents,</v>

414
00:19:51.371 --> 00:19:53.170
<v Speaker 6>like ca for God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where they're like,</v>

415
00:19:53.171 --> 00:19:55.330
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm taking the cause for God.</v>

416
00:19:55.331 --> 00:19:58.840
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you what God wants and it </v>
<v Speaker 6>wants you to blow me.</v>

417
00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.720
<v Speaker 6>Conveniently in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why,</v>

418
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:06.750
<v Speaker 6>because he's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he wants you to suck my dick and he </v>

419
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.240
<v Speaker 6>wants seven of your cows.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know why likes cow</v>

420
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.780
<v Speaker 7>and he would like 10 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything you make for the rest of your</v>

421
00:20:11.781 --> 00:20:12.740
<v Speaker 7>life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what he said.</v>

422
00:20:12.741 --> 00:20:14.990
<v Speaker 7>I just don't kill the Messenger.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what he said.</v>

423
00:20:14.991 --> 00:20:17.690
<v Speaker 7>We're not going to put it on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just want you to continue to pay that.</v>

424
00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.280
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just that's not even on paper,</v>

425
00:20:19.281 --> 00:20:20.270
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>When you tithe,</v>

426
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:25.010
<v Speaker 7>it's not like written somewhere or you </v>
<v Speaker 7>have to give 10 percent of your money.</v>

427
00:20:25.011 --> 00:20:26.960
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Isn't that some people just do.</v>

428
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:31.090
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if there's a scriptural </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing that says 10 percent.</v>

429
00:20:31.091 --> 00:20:34.090
<v Speaker 6>I think it's something that just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 6>seems like a logical number,</v>

430
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:39.270
<v Speaker 6>but I remember that it was a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago in India and in a temple,</v>

431
00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.360
<v Speaker 6>they like opened up at the faults in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>temple.</v>

432
00:20:43.361 --> 00:20:48.361
<v Speaker 6>They hadn't opened it up or they found </v>
<v Speaker 6>some vaults and it was just filled with </v>

433
00:20:48.361 --> 00:20:51.451
<v Speaker 6>gold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just filled with fucking gold and you </v>

434
00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:55.231
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone around the temple was in offer </v>

435
00:20:55.231 --> 00:20:57.150
<v Speaker 6>all this money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when you really think about what </v>

436
00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.281
<v Speaker 6>that goal came from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it came from hypnotized people who </v>

437
00:20:59.281 --> 00:21:01.750
<v Speaker 6>believed that these priests were in some</v>
<v Speaker 6>way representing God.</v>

438
00:21:01.751 --> 00:21:03.970
<v Speaker 6>And then the gold didn't even go </v>
<v Speaker 6>anywhere.</v>

439
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.180
<v Speaker 6>It molded in the basement of a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>temple.</v>

440
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.130
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's so when,</v>

441
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:12.730
<v Speaker 6>when you see that there's that level of </v>
<v Speaker 6>exploitation that happens in like you,</v>

442
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:17.850
<v Speaker 6>you retweeted that amazing youtube video</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the guy whose job it is to suck the </v>

443
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:22.180
<v Speaker 6>freshly circumcised kids cock.</v>

444
00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:25.630
<v Speaker 1>And he's explaining why according to </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

445
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.700
<v Speaker 1>that's in my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy in my act.</v>

446
00:21:27.701 --> 00:21:30.060
<v Speaker 1>People think that that's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the really is real.</v>

447
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.570
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't believe it do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did think you were exaggerating.</v>

448
00:21:32.571 --> 00:21:34.180
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't believe that that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

449
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.390
<v Speaker 6>an actual.</v>

450
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

451
00:21:36.371 --> 00:21:41.371
<v Speaker 1>it's not only that he was justifying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was justifying it by quoting the </v>

452
00:21:41.371 --> 00:21:44.510
<v Speaker 1>pages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says in page 64 chapters.</v>

453
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.920
<v Speaker 1>He's going through all this nonsense </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his fucking wizard outfit on his </v>

454
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.461
<v Speaker 1>goofy ass beard and he's explaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it says it's okay to suck that </v>

455
00:21:53.461 --> 00:21:53.650
<v Speaker 1>baby's Davies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so.</v>

456
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.650
<v Speaker 1>He's so completely lost his objectivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he,</v>

457
00:21:56.651 --> 00:22:01.651
<v Speaker 1>he is actually trying to explain why </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is necessary.</v>

458
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a distinction to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>between that deck,</v>

459
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.380
<v Speaker 1>that baby deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a baby's deck,</v>

460
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a bleeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>babysit a screaming babies there can,</v>

461
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I say in the bit about it that I do</v>

462
00:22:15.821 --> 00:22:20.821
<v Speaker 1>in my act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how the fuck do we know that that </v>

463
00:22:20.821 --> 00:22:23.130
<v Speaker 1>kid can't remember that we're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming just because he can't talk and </v>

464
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:23.130
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

465
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:27.811
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't have a way to express </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much it sucks that you cut his dick </v>

466
00:22:27.811 --> 00:22:27.910
<v Speaker 1>and start sucking on it.</v>

467
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.540
<v Speaker 1>But for sure you don't know whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not that baby can remember that.</v>

468
00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:36.541

<v Speaker 1>moment and I remember some intensely </v>

469
00:22:36.541 --> 00:22:38.950
<v Speaker 1>traumatic moments from when I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would think that would be something</v>

<v Speaker 1>that would fucking haunt the back of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain for the rest of your life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The majority of Americans are mutilated </v>

489
00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.480
<v Speaker 1>and it's a weird thing with people where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to admit that this is </v>

490
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.170
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really kind of people.</v>

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:41.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like skin is there to protect the </v>

494
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.731
<v Speaker 1>tip of your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think uncircumcised macaques </v>

<v Speaker 1>the skin is</v>

496
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.980
<v Speaker 7>supposed to protect the tip of your Dick</v>
<v Speaker 7>and your Dick is supposed to be like </v>

497
00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.101
<v Speaker 7>glistening mucusy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's supposed to be like super </v>

498
00:23:54.101 --> 00:23:57.071
<v Speaker 7>sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but instead they hacked that shit off </v>

499
00:23:57.071 --> 00:23:58.490
<v Speaker 7>and the tip of your Dick Dries out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not supposed to be dry like that.</v>

500
00:23:58.491 --> 00:24:01.340
<v Speaker 7>It's supposed to be moist like inside a </v>
<v Speaker 7>woman's vagina.</v>

501
00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:06.341
<v Speaker 7>That's what your Dick supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>like and it's supposed to feel better </v>

502
00:24:06.341 --> 00:24:09.101
<v Speaker 7>that way because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because if it's moist and slippery and </v>

503
00:24:09.101 --> 00:24:13.241
<v Speaker 7>then there's this nonsense that people </v>
<v Speaker 7>are pushing and it's all been disproven </v>

504
00:24:13.241 --> 00:24:16.930
<v Speaker 7>by science about aids.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People are saying that it's like to </v>

505
00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:19.930
<v Speaker 7>protect people from aids.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like that is one of the craziest ideas I</v>

506
00:24:19.931 --> 00:24:24.931
<v Speaker 7>have ever fucking heard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that somehow or another extra for </v>

507
00:24:24.931 --> 00:24:26.630
<v Speaker 7>skin?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dick skin is gonna protect you.</v>

508
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:31.690
<v Speaker 7>If you fuck a guy got aids.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like that is one of the craziest ideas </v>

509
00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.051
<v Speaker 7>I've ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you're going gonna fuck that guy </v>

510
00:24:35.051 --> 00:24:35.051
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's got aids.</v>

511
00:24:35.051 --> 00:24:35.051
<v Speaker 7>Like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm circumcised.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Oh well go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go fuck away.</v>

513
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.010

<v Speaker 7>Like this.</v>

514
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.460
<v Speaker 7>Not Protecting you from AIDS,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's no fucking way that protects you</v>

515
00:24:43.461 --> 00:24:45.380
<v Speaker 7>from aids.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's ridiculous,</v>

516
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:50.770
<v Speaker 7>but we we can justify doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We want to justify that it was done to </v>

517
00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:51.470
<v Speaker 7>us and we were in denial about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're,</v>

518
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:55.640
<v Speaker 7>you're hacking off a piece of a little </v>
<v Speaker 7>kid's Dick and there's no science for it</v>

519
00:24:55.670 --> 00:25:00.670
<v Speaker 7>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's craziness and the majority of </v>

520
00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:00.670
<v Speaker 7>people do it.</v>

521
00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:05.410
<v Speaker 4>How many pounds of baby for skin meet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's generated a year enough to feed </v>

522
00:25:07.101 --> 00:25:11.000
<v Speaker 4>like a couple dogs for life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

523
00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:15.110
<v Speaker 4>Couple bears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thinking about all the babies being born</v>

524
00:25:15.111 --> 00:25:16.280
<v Speaker 4>and just chop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chop,</v>

525
00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:17.390
<v Speaker 4>chop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>screaming.</v>

526
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.600
<v Speaker 4>If you could put together all the babies</v>
<v Speaker 4>being born,</v>

527
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:25.780
<v Speaker 4>coming out of pussies all at once and </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting their dicks circumcised </v>

528
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.160
<v Speaker 4>altogether and one screaming man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a V,</v>

529
00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.600
<v Speaker 4>a dubstep music video.</v>

530
00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:41.700
<v Speaker 8>I think it would.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think.</v>

531
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:41.850
<v Speaker 8>I think</v>

532
00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:46.940
<v Speaker 4>you are underestimating the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>force can meet that gets generated by </v>

533
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.900
<v Speaker 4>the feed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you hear about that guy who fell </v>

534
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:51.900
<v Speaker 4>into his hogs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hogs,</v>

<v Speaker 4>stupid animals that would eat you if you</v>

539
00:26:00.061 --> 00:26:01.150

<v Speaker 4>Anything.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Seven hundred pounds like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just started chewing on.</v>

541
00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.510
<v Speaker 4>I bet it was a quick death though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they,</v>

542
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.050
<v Speaker 4>they fucked him up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

543
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:15.080
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they ate most of them before the people </v>

544
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.810
<v Speaker 4>even found like the guy went missing for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a few hours by the time they got there.</v>

545
00:26:15.811 --> 00:26:18.780
<v Speaker 4>He was just disemboweled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had just eaten the shit out of him.</v>

546
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:19.230
<v Speaker 4>Well they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

547
00:26:19.231 --> 00:26:20.480
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't even find him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

548
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.070
<v Speaker 4>Most of them was missing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really scary with a picket duty.</v>

549
00:26:24.071 --> 00:26:25.860
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the Tibetans skier at your.</v>

550
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.740
<v Speaker 4>With both pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wild pigs are even better than that.</v>

551
00:26:28.741 --> 00:26:30.180
<v Speaker 4>You don't even have to mash up the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bones,</v>

552
00:26:30.181 --> 00:26:32.610
<v Speaker 4>the do it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll take care of everything.</v>

553
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.240
<v Speaker 4>The pigs are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

554
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:39.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're responsible for more deaths per </v>

555
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.710
<v Speaker 4>year than any of the livestock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy when you think about like </v>

556
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.710
<v Speaker 4>bowls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But no.</v>

557
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.370
<v Speaker 4>Pigs are responsible for more deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea.</v>

558
00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Pigs are fucking for a wild pig.</v>

559
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:52.010
<v Speaker 7>Especially wild pigs are really creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That just doesn't go through my list of </v>

560
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:56.061
<v Speaker 7>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I might die that you've never seen the </v>

561
00:26:56.061 --> 00:26:57.150
<v Speaker 7>pig show a pig man.</v>

563
00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:02.780
<v Speaker 7>I've ever seen on television.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:06.090
<v Speaker 7>Is a guy named pig man and he lives in </v>
<v Speaker 7>south Texas and the pig.</v>

565
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.230
<v Speaker 7>The wild pig problem in south Texas is </v>
<v Speaker 7>like roaches in Manhattan.</v>

566
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.030
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it is bananas.</v>

<v Speaker 7>there are and they're huge and they're </v>

568
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.041
<v Speaker 7>wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's what happens with pigs is a pig </v>

569
00:27:22.041 --> 00:27:22.650
<v Speaker 7>when they leave the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's really weird.</v>

570
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.610
<v Speaker 7>When they leave captivity within three </v>
<v Speaker 7>weeks,</v>

571
00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:30.030
<v Speaker 7>their body changes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>their snout starts to grow longer,</v>

572
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.910
<v Speaker 7>their hair gets thicker and bushier </v>
<v Speaker 7>their fans,</v>

573
00:27:32.911 --> 00:27:35.490
<v Speaker 7>their tusks grow longer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's really weird,</v>

574
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.850
<v Speaker 7>like they physically morph and it starts</v>
<v Speaker 7>in just three weeks.</v>

575
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:43.970
<v Speaker 7>As soon as they have to fend for </v>
<v Speaker 7>themselves as soon as the food's not </v>

576
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.880
<v Speaker 7>continually delivered to them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you keep them in like this fetus </v>

577
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.451
<v Speaker 7>form.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When you continually deliver food to </v>

578
00:27:50.451 --> 00:27:50.451
<v Speaker 7>them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you see pigs,</v>

579
00:27:50.451 --> 00:27:52.800
<v Speaker 7>you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're fat and they're lazy and they're</v>

580
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:57.801
<v Speaker 7>just laying around and we just stuff </v>
<v Speaker 7>them and overstuff them and then </v>

581
00:27:57.801 --> 00:28:01.110
<v Speaker 7>eventually slaughter them that they do </v>
<v Speaker 7>not even remotely resemble wild pigs.</v>

582
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.330
<v Speaker 7>Wild pigs are mother fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>

583
00:28:03.331 --> 00:28:06.300
<v Speaker 7>and they will attack you like this one </v>
<v Speaker 7>and this one show.</v>

584
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:11.450
<v Speaker 7>This guy shot a wild pig with two arrows</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it didn't kill it and the thing </v>

585
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:14.790
<v Speaker 7>charged them from the bushes and he's </v>
<v Speaker 7>unloading a pistol into it.</v>

586
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:15.600
<v Speaker 7>Blab,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Blab,</v>

587
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:16.920
<v Speaker 7>blab.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Plan as a thing,</v>

588
00:28:16.921 --> 00:28:21.921
<v Speaker 7>rushes him a death run.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's with tusks and there are hundreds </v>

<v Speaker 7>of pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 7>three,</v>

<v Speaker 7>500 pounds,</v>

591
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.410
<v Speaker 7>wild pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they're everywhere.</v>

592
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:27.090
<v Speaker 7>There are millions of them in Texas.</v>

593
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:32.540
<v Speaker 7>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>pig man and Ted nugent get a helicopter </v>

594

<v Speaker 7>helicopter shooting these pigs out of </v>

595
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:37.410
<v Speaker 7>the sky,</v>

<v Speaker 7>in a one hour show.</v>

598
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.220
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing the different lives people </v>
<v Speaker 7>are having.</v>

662
00:31:33.221 --> 00:31:38.221
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they come from farms that come from </v>

663
00:31:38.221 --> 00:31:41.680
<v Speaker 4>these crazy places where you stuff a </v>
<v Speaker 4>million animals on three acres and uh,</v>

664
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it smells like death.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

666
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.820
<v Speaker 4>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Farms are fucking creepy man.</v>

667
00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:51.040
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like cattle farms,</v>

668
00:31:51.041 --> 00:31:56.041
<v Speaker 4>whether they butcher cows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went and did a fear factor on one of </v>

669
00:31:56.041 --> 00:32:00.241
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to tell you about this other guy </v>

670
00:32:00.241 --> 00:32:00.241
<v Speaker 4>on fear factor tube goes with what we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about earlier about religion.</v>

671
00:32:00.241 --> 00:32:02.500
<v Speaker 4>Remind me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we went to this thing.</v>

672
00:32:02.501 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 4>We had to do this a slaughterhouse </v>
<v Speaker 4>episode.</v>

673
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.440
<v Speaker 4>It was a fucked up show man where we </v>
<v Speaker 4>gave these people,</v>

674
00:32:08.441 --> 00:32:13.441
<v Speaker 4>it was like a bathtub of blood and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a dunk their head in and pull out </v>

675
00:32:13.441 --> 00:32:17.760
<v Speaker 4>these rings that grabbed them with their</v>
<v Speaker 4>face and pull out these rings and they </v>

676
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.640
<v Speaker 4>were just covered in blood and one guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

677
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:22.360
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't do it.</v>

678
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.860
<v Speaker 4>It was cold water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The water.</v>

679
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:28.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean the blood rather was really cold </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it had to be 38 degrees because </v>

680
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.840
<v Speaker 4>otherwise it can go bad and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>people sick.</v>

681
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:33.760
<v Speaker 4>So we had to change the blood for every </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

682
00:32:33.761 --> 00:32:35.750
<v Speaker 4>I think that was polite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

683
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:40.830
<v Speaker 4>well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we had to do it for health </v>

684
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.830
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

685
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.830
<v Speaker 4>I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I remember being super,</v>

686
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:41.870
<v Speaker 4>super cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

687
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:44.930
<v Speaker 4>this guy starts going nuts and smashing </v>
<v Speaker 4>the blood.</v>

688
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:50.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the Hulk and screaming and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy had been in the parking lot </v>

689
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:54.431
<v Speaker 4>before the show.</v>

<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

806
00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:51.970
<v Speaker 6>his disciples were all gathered together</v>
<v Speaker 6>in some,</v>

807
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.780
<v Speaker 6>like hiding out and like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he appeared to them or the doors</v>

808
00:38:55.781 --> 00:39:00.781
<v Speaker 6>opened and a wind blew through and </v>
<v Speaker 6>suddenly they were able to speak in </v>

809
00:39:00.781 --> 00:39:04.411
<v Speaker 6>every language and they all started </v>
<v Speaker 6>speaking and all the languages of the </v>

810
00:39:04.411 --> 00:39:04.600
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the myth.</v>

811
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.440
<v Speaker 6>So pentecostal churches,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they will,</v>

812
00:39:08.441 --> 00:39:12.460
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>try to induce this state,</v>

813
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:17.760
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know you've seen it and they handle </v>

814
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:17.760
<v Speaker 6>rattlesnakes do because that was the </v>
<v Speaker 6>other thing.</v>

815
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.450
<v Speaker 6>He gave them power to take up serpents.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they.</v>

816
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:20.140
<v Speaker 6>So they have these</v>

817
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.650
<v Speaker 1>rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We handle rattlesnakes.</v>

818
00:39:21.651 --> 00:39:22.860
<v Speaker 1>So what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get bit,</v>

819
00:39:22.861 --> 00:39:23.490
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

820
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:26.810
<v Speaker 6>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they get bitten and they die.</v>

821
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.080
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look up pentecostal snake handling.</v>

822
00:39:30.081 --> 00:39:33.650
<v Speaker 6>He never seen that Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've never seen snake handlers?</v>

823
00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:38.740
<v Speaker 6>I've seen snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They dance around with the snakes up in </v>

824
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:38.740
<v Speaker 6>the mountains.</v>

825
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:43.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy whose father died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a snake handler and then he just </v>

826
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:43.780
<v Speaker 1>died really recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was one of those?</v>

827
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Those a snake handler guys.</v>

828
00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:48.710
<v Speaker 6>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is just the fucking worst man.</v>

829
00:39:48.711 --> 00:39:51.710
<v Speaker 6>That is the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's so creepy.</v>

830
00:39:51.711 --> 00:39:55.790
<v Speaker 6>It's such the opposite of what that </v>
<v Speaker 6>religion.</v>

831
00:39:55.850 --> 00:40:00.850
<v Speaker 6>It's so weird that Christianity managed </v>
<v Speaker 6>to mutate into like malnourished country</v>

832
00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:07.901
<v Speaker 6>people talking and fake languages and </v>
<v Speaker 6>holding snakes on a Sunday.</v>

833
00:40:08.391 --> 00:40:09.920
<v Speaker 6>That's fucking weird,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

834
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:11.540
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a very weird.</v>

835
00:40:11.541 --> 00:40:16.541
<v Speaker 6>It's so strange how religion can mutate </v>
<v Speaker 6>because like if you look at that versus </v>

836
00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:18.890
<v Speaker 6>Catholicism,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's two completely different things.</v>

837
00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from a just from may serpent </v>

838
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.690
<v Speaker 1>handling pastor dies from rattlesnake </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight bite.</v>

839
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Just like his father.</v>

840
00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.570
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

841
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:31.280
<v Speaker 6>He's in West Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hala,</v>

842
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:33.840
<v Speaker 6>his faith wasn't strong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that what they think?</v>

843
00:40:33.841 --> 00:40:38.841
<v Speaker 6>Do they think that like their faith </v>
<v Speaker 6>failed and that's why the snake bit him </v>

844
00:40:38.841 --> 00:40:38.841
<v Speaker 6>or</v>

845
00:40:38.841 --> 00:40:43.240
<v Speaker 1>we did some traveling through West </v>
<v Speaker 1>Virginia and I got to just see some </v>

846
00:40:43.761 --> 00:40:47.350
<v Speaker 1>really bizarre places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of them was um,</v>

847
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:52.620
<v Speaker 1>a bar that was a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a house and then the downstairs </v>

848
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.410
<v Speaker 1>was the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just,</v>

849
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.530
<v Speaker 1>they had like a plastic sign that said </v>
<v Speaker 1>bar.</v>

850
00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:03.280
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it was a fucking house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like somehow or another they had </v>

851
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.760
<v Speaker 1>converted their house into a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so bizarre.</v>

852
00:41:04.761 --> 00:41:08.540
<v Speaker 1>And then right next door was always a </v>
<v Speaker 1>church and then there was always a strip</v>

853
00:41:08.541 --> 00:41:09.980
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was strip club,</v>

854
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:11.810
<v Speaker 1>church Bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strip club,</v>

855
00:41:11.811 --> 00:41:13.190
<v Speaker 1>church bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you had.</v>

856
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.920
<v Speaker 6>Weird shit goes on in those Hollers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joe and the uh,</v>

857
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.760
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and a city next to where my mom lives.</v>

858
00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:25.600
<v Speaker 6>This guy fucking hacked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His Dad sit through his limbs on the </v>

859
00:41:28.311 --> 00:41:31.610
<v Speaker 6>Blue Ridge Parkway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is just up in the woods.</v>

860
00:41:31.611 --> 00:41:36.611
<v Speaker 6>He was through his head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the forest and then his arm somewhere </v>

861
00:41:36.611 --> 00:41:37.910
<v Speaker 6>and then his arm somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A Betty wasn't a good dad.</v>

862
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:40.160
<v Speaker 6>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

863
00:41:40.161 --> 00:41:41.090
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I asked my mom,</v>

864
00:41:41.091 --> 00:41:41.570
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

865
00:41:41.571 --> 00:41:46.571
<v Speaker 6>the dad's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I realized that the exact same thing </v>

866
00:41:46.571 --> 00:41:46.571
<v Speaker 6>where I blame the dad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she's like,</v>

867
00:41:46.571 --> 00:41:46.790
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't that,</v>

868
00:41:46.791 --> 00:41:49.190
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the kid was just fucking crazy.</v>

869
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:51.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

870
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:56.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>regardless of how bad or daddy or I </v>

871
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:57.170
<v Speaker 6>don't know if you deserve to have your </v>
<v Speaker 6>limbs chopped off,</v>

872
00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.610
<v Speaker 6>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well there are exceptions.</v>

873
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.260
<v Speaker 6>Relentless for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She deserved to get 20 years straight.</v>

874
00:42:03.261 --> 00:42:05.060
<v Speaker 6>He just managed to crawl away to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>ash,</v>

875
00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:07.460
<v Speaker 6>been trying to get to the expert 20 </v>
<v Speaker 6>years,</v>

876
00:42:07.461 --> 00:42:12.461
<v Speaker 6>and you never lost your heart on and </v>
<v Speaker 6>develop those strength just from </v>

877
00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:15.770
<v Speaker 6>resisting ass rape.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Man.</v>

878
00:42:15.771 --> 00:42:20.771
<v Speaker 6>But that fucking goddamn idea that </v>
<v Speaker 6>people just walk from time to time this </v>

879
00:42:20.771 --> 00:42:21.170
<v Speaker 6>member,</v>
<v Speaker 6>each other.</v>

880
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.740
<v Speaker 6>It's really strange that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

881
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:27.020
<v Speaker 6>in the same way that what's his name </v>
<v Speaker 6>flies around blast and pigs.</v>

882
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:32.290
<v Speaker 6>You also know that at this very moment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>multiple limbs are being hacked off and </v>

883
00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:36.100
<v Speaker 6>a variety of basements and back rooms </v>
<v Speaker 6>and force like definitely more than like</v>

884
00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:39.500
<v Speaker 6>50 people at this very moment are </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably getting their arms chopped off.</v>

885
00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:40.890
<v Speaker 7>Wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how about this?</v>

886
00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:45.891
<v Speaker 7>How about thinking about all the people </v>
<v Speaker 7>in different parts of the world that </v>

887
00:42:45.891 --> 00:42:48.291
<v Speaker 7>have to walk around on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 7>knowing that they're killing machines </v>

888
00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:51.570
<v Speaker 7>flying over their sky every day at any </v>
<v Speaker 7>point in time.</v>

889
00:42:51.571 --> 00:42:56.571
<v Speaker 7>You could be the wrong place at the </v>
<v Speaker 7>wrong time and a hell fire missile comes</v>

890
00:42:57.361 --> 00:43:02.361
<v Speaker 7>out of one of these fucking flying </v>
<v Speaker 7>killer robots and annihilates a house </v>

891
00:43:02.361 --> 00:43:02.361
<v Speaker 7>that you're standing next to</v>

892
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:05.360
<v Speaker 6>Predator drones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That shit's intense.</v>

893
00:43:05.361 --> 00:43:08.750
<v Speaker 6>And when you think about the future,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've talked about this,</v>

894
00:43:08.751 --> 00:43:10.670
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think we've talked about </v>
<v Speaker 6>this on the podcast,</v>

895
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:15.671
<v Speaker 6>which is that when you see those Goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 6>quadra copters that can fly perfect </v>

896
00:43:15.671 --> 00:43:18.110
<v Speaker 6>formations,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you see those dogs that they've</v>

897
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:19.940
<v Speaker 6>used that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's that dog called?</v>

898
00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.910
<v Speaker 6>Know the robot dog,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because people don't understand that.</v>

899
00:43:22.911 --> 00:43:26.270
<v Speaker 6>If they can make that thing that size,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can make it bigger.</v>

900
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:31.660
<v Speaker 6>They can make that thing real fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>big so that you've got truck sized robot</v>

901
00:43:31.971 --> 00:43:35.840
<v Speaker 6>dogs lumbering into your village opening</v>
<v Speaker 6>up slats.</v>

902
00:43:35.841 --> 00:43:40.010
<v Speaker 6>That quadric copters fly out of blast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everyone in the village,</v>

903
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cremate them or whatever,</v>

904
00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.920
<v Speaker 6>suck them into the dog and walk away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That could be the future of warfare.</v>

905
00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:49.460
<v Speaker 7>It's like a Trojan horse at Trojan horse</v>
<v Speaker 7>filled with Quadra copters.</v>

906
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:51.440
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's completely possible.</v>

907
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:56.590
<v Speaker 7>And not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not even remotely outside the realm of </v>

908
00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:56.590
<v Speaker 7>possibility because where do you think </v>
<v Speaker 7>that they're?</v>

909
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.430
<v Speaker 7>They're learning how to build these </v>
<v Speaker 7>robots.</v>

910
00:43:58.431 --> 00:44:03.200
<v Speaker 7>It's Darpa.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Darpa is creating these robot dog</v>

911
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.140
<v Speaker 6>Darpa stand for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

912
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:08.600
<v Speaker 6>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Darpa gives me that fucking creeps.</v>

913
00:44:08.601 --> 00:44:11.180
<v Speaker 6>Every time I see any Darpa rate later </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>

914
00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:11.740
<v Speaker 6>it's always</v>

915
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:16.050
<v Speaker 7>defense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Advanced Research Projects Agency.</v>

916
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:19.140
<v Speaker 7>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is scary?</v>

917
00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:23.800
<v Speaker 7>That's patient.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We named that the scary concern.</v>

918
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:29.390
<v Speaker 7>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're just finding new ways to fuck </v>

919
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.390
<v Speaker 7>people up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what they do.</v>

920
00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:32.460
<v Speaker 7>It's funny how we like to call it </v>
<v Speaker 7>defense.</v>

921
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:33.960
<v Speaker 4>How much money we're gonna spend on </v>
<v Speaker 4>defense.</v>

922
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.560
<v Speaker 4>It's seems pretty authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our offense budget.</v>

923
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's our offense budget.</v>

924
00:44:39.241 --> 00:44:42.000
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It shit like robot dogs.</v>

925
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:44.670
<v Speaker 4>Come on son.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those things are fucking terrifying.</v>

926
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.320
<v Speaker 4>Robot dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't kick over.</v>

927
00:44:46.321 --> 00:44:47.850
<v Speaker 4>They'd get back up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:48.630
<v Speaker 4>pull up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of those.</v>

929
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.080
<v Speaker 4>Darpa robot does is actually a new </v>
<v Speaker 4>version that just came out.</v>

930
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:54.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at it right now on the Darpa</v>
<v Speaker 4>website.</v>

931
00:44:54.331 --> 00:44:58.020
<v Speaker 4>It is horrific sound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes that kind of Hell's squeals and</v>

932
00:44:58.021 --> 00:44:58.380
<v Speaker 4>it makes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this thing is terrifying.</v>

934
00:45:02.801 --> 00:45:04.930
<v Speaker 4>It goes up hill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

935
00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:10.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at this video before Brian </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulls it up and it doesn't even seem </v>

936
00:45:10.391 --> 00:45:12.130
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like CGI.</v>

937
00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:16.690
<v Speaker 4>This thing is walking up hills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can negotiate over rocks and terraces</v>

938
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.840
<v Speaker 4>and it's built like a bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think they could make that the </v>

939
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:21.840
<v Speaker 4>size of a bus?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

940
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:21.840
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they could.</v>

941
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.620
<v Speaker 4>Darpa legged squad support system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How'd you get to that video?</v>

942
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:30.550
<v Speaker 4>I went to Darpa.com</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then what'd you click on Darpa?</v>

943
00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:35.700
<v Speaker 4>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a little image of it all right </v>

944
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.671
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see in the lower right hand corner </v>

945
00:45:38.671 --> 00:45:40.360
<v Speaker 4>and then the lower left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a dog running at Ya.</v>

946
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:41.590
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Click on that.</v>

947
00:45:41.591 --> 00:45:44.710
<v Speaker 4>I love the way you figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>embed advertising into your podcasts.</v>

948
00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.330
<v Speaker 4>We know you're sponsored by Darpa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>

949
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:47.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sponsored by robot dogs.</v>

950
00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:50.380
<v Speaker 4>You can't buy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't even make sense.</v>

951
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:55.970
<v Speaker 4>Would it use coupon code Rogan at Darpa?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this fucking thing,</v>

952
00:45:56.651 --> 00:45:59.650
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like the giant robot bowl.</v>

953
00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:04.600
<v Speaker 4>Imagine this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had machine guns and then rocket ports.</v>

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:11.340
<v Speaker 4>This things coming over the hill.</v>

<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of those things is coming over the </v>

956
00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:14.570
<v Speaker 4>hill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>300 of those things coming over.</v>

957
00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:19.400
<v Speaker 4>They build one of these motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They they're going to build a million </v>

958
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.440
<v Speaker 4>pound of 300 of those things at once is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the last thing.</v>

959
00:46:20.441 --> 00:46:24.250
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people are going to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This music has creeped me out.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And when you combine that with those </v>

979
00:47:26.521 --> 00:47:29.821
<v Speaker 4>quadra copters man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not just that the quadra copters </v>

980
00:47:29.821 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 4>and if you ever have you seen that </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

981
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:33.040
<v Speaker 4>they can jump off of buildings and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>just.</v>

982
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:35.020
<v Speaker 4>That alone is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That thing is.</v>

983
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:39.100
<v Speaker 4>That thing is horrendous that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>robot dog,</v>

984
00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:44.160
<v Speaker 4>a giant robot dog that can house </v>
<v Speaker 4>missiles and anything you want to </v>

985
00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.770
<v Speaker 4>fucking anything you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those things would probably super </v>

986
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:50.731
<v Speaker 4>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can carry all sorts of metal </v>

987
00:47:50.731 --> 00:47:52.801
<v Speaker 4>fucking things that kill people on them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they look like they look like they </v>

988
00:47:52.801 --> 00:47:54.110
<v Speaker 4>weren't going to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That just looked like it wasn't going to</v>

989
00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:59.120
<v Speaker 4>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like you couldn't get away </v>

990
00:47:59.120 --> 00:47:59.120
<v Speaker 4>from them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would never stopped at.</v>

991
00:47:59.120 --> 00:47:59.120
<v Speaker 4>Keep coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

992
00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:03.431
<v Speaker 4>and even if they did stop a repair swarm</v>
<v Speaker 4>of quadric opters would come down and </v>

993
00:48:03.431 --> 00:48:03.431
<v Speaker 4>fix it.</v>

994
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.700
<v Speaker 4>You're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not gonna.</v>

995
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:10.710
<v Speaker 4>You can't beat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not gonna be able to beat that </v>

996
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:13.051
<v Speaker 4>kind of technology and mass that scale </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is just as frightening almost as an</v>

997
00:48:13.241 --> 00:48:17.000
<v Speaker 4>atomic bomb because it's just as </v>
<v Speaker 4>heartless and cold and it's just.</v>

998
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:21.330
<v Speaker 4>It's going to do what someone said that </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone has to do is press the button,</v>

999
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.010
<v Speaker 4>send it out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they sort of alleviate themselves of</v>

1000
00:48:24.011 --> 00:48:29.011
<v Speaker 4>any responsibility because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>robot that's going to go in there and </v>

1001
00:48:29.011 --> 00:48:31.861
<v Speaker 4>fuck things up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also there's this ridiculous notion </v>

1002
00:48:31.861 --> 00:48:36.391
<v Speaker 4>that humans still seem to have that </v>
<v Speaker 4>these computers are never going to </v>

1003
00:48:36.391 --> 00:48:36.850
<v Speaker 4>become autonomous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

1004
00:48:36.851 --> 00:48:37.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1005
00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:42.850
<v Speaker 4>at one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every single programmer that has ever </v>

1006
00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:47.130
<v Speaker 4>made anything that you use on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer has had to contemplate where </v>

1007
00:48:47.141 --> 00:48:49.220
<v Speaker 4>the fuck that's going?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where the fuck the,</v>

1008
00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:52.960
<v Speaker 4>the anybody who's talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>artificial intelligence,</v>

1009
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:58.020
<v Speaker 4>anyone is talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all say it's going to get too </v>

1010
00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:58.020
<v Speaker 4>upset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The important.</v>

1011
00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:58.020
<v Speaker 4>They all say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's almost like we don't.</v>

1012
00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:01.030
<v Speaker 4>We're like little kids that have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>credit card and we're just going to keep</v>

1013
00:49:01.031 --> 00:49:03.520
<v Speaker 4>running up the bill until the check </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes and then we're going to go,</v>

1014
00:49:03.521 --> 00:49:04.540
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do we pay this?</v>

1015
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:05.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what have we done?</v>

1016
00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:08.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're fucked.</v>

1017
00:49:08.081 --> 00:49:09.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're gonna.</v>

1018
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:14.190
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna create this artificial thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is way fucking smarter than us and </v>

1019
00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:17.130
<v Speaker 4>realizes how gross we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that thing that's on the sheet a</v>

1020
00:49:17.131 --> 00:49:18.910
<v Speaker 4>robot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes up to 28 miles.</v>

1021
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.660
<v Speaker 3>Look at that thing going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

1022
00:49:22.661 --> 00:49:26.920
<v Speaker 3>that's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is fucking terrifying.</v>

1023
00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looking at Komen,</v>

1024
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:35.190
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>25 miles an hour running after you </v>

1025
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:36.520
<v Speaker 3>imagine 200 of those running down hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1026
00:49:36.521 --> 00:49:38.790
<v Speaker 3>It's not just one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just don't unleash one name.</v>

1027
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:40.720
<v Speaker 3>Only sworn in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have.</v>

1028
00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:41.770
<v Speaker 3>They're covered in</v>

1029
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:47.600
<v Speaker 4>machetes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can Be like a transformer can be bad at </v>

1030
00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:47.880
<v Speaker 4>Weiss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone hates underneath.</v>

1031
00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They found out that cutting things apart</v>

1032
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:55.190
<v Speaker 4>is cheaper than shooting missiles and </v>
<v Speaker 4>guarantee they're going to have drones </v>

1033
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.800
<v Speaker 4>that can figure out how to turn human </v>
<v Speaker 4>blood and the energy.</v>

1034
00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:59.400
<v Speaker 4>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just weird to me that you know that</v>

1035
00:49:59.401 --> 00:50:01.710
<v Speaker 4>this is all happening inside of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

1036
00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:06.770
<v Speaker 4>that this is all going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we really are seeing robots that </v>

1037
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:10.011
<v Speaker 4>can run 25 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We really are seeing drones shoot </v>

1038
00:50:10.011 --> 00:50:10.800
<v Speaker 4>missiles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it seems like some shit from a</v>

1039
00:50:10.801 --> 00:50:15.801
<v Speaker 4>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's really happening right now and </v>

1040
00:50:15.801 --> 00:50:17.850
<v Speaker 4>there really are people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>programming computers and programming,</v>

1041
00:50:17.851 --> 00:50:20.280
<v Speaker 4>artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they really are going to get it to a</v>

1042
00:50:20.281 --> 00:50:23.340
<v Speaker 4>point where it can think for itself and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there really are going to get to a point</v>

1043
00:50:23.341 --> 00:50:27.740
<v Speaker 4>where it can make its own decisions and </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it can decide to improve itself.</v>

1044
00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:32.710
<v Speaker 7>Auto bots doing this is really happening</v>
<v Speaker 7>in our life.</v>

1045
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:38.080
<v Speaker 7>We really might be in this glory day </v>
<v Speaker 7>before the scene and the terminator.</v>

1046
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.390
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's that,</v>

1047
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:45.550
<v Speaker 7>that it's within the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 7>possibility of robots do become sentient</v>

1048
00:50:45.581 --> 00:50:47.210
<v Speaker 7>and then especially if they need more </v>
<v Speaker 7>power,</v>

1049
00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:52.860
<v Speaker 6>the question is the type of singularity </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not if the singularity is going </v>

1050
00:50:53.321 --> 00:50:55.840
<v Speaker 6>to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the type of singularity that happens</v>

1051
00:50:55.841 --> 00:51:00.841
<v Speaker 6>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The big question is an advanced </v>

1052
00:51:00.841 --> 00:51:02.770
<v Speaker 6>intelligence that we made machines that </v>
<v Speaker 6>becomes autonomous.</v>

1053
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:08.670
<v Speaker 6>Are they going to view us as just a </v>
<v Speaker 6>waste of time and just decide to wipe us</v>

1054
00:51:08.891 --> 00:51:13.891
<v Speaker 6>out or.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that the other alternative is </v>

1055
00:51:13.891 --> 00:51:17.341
<v Speaker 6>far more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are they going to see that we're a </v>

1056
00:51:17.341 --> 00:51:19.741
<v Speaker 6>resource in the same way?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they would probably see everything </v>

1057
00:51:19.741 --> 00:51:22.090
<v Speaker 6>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a bit of information that they could use</v>

1058
00:51:22.091 --> 00:51:27.091
<v Speaker 6>to transform and create whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing is that they've decided is a more </v>

1059
00:51:27.091 --> 00:51:29.230
<v Speaker 6>perfect universe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think it's more likely that they're</v>

1060
00:51:29.231 --> 00:51:34.231
<v Speaker 6>going to assimilate with us than it is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that they would just chop as to bits </v>

1061
00:51:34.231 --> 00:51:35.980
<v Speaker 6>because we are rudimentary bio </v>
<v Speaker 6>computers.</v>

1062
00:51:35.981 --> 00:51:38.770
<v Speaker 6>They certainly are gonna have some use.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1063
00:51:38.771 --> 00:51:42.630
<v Speaker 6>I think that I think it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>more about connectivity than destroying.</v>

1064
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:47.830
<v Speaker 7>Well the real issue is how do you </v>
<v Speaker 7>program into an artificially intelligent</v>

1065
00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:53.021
<v Speaker 7>being the need to improve or the desire </v>
<v Speaker 7>to improve or the need to progress.</v>

1066
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:59.110
<v Speaker 7>It's like just because something is </v>
<v Speaker 7>intelligent and capable of incredible </v>

1067
00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:03.791
<v Speaker 7>things and capable of thinking on its </v>
<v Speaker 7>own doesn't mean it's going to have </v>

1068
00:52:03.791 --> 00:52:07.121
<v Speaker 7>those human style ambitions that allow </v>
<v Speaker 7>us or cause us to make like a lot of the</v>

1069
00:52:07.731 --> 00:52:12.731
<v Speaker 7>things that we make,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the things that we make we make because </v>

1070
00:52:12.731 --> 00:52:16.271
<v Speaker 7>of this weird competitive drive that we </v>
<v Speaker 7>have because of this weird desire to </v>

1071
00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:21.950
<v Speaker 7>innovate and improve and create things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These are like characteristics that have</v>

1072
00:52:21.951 --> 00:52:26.951
<v Speaker 7>led us to not be monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They've lead us away from the lower </v>

1073
00:52:26.951 --> 00:52:31.061
<v Speaker 7>hominids and we don't know that a </v>
<v Speaker 7>computer would have these </v>

1074
00:52:31.061 --> 00:52:35.890
<v Speaker 7>characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these characteristics that lead people </v>

1075
00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Speaker 7>to work all day and busted her ass and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1076
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:41.510
<v Speaker 7>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in acquiring material goods and be a </v>

1077
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.510
<v Speaker 7>baller and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Those,</v>

1078
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.960
<v Speaker 7>there's a weird instinct,</v>

1079
00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:45.780
<v Speaker 6>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the what if those instincts inside of us</v>

1080
00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:51.140
<v Speaker 6>are not just inside of us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but our manifestations of a kind of </v>

1081
00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:55.461
<v Speaker 6>evolutionary energy that's rolling </v>
<v Speaker 6>through time and as it rolls through </v>

1082
00:52:55.461 --> 00:52:59.961
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it gets more and more complex and more </v>

1083
00:52:59.961 --> 00:53:02.520
<v Speaker 6>and more harmonized.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which manifests in the form of evolution</v>

1084
00:53:02.521 --> 00:53:05.730
<v Speaker 6>in the form of single celled organisms </v>
<v Speaker 6>becoming multicell organisms all the way</v>

1085
00:53:05.731 --> 00:53:10.731
<v Speaker 6>up to us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is an actual energy that in the </v>

1086
00:53:10.731 --> 00:53:11.430
<v Speaker 6>same way wind blows through trees and </v>
<v Speaker 6>moves trees.</v>

1087
00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:14.820
<v Speaker 6>When this energy blows through the world</v>
<v Speaker 6>or through time,</v>

1088
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:18.990
<v Speaker 6>it causes things to wake up and connect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in that case,</v>

1089
00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.320
<v Speaker 6>whatever happens to be in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in that wind,</v>

1090
00:53:22.321 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 6>in that energy is going to just wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what it does.</v>

1091
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.890
<v Speaker 6>So in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not as though the computers need to</v>

1092
00:53:28.891 --> 00:53:33.891
<v Speaker 6>be programmed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they just need to be fine tuned enough </v>

1093
00:53:33.891 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 6>to start picking up that energy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And once they pick it up,</v>

1094
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:37.560
<v Speaker 6>that's when the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1095
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:38.250
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1096
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.260
<v Speaker 6>whatever this point is,</v>

1097
00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.980
<v Speaker 7>that's assuming that something that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>not natural.</v>

1098
00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.730
<v Speaker 7>Something that was created by life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not,</v>

1099
00:53:45.731 --> 00:53:50.731
<v Speaker 7>not born in a natural way is going to </v>
<v Speaker 7>inherit the same sort of desires to,</v>

1100
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:54.840
<v Speaker 7>to progress forward.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1101
00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:58.180
<v Speaker 7>I think that the universe certainly is </v>
<v Speaker 7>getting more and more complex.</v>

1102
00:53:58.181 --> 00:54:03.181
<v Speaker 7>Like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you look at the idea of the big bang </v>

1103
00:54:03.181 --> 00:54:04.630
<v Speaker 7>that's there was a single point smaller </v>
<v Speaker 7>than the head of a pin.</v>

1104
00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:07.510
<v Speaker 7>The giant explosion creates everything </v>
<v Speaker 7>we see in the sky today.</v>

1105
00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:12.960
<v Speaker 7>That just that alone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like then it has to cool down and then </v>

1106
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:16.081
<v Speaker 7>planets are formed and stars explode and</v>
<v Speaker 7>carbon based life forms based out of </v>

1107
00:54:16.081 --> 00:54:17.610
<v Speaker 7>star,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we have,</v>

1108
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:22.670
<v Speaker 7>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We literally have to have a star has to </v>

1109
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:25.111
<v Speaker 7>explode for you can make a person.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people don't really understand </v>

1110
00:54:25.111 --> 00:54:25.111
<v Speaker 7>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

1111
00:54:25.111 --> 00:54:29.410
<v Speaker 7>you look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just that idea that in that person might</v>

1112
00:54:29.411 --> 00:54:32.910
<v Speaker 7>very well one day harness the power to </v>
<v Speaker 7>make a star explodes.</v>

1113
00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:38.220
<v Speaker 7>I mean that person could,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you exponentially increase the rate </v>

1114
00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:42.400
<v Speaker 7>of our destructive capabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you look at like 19,</v>

1115
00:54:42.401 --> 00:54:45.160
<v Speaker 7>47 when they first,</v>
<v Speaker 7>was it 45,</v>

1116
00:54:45.161 --> 00:54:48.130
<v Speaker 7>47 when they perfected the atomic,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1117
00:54:48.131 --> 00:54:48.910
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the year,</v>

1118
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:54.150
<v Speaker 7>whatever year that is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>looked at as the forties and look at </v>

1119
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:56.880
<v Speaker 7>2012.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What they could do now destroy the </v>

1120
00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.771
<v Speaker 7>entire earth like 100 times over if </v>
<v Speaker 7>Russia and the United States and </v>

1121
00:54:58.771 --> 00:54:59.170
<v Speaker 7>Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everybody just launched their nukes.</v>

1122
00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:01.640
<v Speaker 7>Everybody launched.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Every nuke we've ever made was.</v>

1123
00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.280
<v Speaker 7>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It would be crazy.</v>

1124
00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:05.380
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it would be nothing left on the planet.</v>

1125
00:55:05.381 --> 00:55:07.090
<v Speaker 7>The whole planet would be done.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1126
00:55:07.091 --> 00:55:10.000
<v Speaker 7>if you extrapolate 100 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1127
00:55:10.001 --> 00:55:15.001
<v Speaker 7>200 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what kind of destructive anti-matter </v>

1128
00:55:15.001 --> 00:55:15.040
<v Speaker 7>weapons are we going to have?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then we're going to have star killers.</v>

1129
00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:15.730
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're,</v>

1130
00:55:15.731 --> 00:55:20.731
<v Speaker 7>we're most certainly going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 7>have the ability to erase things.</v>

1131
00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:23.340
<v Speaker 7>A race planets.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just gonna happen.</v>

1132
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:28.630
<v Speaker 6>What you made me think I've man is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've always thought that idea that we </v>

1133
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:33.051
<v Speaker 6>are star energy that's woken up because </v>
<v Speaker 6>the elements are the result of fusion </v>

1134
00:55:34.801 --> 00:55:39.801
<v Speaker 6>happening inside of stars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've always thought were eight </v>

1135
00:55:39.801 --> 00:55:44.270
<v Speaker 6>degradation of the energy of the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where are the energy getting weaker or </v>

1136
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:48.561
<v Speaker 6>weakening down?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But what if actually worst our energy </v>

1137
00:55:48.561 --> 00:55:52.850
<v Speaker 6>getting immensely more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Only the power is manifesting as </v>

1138
00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:55.110
<v Speaker 6>intelligence or consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1139
00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.100
<v Speaker 6>and what if the this destructive thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're talking about,</v>

1140
00:55:58.101 --> 00:56:01.810
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't come from weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but from innovation and,</v>

1141
00:56:01.811 --> 00:56:02.960
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is this,</v>

1142
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:05.130
<v Speaker 6>this is why I fucking love Kurzwell </v>
<v Speaker 6>because he's,</v>

1143
00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:10.340
<v Speaker 6>he talks about this idea that it gets to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the point where we begin to manipulate </v>

1144
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:16.011
<v Speaker 6>matter at the atomic level and this </v>
<v Speaker 6>somehow spreads out into space where,</v>

1145
00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:22.180
<v Speaker 6>where Nan Nan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>swarms of nanobots just fly through the </v>

1146
00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:25.641
<v Speaker 6>universe reconstructing matter according</v>
<v Speaker 6>the whims of whatever the overmanned is </v>

1147
00:56:25.691 --> 00:56:30.691
<v Speaker 6>or whatever the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the force of intelligence that is a </v>

1148
00:56:30.691 --> 00:56:34.111
<v Speaker 6>result of everything connecting is now </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's fucking a million times more </v>

1149
00:56:34.111 --> 00:56:36.490
<v Speaker 6>powerful than a star.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's something totally brand new.</v>

1150
00:56:36.491 --> 00:56:38.350
<v Speaker 6>It's like a novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Explosions.</v>

1151
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:43.890
<v Speaker 7>I think there's no doubt whatsoever that</v>
<v Speaker 7>people are probably very much like a lot</v>

1152
00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:49.171
<v Speaker 7>of other animals that create byproducts </v>
<v Speaker 7>without even understanding why they're </v>

1153
00:56:49.171 --> 00:56:49.171
<v Speaker 7>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1154
00:56:49.171 --> 00:56:54.060
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of bees making honey.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean they make honey to feed their </v>

1155
00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:54.760
<v Speaker 7>offspring of their.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're little,</v>

1156
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.070
<v Speaker 7>but they also pollinate flowers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They do,</v>

1157
00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:01.780
<v Speaker 7>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They do a lot of like weird tasks.</v>

1158
00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:06.930
<v Speaker 7>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they help things move along in </v>

1159
00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:09.220
<v Speaker 7>pollinating plants.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You really like help things move along,</v>

1160
00:57:09.221 --> 00:57:09.760
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You,</v>

1161
00:57:09.761 --> 00:57:10.240
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>

1162
00:57:10.241 --> 00:57:13.780
<v Speaker 7>you're aiding in the process I think are</v>
<v Speaker 7>crazy.</v>

1163
00:57:13.781 --> 00:57:18.781
<v Speaker 7>Need to acquire things is aiding in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>process of technological innovation at </v>

1164
00:57:18.781 --> 00:57:21.490
<v Speaker 7>the highest speed possible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's one of the reasons why it's</v>

1165
00:57:21.491 --> 00:57:24.730
<v Speaker 7>so compelling to get new phones and a </v>
<v Speaker 7>new laptop.</v>

1166
00:57:24.731 --> 00:57:26.560
<v Speaker 7>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you got the new laptop.</v>

1167
00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:27.550
<v Speaker 7>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let me see.</v>

1168
00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:30.250
<v Speaker 7>Look at that fucking screen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's sexual man.</v>

1169
00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:33.880
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's sexy as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can get a really dope phone.</v>

1170
00:57:33.881 --> 00:57:36.400
<v Speaker 7>You hold it and you scroll through it </v>
<v Speaker 7>and like it's.</v>

1171
00:57:36.401 --> 00:57:41.401
<v Speaker 7>There's something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's something alluring about that </v>

1172
00:57:41.401 --> 00:57:44.251
<v Speaker 7>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think our desire to continue to have </v>

1173
00:57:44.251 --> 00:57:44.770
<v Speaker 7>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 7>better,</v>

1174
00:57:44.771 --> 00:57:49.771
<v Speaker 7>badder,</v>
<v Speaker 7>faster or more awesome or I think that </v>

1175
00:57:49.771 --> 00:57:52.681
<v Speaker 7>is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the number one thing that's </v>

1176
00:57:52.681 --> 00:57:55.591
<v Speaker 7>pushing innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The number one thing that's pushing </v>

1177
00:57:55.591 --> 00:57:58.381
<v Speaker 7>technology is this desire for all these </v>
<v Speaker 7>new objects and as that technology gets </v>

1178
00:57:58.381 --> 00:58:03.120
<v Speaker 7>pushed further and further and further,</v>
<v Speaker 7>more becomes possible until you really </v>

1179
00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:07.501
<v Speaker 7>develop reality changing technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean the atomic bomb is essentially a </v>

1180
00:58:08.501 --> 00:58:09.970
<v Speaker 7>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Changing technology.</v>

1181
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:13.030
<v Speaker 7>Electricity is reality.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Changing the Internet's reality.</v>

1182
00:58:13.031 --> 00:58:18.031
<v Speaker 7>Change is d reality changed for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's essentially inevitable.</v>

1183
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.570
<v Speaker 7>It's like it's going to keep going and </v>
<v Speaker 7>going and going.</v>

1184
00:58:22.571 --> 00:58:27.571
<v Speaker 7>As long as the humans don't blow </v>
<v Speaker 7>themselves up with one of their reality </v>

1185
00:58:27.571 --> 00:58:30.481
<v Speaker 7>changing things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're going to come up with something </v>

1186
00:58:30.481 --> 00:58:32.851
<v Speaker 7>like a time machine come up with </v>
<v Speaker 7>something like some sort of a </v>

1187
00:58:32.851 --> 00:58:33.160
<v Speaker 7>transportation device or transport or a </v>
<v Speaker 7>beamer.</v>

1188
00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:38.330
<v Speaker 7>They're going to be able to scramble </v>
<v Speaker 7>your fucking cells and reconstruct them </v>

1189
00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:38.330
<v Speaker 7>on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1190
00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:39.580
<v Speaker 7>they're gonna be able to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 7>they want eventually.</v>

1191
00:58:39.581 --> 00:58:44.581
<v Speaker 7>If if time keeps going on and people </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't get killed by asteroids or blow </v>

1192
00:58:44.581 --> 00:58:46.210
<v Speaker 7>themselves up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just inevitable.</v>

1193
00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:49.860
<v Speaker 6>It's an inevitability for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's inevitable and you can kind of feel</v>

1194
00:58:49.861 --> 00:58:52.440
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I know it sounds so stupid,</v>

1195
00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:56.040
<v Speaker 6>but whenever I fucking go without </v>
<v Speaker 6>playing a video game for a long time and</v>

1196
00:58:56.041 --> 00:59:00.660
<v Speaker 6>buy a brand new video game and play it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it really fills me with a kind of.</v>

1197
00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:05.520
<v Speaker 6>I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's kind of ominous and how amazing</v>

1198
00:59:05.521 --> 00:59:07.320
<v Speaker 6>they are getting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how potent they are getting.</v>

1199
00:59:07.321 --> 00:59:09.420
<v Speaker 6>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You used to talk about this,</v>

1200
00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:14.540
<v Speaker 6>how our nervous systems might not be </v>
<v Speaker 6>built for the massive amounts of sense </v>

1201
00:59:15.481 --> 00:59:20.481
<v Speaker 6>gratification that are accessible </v>
<v Speaker 6>through technology and we it hijacks </v>

1202
00:59:20.481 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 6>your reward system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Borderlands two,</v>

1203
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.790
<v Speaker 6>I just started playing this game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit Man.</v>

1204
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:29.210
<v Speaker 6>It's such a perfect game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not just like graphics wise,</v>

1205
00:59:29.211 --> 00:59:34.211
<v Speaker 6>which are really trippy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of like heavy metal magazine </v>

1206
00:59:34.211 --> 00:59:36.731
<v Speaker 6>trippy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like the game itself is the first </v>

1207
00:59:36.731 --> 00:59:36.770
<v Speaker 6>game that's ever made me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of funny.</v>

1208
00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:42.040
<v Speaker 6>They've added a weird humor to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get good voiceover actors and it's </v>

1209
00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:46.001
<v Speaker 6>super violent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's so narcotic that it's really </v>

1210
00:59:47.631 --> 00:59:50.240
<v Speaker 6>makes me understand that this technology</v>
<v Speaker 6>is a drug.</v>

1211
00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:53.120
<v Speaker 6>It's a drug that they haven't identified</v>
<v Speaker 6>yet as a drug,</v>

1212
00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:56.360
<v Speaker 6>but it's a fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's exactly like any other drug.</v>

1213
00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:59.800
<v Speaker 6>Well maybe not even like any other drug </v>
<v Speaker 6>like heroin it.</v>

1214
00:59:59.830 --> 00:59:59.990
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1215
01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.930
<v Speaker 1>porn is also a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1216
01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the immediate access to porn </v>

1217
01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:07.260
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a drug.</v>

1218
01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no question about it.</v>

1219
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:14.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching and Dr drew episode the </v>

1220
01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:15.110
<v Speaker 1>other day where there's a dude who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted to porn.</v>

1221
01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Fucking fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating looking at this guy and his </v>

1222
01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:23.681
<v Speaker 1>wife and you know them trying to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>out intimacy again because this guy was </v>

1223
01:00:23.681 --> 01:00:26.930
<v Speaker 1>just fucking completely whacked off on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat it off to to check some online.</v>

1224
01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:28.950
<v Speaker 6>It's a man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a pull.</v>

1225
01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.040
<v Speaker 6>It's like a technology has a gravity and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you and it's a gravity that doesn't </v>

1226
01:00:34.711 --> 01:00:37.980
<v Speaker 6>operate on mass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It operates on a tension,</v>

1227
01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:41.190
<v Speaker 6>so when you're around technology,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can feel it.</v>

1228
01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:46.310
<v Speaker 6>Drawing your attention into it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the thing you were talking about with </v>

1229
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:47.130
<v Speaker 6>your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with porn,</v>

1230
01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.500
<v Speaker 6>with TV,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with your car,</v>

1231
01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:51.690
<v Speaker 6>you're fucking new car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whatever it is,</v>

1232
01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:56.870
<v Speaker 6>it pulls at your mind in this very </v>
<v Speaker 6>obvious way that's impossible to deny </v>

1233
01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:03.540
<v Speaker 6>and that that energy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is the beginning of the connection </v>

1234
01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.530
<v Speaker 6>that machines are making with our </v>
<v Speaker 6>neurology.</v>

1235
01:01:04.531 --> 01:01:07.590
<v Speaker 6>That's the very first contact.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you feel that pole,</v>

1236
01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:12.860
<v Speaker 6>you're filling feeling the force of </v>
<v Speaker 6>technology linking into your nervous </v>

1237
01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:16.731
<v Speaker 6>system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're feeling an interface happen at a </v>

1238
01:01:16.731 --> 01:01:19.161
<v Speaker 6>very rudimentary level,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that interface is going to get more </v>

1239
01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:21.390
<v Speaker 6>and more focused,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more and more advanced and more and more</v>

1240
01:01:21.391 --> 01:01:26.391
<v Speaker 6>perfect until it'll lock in for good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think people back in the day </v>

1241
01:01:26.611 --> 01:01:29.220
<v Speaker 6>though thought that about books like </v>
<v Speaker 6>when blood these books,</v>

1242
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:30.040
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're teaching us.</v>

1243
01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know when they first </v>

1244
01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:36.400
<v Speaker 1>invented printing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that held Islam</v>

1245
01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:39.880
<v Speaker 1>back was that they didn't allow it to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>printed with the typeset.</v>

1246
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>It was only allowed to be like written </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and there was a.</v>

1247
01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>It was a long time before they allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Koran to be printed.</v>

1248
01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

1249
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well fuck them up.</v>

1250
01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:57.240
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about relisted print </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the beginning of the devil and while</v>

1251
01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>they were in the same camp as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unabomber was a brilliant guy who they </v>

1252
01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.570
<v Speaker 1>whacked out with Lsd Studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1253
01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I think there's no question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have some bizarre attraction to </v>

1254
01:02:11.111 --> 01:02:16.111
<v Speaker 1>technology and there's no question that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not set up to handle that type of </v>

1255
01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>sensory overload that they provide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where when</v>

1256
01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:23.070
<v Speaker 7>when a guy goes on a screen and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>know,</v>

1257
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:28.160
<v Speaker 7>and his fucking face is 60 feet high and</v>
<v Speaker 7>he says the perfect shit because there's</v>

1258
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:32.640
<v Speaker 7>a team of writers who spent weeks going </v>
<v Speaker 7>over his dialogue with a fine tooth comb</v>

1259
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:36.540
<v Speaker 7>and his music.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's music playing when he's talking.</v>

1260
01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.930
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's the impact is pretty fucking</v>
<v Speaker 7>intense.</v>

1261
01:02:39.931 --> 01:02:42.240
<v Speaker 7>The hero impact that you get from a </v>
<v Speaker 7>movie.</v>

1262
01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.700
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's if you could,</v>

1263
01:02:44.701 --> 01:02:47.390
<v Speaker 7>if you could take someone from the 15 </v>
<v Speaker 7>hundreds and and,</v>

1264
01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:50.760
<v Speaker 7>and bring them to a movie theater and </v>
<v Speaker 7>get them to watch like Avatar.</v>

1265
01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.150
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they would shriek in horror.</v>

1266
01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:58.230
<v Speaker 7>They would cry and scream.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They would be weeping and fascination.</v>

1267
01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.180
<v Speaker 7>They wouldn't believe what they were </v>
<v Speaker 7>saying.</v>

1268
01:03:00.181 --> 01:03:05.181
<v Speaker 7>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They would think that they were in the </v>

1269
01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:06.531
<v Speaker 7>presence of God himself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you played a movie and God was in a </v>

1270
01:03:06.531 --> 01:03:09.330
<v Speaker 7>fucking robe and old man and a robe can </v>
<v Speaker 7>make magic shit happen,</v>

1271
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.630
<v Speaker 7>and you showed on the screen God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like making things happen,</v>

1272
01:03:12.631 --> 01:03:15.270
<v Speaker 7>all kinds of crazy special effects.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They would buy it,</v>

1273
01:03:15.271 --> 01:03:20.271
<v Speaker 7>hook,</v>
<v Speaker 7>line and sinker 100 percent because it </v>

1274
01:03:20.271 --> 01:03:21.630
<v Speaker 7>would be beyond the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 7>imagination.</v>

1275
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.830
<v Speaker 7>It'd be completely beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the question is,</v>

1276
01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.680
<v Speaker 7>my thing was that were setup like that </v>
<v Speaker 7>guy though our biology is like that guy,</v>

1277
01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:33.770
<v Speaker 7>our biology hasn't changed,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but what we introduced to it on a </v>

1278
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.870
<v Speaker 7>regular basis has changed significantly.</v>

1279
01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:38.930
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's getting and it's getting more and </v>

1280
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:38.930
<v Speaker 6>more powerful every day and it induces a</v>
<v Speaker 6>trance state.</v>

1281
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:43.710
<v Speaker 6>And so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are we like when we're not in a </v>

1282
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:44.500
<v Speaker 6>trance state?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does that look like?</v>

1283
01:03:44.501 --> 01:03:48.220
<v Speaker 6>Because I don't know if you're without </v>
<v Speaker 6>your phone for an hour,</v>

1284
01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.070
<v Speaker 6>you feel a little weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you forget your phone at your,</v>

1285
01:03:51.071 --> 01:03:56.071
<v Speaker 6>at you feel weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So because the state of consciousness </v>

1286
01:03:56.071 --> 01:03:56.740
<v Speaker 6>that we're in now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have become dependent on the machine.</v>

1287
01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:00.760
<v Speaker 6>The machine has become part of us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what is,</v>

1288
01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.450
<v Speaker 6>what are we like outside of that trance </v>
<v Speaker 6>state,</v>

1289
01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.070
<v Speaker 6>outside of that stupor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What uh,</v>

1290
01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:11.080
<v Speaker 6>what are we like when our consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 6>or our attention isn't getting drawn </v>

1291
01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.780
<v Speaker 6>into some glowing screen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And before that,</v>

1292
01:04:13.781 --> 01:04:18.781
<v Speaker 6>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our consciousness like when it's not </v>

1293
01:04:18.781 --> 01:04:19.390
<v Speaker 6>being drawn into a book or a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is there a pure state or.</v>

1294
01:04:19.391 --> 01:04:22.990
<v Speaker 6>We always like constantly in relation to</v>
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

1295
01:04:23.170 --> 01:04:28.170
<v Speaker 6>Is there a way that you're not in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>trance or are you always consistently </v>

1296
01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:30.490
<v Speaker 6>connecting with some symbols structure </v>
<v Speaker 6>out there,</v>

1297
01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:31.780
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1298
01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:37.210
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>unless you live in the woods and go </v>

1299
01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:38.930
<v Speaker 7>offline for a while and you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>connecting in one tiny bit,</v>

1300
01:04:38.931 --> 01:04:41.070
<v Speaker 7>you mean it's like you have your finger </v>
<v Speaker 7>on home base,</v>

1301
01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:44.090
<v Speaker 7>you're scared to run away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're safe,</v>

1302
01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.740
<v Speaker 7>you're safe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You get your finger on home base.</v>

1303
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:51.010
<v Speaker 7>How many times have you been at a </v>
<v Speaker 7>restaurant and you're looking at your </v>

1304
01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:51.010
<v Speaker 7>phone?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just compelling.</v>

1305
01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:51.010
<v Speaker 7>You check,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can check it,</v>

1306
01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:51.290
<v Speaker 7>check,</v>
<v Speaker 7>check,</v>

1307
01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:52.870
<v Speaker 7>check,</v>
<v Speaker 7>check.</v>

1308
01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.910
<v Speaker 7>Using link that you can use.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you don't check your twitter.</v>

1309
01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.220
<v Speaker 6>Endless.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's endless.</v>

1310
01:04:57.221 --> 01:04:57.630
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1311
01:04:57.631 --> 01:04:59.260
<v Speaker 6>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1312
01:04:59.261 --> 01:05:00.460
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I will admit,</v>

1313
01:05:00.461 --> 01:05:02.110
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm addicted to the Internet.</v>

1314
01:05:02.111 --> 01:05:05.200
<v Speaker 6>There's no question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My behavior is addictive behavior.</v>

1315
01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:07.360
<v Speaker 6>I am addicted to information.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love it.</v>

1316
01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:10.990
<v Speaker 6>I love every weird little fucking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1317
01:05:10.991 --> 01:05:13.870
<v Speaker 6>The fact that I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1318
01:05:13.871 --> 01:05:17.020
<v Speaker 6>the amazing leopard attack video that </v>
<v Speaker 6>came out today,</v>

1319
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:17.230
<v Speaker 6>or</v>

1320
01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.270
<v Speaker 3>what is the video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a leopard in a gorilla.</v>

1321
01:05:19.271 --> 01:05:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Is that okay?</v>

1322
01:05:19.850 --> 01:05:20.880
<v Speaker 6>It's a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

1323
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:26.280
<v Speaker 6>it's a leopard leaping it something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I was on the fucking airplane and </v>

1324
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:26.280
<v Speaker 6>couldn't watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I try.</v>

1325
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.240
<v Speaker 6>I spent 30 minutes trying to watch that </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking thing just because I was so </v>

1326
01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.620
<v Speaker 6>interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when you consider that 10 years ago,</v>

1327
01:05:32.621 --> 01:05:37.621
<v Speaker 6>15 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you wanted to see something like </v>

1328
01:05:37.621 --> 01:05:40.261
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd have to be sitting in front of a </v>

1329
01:05:40.261 --> 01:05:40.261
<v Speaker 6>big ass TV and before that if you wanted</v>
<v Speaker 6>to see something like that,</v>

1330
01:05:40.261 --> 01:05:42.790
<v Speaker 6>you'd have to go out in the woods and </v>
<v Speaker 6>find it to see it.</v>

1331
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.780
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1332
01:05:43.781 --> 01:05:44.620
<v Speaker 6>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1333
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:49.630
<v Speaker 6>the things that we are witnessing as </v>
<v Speaker 6>human beings in this time period or </v>

1334
01:05:49.631 --> 01:05:54.631
<v Speaker 6>things that most human beings in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>past would see one of them in their </v>

1335
01:05:54.631 --> 01:05:55.780
<v Speaker 6>entire lives if that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if that.</v>

1336
01:05:56.380 --> 01:06:00.640
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that these things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out as constantly all the time.</v>

1337
01:06:00.641 --> 01:06:05.110
<v Speaker 1>So our senses are just on overload.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a 100 percent overload.</v>

1338
01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't,</v>

1339
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
<v Speaker 1>we don't have the ability to process </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not those rewards are being </v>

1340
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.260
<v Speaker 1>utilized in a natural manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

1341
01:06:14.261 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 1>it's like a parasite system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the story of that,</v>

1342
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:22.561
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aquatic worms that infects the </v>

1343
01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:24.730
<v Speaker 1>grasshopper and literally talks the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasshopper into committing suicide,</v>

1344
01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:27.670
<v Speaker 1>just gets inside of its brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells it what to do.</v>

1345
01:06:27.671 --> 01:06:29.830
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then hatch's Brian,</v>

1346
01:06:29.831 --> 01:06:34.120
<v Speaker 1>if you pull up an animal face off </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla versus leopard,</v>

1347
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that's what technology is </v>

1348
01:06:39.521 --> 01:06:44.521
<v Speaker 1>doing with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's sort of embedded itself </v>

1349
01:06:44.521 --> 01:06:45.400
<v Speaker 1>slowly but surely into our system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more and more,</v>

1350
01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:48.460
<v Speaker 1>it's getting to the point where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't function without it.</v>

1351
01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:49.020
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

1352
01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:54.740
<v Speaker 6>beyond that point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you know the thing where they talk </v>

1353
01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:57.570
<v Speaker 6>about if the sun solar flares do much </v>
<v Speaker 6>and knocks out all the GPS satellites,</v>

1354
01:06:57.571 --> 01:07:01.650
<v Speaker 6>the havoc it'll wreak on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's way past the point of no return.</v>

1355
01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:06.651
<v Speaker 6>We've got to have the connection.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We must have it for our society to work </v>

1356
01:07:06.651 --> 01:07:10.701
<v Speaker 6>for trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to deliver food for fucking nuclear </v>

1357
01:07:10.701 --> 01:07:12.300
<v Speaker 6>plants to work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If this shit shuts down,</v>

1358
01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.100
<v Speaker 6>you know and shit</v>

1359
01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:16.310
<v Speaker 3>on the ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1360
01:07:16.311 --> 01:07:18.740
<v Speaker 3>you got to fast forward quite a bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>before the actual action.</v>

1361
01:07:18.741 --> 01:07:23.741
<v Speaker 3>That's fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was an artificial leopard.</v>

1362
01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Look at these fucking through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are real.</v>

1363
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:32.770
<v Speaker 3>They're having fights in the trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a scary ass animal.</v>

1364
01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:37.250
<v Speaker 3>Leopards are scary too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're there.</v>

1365
01:07:37.251 --> 01:07:39.510
<v Speaker 3>They're really quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The arms can you do.</v>

1366
01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:41.770
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen this guerrilla fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>elaborate.</v>

1367
01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:44.720
<v Speaker 3>These gorillas duking it out to shake </v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

1368
01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.730
<v Speaker 3>We have that leverage is jack and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolute.</v>

1369
01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy.</v>

1370
01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:53.860
<v Speaker 3>The senses are as sharp as our size of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that fucking thing could keep the </v>

1371
01:07:54.081 --> 01:07:58.520
<v Speaker 3>leopard and edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say gorilla would when I say,</v>

1372
01:07:58.570 --> 01:07:59.510
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

1373
01:07:59.570 --> 01:08:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Predict who will win only to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

1374
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:08.090
<v Speaker 3>I wish animals have police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The grill might.</v>

1375
01:08:08.091 --> 01:08:13.091
<v Speaker 3>When they look pretty fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The grill might just rip that thing </v>

1376
01:08:13.091 --> 01:08:13.091
<v Speaker 3>apart in our scenario of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1377
01:08:13.091 --> 01:08:14.900
<v Speaker 3>this is a scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sons of bitches,</v>

1378
01:08:14.901 --> 01:08:18.310
<v Speaker 3>so this is all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just ones that are real though,</v>

1379
01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:19.320
<v Speaker 3>isn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1380
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:24.750
<v Speaker 3>this is so dumb in our scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our crap.</v>

1381
01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like a bad video game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

1382
01:08:28.751 --> 01:08:33.751
<v Speaker 3>this is awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a video game for the eighties </v>

1383
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:39.390
<v Speaker 3>produce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what happens when the budget </v>

1384
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:39.390
<v Speaker 3>runs out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1385
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:44.131
<v Speaker 3>This isn't the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there another video or is this the </v>

1386
01:08:44.131 --> 01:08:44.131
<v Speaker 3>one you were talking about is awesome </v>
<v Speaker 3>because like.</v>

1387
01:08:46.650 --> 01:08:48.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

1388
01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:50.290
<v Speaker 3>This is 100 percent horseshit.</v>

1389
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:54.830
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there you go.</v>

1390
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:56.210
<v Speaker 6>You were addicted to watching that </v>
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>

1391
01:08:56.211 --> 01:08:57.770
<v Speaker 6>You really wanted to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It drew you in.</v>

1392
01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.350
<v Speaker 6>It was real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing man,</v>

1393
01:09:00.351 --> 01:09:05.351
<v Speaker 6>and it's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's like a lot of meditative </v>

1394
01:09:05.351 --> 01:09:07.811
<v Speaker 6>practice practices are all about like </v>
<v Speaker 6>developing your focus and developing </v>

1395
01:09:07.811 --> 01:09:12.041
<v Speaker 6>your will through developing your focus </v>
<v Speaker 6>and when your mind is getting pulled in </v>

1396
01:09:12.471 --> 01:09:17.471
<v Speaker 6>a million different directions by your </v>
<v Speaker 6>phone and by the computer and buy tv </v>

1397
01:09:17.471 --> 01:09:21.650
<v Speaker 6>than it really does seem like you are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like eating too much,</v>

1398
01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:23.560
<v Speaker 6>too many sweets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1399
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:26.960
<v Speaker 6>like you're some innate part of you is </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to start rotting.</v>

1400
01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:32.000
<v Speaker 6>You're gonna lose this really important </v>
<v Speaker 6>focus like men,</v>

1401
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:34.790
<v Speaker 6>you know when you get around someone </v>
<v Speaker 6>who's got real focus,</v>

1402
01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:40.120
<v Speaker 6>who's really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really figured out a way to pin to turn </v>

1403
01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:44.651
<v Speaker 6>their minds into a pinpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a laser fucking Tom cruise does it </v>

1404
01:09:44.651 --> 01:09:46.610
<v Speaker 6>from the scientology training.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever seen him?</v>

1405
01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:47.780
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when he gets,</v>

1406
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:50.440
<v Speaker 6>when he gets sprayed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so he gets to blow my hair.</v>

1407
01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:54.380
<v Speaker 6>I mean that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

1408
01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:55.880
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't be surprised.</v>

1409
01:09:55.881 --> 01:10:00.881
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure there's a lot of power in that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we're so distracted right now that </v>

1410
01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:03.230
<v Speaker 6>when you come across someone who's got </v>
<v Speaker 6>that kind of focus,</v>

1411
01:10:03.231 --> 01:10:05.960
<v Speaker 6>you almost feel like you're around </v>
<v Speaker 6>Dracula or something.</v>

1412
01:10:05.961 --> 01:10:09.590
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of creepy when someone's like </v>
<v Speaker 6>just tunes in salesmanship.</v>

1413
01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that would work on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

1414
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:16.590
<v Speaker 1>If you and Tom Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're alone in a room together and you </v>

1415
01:10:16.590 --> 01:10:18.390
<v Speaker 1>had a conversation with suck his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

1416
01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are alone in a room with him,</v>

1417
01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:27.150
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that he would appear </v>
<v Speaker 1>silly if we talked to them just for a </v>

1418
01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:27.150
<v Speaker 1>couple of hours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1419
01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:30.250
<v Speaker 1>He would be a silly person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like did you ever see him in Matt Lauer?</v>

1420
01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that.</v>

1421
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:36.350
<v Speaker 1>The conversation with a lady that got on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject of scientology and his </v>

1422
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:38.740
<v Speaker 1>criticism of Brooke shields taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants,</v>

1423
01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a fascinating dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1424
01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:44.170
<v Speaker 1>He would curl rumble like a house of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cards.</v>

1425
01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think he's charismatic?</v>

1426
01:10:46.271 --> 01:10:48.460
<v Speaker 1>I think he's only charismatic if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really dumb.</v>

1427
01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:53.700
<v Speaker 1>If you watch that video and you see like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he communicates when he talks </v>

1428
01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:53.700
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1429
01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:55.750
<v Speaker 1>match pink glum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're glum like,</v>

1430
01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:57.340
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a silly person.</v>

1431
01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1432
01:10:58.300 --> 01:10:59.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be protected.</v>

1433
01:10:59.790 --> 01:11:00.450
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he will.</v>

1434
01:11:00.451 --> 01:11:05.451
<v Speaker 6>He's got an entourage around him and </v>
<v Speaker 6>people who are probably better at </v>

1435
01:11:05.451 --> 01:11:05.451
<v Speaker 6>hypnotizing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but yeah,</v>

1436
01:11:05.451 --> 01:11:06.130
<v Speaker 6>as a brilliant actor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

1437
01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.470
<v Speaker 6>I don't think I get sucked in by that </v>
<v Speaker 6>from Tom Cruise,</v>

1438
01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:14.250
<v Speaker 6>but I think that what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but talking about Tom Cruise</v>

1439
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:14.810
<v Speaker 1>having this.</v>

1440
01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there's.</v>

1441
01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:18.320
<v Speaker 6>I think it's an example of people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is that?</v>

1442
01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.310
<v Speaker 6>Was that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we have video game tech Demo.</v>

1443
01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.270
<v Speaker 6>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's</v>

1444
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.960
<v Speaker 1>fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

1445
01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the facial features.</v>

1446
01:11:26.221 --> 01:11:30.690
<v Speaker 1>This guy is like making all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different facial features or a gestures.</v>

1447
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:33.360
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really weird.</v>

1448
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:38.390
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creepy and it's going to get going to </v>

1449
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:40.881
<v Speaker 1>get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be hard to kill people in </v>

1450
01:11:40.881 --> 01:11:40.881
<v Speaker 1>video games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna start feeling guilty.</v>

1451
01:11:40.881 --> 01:11:42.960
<v Speaker 1>This is the new real listening engine </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's supposed to look like a real,</v>

1452
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:48.050
<v Speaker 1>as realistic as it looks like a video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is quake like it looks like a </v>

1453
01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:48.510
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going down.</v>

1454
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.230
<v Speaker 1>That looks so realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you told me this is a real video,</v>

1455
01:11:52.231 --> 01:11:52.890
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1456
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:54.840
<v Speaker 1>that's a video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's got their iphone.</v>

1457
01:11:54.841 --> 01:11:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible,</v>

1458
01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:57.160
<v Speaker 1>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1459
01:11:57.210 --> 01:12:00.870
<v Speaker 1>my thing was I just don't think that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be impressed with his focus.</v>

1460
01:12:00.871 --> 01:12:03.060
<v Speaker 1>I think that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's only.</v>

1461
01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.840
<v Speaker 1>That's only when you see him in </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews and he puts on this thing and</v>

1462
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:09.390
<v Speaker 1>I think alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think that would be silly.</v>

1463
01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:10.170
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1464
01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:12.210
<v Speaker 6>I think I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll give you a list of people.</v>

1465
01:12:12.211 --> 01:12:13.650
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why I started with Tom </v>
<v Speaker 6>Cruise.</v>

1466
01:12:13.651 --> 01:12:16.740
<v Speaker 6>Probably a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you see that focus in.</v>

1467
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:21.030
<v Speaker 6>I'm like politicians a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like Obama's got it.</v>

1468
01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:26.240
<v Speaker 6>Even fucking Romney has this weird way </v>
<v Speaker 6>that he kind of does the heat seeking </v>

1469
01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.900
<v Speaker 6>missile lock in on people when they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking.</v>

1470
01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:33.150
<v Speaker 6>It's different from the way normal </v>
<v Speaker 6>people act and that level of focus comes</v>

1471
01:12:33.151 --> 01:12:36.990
<v Speaker 6>from being supremely disciplined in some</v>
<v Speaker 6>way or another.</v>

1472
01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:39.300
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's because you're having to,</v>

1473
01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:44.570
<v Speaker 6>as a politician,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you think about the level of </v>

1474
01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:44.570
<v Speaker 6>focus it takes for those guys during the</v>
<v Speaker 6>debates,</v>

1475
01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:46.170
<v Speaker 6>regardless of whether you liked them or </v>
<v Speaker 6>not.</v>

1476
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:51.470
<v Speaker 6>When you imagine that one misstep,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one each one wrong thing that you say is</v>

1477
01:12:52.861 --> 01:12:57.861
<v Speaker 6>going to get repeated like a strobe </v>
<v Speaker 6>light for the next week or perhaps could</v>

1478
01:12:57.961 --> 01:13:01.320
<v Speaker 6>ruin your chance at being president.</v>

1479
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.160
<v Speaker 6>That's an insane amount of pressure that</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're under and they've developed some</v>

1480
01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:10.161
<v Speaker 6>incredible focus that deal with it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I think is different than most </v>

1481
01:13:10.161 --> 01:13:10.860
<v Speaker 6>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1482
01:13:10.861 --> 01:13:12.690
<v Speaker 6>most people are scattered,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1483
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:17.870
<v Speaker 6>I eat dinner with people sometimes and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they can't go four minutes without </v>

1484
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:18.390
<v Speaker 6>checking their phone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1485
01:13:18.391 --> 01:13:20.880
<v Speaker 6>you just get used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You get used to this thing around people</v>

1486
01:13:20.881 --> 01:13:22.140
<v Speaker 6>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh yeah,</v>

1487
01:13:22.141 --> 01:13:24.510
<v Speaker 6>they're one of those people who always </v>
<v Speaker 6>check their phone.</v>

1488
01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.970
<v Speaker 6>Like I know during a conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 6>this person,</v>

1489
01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:30.180
<v Speaker 6>they're going to be constantly looking </v>
<v Speaker 6>at their phone,</v>

1490
01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:33.060
<v Speaker 6>irresistibly drawn to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the worst.</v>

1491
01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that they can't.</v>

1492
01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:37.200
<v Speaker 1>You can't lock in with them if they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a phone on them.</v>

1493
01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.170
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can't resist it.</v>

1494
01:13:39.530 --> 01:13:44.530
<v Speaker 6>They don't even know they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where it gets really creepy is where </v>

1495
01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:46.460
<v Speaker 6>your mid conversation with someone and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they just go down to the phone.</v>

1496
01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another dose.</v>

1497
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst is like there'll be in the </v>

1498
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.910
<v Speaker 1>middle of something and then it'll stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and start texting and you're like,</v>

1499
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:53.430
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we hanging out?</v>

1500
01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.460
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this really that important?</v>

1501
01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:59.270
<v Speaker 1>You're going to stop in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking like you stopped talking,</v>

1502
01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:04.690
<v Speaker 1>you started going hold on file.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's vitally,</v>

1503
01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.250
<v Speaker 1>it's silly because most of the time it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that important.</v>

1504
01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:10.780
<v Speaker 1>What could it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's most likely pussy.</v>

1505
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Some of that sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

1506
01:14:21.161 --> 01:14:23.140
<v Speaker 1>The robots are going to have no desire </v>
<v Speaker 1>for pussy,</v>

1507
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.960
<v Speaker 1>so how are these life forms can even get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of bed?</v>

1508
01:14:26.410 --> 01:14:28.960
<v Speaker 1>There's no no fucking reward system set </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1509
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I think that you are at being incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic thinking that robots are </v>

1510
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.600
<v Speaker 1>going to give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to pull the cord,</v>

1511
01:14:34.601 --> 01:14:39.601
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna realize how pointless life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is and before they ever get to recreate </v>

1512
01:14:39.601 --> 01:14:42.691
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to blow themselves </v>

1513
01:14:42.691 --> 01:14:42.691
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1514
01:14:42.691 --> 01:14:42.691
<v Speaker 1>The robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1515
01:14:42.691 --> 01:14:44.440
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna realize what's the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where robots would have souls ever.</v>

1516
01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Nothing got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just send 10 robot fucking circuits </v>

1517
01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:51.720
<v Speaker 1>going off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>switch flipping back and forth.</v>

1518
01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:54.370
<v Speaker 1>The singularity happens and they're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of depressed.</v>

1519
01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:59.430
<v Speaker 1>They're homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless robots because they have no </v>

1520
01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:02.040
<v Speaker 1>ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's and then we have to figure out </v>

1521
01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.751
<v Speaker 1>whether or not we want to put ambition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the robots because then they'll </v>

1522
01:15:03.751 --> 01:15:06.571
<v Speaker 1>surely take over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be a big dilemma to be a bunch </v>

1523
01:15:06.571 --> 01:15:06.571
<v Speaker 1>of more list or like we have to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>them ambition.</v>

1524
01:15:06.571 --> 01:15:07.810
<v Speaker 1>We gave them life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1525
01:15:07.811 --> 01:15:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be a real boy.</v>

1526
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very likely that they will </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no desire whatsoever.</v>

1527
01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:23.281
<v Speaker 1>Unless it's programmed into them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason for them to want to </v>

1528
01:15:23.281 --> 01:15:23.410
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason for them to want money</v>

1529
01:15:23.411 --> 01:15:24.810
<v Speaker 1>or a big house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're.</v>

1530
01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:29.820
<v Speaker 1>They're robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The what the fuck is the point in </v>

1531
01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.220
<v Speaker 1>advancing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the point in making more robots </v>

1532
01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:32.220
<v Speaker 1>like what are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the point of even being alive?</v>

1533
01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:34.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not going to be any reward.</v>

1534
01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:39.930
<v Speaker 1>The whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole like mo momentum that pushes </v>

1535
01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:44.650
<v Speaker 1>us towards all this technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation and towards progress is these</v>

1536
01:15:44.651 --> 01:15:49.651
<v Speaker 1>weird reward systems that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These reward systems are engineered by </v>

1537
01:15:49.651 --> 01:15:54.091
<v Speaker 1>the universe to ensure that we keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing forward and all of the these </v>

1538
01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:59.460
<v Speaker 1>reward systems are all like going after </v>
<v Speaker 1>these primal reward systems that have </v>

1539
01:16:01.061 --> 01:16:06.061
<v Speaker 1>been inside of us for like hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering and cold as a reward system </v>

1540
01:16:06.641 --> 01:16:07.890
<v Speaker 1>that it wants a common cold.</v>

1541
01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it.</v>

1542
01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Does it have ambition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it going for something?</v>

1543
01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:14.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just doing its thing.</v>

1544
01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know that we're not a cold.</v>

1545
01:16:17.261 --> 01:16:20.760
<v Speaker 1>We have actual were more complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but viruses,</v>

1546
01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:23.080
<v Speaker 1>computer viruses don't have ambition </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1547
01:16:23.081 --> 01:16:25.330
<v Speaker 1>They've just been coded to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1548
01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:27.690
<v Speaker 1>but they don't act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They react the.</v>

1549
01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:30.610
<v Speaker 1>When a computer virus gets into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

1550
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.760
<v Speaker 1>reacts to the fact that it can get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it moves forward.</v>

1551
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:35.620
<v Speaker 1>If this didn't get in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just stops.</v>

1552
01:16:35.621 --> 01:16:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This point here is like the beginning of</v>

1553
01:16:38.501 --> 01:16:43.400
<v Speaker 1>like an endless argument that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have because the point is do we act or,</v>

1554
01:16:43.401 --> 01:16:44.500
<v Speaker 1>or are we just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1555
01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.590
<v Speaker 1>my point was the computer viruses are </v>
<v Speaker 1>programmed to do things.</v>

1556
01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:49.420
<v Speaker 1>They're programmed to behave in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain way.</v>

1557
01:16:49.421 --> 01:16:54.421
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to go in if they can get past </v>

1558
01:16:54.421 --> 01:16:56.671
<v Speaker 1>step one to get in the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how a computer virus is </v>

1559
01:16:56.671 --> 01:17:01.431
<v Speaker 1>set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would have to make these computers </v>

1560
01:17:01.431 --> 01:17:04.860
<v Speaker 1>make these sentient beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to program them with some sort </v>

1561
01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:07.831
<v Speaker 1>of ambition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of desire to move forward </v>

1562
01:17:07.831 --> 01:17:07.831
<v Speaker 1>because if you didn't program them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1563
01:17:07.831 --> 01:17:09.620
<v Speaker 1>with an objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mandate,</v>

1564
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.590
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they would just be intelligent just</v>

1565
01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:17.591
<v Speaker 1>because they're intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reward system for them to </v>

1566
01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:18.650
<v Speaker 1>want to make a new nuclear reactor.</v>

1567
01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:19.610
<v Speaker 6>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>

1568
01:17:19.611 --> 01:17:24.611
<v Speaker 6>it's like you're creating a situation </v>
<v Speaker 6>where the robots are different than us </v>

1569
01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:29.860
<v Speaker 6>non-writers thing where it's like </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not an expression of us or an </v>

1570
01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:30.320
<v Speaker 6>expansion of us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1571
01:17:30.321 --> 01:17:35.321
<v Speaker 6>they could be us as they could.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They could take what we are.</v>

1572
01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.430
<v Speaker 6>Our brains,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

1573
01:17:37.431 --> 01:17:40.880
<v Speaker 6>which is what is creating all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>simulation theory forever.</v>

1574
01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:45.860
<v Speaker 6>Once they take a human brain scan than </v>
<v Speaker 6>neurons in it,</v>

1575
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:51.070
<v Speaker 6>ron energy through it and replicated </v>
<v Speaker 6>inside a machine will now you have </v>

1576
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.570
<v Speaker 6>ambition now</v>

1577
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:52.620
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1578
01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:55.160
<v Speaker 1>that's a big leap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have matter.</v>

1579
01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:57.740
<v Speaker 1>You have organic matter that will move </v>
<v Speaker 1>and react.</v>

1580
01:17:57.741 --> 01:18:02.741
<v Speaker 1>Did the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of consciousness being </v>

1581
01:18:02.741 --> 01:18:04.640
<v Speaker 1>completely local is a fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial idea.</v>

1582
01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:09.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that consciousness even resides </v>

1583
01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:09.730
<v Speaker 1>in the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1584
01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:13.261
<v Speaker 1>if you want to get all woo with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believe that consciousness is like </v>

1585
01:18:13.261 --> 01:18:13.460
<v Speaker 1>radio signals in your body is </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially</v>

1586
01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:18.570
<v Speaker 6>really good antenna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no way except to be speculative </v>

1587
01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:18.570
<v Speaker 6>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1588
01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:19.110
<v Speaker 6>it hasn't happened yet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so why would you?</v>

1589
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:24.350
<v Speaker 6>But I would speculate that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to recreate a human mind inside a </v>

1590
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:27.891
<v Speaker 6>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would speculate that the thing is </v>

1591
01:18:27.891 --> 01:18:30.711
<v Speaker 6>going to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you want to say that there's </v>

1592
01:18:30.711 --> 01:18:32.361
<v Speaker 6>consciousness that is exteriorized,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then I would say that that brain would </v>

1593
01:18:32.361 --> 01:18:34.680
<v Speaker 6>be an antenna for it in the same way </v>
<v Speaker 6>that our brains are.</v>

1594
01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:37.080
<v Speaker 1>That to me is like saying that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreate it,</v>

1595
01:18:37.081 --> 01:18:38.220
<v Speaker 1>a car would start itself.</v>

1596
01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:42.720
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>because cars never start themselves.</v>

1597
01:18:42.721 --> 01:18:47.721
<v Speaker 6>Human brains are innately awake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're innately Sarah.</v>

1598
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Create an artificial baby and let this </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby live life and learn all the things </v>

1599
01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:57.191
<v Speaker 1>that a person learns to develop a </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality or you can have somehow </v>

1600
01:18:57.191 --> 01:18:58.340
<v Speaker 1>another download.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's already formulated 80 year old</v>

1601
01:18:58.341 --> 01:19:00.210
<v Speaker 1>personality into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1602
01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:00.860
<v Speaker 1>this creature.</v>

1603
01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:05.920
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that you've got a lot of </v>

1604
01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:05.920
<v Speaker 6>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1605
01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.450
<v Speaker 6>it's literally the ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we take the neural pathways of the </v>

1606
01:19:08.931 --> 01:19:11.660
<v Speaker 6>human brain and replicate them inside a </v>
<v Speaker 6>machine,</v>

1607
01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:16.050
<v Speaker 6>the question that we're coming up </v>
<v Speaker 6>against as does the thing is,</v>

1608
01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:17.280
<v Speaker 6>will the thing think?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Will it be</v>

1609
01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that will will the thing be a </v>

1610
01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.761
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will it grow old or does it just exists </v>

1611
01:19:24.761 --> 01:19:27.461
<v Speaker 1>in the state that you created in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you able to create not just a </v>

1612
01:19:27.461 --> 01:19:29.060
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the mechanisms inside of a person,</v>

1613
01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:34.061
<v Speaker 1>the genetic coding that allows a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>to continue to grow and get older and </v>

1614
01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:36.830
<v Speaker 1>move forward?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot.</v>

1615
01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:39.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of questions because is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a meat bag?</v>

1616
01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:44.300
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that would be really creepy if we </v>

1617
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:44.300
<v Speaker 1>created a person and then just nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>clicked.</v>

1618
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.740
<v Speaker 1>It's just a meat bag that just dumb as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1619
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile it's got the most advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind ever.</v>

1620
01:19:48.231 --> 01:19:53.231
<v Speaker 1>We checked the switches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's on no desire to move </v>

1621
01:19:53.231 --> 01:19:53.231
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1622
01:19:53.231 --> 01:19:57.250
<v Speaker 1>and then we developed a robot woman to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suck his Dick and then all of a sudden </v>

1623
01:19:57.250 --> 01:19:58.850
<v Speaker 1>he's out there huffing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a Ferrari.</v>

1624
01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:02.200
<v Speaker 1>He got a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1625
01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:07.700
<v Speaker 6>It's an interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is an amazing fucking drug and in a </v>

1626
01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:12.381
<v Speaker 6>definitely no one can argue with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fact that it has been the carrot in </v>

1627
01:20:12.381 --> 01:20:15.100
<v Speaker 6>front of a lot of people's ambition,</v>

1628
01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.890
<v Speaker 1>washing a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you say all the.</v>

1629
01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:20.430
<v Speaker 1>The idea of to be loved is in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost anything</v>

1630
01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:22.000
<v Speaker 6>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All.</v>

1631
01:20:22.001 --> 01:20:27.001
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I guess I'm just thinking like </v>

1632
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:27.001
<v Speaker 6>maybe there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1633
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:27.001
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1634
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:27.480
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it peace.</v>

1635
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.940
<v Speaker 1>It is a piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not be your entire expression,</v>

1636
01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:32.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's a piece of your motivation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing anything.</v>

1637
01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:35.400
<v Speaker 1>It's to be loved or the love of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

1638
01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:40.730
<v Speaker 1>The love of what you're doing ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a better way of approaching it and </v>

1639
01:20:40.730 --> 01:20:40.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1640
01:20:40.730 --> 01:20:42.300
<v Speaker 1>you get love from doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1641
01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 1>and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a strange little,</v>

1642
01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a strange little exchange.</v>

1643
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Like if you concentrate too much on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on getting love for what you're doing,</v>

1644
01:20:51.391 --> 01:20:56.391
<v Speaker 1>then you're not going to do good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to concentrate on being loving </v>

1645
01:20:56.391 --> 01:20:58.500
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing and then when you love</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing and really focus on it</v>

1646
01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:00.450
<v Speaker 1>and then you get love from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1647
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:01.730
<v Speaker 1>It got me the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1648
01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1649
01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Don't you feel like that with comedy?</v>

1650
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:05.880
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The moment you get outside of that,</v>

1651
01:21:05.881 --> 01:21:07.410
<v Speaker 6>you are fucked man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1652
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:08.480
<v Speaker 6>this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's in the,</v>

1653
01:21:08.481 --> 01:21:13.481
<v Speaker 6>in the Bhagavad Gita.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The versus you have a right to your </v>

1654
01:21:13.481 --> 01:21:13.481
<v Speaker 6>actions and not the fruit of your </v>
<v Speaker 6>actions,</v>

1655
01:21:13.481 --> 01:21:17.841
<v Speaker 6>which means you just focus on what </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're doing and don't worry about </v>

1656
01:21:17.841 --> 01:21:21.381
<v Speaker 6>what's going to flourish on the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then everything works out much </v>

1657
01:21:21.381 --> 01:21:21.381
<v Speaker 6>better.</v>

1658
01:21:21.381 --> 01:21:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like socialism to me,</v>

1659
01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Duncan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what that sounds like.</v>

1660
01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Bhagavad Gita.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Queer,</v>

1661
01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:28.270
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty fucking writing.</v>

1662
01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.160
<v Speaker 1>What else does it tell you to do?</v>

1663
01:21:31.090 --> 01:21:31.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that it's,</v>

1664
01:21:31.961 --> 01:21:36.961
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's one of the sure ways to destroy </v>

1665
01:21:36.961 --> 01:21:36.961
<v Speaker 6>yourself is when you start worrying </v>
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>

1666
01:21:36.961 --> 01:21:37.810
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or you can't.</v>

1667
01:21:37.811 --> 01:21:38.890
<v Speaker 6>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's unavoidable.</v>

1668
01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever had a conversation with </v>

1669
01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:44.040
<v Speaker 1>your agent about how to improve your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1670
01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.800
<v Speaker 1>your response from the audience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to give the people what they want.</v>

1671
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:47.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank God.</v>

1672
01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.480

<v Speaker 1>you're going to think like why is pretty</v>

<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Masada would give the worst </v>

1674
01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:56.640
<v Speaker 1>fucking advice in the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world to comics and number one of them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>things and you gotta figure out your </v>

1682
01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:14.680
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you get a guy who's not a comic</v>

1683
01:22:14.681 --> 01:22:16.740
<v Speaker 1>that comes along with like the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>advice ever.</v>

1684
01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Masada was this one dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That is your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything you say will say,</v>

1687

<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about man?</v>

1689
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Fucking generation x guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I ever told you about who's opening </v>

1690
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.030
<v Speaker 1>the door here,</v>

1691
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:39.270
<v Speaker 6>if I ever told you about the advice that</v>
<v Speaker 6>my first manager gave me.</v>

1692
01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.430
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he saw me.</v>

1693
01:22:41.431 --> 01:22:43.160
<v Speaker 6>This was years and years and you've </v>
<v Speaker 6>locked the store.</v>

1694
01:22:43.161 --> 01:22:44.670
<v Speaker 6>Just the case before creeps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're walking in.</v>

1695
01:22:44.671 --> 01:22:47.660
<v Speaker 6>This place is not exactly secure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>

1696
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:50.540
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brian got up years and years ago I.</v>

1697
01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:55.050
<v Speaker 6>He saw me with wet hair and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what your thing could be.</v>

1698
01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.250
<v Speaker 6>You could be.</v>

01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an awesome piece of advice.</v>

1701
01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Did you think about for a second?</v>

1702
01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:08.950
<v Speaker 6>Not even for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what is that even?</v>

1703
01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:10.630
<v Speaker 6>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess what I was thinking like,</v>

1704
01:23:10.631 --> 01:23:12.820
<v Speaker 6>well I'd probably get electrocuted for </v>
<v Speaker 6>one,</v>

1705
01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:14.830
<v Speaker 6>but what's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is that?</v>

<v Speaker 1>open mic?</v>

<v Speaker 1>like a very specific sort of fucking </v>

<v Speaker 6>into a place that I think about all the </v>

1782
01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:45.481
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is how much of what human beings </v>

1783
01:26:45.481 --> 01:26:48.480
<v Speaker 6>day to day that people are doing is just</v>
<v Speaker 6>is a stick in the same way that comics </v>

1784
01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:53.431
<v Speaker 6>have this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many times do you run into someone </v>

1785
01:26:53.431 --> 01:26:53.710
<v Speaker 6>who's got this thing going on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is their personality,</v>

1786
01:26:53.711 --> 01:26:58.711
<v Speaker 6>their ego,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this thing that they're clinging to her </v>

01:26:58.711 --> 01:26:59.200
<v Speaker 6>putting out front that he isn't even </v>
<v Speaker 6>them at all.</v>

1788
01:26:59.470 --> 01:27:04.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many people do that in the guise of </v>

1789
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.470
<v Speaker 4>a radio personality?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:07.090
<v Speaker 4>isn't that like the ultimate goof?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The radio personality?</v>

1791
01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:11.350
<v Speaker 4>I was listening to Opie and Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 4>today and they do a thing called October</v>

1792
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:16.470
<v Speaker 4>where they go after hacky radio people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they start talking like them and </v>

1793
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:17.980
<v Speaker 4>mocking their act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that.</v>

1794
01:27:17.981 --> 01:27:20.600
<v Speaker 4>It's the Strip club Dj the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

1795
01:27:20.610 --> 01:27:21.910
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go into the,</v>

1796
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:25.600
<v Speaker 4>hey ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>$15.</v>

1797
01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:30.630
<v Speaker 4>Kamikaze is coming up to the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Girls drink for free guy ladies night </v>

1798
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:34.060
<v Speaker 4>and then the president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1799
01:27:34.090 --> 01:27:39.090
<v Speaker 4>very much so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you speak in front of great groups </v>

1800
01:27:39.090 --> 01:27:42.490
<v Speaker 4>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you must take on a different inflection.</v>

1801
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:45.220
<v Speaker 4>We as a nation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't just talk to them.</v>

1802
01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:48.850
<v Speaker 4>This is what I think we need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this country is crazy.</v>

1803
01:27:49.150 --> 01:27:51.660
<v Speaker 4>We got to change some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you saying?</v>

1804
01:27:51.670 --> 01:27:52.660
<v Speaker 4>You're not presidential.</v>

1805
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:54.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could say the same thing in a normal</v>

1806
01:27:54.591 --> 01:27:58.700
<v Speaker 6>way and it would seem really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>weird what my opponent thinks.</v>

1807
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>My not my opponent just thinks that the </v>

1808
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.420
<v Speaker 6>taxes are too high and I disagree.</v>

1809
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:09.360
<v Speaker 4>It does not concern me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What concerns me is the good will of the</v>

1810
01:28:09.361 --> 01:28:14.361
<v Speaker 4>American people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What concerns me is the prosperity of </v>

1811
01:28:14.361 --> 01:28:18.680
<v Speaker 4>the American nation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want people to be nicer to each </v>

1812
01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.261
<v Speaker 4>other and make more money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What concerns me is seeing more made in </v>

1813
01:28:21.261 --> 01:28:21.840
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stickers on goods.</v>

1814
01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was that voice,</v>

1815
01:28:25.151 --> 01:28:27.400
<v Speaker 6>that hypnotic fucking voice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then we allow it,</v>

1816
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:30.790
<v Speaker 6>but keep bringing that down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's personality types,</v>

1817
01:28:30.791 --> 01:28:35.791
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is where you get into like certain </v>

1818
01:28:35.791 --> 01:28:37.411
<v Speaker 6>personality types where you'll run into </v>
<v Speaker 6>specific groups of people who all act </v>

1819
01:28:38.561 --> 01:28:40.990
<v Speaker 6>exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like goths.</v>

1820
01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:43.730
<v Speaker 6>People were under certain band.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They all act.</v>

1821
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:48.750
<v Speaker 6>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they all share the similar personality </v>

1822
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:48.750
<v Speaker 6>and in colts it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>

1823
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:53.430
<v Speaker 6>one of this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of the aspects of culture is that </v>

1824
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:55.150
<v Speaker 6>everyone in the colt kind of acts the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same way and the way they're acting like</v>

1825
01:28:55.151 --> 01:28:57.070
<v Speaker 6>is like the leader,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

1826
01:28:57.071 --> 01:29:02.071
<v Speaker 6>So it gets really interesting when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>start considering to yourself how much </v>

1827
01:29:02.071 --> 01:29:06.621
<v Speaker 6>of what I'm doing is a shtick or how </v>
<v Speaker 6>much of what I'm doing is just imitated </v>

1828
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:08.460
<v Speaker 6>from someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's.</v>

1829
01:29:08.461 --> 01:29:11.130
<v Speaker 6>My parents were good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Excellent sense.</v>

1830
01:29:11.131 --> 01:29:11.740
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1831
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:13.780
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we inflect on words.</v>

1832
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:18.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even realize how heavy my </v>

1833
01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Boston accent was until I started seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself on television.</v>

1834
01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I saw myself on television when I was 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>after taekwondo tournament.</v>

1835
01:29:22.151 --> 01:29:23.080
<v Speaker 1>I heard my accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1836
01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:23.660
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

1837
01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:28.730
<v Speaker 6>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to stop that and I've slowly like </v>

1838
01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:28.730
<v Speaker 6>removed it over the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you have to hear it.</v>

1839
01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:30.540
<v Speaker 6>You have to hear it to realize you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>even saying it.</v>

1840
01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:32.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's fucking crazy man.</v>

1841
01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:33.080
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1842
01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:35.220
<v Speaker 6>and it's just amplitude tutor </v>
<v Speaker 6>atmosphere.</v>

1843
01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:39.990
<v Speaker 6>It's fun to like chase that thing back </v>
<v Speaker 6>and to.</v>

1844
01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:45.020
<v Speaker 6>This is where psychedelics are really </v>
<v Speaker 6>useful is because you begin to start </v>

1845
01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:46.440
<v Speaker 6>contemplating will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who is behind all this?</v>

1846
01:29:46.441 --> 01:29:48.000
<v Speaker 6>Who's behind the accent?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who's.</v>

1847
01:29:48.330 --> 01:29:50.250
<v Speaker 6>Do you ever just think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where do my words come from?</v>

1848
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:51.030

1860
01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:21.180
<v Speaker 6>fluxion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well remember when a movie would come </v>

1861
01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:21.180
<v Speaker 6>out when you were an alum.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Actually,</v>

1862
01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:24.781
<v Speaker 6>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like one guy is not a patient </v>

1863
01:30:24.781 --> 01:30:24.781
<v Speaker 6>zero when it comes to accents,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1864
01:30:24.781 --> 01:30:28.710
<v Speaker 6>it's some kind of collaborative </v>
<v Speaker 6>collaboration between groups of cool </v>

1865
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:28.710
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

1866
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:33.320
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when a movie would come out and you </v>

1867
01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.581
<v Speaker 6>would be an elementary school and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>some catchphrase from that movie would </v>

1868
01:30:35.581 --> 01:30:37.120
<v Speaker 6>suddenly go rushing through elementary </v>
<v Speaker 6>school again.</v>

1869
01:30:37.150 --> 01:30:38.500
<v Speaker 6>I'm Rick James.</v>

1871
01:30:39.461 --> 01:30:44.461

<v Speaker 6>Where it just kind of like a wildfire </v>

1872
01:30:44.461 --> 01:30:46.981
<v Speaker 6>goes through idiots and they just </v>
<v Speaker 6>imitate and imitate and imitate the </v>

1873
01:30:46.981 --> 01:30:47.140
<v Speaker 6>can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They can't help it.</v>

1874
01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:48.310
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this,</v>

1875
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:50.730
<v Speaker 6>this is the big question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is like,</v>

1876
01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:53.050
<v Speaker 6>but it's also fun.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>God damn everyone's guilty of it,</v>

1882
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:02.220
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's.</v>

1883
01:31:02.230 --> 01:31:04.420
<v Speaker 6>It seems to be up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There seems to be a prevalence of people</v>

1884
01:31:04.421 --> 01:31:06.250
<v Speaker 6>saying boo right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Boom.</v>

1891
01:31:18.731 --> 01:31:23.731
<v Speaker 6>but I'm saying it's interesting to see </v>
<v Speaker 6>how certain behavior just micro bay </v>

1892
01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:28.000
<v Speaker 6>micro behaviors get imitated and echoed </v>
<v Speaker 6>throughout society.</v>

1893
01:31:28.001 --> 01:31:29.260
<v Speaker 6>It's a very interesting.</v>

1894
01:31:29.410 --> 01:31:31.060
<v Speaker 1>It is fascinating.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting.</v>

1897
01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:35.950
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting that we sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>amalgamate.</v>

1898
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:41.350
<v Speaker 1>We've sort of taken from all all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of different sources around us that we </v>

1899
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:42.100
<v Speaker 1>like all the different things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1900
01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:43.930

<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1901
01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:48.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see a certain comics that are like </v>

<v Speaker 1>opening for Doug?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever went to one at dog shows,</v>

1904

<v Speaker 1>he would have guys open forum and they </v>

1905
01:31:57.390 --> 01:31:57.430
<v Speaker 1>were essentially doing stanhope and also</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1907
01:31:59.621 --> 01:32:00.490

1908
01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:06.600
<v Speaker 7>It's super common.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was a million have tells for </v>

1909
01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:06.940
<v Speaker 7>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're just huge fans of a towel and they</v>

1910
01:32:06.941 --> 01:32:09.250
<v Speaker 7>couldn't even help it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They started talking</v>

1911
01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:13.230
<v Speaker 6>day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just found themselves doing it,</v>

1912
01:32:13.650 --> 01:32:15.090
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't even realize it.</v>

1913
01:32:15.091 --> 01:32:19.710
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking incredible man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's like you get thumped printed by</v>

1914
01:32:19.810 --> 01:32:23.910
<v Speaker 6>a reality in that way and it's goes way </v>
<v Speaker 6>back.</v>

1915
01:32:23.911 --> 01:32:25.030
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's.</v>

1916
01:32:25.190 --> 01:32:30.190
<v Speaker 6>I just had my mom is a shrink on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>podcast and like she was talking about </v>

1917
01:32:30.190 --> 01:32:32.700
<v Speaker 6>the effect that she thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What happens when you were a kid,</v>

1918
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:35.280
<v Speaker 6>like getting your Dick snipped off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you were saying,</v>

1919
01:32:35.281 --> 01:32:39.090
<v Speaker 6>has on the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It has a huge effect.</v>

1920
01:32:39.091 --> 01:32:43.920
<v Speaker 6>You get some printed by your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by the subjective Dna of your parents,</v>

1921
01:32:43.921 --> 01:32:48.870
<v Speaker 6>get them printed into you and then you </v>
<v Speaker 6>spend the rest of your life in this kind</v>

1922
01:32:48.871 --> 01:32:53.130
<v Speaker 6>of strange hypnotic trance not knowing </v>
<v Speaker 6>why you're doing what you're doing.</v>

1923
01:32:53.730 --> 01:32:56.290
<v Speaker 6>And that I think is the beginning of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1924
01:32:56.310 --> 01:33:01.310
<v Speaker 6>when you're talking about dumb dumb </v>
<v Speaker 6>people or people live or absorbed into </v>

1925
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:04.581
<v Speaker 6>some religious structure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the beginning of human ness </v>

1926
01:33:04.581 --> 01:33:06.480
<v Speaker 6>starts when you start thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>

1927
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:10.230
<v Speaker 6>what am I really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's behind this fucking mask?</v>

1928
01:33:10.231 --> 01:33:15.231
<v Speaker 6>What's behind the behavior mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I picked up from my folks are from </v>

1929
01:33:15.231 --> 01:33:18.660
<v Speaker 6>movies or from influential friends or </v>
<v Speaker 6>from whatever.</v>

1930
01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:23.840
<v Speaker 6>What's the being residing behind all </v>
<v Speaker 6>that shit and that I think is when you </v>

1931
01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.880
<v Speaker 6>stop being a machine or start waking up </v>
<v Speaker 6>a little bit,</v>

1932
01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:32.120
<v Speaker 6>but until then you might as well be a </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking brain and it God damn commodore </v>

1933
01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:32.120
<v Speaker 6>64.</v>

1934
01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:37.300
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or You just enjoy this fucking weird </v>

1935
01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:40.511
<v Speaker 7>existence and marvel at all the mystery </v>
<v Speaker 7>of it all and just sort of try to take </v>

1936
01:33:40.791 --> 01:33:43.070
<v Speaker 7>it in and just enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because if you,</v>

1937
01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:47.060
<v Speaker 7>if you try to like get down to your core</v>
<v Speaker 7>all day,</v>

1938
01:33:47.061 --> 01:33:50.200
<v Speaker 7>every day you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to miss what's,</v>

1939
01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:55.280
<v Speaker 7>what's enjoyable about the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't necessarily know if we're ever </v>

1940
01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:58.220
<v Speaker 7>going to figure out what's motivating </v>
<v Speaker 7>us,</v>

1941
01:33:58.221 --> 01:34:00.120
<v Speaker 7>pushing us in one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>

1942
01:34:00.230 --> 01:34:02.030
<v Speaker 7>Why do you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why do you talk the way you talk?</v>

1943
01:34:02.330 --> 01:34:03.200
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who are you?</v>

1944
01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:08.290
<v Speaker 7>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I do love the fact that there's so </v>

1945
01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:09.410
<v Speaker 7>many variables.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do love a guy like Joey Diaz.</v>

1946
01:34:09.411 --> 01:34:11.690
<v Speaker 7>I do love how Ra is so much different </v>
<v Speaker 7>than Joey.</v>

1947
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:13.430
<v Speaker 7>Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So much different than me.</v>

1948
01:34:13.431 --> 01:34:16.160
<v Speaker 7>We're all just weird,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1949
01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:21.220
<v Speaker 7>personalities that have come about </v>
<v Speaker 7>through a whole bunch of different </v>

1950
01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:24.971
<v Speaker 7>scenarios,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a bunch of different ways to live a </v>

1951
01:34:24.971 --> 01:34:24.971
<v Speaker 7>life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1952
01:34:24.971 --> 01:34:28.990
<v Speaker 7>and different locations and different </v>
<v Speaker 7>problems and challenges and different </v>

1953
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:30.860
<v Speaker 7>genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a fucking trip,</v>

1954
01:34:30.861 --> 01:34:35.861
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The human experience to get to from </v>

1955
01:34:35.861 --> 01:34:37.790
<v Speaker 7>point a to Duncan trussell at 37 years </v>
<v Speaker 7>old is a wild,</v>

1956
01:34:37.791 --> 01:34:42.791
<v Speaker 7>crazy fuck load and everyone's road is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is unique and different and and creates </v>

1957
01:34:44.121 --> 01:34:44.870
<v Speaker 7>a different result.</v>

1958
01:34:45.190 --> 01:34:48.490
<v Speaker 6>Have you heard the term dependent </v>
<v Speaker 6>origination?</v>

1959
01:34:49.210 --> 01:34:54.210
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a Buddhist term and the term is </v>

1960
01:34:54.210 --> 01:34:56.860
<v Speaker 6>that there is nothing independent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing independent of it.</v>

1961
01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:01.880
<v Speaker 6>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no thing that isn't related to some </v>

1962
01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:02.840
<v Speaker 6>other thing in the universe which </v>
<v Speaker 6>creates this kind of tapestry.</v>

1963
01:35:02.841 --> 01:35:05.150
<v Speaker 6>So makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the example that you know,</v>

1964
01:35:05.151 --> 01:35:09.620
<v Speaker 6>of course beer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this beer bottle is not by itself,</v>

1965
01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:14.621
<v Speaker 6>it comes from sand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just what you're seeing here is in </v>

1966
01:35:14.621 --> 01:35:19.070
<v Speaker 6>the flow of time that a temporary form </v>
<v Speaker 6>that a bunch of sand and paper,</v>

1967
01:35:19.071 --> 01:35:22.700
<v Speaker 6>which comes from trees his congealed </v>
<v Speaker 6>into to form this thing,</v>

1968
01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:27.850
<v Speaker 6>but 700 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this fucking thing is going to be sand </v>

1969
01:35:27.850 --> 01:35:31.541
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You said what you're watching right now </v>

1970
01:35:31.541 --> 01:35:33.521
<v Speaker 6>is just a moment of this thing's true </v>
<v Speaker 6>existence and in in in the same way you </v>

1971
01:35:34.011 --> 01:35:36.740
<v Speaker 6>and Joey Diaz and Brian and me and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone listening to this,</v>

1972
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:42.070
<v Speaker 6>or just one mode,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one moment of beingness in this web that</v>

1973
01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:47.200
<v Speaker 6>for us traces all the way back </v>
<v Speaker 6>apparently to nuclear fusion inside of </v>

1974
01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:51.731
<v Speaker 6>stars,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which has gone through infinite time </v>

1975
01:35:51.731 --> 01:35:53.300
<v Speaker 6>until it's finally manifested in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>form of whatever the parts.</v>

1976
01:35:53.890 --> 01:35:55.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

1977
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:58.940
<v Speaker 6>Which for a moment in time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for a moment in time,</v>

1978
01:35:58.941 --> 01:36:02.540
<v Speaker 6>that little bit of the tab tonight at </v>
<v Speaker 6>10:30</v>

1979
01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:04.370
<v Speaker 7>sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Bitch.</v>

1980
01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:05.870
<v Speaker 7>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1981
01:36:05.871 --> 01:36:10.871
<v Speaker 7>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a an amazing connection that we </v>

1982
01:36:10.871 --> 01:36:14.261
<v Speaker 7>have to everything that's ever existed </v>
<v Speaker 7>and we are part of some weird infinite </v>

1983
01:36:14.261 --> 01:36:14.840
<v Speaker 7>cycle as as the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as,</v>

1984
01:36:14.841 --> 01:36:18.050
<v Speaker 7>as the star that heats the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All of these will end.</v>

1985
01:36:18.051 --> 01:36:19.550
<v Speaker 7>The universe won't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's this is,</v>

1986
01:36:19.551 --> 01:36:21.980
<v Speaker 7>but a blip,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even the life of a star is,</v>

1987
01:36:21.981 --> 01:36:25.850
<v Speaker 7>but a blip in the in the life of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>universe and they blow up all the time.</v>

1988
01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:30.200
<v Speaker 7>They said that there was a beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 7>show on a hyper novas there were talking</v>

1989
01:36:30.201 --> 01:36:33.860
<v Speaker 7>about when they first started detecting </v>
<v Speaker 7>gamma ray bursts in the galaxy.</v>

1990
01:36:33.861 --> 01:36:38.861
<v Speaker 7>They didn't know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They thought it was possible that we </v>

1991
01:36:38.861 --> 01:36:41.660
<v Speaker 7>were under attack by an alien race </v>
<v Speaker 7>because there was a huge burst of energy</v>

1992
01:36:41.690 --> 01:36:43.750
<v Speaker 7>that were were happening all over the </v>
<v Speaker 7>space,</v>

1993
01:36:43.810 --> 01:36:44.270
<v Speaker 7>all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all,</v>

1994
01:36:44.271 --> 01:36:46.700
<v Speaker 7>all throughout the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so they thought it was possible.</v>

1995
01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:49.520
<v Speaker 7>They were were actually alien wars at </v>
<v Speaker 7>one point in time.</v>

1996
01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:54.760
<v Speaker 7>That was something that was being </v>
<v Speaker 7>considered until they understand the </v>

1997
01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:54.760
<v Speaker 7>mechanism or understood rather than </v>
<v Speaker 7>mechanism.</v>

1998
01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:57.080
<v Speaker 7>Behind Novus,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're happening all the time.</v>

1999
01:36:57.081 --> 01:36:59.660
<v Speaker 7>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're just blowing out.</v>

2000
01:36:59.830 --> 01:37:02.990
<v Speaker 7>There's Mooney and stars.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We can't even.</v>

2001
01:37:03.330 --> 01:37:04.850
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You gotta go.</v>

2002
01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:08.540
<v Speaker 7>If in your lifetime to the Keck </v>
<v Speaker 7>observatory in Hawaii,</v>

2003
01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:10.940
<v Speaker 7>if you've never been there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's one of the,</v>

2004
01:37:10.941 --> 01:37:13.880
<v Speaker 7>one of the highest observatories and </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's above the clouds.</v>

2005
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:16.660
<v Speaker 7>It's really wild because you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you drive.</v>

2006
01:37:16.661 --> 01:37:19.940
<v Speaker 7>It's on the big island and you drive is </v>
<v Speaker 7>a long ass drive.</v>

2007
01:37:19.941 --> 01:37:24.941
<v Speaker 7>It's like a two hour drive up the </v>
<v Speaker 7>mountain and as you're driving you hit </v>

2008
01:37:24.941 --> 01:37:24.941
<v Speaker 7>clouds and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck man,</v>

2009
01:37:24.941 --> 01:37:28.070
<v Speaker 7>we're not going to be able to see shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We took this big drive up here,</v>

2010
01:37:28.071 --> 01:37:30.170
<v Speaker 7>but we're not going to able to see shit </v>
<v Speaker 7>because was all these clouds.</v>

2011
01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:34.010
<v Speaker 7>Then you drive past the clouds and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>get up there and you go,</v>

2012
01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:37.940
<v Speaker 7>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because first of all,</v>

2013
01:37:37.941 --> 01:37:42.941
<v Speaker 7>you're at 13,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>feet and second of all there's no light </v>

2014
01:37:42.941 --> 01:37:47.741
<v Speaker 7>pollution on the island.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They have these diffusers on all these </v>

2015
01:37:47.741 --> 01:37:50.771
<v Speaker 7>lamps,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so when you look at you don't even have </v>

2016
01:37:50.771 --> 01:37:50.771
<v Speaker 7>to look through a telescope.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dude,</v>

2017
01:37:50.771 --> 01:37:51.590
<v Speaker 7>you just look up when you're at the </v>
<v Speaker 7>observatory and you're like,</v>

2018
01:37:51.890 --> 01:37:55.530
<v Speaker 7>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The milky ways and staying.</v>

2019
01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:58.320
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it makes you so angry that you can't</v>

2020
01:37:58.321 --> 01:37:59.720
<v Speaker 7>see that every day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2021
01:38:00.210 --> 01:38:05.210
<v Speaker 7>Like if we didn't have these greedy ass </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking cities with lights everywhere </v>

2022
01:38:05.210 --> 01:38:09.231
<v Speaker 7>and driving around with headlights,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it would like if we could have just for </v>

2023
01:38:09.231 --> 01:38:13.521
<v Speaker 7>one hour or couple hours of one day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well maybe just one night a year where </v>

2024
01:38:14.701 --> 01:38:19.701
<v Speaker 7>everyone shots all the power off for </v>
<v Speaker 7>three hours and we all from six to 9:00</v>

2025
01:38:20.730 --> 01:38:25.730
<v Speaker 7>PM central.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Remember tonight is star appreciation </v>

2026
01:38:25.730 --> 01:38:30.111
<v Speaker 7>night.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We all shut out all the powers in </v>

2027
01:38:30.111 --> 01:38:30.111
<v Speaker 7>cities.</v>

2028
01:38:30.111 --> 01:38:30.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2029
01:38:30.111 --> 01:38:31.090
<v Speaker 2>they've tried that a few times where </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll look it up.</v>

2030
01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2031
01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Good idea.</v>

2032
01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:35.810
<v Speaker 7>See I'm behind the times somebody </v>
<v Speaker 7>thought it up,</v>

2033
01:38:35.811 --> 01:38:37.630
<v Speaker 7>but if we did that and you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

2034
01:38:37.710 --> 01:38:42.110
<v Speaker 7>you could see that we would have so many</v>
<v Speaker 7>people that would be so much more in awe</v>

2035
01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:45.650
<v Speaker 7>of space and so much more interested in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the.</v>

2036
01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:50.680
<v Speaker 7>And especially children interested in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the idea of pursuing astronomy or are </v>

2037
01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:52.790
<v Speaker 7>pursuing rocketry or working for NASA or</v>
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>

2038
01:38:52.791 --> 01:38:53.810
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just the,</v>

2039
01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:56.030
<v Speaker 7>our appreciation for,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2040
01:38:56.031 --> 01:39:01.031
<v Speaker 7>funding things like NASA and the Hubble </v>
<v Speaker 7>telescope and new telescopes and you </v>

2041
01:39:01.031 --> 01:39:03.110
<v Speaker 7>know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the Keck observatory and all these,</v>

2042
01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:08.200
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all that stuff would be so much more </v>

2043
01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:09.920
<v Speaker 7>appreciated if we could see the majesty </v>
<v Speaker 7>of the stars.</v>

2044
01:39:09.921 --> 01:39:13.010
<v Speaker 7>We've robbed ourselves from that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of that with cities,</v>

2045
01:39:13.290 --> 01:39:13.720
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2046
01:39:13.721 --> 01:39:18.721
<v Speaker 7>the light.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We don't even realize it because we've </v>

2047
01:39:18.721 --> 01:39:20.561
<v Speaker 7>grown up with these things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but all that light all the time has </v>

2048
01:39:20.561 --> 01:39:22.730
<v Speaker 7>robbed us of really the most amazing </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing you could ever see.</v>

2049
01:39:23.150 --> 01:39:25.400
<v Speaker 7>And one of the most humbling things I've</v>
<v Speaker 7>ever seen in my life.</v>

2050
01:39:25.610 --> 01:39:30.610
<v Speaker 7>I've had psychedelic experiences that </v>
<v Speaker 7>didn't affect me as much as looking at </v>

2051
01:39:30.610 --> 01:39:32.480
<v Speaker 7>those stars because I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember that night I couldn't sleep.</v>

2052
01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:37.540
<v Speaker 7>I remember I got back to the hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was just lying in bed staring up at </v>

2053
01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:40.661
<v Speaker 7>the ceiling,</v>
<v Speaker 7>thinking how insane that thing was and </v>

2054
01:39:40.661 --> 01:39:40.970
<v Speaker 7>that that's up there all the time that I</v>
<v Speaker 7>can't see it.</v>

2055
01:39:41.470 --> 01:39:46.470
<v Speaker 7>And it really hit home.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The feeling that was when I really </v>

2056
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:50.420
<v Speaker 7>started pushing the idea of the planet </v>
<v Speaker 7>as an organic spaceship.</v>

2057
01:39:50.690 --> 01:39:52.190
<v Speaker 7>That's when I really started talking </v>
<v Speaker 7>about it.</v>

2058
01:39:52.191 --> 01:39:53.810
<v Speaker 7>That's when I came up with that whole </v>
<v Speaker 7>bit about,</v>

2059
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:55.770
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>explaining the,</v>

2060
01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:56.790
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the war on Iraq,</v>

2061
01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:01.280
<v Speaker 7>hurling through the universal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how insane it is to pay attention to the</v>

2062
01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:01.430
<v Speaker 7>Grand Canyon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2063
01:40:01.431 --> 01:40:06.431
<v Speaker 7>that that bit it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's people out there look deep at </v>

2064
01:40:06.431 --> 01:40:06.431
<v Speaker 7>Grand Canyon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Meanwhile,</v>

2065
01:40:06.431 --> 01:40:07.400
<v Speaker 7>above you is infinity.</v>

2066
01:40:08.230 --> 01:40:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the Graham Hancock video </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he posted on his information </v>

2067
01:40:13.301 --> 01:40:18.301
<v Speaker 2>website of the sound of the Earth space?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I got the dolphins do.</v>

2068
01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:22.470
<v Speaker 7>It's the radio waves radio waves that </v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2069
01:40:22.471 --> 01:40:23.890
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the radiation belts.</v>

2070

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2071

<v Speaker 2>Sounds like,</v>

2072
01:40:26.710 --> 01:40:30.300
<v Speaker 2>sounds like dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like chirping Wales Brion.</v>

2073
01:40:30.330 --> 01:40:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Pull that up because it's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>trippy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called a earth hour.</v>

2077
01:40:37.710 --> 01:40:41.920
<v Speaker 2>It's actually one hour a year that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's supposed to do.</v>

2078
01:40:41.921 --> 01:40:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I just turn off all their power except </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the refrigerator for an hour.</v>

2079
01:40:44.730 --> 01:40:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2083
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.750
<v Speaker 6>He's got this newsletter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know the exact,</v>

2084
01:40:55.830 --> 01:41:00.830
<v Speaker 1>it's just I'm just look up scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>find the sound of the earth.</v>

2085
01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:03.500
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'll pop up right away.</v>

2086
01:41:03.501 --> 01:41:07.090
<v Speaker 6>It sounds like Chirping Josh or Wales.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2087
01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a apparently the sound of the </v>

2088
01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:16.641
<v Speaker 1>radio show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radiation belts and make a sound </v>

2089
01:41:16.641 --> 01:41:16.641
<v Speaker 1>that's like it wavers.</v>

2090
01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:17.710
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

2091
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're weird,</v>

2092
01:41:22.381 --> 01:41:27.381
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just a matter of time </v>

2093
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:33.310
<v Speaker 1>before we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get contacted by something that's </v>

2094
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:36.821
<v Speaker 1>more intelligent than us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking that more and more </v>

2095
01:41:36.821 --> 01:41:39.521
<v Speaker 1>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if there is something out there </v>

2096
01:41:39.521 --> 01:41:40.730
<v Speaker 1>that's more intelligent than than than </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

2097
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:44.710
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have to contact us really </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon because we're like real</v>

2098
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:45.900
<v Speaker 6>close.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2099
01:41:45.901 --> 01:41:46.920
<v Speaker 6>this is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2100
01:41:46.921 --> 01:41:51.921
<v Speaker 6>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember if fucking said that's </v>

2101
01:41:51.921 --> 01:41:54.201
<v Speaker 6>one of the singularity people said </v>
<v Speaker 6>humankind's first contact with an </v>

2102
01:41:54.201 --> 01:41:58.971
<v Speaker 6>extraterrestrial or with rather an alien</v>
<v Speaker 6>intelligence is going to be a machine </v>

2103
01:41:58.971 --> 01:42:03.471
<v Speaker 6>that's woken up and that's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>our first experience with it is </v>

2104
01:42:03.471 --> 01:42:03.471
<v Speaker 6>something we made</v>

2105
01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:07.790
<v Speaker 1>instead of instead of a thing from </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

2106
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>

2107
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:10.250
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

2108
01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:12.650
<v Speaker 1>It is possible that we're at the height.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2109
01:42:12.651 --> 01:42:17.030
<v Speaker 1>there was one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a recent Harvard astronomer that decided</v>

2110
01:42:17.031 --> 01:42:22.031
<v Speaker 1>after looking at 500 different stars </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we may be the only thing out there </v>

2111
01:42:22.190 --> 01:42:26.780
<v Speaker 1>and that there's so little a life or </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence of life in these.</v>

2112
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:29.990
<v Speaker 1>These planets is 500 different planets </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than they've observed,</v>

2113
01:42:30.290 --> 01:42:35.270
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most ridiculous because he is coming</v>

2114
01:42:35.271 --> 01:42:38.800
<v Speaker 1>from a planet that has life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those 500.</v>

2115
01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:41.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that there's nothing in 500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2116
01:42:41.691 --> 01:42:46.691
<v Speaker 1>You found one dummy and you're on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one and you found $500 that </v>

2117
01:42:46.691 --> 01:42:47.750
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you find one that does.</v>

2118
01:42:47.751 --> 01:42:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to add that in stupid.</v>

2119
01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:56.080
<v Speaker 1>You don't just go looking for another </v>
<v Speaker 1>one and if the other one you can't find </v>

2120
01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:56.080
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't exist.</v>

2121
01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile you are one that doesn't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>any sense.</v>

2122
01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:00.760
<v Speaker 6>And also man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that creek bed and Mars,</v>

2123
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:05.790
<v Speaker 6>that shit gives me goosebumps when I see</v>
<v Speaker 6>pictures of the fucking gravel and Mars </v>

2124
01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:10.171
<v Speaker 6>from water flowing on Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just think about what that must have </v>

2125
01:43:10.331 --> 01:43:15.331
<v Speaker 6>looked like on that planet with Martian </v>
<v Speaker 6>water rolling through whatever it was </v>

2126
01:43:15.331 --> 01:43:18.160
<v Speaker 6>rolling through.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there was probably life on Mars.</v>

2127
01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

2128
01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:23.750
<v Speaker 1>pull up how earth sounds from space on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube and uh,</v>

2129
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:25.910
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will freak you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's so it shows up the earth itself.</v>

2134
01:43:41.110 --> 01:43:42.760
<v Speaker 1>You see like cloud formations and shit.</v>

2168
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was I saying</v>

2169
01:45:13.210 --> 01:45:18.210
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you're talking about </v>

2170
01:45:18.210 --> 01:45:20.401
<v Speaker 4>before that man fucking lost me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There it is.</v>

2171
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:24.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a planet.</v>

2172
01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:31.660
<v Speaker 13>That's so creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Sounds like it's calling a dog.</v>

2173
01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:36.900
<v Speaker 13>You know what it's calling other planets</v>
<v Speaker 13>saying this place is filled with a bunch</v>

2174
01:45:37.571 --> 01:45:42.571
<v Speaker 13>of crickets and cons with nuclear bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Don't fuck with it.</v>

2175
01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:48.200
<v Speaker 4>Is the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that fucking thing.</v>

2176
01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:53.410
<v Speaker 4>That thing does not sound that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That does not sound like a defenseless </v>

2177
01:45:53.410 --> 01:45:53.410
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me.</v>

2178
01:45:53.410 --> 01:45:56.390
<v Speaker 4>That sounds like a thing that could just</v>
<v Speaker 4>jump out of the woods and bite your head</v>

2179
01:45:56.391 --> 01:45:56.870
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2180
01:45:56.871 --> 01:45:58.580
<v Speaker 4>that's not a real sound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2181
01:45:58.581 --> 01:46:03.581
<v Speaker 4>it's radio waves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we've sort of interpreted them as a </v>

2182
01:46:03.581 --> 01:46:06.461
<v Speaker 4>sound as I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's actually that you </v>

2183
01:46:06.461 --> 01:46:06.461
<v Speaker 4>stuck your head out of the space </v>
<v Speaker 4>shuttle.</v>

2184
01:46:06.461 --> 01:46:07.440
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2185
01:46:08.170 --> 01:46:10.770
<v Speaker 4>To get wiped off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2186
01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:12.670
<v Speaker 4>You probably would hear that accent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2187
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:16.250
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't hear shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your head would freeze instantly.</v>

2188
01:46:17.150 --> 01:46:20.300
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that crazy that you would just </v>
<v Speaker 4>freeze instantly in space?</v>

2189
01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:21.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just couldn't live.</v>

2190
01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:23.560
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

2191
01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Is there someone at the door?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is it?</v>

2192
01:46:27.330 --> 01:46:27.770

<v Speaker 1>I think what I think is our show,</v>

2194
01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:35.460
<v Speaker 1>a comedy show starts in 30 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's probably comics,</v>

2195
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:38.490
<v Speaker 1>but comics or would just come back here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not say anything.</v>

<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable as a man.</v>

2232
01:48:33.770 --> 01:48:38.770
<v Speaker 4>Afraid to experiment by what he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's judging me because I'm tying to all</v>

2256
01:49:42.941 --> 01:49:47.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the show is always like a bunch of </v>

2257
01:49:47.941 --> 01:49:48.160
<v Speaker 4>people like all in together</v>

2258
01:49:48.670 --> 01:49:52.570
<v Speaker 1>and it was really fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then within a half an hour,</v>

2259
01:49:52.571 --> 01:49:55.330
<v Speaker 1>an hour of them doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radio station took to their facebook</v>

2260
01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.360
<v Speaker 1>page because the ONA savages had started</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking the facebook page and shitting</v>

2261
01:50:01.001 --> 01:50:03.900
<v Speaker 1>all over it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bananas and sell them.</v>

2262
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:08.910
<v Speaker 1>They're all drowned in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so funny.</v>

2263
01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just fucking love that.</v>

2265
01:50:14.501 --> 01:50:16.690
<v Speaker 1>They're so sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took it on their facebook page.</v>

2266
01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened.</v>

2267
01:50:18.190 --> 01:50:19.420
<v Speaker 1>You got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got goofed on.</v>

2268
01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:24.570
<v Speaker 1>You should have been moved on a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago and then you would have never </v>

2269
01:50:24.570 --> 01:50:24.640
<v Speaker 1>done that radio voice.</v>

2270
01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:29.820
<v Speaker 2>I think they train in that voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that there's schools where </v>

2271
01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:33.601
<v Speaker 2>people trained to talk like that and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just choose like strip club or or radio </v>

2272
01:50:33.601 --> 01:50:35.000
<v Speaker 2>voice or whether person</v>

2273
01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:39.210
<v Speaker 1>it was saying anthony was saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they made them.</v>

2274
01:50:39.211 --> 01:50:40.590
<v Speaker 1>It was anthony or opening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget.</v>

2275
01:50:40.670 --> 01:50:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I think they're all talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy actually said,</v>

2276
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:47.820
<v Speaker 1>I want you to visualize who your </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>represents that guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a blue collar guy and just put </v>

<v Speaker 1>that's the guy you're talking to.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's your guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what Anthony was saying that he</v>

2282
01:50:59.761 --> 01:51:03.810
<v Speaker 1>put up John Casey.</v>

2305
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.480
<v Speaker 1>just incredibly self destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

2306
01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that like us losing our natural </v>

2307
01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:28.651
<v Speaker 1>reward system with hunter and gathering </v>
<v Speaker 1>and being stuck into some weird fucking </v>

2308
01:52:28.651 --> 01:52:32.371
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're taking pills and trying to </v>

2309
01:52:32.371 --> 01:52:35.250
<v Speaker 1>overcome reality with pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and sedate our sell through shit </v>

2310
01:52:35.250 --> 01:52:39.331
<v Speaker 1>jobs and boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless existences as a cog in the </v>

2311
01:52:39.331 --> 01:52:41.410
<v Speaker 1>wheel and then you just go crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>substance abuse,</v>

2312
01:52:41.730 --> 01:52:42.410
<v Speaker 2>see your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

2313
01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:47.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like the human version of pigs in </v>
<v Speaker 2>slaughterhouses that start chewing off </v>

2314
01:52:47.511 --> 01:52:50.090
<v Speaker 2>their own legs because they're too close</v>
<v Speaker 2>to each other.</v>

2315
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:55.330
<v Speaker 2>You just end up going into some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also a lot of times when people do </v>

2316
01:52:55.330 --> 01:52:55.460
<v Speaker 2>that shit outside of the guy who did rim</v>
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>

2317
01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:58.280
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times when people fuck up their</v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

2318
01:52:58.281 --> 01:53:02.240
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it because they want </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific types of girls to like them.</v>

2319
01:53:02.450 --> 01:53:07.450
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they're writing rim job </v>

2320
01:53:07.450 --> 01:53:07.450
<v Speaker 2>when you're not that I said except for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy,</v>

2321
01:53:07.450 --> 01:53:11.480
<v Speaker 2>but like the people who like just </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking like putting the hang themselves</v>

2322
01:53:11.481 --> 01:53:13.820
<v Speaker 2>from their nipples are like people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>do the earrings,</v>

2323
01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:18.940
<v Speaker 2>the big ear holes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you stand there looking for certain </v>

2324
01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:18.940
<v Speaker 2>types of girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it is.</v>

2325
01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it's amazing pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it for sure it hits the ear </v>

2326
01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:22.720
<v Speaker 2>thing is.</v>

2327
01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:23.740
<v Speaker 2>I would have never saw that coming me </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

2328
01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I met a lot of cool people that have it </v>
<v Speaker 2>too and I don't want to judge them.</v>

2329
01:53:26.630 --> 01:53:30.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to judge them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a fucking a trippy thing.</v>

2330
01:53:30.531 --> 01:53:32.600
<v Speaker 2>You gotTa fucking toilet paper roll in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your ear,</v>

2331
01:53:32.601 --> 01:53:37.601
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that prank or maybe it was </v>

2332
01:53:37.601 --> 01:53:37.601
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an idea for a prank.</v>

2333
01:53:37.601 --> 01:53:41.801
<v Speaker 2>It's awful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like you sneak up on one of </v>

2334
01:53:41.801 --> 01:53:44.801
<v Speaker 2>those guys with a lock and put it in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ear hole and lock it so they've got a </v>

2335
01:53:45.171 --> 01:53:50.171
<v Speaker 2>lock like locked into their ear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I saw a video of it or someone </v>

2336
01:53:50.171 --> 01:53:51.650
<v Speaker 2>suggesting someone do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brutal.</v>

2337
01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:54.020
<v Speaker 2>That's horrific because then you'd have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get it clipped.</v>

2338
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:56.630
<v Speaker 2>That's terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a dangerous thing,</v>

2339
01:53:56.631 --> 01:53:58.940
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a strategic thing to have giant</v>

2340
01:53:58.941 --> 01:54:01.310
<v Speaker 2>holes in your ears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous.</v>

2341
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2342
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:06.550
<v Speaker 2>What if.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you ripped it off and then beat </v>

2343
01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:06.550
<v Speaker 2>the guy to death with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:07.090

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2345
01:54:07.110 --> 01:54:08.180
<v Speaker 2>you would deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

2346
01:54:08.181 --> 01:54:09.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a shitty move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2347
01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Locking someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting a lock in someone's fucking </v>

2348
01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:14.680

<v Speaker 2>You better know that combination.</v>

2349
01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a rude prank.</v>

2350
01:54:15.710 --> 01:54:16.950
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess pranks,</v>

2351
01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:19.490
<v Speaker 2>the wrong word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an assault and attack,</v>

2352
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:21.080
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit.</v>

2355
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.870
<v Speaker 2>donuts in their heads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>head bagels.</v>

2356
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:34.450
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're sick of our bodies or </v>

2357
01:54:34.450 --> 01:54:34.450
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2358
01:54:34.450 --> 01:54:38.480
<v Speaker 2>We're taking these strange paths to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>our bodies look different.</v>

2359
01:54:38.481 --> 01:54:43.481
<v Speaker 2>It's really fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And The lady just grew an ear off or </v>

2360
01:54:43.481 --> 01:54:43.481
<v Speaker 2>arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that wasn't cosmetic.</v>

2361
01:54:43.481 --> 01:54:44.630
<v Speaker 2>That's because she had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had cancer.</v>

2362
01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not related,</v>

2363
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:48.500
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a lot of weird shit that people</v>

2364
01:54:48.501 --> 01:54:49.430
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I say that,</v>

2365
01:54:49.431 --> 01:54:51.210
<v Speaker 2>but then I have two sleeves of tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2366
01:54:51.770 --> 01:54:54.330
<v Speaker 2>two arms are covered in drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2367
01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:57.110
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But still again talk.</v>

2368
01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:59.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think two sleeves of tattoos is a fuck</v>

2369
01:54:59.641 --> 01:55:01.490
<v Speaker 2>load cooler than having your head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>flavor.</v>

2370
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cooler,</v>

2371
01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:04.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's still weird to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2372
01:55:04.851 --> 01:55:07.580
<v Speaker 2>the average person doesn't want to sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and have someone drawn them with a</v>

2373
01:55:07.581 --> 01:55:10.670
<v Speaker 2>fucking scratching needle shows inc </v>
<v Speaker 2>under their skin.</v>

2374
01:55:10.671 --> 01:55:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Just to make it look cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a fucking tattoo.</v>

2375
01:55:15.110 --> 01:55:16.400
<v Speaker 2>What'd you get?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:22.660
<v Speaker 2>It's torture me for my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always thinking about what it would </v>

2378
01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:23.440
<v Speaker 2>be and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that when I,</v>

2379
01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:26.030
<v Speaker 2>when I go out to Brazil and slurp back </v>
<v Speaker 2>some Iowasca,</v>

2380
01:55:26.031 --> 01:55:28.210
<v Speaker 2>it'll come to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just a little nervous,</v>

2381
01:55:28.230 --> 01:55:33.230
<v Speaker 2>a little sweet face on your arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little Hobo with a giant Dick like evil </v>

2408
01:56:48.631 --> 01:56:52.080
<v Speaker 6>the front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sounds really dumb when I came in.</v>

<v Speaker 6>So many books.</v>

2411
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:03.051
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the point is I would never want </v>

2412
01:57:03.051 --> 01:57:03.051
<v Speaker 6>curly tattooed on my body.</v>

2413
01:57:03.051 --> 01:57:06.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>terence Mckenna tattooed on them for the</v>

2414
01:57:06.051 --> 01:57:06.560
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

2415
01:57:06.610 --> 01:57:09.280
<v Speaker 6>I think that's pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't know man.</v>

2416
01:57:09.281 --> 01:57:12.520
<v Speaker 6>I like more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something that's less specific,</v>

2417
01:57:12.980 --> 01:57:14.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something that may be as</v>

2418
01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:18.300
<v Speaker 1>the Terence Mckenna Tattoo going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>real problematic if December 20,</v>

2419
01:57:18.301 --> 01:57:20.730
<v Speaker 1>first 2012 rolls over another that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

2420
01:57:21.210 --> 01:57:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Although he wasn't really convinced that</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything</v>

2421
01:57:23.550 --> 01:57:25.100
<v Speaker 6>was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well everyone's Scott.</v>

2422
01:57:25.101 --> 01:57:27.590
<v Speaker 6>That.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's a simple out for 2012,</v>

2423
01:57:27.591 --> 01:57:29.590
<v Speaker 6>which is that it's a shift in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>vibration.</v>

2424
01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's ever predicted anything ever.</v>

2425
01:57:35.170 --> 01:57:40.170
<v Speaker 1>That's my problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever correctly predicted any </v>

2426
01:57:40.170 --> 01:57:44.910
<v Speaker 1>like huge change in the world ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever said on this day to </v>

2427
01:57:46.511 --> 01:57:51.050
<v Speaker 1>specifically to the day the world will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world will change forever.</v>

2428
01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:53.780
<v Speaker 1>They tried with y two k?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2429
01:57:54.050 --> 01:57:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>

2430
01:57:56.440 --> 01:58:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they traveled with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if people thought 1984 was </v>

2431
01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:01.750
<v Speaker 1>going to be a big year because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

2432
01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>

2433
01:58:04.571 --> 01:58:09.571
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that.</v>

2434
01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1984 is like nothing compared to what's </v>

2435
01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:18.670
<v Speaker 1>really going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your fucking phone is a wireless gps</v>

2436
01:58:18.671 --> 01:58:23.671
<v Speaker 1>tracker that they can turn on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to you and record you talking </v>

2437
01:58:23.671 --> 01:58:23.671
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are?</v>

2438
01:58:23.671 --> 01:58:23.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit.</v>

2439
01:58:23.671 --> 01:58:26.230
<v Speaker 1>We are so primitive back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2440
01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Your phone plug into the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2441
01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:31.600
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting when you go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like the 18 hundreds,</v>

2442
01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:36.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when was the war of the worlds </v>

2443
01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:36.620
<v Speaker 1>weren't written.</v>

2444
01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was written in the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>

2445
01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:38.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Came on the radio.</v>

2446
01:58:38.450 --> 01:58:43.120
<v Speaker 1>People start radios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teen Twenties or thirties of the word.</v>

2447
01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:45.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll say 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty three.</v>

2448
01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:49.810
<v Speaker 1>One was went home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy did it on the radio.</v>

2449
01:58:50.050 --> 01:58:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Orson wells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What year was that?</v>

2450
01:58:52.090 --> 01:58:54.190
<v Speaker 1>It was hg wells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eighteen 98.</v>

2451
01:58:54.250 --> 01:58:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2452
01:58:55.930 --> 01:58:57.880
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orson Welles did it.</v>

2453
01:58:57.881 --> 01:59:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I think in the 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The early 19 hundreds.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2461
01:59:17.321 --> 01:59:22.321

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're doing that.</v>

2465

<v Speaker 1>Do you want to do one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

2466
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:30.130
<v Speaker 1>Don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2467
01:59:30.131 --> 01:59:31.630
<v Speaker 1>then we won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right folks.</v>

2468
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:33.910
<v Speaker 1>No more fucking podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2469
01:59:33.911 --> 01:59:35.710
<v Speaker 1>we got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not even 10:00</v>

2470
01:59:35.711 --> 01:59:36.100
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2471
01:59:37.330 --> 01:59:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep going then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're not going to do a nice house </v>

2472
01:59:42.330 --> 01:59:42.330
<v Speaker 1>chronicle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's keep going because it's only,</v>

2473
01:59:42.330 --> 01:59:42.430
<v Speaker 1>it's only a quarter to 10 shows at </v>
<v Speaker 1>10:30,</v>

2474
01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:45.970
<v Speaker 1>but to have a sold out show here tonight</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the Ice House,</v>

2475
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Ian Edwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to get your freak on.</v>

2476
01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:49.070
<v Speaker 6>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what about this,</v>

2477
01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:50.520
<v Speaker 6>this shit with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2478
01:59:51.010 --> 01:59:53.540
<v Speaker 6>the dispensary's now that it got </v>
<v Speaker 6>overturned,</v>

2479
01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:54.130
<v Speaker 6>what happened?</v>

2480
01:59:55.030 --> 02:00:00.030
<v Speaker 1>I think they decided to let them keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuing to operate because they need </v>

2481
02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:04.031
<v Speaker 1>the tax revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be catastrophic to a lot of </v>

2482
02:00:04.031 --> 02:00:04.031
<v Speaker 1>these neighborhoods if all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>those businesses pulled out.</v>

2483
02:00:04.031 --> 02:00:06.280
<v Speaker 1>What people don't understand is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2484
02:00:06.281 --> 02:00:11.281
<v Speaker 1>these businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these cannabis dispensaries have become </v>

2485
02:00:11.281 --> 02:00:14.130
<v Speaker 1>a big part of the economic success of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of communities mean not only do </v>

2486
02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:16.930
<v Speaker 1>people work there and have jobs and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid,</v>

2487
02:00:16.931 --> 02:00:19.030
<v Speaker 1>but they also pay rental landlords.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2488
02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:21.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's hundreds of them that would mean</v>

2489
02:00:21.731 --> 02:00:24.070
<v Speaker 1>that hundreds of places no longer have </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone renting them.</v>

2490
02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:27.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like there's a shortage of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2491
02:00:27.230 --> 02:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2492
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:31.960
<v Speaker 1>of places to rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of places to rent.</v>

2493
02:00:32.050 --> 02:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2494
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like commercial real estate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a look around at a lot of </v>

2495
02:00:38.430 --> 02:00:39.280
<v Speaker 1>commercial places to get a podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>studio,</v>

2496
02:00:40.030 --> 02:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>looked at a lot of office space and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

2497
02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:44.230
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere.</v>

2498
02:00:44.450 --> 02:00:49.450
<v Speaker 1>It's so many places are available and </v>
<v Speaker 1>open and if they decided just randomly </v>

2499
02:00:49.691 --> 02:00:54.691
<v Speaker 1>to shut down 700 different fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispensary's for just dubious reasons.</v>

2500
02:00:55.810 --> 02:00:57.820
<v Speaker 1>For reasons that don't make any sense at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

2501
02:00:57.970 --> 02:00:58.610
<v Speaker 1>it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would.</v>

2502
02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.920
<v Speaker 1>It would suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would fuck up.</v>

2503
02:00:59.921 --> 02:01:02.800
<v Speaker 1>The economy is a lot of money that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to paying taxes.</v>

2504
02:01:03.010 --> 02:01:03.850
<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is it.</v>

2505
02:01:04.450 --> 02:01:07.450
<v Speaker 6>Was that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I also read that the IDA was saying that</v>

2506
02:01:07.451 --> 02:01:09.750
<v Speaker 6>they're gonna stop rating medicinal </v>
<v Speaker 6>marijuana dispensary.</v>

2507
02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:11.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't read that.</v>

2508
02:01:11.441 --> 02:01:12.610
<v Speaker 1>When did they say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See someone.</v>

2509
02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:14.700
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it might have.</v>

2510
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.840
<v Speaker 6>It might be with</v>

2511
02:01:16.410 --> 02:01:18.820
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably would because one of the things</v>

2512
02:01:18.821 --> 02:01:23.821
<v Speaker 1>that I read is that the dea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't disclose any information </v>

2513
02:01:23.821 --> 02:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>about bus and what they're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going in and rating people.</v>

2514
02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>They're taking all the marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're taking their money,</v>

2515
02:01:28.241 --> 02:01:31.090
<v Speaker 1>taking their plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They confiscate all the records.</v>

2516
02:01:31.091 --> 02:01:36.091
<v Speaker 1>They write down everyone's name and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do nothing and they don't have to </v>

2517
02:01:36.091 --> 02:01:37.990
<v Speaker 1>do anything and when you try to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>information in the case,</v>

2518
02:01:38.590 --> 02:01:41.630
<v Speaker 1>they just say an ongoing investigation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't do anything,</v>

2519
02:01:41.690 --> 02:01:44.780
<v Speaker 1>so there's been a or doing something but</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ain't really doing nothing.</v>

2520
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:47.510
<v Speaker 1>They're coming in and jacking people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not arresting anybody.</v>

2521
02:01:47.511 --> 02:01:50.270
<v Speaker 1>And Todd Mccormick was the first person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who told me about this and I was like,</v>

2522
02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:52.130
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2523
02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:54.890
<v Speaker 1>am I missing something in the story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went and looked at it online,</v>

2524
02:01:54.891 --> 02:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the practice.</v>

2525
02:01:56.061 --> 02:02:01.061
<v Speaker 1>The practice is they just make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous for these people to try to </v>

2526
02:02:01.061 --> 02:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>run a business and they'd come in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take all their shit.</v>

2527
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:06.010
<v Speaker 15>Like trying to act like they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 15>something to kind of keep the show going</v>

2528
02:02:06.370 --> 02:02:10.990
<v Speaker 15>that they're doing their job but they </v>
<v Speaker 15>don't really want to arrest.</v>

2529
02:02:11.710 --> 02:02:16.360
<v Speaker 15>They probably agree with the states that</v>
<v Speaker 15>have California that have weed laws,</v>

2530
02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:17.400
<v Speaker 15>but there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 15>all right,</v>

2531
02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:19.990
<v Speaker 15>we got to do something so let's just </v>
<v Speaker 15>shut this down.</v>

2532
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:21.940
<v Speaker 15>But not really try people.</v>

2533
02:02:22.230 --> 02:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's an agreement thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of cops do not like weed.</v>

2534
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When when cops break into guys' houses </v>

2535
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>and shoot their dog 17 fucking times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look around and find a pipe,</v>

2536
02:02:33.001 --> 02:02:38.001
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of weed on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen some of those videos and </v>

2537
02:02:38.001 --> 02:02:38.001
<v Speaker 1>the links?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

2538
02:02:38.001 --> 02:02:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Trendous man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shot some former marine 17 times </v>

2539
02:02:42.370 --> 02:02:42.370
<v Speaker 1>the other day and they thought this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>had pot him.</v>

2540
02:02:42.370 --> 02:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>He had nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole thing is crazy.</v>

2541
02:02:44.361 --> 02:02:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was a dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no pot in the house.</v>

2542
02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:49.720
<v Speaker 15>When are you going to put some of these </v>
<v Speaker 15>cops away just to let other cops know.</v>

2543
02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:54.920
<v Speaker 15>It's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 15>let's not rush to judgment that police </v>

2544
02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:54.920
<v Speaker 15>chief is like,</v>
<v Speaker 15>let's not rush to judgment.</v>

2545
02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:59.910
<v Speaker 15>Let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 15>But they rushed to judgment when the </v>

2546
02:02:59.910 --> 02:03:04.021
<v Speaker 15>cops right up a criminal forum and </v>
<v Speaker 15>somebody that they arrest and they put </v>

2547
02:03:04.021 --> 02:03:06.490
<v Speaker 15>the story on the news,</v>
<v Speaker 15>like instantly that person's guilty,</v>

2548
02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:08.660
<v Speaker 15>but when a cop shoots somebody lists </v>
<v Speaker 15>this weight.</v>

2549
02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they do that,</v>

2550
02:03:10.441 --> 02:03:15.441
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet is sort of taking a lot of </v>

2551
02:03:15.441 --> 02:03:15.720
<v Speaker 1>that away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're exposing these people like that.</v>

2552
02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:20.780
<v Speaker 1>That officer at Uc Davis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pepper sprayed those kids in the </v>

2553
02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:23.451
<v Speaker 1>face and then there was a recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where the cop cold cocked a </v>

2554
02:03:23.581 --> 02:03:27.390
<v Speaker 1>chick at a Puerto Rican day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pride for it and he thought that she did</v>

2555
02:03:27.391 --> 02:03:28.260
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she didn't.</v>

2556
02:03:28.261 --> 02:03:29.880
<v Speaker 1>She just was in the wrong place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong time.</v>

2557
02:03:29.881 --> 02:03:32.370
<v Speaker 1>So he turns around and cracks her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucked up,</v>

2558
02:03:32.371 --> 02:03:37.371
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up to watch that guy's in </v>

2559
02:03:37.371 --> 02:03:37.371
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's in trouble be.</v>

2560
02:03:37.371 --> 02:03:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fucking shed vein.</v>

2561
02:03:37.470 --> 02:03:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Even if she did throw water on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to punch her.</v>

2562
02:03:39.751 --> 02:03:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a cop.</v>

2563
02:03:40.890 --> 02:03:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Girl throws water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't punch her in the face.</v>

2564
02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>A little more restricted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cool thing about the proliferation </v>

2565
02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:48.900
<v Speaker 1>of fucking cameras everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it goes both ways,</v>

2566
02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:53.100
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard that the TSA is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting you film them anymore.</v>

2567
02:03:53.101 --> 02:03:54.810
<v Speaker 1>If you heard this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that.</v>

2568
02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2569
02:03:55.891 --> 02:04:00.891
<v Speaker 1>That's when we had a WHO's telling us a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story?</v>

2570
02:04:01.650 --> 02:04:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Prayer was telling us the story of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being stuck at the airport and trying to</v>

2571
02:04:06.061 --> 02:04:08.630
<v Speaker 1>film and his girlfriend trying to film </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and they wouldn't let him.</v>

2572
02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:13.160
<v Speaker 1>They took him into a room and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a witness here anymore.</v>

2573
02:04:13.170 --> 02:04:18.170
<v Speaker 1>At least out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a witness like I want to film </v>

2574
02:04:18.170 --> 02:04:18.170
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't let him.</v>

2575
02:04:18.170 --> 02:04:18.830
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't let him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is,</v>

2576
02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:21.510
<v Speaker 1>it's just ridiculous.</v>

2577
02:04:21.580 --> 02:04:23.690
<v Speaker 15>Solaris the TSA.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I can like cops now.</v>

2578
02:04:24.330 --> 02:04:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Police State,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2579
02:04:25.681 --> 02:04:28.200
<v Speaker 1>we've reached a police state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People want to control people.</v>

2580
02:04:28.230 --> 02:04:29.900
<v Speaker 1>The system sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The systems a mass.</v>

2581
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:34.910
<v Speaker 1>People are complaining and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to control the people complaining </v>

2582
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:37.431
<v Speaker 1>so they want to tighten down a police </v>
<v Speaker 1>state instead of addressing what the </v>

2583
02:04:37.431 --> 02:04:40.340
<v Speaker 1>people are complaining about when people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where they're rioting in </v>

2584
02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:41.220
<v Speaker 1>the streets or there's an occupy Wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>Street type of movement.</v>

2585
02:04:41.490 --> 02:04:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that the government does not </v>

2586
02:04:46.490 --> 02:04:47.490
<v Speaker 1>address that on a formal basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a regular basis,</v>

2587
02:04:47.491 --> 02:04:49.830
<v Speaker 1>that they're not doing something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and adjusting.</v>

2588
02:04:49.831 --> 02:04:54.831
<v Speaker 1>It just shows you how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much content they have for the </v>

2589
02:04:54.831 --> 02:04:55.650
<v Speaker 1>actual people and who they really work </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

2590
02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:00.800
<v Speaker 1>That's not even a subject of a guarantee</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit's going to come up in the </v>

2591
02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:04.161
<v Speaker 1>debates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think they're going to talk about </v>

2592
02:05:04.161 --> 02:05:04.161
<v Speaker 1>occupy Wall Street and addressing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>demands</v>

2593
02:05:04.161 --> 02:05:07.830
<v Speaker 2>or the petro dollar or the or the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that China is like apparently switching </v>

2594
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:09.220
<v Speaker 2>away from the dollar to buy oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard about that shit?</v>

2595
02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:11.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't blame him.</v>

2596
02:05:11.741 --> 02:05:15.160
<v Speaker 2>If they're seen the value of the dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus doesn't even meet.</v>

2597
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:20.430
<v Speaker 2>This spooky thing is apparently our </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire currency is based on the fact </v>

2598
02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:24.220
<v Speaker 2>that most people use it to buy oil and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have to have vast reserves of it</v>

2599
02:05:24.490 --> 02:05:28.330
<v Speaker 2>on hand to buy the oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if that changes,</v>

2600
02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:33.360
<v Speaker 2>then our dollar will drop even more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's valued at now and the most extreme </v>

2601
02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:36.160
<v Speaker 2>way because it's not based on gold until</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people.</v>

2602
02:05:36.161 --> 02:05:39.760
<v Speaker 2>It's called the petro dollar theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on wikipedia.</v>

2603
02:05:39.761 --> 02:05:42.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the theory is that all the wars that</v>

2604
02:05:42.761 --> 02:05:47.761
<v Speaker 2>we've been in have been with places that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're about to switch the currency from </v>

2605
02:05:49.690 --> 02:05:54.690
<v Speaker 2>the dollar to something else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whenever that happens we go in and </v>

2606
02:05:54.690 --> 02:05:56.350
<v Speaker 2>attack because that's the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that our dollars valued on.</v>

2607
02:05:56.351 --> 02:06:01.351
<v Speaker 2>But it's a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a conspiracy about while we </v>

2608
02:06:01.351 --> 02:06:01.351
<v Speaker 2>attacked Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2609
02:06:01.351 --> 02:06:03.070
<v Speaker 2>and right after we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he had already switched over and</v>

2610
02:06:03.071 --> 02:06:05.370
<v Speaker 2>we attacked Iraq and then we turned it </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the dollar.</v>

2611
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Within a year of attacking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2612
02:06:09.190 --> 02:06:12.400
<v Speaker 2>Little while you'll hear them talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the fucking debates.</v>

2613
02:06:12.401 --> 02:06:13.540
<v Speaker 2>You won't hear that come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2614
02:06:13.541 --> 02:06:14.830
<v Speaker 2>you won't hear them talking about Wiki </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaks.</v>

2615
02:06:14.831 --> 02:06:16.390
<v Speaker 2>So there was a purpose to all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>wars.</v>

2616
02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:18.100
<v Speaker 2>That's good to know that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it for nothing.</v>

2617
02:06:18.101 --> 02:06:20.800
<v Speaker 2>That's good money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>

2618
02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:26.790
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to hear anybody talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Wiki leaks and the debate and that</v>

2619
02:06:26.791 --> 02:06:29.940
<v Speaker 1>shit ain't going to sweep that under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rug.</v>

2620
02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Is that dude still hold up in that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been there for months to get him any </v>

2621
02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:35.400
<v Speaker 2>pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should.</v>

2622
02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:37.810
<v Speaker 2>They should sneak him in some hippie </v>
<v Speaker 2>plus.</v>

2623
02:06:38.290 --> 02:06:40.490
<v Speaker 2>You have to pay rent there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

2624
02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:45.640
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if he's got a dope suite too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just promises not to leak anything </v>

2625
02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:45.640
<v Speaker 2>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2626
02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:47.500
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if he has to promise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

2627
02:06:47.550 --> 02:06:50.030
<v Speaker 2>He probably has some serious shit on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>

2628
02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:51.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird that</v>

2629
02:06:51.050 --> 02:06:55.280
<v Speaker 1>they're in there in England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the Ecuadorian embassy,</v>

2630
02:06:55.310 --> 02:06:57.770
<v Speaker 1>so he's allowed to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though he's in England,</v>

2631
02:06:57.771 --> 02:06:59.900
<v Speaker 1>they all just stand around waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to come out.</v>

2632
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:02.780
<v Speaker 1>So he stays in that house for months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been in that house for months</v>

2633
02:07:02.900 --> 02:07:07.900
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes out and does little speeches </v>

2634
02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:07.900
<v Speaker 2>from that balcony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's still in the house.</v>

2635
02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:11.531
<v Speaker 2>Technically I was calling him Ray Ponzel</v>
<v Speaker 2>rape rape.</v>

2636
02:07:16.750 --> 02:07:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Well they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2637
02:07:17.541 --> 02:07:18.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they already got that.</v>

2638
02:07:18.490 --> 02:07:21.400
<v Speaker 1>The DNA test back on the condom and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows none of his deal.</v>

2639
02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

2640
02:07:22.151 --> 02:07:23.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just want to get.</v>

2641
02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:26.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry Julian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>

2642
02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're jacking that guy.</v>

2643
02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:29.600
<v Speaker 2>It's really scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2644
02:07:30.020 --> 02:07:31.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking scary.</v>

2645
02:07:31.221 --> 02:07:36.221
<v Speaker 2>And also that other guy that's in just </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some pod somewhere getting hose 24 </v>

2646
02:07:36.281 --> 02:07:39.190
<v Speaker 2>hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have him in solitary confinement.</v>

2647
02:07:39.570 --> 02:07:41.470
<v Speaker 2>He's naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not allowed to wear clothes.</v>

2648
02:07:41.471 --> 02:07:45.310
<v Speaker 2>He just like balled up in a fetal </v>
<v Speaker 2>position in some orange room.</v>

2649
02:07:45.311 --> 02:07:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Getting sprayed with water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was is every few hours.</v>

2650
02:07:47.610 --> 02:07:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Music?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2651
02:07:48.670 --> 02:07:53.670
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you heard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made up a lot of that when I went to </v>

2652
02:07:54.071 --> 02:07:57.550
<v Speaker 2>visit him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it was after I fucked up.</v>

2653
02:07:58.470 --> 02:08:03.470
<v Speaker 2>But he's not doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he can send letters and </v>

2654
02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:03.470
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2655
02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can do anything enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>letters,</v>

2656
02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:08.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying essentially psychologically </v>

2657
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.470
<v Speaker 1>torturing.</v>

2658
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.650
<v Speaker 2>He's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet he's gone.</v>

2659
02:08:08.651 --> 02:08:11.230
<v Speaker 2>When he comes out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be a drooling boo Radley.</v>

2660
02:08:11.231 --> 02:08:12.700
<v Speaker 2>You won't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's optimistic</v>

2661
02:08:12.970 --> 02:08:15.860
<v Speaker 1>when it comes out of they're never </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out.</v>

2662
02:08:16.070 --> 02:08:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what.</v>

2663
02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:22.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really interesting is this guy </v>

2664
02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:22.760
<v Speaker 1>could have done something far worse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he would be in a real prison,</v>

2665
02:08:22.970 --> 02:08:25.550
<v Speaker 1>was interacting with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could have been a murderer,</v>

2666
02:08:25.670 --> 02:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>he could've been the DC sniper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could've been.</v>

2667
02:08:28.070 --> 02:08:33.070
<v Speaker 1>He could've done something far more </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific and he would be interacting </v>

2668
02:08:33.070 --> 02:08:35.270
<v Speaker 1>with people with this guy did was leaked</v>
<v Speaker 1>some information about some shit that he</v>

2669
02:08:35.271 --> 02:08:40.271
<v Speaker 1>thought was horrific and in doing so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're treating him like he is fucking </v>

2670
02:08:40.821 --> 02:08:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Lex Luthor to treating him like he's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>worst bad guy ever.</v>

2671
02:08:44.581 --> 02:08:49.581
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Manson's and a regular prison </v>

2672
02:08:49.581 --> 02:08:49.581
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

2673
02:08:49.581 --> 02:08:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen this list that leaked </v>

2674
02:08:52.460 --> 02:08:55.311
<v Speaker 2>about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different signs that someone's a </v>

2675
02:08:55.311 --> 02:08:56.610
<v Speaker 2>terrorist like at week from the army or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like what to look for?</v>

2676
02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:00.360
<v Speaker 2>What was one of them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything you do like you like you are.</v>

2677
02:09:01.590 --> 02:09:02.160
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2678
02:09:02.250 --> 02:09:07.250
<v Speaker 2>there's gradients on the list and on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>red side it's pretty much all of us.</v>

2679
02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:12.560
<v Speaker 2>All of us are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be considered like terrorists by </v>

2680
02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:13.560
<v Speaker 2>this new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you find it?</v>

2681
02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you use social media.</v>

2682
02:09:15.460 --> 02:09:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read some.</v>

2683
02:09:16.671 --> 02:09:21.671
<v Speaker 1>I read some of it back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This podcast would probably be </v>

2684
02:09:21.671 --> 02:09:23.610
<v Speaker 1>considered like communists the mccarthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>era or you know,</v>

2685
02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:27.020
<v Speaker 1>just just some red party shit for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2686
02:09:27.021 --> 02:09:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Here's some warning signs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the U,</v>

2687
02:09:29.041 --> 02:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>s military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2688
02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:34.100
<v Speaker 1>You've recently changed your choices in </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment.</v>

2689
02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:38.180
<v Speaker 1>You have peculiar discussions have gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a blowjob porn.</v>

2690
02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:43.310
<v Speaker 1>You complain about bias to your socially</v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawn.</v>

2691
02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Jody is jody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that on?</v>

2692
02:09:52.210 --> 02:09:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't hear him check their beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2693
02:09:56.830 --> 02:09:58.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're socially withdrawn.</v>

2694
02:09:58.310 --> 02:10:00.860
<v Speaker 1>You're frustrated with mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies.</v>

2695
02:10:01.130 --> 02:10:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Your risk factors for radicalization </v>
<v Speaker 1>include social networks and youth being </v>

2696
02:10:07.890 --> 02:10:12.890
<v Speaker 1>young on facebook because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a young urine terrorist.</v>

2697
02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:18.620
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is just like the most broad </v>

2698
02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:21.520
<v Speaker 1>sweeping brush I think I've ever read </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever in an official</v>

2699
02:10:22.010 --> 02:10:24.140
<v Speaker 2>think came out with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is some cons.</v>

2700
02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like the army and,</v>

2701
02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:31.680
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the combination of this with the </v>

2702
02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:33.961
<v Speaker 2>indefinite detention act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where shit gets creepy because </v>

2703
02:10:33.961 --> 02:10:33.961
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing to just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2704
02:10:33.961 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 2>those are</v>

2705
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:35.750
<v Speaker 6>signs that someone might be doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>something weird,</v>

2706
02:10:35.751 --> 02:10:40.751
<v Speaker 6>but then I think a terrorist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone suspected of terrorism can just </v>

2707
02:10:40.751 --> 02:10:43.220
<v Speaker 6>get arrested according to the indefinite</v>
<v Speaker 6>detention act without a trial.</v>

2708
02:10:43.850 --> 02:10:48.470
<v Speaker 6>So that's where she gets a little not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not going to sleep that well at night.</v>

2709
02:10:48.710 --> 02:10:53.710

<v Speaker 1>clearly censored,</v>

2712
02:10:58.161 --> 02:11:03.161
<v Speaker 1>like they were told not to tell stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are certain things that were told </v>

2713
02:11:03.161 --> 02:11:06.041
<v Speaker 1>not to cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain areas where they wanted </v>

2714
02:11:06.041 --> 02:11:08.750
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to report on actual news and</v>

2715
02:11:08.751 --> 02:11:13.751
<v Speaker 1>they were told not to and they were told</v>
<v Speaker 1>to read off government propaganda that </v>

2716
02:11:13.751 --> 02:11:14.210
<v Speaker 1>they knew was not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's not like people going,</v>

2721
02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:24.320
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they wouldn't act on that stuff.</v>

2722
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:24.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2725
02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:26.190

<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

2726
02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:31.480
<v Speaker 1>like they've figured out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control media and propaganda is a real </v>

2727
02:11:32.871 --> 02:11:34.610
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's 100 percent real.</v>

2728
02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:37.130
<v Speaker 1>They can big and lie to you all day long</v>

2729
02:11:37.180 --> 02:11:40.600
<v Speaker 6>and if you want to travel anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can restrict you.</v>

2730
02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:43.510
<v Speaker 6>They not only can they restrict you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but just to travel.</v>

2731
02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:48.660
<v Speaker 6>You are going to have your body </v>
<v Speaker 6>magnetically scans so they can see you </v>

2732

<v Speaker 6>If you travel,</v>

2733
02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:52.810
<v Speaker 6>you must allow them to see your name.</v>

2734
02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:53.960

<v Speaker 16>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 16>you remember that?</v>

2974
02:23:51.370 --> 02:23:54.550

<v Speaker 16>The only time outside of sex calls.</v>

2975
02:23:54.580 --> 02:23:57.900
<v Speaker 16>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but this is back in the eighties man bar</v>

<v Speaker 16>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 16>course sports phone.</v>

2978
02:24:01.930 --> 02:24:06.930
<v Speaker 16>I call the second phone line once while </v>
<v Speaker 16>I was beating off and I was a kid and </v>

2979
02:24:06.930 --> 02:24:07.390
<v Speaker 16>and,</v>
<v Speaker 16>and pain.</v>

2980
02:24:07.391 --> 02:24:09.040
<v Speaker 16>When the chick asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 16>can I help you?</v>

2981
02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:10.160
<v Speaker 16>Can I help you?</v>
<v Speaker 16>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 16>How am I going to pay for this?</v>

2984
02:24:15.041 --> 02:24:17.290
<v Speaker 16>I don't have a credit card,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but I just just all over myself.</v>

2985
02:24:17.291 --> 02:24:20.500
<v Speaker 16>So that's all you need.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Sometimes just the voice.</v>

2986
02:24:20.540 --> 02:24:21.100
<v Speaker 16>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 16>oh,</v>

2987
02:24:21.140 --> 02:24:22.120

<v Speaker 16>How much?</v>

2988
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:25.720
<v Speaker 16>I mean that's probably how many dudes </v>
<v Speaker 16>probably called people up.</v>

2989
02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:30.880
<v Speaker 15>Remember how far they were on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I remember it being a security guard at </v>

2990
02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:33.660
<v Speaker 15>night at this complex they were building</v>
<v Speaker 15>for seniors and the only thing to do was</v>

2991
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:36.340
<v Speaker 15>like you bought at night,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you just call the phone.</v>

2992
02:24:36.341 --> 02:24:41.341
<v Speaker 15>So I used to go down to the party line,</v>
<v Speaker 15>like I ran up like a thousand dollar </v>

2993
02:24:41.341 --> 02:24:43.930
<v Speaker 15>bill in like a week.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So I'm a security guard and I got to pay</v>

<v Speaker 15>I'm basically working for this party </v>
<v Speaker 15>line.</v>

2996
02:24:50.170 --> 02:24:51.760
<v Speaker 15>It was just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Wow.</v>

2997
02:24:51.820 --> 02:24:54.280
<v Speaker 15>That's one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 15>What happens on a party line.</v>

2998
02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:57.250
<v Speaker 15>He just talked to a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 15>That's incredible.</v>

2999
02:24:57.251 --> 02:24:59.590
<v Speaker 15>It's almost like it's the chat phone.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Internet.</v>

02:24:59.591 --> 02:25:00.030
<v Speaker 15>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 15>Some people contribute.</v>

3005
02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:16.440
<v Speaker 15>Some people will get off the people that</v>
<v Speaker 15>joined on and never called the party </v>

<v Speaker 1>I saw a show about a guy who got tricked</v>

3026
02:26:02.171 --> 02:26:04.720
<v Speaker 1>by these Nigerian scammers and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking sad.</v>

3027
02:26:04.930 --> 02:26:07.180
<v Speaker 1>This poor dude went to Europe twice.</v>

3028
02:26:07.450 --> 02:26:10.090
<v Speaker 1>He believed that this girl was waiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for them in Europe twice.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Loneliness sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sucks hard,</v>

3033
02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:25.730
<v Speaker 1>but that's how social media works on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

3034
02:26:26.190 --> 02:26:31.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just from back in the day when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to make those phone calls to those </v>

3036
02:26:31.260 --> 02:26:35.230
<v Speaker 1>It's just a way to connect without being</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of somebody and then that's why</v>

3037
02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:39.010
<v Speaker 1>facebook and my space is so successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>for was well,</v>

3039
02:26:44.011 --> 02:26:45.520
<v Speaker 1>that if they don't get sick physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get sick mentally.</v>

3040

<v Speaker 2>videos.</v>

3157
02:31:51.800 --> 02:31:54.650
<v Speaker 2>This is a girl named Amber Lynn in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties.</v>

3158
02:31:54.651 --> 02:31:57.560
<v Speaker 2>She was a monster.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know this dude that runs like charm </v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

3160
02:31:59.541 --> 02:32:03.500

<v Speaker 2>So he works with the federal government.</v>

3161
02:32:03.760 --> 02:32:08.760
<v Speaker 2>The FBI like to teach the agents how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>not get seduced by women.</v>

3162
02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:10.790

<v Speaker 2>So that's probably right because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful weapon.</v>

3165
02:32:18.681 --> 02:32:23.681
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to take down that at </v>

3166
02:32:23.681 --> 02:32:27.040
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take down anybody with a body </v>

3167
02:32:27.040 --> 02:32:27.040
<v Speaker 2>with a woman.</v>

3168
02:32:27.040 --> 02:32:27.040
<v Speaker 16>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Sex is.</v>

3169
02:32:27.040 --> 02:32:28.170
<v Speaker 16>It's so powerful to someone who can </v>
<v Speaker 16>acquire it.</v>

3170
02:32:28.171 --> 02:32:31.290
<v Speaker 16>It's like one of the most sweetest </v>
<v Speaker 16>nectar known.</v>

3171
02:32:31.570 --> 02:32:36.570
<v Speaker 16>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 16>if you can acquire it on a regular </v>

3172
02:32:36.570 --> 02:32:36.570
<v Speaker 16>basis,</v>
<v Speaker 16>it loses its power,</v>

3173
02:32:36.570 --> 02:32:36.600
<v Speaker 16>but it's just like getting your heroin </v>
<v Speaker 16>fix everyday.</v>

3174
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:37.340
<v Speaker 16>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 16>yeah,</v>

3175
02:32:37.430 --> 02:32:39.090

<v Speaker 16>It's just fucking heroin.</v>

3176
02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:42.560
<v Speaker 16>There's a lot of functional heroin users</v>
<v Speaker 16>who's a lot of functional sex addicts.</v>

3177
02:32:43.180 --> 02:32:46.830
<v Speaker 16>You know when you're involved with that </v>
<v Speaker 16>type of a crime.</v>

3178
02:32:46.831 --> 02:32:50.790
<v Speaker 16>That's why I always laugh when I read </v>
<v Speaker 16>about drug bust or something because the</v>

3179
02:32:50.791 --> 02:32:53.430
<v Speaker 16>general public doesn't know when you </v>
<v Speaker 16>have that.</v>

3180
02:32:53.660 --> 02:32:56.760
<v Speaker 16>When somebody is selling 80 kilos a </v>
<v Speaker 16>fucking month,</v>

3181
02:32:57.240 --> 02:32:59.240
<v Speaker 16>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 16>That'll make that many mistakes.</v>

3182
02:32:59.410 --> 02:33:02.550
<v Speaker 16>Right?</v>

02:38:14.391 --> 02:38:16.310
<v Speaker 7>we got bin Ladin.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3294
02:38:16.311 --> 02:38:18.530
<v Speaker 7>if he talked to the really crazy people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they say heroin.</v>

3295
02:38:19.730 --> 02:38:20.460
<v Speaker 7>Heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3296
02:38:20.530 --> 02:38:25.530
<v Speaker 7>They say heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The really a crazy conspiracy theory </v>

3297
02:38:25.530 --> 02:38:28.841
<v Speaker 7>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They say that it's all a big heroin </v>

3298
02:38:28.841 --> 02:38:28.841
<v Speaker 7>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3299
02:38:28.841 --> 02:38:33.671
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because like if you want to fund black </v>

3300
02:38:33.671 --> 02:38:35.470
<v Speaker 7>operations,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you do it with drug sales because it's </v>

3301
02:38:35.470 --> 02:38:38.171
<v Speaker 7>untraceable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if the CIO wants to do completely </v>

3302
02:38:38.171 --> 02:38:38.540
<v Speaker 7>untraceable operations,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they just blow.</v>

3303
02:38:38.541 --> 02:38:43.541
<v Speaker 7>They confiscated.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or when we had guys on from vice </v>

3304
02:38:43.541 --> 02:38:43.690
<v Speaker 7>vice.com,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they.</v>

3305
02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:48.700
<v Speaker 7>They were just saying that essentially </v>
<v Speaker 7>there's no other way it could be </v>

3306
02:38:48.700 --> 02:38:52.181
<v Speaker 7>happening because 90 plus percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>world's opium and heroin comes from </v>

3307
02:38:53.210 --> 02:38:58.210
<v Speaker 7>Afghanistan and we're in control of that</v>
<v Speaker 7>area and there's video footage of </v>

3308
02:38:58.210 --> 02:39:00.530
<v Speaker 7>soldiers that are actually like guarding</v>
<v Speaker 7>the fucking poppy fields.</v>

3309
02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:02.700
<v Speaker 7>It's craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like you look at it and you go,</v>

3310
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:04.490
<v Speaker 7>this bizarre shit.</v>

3311
02:39:04.730 --> 02:39:06.950
<v Speaker 7>How has this on television?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How is this real?</v>

3312
02:39:07.540 --> 02:39:12.540
<v Speaker 7>It's all the shit that people in </v>
<v Speaker 7>conspiracy theory chat rooms had been </v>

3313
02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:16.811
<v Speaker 7>saying forever and what's oxicon </v>
<v Speaker 7>synthetic heroin when you got all these </v>

3314
02:39:17.211 --> 02:39:19.350
<v Speaker 7>pills that will lose their minds over </v>
<v Speaker 7>heroin,</v>

3315
02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:22.220
<v Speaker 7>not dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How much about fucking profit?</v>

3316
02:39:22.580 --> 02:39:24.840
<v Speaker 7>I invest $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>a pound.</v>

3317
02:39:24.841 --> 02:39:26.990
<v Speaker 7>The heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I could chop that motherfucker,</v>

3318
02:39:27.430 --> 02:39:32.330
<v Speaker 7>don't make me make my profit 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I could walk out of there with $450,000</v>

3319
02:39:32.720 --> 02:39:37.720
<v Speaker 7>on a fucking kilo of heroin right now if</v>
<v Speaker 7>they could ever really proved that the </v>

3320
02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:39.890
<v Speaker 7>government has always been selling </v>
<v Speaker 7>heroin place.</v>

3321
02:39:40.010 --> 02:39:42.680
<v Speaker 7>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That would be insane times if you really</v>

3322
02:39:42.681 --> 02:39:43.860
<v Speaker 7>found that out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3323
02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:46.100
<v Speaker 7>when you say the government though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it's like it's not really.</v>

3324
02:39:46.101 --> 02:39:49.730
<v Speaker 7>They're all different branches and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like you can't really blame the FBI</v>

3325
02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:52.580
<v Speaker 7>if some dea guys are selling heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3326
02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:57.640
<v Speaker 7>you can't blame the NSA.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The CIA is doing something because it's </v>

3327
02:39:57.640 --> 02:40:00.260
<v Speaker 7>kind of all different organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But if we found out that one of them was</v>

3328
02:40:00.261 --> 02:40:05.261
<v Speaker 7>actually long term selling heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you watch,</v>
