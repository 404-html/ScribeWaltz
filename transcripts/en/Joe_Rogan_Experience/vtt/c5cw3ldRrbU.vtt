117
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 3>I handle somewhere between that too pissed and somewhat pissed.</v>

118
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.620
<v Speaker 2>That's how you idle your bullshit.</v>

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

151
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 3>would you listen to everybody else's idea behind while you're deliberating on</v>

152
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 3>this trial instead of certainly he said,</v>

153
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 3>but you would try to convince them they were wrong if you had another idea,</v>

154
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:22.391
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

155
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:23.224
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

156
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.711
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

157
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:24.544
<v Speaker 3>that's accurate.</v>

158
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.743
<v Speaker 3>And you dismiss it.</v>

159
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Charismatic,</v>

160
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.720
<v Speaker 2>charismatic.</v>

161
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.270
<v Speaker 2>You had manipulated in your favor.</v>

162
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

163
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.123
<v Speaker 2>you're the lever.</v>

164
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.480
<v Speaker 3>Certainly not my one.</v>

165
00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:39.830
<v Speaker 3>My first time in the Pasadena courthouse,</v>

166
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

167
00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:42.660
<v Speaker 3>when our first time was Alex van Halen,</v>

168
00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:47.661
<v Speaker 3>and I had to sue the Mayfield School of the holy child of Jesus Incorporated for</v>

169
00:04:47.911 --> 00:04:49.230
<v Speaker 3>$125.</v>

170
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.190
<v Speaker 3>This was in 1975,</v>

171
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:53.551
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

172
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:55.490
<v Speaker 3>1970 625.</v>

173
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.250
<v Speaker 3>What was that about?</v>

174
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.611
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

175
00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:57.810
<v Speaker 3>it was in a contract.</v>

176
00:04:57.811 --> 00:04:58.890
<v Speaker 3>We had played a,</v>

177
00:04:58.891 --> 00:04:59.551
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

178
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:04.230
<v Speaker 3>a dance and in the one page contract it said there will be no smoking,</v>

179
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

180
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.240
<v Speaker 3>backstage.</v>

181
00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:08.520
<v Speaker 3>There will be no marijuana consumed.</v>

182
00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:09.810
<v Speaker 3>There will be no drinking,</v>

183
00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:10.321
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>

184
00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:11.154
<v Speaker 3>cetera.</v>

185
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.910
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

186
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.060
<v Speaker 3>one of the sisters was nuns at the time,</v>

187
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.390
<v Speaker 3>claimed that she smelled pot smoke backstage and a refused to pass our hundred</v>

188
00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:22.710
<v Speaker 3>and $25 for the band.</v>

189
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.940
<v Speaker 3>So agree.</v>

190
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.301
<v Speaker 3>Bitch,</v>

191
00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:25.140
<v Speaker 3>was he she right?</v>

192
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

193
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.370
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

194
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.890
<v Speaker 3>there was no pot smoke,</v>

195
00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:28.200
<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>

196
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.033
<v Speaker 3>she's made it up.</v>

197
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.720
<v Speaker 3>She may have smelled Marlboro's actually those were Campbell Campbell filters.</v>

198
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.561
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

199
00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:35.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

200
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

201
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.260
<v Speaker 3>Alex and I went and we bought a clip on ties so we could fool the judge and we</v>

202
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:43.620
<v Speaker 3>tied our hair back and we went to small claims court and filed.</v>

203
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Did you win?</v>

204
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.173
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

205
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.541
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

206
00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:46.410
<v Speaker 3>what happened was,</v>

207
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

208
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.660
<v Speaker 3>sat in front of the judge.</v>

209
00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:50.520
<v Speaker 3>We sat on one side and on the other side,</v>

210
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:51.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

211
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.741
<v Speaker 3>two sisters,</v>

212
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:54.450
<v Speaker 3>two nuns came in and a family,</v>

213
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.141
<v Speaker 3>a father,</v>

214
00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:55.974
<v Speaker 3>a mother,</v>

215
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 3>and three of daughters in school uniforms.</v>

216
00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.001
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

217
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 3>they played it up hard.</v>

218
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.921
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

219
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:01.211
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

220
00:06:01.211 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 3>the judge says,</v>

221
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 3>why or who filed here?</v>

222
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:04.101
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

223
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:04.341
<v Speaker 3>sir,</v>

224
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:04.761
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

225
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 3>He said it was $125.</v>

226
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

227
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 3>there was no smoke,</v>

228
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.870
<v Speaker 3>there was no smoking of anything illegal backstage,</v>

229
00:06:12.871 --> 00:06:13.704
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

230
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.773
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

231
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.131
<v Speaker 3>he had the,</v>

232
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 3>one of the nuns stand up and she said,</v>

233
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 3>I refused to pay him because I smelled marijuana smoke.</v>

234
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.411
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

235
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

236
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.551
<v Speaker 3>the judge says,</v>

237
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 3>what is your answer to that?</v>

238
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:23.901
<v Speaker 3>Sarah?</v>

239
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 3>And I stood up and I said,</v>

240
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.993
<v Speaker 3>sister,</v>

241
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 3>how do you know what marijuana smoke smells like?</v>

242
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 3>$125 later</v>

243
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 3>paid for the t shirt.</v>

244
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

245
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:36.644
<v Speaker 3>How would she know?</v>

246
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.600
<v Speaker 3>I've heard you saying that you believe that consciousness is nonlocal.</v>

247
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.000
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>

248
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.990
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean by that?</v>

249
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.431
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

250
00:06:47.431 --> 00:06:48.940
<v Speaker 4>out of discontinuity.</v>

251
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.820
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

252
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.280
<v Speaker 4>you are already familiar with this.</v>

253
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.770
<v Speaker 4>Continuated now you want to know even the most,</v>

254
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.600
<v Speaker 4>most unfamiliar,</v>

255
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.850
<v Speaker 4>most intriguing,</v>

256
00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

257
00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.950
<v Speaker 4>they said this is like Voodoo.</v>

258
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.720
<v Speaker 4>This is really like Udo,</v>

259
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

260
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.500
<v Speaker 4>we're now getting into fail cracks up.</v>

261
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.800
<v Speaker 4>The most surprising thing in quantum physics that surprised you when Einstein,</v>

262
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:09.971
<v Speaker 4>Einstein,</v>

263
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:14.320
<v Speaker 4>and his whole life could not believe this concept of nonlocality,</v>

264
00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:17.050
<v Speaker 4>which he himself discovered with two other physicists,</v>

265
00:07:17.051 --> 00:07:17.650
<v Speaker 4>right and wrong.</v>

266
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.410
<v Speaker 4>How did they discover it or how to discover just theory,</v>

267
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

268
00:07:21.161 --> 00:07:22.480
<v Speaker 4>and standing what the tour addition,</v>

269
00:07:22.481 --> 00:07:23.314
<v Speaker 4>he never,</v>

270
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.820
<v Speaker 4>well I shouldn't say never.</v>

271
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.110
<v Speaker 4>They probably did experiments in his young days when he was a graduate student.</v>

272
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:31.863
<v Speaker 4>I did talk,</v>

273
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.210
<v Speaker 4>but tourists don't do an experiment.</v>

274
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.541
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

275
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:35.830
<v Speaker 4>What they do is this,</v>

276
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.740
<v Speaker 4>a creative exploration of the mind.</v>

277
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.990
<v Speaker 4>By that day they find new ideas,</v>

278
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.883
<v Speaker 4>new ideas,</v>

279
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.691
<v Speaker 4>and then the,</v>

280
00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:44.260
<v Speaker 4>then the predict stuff.</v>

281
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.340
<v Speaker 4>So Einstein's idea was this was 1935 mine.</v>

282
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.340
<v Speaker 4>Do I understand?</v>

283
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.800
<v Speaker 4>The idea was that if quantum objects took quantum objects interact,</v>

284
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.840
<v Speaker 4>they become correlated.</v>

285
00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:59.260
<v Speaker 4>And this is a new word that he used in that paper.</v>

286
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.640
<v Speaker 4>He and his collaborators,</v>

287
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.380
<v Speaker 4>Rosen and Podolsky.</v>

288
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:03.903
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

289
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.950
<v Speaker 4>these people that really sound in with their theory,</v>

290
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:09.970
<v Speaker 4>their mathematics,</v>

291
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.360
<v Speaker 4>that if two objects once become correlated,</v>

292
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:14.040
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

293
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.180
<v Speaker 4>even when they are not interacting,</v>

294
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.120
<v Speaker 4>even if they move away from each other,</v>

295
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.030
<v Speaker 4>even then they can communicate,</v>

296
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.370
<v Speaker 4>not in the usual way,</v>

297
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.650
<v Speaker 4>not interacting with signals,</v>

298
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:27.910
<v Speaker 4>then that still shrill.</v>

299
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.890
<v Speaker 4>You and I are interacting right now,</v>

300
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.240
<v Speaker 4>but we are interacting to a complexity of sound waves and electrical wires to</v>

301
00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:35.110
<v Speaker 4>this microphones.</v>

302
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.890
<v Speaker 4>That's all true signals.</v>

303
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.450
<v Speaker 4>But these objects communicate without signals.</v>

304
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.300
<v Speaker 4>So their communication,</v>

305
00:08:45.301 --> 00:08:50.050
<v Speaker 4>he was as a medium that can only be outside of space and time because in space</v>

306
00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:50.561
<v Speaker 4>and time,</v>

307
00:08:50.561 --> 00:08:53.770
<v Speaker 4>Einstein himself gave us the theory of relativity,</v>

308
00:08:53.771 --> 00:08:58.771
<v Speaker 4>which says that nothing can interact without exchanging signals going to space</v>

309
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:00.234
<v Speaker 4>and time.</v>

310
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.890
<v Speaker 4>But these objects,</v>

311
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 4>quantum objects,</v>

312
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 4>one scar related,</v>

313
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.020
<v Speaker 4>they have the capacity of signal less communication.</v>

314
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.560
<v Speaker 4>This is what is called [inaudible] local signals that local going to space</v>

315
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 4>taking it.</v>

316
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 4>How do they,</v>

317
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 4>how do they measure that these particles are communicating?</v>

318
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.720
<v Speaker 4>So the key is in that they measure the communication and the soul,</v>

319
00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 4>that there is no signal because the communication took place faster than the</v>

320
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:31.311
<v Speaker 4>speed of light in all local signals going to space and time must travel either</v>

321
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:35.370
<v Speaker 4>at the speed of light or less than the speed of light.</v>

322
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 4>So if something can be shown to travel faster than the speed of light,</v>

323
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 4>it has to be local.</v>

324
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:47.090
<v Speaker 4>And this is a 56 loud discovered into laboratory Atlanta stay in 1982 finally</v>

325
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 4>verified by Einstein was dead long time ago around 10 55 so he never knew that</v>

326
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 4>he's teary will one day not only prove to variety,</v>

327
00:09:57.541 --> 00:09:59.140
<v Speaker 4>but really the evolutionize,</v>

328
00:09:59.141 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 4>the whole world of physics by bringing in concepts of consciousness,</v>

329
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 4>the Joe Rogan experience</v>

330
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
