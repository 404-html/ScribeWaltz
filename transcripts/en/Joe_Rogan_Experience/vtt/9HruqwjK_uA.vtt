<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

64
00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:15.620
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

65
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.620
<v Speaker 1>that whole scenario is leading to so many different people getting in trouble</v>

66
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:24.410
<v Speaker 1>for domestic violence and reports of divesting violence.</v>

67
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.353
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

68
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Johnson,</v>

69
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.950
<v Speaker 1>one of the fighters in the UFC,</v>

70
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 1>God suspended just because there was just the,</v>

71
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>the possibility that may be something happened.</v>

72
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 1>So there's an inquiry.</v>

73
00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:37.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're going through a sea change right now.</v>

74
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.991
<v Speaker 1>And it's all about,</v>

76
00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I think because I have talked about this a little bit before,</v>

77
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>that it used to be you only knew the shit that you knew that was directly in</v>

78
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:46.041
<v Speaker 1>front of you,</v>

79
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:49.610
<v Speaker 1>that you want information you sought out or your friends brought to you.</v>

80
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>But now on Facebook and Twitter,</v>

81
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.630
<v Speaker 1>people are like finding of a ray rice who were like,</v>

82
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know there was a thing called the NFL,</v>

83
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.383
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

84
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody's getting everybody shit so that the NFL has had domestic</v>

85
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:02.060
<v Speaker 1>violence for,</v>

86
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:03.650
<v Speaker 1>since the dawn of the NFL.</v>

88
00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>And not that it's any worse than regular society,</v>

89
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:07.124
<v Speaker 1>but they've had it.</v>

90
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.650
<v Speaker 1>But now it's to the point where people who never were paying attention to the</v>

91
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>NFL are noticing it.</v>

92
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Also people are going and looking through the past of a lot of these different</v>

93
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

94
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I think whenever you're dealing with a bunch of like super athletes who are also</v>

96
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:26.240
<v Speaker 1>involved in an incredibly aggressive sport and you add in head trauma.</v>

97
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

98
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Repeated head trauma and a lot of them,</v>

99
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 1>like ray rice has said that that's how he was raised or that,</v>

100
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.471
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

102
00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:35.450
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't say it was a Peterson Peterson.</v>

103
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Adrian Peterson said that's how he was raised.</v>

104
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:41.330
<v Speaker 1>When you repeat getting knocked the fuck out the elevator.</v>

105
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:42.164
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Ray Rice Peterson.</v>

107
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

108
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:44.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

109
00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:44.661
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

110
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

111
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I've pulled the switch off a tree because I had to go get one,</v>

112
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.021
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

113
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

114
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.910
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have my nuts all cut up.</v>

115
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:50.091
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

116
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I think there's dead nuts.</v>

117
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.131
<v Speaker 1>That was the kid.</v>

118
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:52.970
<v Speaker 1>It was like that.</v>

119
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:53.540
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

120
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.171
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

121
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:58.670
<v Speaker 1>from what I read that there was actual like injuries on his genital area.</v>

122
00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

123
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'd like,</v>

124
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

125
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to testify in a court of law,</v>

126
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 2>but I heard that it was like,</v>

127
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's certainly,</v>

128
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 2>there's abuse and there's,</v>

129
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 2>and there's also discipline and we all that line is changing.</v>

130
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:08.721
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

131
00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 2>they were going through a sea change where everybody knows everybody shit now.</v>

132
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.861
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

133
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

134
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

135
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can hide,</v>

136
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 2>but we all had fucked up shit had to happen to us by our parents.</v>

137
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 2>But does mean you have to pass it on to the next know you don't got to pay it</v>

138
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

139
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.381
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

140
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

141
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:21.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

142
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:21.821
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>

143
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:22.421
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

144
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:25.660
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking about it lately that my parents were raised by immigrants,</v>

145
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 2>immigrants that came over from Italy and Ireland.</v>

146
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 2>And you know those people that came over here in the 1920s they were savages.</v>

147
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 2>They might as well been cave people,</v>

148
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

149
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 2>They got on these shitty boats.</v>

150
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.610
<v Speaker 2>It floated across the ocean,</v>

151
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.221
<v Speaker 2>took months.</v>

152
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:40.054
<v Speaker 2>They got over here,</v>

153
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.930
<v Speaker 2>they got their name change right away and immediately they started fucking and</v>

154
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.161
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

155
00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Now kids and then they raise those kids with their savage instincts in the</v>

156
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood that they're not allowed to leave because they have their accent</v>

157
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 2>was too thick and the weird food,</v>

158
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to leave that neighborhood at the point where Italians weren't</v>

159
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:55.684
<v Speaker 2>considered to be white.</v>

160
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.440
<v Speaker 2>People aren't white or you know,</v>

161
00:03:57.441 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 2>it was like Polish people are white and then eventually they lose.</v>

162
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 2>The accents are allowed to integrate into the rest of the of the city.</v>

163
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 2>I had a history professor on yesterday,</v>

164
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Thaddeus Russell who explained that exact same thing.</v>

165
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 2>You know how all these different cultures integrate into society and they're</v>

166
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:12.330
<v Speaker 2>considered non whites.</v>

167
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

168
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.711
<v Speaker 2>For the black folks.</v>

169
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

170
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 2>We don't get the integrated.</v>

171
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 2>While it was also his,</v>

172
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:23.000
<v Speaker 2>his take on it was the unique uh,</v>

173
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 2>aspect of America is that America was the,</v>

174
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 2>the country that had this puritan value system.</v>

175
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Like these people came over and he had this like really re repressive value</v>

176
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 2>system and very repressed society,</v>

177
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 2>but they also had slaves and the slaves didn't,</v>

178
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 2>they didn't accept any of that.</v>

179
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 2>And then they became part of the culture.</v>

180
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Radically influenced the art radically and for influenced the language.</v>

181
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:52.743
<v Speaker 2>Who the slaves,</v>

182
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.540
<v Speaker 2>the slaves did.</v>

183
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

184
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is one of the most unique things about America is the African</v>

185
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.480
<v Speaker 2>American influence and the western Africans integrating into this really fucked</v>

186
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 2>up puritan,</v>

187
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 2>very repressed society.</v>

188
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 2>And then you see in America,</v>

189
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 2>like 90% of all entertainment comes out of here.</v>

190
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

191
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 2>a massive amount of innovation comes out of here.</v>

192
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.870
<v Speaker 2>A massive difference in the way we speak English as opposed to the way English</v>

193
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 2>people speak English.</v>

194
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 2>It's so many variables that that came out of that.</v>

195
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 2>And it makes you think like how much of it kind of bringing it all back to the</v>

196
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:29.074
<v Speaker 2>Peterson thing,</v>

197
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 2>beaten as kids.</v>

198
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 2>How much of the way human beings live our lives is based just on the momentum of</v>

199
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 2>the people that came before us,</v>

200
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.160
<v Speaker 2>whether it's his parents had been him or some fucking weird puritanical society</v>

201
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:44.230
<v Speaker 2>that you just unluckily we're born into.</v>

202
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

203
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.190
<v Speaker 2>well there's,</v>

204
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.341
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

205
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:46.174
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that is,</v>

206
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

207
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.333
<v Speaker 2>there's that,</v>

208
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I certainly understand that we,</v>

209
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

210
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.160
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

211
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

212
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.280
<v Speaker 2>all this fucked up.</v>

213
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 2>Things happened to us in our childhood.</v>

214
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:53.621
<v Speaker 2>Some of us go,</v>

215
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 2>I got to put a stop to this.</v>

216
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:55.391
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

217
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:55.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

218
00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 2>that you make the choice to go,</v>

219
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 2>I got to break the cycle.</v>

220
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's in big ways like,</v>

221
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to college.</v>

222
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:01.461
<v Speaker 1>Nobody went to college.</v>

223
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's like,</v>

224
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to slap my kid in the nuts.</v>

225
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:04.101
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

226
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Like it just,</v>

227
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stick.</v>

228
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to him.</v>

229
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

230
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:07.131
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

231
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:10.060
<v Speaker 1>and certainly I was whooped as a kid by different things.</v>

232
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

233
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>I always say my,</v>

234
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 1>one of my grandmother's favorite stories was to talk about how she beat me with</v>

235
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:14.204
<v Speaker 1>a shoe one time.</v>

236
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>And that was thanksgiving.</v>

237
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Everybody sit down and let's hear the beat with the shoe story.</v>

238
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>That was not like a in therapy.</v>

239
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:21.741
<v Speaker 1>She told that story.</v>

240
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

241
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.641
<v Speaker 1>hey grandma,</v>

242
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>tell her how you beat me with a shoe story again.</v>

243
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 1>And everybody would laugh and you know,</v>

244
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 1>and it was a good southern time.</v>

245
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>What was the cause?</v>

246
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>What did you do that made her beat you in a shoe?</v>

247
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.411
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

248
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:33.950

274
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

275
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.441
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

276
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 1>when they're starting to,</v>

277
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:08.624
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

278
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>sort of find themselves when they're starting to establish their own identity,</v>

279
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things they do is a immediately try to challenge the way you</v>

280
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.540
<v Speaker 1>discipline them and the way you,</v>

281
00:07:18.541 --> 00:07:19.341
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

282

294
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

295
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.680
<v Speaker 1>It's time to eat.</v>

296
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

297
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I want to watch the show and it's not,</v>

298
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:33.651
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

299
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:34.860
<v Speaker 1>I want to watch show there's no,</v>

300
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

301
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.381
<v Speaker 1>we're not negotiating.</v>

302
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:36.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

303
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 1>This is just what's going to happen.</v>

304
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.863
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get shut off.</v>

305
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

306
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.293
<v Speaker 1>No angry.</v>

307
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

308
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 1>I stand by.</v>

309
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that testing authority.</v>

310
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 1>I just did.</v>

311
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.193
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't hear.</v>

312
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.851
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

313
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:47.684
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

314
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.753
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

315
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.160
<v Speaker 1>it was entrapment was entrapment.</v>

316
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

317
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:51.821
<v Speaker 1>and button.</v>

318
00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Then it,</v>

319
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.580
<v Speaker 1>and then it became every year the story was told is like the,</v>

320
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

321
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.190
<v Speaker 1>the bell holiday story.</v>

322
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:58.640
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>

323
00:07:58.641 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Then it fun to beat kids with shoes.</v>

324
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.243
<v Speaker 1>It was fun,</v>

325
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.120
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

326
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 1>And I worked out pretty well,</v>

327
00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:03.630
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

328
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

329
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:04.761
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

330
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:05.594
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't happen.</v>

331
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 1>It didn't happen every day.</v>

332
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:07.581
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a,</v>

333
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:08.330
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like the,</v>

334
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.901
<v Speaker 1>here's my time,</v>

335
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 1>we get beat,</v>

336
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.950
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly was the thing that I remember and I'm not going to do that to</v>

337
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:13.690
<v Speaker 1>my daughter.</v>

338
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:14.190
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

339
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:14.630
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

340
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.310
<v Speaker 1>there's no shoe beating happening in my house.</v>

341
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

343
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

344
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>it's sick.</v>

345
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.391
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

346
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:21.320
<v Speaker 1>when you see,</v>

347
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.890
<v Speaker 1>like I saw the pictures of just his kid's leg that were beat with the switch.</v>

348
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a sick thing.</v>

349
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

350
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like beating a kid.</v>

351
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not the way to raise a kid.</v>

352
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

353
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I think there's,</v>

354
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 1>there's that as a pinos apparent.</v>

355
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.020
<v Speaker 1>There's times when you do grab your key,</v>

356
00:08:34.021 --> 00:08:34.551
<v Speaker 1>you might grab,</v>

357
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:35.271
<v Speaker 1>you can't cause you're like,</v>

358
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:37.010
<v Speaker 1>don't touch that or don't do that,</v>

359
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 1>or you're going to get hurt and I need to get your attention.</v>

360
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

361
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.731
<v Speaker 1>my daughter's cool,</v>

362
00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:41.421
<v Speaker 1>but if I yell,</v>

363
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:41.871
<v Speaker 1>she gets like,</v>

364
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 1>you Yo,</v>

365
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.333
<v Speaker 1>good me.</v>

366
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.240
<v Speaker 1>And then I feel bad.</v>

367
00:08:45.241 --> 00:08:45.651
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

368
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:46.041
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

369
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:47.660
<v Speaker 1>that's a different era.</v>

370
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

371
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:49.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

372
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:50.240
<v Speaker 1>We're raising babies.</v>

373
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

374
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

375
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.031
<v Speaker 1>It's a softer,</v>

376
00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:53.801
<v Speaker 1>friendlier world.</v>

377
00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Well we're getting to it is,</v>

378
00:08:55.231 --> 00:08:55.940
<v Speaker 1>and I just,</v>

379
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

380
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

381
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I liked that aspect of it.</v>

382
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I liked that we're becoming more aware of the negative impact.</v>

383
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we didn't learn from the,</v>

384
00:09:03.891 --> 00:09:06.630
<v Speaker 1>the fucked up shit that our parents and grandparents did to us,</v>

385
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 1>then we would really be idiots.</v>

386
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole point is that we're evolving.</v>

387
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.181
<v Speaker 1>We have to go,</v>

388
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:14.580
<v Speaker 1>they did that and I'm going to try to do something one better.</v>

389
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 1>And I think specifically the culture of athletes is that if you're a</v>

390
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:19.321
<v Speaker 1>professional athlete,</v>

391
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:23.250
<v Speaker 1>you've probably been coddled since you were in high school and been told and</v>

392
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 1>you've been given a different set of rules to live by.</v>

393
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.950
<v Speaker 1>So that somebody who grew up with ray rice,</v>

394
00:09:27.951 --> 00:09:28.760
<v Speaker 1>he maybe came out of seeing him.</v>

395
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.550
<v Speaker 1>It may not be doing the things he's doing cause they work at fucking Walmart and</v>

396
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:35.160
<v Speaker 1>they're not allowed to tell people what the fuck they think all the time and</v>

397
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 1>then allowed to do those things.</v>

398
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:40.020
<v Speaker 1>But Ray rice as a professional athlete as a star is living by a completely</v>

399
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:40.860
<v Speaker 1>different set of rules.</v>

400
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 1>And what happens to a guy like that and now he's kind of fucked.</v>

401
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

402
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 1>you know Michael Vick was supposed to be fucked too.</v>

403
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:49.890
<v Speaker 1>I think if there America likes a comeback,</v>

404
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.070
<v Speaker 1>do you don't suppose nobody was more fucked than Mike Tyson was when he,</v>

405
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 1>when he was convicted for raping,</v>

406
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:56.890
<v Speaker 1>went to jail and he's sent,</v>

407
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.601
<v Speaker 1>seemed to come out of that.</v>

408
00:09:57.601 --> 00:09:57.991
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

409
00:09:57.991 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 1>America likes to come back.</v>

410
00:09:59.130 --> 00:09:59.880
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>

411
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.420
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>

412
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.390
<v Speaker 1>If he does the things that allow him to,</v>

413
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:03.931
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

414
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Like if he,</v>

415
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.240
<v Speaker 1>like I always think about tiger woods.</v>

416
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.810
<v Speaker 1>America hasn't accepted him back because they were unfortunately can't go to</v>

417
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:11.280
<v Speaker 1>jail for cheating on your wife.</v>

418
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Like if he could have gone to jail and then like people are like,</v>

419
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:14.971
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

420
00:10:14.971 --> 00:10:17.910
<v Speaker 1>he was in jail for 18 months right now we'll let them come back.</v>

421
00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:18.421
<v Speaker 1>But we're still,</v>

422
00:10:18.421 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 1>people are still judging him for what he did.</v>

423
00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine how happy women would be if a guy could go to jail for</v>

424
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:23.874
<v Speaker 1>cheating on his wife?</v>

425
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.150
<v Speaker 1>And it was so excited.</v>

426
00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.590
<v Speaker 1>They would be blogs written every day.</v>

427
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.550
<v Speaker 1>What were women would be recounting stories from highschool asking their</v>

428
00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:34.560
<v Speaker 1>boyfriends to be put back in jail.</v>

429
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

430
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:35.671
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>

431
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 1>it happened a decade ago.</v>

432
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.111
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

433
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:37.540
<v Speaker 1>they would be,</v>

434
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:41.580
<v Speaker 1>their professional victim crusade would be out in full force.</v>

435
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.061
<v Speaker 1>They had no,</v>

436
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:42.301
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

437
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:42.751
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

438
00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:43.351
<v Speaker 1>but you can't,</v>

439
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 1>since you can't do that,</v>

440
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 1>tiger woods is still walking around with his head down,</v>

441
00:10:46.081 --> 00:10:46.610
<v Speaker 1>like going,</v>

442
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:47.430
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

443
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.551
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

444
00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:48.384
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

445
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.223
<v Speaker 1>I was on an airplane.</v>

446
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.100
<v Speaker 1>It was really funny.</v>

447
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.551
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

448
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:50.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

449
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.700
<v Speaker 1>there was this guy and his wife and they were in front of us and,</v>

450
00:10:53.701 --> 00:10:54.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

451
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:54.811
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

452
00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:55.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

453
00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:00.210
<v Speaker 1>the guy was going over the golf score and the woman had like a golf a visor on.</v>

454
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:01.770
<v Speaker 1>So I guess they probably both played golf.</v>

455
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.380
<v Speaker 1>And the guy was going over there and he goes like this.</v>

456
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:04.651
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

457
00:11:04.651 --> 00:11:05.310
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

458
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.671
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

459
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:06.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

460
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:06.781
<v Speaker 1>tiger,</v>

461
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

462
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 1>blew it in the whatever round.</v>

463
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:09.201
<v Speaker 1>I don't follow golf.</v>

464
00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:10.034
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it works.</v>

465
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.973
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

466
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.000
<v Speaker 1>of course he did.</v>

467
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.710
<v Speaker 1>What have you done lately?</v>

468
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Really shitting on tiger woods.</v>

469
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Golfers the fuck saying has ever known you can't,</v>

470
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.210
<v Speaker 1>tiger unfortunately did not go to jail for it.</v>

471
00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:29.460
<v Speaker 1>So he can never really recover from it unless he,</v>

472
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

473
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:30.620
<v Speaker 1>his wife,</v>

474
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 1>if his wife had stayed with him then they would have been like,</v>

475
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:33.301
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

476
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:36.540
<v Speaker 1>they worked it out because his wife left him as I understand,</v>

477
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:37.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.580
<v Speaker 1>you get to like 1415 women,</v>

479
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:38.800
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

480
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I think this isn't working out and then,</v>

481
00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:41.940
<v Speaker 1>but he can't,</v>

482
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.400
<v Speaker 1>there's no like there's no thing to do.</v>

483
00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:44.761
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>

484
00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:47.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not like even with Coby where like the court case ended,</v>

485
00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:48.930
<v Speaker 1>whether you believe it ended to the right way,</v>

486
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.250
<v Speaker 1>it was at least resolved.</v>

487
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:50.701
<v Speaker 1>So there's was like,</v>

488
00:11:50.701 --> 00:11:50.891
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

489
00:11:50.891 --> 00:11:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I can just play in Nike.</v>

490
00:11:51.771 --> 00:11:52.021
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

491
00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:52.231
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

492
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:53.380
<v Speaker 1>well fuck with you now.</v>

493
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.030
<v Speaker 1>You know you can come back in the fold.</v>

494
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.540
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

495
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.420
<v Speaker 1>and especially cause tiger is not as good as he was before that,</v>

496
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.730
<v Speaker 1>which is really shocking.</v>

497
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

498
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's mental.</v>

499
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it's totally like,</v>

500
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.151
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>

501
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:04.630
<v Speaker 1>He didn't.</v>

502
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.740
<v Speaker 1>I think he knows and I mean,</v>

503
00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:06.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know tiger woods at all,</v>

504
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 1>but I just feel like the thing,</v>

505
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I've been that guy where you're like,</v>

506
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up and there's no way to get out.</v>

507
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I just got to sit in my juices for a while and hope it passes.</v>

508
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:15.221
<v Speaker 1>Well also,</v>

509
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think either one of us could ever understand what it's like to be a that</v>

510
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:21.340
<v Speaker 1>famous and be that hated.</v>

511
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

512
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:22.743
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

513
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.810
<v Speaker 1>And it started when you were 19 you know,</v>

514
00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing to me about the same as professional athletes.</v>

515
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.020
<v Speaker 1>You became famous before your brain was for,</v>

516
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.870
<v Speaker 1>your fucking still has a soft spot,</v>

517
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.733
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

518
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

519
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:34.803
<v Speaker 1>We were all,</v>

520
00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 1>you were not a full grown.</v>

521
00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:37.150
<v Speaker 1>You've already been full girl.</v>

522
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:37.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

523
00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:38.770
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even have your man wait on you.</v>

524
00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

525
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Shoulders yet,</v>

526
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

527
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.730
<v Speaker 1>and suddenly one of those famous people on the planet.</v>

528
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.500
<v Speaker 1>I understand why on his side,</v>

529
00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:45.210
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

530
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:45.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

531
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.970
<v Speaker 1>as a kid who was a nerd and went to Stanford and his calm and his dad has been</v>

532
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 1>to play golf forever,</v>

533
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.500
<v Speaker 1>that he was like,</v>

534
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like to have sex with lots of women.</v>

535
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I just never had that chance.</v>

536
00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 1>And I know I got married and that was probably a dumb idea,</v>

537
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 1>but I get that.</v>

538
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 1>But then you can't,</v>

539
00:12:57.821 --> 00:12:58.654
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

540
00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:58.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

541
00:12:58.991 --> 00:12:59.241
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

542
00:12:59.241 --> 00:12:59.680
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

543
00:12:59.680 --> 00:12:59.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

544
00:12:59.951 --> 00:13:00.784
<v Speaker 1>he got caught.</v>

545
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

546
00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:01.781
<v Speaker 1>there's also,</v>

547
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I think this is just speculation,</v>

548
00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:08.440
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's all of this is [inaudible] with me as well.</v>

549
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

550
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing that goes along with being a great athlete.</v>

551
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.310
<v Speaker 1>There's like this conquer mentality.</v>

552
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Like they can't be beaten.</v>

553
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:18.723
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

554
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Ali screaming,</v>

555
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm a greatest of all time.</v>

556
00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:23.890
<v Speaker 1>When he did that,</v>

557
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:25.060
<v Speaker 1>everybody loved it.</v>

558
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:25.923
<v Speaker 1>They love it.</v>

559
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Half the people loved it and half the people thought we need to.</v>

560
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

561
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.830
<v Speaker 1>We need to draft him into the military and force him to be our bitch.</v>

562
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

563
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:33.920
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

564
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.920
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean try not to say that word,</v>

565
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:36.311

<v Speaker 1>Don't let them get you bro.</v>

576
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.701
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

577
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:45.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not a bunch of female dog.</v>

578
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:45.580
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

579

582
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:47.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

583
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:48.010
<v Speaker 1>a slur for women.</v>

584
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.700
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

585
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.780
<v Speaker 1>but not always.</v>

586
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of times square for men.</v>

587
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Well that it's become that just like nigger is not always a slur for black</v>

588
00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:54.941
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

589
00:13:54.941 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 1>It's also dude over there.</v>

590
00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 1>But you're allowed to call him.</v>

591
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:00.070

594
00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:02.720

597
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I got nervous even here to come out of my own mouth.</v>

598
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:07.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

599
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:07.834
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

600
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

602
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Like that's fine.</v>

603
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not telling you,</v>

604
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.233
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to,</v>

605
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:13.990
<v Speaker 1>you personally.</v>

606
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.291
<v Speaker 1>That's my,</v>

607
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:14.471
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

608
00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:14.801
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

609
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:15.631
<v Speaker 1>this is how I,</v>

610
00:14:15.631 --> 00:14:16.464
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

611
00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.750
<v Speaker 1>they got you got up,</v>

612
00:14:18.751 --> 00:14:19.840
<v Speaker 1>but they may be already had me.</v>

613
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.310
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to go my past and be like,</v>

614
00:14:24.311 --> 00:14:24.551
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

615
00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:25.440
<v Speaker 1>he used to have,</v>

616
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.590
<v Speaker 1>he was the bitch guy.</v>

617
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Look at the amount of pitches he used.</v>

618
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

619
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

620
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.460
<v Speaker 1>It's really scaled back.</v>

621
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:31.840
<v Speaker 1>No one from three to zero.</v>

622
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I say other words,</v>

623
00:14:34.391 --> 00:14:35.560
<v Speaker 1>I say nigger a lot.</v>

624
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.981
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

625
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:36.814
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I can,</v>

626
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.100
<v Speaker 1>but I don't say that in a way where like I would never,</v>

627
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.200
<v Speaker 1>I would only jokingly say to my black friend,</v>

628
00:14:41.201 --> 00:14:41.791
<v Speaker 1>what's up my Nigga?</v>

629
00:14:41.791 --> 00:14:42.624
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that.</v>

630
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't call him that.</v>

631
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.411
<v Speaker 1>And I talk about,</v>

632
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I use the word nigger on stage a lot cause I'm talking about it,</v>

633
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:46.810
<v Speaker 1>but I'm right.</v>

634
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:47.490
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not,</v>

635
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not the word police,</v>

636
00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:51.540
<v Speaker 1>it's just we all just have our own set of rules that we established.</v>

637
00:14:51.541 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 1>So thrown off by your refusal of the word bitch that I forgot what it is,</v>

638
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 1>what my entire point was going to be.</v>

639
00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:58.340
<v Speaker 1>That's my,</v>

640
00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.270
<v Speaker 1>that's my goal.</v>

641
00:14:59.330 --> 00:14:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

642
00:14:59.630 --> 00:14:59.951
<v Speaker 1>I've got this,</v>

643
00:14:59.951 --> 00:15:00.260
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

644
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.093
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

645
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:01.731
<v Speaker 1>when the cage,</v>

646
00:15:01.731 --> 00:15:03.630
<v Speaker 1>I gotta make sure you use your nervous gasket.</v>

647
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a good move.</v>

648
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

649
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.290
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about,</v>

650
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

651
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.480
<v Speaker 1>oh Muhammad Ali,</v>

652
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:09.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm the greatest of all time.</v>

653
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:10.521
<v Speaker 1>And I was just saying that like,</v>

654
00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:11.181
<v Speaker 1>some people loved it,</v>

655
00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:11.820
<v Speaker 1>some people hate it.</v>

656
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.130
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't no doubt.</v>

657
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.170
<v Speaker 1>And the DIS,</v>

658
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.390
<v Speaker 1>the people love that conqueror mindset.</v>

659
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.400
<v Speaker 1>They love the person who's extremely confident.</v>

660
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.731
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

661
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:22.370
<v Speaker 1>they love love like Mike Tyson when he was in his prime.</v>

662
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

663
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.421
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>

664
00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:23.810
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

665
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:24.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

666
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.610
<v Speaker 1>there's something about a guy who's at his best who thinks he can do whatever</v>

667
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:31.040
<v Speaker 1>the fuck he wants and then keeps pulling it off.</v>

668
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:32.660
<v Speaker 1>The people that love to see him fail,</v>

669
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.370
<v Speaker 1>but they also love to see them succeed.</v>

670
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.350
<v Speaker 1>But then some people love to hate that guy,</v>

671
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.350
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

672
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:38.340
<v Speaker 1>So if that's there,</v>

673
00:15:38.341 --> 00:15:38.720
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

674
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.220
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

675
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.053
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

676
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.180
<v Speaker 1>it's true of all these guys.</v>

677
00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:41.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

678
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

679
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

680
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones thing,</v>

681
00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:43.300
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

682
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:43.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

683
00:15:43.571 --> 00:15:44.880
<v Speaker 1>The people also get God,</v>

684
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:45.950
<v Speaker 1>why is he so good?</v>

685
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

686
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.280
<v Speaker 1>hate the hate that.</v>

687
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Hate that.</v>

688
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.501
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that.</v>

689
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:49.210
<v Speaker 1>He's so good.</v>

690
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

691
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt there's a,</v>

692
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:51.920
<v Speaker 1>there's an issue with that,</v>

693
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:57.130
<v Speaker 1>but I speculate on what it's like to be that guy when you are that good at</v>

694
00:15:57.651 --> 00:15:58.730
<v Speaker 1>something like golf,</v>

695
00:15:58.731 --> 00:16:03.080
<v Speaker 1>like a guy like tiger woods who was arguably the greatest golfer of all time or</v>

696
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:04.320
<v Speaker 1>right up there with them.</v>

697
00:16:04.321 --> 00:16:05.154
<v Speaker 1>I mean for the,</v>

698
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.410
<v Speaker 1>the time when he was on a roll,</v>

699
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:07.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a golf historian,</v>

700
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.890
<v Speaker 1>but as he had like a,</v>

701
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.550
<v Speaker 1>like a 10 year run where it was just like that we had was almost,</v>

702
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it was unparalleled where he just,</v>

703
00:16:15.201 --> 00:16:15.980
<v Speaker 1>where he,</v>

704
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:20.180
<v Speaker 1>he was going to be competitive every weekend and he played golf and he was going</v>

705
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:20.301
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

706
00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:20.961
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't ever going to,</v>

707
00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:21.950
<v Speaker 1>he was always going to make the cut.</v>

708
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.630
<v Speaker 1>And golfers I know enough that they,</v>

709
00:16:23.631 --> 00:16:24.560
<v Speaker 1>there's wild swings.</v>

710
00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Like a guy who wins one week may not make the cut the next week.</v>

711
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:28.070
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly mental.</v>

712
00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:28.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's left physical,</v>

713
00:16:28.851 --> 00:16:31.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's also you have to hold yourself together and recover.</v>

714
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.020
<v Speaker 1>And so there's wild swings in golf and he had an amazing consistency that even</v>

715
00:16:36.021 --> 00:16:36.351
<v Speaker 1>if he didn't,</v>

716
00:16:36.351 --> 00:16:41.351
<v Speaker 1>when he was in the top 10 and then all of a sudden that went away because it's</v>

717
00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:42.591
<v Speaker 1>mental,</v>

718
00:16:42.591 --> 00:16:42.980
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

719
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:43.131
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

720
00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:43.990
<v Speaker 1>like all sports is,</v>

721
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:44.991
<v Speaker 1>everything is mental.</v>

722
00:16:44.991 --> 00:16:46.970
<v Speaker 1>But I think in that with golf especially,</v>

723
00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:48.260
<v Speaker 1>like if you're,</v>

724
00:16:48.261 --> 00:16:48.830
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

725
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:49.131
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

726
00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:50.540
<v Speaker 1>if you're not mentally in the thing,</v>

727
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.381
<v Speaker 1>you can't do the thing.</v>

728
00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:53.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not about your physical gifts.</v>

729
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:53.751
<v Speaker 1>He's still strong.</v>

730
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:56.330
<v Speaker 1>He's still bigger than everybody does have physical issues too.</v>

731
00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Now though doesn't he does a lot of problems and knee problems and stuff.</v>

732
00:16:59.480 --> 00:16:59.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

733
00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:00.140
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>

734
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 1>He does,</v>

735
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of that stuff and you know,</v>

736
00:17:02.241 --> 00:17:03.890
<v Speaker 1>but he's still not too old too.</v>

737
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

738
00:17:04.161 --> 00:17:07.250
<v Speaker 1>you know tigers at the age that most golfers are sometimes in their prime,</v>

739
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:10.790
<v Speaker 1>like in that like sort of late thirties this is when he should be good.</v>

740
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Not Back.</v>

741
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:13.251
<v Speaker 1>But you know he's also,</v>

742
00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:13.870
<v Speaker 1>he put,</v>

743
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:16.970
<v Speaker 1>he though he was the first Gulf to put muscle on and really work out.</v>

744
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.103
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you know,</v>

745
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.170
<v Speaker 1>if you put too much muscle on you can fuck yourself up eventually.</v>

746
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:21.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

747
00:17:21.531 --> 00:17:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Well then also fucks up your,</v>

748
00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:23.870
<v Speaker 1>your coordination.</v>

749
00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes like with pool players,</v>

750
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.380
<v Speaker 1>I play a lot of pool and pool players.</v>

751
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:29.480
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happens to them is they lift a lot of weights.</v>

752
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.830
<v Speaker 1>If they start lifting weights,</v>

753
00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:33.350
<v Speaker 1>they start getting like really tense pool players,</v>

754
00:17:33.351 --> 00:17:34.184
<v Speaker 1>lift weights.</v>

755
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.053
<v Speaker 1>That's a thing</v>

756
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.200
<v Speaker 1>we'll place and trying to be more fit because of being more fit gives you more</v>

757
00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:39.621
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

758
00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

759
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.761
<v Speaker 1>Longer matches.</v>

760
00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:41.301
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

761
00:17:41.301 --> 00:17:42.710
<v Speaker 1>And you can maintain your concentration.</v>

762
00:17:42.711 --> 00:17:44.240
<v Speaker 1>I know it seems counterintuitive.</v>

763
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I get that you would like want to be in good shape but being buffed to play</v>

764
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:48.140
<v Speaker 1>pool,</v>

765
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:48.381
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

766
00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:48.990
<v Speaker 1>that would be,</v>

767
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of tough but</v>

768
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:55.050
<v Speaker 2>strong your core and you're like a lot of times pool players develop back issues</v>

769
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:56.430
<v Speaker 2>because you're bending over all the time.</v>

770
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.421
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

771
00:17:57.421 --> 00:17:57.691
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

772
00:17:57.691 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 2>just the idea that you're lifting weights to keep your body strong,</v>

773
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:01.051
<v Speaker 2>but in doing so,</v>

774
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:05.280
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you'd create all this tension and then that tension fucks up your feel</v>

775
00:18:05.281 --> 00:18:06.450
<v Speaker 2>for where the ball's going.</v>

776
00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 2>And I would imagine the guy like tiger started getting pretty buff.</v>

777
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

778
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.680
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of that in like how you knock a ball around on a golf course as</v>

779
00:18:13.681 --> 00:18:13.921
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

780
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

781
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 2>It's just that delicate touch.</v>

782
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

783
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.310
<v Speaker 2>That it's fair that it's a lot of uh,</v>

784
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.450
<v Speaker 2>fast twitching and let attention and releasing and yeah,</v>

785
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.920
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy named Willie hoppies,</v>

786
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.040
<v Speaker 2>like a famous billiards player from the early 19 hundreds,</v>

787
00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:28.350
<v Speaker 2>like one of the all time greats.</v>

788
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:29.580
<v Speaker 2>And he wouldn't even drive a car,</v>

789
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.390
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't even do anything with his hands until he got to that table.</v>

790
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.051
<v Speaker 2>Just didn't,</v>

791
00:18:34.051 --> 00:18:35.280
<v Speaker 2>didn't touch anything,</v>

792
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.130
<v Speaker 2>just like would eat his food and just no tension at all.</v>

793
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.370
<v Speaker 2>He wanted his arms to be delicate and loose,</v>

794
00:18:40.371 --> 00:18:43.200
<v Speaker 2>so he had a full control where the ball was going at all times.</v>

795
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.740
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could do that with the comedy.</v>

796
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:45.811
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

797
00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:48.060
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk and just got to sit here and be in a,</v>

798
00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:48.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

799
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

800
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Some people like that,</v>

801
00:18:49.891 --> 00:18:50.101
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

802
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Some people rest their voice and shit and they drink</v>

803
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:54.600
<v Speaker 2>like before the show.</v>

804
00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I do like to do a thing where it's like,</v>

805
00:18:55.831 --> 00:18:57.150
<v Speaker 2>just don't talk to me for an hour.</v>

806
00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:57.961
<v Speaker 2>If it's a big show,</v>

807
00:18:57.961 --> 00:18:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I do like the shit.</v>

808
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:59.940
<v Speaker 2>I like to shut it down.</v>

809
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.960
<v Speaker 2>I do the opposite.</v>

810
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

811
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:01.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

812
00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:02.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

813
00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:02.741
<v Speaker 2>When it's a big shot,</v>

814
00:19:02.741 --> 00:19:04.260
<v Speaker 2>I like to talk a lot and have fun.</v>

815
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

816
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Speaker 2>So that when I go out there,</v>

817
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:06.894
<v Speaker 2>I'm loose.</v>

818
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a good time.</v>

819
00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.181
<v Speaker 2>I guess it depends.</v>

820
00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Last night I did Largo and I d I had the other comics backstage and we were</v>

821
00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:12.840
<v Speaker 2>talking,</v>

822
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.540
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was because I want to do that because there was a lot of industry</v>

823
00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:18.330
<v Speaker 2>people out there and I just didn't want it to focus too much on the fact that</v>

824
00:19:18.331 --> 00:19:18.840
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

825
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:18.961
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

826
00:19:18.961 --> 00:19:20.040
<v Speaker 2>this is just my career,</v>

827
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:20.530
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

828
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

829
00:19:21.521 --> 00:19:22.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

830
00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 2>People paying attention to you and staring at you.</v>

831
00:19:23.911 --> 00:19:24.181
<v Speaker 2>What do we,</v>

832

833

834
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.203
<v Speaker 2>It's Hildy.</v>

838
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.490
<v Speaker 2>neighbor,</v>

839
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.310
<v Speaker 2>the wacky neighbor that cosmo Kramer is his way into the room and see the</v>

840
00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:38.651
<v Speaker 2>feature.</v>

841
00:19:38.651 --> 00:19:38.821
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

842

<v Speaker 2>Comes in for six episodes and everybody loves it.</v>

843
00:19:40.951 --> 00:19:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't want to see him too much.</v>

844
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

845
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.313
<v Speaker 2>It could be that.</v>

846
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

847
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.150
<v Speaker 2>We can't overstate as welcome.</v>

848
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.920
<v Speaker 2>You had an awesome show man.</v>

849
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.080
<v Speaker 2>You had a really good show,</v>

850
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.120
<v Speaker 2>a groundbreaking show that for some reason some fucking suits decided they</v>

851
00:19:53.671 --> 00:19:57.450
<v Speaker 2>should take it from the very profitable FX and Fx,</v>

852
00:19:57.451 --> 00:19:57.681
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>

853
00:19:57.681 --> 00:19:57.991
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>

854
00:19:57.991 --> 00:19:58.291
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>

855
00:19:58.291 --> 00:19:59.040
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>

856
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.820
<v Speaker 2>which nobody even was informed was a real channel.</v>

857
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.691
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

858
00:20:03.691 --> 00:20:04.200
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

859
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.441
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

860
00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:04.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

861
00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:05.634
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

862
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm better for the show having happened.</v>

863
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.180
<v Speaker 2>I certainly feel like a little bit,</v>

864
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.900
<v Speaker 2>the show getting canceled and sent way made it a better story for people.</v>

865
00:20:12.901 --> 00:20:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Like you have now become like Woodstock,</v>

866
00:20:14.461 --> 00:20:16.350
<v Speaker 2>like more people claiming they were there then were there,</v>

867
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 2>I watched it occasionally,</v>

868
00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:19.981
<v Speaker 2>like we were like,</v>

869
00:20:19.981 --> 00:20:21.320
<v Speaker 2>I was there every night and I couldn't.</v>

870
00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:21.841
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>

871
00:20:21.841 --> 00:20:22.674
<v Speaker 2>but now people,</v>

872
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.730
<v Speaker 2>when it was gone,</v>

873
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.960
<v Speaker 2>people got more,</v>

874
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.990
<v Speaker 2>it got more attention for it being gone and,</v>

875
00:20:26.991 --> 00:20:28.230
<v Speaker 2>and so I really appreciate that.</v>

876
00:20:28.231 --> 00:20:28.501
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

877
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:29.334
<v Speaker 2>it was a crazy,</v>

878
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.120
<v Speaker 2>well you,</v>

879
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:30.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

880
00:20:30.681 --> 00:20:30.920
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

881
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.760
<v Speaker 2>you were known for being a standup comic and then all of a sudden you hear,</v>

882
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.091
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

883
00:20:36.091 --> 00:20:40.650
<v Speaker 2>FX is doing a show with Kamau bell and it's being produced by Chris Rock.</v>

884
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:40.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

885
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.480
<v Speaker 2>So whenever you say Chris Rock,</v>

886
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:46.250
<v Speaker 2>we all get excited when the greatest comedians of all time it's producing this</v>

887
00:20:46.251 --> 00:20:46.561
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

888
00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 2>There's fucking show gotta be fantastic.</v>

889
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

890
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

891
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.100
<v Speaker 1>what you did it,</v>

892
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was really unique is you tackled some pretty interesting subjects</v>

893
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.560
<v Speaker 1>and some things that you never see discuss like rape jokes.</v>

894
00:20:56.561 --> 00:20:58.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean you had that thing with Lindy West,</v>

895
00:20:58.421 --> 00:20:58.910
<v Speaker 1>is that her name?</v>

896
00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and Jim Norton's that his name?</v>

897
00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

898
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

899
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I used to want to fuck her name.</v>

900
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate you,</v>

901
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:10.750
<v Speaker 1>you guys got into some complex subject matter for television,</v>

902
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.160
<v Speaker 1>which is late night television,</v>

903
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.313
<v Speaker 1>which is just,</v>

904
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean usually it's like my new song is all about love and I never,</v>

905
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I never wanted a late night talk show.</v>

906
00:21:18.821 --> 00:21:19.810
<v Speaker 1>It just ended up being,</v>

907
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:21.340
<v Speaker 1>that was the format that they called it.</v>

908
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Like I just wanted to show and they said it comes on after 11 I'm like,</v>

909
00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.110
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

910
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.943
<v Speaker 1>come on at eight.</v>

911
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:32.470
<v Speaker 1>But there's the thing if there's a person who's standing on a stage talking to</v>

912
00:21:32.471 --> 00:21:36.370
<v Speaker 1>an audience about the world and it's a late night talk show and I was always</v>

913
00:21:36.371 --> 00:21:39.880
<v Speaker 1>sort of rebelling against that format and trying to make it just a show that I</v>

914
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:40.714
<v Speaker 1>would want to watch.</v>

915
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Well I think you did a good job at doing that.</v>

916
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.220
<v Speaker 1>When when a show is on a network there's always going to be like a bunch of</v>

917
00:21:48.221 --> 00:21:51.760
<v Speaker 1>people that are also trying to change the direction of it.</v>

918
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Like you got your ideas and then you got your producers ideas,</v>

919
00:21:55.571 --> 00:21:59.230
<v Speaker 1>which ad hopefully to your ideas and the director's ideas which added and then</v>

920
00:21:59.231 --> 00:22:01.470
<v Speaker 1>you've got an executive and hey man,</v>

921
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.520
<v Speaker 1>you had a lot of fucking kick cooks in the kitchen.</v>

922
00:22:03.521 --> 00:22:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes you absolutely do.</v>

923
00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.440
<v Speaker 1>And that co coming from the world of stand up and also the world zoom.</v>

924
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.160
<v Speaker 1>I like the solo show that got me the thing.</v>

925
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.890
<v Speaker 1>I add friends helping me and I had people help me.</v>

926
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:12.701
<v Speaker 1>But it was ultimately,</v>

927
00:22:12.701 --> 00:22:13.030
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

928
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.670
<v Speaker 1>my words were the thing that we're coming out of my mouth and my idea,</v>

929
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.080
<v Speaker 1>nobody people could say,</v>

930
00:22:17.081 --> 00:22:17.450
<v Speaker 1>what should,</v>

931
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:18.011
<v Speaker 1>you should do this.</v>

932
00:22:18.011 --> 00:22:18.341
<v Speaker 1>And I'd be like,</v>

933
00:22:18.341 --> 00:22:18.481
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

934
00:22:18.481 --> 00:22:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I'll think about it.</v>

935
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.133
<v Speaker 1>But when you're in that,</v>

936
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.150
<v Speaker 1>that meat grinder environment,</v>

937
00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:23.380
<v Speaker 1>especially when it became daily,</v>

938
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.770
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people who are sort of yelling things at you and at some point</v>

939
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.101
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

940
00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:27.700
<v Speaker 1>for lack of,</v>

941
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.180
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

942
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.380
<v Speaker 1>If you can't top their idea,</v>

943
00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:30.160
<v Speaker 1>you sort of go,</v>

944
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:30.993
<v Speaker 1>I guess we'll do that.</v>

945
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.780
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

946
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

947
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.880
<v Speaker 1>or if somebody goes like,</v>

948
00:22:33.881 --> 00:22:34.411
<v Speaker 1>I just told her,</v>

949
00:22:34.411 --> 00:22:34.931
<v Speaker 1>I said this yesterday,</v>

950
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:35.764
<v Speaker 1>like somebody will be like,</v>

951
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:36.041
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

952
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:37.660
<v Speaker 1>you know what I was thinking we could do a cold open.</v>

953
00:22:37.661 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't really want to do a cold open cause that's just not the kind of</v>

954
00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:40.300
<v Speaker 1>show I want.</v>

955
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Well I think we have,</v>

956
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.070
<v Speaker 1>we have a big guest on,</v>

957
00:22:42.071 --> 00:22:42.821
<v Speaker 1>we'll do the cold open.</v>

958
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't really want to do that.</v>

959
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Well I asked the guests he wants to do it.</v>

960
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:46.301
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

961
00:22:46.301 --> 00:22:47.134
<v Speaker 1>I guess we'll do it.</v>

962
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.780
<v Speaker 1>And then the guest shows up and go,</v>

963
00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:49.410
<v Speaker 1>we're doing this call though.</v>

964
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:49.601
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

965
00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:50.171
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>

966
00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:50.530
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>

967
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:50.681
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

968
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:53.980
<v Speaker 1>but we already bought the whip cream and then suddenly have this vision of like,</v>

969
00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.660
<v Speaker 1>why are we doing this?</v>

970
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Why we bought it?</v>

971
00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Just there's this machine of television and this machine that suddenly are just</v>

972
00:23:03.151 --> 00:23:04.090
<v Speaker 1>as you either.</v>

973
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.373
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I was,</v>

974
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.170
<v Speaker 1>it was like a meat grinder and either I was putting the meat in the grinder or I</v>

975
00:23:08.171 --> 00:23:09.370
<v Speaker 1>was the meat for the grinder.</v>

976
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.630
<v Speaker 1>And in that format,</v>

977
00:23:10.631 --> 00:23:11.291
<v Speaker 1>when it was daily,</v>

978
00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:12.520
<v Speaker 1>a lot of days I was the meat.</v>

979
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it gets to a point where you're like a John Stewart type dude where</v>

980
00:23:16.151 --> 00:23:16.660
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

981
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.640
<v Speaker 1>you get to decide what goes in the grinder.</v>

982
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:18.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

983
00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:19.990
<v Speaker 1>And I think that Stuart,</v>

984
00:23:19.991 --> 00:23:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I've read lots of stuff on him.</v>

985
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:21.490
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

986
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.050
<v Speaker 1>it took him two and a half years to get the daily show.</v>

987
00:23:23.051 --> 00:23:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't all,</v>

988
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:24.790
<v Speaker 1>we think of the daily show,</v>

989
00:23:24.791 --> 00:23:27.440
<v Speaker 1>we're really thinking about 10 the last 10 years of the daily show me,</v>

990
00:23:27.441 --> 00:23:28.570
<v Speaker 1>we're not thinking about that first.</v>

991
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:31.960
<v Speaker 1>When he first got there and took over from Craig Kilborn and it was sort of a</v>

992
00:23:31.961 --> 00:23:32.794
<v Speaker 1>wacky,</v>

993
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:33.101
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

994
00:23:33.101 --> 00:23:35.710
<v Speaker 1>afternoon parody show of like news event show,</v>

995
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:35.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

996
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.080
<v Speaker 1>so it was more of like a pop culture type thing.</v>

997
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:38.291
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

998
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:38.830
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

999
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.180
<v Speaker 1>it was like a parody of those.</v>

1000
00:23:40.181 --> 00:23:41.070
<v Speaker 1>They don't really do these anymore,</v>

1001
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.420
<v Speaker 1>but those afternoons shows that you see like you know,</v>

1002
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.100
<v Speaker 1>evening magazine,</v>

1003
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.063
<v Speaker 1>those things</v>

1004
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 1>where it's like we went to the floor show and found this new floors to Bubba and</v>

1005
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:53.720
<v Speaker 1>John took it a more political direction,</v>

1006
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.793
<v Speaker 1>but he had the,</v>

1007
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:56.720
<v Speaker 1>from everything I've read comedy central didn't want it,</v>

1008
00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.710
<v Speaker 1>but he was in a position where he wasn't being told he was the face of the</v>

1009
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:03.680
<v Speaker 1>network and that all the pressure was on him because they were,</v>

1010
00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:05.090
<v Speaker 1>he had south park and he had all the,</v>

1011
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.720
<v Speaker 1>all the other stuff on comedy central wears on effects on Fx FX.</v>

1012
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:09.800
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1013
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.660
<v Speaker 1>they had one night of original programming that wasn't,</v>

1014
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:15.470
<v Speaker 1>that included me when it was like the league or it's always sunny or Jim</v>

1015
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Jefferies every other night.</v>

1016
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.210
<v Speaker 1>It would be like you'd be somebody be at home watching a mad about you rerun and</v>

1017
00:24:20.211 --> 00:24:22.730
<v Speaker 1>enjoying it and then suddenly a blackout would come on screaming about the</v>

1018
00:24:22.731 --> 00:24:23.720
<v Speaker 1>events of the day and I get,</v>

1019
00:24:23.721 --> 00:24:24.051
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

1020
00:24:24.051 --> 00:24:24.551
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1021
00:24:24.551 --> 00:24:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1022
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:25.703
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1023
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:26.391
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1024
00:24:26.391 --> 00:24:26.601
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1025
00:24:26.601 --> 00:24:26.960
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1026
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I was enjoying Paul Riser from the 90s of black guy,</v>

1027
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.770
<v Speaker 1>a black guy.</v>

1028
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.310
<v Speaker 1>He just said that like in a way this that.</v>

1029
00:24:34.311 --> 00:24:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Is that something you are acutely aware of?</v>

1030
00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Like how they were programming it like,</v>

1031
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.310
<v Speaker 1>because I'm aware of the audience.</v>

1032
00:24:40.311 --> 00:24:42.200
<v Speaker 1>If you're watching a mad about you rerun,</v>

1033
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.390
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not in any way insulting mad about you,</v>

1034
00:24:44.391 --> 00:24:45.220
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying if you're like,</v>

1035
00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.053
<v Speaker 1>oh and salt,</v>

1036
00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:46.670
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

1037
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Just don't shit's bad for America.</v>

1038
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Good for Paul Rogers Bay.</v>

1039
00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:52.070
<v Speaker 1>I just don't have any opinion.</v>

1040
00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:52.481
<v Speaker 1>It's at,</v>

1041
00:24:52.481 --> 00:24:53.314
<v Speaker 1>that's your thing.</v>

1042
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.990
<v Speaker 1>If you're watching a rerun of some sitcoms from the 90s and you're enjoying it,</v>

1043
00:24:56.991 --> 00:24:57.920
<v Speaker 1>which you can,</v>

1044
00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:02.420
<v Speaker 1>and then suddenly I come on screen and I'm the op on basically the opposite of</v>

1045
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:02.631
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1046
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm a guy who's talking about right now and not talking about what happened in</v>

1047
00:25:04.981 --> 00:25:08.210
<v Speaker 1>the 90s and I'm a black guy and you're just watching a bunch of white people on</v>

1048
00:25:08.211 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 1>the upper west side of Manhattan and talk about,</v>

1049
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:10.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1050
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.581
<v Speaker 1>we go,</v>

1051
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:12.980
<v Speaker 1>how are we going to get to the coffee shop if we don't bump it up?</v>

1052
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:13.881
<v Speaker 1>And then I come on,</v>

1053
00:25:13.881 --> 00:25:15.200
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about homophobia.</v>

1054
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:15.561
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1055
00:25:15.561 --> 00:25:17.130
<v Speaker 1>like I get this is,</v>

1056
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard transition.</v>

1057
00:25:18.531 --> 00:25:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if there's a network that's programmed where I'm a part of the package,</v>

1058
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.020
<v Speaker 1>then it segues and things.</v>

1059
00:25:24.021 --> 00:25:25.450
<v Speaker 1>We'll segue one into the other one.</v>

1060
00:25:25.451 --> 00:25:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1061
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Not only it guy that's,</v>

1062
00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:27.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1063
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.860
<v Speaker 1>polar opposite of the nineties during the current guy,</v>

1064
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.990
<v Speaker 1>but a progressive black cock intelligent who's knocking about some controversial</v>

1065
00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.600
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard to like,</v>

1066
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:38.630
<v Speaker 1>it becomes hard to box.</v>

1067
00:25:38.631 --> 00:25:39.464
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I'm doing,</v>

1068
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.591
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1069
00:25:39.591 --> 00:25:42.060
<v Speaker 1>this is what I expect black guys to do it.</v>

1070
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.550
<v Speaker 1>And I'm doing things where,</v>

1071
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:44.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
00:25:44.121 --> 00:25:46.400
<v Speaker 1>where I'm being vulnerable are also talking about issues that I don't know</v>

1073
00:25:46.401 --> 00:25:47.720
<v Speaker 1>anything about and I'm trying to learn about them.</v>

1074
00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1075
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:48.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1076
00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.670
<v Speaker 1>That's huge.</v>

1077
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:50.331
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>

1078
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:51.980
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was an interesting approach,</v>

1079
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:52.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1080
00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.640
<v Speaker 1>of your show that you don't really see too much when it comes to controversial</v>

1081
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:55.940
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

1082
00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Like a guy who had set her pretending to be the expert in everything and you</v>

1083
00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:00.020
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1084
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.040
<v Speaker 1>the voice of reason,</v>

1085
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.360
<v Speaker 1>you kind of like laid back and ask questions and try to piece it together on the</v>

1086
00:26:05.361 --> 00:26:05.870
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>

1087
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:06.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what that was like.</v>

1088
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.350
<v Speaker 1>The man on the street stuff we did was always this stuff people responded to the</v>

1089
00:26:09.351 --> 00:26:10.430
<v Speaker 1>best of in addition to the,</v>

1090
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.720
<v Speaker 1>at the debates we did,</v>

1091
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:12.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1092
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:16.190
<v Speaker 1>put like when I would go and treat and talk to people and we would make comedy</v>

1093
00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:17.330
<v Speaker 1>out of what we were talking about,</v>

1094
00:26:17.331 --> 00:26:18.410
<v Speaker 1>whether we agreed or not,</v>

1095
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.800
<v Speaker 1>just out of like me talking to them about whatever the issues were and that</v>

1096
00:26:21.801 --> 00:26:22.634
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1097
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.540
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like my comedy that we would have doesn't work if I pretend to be</v>

1098
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:27.500
<v Speaker 1>the smartest guy in the room.</v>

1099
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Like people say I'm smart,</v>

1100
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:32.150
<v Speaker 1>which sometimes when people say that they feel like you're smart and they sort</v>

1101
00:26:32.151 --> 00:26:34.670
<v Speaker 1>of shake your head like I didn't expect that.</v>

1102
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Or also like industry,</v>

1103
00:26:35.871 --> 00:26:37.040
<v Speaker 1>like we don't know what to do with that.</v>

1104
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1105
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.653
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1106
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.900
<v Speaker 1>so I will take that and I certainly like to read no stuff like you do,</v>

1107
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not the smartest of my friends.</v>

1108
00:26:44.221 --> 00:26:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm the funny one of my friends,</v>

1109
00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:46.321
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1110
00:26:46.321 --> 00:26:47.101
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one who they're like,</v>

1111
00:26:47.101 --> 00:26:47.311
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1112
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:47.640
<v Speaker 1>come out.</v>

1113
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.780
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what you're talking about.</v>

1114
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:48.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1115
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:49.171
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1116
00:26:49.171 --> 00:26:49.771
<v Speaker 1>read this.</v>

1117
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:53.120
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the place that it works best for me not to go on,</v>

1118
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.090
<v Speaker 1>stay on TV and be like,</v>

1119
00:26:54.091 --> 00:26:54.780
<v Speaker 1>let me explain.</v>

1120
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Unless I'm talking about something about being black in America,</v>

1121
00:26:57.451 --> 00:26:59.100
<v Speaker 1>then I feel like I've got some research I've done.</v>

1122
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I've done quite a bit of comic or gay and that you're an expert in.</v>

1123
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1124
00:27:03.181 --> 00:27:03.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1125
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:05.670
<v Speaker 1>There's areas where I feel like I will hold my opinion,</v>

1126
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:06.331
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1127
00:27:06.331 --> 00:27:06.961
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of stuff,</v>

1128
00:27:06.961 --> 00:27:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm just as I'm trying to see,</v>

1129
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.870
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to know everything all the time.</v>

1130
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.830
<v Speaker 1>When I've watched your show,</v>

1131
00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I thought besides that,</v>

1132
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.190
<v Speaker 1>this is a really good show and really unique,</v>

1133
00:27:14.191 --> 00:27:15.420
<v Speaker 1>is that you should be on the Internet.</v>

1134
00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:16.231
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1135
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:19.080
<v Speaker 1>why does it need just do this fucking show on the Internet when he beat himself?</v>

1136
00:27:19.081 --> 00:27:20.340
<v Speaker 1>100% yeah,</v>

1137
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:24.690
<v Speaker 1>because you can get the numbers on the Internet that are just as big as any</v>

1138
00:27:24.691 --> 00:27:24.901
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>

1139
00:27:24.901 --> 00:27:26.760
<v Speaker 1>You got an FX xxx.</v>

1140
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the numbers we got.</v>

1141
00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:29.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called historically low.</v>

1142
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.720
<v Speaker 1>I think I can do that on,</v>

1143
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:33.773
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet.</v>

1144
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.100
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like there's a,</v>

1145
00:27:35.101 --> 00:27:35.481
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1146
00:27:35.481 --> 00:27:36.840
<v Speaker 1>you developed a following.</v>

1147
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:38.850
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of um,</v>

1148
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.590
<v Speaker 1>really a lot of positive reactions to what you were doing and it seems like you</v>

1149
00:27:43.591 --> 00:27:46.680
<v Speaker 1>can carry that onto the internet smoothly and it would just take off like</v>

1150
00:27:46.681 --> 00:27:47.514
<v Speaker 1>wildfire.</v>

1151
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Right now I was,</v>

1152
00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.850
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of things that happened when the show got canceled.</v>

1153
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Like we were cause so me and my wife,</v>

1154
00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.020
<v Speaker 1>my daughter moved to New York for the shoot.</v>

1155
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.580
<v Speaker 1>We'd never lived in New York,</v>

1156
00:27:56.581 --> 00:27:57.301
<v Speaker 1>never thought of it like New York.</v>

1157
00:27:57.301 --> 00:27:58.410
<v Speaker 1>My wife was born and raised in Monterey,</v>

1158
00:27:58.411 --> 00:27:59.090
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

1159
00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't want to be out of northern California.</v>

1160
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.160
<v Speaker 1>So we moved in,</v>

1161
00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:02.611
<v Speaker 1>I lived there.</v>

1162
00:28:02.611 --> 00:28:03.390
<v Speaker 1>So we moved to this.</v>

1163
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.620
<v Speaker 1>So going to show that canceled.</v>

1164
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.510
<v Speaker 1>And then there was this period of like,</v>

1165
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:07.201
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who do you call it?</v>

1166
00:28:07.201 --> 00:28:08.034
<v Speaker 1>Crippling depression.</v>

1167
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.033
<v Speaker 1>Like we're just like,</v>

1168
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.990
<v Speaker 1>what happens next?</v>

1169
00:28:09.991 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 1>What do I do it right?</v>

1170
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Do we stay here?</v>

1171
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:12.571
<v Speaker 1>Do we leave?</v>

1172
00:28:12.571 --> 00:28:13.590
<v Speaker 1>And then my wife got pregnant,</v>

1173
00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:15.280
<v Speaker 1>she's pregnant with her second kid graduations.</v>

1174
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.871
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1176
00:28:15.871 --> 00:28:16.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1177
00:28:16.141 --> 00:28:17.730
<v Speaker 1>And so it was this thing about like,</v>

1178
00:28:17.731 --> 00:28:17.851
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1179
00:28:17.851 --> 00:28:18.061
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1180
00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:18.840
<v Speaker 1>now what do we do?</v>

1181
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Are we going to raise a kid?</v>

1182
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.251
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1183
00:28:20.251 --> 00:28:21.360
<v Speaker 1>are we gonna have a baby in New York?</v>

1184
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And they just sounded like a reality show.</v>

1185
00:28:22.831 --> 00:28:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to watch like,</v>

1186
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:24.654
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1187
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.580
<v Speaker 1>these couple have a baby.</v>

1188
00:28:26.581 --> 00:28:26.971
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1189
00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:27.511
<v Speaker 1>we can't,</v>

1190
00:28:27.511 --> 00:28:28.344
<v Speaker 1>not in Manhattan.</v>

1191
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:33.390
<v Speaker 1>And so we just moved back to the bay like six weeks ago and everything in my</v>

1192
00:28:33.391 --> 00:28:34.224
<v Speaker 1>life has been like,</v>

1193
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.280
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1194
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Like I just feel like I can breathe again and more about San Francisco than New</v>

1195
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:39.840
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

1196
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1197
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I think New York is New York is the greatest city in the world.</v>

1198
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:43.681
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to,</v>

1199
00:28:43.681 --> 00:28:44.221
<v Speaker 1>I think it is,</v>

1200
00:28:44.221 --> 00:28:48.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a hard city to live in if I feel like if you're from there born</v>

1201
00:28:48.091 --> 00:28:48.511
<v Speaker 1>and raised,</v>

1202
00:28:48.511 --> 00:28:49.344
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>

1203
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Or if you move there and have the means to have the means to live the life you</v>

1204
00:28:52.951 --> 00:28:55.480
<v Speaker 1>want or you're 22 you know like I feel like those,</v>

1205
00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.180
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not any of those things at this point.</v>

1206
00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.143
<v Speaker 1>If the bay,</v>

1207
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.240
<v Speaker 1>you get all the good stuff that New York has,</v>

1208
00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:01.440
<v Speaker 1>all the culture,</v>

1209
00:29:01.441 --> 00:29:02.101
<v Speaker 1>all the ideas,</v>

1210
00:29:02.101 --> 00:29:02.934
<v Speaker 1>all the diversity,</v>

1211
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:06.870
<v Speaker 1>but there's just a more is more wide open space and there's more,</v>

1212
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.640
<v Speaker 1>there's more conversation.</v>

1213
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.361
<v Speaker 1>There's more like,</v>

1214
00:29:09.361 --> 00:29:09.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1215
00:29:09.601 --> 00:29:09.961
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

1216
00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:11.550
<v Speaker 1>it feels like you can,</v>

1217
00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.490
<v Speaker 1>it's an area where people move there to be curious.</v>

1218
00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:15.121
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1219
00:29:15.121 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Like they moved there and be like,</v>

1220
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:16.320
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1221
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to see if I can turn my.com idea until,</v>

1222
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1223
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:20.181
<v Speaker 1>or people go to,</v>

1224
00:29:20.181 --> 00:29:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go there to be gay as I want to be.</v>

1225
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Find out if I can be too gay.</v>

1226
00:29:24.541 --> 00:29:25.111
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1227
00:29:25.111 --> 00:29:25.560
<v Speaker 1>To Go,</v>

1228
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.540
<v Speaker 1>this is a $4 million house.</v>

1229
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:27.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1230
00:29:27.841 --> 00:29:28.021
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1231
00:29:28.021 --> 00:29:28.854
<v Speaker 1>we live in Berkeley,</v>

1232
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.030
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1233
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:30.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1234
00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:30.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1235
00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:30.780
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1236
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.091
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1237
00:29:31.091 --> 00:29:31.591
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1238
00:29:31.591 --> 00:29:32.370
<v Speaker 1>I lived,</v>

1239
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I lived in San Francisco and moved back and my joke is that San Francisco was</v>

1240
00:29:35.431 --> 00:29:35.551
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1241
00:29:35.551 --> 00:29:36.450
<v Speaker 1>now you live in Berkeley.</v>

1242
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:37.343
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1243
00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:38.240
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

1244
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1245
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.001
<v Speaker 1>we can't,</v>

1246
00:29:39.001 --> 00:29:40.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't live in San Francisco anymore.</v>

1247
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can know it's the city is only seven by seven people don't realize that</v>

1248
00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:44.794
<v Speaker 1>it's tiny.</v>

1249
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1250
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.660
<v Speaker 1>And at some point I think Gavin Newsome,</v>

1251
00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:47.221
<v Speaker 1>the mayor realized,</v>

1252
00:29:47.221 --> 00:29:47.381
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1253
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:49.240
<v Speaker 1>this could all be high end real estate.</v>

1254
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.250
<v Speaker 1>The entire city could behind real estate.</v>

1255
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what it is now.</v>

1256
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1257
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:56.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's become a thing where unless you've lived there for 40 years and own your</v>

1258
00:29:56.111 --> 00:29:56.800
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>

1259
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.350
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

1260
00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:00.040
<v Speaker 1>people are being kicked out of like old people are being kicked out of</v>

1261
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.521
<v Speaker 1>apartments.</v>

1262
00:30:00.521 --> 00:30:04.990
<v Speaker 1>They've lived in for their entire lives because landlords are turning their</v>

1263
00:30:04.991 --> 00:30:07.210
<v Speaker 1>buildings into condos and it's really a big deal there.</v>

1264
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I lived in San Francisco during the Vietnam War.</v>

1265
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I lived in San Francisco when I was a little kid.</v>

1266
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.830
<v Speaker 1>When you said that was totally like you were in the Vietnam War.</v>

1267
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:16.290
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1268
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:19.810
<v Speaker 1>that's so funny way that I lived there in [inaudible] 72 I lived there during</v>

1269
00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:20.591
<v Speaker 1>the Vietnam War.</v>

1270
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:23.680
<v Speaker 1>I was an objector conscious as objective as a four year old.</v>

1271
00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:24.540
<v Speaker 1>I was seven.</v>

1272
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1273
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:25.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1274
00:30:25.321 --> 00:30:26.154
<v Speaker 1>I knew better,</v>

1275
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:27.820
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1276
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.850
<v Speaker 1>it shaped the way I look at the world very,</v>

1277
00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:31.361
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1278
00:30:31.361 --> 00:30:31.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1279
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.290
<v Speaker 1>very much so.</v>

1280
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:32.741
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

1281
00:30:32.741 --> 00:30:35.140
<v Speaker 1>it's too open sometimes I think people like it.</v>

1282
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.260
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco gets so liberally,</v>

1283
00:30:36.261 --> 00:30:37.091
<v Speaker 1>gets conservative,</v>

1284
00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:40.240
<v Speaker 1>like were there like where they get very tunnel vision in their liberalness.</v>

1285
00:30:40.241 --> 00:30:40.760
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1286
00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:41.860
<v Speaker 1>but I think for me that's,</v>

1287
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I've learned to understand that and I looked and that's a part of why I think my</v>

1288
00:30:44.681 --> 00:30:45.431
<v Speaker 1>act of uptodate is,</v>

1289
00:30:45.431 --> 00:30:46.450
<v Speaker 1>I've learned to fuck with that.</v>

1290
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:47.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1291
00:30:47.171 --> 00:30:47.650
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>

1292
00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:48.461
<v Speaker 1>it's not perfect,</v>

1293
00:30:48.461 --> 00:30:49.294
<v Speaker 1>but it just,</v>

1294
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 1>it just feels like you can breathe out there and you still get all this stuff.</v>

1295
00:30:51.851 --> 00:30:52.331
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't,</v>

1296
00:30:52.331 --> 00:30:55.750
<v Speaker 1>you're not missing any of the concerts or any of the movies or any of the food</v>

1297
00:30:55.751 --> 00:30:56.584
<v Speaker 1>of New York,</v>

1298
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.790
<v Speaker 1>but you get to like,</v>

1299
00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:58.990
<v Speaker 1>you get to a,</v>

1300
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.940
<v Speaker 1>everything's not 400 feet tall.</v>

1301
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.170
<v Speaker 1>That is an interesting thing though,</v>

1302
00:31:02.171 --> 00:31:02.531
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1303
00:31:02.531 --> 00:31:07.480
<v Speaker 1>How like you can get so liberal that it almost becomes conservative cause become</v>

1304
00:31:07.481 --> 00:31:11.140
<v Speaker 1>so dogmatic and your idea because liberals get very focused on their version of</v>

1305
00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:13.260
<v Speaker 1>liberalism and so aggressive about it.</v>

1306
00:31:13.261 --> 00:31:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1307
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1308
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1309
00:31:14.171 --> 00:31:14.371
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1310
00:31:14.371 --> 00:31:14.650
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1311
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a big thing about it is it's not about kindness and love and</v>

1312
00:31:18.491 --> 00:31:19.690
<v Speaker 1>understanding so much.</v>

1313
00:31:19.691 --> 00:31:22.240
<v Speaker 1>It's about pushing their idea with kindness,</v>

1314
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:23.770
<v Speaker 1>love and understanding should be,</v>

1315
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:24.490
<v Speaker 1>and you disagree.</v>

1316
00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:26.110
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking mail pig.</v>

1317
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Patriarchal privilege.</v>

1318
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.370
<v Speaker 1>He's a shit die in a fire.</v>

1319
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:31.571
<v Speaker 1>He gets,</v>

1320
00:31:31.571 --> 00:31:32.830
<v Speaker 1>it gets pretty aggressive.</v>

1321
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I agree with the white privilege part,</v>

1322
00:31:34.031 --> 00:31:34.864
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1323
00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:35.920
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1324
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.753
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

1325
00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.010
<v Speaker 1>people don't realize and that's what the show was trying to do,</v>

1326
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:40.480
<v Speaker 1>that people get caught up in.</v>

1327
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a,</v>

1328
00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.513
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1329
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:43.121
<v Speaker 1>my friends,</v>

1330
00:31:43.121 --> 00:31:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I've Milton black friends who are like,</v>

1331
00:31:44.351 --> 00:31:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Milton black has the thing and they sort of ignore like the,</v>

1332
00:31:47.921 --> 00:31:51.730
<v Speaker 1>like the gay rights side of it and suddenly somebody starts talking about gay</v>

1333
00:31:51.731 --> 00:31:51.910
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

1334
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:52.151
<v Speaker 1>Like no,</v>

1335
00:31:52.151 --> 00:31:52.960
<v Speaker 1>that's not important.</v>

1336
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.830
<v Speaker 1>It's militancy,</v>

1337
00:31:53.831 --> 00:31:54.700
<v Speaker 1>black militancy.</v>

1338
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:55.930
<v Speaker 1>And then there's gay people were like,</v>

1339
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.311
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1340
00:31:56.311 --> 00:31:56.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1341
00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:56.561
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1342
00:31:56.561 --> 00:31:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Immigration is not important.</v>

1343
00:31:57.671 --> 00:31:58.520
<v Speaker 1>It's about getting,</v>

1344
00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.180
<v Speaker 1>so people get caught in their lane and his show and my life is about,</v>

1345
00:32:02.181 --> 00:32:02.560
<v Speaker 1>and how we,</v>

1346
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.130
<v Speaker 1>all of us on the right side of the issues need to get in the same hot tub</v>

1347
00:32:06.131 --> 00:32:07.210
<v Speaker 1>together and figure it out.</v>

1348
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:07.511
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1349
00:32:07.511 --> 00:32:11.140
<v Speaker 1>like we need to sort of talk that we're all on the right side of me up until hot</v>

1350
00:32:11.141 --> 00:32:11.974
<v Speaker 1>tub.</v>

1351
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.900
<v Speaker 1>That could be a problem.</v>

1352
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.330
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to talk to what gay dudes,</v>

1353
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:21.410
<v Speaker 1>what militants or in that you can't have a fucking bra and a hot tub who has a</v>

1354
00:32:21.411 --> 00:32:22.360
<v Speaker 1>brawl in a hot thing.</v>

1355
00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.380
<v Speaker 1>It can happen in a hot tub.</v>

1356
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.340
<v Speaker 1>I never saw a fucking guy knocked the girl out in the elevator before the ray</v>

1357
00:32:27.341 --> 00:32:27.911
<v Speaker 1>rice video,</v>

1358
00:32:27.911 --> 00:32:29.080
<v Speaker 1>but apparently it's positive.</v>

1359
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's lots of footage you guys get to know people getting knocked out</v>

1360
00:32:31.671 --> 00:32:32.261
<v Speaker 1>in elevators.</v>

1361
00:32:32.261 --> 00:32:35.860
<v Speaker 1>But I think brought somebody Google hot to abroad and see what comes up.</v>

1362
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.110
<v Speaker 1>This is a very famous story about a guy,</v>

1363
00:32:38.111 --> 00:32:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you heard this one a few years ago.</v>

1364
00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:43.510
<v Speaker 1>He was a newscaster and um,</v>

1365
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.890
<v Speaker 1>he was a gay guy that was in the closet.</v>

1366
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.160
<v Speaker 1>He's in like Oklahoma TV or some shit like that and uh,</v>

1367
00:32:49.161 --> 00:32:49.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1368
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:50.120
<v Speaker 1>one of those.</v>

1369
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Bob.</v>

1370
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1371
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.760
<v Speaker 1>today's top story.</v>

1372
00:32:52.761 --> 00:32:52.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1373
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.320
<v Speaker 1>one of those fucking weird guys.</v>

1374
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.560
<v Speaker 1>He woke up with a dead guy next to him.</v>

1375
00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.940
<v Speaker 1>They had been doing crystal meth all night and,</v>

1376
00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.970
<v Speaker 1>and having gay sex and uh,</v>

1377
00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:06.440
<v Speaker 1>the guy had a belt around his neck and the guy is fixated while doing auto</v>

1378
00:33:06.441 --> 00:33:08.840
<v Speaker 1>erotic fixation and he passed out.</v>

1379
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:11.030
<v Speaker 1>They passed out together in this hot tub.</v>

1380
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.370
<v Speaker 1>So he woke up in the hot tub,</v>

1381
00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:19.040
<v Speaker 1>mapped out doing pills with a blue guy next to him with a belt around his neck.</v>

1382
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:21.351
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

1383
00:33:21.351 --> 00:33:22.530
<v Speaker 1>not a fight and not slide,</v>

1384
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:23.900
<v Speaker 1>allegedly were all,</v>

1385
00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:25.240
<v Speaker 1>they were all in it together.</v>

1386
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Skiing,</v>

1387
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.110
<v Speaker 1>hot tub brawl leads to arrest,</v>

1388
00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.930
<v Speaker 1>but that's Michigan man.</v>

1389
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Those are crazy white people.</v>

1390
00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:33.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a different kind of human being.</v>

1391
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I love that you googled out to have Raul and found something that</v>

1392
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I said that because I wanted to see and I knew that I knew it was coming.</v>

1393
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:43.731
<v Speaker 1>Of course it is,</v>

1394
00:33:43.731 --> 00:33:44.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably us.</v>

1395
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.730
<v Speaker 1>That style of fighting styles.</v>

1396
00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.390
<v Speaker 1>It will be the next UFC hot tub.</v>

1397
00:33:49.391 --> 00:33:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Rollen yeah,</v>

1398
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:53.000
<v Speaker 1>people use techniques you've got to push off the back of the time.</v>

1399
00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.610
<v Speaker 1>It's very important to get the Ph balance of the water.</v>

1400
00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.540
<v Speaker 1>It makes a big difference.</v>

1401
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Don't get it in your mouth.</v>

1402
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.430
<v Speaker 1>It'll affect your breathing.</v>

1403
00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:03.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot going on with hot tub brawling and hot to bro,</v>

1404
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.311
<v Speaker 1>but it's funny,</v>

1405
00:34:04.311 --> 00:34:04.911
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite,</v>

1406
00:34:04.911 --> 00:34:05.650
<v Speaker 1>just to remind me,</v>

1407
00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:09.140
<v Speaker 1>this is like one of my favorite things about San Francisco and just favorite</v>

1408
00:34:09.141 --> 00:34:10.190
<v Speaker 1>things I ever saw and so it was just cool.</v>

1409
00:34:10.191 --> 00:34:10.630
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1410
00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:13.910
<v Speaker 1>that's so gay community crystal method has been a problem in the gay community.</v>

1411
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.890
<v Speaker 1>It's an awesome thing.</v>

1412
00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Yet depends on dependents worked off.</v>

1413
00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.230
<v Speaker 1>When you take somebody out there,</v>

1414
00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:23.370
<v Speaker 1>is that really the Keith Richards version of it?</v>

1415
00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Like Crystal Meth is working for me.</v>

1416
00:34:24.891 --> 00:34:25.251
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1417
00:34:25.251 --> 00:34:26.084
<v Speaker 1>somebody up there.</v>

1418
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:27.560
<v Speaker 1>It can't be bad for everybody.</v>

1419
00:34:27.561 --> 00:34:29.090
<v Speaker 1>The otherwise I to stop selling it.</v>

1420
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Is that really how it works?</v>

1421
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Is that why Mcdonald's is open and some people are eating it and feeling it.</v>

1422
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:36.560
<v Speaker 1>I had a fucking egg muffin this morning.</v>

1423
00:34:36.561 --> 00:34:37.480
<v Speaker 1>It was delicious.</v>

1424
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Don't have one tonight.</v>

1425
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:41.300
<v Speaker 1>No Egg.</v>

1426
00:34:41.301 --> 00:34:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Mcmuffins unlike crystal meth do not require you to continue using them all day</v>

1427
00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:47.360
<v Speaker 1>to maintain a state of normalcy.</v>

1428
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1429
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I think we would like you to use them everyday.</v>

1430
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:53.240
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>

1431
00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.300
<v Speaker 1>but they stopped selling them after 10:30 AM that's just cause they understand</v>

1432
00:34:56.301 --> 00:34:56.800
<v Speaker 1>coming junkies.</v>

1433
00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.633
<v Speaker 1>They understand.</v>

1434
00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.041
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1435
00:34:58.041 --> 00:34:58.570
<v Speaker 1>You can't get the,</v>

1436
00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.140
<v Speaker 1>you can't get the egg mcmuffin or up to 10 30,</v>

1437
00:35:00.141 --> 00:35:02.690
<v Speaker 1>because we don't want to cause a problem in America.</v>

1438
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:05.960
<v Speaker 1>There was a billboard in San Francisco,</v>

1439
00:35:05.961 --> 00:35:07.330
<v Speaker 1>like on the bus shelter,</v>

1440
00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.350
<v Speaker 1>like in the gay neighborhood where I had to,</v>

1441
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I used to take the bus from there,</v>

1442
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:11.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1443
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.280
<v Speaker 1>cause I'd hang up and uh,</v>

1444
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:16.010
<v Speaker 1>there was a billboard and it was a guy like all it was was,</v>

1445
00:35:16.011 --> 00:35:16.371
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1446
00:35:16.371 --> 00:35:16.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1447
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.850
<v Speaker 1>it was a billboard said don't do crystal meth or something and the image of the</v>

1448
00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:21.410
<v Speaker 1>billboard was a guy,</v>

1449
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.273
<v Speaker 1>I'll just do it like,</v>

1450
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:22.810
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1451
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:23.210
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

1452
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.400
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're standing over his shoulder and he's doing this</v>

1453
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.930
<v Speaker 1>and it was implied that he's getting fucked in the ass and didn't know it</v>

1454
00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:31.010
<v Speaker 1>because he was on crystal meth.</v>

1455
00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Why he was the great,</v>

1456
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:33.410
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>

1457
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:33.980
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1458
00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.080
<v Speaker 1>like he's got this horrified look on his face cause it's from the priest and</v>

1459
00:35:37.081 --> 00:35:40.290
<v Speaker 1>he's got his shirt off and it's from the perspective of like awesome guys</v>

1460
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:41.161
<v Speaker 1>fucking him in the ass.</v>

1461
00:35:41.161 --> 00:35:44.380
<v Speaker 1>So he's waking off yet in the middle of like the crystal meth Hayes.</v>

1462
00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:49.420
<v Speaker 1>He was making poor choices and it was like a thing at the bus shelter right next</v>

1463
00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:51.594
<v Speaker 1>to the Safeway,</v>

1464
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.553
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

1465
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:53.640
<v Speaker 1>I love this city.</v>

1466
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I was like ridiculous ad though.</v>

1467
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean if he can greenlit,</v>

1468
00:35:57.391 --> 00:35:58.320
<v Speaker 1>they got my attention.</v>

1469
00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done crystal since or before.</v>

1470
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Thanks man.</v>

1471
00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Learn wacky ads like that sounds like a bad scene.</v>

1472
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.430
<v Speaker 1>I think San Francisco is like,</v>

1473
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.420
<v Speaker 1>if not the smartest one of the smartest towns in the world.</v>

1474
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it gets a lot of credit for that,</v>

1475
00:36:14.581 --> 00:36:14.821
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1476
00:36:14.821 --> 00:36:15.530
<v Speaker 1>and I think that it,</v>

1477
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:16.321
<v Speaker 1>it can be,</v>

1478
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:19.590
<v Speaker 1>but I also think that if you like the comedy crowds get attention for being</v>

1479
00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:20.220
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>

1480
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I think that can be true,</v>

1481
00:36:21.301 --> 00:36:22.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>

1482
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.420
<v Speaker 1>you can also walk into San Francisco Club and be like,</v>

1483
00:36:24.421 --> 00:36:25.620
<v Speaker 1>where did these people come from?</v>

1484
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.131
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1485
00:36:26.131 --> 00:36:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Like there's tourists,</v>

1486
00:36:27.211 --> 00:36:28.560
<v Speaker 1>but there's also just a lot of like,</v>

1487
00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1488
00:36:29.041 --> 00:36:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to try and bridge and tunnel.</v>

1489
00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:32.690
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of like people coming into San Francisco and there's awesome</v>

1490
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.120
<v Speaker 1>crowd.</v>

1491
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 1>The original San Francisco people who live there are just people like,</v>

1492
00:36:35.791 --> 00:36:36.500
<v Speaker 1>you will cry,</v>

1493
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.070
<v Speaker 1>you will go to neighborhoods in San Francisco or like,</v>

1494
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:38.371
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1495
00:36:38.371 --> 00:36:40.030
<v Speaker 1>these people don't know it's the gas city on earth.</v>

1496
00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:41.791
<v Speaker 1>Do the plumber.</v>

1497
00:36:41.791 --> 00:36:44.460
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know that this is like the most progressive city in the plant on the</v>

1498
00:36:44.461 --> 00:36:44.850
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

1499
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this,</v>

1500
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:47.850
<v Speaker 1>this whole w w what,</v>

1501
00:36:47.851 --> 00:36:48.361
<v Speaker 1>what'd you call it?</v>

1502
00:36:48.361 --> 00:36:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Gentrification.</v>

1503
00:36:49.201 --> 00:36:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they call it and I would call it then people buy up the real estate</v>

1504
00:36:52.411 --> 00:36:54.660
<v Speaker 1>and it's going through the roof where they create neighborhoods where</v>

1505
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.150
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods weren't before or should have been and they didn't want to make a</v>

1506
00:36:57.151 --> 00:36:57.870
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

1507
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:58.291
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

1508
00:36:58.291 --> 00:36:58.920
<v Speaker 1>what can you do?</v>

1509
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.090
<v Speaker 1>What can they do to stop that?</v>

1510
00:37:00.091 --> 00:37:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean almost nothing.</v>

1511
00:37:01.141 --> 00:37:01.951
<v Speaker 1>The amount of money,</v>

1512
00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:06.090
<v Speaker 1>the wealth that's in the concentrated wealth makes it,</v>

1513
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:07.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1514
00:37:07.261 --> 00:37:09.930
<v Speaker 1>unless we want to storm the streets and get all like Ukraine in there,</v>

1515
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:13.020
<v Speaker 1>the concentrated wealth makes it damn near impossible because the first,</v>

1516
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:13.831
<v Speaker 1>not the first way,</v>

1517
00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:16.110
<v Speaker 1>but when I moved to San Francisco in the 90s,</v>

1518
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.190
<v Speaker 1>there was the.com,</v>

1519
00:37:17.191 --> 00:37:18.270
<v Speaker 1>the first.com bubble.</v>

1520
00:37:18.271 --> 00:37:19.590
<v Speaker 1>And they tried to gentrify the mission.</v>

1521
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:22.310
<v Speaker 1>And back then what they were doing was trying to,</v>

1522
00:37:22.311 --> 00:37:24.900
<v Speaker 1>it was tearing down stuff and building new things and neighborhood flexed on</v>

1523
00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:27.480
<v Speaker 1>them and said in the mission that historically Latino neighborhood and the</v>

1524
00:37:27.481 --> 00:37:28.231
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood flex and said,</v>

1525
00:37:28.231 --> 00:37:28.411
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1526
00:37:28.411 --> 00:37:29.131
<v Speaker 1>you can't do this.</v>

1527
00:37:29.131 --> 00:37:29.881
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how he did it,</v>

1528
00:37:29.881 --> 00:37:30.714
<v Speaker 1>but they stopped them.</v>

1529
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.040
<v Speaker 1>But now the money is so much bigger and the bubble didn't burst and it's Google</v>

1530
00:37:35.041 --> 00:37:36.480
<v Speaker 1>money and Facebook money,</v>

1531
00:37:36.481 --> 00:37:38.070
<v Speaker 1>which is going to last for the end of time,</v>

1532
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1533
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:40.530
<v Speaker 1>time being 10 years from now.</v>

1534
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:41.483
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1535
00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:44.190
<v Speaker 1>but that the money so concentrated that,</v>

1536
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.250
<v Speaker 1>and they're now being sneaky about how they gentrified.</v>

1537
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.490
<v Speaker 1>They don't tear the buildings down.</v>

1538
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.260
<v Speaker 1>They make the buildings look like they're the same buildings.</v>

1539
00:37:49.261 --> 00:37:50.220
<v Speaker 1>They just redo the inside.</v>

1540
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:50.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1541
00:37:50.641 --> 00:37:51.720
<v Speaker 1>So it becomes invisible.</v>

1542
00:37:51.721 --> 00:37:52.554
<v Speaker 1>So you just go,</v>

1543
00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:55.020
<v Speaker 1>did you suddenly you don't know that they're being re gentrified,</v>

1544
00:37:55.021 --> 00:37:55.441
<v Speaker 1>but then you'd go,</v>

1545
00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:55.681
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1546
00:37:55.681 --> 00:37:56.161
<v Speaker 1>that's there.</v>

1547
00:37:56.161 --> 00:37:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Sure are a lot more wine bars around here than they used to be.</v>

1548
00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:59.880
<v Speaker 1>But they don't look like that from the outside.</v>

1549
00:37:59.881 --> 00:38:03.640
<v Speaker 1>They look and you go into them and they're just unbelievably renovated.</v>

1550
00:38:03.641 --> 00:38:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1551
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Well what the fuck did you guys do?</v>

1552
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:07.500
<v Speaker 1>They've kept the outsides and situate that.</v>

1553
00:38:07.501 --> 00:38:08.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't that it's,</v>

1554
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:09.091
<v Speaker 1>it's more invisible.</v>

1555
00:38:09.091 --> 00:38:09.391
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1556
00:38:09.391 --> 00:38:10.110
<v Speaker 1>the Google,</v>

1557
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:11.790
<v Speaker 1>like there's the Google bus in San Francisco,</v>

1558
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:16.110
<v Speaker 1>like all the Google lights used to live in like mountain view down by Palo Alto.</v>

1559
00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.470
<v Speaker 1>But then Google does this thing that's become very controversial.</v>

1560
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.920
<v Speaker 1>They have a free bus that will take you from certain San Francisco neighborhoods</v>

1561
00:38:22.921 --> 00:38:24.750
<v Speaker 1>straight to Google so that you,</v>

1562
00:38:24.751 --> 00:38:29.550
<v Speaker 1>so that the 25 year old people who work at Google can live in the cool hip city,</v>

1563
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.080
<v Speaker 1>but then get to work for free.</v>

1564
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:35.740
<v Speaker 1>But what that does is that every stop on the Google bus line,</v>

1565
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:38.830
<v Speaker 1>it changes the neighborhood cause people want to live next to the Google bus</v>

1566
00:38:38.831 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

1567
00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.160
<v Speaker 1>And so then suddenly neighborhoods that like it would have been a poor</v>

1568
00:38:42.161 --> 00:38:43.810
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood or a struggling neighborhood.</v>

1569
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:46.990
<v Speaker 1>People are buying the property there and renovating things and then pushing the</v>

1570
00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:47.920
<v Speaker 1>other people out of the neighborhood.</v>

1571
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.600
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense the Google bus,</v>

1572
00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:52.180
<v Speaker 1>which is good because it keeps cars off the highway,</v>

1573
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:52.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1574
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:55.660
<v Speaker 1>And it also helps Google out because people get on the bus and start working</v>

1575
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:56.141
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

1576
00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:57.070
<v Speaker 1>So when people go,</v>

1577
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.611
<v Speaker 1>it's great,</v>

1578
00:38:57.611 --> 00:38:58.480
<v Speaker 1>we have free Wifi.</v>

1579
00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:58.721
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1580
00:38:58.721 --> 00:38:59.560
<v Speaker 1>that's how you can work.</v>

1581
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.540
<v Speaker 1>So it takes cars off the road.</v>

1582
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:02.980
<v Speaker 1>It's extensively helps people.</v>

1583
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.230
<v Speaker 1>It keeps you from living in places they don't want to live,</v>

1584
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.630
<v Speaker 1>but it changes the neighborhood and kicks people out of the neighborhood.</v>

1585
00:39:07.631 --> 00:39:11.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a very super controversial thing that San Francisco is dealing with right</v>

1586
00:39:11.051 --> 00:39:11.350
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1587
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:14.920
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco's and wealth for people who don't know is in this weird,</v>

1588
00:39:14.921 --> 00:39:17.200
<v Speaker 1>stupid category that doesn't even make any sense.</v>

1589
00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I have some friends that live in Atherton and a,</v>

1590
00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.190
<v Speaker 1>they rent a house there,</v>

1591
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.100
<v Speaker 1>but the house is worth $15 million</v>

1592
00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's not worth 15 nine I know.</v>

1593
00:39:27.191 --> 00:39:28.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't just not,</v>

1594
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.080
<v Speaker 1>you don't walk in and go,</v>

1595
00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:30.940
<v Speaker 1>this is a $15 million house,</v>

1596
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.331
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1597
00:39:31.331 --> 00:39:32.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't even walk in and go,</v>

1598
00:39:32.531 --> 00:39:34.090
<v Speaker 1>this is a $1 million house.</v>

1599
00:39:34.091 --> 00:39:35.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just a house.</v>

1600
00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:36.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking normal.</v>

1601
00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:36.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1602
00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:36.731
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1603
00:39:36.731 --> 00:39:37.564
<v Speaker 1>it's worth,</v>

1604
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:38.830
<v Speaker 1>if I had a guest,</v>

1605
00:39:38.831 --> 00:39:41.230
<v Speaker 1>like if you put it in a decent neighborhood in,</v>

1606
00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1607
00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:43.500
<v Speaker 1>studio city.</v>

1608
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:43.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1609
00:39:43.641 --> 00:39:44.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a $2 million house.</v>

1610
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:45.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a very nice house,</v>

1611
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's 15 fucking million dollars.</v>

1612
00:39:47.861 --> 00:39:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1613
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.480
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1614
00:39:49.481 --> 00:39:50.520
<v Speaker 1>And I'm walking around,</v>

1615
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.801
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1616
00:39:50.801 --> 00:39:52.780
<v Speaker 1>how is this house worth $15 million?</v>

1617
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.160
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

1618
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a sauna.</v>

1619
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.530
<v Speaker 1>It's got a normal backyard.</v>

1620
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.450
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have a view of the fucking,</v>

1621
00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Speaker 1>the continental divide and they'll have a wiffle ball stadium.</v>

1622
00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:02.651
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

1623
00:40:02.651 --> 00:40:03.401
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1624
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:05.590
<v Speaker 1>The money there is so over the top,</v>

1625
00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.340
<v Speaker 1>the concentrated wealth artificially inflates the values of everything around</v>

1626
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:09.490
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1627
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.740
<v Speaker 1>which means people who've lived there forever suddenly being told,</v>

1628
00:40:11.741 --> 00:40:12.550
<v Speaker 1>you can't live here anymore.</v>

1629
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.383
<v Speaker 1>They can't afford it.</v>

1630
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.940
<v Speaker 1>It would have to look $15 million.</v>

1631
00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:16.211
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1632
00:40:16.211 --> 00:40:17.290
<v Speaker 1>what is the fucking mortgage on?</v>

1633
00:40:17.291 --> 00:40:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

1634
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1635
00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:18.581
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

1636
00:40:18.581 --> 00:40:18.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1637
00:40:18.731 --> 00:40:20.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like that was a month or so.</v>

1638
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Which way do you have to have to keep a $50 million house?</v>

1639
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:27.730
<v Speaker 1>The mortgage would be like probably close to $100,000 a month.</v>

1640
00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:28.481
<v Speaker 1>So that's a million,</v>

1641
00:40:28.481 --> 00:40:29.800
<v Speaker 1>$200,000 a fucking,</v>

1642
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.753
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1643
00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1644
00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:32.290
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1645
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:33.380
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1646
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.260
<v Speaker 1>You and you haven't,</v>

1647
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.550
<v Speaker 1>what if the sink Britain,</v>

1648
00:40:35.551 --> 00:40:35.741

00:40:36.191 --> 00:40:37.024
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:38.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1652
00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:38.621

1654
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:40.340
<v Speaker 1>the earth moves.</v>

1655
00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1656
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:41.883
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>

1657
00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:43.120
<v Speaker 1>All the insurance because you're in,</v>

1658
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you're all at your house is built on a fault line,</v>

1659
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:45.881
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1660
00:40:45.881 --> 00:40:46.450
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1661
00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:46.721
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1662
00:40:46.721 --> 00:40:47.890
<v Speaker 1>that is completely,</v>

1663
00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:48.560
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1664
00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:48.910
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1665
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:49.301
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1666
00:40:49.301 --> 00:40:49.811
<v Speaker 1>it sucks,</v>

1667
00:40:49.811 --> 00:40:50.381
<v Speaker 1>but there's no,</v>

1668
00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:50.770
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1669
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:51.790
<v Speaker 1>it's capitalism.</v>

1670
00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:52.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1671
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:52.781
<v Speaker 1>capitalism.</v>

1672
00:40:52.781 --> 00:40:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Unchecked is not necessarily the best thing,</v>

1673
00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:55.751
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1674
00:40:55.751 --> 00:40:58.840
<v Speaker 1>And what's the option now if you say capitalism unchecked,</v>

1675
00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:00.700
<v Speaker 1>it's capitalism sort of.</v>

1676
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:03.310
<v Speaker 1>We'll always capitalism.</v>

1677
00:41:03.311 --> 00:41:04.480
<v Speaker 1>I feel like unless you sorta go,</v>

1678
00:41:04.481 --> 00:41:04.661
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1679
00:41:04.661 --> 00:41:05.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should,</v>

1680
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:06.790
<v Speaker 1>you know this should,</v>

1681
00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.650
<v Speaker 1>we should keep an area for people who've lived here.</v>

1682
00:41:08.651 --> 00:41:11.530
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't allow people to get kicked out of their houses for old people</v>

1683
00:41:11.531 --> 00:41:13.600
<v Speaker 1>should never be kicked out of their house and they're paying the rent that they</v>

1684
00:41:13.601 --> 00:41:16.660
<v Speaker 1>were agreed to pay when they moved in in 80 a hundred years ago.</v>

1685
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.160
<v Speaker 1>That's the things that have to be,</v>

1686
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.950
<v Speaker 1>people should be allowed to buy whatever property they want to buy this for</v>

1687
00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:21.784
<v Speaker 1>sale.</v>

1688
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.640
<v Speaker 1>But it's also a thing where you shouldn't make it easier on those people and</v>

1689
00:41:24.641 --> 00:41:27.640
<v Speaker 1>harder on the people who actually don't have the ability to go live somewhere</v>

1690
00:41:27.641 --> 00:41:28.300
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

1691
00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:28.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1692
00:41:28.601 --> 00:41:32.260
<v Speaker 1>It gets really tricky when they run out of places they can go to two because</v>

1693
00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:33.110
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

1694
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.150
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have a rent control type situation.</v>

1695
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1696
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:36.021
<v Speaker 1>Once,</v>

1697
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:37.220
<v Speaker 1>if they boot you out of that,</v>

1698
00:41:37.221 --> 00:41:38.001
<v Speaker 1>good fucking luck,</v>

1699
00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:39.410

1700
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:39.741
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1701
00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:39.960
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

00:41:40.141 --> 00:41:40.600
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1704
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 1>and as fear,</v>

1705
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.860
<v Speaker 1>if you're an old person,</v>

1706
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:43.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1721
00:41:58.581 --> 00:41:58.751
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1722
00:41:58.751 --> 00:42:00.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not nice but it's for $600 a months.</v>

1723
00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a nice,</v>

1724
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:02.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1725
00:42:02.331 --> 00:42:02.901
<v Speaker 1>like it's a,</v>

1726
00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:03.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1727
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1728
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:07.370
<v Speaker 1>and I think about that and there's no way anywhere in the bay area that she</v>

1729
00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:07.881
<v Speaker 1>could ever,</v>

1730
00:42:07.881 --> 00:42:09.410
<v Speaker 1>like we talked about her moving out there and I'm like,</v>

1731
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:09.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1732
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.071
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1733
00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:11.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making that FX money anymore.</v>

1734
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:12.530
<v Speaker 1>We have to figure out,</v>

1735
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1736
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.450
<v Speaker 1>we got to get something else going before we can move you out of here.</v>

1737
00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're not gonna find anything for $600 a month.</v>

1738
00:42:16.281 --> 00:42:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Berkeley's nice though.</v>

1739
00:42:17.271 --> 00:42:17.861
<v Speaker 1>I like Berkeley.</v>

1740
00:42:17.861 --> 00:42:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Berkeley is milk calm.</v>

1741
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:19.641
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

1742
00:42:19.641 --> 00:42:21.500
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting sort of environment.</v>

1743
00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:22.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a super leftie,</v>

1744
00:42:22.821 --> 00:42:23.900
<v Speaker 1>very hippy environment.</v>

1745
00:42:23.901 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 1>But it's also not,</v>

1746
00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.580
<v Speaker 1>it's also very sort of young and a little bit gutter punk too.</v>

1747
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:29.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>

1748
00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.960
<v Speaker 1>it's funny like if you go down by the downtown Berkeley Bart Station,</v>

1749
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:37.340
<v Speaker 1>it is very gutter punk and like sort of kid spare changing and you know it's a</v>

1750
00:42:37.341 --> 00:42:38.140
<v Speaker 1>very sort of,</v>

1751
00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:38.440
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1752
00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a place that those people hang out and I was down there with my daughter</v>

1753
00:42:41.451 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 1>pushing the stroller and I felt like the Weirdo,</v>

1754
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.170
<v Speaker 1>like pushing the baby store,</v>

1755
00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:46.520
<v Speaker 1>like we're not gonna get a baby frog.</v>

1756
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.421
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's weird.</v>

1757
00:42:48.421 --> 00:42:50.570
<v Speaker 1>He's selling it like I felt like I'm the Weirdo.</v>

1758
00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:51.710
<v Speaker 1>You guys are all in the streets.</v>

1759
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Well does that San Francisco and the bay area itself is so accepting of like</v>

1760
00:42:57.621 --> 00:42:58.540
<v Speaker 1>homeless people.</v>

1761
00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:00.351
<v Speaker 1>We all would foot,</v>

1762
00:43:00.351 --> 00:43:03.560
<v Speaker 1>I forgot how many like living in New York for two years in New York,</v>

1763
00:43:03.561 --> 00:43:04.910
<v Speaker 1>people think New York has a homeless problem.</v>

1764
00:43:04.911 --> 00:43:05.241
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1765
00:43:05.241 --> 00:43:05.661
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1766
00:43:05.661 --> 00:43:07.310
<v Speaker 1>you guys have about 12 dudes.</v>

1767
00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I've met them all while I was there.</v>

1768
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.580
<v Speaker 1>They're all very nice.</v>

1769
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:11.690
<v Speaker 1>But like San Francisco,</v>

1770
00:43:11.691 --> 00:43:12.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1771
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.010
<v Speaker 1>it's thick with it or the bay area because it's temperate and we have social</v>

1772
00:43:16.011 --> 00:43:17.520
<v Speaker 1>services for those people and that is,</v>

1773
00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:18.500
<v Speaker 1>that is a good thing.</v>

1774
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:21.470
<v Speaker 1>And I lived in a neighborhood where I knew all the homeless people and they were</v>

1775
00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:22.251
<v Speaker 1>all pretty cool.</v>

1776
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:24.170
<v Speaker 1>There was was really a time when I had a problem with it,</v>

1777
00:43:24.171 --> 00:43:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1778
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1779
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.110
<v Speaker 1>and they just do their thing and,</v>

1780
00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:27.561
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1781
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:28.191
<v Speaker 1>it's also great,</v>

1782
00:43:28.191 --> 00:43:31.070
<v Speaker 1>the hidden benefit of homeless people when you walk out of here in San</v>

1783
00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:31.071
<v Speaker 1>Francisco,</v>

1784
00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:33.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a culture of if you walk out of a restaurant and you have leftovers and</v>

1785
00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:35.150
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to eat them,</v>

1786
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.910
<v Speaker 1>you just put him on a trashcan and you blink and they're gone.</v>

1787
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1788
00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:39.530
<v Speaker 1>When you feel like you did something,</v>

1789
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.491
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1790
00:43:40.491 --> 00:43:41.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm a good person.</v>

1791
00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Whereas it's not that culture.</v>

1792
00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to be back in that culture.</v>

1793
00:43:44.601 --> 00:43:46.250
<v Speaker 1>You feel like I've done a good thing.</v>

1794
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:49.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm a charitable individual cause I didn't finish my spaghetti.</v>

1795
00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.353
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

1796
00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that,</v>

1797
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:52.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1798
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.610
<v Speaker 1>I think the real issue is a lot of these people are like,</v>

1799
00:43:55.790 --> 00:44:00.790
<v Speaker 1>they have mental issues and the mental health care in this country just doesn't,</v>

1800
00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:02.510
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>

1801
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:03.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not up to snuff.</v>

1802
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1803
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:08.030
<v Speaker 1>these people are just not being taken care of the way a culture should probably</v>

1804
00:44:08.031 --> 00:44:09.260
<v Speaker 1>look after its citizens.</v>

1805
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:09.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1806
00:44:09.411 --> 00:44:09.621
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1807
00:44:09.621 --> 00:44:10.340
<v Speaker 1>and I think I've,</v>

1808
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know this for sure,</v>

1809
00:44:11.541 --> 00:44:13.970
<v Speaker 1>but from what I heard in the barriers when Reagan was governor,</v>

1810
00:44:13.971 --> 00:44:14.740
<v Speaker 1>he turned out,</v>

1811
00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.220
<v Speaker 1>he opened up the doors in the hospital.</v>

1812
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:17.420
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just when he was governor,</v>

1813
00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:18.254
<v Speaker 1>when he was president,</v>

1814
00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:19.191
<v Speaker 1>he became president.</v>

1815
00:44:19.191 --> 00:44:20.000
<v Speaker 1>He changed the,</v>

1816
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:20.570
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1817
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.000
<v Speaker 1>what the requirements are and you know,</v>

1818
00:44:23.001 --> 00:44:23.260
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1819
00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:23.391
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1820
00:44:23.391 --> 00:44:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you guys can feed yourself.</v>

1821
00:44:24.441 --> 00:44:25.400
<v Speaker 1>You can put a fork to your mouth.</v>

1822
00:44:25.401 --> 00:44:26.234
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

1823
00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:26.931
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1824
00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:27.540
<v Speaker 1>you're free.</v>

1825
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.373
<v Speaker 1>You're free.</v>

1826
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Mental health issues are,</v>

1827
00:44:30.281 --> 00:44:31.080
<v Speaker 1>are serious and,</v>

1828
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:31.410
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

1829
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 1>and forget</v>

1830
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.311
<v Speaker 2>homes.</v>

1831
00:44:32.311 --> 00:44:32.690
<v Speaker 2>You will,</v>

1832
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:35.130
<v Speaker 2>America's probably number one issue with mental health issues.</v>

1833
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1834
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:38.530
<v Speaker 2>you know if the win when we go to the,</v>

1835
00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.870
<v Speaker 2>take it back to the football player thing,</v>

1836
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:43.050
<v Speaker 2>the NFL rookie symposium suit involves sitting down with a therapist and talking</v>

1837
00:44:43.051 --> 00:44:43.370
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1838
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:43.860
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1839
00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:44.101
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1840
00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:46.560
<v Speaker 2>you're about to make a lot of money and you had everything in life,</v>

1841
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.790
<v Speaker 2>but let's try to figure out what,</v>

1842
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:50.490
<v Speaker 2>what in your past is going to lead you to make bad decisions in the future?</v>

1843
00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.110
<v Speaker 2>That's all well and good,</v>

1844
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:55.080
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is you're never going to be able to change anybody out and have</v>

1845
00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.370
<v Speaker 2>a fucking conversation.</v>

1846
00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.960
<v Speaker 2>The reality being a guy who's poor to being a guy who's a fucking NFL superstar,</v>

1847
00:45:00.961 --> 00:45:02.040
<v Speaker 2>making millions of dollars.</v>

1848
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:03.091
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

1849
00:45:03.091 --> 00:45:03.811
<v Speaker 2>what a transition.</v>

1850
00:45:03.811 --> 00:45:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean one conversation.</v>

1851
00:45:04.961 --> 00:45:05.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1852
00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:05.904
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>

1853
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:06.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1854
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.051
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

1855
00:45:07.051 --> 00:45:07.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1856
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.900
<v Speaker 2>I actually feel like every black person in America that would,</v>

1857
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll take those reparations free therapy,</v>

1858
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:17.280
<v Speaker 2>just give every black person in America a free therapy session once a week for</v>

1859
00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:18.210
<v Speaker 2>the rest of their life.</v>

1860
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.280
<v Speaker 2>It will change the,</v>

1861
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:23.760
<v Speaker 2>it'll change American white people need therapy to speak for you people.</v>

1862
00:45:23.761 --> 00:45:24.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm just thinking,</v>

1863
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.140
<v Speaker 2>how dare you.</v>

1864
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:26.833
<v Speaker 2>You people,</v>

1865
00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:27.693
<v Speaker 2>you people,</v>

1866
00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:28.530
<v Speaker 2>that's how it works.</v>

1867
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:29.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1868
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm married to one of your people so I can say that.</v>

1869
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>

1870
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1871
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.390
<v Speaker 2>Thank God someone's doing it.</v>

1872
00:45:33.391 --> 00:45:34.224
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1873
00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:36.780
<v Speaker 2>I think also the,</v>

1874
00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.490
<v Speaker 2>the real problem with NFL players,</v>

1875
00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.230
<v Speaker 2>the unaddressed problem with mental health,</v>

1876
00:45:40.231 --> 00:45:42.210
<v Speaker 2>it's also the fucking concussions.</v>

1877
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1878
00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:47.490
<v Speaker 2>the one thing about concussions is it creates depression and it makes guys way</v>

1879
00:45:47.491 --> 00:45:50.100
<v Speaker 2>more susceptible to being impulsive violence,</v>

1880
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:50.971
<v Speaker 2>more PSAs.</v>

1881
00:45:50.971 --> 00:45:52.050
<v Speaker 2>And you're also,</v>

1882
00:45:52.051 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Speaker 2>you're so used to a violent world,</v>

1883
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.220
<v Speaker 2>a world of constant collisions and explosions and pushing people off you and</v>

1884
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.080
<v Speaker 2>screaming at people on the line.</v>

1885
00:46:01.081 --> 00:46:04.350
<v Speaker 2>And in that world it's Def,</v>

1886
00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:09.060
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to transition between that world and the calm world of domestic</v>

1887
00:46:09.061 --> 00:46:09.450
<v Speaker 2>living.</v>

1888
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:10.320
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's true.</v>

1889
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.690
<v Speaker 2>I just sit when sometimes when people say that they make it sound like that's an</v>

1890
00:46:12.691 --> 00:46:13.524
<v Speaker 2>excuse for what?</v>

1891
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.850
<v Speaker 2>For domestic abuse.</v>

1892
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:15.631
<v Speaker 2>That like,</v>

1893
00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:15.931
<v Speaker 2>well he's,</v>

1894
00:46:15.931 --> 00:46:18.240
<v Speaker 2>these are violent men and violet would a violent game.</v>

1895
00:46:18.241 --> 00:46:18.571
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like,</v>

1896
00:46:18.571 --> 00:46:18.721
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1897
00:46:18.721 --> 00:46:19.321
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

1898
00:46:19.321 --> 00:46:22.140
<v Speaker 2>But they still have to be human beings outside of that.</v>

1899
00:46:22.141 --> 00:46:22.791
<v Speaker 2>They still didn't get it.</v>

1900
00:46:22.791 --> 00:46:23.624
<v Speaker 2>They can't take it down.</v>

1901
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.810
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know the challenge of that.</v>

1902
00:46:24.811 --> 00:46:25.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's easy,</v>

1903
00:46:25.651 --> 00:46:26.910
<v Speaker 2>but I certainly feel like we have to,</v>

1904
00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:29.070
<v Speaker 2>you still have to walk around in society,</v>

1905
00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:29.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1906
00:46:29.521 --> 00:46:29.881
<v Speaker 2>unless we,</v>

1907
00:46:29.881 --> 00:46:30.681
<v Speaker 2>what do we just housing.</v>

1908
00:46:30.681 --> 00:46:34.710
<v Speaker 2>I felt players in a separate property and you know like in the sort of keep them</v>

1909
00:46:34.711 --> 00:46:36.210
<v Speaker 2>away from general population,</v>

1910
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:41.240
<v Speaker 2>but think it's something that the people that are involved in the sport from a</v>

1911
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:44.490
<v Speaker 2>high school to college coaches to everyone.</v>

1912
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.260
<v Speaker 2>It's something that's not addressed,</v>

1913
00:46:46.261 --> 00:46:49.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of the most difficult aspects of competitive athletics,</v>

1914
00:46:49.011 --> 00:46:49.801
<v Speaker 2>sports combat,</v>

1915
00:46:49.801 --> 00:46:50.610
<v Speaker 2>sports as it were.</v>

1916
00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1917
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:52.500
<v Speaker 2>I consider football combat sport.</v>

1918
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:53.120
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1919
00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:53.750
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1920
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are fucking run and knew each other full clip.</v>

1921
00:46:56.161 --> 00:46:57.090
<v Speaker 2>But if that's not comment,</v>

1922
00:46:57.091 --> 00:46:58.350
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck has no,</v>

1923
00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:58.831
<v Speaker 2>it absolutely.</v>

1924
00:46:58.831 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1925
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:04.130
<v Speaker 2>So I think that just the realities of dealing with being a combat athlete or any</v>

1926
00:47:04.351 --> 00:47:06.180
<v Speaker 2>sort of explosive athlete,</v>

1927
00:47:06.181 --> 00:47:08.970
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with physical contact on a regular basis,</v>

1928
00:47:08.971 --> 00:47:11.250
<v Speaker 2>call it whatever you want that that's,</v>

1929
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:16.280
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to be a functional member of a calm stayed normal society on top of</v>

1930
00:47:18.301 --> 00:47:18.900
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

1931
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.040
<v Speaker 2>At the same time he had the,</v>

1932
00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:23.400
<v Speaker 2>and just especially like the w like you're saying like to me I always think</v>

1933
00:47:23.401 --> 00:47:24.600
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that these guys,</v>

1934
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.961
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1935
00:47:24.961 --> 00:47:27.810
<v Speaker 2>it's like the professional athletes have been since high school now since</v>

1936
00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:29.560
<v Speaker 2>seventh or eighth grade been sort of,</v>

1937
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 2>the rules</v>

1938
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.310
<v Speaker 1>had been changed and they've been coddled and you you don't have to go clean.</v>

1939
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1940
00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:34.361
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1941
00:47:34.361 --> 00:47:34.961
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1942
00:47:34.961 --> 00:47:35.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1943
00:47:35.241 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1944
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:36.243
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1945
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.660
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go to class.</v>

1946
00:47:37.661 --> 00:47:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't have to do these things and you don't,</v>

1947
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:42.640
<v Speaker 1>and so sometimes they don't get the life skills that a regular person would get</v>

1948
00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 1>because they've been sort of segregated from regular society and you give</v>

1949
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:49.390
<v Speaker 1>somebody $1 million and tell him that they're the best and like the same thing.</v>

1950
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:49.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1951
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I feel the same way about comedy sometimes I come off stage after our goods that</v>

1952
00:47:52.181 --> 00:47:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I am the best thing this world has ever seen.</v>

1953
00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Well that's definitely an issue with like sitcoms,</v>

1954
00:47:58.121 --> 00:47:58.954
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>

1955
00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1956
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a big issue,</v>

1957
00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:00.880
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1958
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I've been around people that like run their own shows.</v>

1959
00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:04.730
<v Speaker 1>They have their own Sitcom,</v>

1960
00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.750
<v Speaker 1>they're yelling at the producer and yelling at the other actors and yelling at</v>

1961
00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:08.110
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

1962
00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:08.960
<v Speaker 1>And I mean there's,</v>

1963
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a hundred stories of like,</v>

1964
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1965
00:48:11.741 --> 00:48:12.281
<v Speaker 1>Roseanne,</v>

1966
00:48:12.281 --> 00:48:13.600
<v Speaker 1>when she was running the Roseanne show,</v>

1967
00:48:13.601 --> 00:48:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Brett Butler when she was on grace under fire.</v>

1968
00:48:15.671 --> 00:48:17.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's like you can go on and on and on.</v>

1969
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:22.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a million different stories that have to do with people that become the</v>

1970
00:48:22.721 --> 00:48:23.710
<v Speaker 1>star of a show.</v>

1971
00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.480
<v Speaker 1>It's the Kamau bell show.</v>

1972
00:48:25.481 --> 00:48:25.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1973
00:48:25.751 --> 00:48:27.140
<v Speaker 1>there were everybody shut the fuck up.</v>

1974
00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1975
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure if we brought in some of the staff and totally buys,</v>

1976
00:48:30.921 --> 00:48:32.470
<v Speaker 1>they would tell you stories about me like that,</v>

1977
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:32.891
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1978
00:48:32.891 --> 00:48:33.724
<v Speaker 1>And not that I,</v>

1979
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I sir.</v>

1980
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:36.280
<v Speaker 1>It's when you are putting a position where you're the focus,</v>

1981
00:48:36.281 --> 00:48:38.620
<v Speaker 1>everybody's attention for all day long,</v>

1982
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:39.454
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

1983
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.140
<v Speaker 1>I can say it tweaks your head.</v>

1984
00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Like it tweaked my head in a way that I certainly was not,</v>

1985
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:44.441
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I,</v>

1986
00:48:44.441 --> 00:48:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Brett Butler did ever,</v>

1987
00:48:45.431 --> 00:48:45.941
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I,</v>

1988
00:48:45.941 --> 00:48:46.481
<v Speaker 1>Roseanne did,</v>

1989
00:48:46.481 --> 00:48:46.600
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1990
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.260
<v Speaker 1>and maybe I should have.</v>

1991
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I should have because I think sometimes you have to sort of go,</v>

1992
00:48:49.721 --> 00:48:51.010
<v Speaker 1>everybody pay attention.</v>

1993
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:54.370
<v Speaker 1>But I certainly was not the best version of myself.</v>

1994
00:48:54.371 --> 00:48:56.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's one thing that when I left I felt like,</v>

1995
00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:57.041
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1996
00:48:57.041 --> 00:48:57.790
<v Speaker 1>I can sort of figure,</v>

1997
00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:00.220
<v Speaker 1>I can return back to that dude who got the show in the first place.</v>

1998
00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Well also a producer who comes up with a wacky idea that make would make you</v>

1999
00:49:04.421 --> 00:49:05.254
<v Speaker 1>look bad.</v>

2000
00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:06.490
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't hurt him.</v>

2001
00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:07.160
<v Speaker 1>If he,</v>

2002
00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:07.720
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2003
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.000
<v Speaker 1>if he talks you into doing this wacky idea and you're like,</v>

2004
00:49:10.001 --> 00:49:11.200
<v Speaker 1>this wacky idea sucks.</v>

2005
00:49:11.201 --> 00:49:11.471
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2006
00:49:11.471 --> 00:49:11.620
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2007
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:11.831
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2008
00:49:11.831 --> 00:49:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2009
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:13.181
<v Speaker 1>we talked this through.</v>

2010
00:49:13.181 --> 00:49:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Just give it a shot to play ball with her.</v>

2011
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2012
00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.610
<v Speaker 1>You're going to let you do that thing on rape jokes like you to do this thing</v>

2013
00:49:18.611 --> 00:49:19.260
<v Speaker 1>where you,</v>

2014
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:19.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2015
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:20.980
<v Speaker 1>you put fucking blackface on.</v>

2016
00:49:20.981 --> 00:49:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2017
00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.690
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I mean?</v>

2018
00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:22.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2019
00:49:22.901 --> 00:49:23.051
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2020
00:49:23.051 --> 00:49:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what you mean.</v>

2021
00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:24.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2022
00:49:24.341 --> 00:49:24.791
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>

2023
00:49:24.791 --> 00:49:25.541
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't work.</v>

2024
00:49:25.541 --> 00:49:26.830
<v Speaker 1>You look like a fucking idiot.</v>

2025
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.130
<v Speaker 1>They don't feel anything.</v>

2026
00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.900
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's also this thing where people think fit.</v>

2027
00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a like people,</v>

2028
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.260
<v Speaker 1>I think there's this weird thing in the entertainment issue now where some</v>

2029
00:49:35.261 --> 00:49:37.720
<v Speaker 1>people like they still don't get the internet and they go,</v>

2030
00:49:37.721 --> 00:49:41.170
<v Speaker 1>well you like it used to be Johnny Carson on the tonight show and did a stupid</v>

2031
00:49:41.171 --> 00:49:42.280
<v Speaker 1>thing that made you feel stupid.</v>

2032
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever could even do it.</v>

2033
00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.193
<v Speaker 1>See it again.</v>

2034
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:45.941
<v Speaker 1>It was gone.</v>

2035
00:49:45.941 --> 00:49:47.650
<v Speaker 1>It was in the annals of time.</v>

2036
00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:48.430
<v Speaker 1>But I'm like,</v>

2037
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.581
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2038
00:49:48.581 --> 00:49:49.660
<v Speaker 1>this exists forever.</v>

2039
00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Like if you make me do something stupid that I don't like to do,</v>

2040
00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:56.200
<v Speaker 1>I will be hearing about it for the rest of my life on some level.</v>

2041
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2042
00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.040
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

2043
00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:57.873
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>

2044
00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.730
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the thing you were saying about like it just becomes this thing</v>

2045
00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:02.740
<v Speaker 1>where it's a sea change.</v>

2046
00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.230
<v Speaker 1>You know it's also this different time hasn't,</v>

2047
00:50:05.231 --> 00:50:07.450
<v Speaker 1>they haven't caught up to the reality of it yet.</v>

2048
00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things about your show is you had a late night show but late</v>

2049
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.120
<v Speaker 1>night shows have become,</v>

2050
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:13.890
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

2051
00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:14.530
<v Speaker 1>they've had,</v>

2052
00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:18.310
<v Speaker 1>they have this sort of symbiotic relationship with the Internet now because one</v>

2053
00:50:18.311 --> 00:50:22.840
<v Speaker 1>of the big things is getting a clip that people find about online and they,</v>

2054
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:23.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2055
00:50:23.171 --> 00:50:23.711
<v Speaker 1>Facebook,</v>

2056
00:50:23.711 --> 00:50:25.450
<v Speaker 1>it back and forth to each other and you go,</v>

2057
00:50:25.451 --> 00:50:26.740
<v Speaker 1>oh listen to this cool,</v>

2058
00:50:26.741 --> 00:50:28.590
<v Speaker 1>funny thing that Conan did,</v>

2059
00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:29.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2060
00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.720
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll get this skit.</v>

2061
00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:31.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2062
00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:31.440
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2063
00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2064
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:35.240
<v Speaker 1>And that becomes a great way to get people aware of the show.</v>

2065
00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:40.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like the time that it's on is not nearly as important as the fact</v>

2066
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:41.300
<v Speaker 1>that it's being made.</v>

2067
00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:43.090
<v Speaker 1>And what the,</v>

2068
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:43.651
<v Speaker 1>I ran into him,</v>

2069
00:50:43.651 --> 00:50:44.001
<v Speaker 1>my shows,</v>

2070
00:50:44.001 --> 00:50:44.660
<v Speaker 1>cause I wasn't,</v>

2071
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:45.740
<v Speaker 1>I didn't grow up wanting to,</v>

2072
00:50:45.741 --> 00:50:46.760
<v Speaker 1>because I read every book,</v>

2073
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.110
<v Speaker 1>the late books that Bill Carter Road,</v>

2074
00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.950
<v Speaker 1>all those dudes grew up wanting to be late night talk show host like Conan and</v>

2075
00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Kimmel and they all kids.</v>

2076
00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Letterman was a hero and Carson was their hero.</v>

2077
00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I didn't grow up that way.</v>

2078
00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:58.041
<v Speaker 1>I grew up,</v>

2079
00:50:58.041 --> 00:50:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Chris Rock was my hero.</v>

2080
00:50:59.031 --> 00:50:59.451
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2081
00:50:59.451 --> 00:51:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to be a standup and he had a show on HBO then I was like,</v>

2082
00:51:02.991 --> 00:51:03.561
<v Speaker 1>I want it.</v>

2083
00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:04.041
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't,</v>

2084
00:51:04.041 --> 00:51:06.350
<v Speaker 1>nobody thought it was a late night shows the Chris rock show.</v>

2085
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:06.741
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2086
00:51:06.741 --> 00:51:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean Stuart,</v>

2087
00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I like Stuart.</v>

2088
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Like that's hits the Jon Stewart show.</v>

2089
00:51:10.131 --> 00:51:11.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not a late night talk show,</v>

2090
00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 1>but once I got put in that world,</v>

2091
00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:14.630
<v Speaker 1>suddenly there was this thing about like,</v>

2092
00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:18.290
<v Speaker 1>do you have any famous friends we could put on here who could come in here?</v>

2093
00:51:18.291 --> 00:51:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Like the way that Fallon does a thing with Justin Timberlake and Fallon was on</v>

2094
00:51:22.191 --> 00:51:23.870
<v Speaker 1>SNL for eight years.</v>

2095
00:51:23.871 --> 00:51:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Like he knows his Rolodex is filled with everybody.</v>

2096
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I was in the bay area,</v>

2097
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:27.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2098
00:51:27.711 --> 00:51:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the ability to reach out to this pain near a meth sign.</v>

2099
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:31.641
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2100
00:51:31.641 --> 00:51:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2101
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:32.281
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2102
00:51:32.281 --> 00:51:32.811
<v Speaker 1>I was not going,</v>

2103
00:51:32.811 --> 00:51:33.051
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2104
00:51:33.051 --> 00:51:35.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to crystal meth and I'll call the guy from the poster.</v>

2105
00:51:35.541 --> 00:51:38.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll call the the Asian twink from the poster to come on the show.</v>

2106
00:51:38.601 --> 00:51:39.040
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2107
00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:39.531
<v Speaker 1>be careful.</v>

2108
00:51:39.531 --> 00:51:43.580
<v Speaker 1>You can't say twink Andy Collin got in trouble for saying twink.</v>

2109
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh is that?</v>

2110
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:44.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2111
00:51:44.421 --> 00:51:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I certainly,</v>

2112
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm calling them that because that's the,</v>

2113
00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.960
<v Speaker 1>they were portraying it was that way.</v>

2114
00:51:47.961 --> 00:51:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that all areas are twins.</v>

2115
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Twink you not allowed to use it anymore and decided not to say that one.</v>

2116
00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:57.080
<v Speaker 1>The guy that had a bravo who's,</v>

2117
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:57.680
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

2118
00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:57.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2119
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:58.311
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2120
00:51:58.311 --> 00:52:00.380
<v Speaker 1>I got in trouble for saying someone's a perfect twink.</v>

2121
00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:01.970
<v Speaker 1>It's preposterous.</v>

2122
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:02.301
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2123
00:52:02.301 --> 00:52:02.570
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2124
00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:03.230
<v Speaker 1>it's again,</v>

2125
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:05.090
<v Speaker 1>it's everybody seeing everybody's shit.</v>

2126
00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:05.721
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2127
00:52:05.721 --> 00:52:06.650
<v Speaker 1>they used to be that you could only,</v>

2128
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:09.020
<v Speaker 1>you only saw your shit and the shit you interested in.</v>

2129
00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:09.520
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2130
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.030
<v Speaker 1>and when you're the head of a network,</v>

2131
00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a totally different deal.</v>

2132
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:15.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I said it and somebody may tweeted me and told me,</v>

2133
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I have to say,</v>

2134
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.581
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

2135
00:52:16.581 --> 00:52:16.970
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2136
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:19.370
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not responsible for billions of dollars.</v>

2137
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.340
<v Speaker 1>If someone does tweet you and tells you not retweet the shit out of that,</v>

2138
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.300
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean that to let people know that everybody in that little cool look</v>

2139
00:52:26.301 --> 00:52:26.661
<v Speaker 1>at this,</v>

2140
00:52:26.661 --> 00:52:27.494
<v Speaker 1>talk to this guy.</v>

2141
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:27.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2142
00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:27.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2143
00:52:27.951 --> 00:52:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I've let people react,</v>

2144
00:52:28.861 --> 00:52:29.511
<v Speaker 1>said people.</v>

2145
00:52:29.511 --> 00:52:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2146
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2147
00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:34.400
<v Speaker 1>the thing I like to do that when people say shitty things to me that I think are</v>

2148
00:52:34.401 --> 00:52:35.720
<v Speaker 1>actually just shitty and not helpful.</v>

2149
00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2150
00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:37.640
<v Speaker 1>I've turned a few people,</v>

2151
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:38.031
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2152
00:52:38.031 --> 00:52:38.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2153
00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I've made people apologize.</v>

2154
00:52:39.501 --> 00:52:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

2155
00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:40.371
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2156
00:52:40.371 --> 00:52:42.020
<v Speaker 1>just out of sheer,</v>

2157
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:46.370
<v Speaker 1>like I kido sort of like taking their energy and putting it in the wall and</v>

2158
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:46.581
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

2159
00:52:46.581 --> 00:52:48.110
<v Speaker 1>and then bringing them back to you and do it again,</v>

2160
00:52:48.111 --> 00:52:50.000
<v Speaker 1>and then we just put it back in the wall and then they go,</v>

2161
00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:50.541
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2162
00:52:50.541 --> 00:52:50.900
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

2163
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:51.651
<v Speaker 1>You're pretty good guy.</v>

2164
00:52:51.651 --> 00:52:52.484
<v Speaker 1>I was probably out of luck.</v>

2165
00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Like that's my favorite thing to do is to turn people on Twitter.</v>

2166
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that a lot of people are doing it just to get your attention?</v>

2167
00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:57.980
<v Speaker 1>There?</v>

2168
00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:58.671
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely are.</v>

2169
00:52:58.671 --> 00:53:01.250
<v Speaker 1>But that's why I think it's fun if you can actually make them feel bad for</v>

2170
00:53:01.251 --> 00:53:02.084
<v Speaker 1>getting your attention and,</v>

2171
00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:04.850
<v Speaker 1>but not from like calling them now from yelling at them,</v>

2172
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.310
<v Speaker 1>but from taking their energy and sort of like,</v>

2173
00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.020
<v Speaker 1>actually sometimes people will say,</v>

2174
00:53:09.021 --> 00:53:11.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm not shitting you actually treat it like it's serious and well,</v>

2175
00:53:11.541 --> 00:53:11.781
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2176
00:53:11.781 --> 00:53:12.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2177
00:53:12.051 --> 00:53:12.381
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>

2178
00:53:12.381 --> 00:53:12.561
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2179
00:53:12.561 --> 00:53:13.394
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

2180
00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:13.970
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2181
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:15.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to listen to what you're saying.</v>

2182
00:53:15.011 --> 00:53:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

2183
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:17.660
<v Speaker 1>and they get frustrated because you're not mad.</v>

2184
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:19.250
<v Speaker 1>And I like to win.</v>

2185
00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:19.941
<v Speaker 1>Not that I do is,</v>

2186
00:53:19.941 --> 00:53:21.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like when I'm on the road and I'm by myself,</v>

2187
00:53:21.381 --> 00:53:21.681
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2188
00:53:21.681 --> 00:53:21.981
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2189
00:53:21.981 --> 00:53:22.221
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

2190
00:53:22.221 --> 00:53:22.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2191
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:23.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2192
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm not yelling at them.</v>

2193
00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking with them back</v>

2194
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.490
<v Speaker 2>in a way that they don't realize that,</v>

2195
00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:28.730
<v Speaker 2>that you should be mad.</v>

2196
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:28.960
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2197
00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Now they know.</v>

2198
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2199
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2200
00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:30.420
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2201
00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:30.600
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2202
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.433
<v Speaker 2>Your strategy,</v>

2203
00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:34.710
<v Speaker 2>some fucking news of attack.</v>

2204
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:35.551
<v Speaker 2>We'll see what happens.</v>

2205
00:53:35.551 --> 00:53:36.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready for it.</v>

2206
00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:37.253
<v Speaker 2>Or I'll just ignore it.</v>

2207
00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:39.541
<v Speaker 2>I'll just ignore it.</v>

2208
00:53:39.541 --> 00:53:39.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2209
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:40.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2210
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:40.291
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2211
00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Some new matador tactics you're going to have to come up with.</v>

2212
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2213
00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.460
<v Speaker 2>Dealing with people online is amazing.</v>

2214
00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:45.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

2215
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.800
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing thing that no one was prepared for that you know,</v>

2216
00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:51.330
<v Speaker 2>interacting with people on message boards,</v>

2217
00:53:51.331 --> 00:53:51.901
<v Speaker 2>on Twitter,</v>

2218
00:53:51.901 --> 00:53:53.280
<v Speaker 2>on Facebook and all these different,</v>

2219
00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 2>if we had this at the beginning of the United States of America,</v>

2220
00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:57.240
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't be in the future right now.</v>

2221
00:53:57.241 --> 00:54:00.930
<v Speaker 2>We'd still be in like wagons and buggies like I feel like it's ticket.</v>

2222
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.180
<v Speaker 2>It is slowing down progress.</v>

2223
00:54:03.181 --> 00:54:04.620
<v Speaker 2>By the time they were all spinning,</v>

2224
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:06.120
<v Speaker 2>arguing about bullshit online.</v>

2225
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think though that,</v>

2226
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:08.130
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2227
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:12.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with a lot of the social justice warriors and their tactics and</v>

2228
00:54:12.151 --> 00:54:14.940
<v Speaker 2>the professional victim mentality that a lot of them portray,</v>

2229
00:54:14.941 --> 00:54:17.840
<v Speaker 2>but in I feel like our student for good people,</v>

2230
00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:20.580
<v Speaker 2>I feel like social justice people and professional victims.</v>

2231
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:22.290
<v Speaker 2>I just think that's isn't that two different groups of people?</v>

2232
00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:23.400
<v Speaker 2>It can be.</v>

2233
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:23.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2234
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:24.160
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

2235
00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Point is like really whiny,</v>

2236
00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.510
<v Speaker 2>overly sensitive,</v>

2237
00:54:27.511 --> 00:54:28.770
<v Speaker 2>super progressive,</v>

2238
00:54:28.771 --> 00:54:29.730
<v Speaker 2>aggressive people.</v>

2239
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:35.270
<v Speaker 2>I think though that it opens up the dialogue and forces people to even,</v>

2240
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:38.490
<v Speaker 2>even if you're communicating about it in a way where you're defending your</v>

2241
00:54:38.491 --> 00:54:39.324
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

2242
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:42.390
<v Speaker 2>that that conversation gets like a perfect one.</v>

2243
00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:44.750
<v Speaker 2>The perfect subject is a,</v>

2244
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.680
<v Speaker 2>this subject is coming up a lot lately,</v>

2245
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:47.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2246
00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:50.700
<v Speaker 2>where a lot of feminists are trying to push the idea that if a person has sex</v>

2247
00:54:50.701 --> 00:54:51.870
<v Speaker 2>with someone that's been drinking,</v>

2248
00:54:51.871 --> 00:54:52.704
<v Speaker 2>that it's rape,</v>

2249
00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:54.720
<v Speaker 2>they're saying yes,</v>

2250
00:54:54.721 --> 00:54:55.950
<v Speaker 2>they're saying you can't consent,</v>

2251
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.813
<v Speaker 2>including men.</v>

2252
00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:58.890
<v Speaker 2>They're saying a woman having sex with a drunk man,</v>

2253
00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.210
<v Speaker 2>she's raping that man because he,</v>

2254
00:55:00.211 --> 00:55:02.010
<v Speaker 2>he's not able to consent because he's drinking.</v>

2255
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2256
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.020
<v Speaker 2>I think it's ridiculous.</v>

2257
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

2258
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:07.680
<v Speaker 2>some of us wouldn't be here without exactly sex.</v>

2259
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:08.221
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

2260
00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:10.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a giant spectrum of what intoxication is.</v>

2261
00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:11.190
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

2262
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:16.190
<v Speaker 2>it takes away a lot of responsibility where you are forced to be responsible for</v>

2263
00:55:16.771 --> 00:55:17.311
<v Speaker 2>your actions.</v>

2264
00:55:17.311 --> 00:55:18.270
<v Speaker 2>If you're driving,</v>

2265
00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 2>you're forced to be responsible for your actions.</v>

2266
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:22.770
<v Speaker 2>If you engage in a violent activity,</v>

2267
00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 2>but somehow or another,</v>

2268
00:55:24.061 --> 00:55:27.000
<v Speaker 2>if you're drinking and someone had sex with you,</v>

2269
00:55:27.001 --> 00:55:30.600
<v Speaker 2>you were raped the same amount of intoxication that you would be liable for</v>

2270
00:55:30.601 --> 00:55:32.490
<v Speaker 2>driving liable for violent actions.</v>

2271
00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Now you're not liable for your actions.</v>

2272
00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:35.431
<v Speaker 2>It seems ridiculous.</v>

2273
00:55:35.431 --> 00:55:36.264
<v Speaker 2>And it also,</v>

2274
00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:36.660
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2275
00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:40.110
<v Speaker 2>it discredits women in a lot of ways because you're saying that they,</v>

2276
00:55:40.111 --> 00:55:44.310
<v Speaker 2>they're not capable of forming their own decisions and deciding that they want</v>

2277
00:55:44.311 --> 00:55:47.340
<v Speaker 2>to have a couple of drinks and fuck some guy because you know,</v>

2278
00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.300
<v Speaker 2>women do that.</v>

2279
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:48.650
<v Speaker 2>They will have,</v>

2280
00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:50.790
<v Speaker 2>if you need a couple of days where you fuck some guy just to it because</v>

2281
00:55:50.791 --> 00:55:52.080
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you're not gonna wanna fuck that guy.</v>

2282
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:55.830
<v Speaker 2>And it's fun and it's Friday evening and he had a hard week.</v>

2283
00:55:55.831 --> 00:55:56.401
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2284
00:55:56.401 --> 00:55:57.270
<v Speaker 2>He's not the good looking guy.</v>

2285
00:55:57.271 --> 00:55:58.350
<v Speaker 2>You thought you'd meet at the bar.</v>

2286
00:55:58.380 --> 00:55:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2287
00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.040
<v Speaker 2>And they're having a good time mean there's not always a negative thing.</v>

2288
00:56:02.041 --> 00:56:05.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's the problem with broad strokes like painting with broad strokes.</v>

2289
00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:10.620
<v Speaker 2>But in introducing this dialog and discussion and making people angry about this</v>

2290
00:56:10.621 --> 00:56:11.280
<v Speaker 2>debate,</v>

2291
00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:15.660
<v Speaker 2>they are bringing up the very real situation of people drugging people and</v>

2292
00:56:15.661 --> 00:56:17.340
<v Speaker 2>getting people drunk and having sex with him,</v>

2293
00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:21.060
<v Speaker 2>which is disgusting and is rape and is immoral.</v>

2294
00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:24.180
<v Speaker 2>So I think even in like when they pushed</v>

2295
00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:26.200
<v Speaker 1>the needle way too far to the left though,</v>

2296
00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that balances out a little bit.</v>

2297
00:56:27.701 --> 00:56:29.170
<v Speaker 1>The point is that you sometimes you can't,</v>

2298
00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:30.370
<v Speaker 1>it's like the thing where if you go,</v>

2299
00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:30.641
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2300
00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:31.810
<v Speaker 1>can we talk about a rape?</v>

2301
00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

2302
00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:33.640
<v Speaker 1>can wait just for a second.</v>

2303
00:56:33.641 --> 00:56:34.474
<v Speaker 1>Talking about Nano Tech.</v>

2304
00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2305
00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:37.013
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2306
00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:39.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big of a deal.</v>

2307
00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:39.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2308
00:56:39.941 --> 00:56:40.630
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>

2309
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:41.463
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

2310
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:44.950
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is certainly is as the culture of oppressed people,</v>

2311
00:56:44.951 --> 00:56:47.440
<v Speaker 1>is it the culture of repress being oppressed in America is that people don't</v>

2312
00:56:47.441 --> 00:56:49.290
<v Speaker 1>hear you when you ask permission for the science,</v>

2313
00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:50.530
<v Speaker 1>but people don't hear you when you say,</v>

2314
00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to talk about racism in America and just see if we can finally,</v>

2315
00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:54.670
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to hear that.</v>

2316
00:56:54.671 --> 00:56:55.504
<v Speaker 1>So you have to,</v>

2317
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I love when there's people sometimes so far because the right is filled with</v>

2318
00:56:59.441 --> 00:57:02.080
<v Speaker 1>people who are so far on the right and don't,</v>

2319
00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:04.390
<v Speaker 1>and they're always like barking and people can get a lot of attention.</v>

2320
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:06.610
<v Speaker 1>The left is historically been ashamed of that.</v>

2321
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't want to get too loud and we ride.</v>

2322
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.440
<v Speaker 1>And so for me it's like we need a couple of those people who are,</v>

2323
00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:12.130
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

2324
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:12.950
<v Speaker 1>who make,</v>

2325
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:13.280
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

2326
00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.160
<v Speaker 1>who shows where the middle should be.</v>

2327
00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:15.761
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2328
00:57:15.761 --> 00:57:16.511
<v Speaker 1>who was like so far,</v>

2329
00:57:16.511 --> 00:57:16.691
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2330
00:57:16.691 --> 00:57:17.620
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to do that.</v>

2331
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:19.480
<v Speaker 1>But like you said,</v>

2332
00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:22.240
<v Speaker 1>the pendulum has to be pushed that far to get it back to the middle.</v>

2333
00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:22.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2334
00:57:22.811 --> 00:57:23.530
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

2335
00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:24.340
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2336
00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.650
<v Speaker 1>well I don't know if it has to be,</v>

2337
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.750
<v Speaker 1>but it aids in that.</v>

2338
00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:30.081
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2339
00:57:30.081 --> 00:57:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is an example of a little example of it.</v>

2340
00:57:32.771 --> 00:57:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Like people will say that occupy Wall Street didn't accomplish anything.</v>

2341
00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:36.873
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

2342
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:41.020
<v Speaker 1>we didn't talk about the words income inequality ever in this country until</v>

2343
00:57:41.021 --> 00:57:41.854
<v Speaker 1>occupy Wall Street.</v>

2344
00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2345
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:42.940
<v Speaker 1>it introduced the frame,</v>

2346
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.030
<v Speaker 1>the frame of the 1% and so people say it didn't accomplish a thing it,</v>

2347
00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:51.190
<v Speaker 1>but by going to the parks and sitting out and getting your bond goes out and you</v>

2348
00:57:51.191 --> 00:57:51.371
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2349
00:57:51.371 --> 00:57:51.761
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

2350
00:57:51.761 --> 00:57:52.101
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2351
00:57:52.101 --> 00:57:55.360
<v Speaker 1>in knitting for justice or whatever and feeding people and giving out books.</v>

2352
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Now that is in the,</v>

2353
00:57:56.831 --> 00:57:58.060
<v Speaker 1>people will say people on the right,</v>

2354
00:57:58.061 --> 00:58:01.600
<v Speaker 1>we'll say income inequality and the 1% not realizing that they've adopted the</v>

2355
00:58:01.601 --> 00:58:02.620
<v Speaker 1>speech of the left.</v>

2356
00:58:02.621 --> 00:58:03.220
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2357
00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:07.390
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes you have to have a Tantrum to get some attention.</v>

2358
00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:10.390
<v Speaker 1>And I think coming from a historically black people,</v>

2359
00:58:10.391 --> 00:58:11.230
<v Speaker 1>we are used to like,</v>

2360
00:58:11.231 --> 00:58:11.471
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2361
00:58:11.471 --> 00:58:12.191
<v Speaker 1>we need to have a tantrum.</v>

2362
00:58:12.191 --> 00:58:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that Tantrum is inventing rock and roll and sometimes it's a million</v>

2363
00:58:15.821 --> 00:58:16.421
<v Speaker 1>men march.</v>

2364
00:58:16.421 --> 00:58:16.750
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2365
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:17.141
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2366
00:58:17.141 --> 00:58:17.561
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

2367
00:58:17.561 --> 00:58:19.150
<v Speaker 1>that's the nature of being,</v>

2368
00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:21.130
<v Speaker 1>of getting attention to Americans in a press group.</v>

2369
00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:21.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2370
00:58:21.551 --> 00:58:26.551
<v Speaker 1>it's also the first time ever where people can uniquely start a movement online</v>

2371
00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:28.900
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

2372
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:33.020
<v Speaker 1>they don't need like an office somewhere where they hire a bunch of people or I</v>

2373
00:58:33.021 --> 00:58:36.730
<v Speaker 1>need to know anybody or even see anybody personally who that who is helping them</v>

2374
00:58:36.731 --> 00:58:37.564
<v Speaker 1>make the movement happen.</v>

2375
00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2376
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:38.950
<v Speaker 1>this is happening all the time.</v>

2377
00:58:38.951 --> 00:58:42.130
<v Speaker 1>This climate march on DM on New York City,</v>

2378
00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:44.230
<v Speaker 1>they fucking clogged up the streets,</v>

2379
00:58:44.231 --> 00:58:44.600
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2380
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2381
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2382
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:46.451
<v Speaker 1>On the climate,</v>

2383
00:58:46.451 --> 00:58:47.020
<v Speaker 1>nobody is,</v>

2384
00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:48.160
<v Speaker 1>that's not a sexy issue.</v>

2385
00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Nobody is like,</v>

2386
00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:49.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2387
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:50.021
<v Speaker 1>you know that's not,</v>

2388
00:58:50.021 --> 00:58:52.960
<v Speaker 1>but they got the word out and made people think is important,</v>

2389
00:58:52.961 --> 00:58:53.741
<v Speaker 1>which I believe it is,</v>

2390
00:58:53.741 --> 00:58:56.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a thing where it's like as a person who's like,</v>

2391
00:58:56.411 --> 00:58:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I have other issues that I'd like to see the streets clogged up with,</v>

2392
00:58:59.170 --> 00:58:59.831
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>

2393
00:58:59.831 --> 00:59:00.040
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2394
00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad we're getting the streets clogged.</v>

2395
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:01.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2396
00:59:01.751 --> 00:59:05.710
<v Speaker 1>well it's a fascinating time when you see these movements and they see how big</v>

2397
00:59:05.711 --> 00:59:07.900
<v Speaker 1>they are and right now nonviolent peaceful.</v>

2398
00:59:07.901 --> 00:59:12.901
<v Speaker 1>But the government be sure is aware that this could also be a large protest.</v>

2399
00:59:14.211 --> 00:59:15.280
<v Speaker 1>It turns violent.</v>

2400
00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:17.830
<v Speaker 1>I can overthrow the government type protest.</v>

2401
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>

2402
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:21.560
<v Speaker 1>this guy that just fucking broken to the White House other day,</v>

2403
00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:23.030
<v Speaker 1>the guy half the fence,</v>

2404
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:23.841
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

2405
00:59:23.841 --> 00:59:25.840
<v Speaker 1>like 900 rounds of Ammo in his car,</v>

2406
00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:28.760
<v Speaker 1>duck tape and fucking just climbed the fence and ran.</v>

2407
00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:29.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2408
00:59:29.001 --> 00:59:29.691
<v Speaker 1>I hate when it's like,</v>

2409
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:31.520
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even like a ocean's 11 plan.</v>

2410
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:32.820
<v Speaker 1>It was like it was just the,</v>

2411
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:36.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to climb the fence and run and get to the door fucking door.</v>

2412
00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:36.883
<v Speaker 1>How many I,</v>

2413
00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.870
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to feel like how many,</v>

2414
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:40.003
<v Speaker 1>what is happening?</v>

2415
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.611
<v Speaker 1>There's got it.</v>

2416
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Speaker 1>There's multiple levels of security at the White House.</v>

2417
00:59:42.561 --> 00:59:43.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not just one guy who was like,</v>

2418
00:59:43.701 --> 00:59:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see him.</v>

2419
00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:45.213
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking,</v>

2420
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:46.490
<v Speaker 1>it's not the greeter at Walmart.</v>

2421
00:59:46.491 --> 00:59:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Like you know how many levels of secure have to break down for him to get into</v>

2422
00:59:49.731 --> 00:59:51.290
<v Speaker 1>the White House and why is that happening?</v>

2423
00:59:51.690 --> 00:59:52.523
<v Speaker 1>Do they suck?</v>

2424
00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:52.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2425
00:59:52.751 --> 00:59:53.331
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2426
00:59:53.331 --> 00:59:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2427
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:57.440
<v Speaker 1>And why is my question in the era of the black president,</v>

2428
00:59:57.441 --> 01:00:00.580
<v Speaker 1>why does this have to be with us today sucked in the era of the Bush presidency.</v>

2429
01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2430
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.710
<v Speaker 1>But I just feel like just take it more to the same thing happened.</v>

2431
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:06.140
<v Speaker 1>The guy broke into the White House and got in the White House lawn when the</v>

2432
01:00:06.141 --> 01:00:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Bush,</v>

2433
01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:09.170
<v Speaker 1>when Bush was president as well playing into the White House,</v>

2434
01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:10.004
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2435
01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:10.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2436
01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>that was the Pentagon.</v>

2437
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:15.380
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about when like are a small plane like a,</v>

2438
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>not like a real long time ago though,</v>

2439
01:00:17.151 --> 01:00:17.690
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>

2440
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:18.523
<v Speaker 1>When was that?</v>

2441
01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Google that shit.</v>

2442
01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:20.143
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2443
01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>But hold that.</v>

2444
01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Shaming the fence and running and getting in the front door.</v>

2445
01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:24.831
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

2446
01:00:24.831 --> 01:00:27.140
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that is there's no sophistication to that.</v>

2447
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>That should be the easiest thing.</v>

2448
01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Unleashed the hounds.</v>

2449
01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:30.381
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2450
01:00:30.381 --> 01:00:31.214
<v Speaker 1>We're done with that.</v>

2451
01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:31.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2452
01:00:31.491 --> 01:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Well they'd have to be on point 24 seven looking at for any,</v>

2453
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:35.590
<v Speaker 1>there was another woman that</v>

2454
01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.680
<v Speaker 1>got shot recently.</v>

2455
01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2456
01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Then the woman gets shot.</v>

2457
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.710
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2458
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:47.710
<v Speaker 1>she showed up at the White House and our car and broke through a barrier that</v>

2459
01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:48.590
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2460
01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:50.390
<v Speaker 1>you said they have to be on point in 12 hours.</v>

2461
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:51.320
<v Speaker 1>I think they're supposed to be.</v>

2462
01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2463
01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the Gig,</v>

2464
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>but the point is that these movements that you see like in New York City where</v>

2465
01:00:56.401 --> 01:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>the clog in the streets,</v>

2466
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>that could easily happen at the White House.</v>

2467
01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2468
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.550
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking terrifying for them.</v>

2469
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:06.170
<v Speaker 1>If a million people just stormed the White House and tore it to the ground,</v>

2470
01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.660
<v Speaker 1>stomped to death,</v>

2471
01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:11.690
<v Speaker 1>I'll just fucking secret service agents were holding their heads up to the of</v>

2472
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.160
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2473
01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:16.670
<v Speaker 1>That shit is not outside the realm of possibility if everything goes horribly</v>

2474
01:01:16.671 --> 01:01:17.001
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

2475
01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:17.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2476
01:01:17.151 --> 01:01:17.331
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2477
01:01:17.331 --> 01:01:17.691
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

2478
01:01:17.691 --> 01:01:17.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2479
01:01:17.991 --> 01:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2480
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Isis is doing a good job recruiting people right now with some Hollywood style</v>

2481
01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:22.431
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

2482
01:01:22.431 --> 01:01:22.910
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2483
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>if somebody in America picked up that ball,</v>

2484
01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:24.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2485
01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what the White House is afraid of right now.</v>

2486
01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Is it clearly isis or Isol,</v>

2487
01:01:28.821 --> 01:01:29.654
<v Speaker 1>whatever you call it,</v>

2488
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.860
<v Speaker 1>is recruiting from here.</v>

2489
01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:32.031
<v Speaker 1>We've got a Middle East,</v>

2490
01:01:32.031 --> 01:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>not just,</v>

2491
01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:33.200
<v Speaker 1>not very many,</v>

2492
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.213
<v Speaker 1>but at least it's,</v>

2493
01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2494
01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:35.990
<v Speaker 1>it's stirring the pot here in a way.</v>

2495
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Nobody thought al Qaeda was recruiting firm.</v>

2496
01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:38.630
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2497
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.751
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2498
01:01:38.751 --> 01:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>going to get American people to do every now and again,</v>

2499
01:01:40.611 --> 01:01:41.000
<v Speaker 1>there was one,</v>

2500
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.570
<v Speaker 1>but this is like actually there's a sense that they are recruited that like</v>

2501
01:01:44.571 --> 01:01:46.130
<v Speaker 1>there was that in that video that they released,</v>

2502
01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.280
<v Speaker 1>there's the one shot of,</v>

2503
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

2504
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>like a cell phone video of somebody driving past the White House and shooting</v>

2505
01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.433
<v Speaker 1>video of the White House,</v>

2506
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>which everybody can do.</v>

2507
01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.160
<v Speaker 1>But the fact it was in the isis videos like,</v>

2508
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.790
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

2509
01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2510
01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:59.290
<v Speaker 1>it implies something that is not.</v>

2511
01:01:59.450 --> 01:01:59.841
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2512
01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:00.674
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

2513
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2514
01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>we could do that.</v>

2515
01:02:02.541 --> 01:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>But until we,</v>

2516
01:02:04.161 --> 01:02:04.421
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2517
01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:07.960
<v Speaker 1>the only way that happens in America is you have to make it seem legitimate and</v>

2518
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:09.020
<v Speaker 1>you have to make it sexy.</v>

2519
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Occupy Wall Street became sexy for,</v>

2520
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:13.430
<v Speaker 1>for a few months if we need like an ice bucket challenge.</v>

2521
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:15.850
<v Speaker 1>The ice bucket challenge did it,</v>

2522
01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.773
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

2523
01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I going to scale the White House and I challenge 94</v>

2524
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.290
<v Speaker 2>man killed and suicidal plane crash in the white now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2533
01:02:33.451 --> 01:02:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Playing is different though because you can't like,</v>

2534
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:35.940
<v Speaker 2>oh the plane coming.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2539

<v Speaker 2>That shit,</v>

2540
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:45.630
<v Speaker 2>that's not well thought out and it should not be a thing that he got to the</v>

2541
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:45.811
<v Speaker 2>White House door.</v>

2542
01:02:45.811 --> 01:02:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Should have been,</v>

2543
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:46.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm over the fence.</v>

2554
01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:02.850
<v Speaker 2>It should be a thing where you get inside.</v>

2561
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:13.913
<v Speaker 2>If they were,</v>

2562
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.000
<v Speaker 2>it would be a tighter ship.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2568
01:03:19.021 --> 01:03:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2569
01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:19.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2570
01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:20.880
<v Speaker 2>And it wouldn't kill the guy on the spot.</v>

2571
01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:22.260
<v Speaker 2>They drag them into the house first.</v>

2572
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:22.451
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2573
01:03:22.451 --> 01:03:23.111
<v Speaker 2>they talked to them.</v>

2574
01:03:23.111 --> 01:03:24.450
<v Speaker 2>They have a conversation with them first.</v>

2575
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2576
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:27.151
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2577
01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't think in our lifetime we're gonna,</v>

2578
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we're going to ever see like some sort of a,</v>

2579
01:03:31.651 --> 01:03:36.651
<v Speaker 2>a crazy million group of people that are storming the government like we saw in</v>

2580
01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Egypt like we saw in Libya.</v>

2581
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:39.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2582
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:40.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2583
01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2584
01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>

2585
01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:45.630
<v Speaker 2>we'd have to really get to a strange place to make that happen,</v>

2586
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.430
<v Speaker 2>to get that many people on the same page.</v>

2587
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:48.540
<v Speaker 2>You will also have that kind of,</v>

2588
01:03:48.541 --> 01:03:52.410
<v Speaker 2>cause even the tea party and the further right versions of that aren't doing</v>

2589
01:03:52.411 --> 01:03:52.621
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2590
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:55.800
<v Speaker 2>They have all the guns but they're not prepared to do that with them.</v>

2591
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.300
<v Speaker 2>And also there's no,</v>

2592
01:03:57.470 --> 01:04:02.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean besides September 11th there's no notable attacks on America in America.</v>

2593
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:03.510
<v Speaker 2>This Pearl Harbor,</v>

2594
01:04:03.511 --> 01:04:04.620
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of America.</v>

2595
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2596
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Sort of America.</v>

2597
01:04:05.851 --> 01:04:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2598
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Flying five hours in a plane over the ocean doesn't really seem like American to</v>

2599
01:04:09.511 --> 01:04:10.344
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2600
01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.490
<v Speaker 2>although I love Hawaii.</v>

2601
01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2602
01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:15.180
<v Speaker 2>but the difference between that and September 11th September 11th like,</v>

2603
01:04:15.181 --> 01:04:15.391
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2604
01:04:15.391 --> 01:04:19.650
<v Speaker 2>this is actually happening in Ameritech more things happening in America and we</v>

2605
01:04:19.651 --> 01:04:21.680
<v Speaker 2>think it's a direct result of mismanagement.</v>

2606
01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:22.590
<v Speaker 2>Miss Government,</v>

2607
01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:23.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2608
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.113
<v Speaker 2>corruption,</v>

2609
01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:24.953
<v Speaker 2>what have you,</v>

2610
01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.760
<v Speaker 2>and people die and you know,</v>

2611
01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Chicago is blown off the face of the map.</v>

2612
01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Some ugly shit could go down,</v>

2613
01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:31.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2614
01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:31.611
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2615
01:04:31.611 --> 01:04:32.151
<v Speaker 2>but that you,</v>

2616
01:04:32.151 --> 01:04:32.370
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2617
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:34.290
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about like a post apocalyptic,</v>

2618
01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.980
<v Speaker 2>you know like a blade runner type of like that's not,</v>

2619
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:39.510
<v Speaker 2>that's not something that we're,</v>

2620
01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:40.100
<v Speaker 2>we're separate.</v>

2621
01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:40.891
<v Speaker 2>We're steps away from,</v>

2622
01:04:40.891 --> 01:04:42.900
<v Speaker 2>there are several steps away if we are several steps,</v>

2623
01:04:42.901 --> 01:04:45.750
<v Speaker 2>but that's one of the reasons why people will never give up their fucking guns.</v>

2624
01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:46.630
<v Speaker 2>It's one,</v>

2625
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:49.980
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why people think like this shit could always happen.</v>

2626
01:04:49.981 --> 01:04:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I want to be locked and loaded with a bunch of water in my basement.</v>

2627
01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Some potatoes,</v>

2628
01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:56.410
<v Speaker 2>standby for tags,</v>

2629
01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:57.383
<v Speaker 2>bags</v>

2630
01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:00.600
<v Speaker 2>with the thing where I can clean my urine so I can drink it.</v>

2631
01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:01.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2632
01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Super Britta filter.</v>

2633
01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.421
<v Speaker 2>When is that?</v>

2634
01:05:03.421 --> 01:05:04.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not,</v>

2635
01:05:04.261 --> 01:05:05.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to take away people's guns away,</v>

2636
01:05:05.551 --> 01:05:09.570
<v Speaker 2>but when has a cache of guns stop the government from taking anybody down if</v>

2637
01:05:09.571 --> 01:05:10.500
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to take them down?</v>

2638
01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:11.580
<v Speaker 2>It depends.</v>

2639
01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Depends on how many guns and how many people,</v>

2640
01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:14.730
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying we haven't seen it happen.</v>

2641
01:05:14.731 --> 01:05:15.540
<v Speaker 2>You know when they're,</v>

2642
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.200
<v Speaker 2>when they decide to come get you,</v>

2643
01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.760
<v Speaker 2>you know Ruby Ridge</v>

2644
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:19.541
<v Speaker 1>or Waco,</v>

2645
01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>they go get the tank with the fire.</v>

2646
01:05:20.951 --> 01:05:23.080
<v Speaker 1>That'll stop the semi automatic machine guns.</v>

2647
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't trying to take down the government.</v>

2648
01:05:24.761 --> 01:05:26.260
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to bang everybody's pay,</v>

2649
01:05:26.330 --> 01:05:26.801
<v Speaker 1>but as I'm saying,</v>

2650
01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:27.171
<v Speaker 1>when they're like,</v>

2651
01:05:27.171 --> 01:05:28.200
<v Speaker 1>when they're and that they,</v>

2652
01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.310
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't even doing things that were necessarily,</v>

2653
01:05:30.311 --> 01:05:31.210
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't killing people in,</v>

2654
01:05:31.211 --> 01:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>they went,</v>

2655
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.340
<v Speaker 1>they were just like get the tank with the fire.</v>

2656
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:34.210
<v Speaker 1>That'll settle this,</v>

2657
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.110
<v Speaker 1>that'll take care of this.</v>

2658
01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:35.840
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

2659
01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>you can't fence in your town and then like have tanks and guns and ammo and the</v>

2660
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:44.260
<v Speaker 1>government's like that seems a little too much like a small country.</v>

2661
01:05:44.261 --> 01:05:45.094
<v Speaker 1>You fuck.</v>

2662
01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2663
01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:49.270
<v Speaker 1>we know we're not a bad and I'm not for the government ruling everything.</v>

2664
01:05:49.271 --> 01:05:52.840
<v Speaker 1>I just think that the thing that you see in Egypt and in the Ukraine is that if</v>

2665
01:05:52.841 --> 01:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>people storm the streets,</v>

2666
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter how many tanks do you have.</v>

2667
01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:59.530
<v Speaker 1>People just go and I always say that like the problem with American protest is</v>

2668
01:05:59.531 --> 01:06:01.570
<v Speaker 1>they have an end time and it's posted on Facebook.</v>

2669
01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>We are going to be in the streets until five 30 right.</v>

2670
01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:05.591
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in the Ukraine,</v>

2671
01:06:05.591 --> 01:06:05.951
<v Speaker 1>in Egypt,</v>

2672
01:06:05.951 --> 01:06:06.101
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2673
01:06:06.101 --> 01:06:06.191
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2674
01:06:06.191 --> 01:06:07.060
<v Speaker 1>we're just going to stay.</v>

2675
01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:08.500
<v Speaker 1>We're just not going anywhere.</v>

2676
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:10.300
<v Speaker 1>And I know that Americans have that.</v>

2677
01:06:10.301 --> 01:06:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2678
01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:11.890
<v Speaker 1>have that kind of follow through.</v>

2679
01:06:11.891 --> 01:06:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Eventually you're like,</v>

2680
01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to get home and watch some Netflix is on tonight and I'm going to order</v>

2681
01:06:17.081 --> 01:06:17.801
<v Speaker 1>take out.</v>

2682
01:06:17.801 --> 01:06:17.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2683
01:06:17.971 --> 01:06:18.231
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2684
01:06:18.231 --> 01:06:18.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2685
01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:19.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2686
01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I got to pick up my kid from soccer practice.</v>

2687
01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:23.020
<v Speaker 1>The fucking baby shit man.</v>

2688
01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:23.883
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

2689
01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.400
<v Speaker 1>isn't that the goal of being an American and being allowed to be as soft as baby</v>

2690
01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:27.671
<v Speaker 1>shit?</v>

2691
01:06:27.671 --> 01:06:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the why we,</v>

2692
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:30.160
<v Speaker 1>why people struggle to get here?</v>

2693
01:06:30.161 --> 01:06:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Why kids are streaming across the border?</v>

2694
01:06:31.451 --> 01:06:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Because it's hard living here.</v>

2695
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:36.970
<v Speaker 1>So why we got a two five terrorism over there.</v>

2696
01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.980
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't come over here.</v>

2697
01:06:39.070 --> 01:06:43.120
<v Speaker 1>So you can avoid your Chinese food and enjoy your soccer practice.</v>

2698
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2699
01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:44.371
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2700
01:06:44.371 --> 01:06:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2701
01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:45.580
<v Speaker 1>That's why we need guns.</v>

2702
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:46.440
<v Speaker 1>That's why we need to get,</v>

2703
01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.250
<v Speaker 1>we got to understand the second amendment.</v>

2704
01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:49.111
<v Speaker 1>Second Amendment.</v>

2705
01:06:49.111 --> 01:06:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2706
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:50.381
<v Speaker 1>I'll show it to you.</v>

2707
01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:54.080
<v Speaker 1>It was written on the animal skins collaborate here.</v>

2708
01:06:54.081 --> 01:06:54.914
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2709
01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.500
<v Speaker 1>but God wrote the second amendment.</v>

2710
01:06:56.501 --> 01:06:57.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's how that worked.</v>

2711
01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:01.090
<v Speaker 1>The shit was written in the 17 hundreds and everybody's clinging to it.</v>

2712
01:07:01.091 --> 01:07:04.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the hilarious thing about the constitution in general that is written</v>

2713
01:07:04.481 --> 01:07:06.160
<v Speaker 1>like this is unconstitutional.</v>

2714
01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.553
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2715
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:08.110
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2716
01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:10.650
<v Speaker 1>The fucking constitution is old as shit.</v>

2717
01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:10.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2718
01:07:10.841 --> 01:07:12.040
<v Speaker 1>as I understand it is,</v>

2719
01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I was taught in a,</v>

2720
01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:17.050
<v Speaker 1>in a high school American history class when they wrote it,</v>

2721
01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:17.771
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

2722
01:07:17.771 --> 01:07:20.950
<v Speaker 1>this will just set the country up for about 20 years and then we'll come back</v>

2723
01:07:20.951 --> 01:07:22.220
<v Speaker 1>and look at this like,</v>

2724
01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:23.320
<v Speaker 1>this is just the,</v>

2725
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:24.730
<v Speaker 1>we are done with the British.</v>

2726
01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:25.870
<v Speaker 1>We've got to make sure they don't come back.</v>

2727
01:07:25.871 --> 01:07:27.940
<v Speaker 1>So we need militias just in case they show up again.</v>

2728
01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.480
<v Speaker 1>But this is just to get us started and it became sacrosanct.</v>

2729
01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:32.680
<v Speaker 1>It became like this is the,</v>

2730
01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:34.390
<v Speaker 1>it became another chapter of the Bible.</v>

2731
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:34.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2732
01:07:34.601 --> 01:07:36.190
<v Speaker 1>once the people who wrote it are dead,</v>

2733
01:07:36.191 --> 01:07:39.430
<v Speaker 1>you don't ever want to fuck with it because then it's like a religious doctrine.</v>

2734
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2735
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:42.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem is that it w religious doctrine,</v>

2736
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.920
<v Speaker 1>religious doctrines aren't religious doctrines.</v>

2737
01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.380
<v Speaker 1>They're all written by a dude named Jeff,</v>

2738
01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:47.921
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2739
01:07:47.921 --> 01:07:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm on somebody who was like,</v>

2740
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:49.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2741
01:07:49.901 --> 01:07:50.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2742
01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:50.561
<v Speaker 1>It's always like,</v>

2743
01:07:50.561 --> 01:07:51.394
<v Speaker 1>I just want to,</v>

2744
01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:52.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2745
01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:53.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2746
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:54.041
<v Speaker 1>it's like Chris Rock Creek,</v>

2747
01:07:54.041 --> 01:07:54.461
<v Speaker 1>Chris Rock,</v>

2748
01:07:54.461 --> 01:07:54.881
<v Speaker 1>bit about it.</v>

2749
01:07:54.881 --> 01:07:55.331
<v Speaker 1>Like people,</v>

2750
01:07:55.331 --> 01:07:56.081
<v Speaker 1>like people said,</v>

2751
01:07:56.081 --> 01:07:58.000
<v Speaker 1>God said it because if you say,</v>

2752
01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:58.661
<v Speaker 1>I said it,</v>

2753
01:07:58.661 --> 01:07:59.494
<v Speaker 1>people don't listen,</v>

2754
01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:00.310
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>

2755
01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:00.730
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2756
01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:01.600
<v Speaker 1>pork will kill you.</v>

2757
01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:02.711
<v Speaker 1>They don't listen.</v>

2758
01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:03.281
<v Speaker 1>God said,</v>

2759
01:08:03.281 --> 01:08:03.851
<v Speaker 1>portal key.</v>

2760
01:08:03.851 --> 01:08:04.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2761
01:08:04.091 --> 01:08:04.930
<v Speaker 1>we'll stop eating pork.</v>

2762
01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2763
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:07.990
<v Speaker 1>people like to be told they have authority and I'm not.</v>

2764
01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:08.531
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

2765
01:08:08.531 --> 01:08:09.520
<v Speaker 1>this is somebody who's not.</v>

2766
01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2767
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an,</v>

2768
01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an atheist.</v>

2769
01:08:12.371 --> 01:08:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a,</v>

2770
01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not anti,</v>

2771
01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:15.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not anti religion.</v>

2772
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>I'd certainly think religion done a lot of shitty things,</v>

2773
01:08:16.881 --> 01:08:18.320
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not sitting here as an atheist going,</v>

2774
01:08:18.321 --> 01:08:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in any of it.</v>

2775
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.690
<v Speaker 1>What are you,</v>

2776
01:08:20.690 --> 01:08:21.740
<v Speaker 1>if you're not an atheist,</v>

2777
01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.330
<v Speaker 1>do you consider yourself an agnostic?</v>

2778
01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.140
<v Speaker 1>Are you religious?</v>

2779
01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:24.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2780
01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:24.771
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really,</v>

2781
01:08:24.771 --> 01:08:24.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2782
01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I grew up Christian.</v>

2783
01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

2784
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:28.610
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I come from a Christian base.</v>

2785
01:08:28.611 --> 01:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I like I was black church Methodist church,</v>

2786
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Baptist church,</v>

2787
01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:34.580
<v Speaker 1>so I can't help but retreat to that.</v>

2788
01:08:34.581 --> 01:08:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when the shit hits the fan could,</v>

2789
01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2790
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:38.150
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus help like,</v>

2791
01:08:38.151 --> 01:08:39.890
<v Speaker 1>but I don't expect them to walk through the door,</v>

2792
01:08:39.891 --> 01:08:40.370
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2793
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not,</v>

2794
01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that there is a guy in heaven looking down on me,</v>

2795
01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.710
<v Speaker 1>but I do like to think of the universe as being in a place where it,</v>

2796
01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.521
<v Speaker 1>where if you,</v>

2797
01:08:49.521 --> 01:08:52.760
<v Speaker 1>if you live a good life and have ordered that things will work out for you.</v>

2798
01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2799
01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:55.790
<v Speaker 1>and certainly I will retreat to,</v>

2800
01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:56.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2801
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:58.070
<v Speaker 1>I like to think that I just,</v>

2802
01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.690
<v Speaker 1>it makes me feel comforted to go,</v>

2803
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:00.920
<v Speaker 1>thanks God,</v>

2804
01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.020
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going before we get started,</v>

2805
01:09:03.021 --> 01:09:03.800
<v Speaker 1>let's have a prayer.</v>

2806
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.633
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2807
01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:05.810
<v Speaker 1>It's culturally,</v>

2808
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 1>God has been a cultured,</v>

2809
01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:11.090
<v Speaker 1>I've been in like culture with God and it doesn't,</v>

2810
01:09:11.091 --> 01:09:12.770
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to have worked out,</v>

2811
01:09:12.771 --> 01:09:13.910
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to go to church.</v>

2812
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.811
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

2813
01:09:14.811 --> 01:09:17.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel a mild form of Christianity.</v>

2814
01:09:17.190 --> 01:09:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I have a mom like it's like it's a,</v>

2815
01:09:20.361 --> 01:09:22.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like a piece that you don't need to take Valtrex for.</v>

2816
01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:23.390
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what it is.</v>

2817
01:09:23.391 --> 01:09:25.750
<v Speaker 1>I have tried just fine.</v>

2818
01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:26.990
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't usually hurt anybody.</v>

2819
01:09:26.991 --> 01:09:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I let everybody know it's just,</v>

2820
01:09:28.850 --> 01:09:32.420
<v Speaker 1>and I only say that because I feel like I can have the atheism discussion and</v>

2821
01:09:32.421 --> 01:09:34.460
<v Speaker 1>not feel threatened by uh,</v>

2822
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:36.870
<v Speaker 1>who have to tell me there's not a god cause it breaks my whole,</v>

2823
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:37.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2824
01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.560
<v Speaker 1>this is my own in the same way that some people,</v>

2825
01:09:39.561 --> 01:09:40.880
<v Speaker 1>their god is good,</v>

2826
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2827
01:09:41.361 --> 01:09:42.194
<v Speaker 1>game of Thrones,</v>

2828
01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.610
<v Speaker 1>they like think that's the thing,</v>

2829
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:44.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2830
01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:44.600
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2831
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.290
<v Speaker 1>we all of us have gods that we've defined is like I'm living my life.</v>

2832
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Comicon is religion for people.</v>

2833
01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:51.460
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2834
01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:52.101
<v Speaker 1>but we somehow,</v>

2835
01:09:52.101 --> 01:09:55.220
<v Speaker 1>if you actually say the really do don't you just think as a gathering,</v>

2836
01:09:55.221 --> 01:09:56.210
<v Speaker 1>a fun gathering.</v>

2837
01:09:56.211 --> 01:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2838
01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:58.250
<v Speaker 1>but that's what religion started out as.</v>

2839
01:09:58.251 --> 01:09:58.760
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

2840
01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.090
<v Speaker 1>it was a way to centralize the community and get people on the same page about</v>

2841
01:10:02.091 --> 01:10:02.630
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2842
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:03.770
<v Speaker 1>And some of those things are moral.</v>

2843
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:04.490
<v Speaker 1>And I get,</v>

2844
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:05.690
<v Speaker 1>have you been to comic con?</v>

2845
01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:06.380
<v Speaker 1>He must've.</v>

2846
01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I've been outside of comicon.</v>

2847
01:10:08.391 --> 01:10:09.620
<v Speaker 1>I've never gone into comic.</v>

2848
01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:10.700
<v Speaker 1>If you went into comic con,</v>

2849
01:10:10.701 --> 01:10:11.720
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't ask this question.</v>

2850
01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:12.201
<v Speaker 1>I went there,</v>

2851
01:10:12.201 --> 01:10:12.621
<v Speaker 1>I went in there.</v>

2852
01:10:12.621 --> 01:10:13.021
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2853
01:10:13.021 --> 01:10:14.210
<v Speaker 1>it's for real like people,</v>

2854
01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:15.740
<v Speaker 1>this is like people's lives,</v>

2855
01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:16.640
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2856
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Because they get the freedom to have fun and be a freak because like most of the</v>

2857
01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:25.220
<v Speaker 1>time society frowns upon you dressing like an anime character.</v>

2858
01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time you can't be a furry,</v>

2859
01:10:27.171 --> 01:10:28.360
<v Speaker 1>you can't be iron man.</v>

2860
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:28.731
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

2861
01:10:28.731 --> 01:10:31.850
<v Speaker 1>you can't just be there and be hanging out with people having a good time.</v>

2862
01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:32.391
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2863
01:10:32.391 --> 01:10:33.051
<v Speaker 1>I think it is that,</v>

2864
01:10:33.051 --> 01:10:34.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's also those people,</v>

2865
01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:34.760
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2866
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.010
<v Speaker 1>they go there because that's the place where they're permitted to have it,</v>

2867
01:10:37.011 --> 01:10:38.450
<v Speaker 1>but they're living at the whole year.</v>

2868
01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they're just just like a furry in their house,</v>

2869
01:10:40.851 --> 01:10:41.510
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2870
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:42.470
<v Speaker 1>But then that's where they go.</v>

2871
01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:43.011
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2872
01:10:43.011 --> 01:10:43.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2873
01:10:43.221 --> 01:10:43.821
<v Speaker 1>it's like Christmas,</v>

2874
01:10:43.821 --> 01:10:46.760
<v Speaker 1>we're allowed to hang the lights and do all the shit that and it's just fun.</v>

2875
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:48.670
<v Speaker 1>But then some people also carried the,</v>

2876
01:10:48.671 --> 01:10:49.700
<v Speaker 1>have a cross on their wall.</v>

2877
01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:50.240
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2878
01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's much difference ultimately between a Spiderman poster on</v>

2879
01:10:53.331 --> 01:10:53.870
<v Speaker 1>your wall.</v>

2880
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:55.070
<v Speaker 1>If then across on your wall,</v>

2881
01:10:55.071 --> 01:10:56.780
<v Speaker 1>if that's the thing that you're focused on,</v>

2882
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:57.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2883
01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.550
<v Speaker 1>that'd be hilarious.</v>

2884
01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I Spiderman is your God.</v>

2885
01:11:00.351 --> 01:11:01.184
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2886
01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:02.871
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly,</v>

2887
01:11:02.871 --> 01:11:04.310
<v Speaker 1>and I live in San Francisco where people,</v>

2888
01:11:04.311 --> 01:11:08.360
<v Speaker 1>I've lived as her people are hyperfocused about their version of their life.</v>

2889
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:08.841
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2890
01:11:08.841 --> 01:11:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I want to live my life this way.</v>

2891
01:11:10.011 --> 01:11:11.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to this coffee shop and I want to,</v>

2892
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.080
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2893
01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:13.470
<v Speaker 1>and I go to this bar and I,</v>

2894
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:17.140
<v Speaker 1>and I do leather things on the weekend and I go to the Folsom street fair and</v>

2895
01:11:17.141 --> 01:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2896
01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.271
<v Speaker 1>and that to me,</v>

2897
01:11:18.271 --> 01:11:19.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's your religion.</v>

2898
01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.100
<v Speaker 1>You than he,</v>

2899
01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:22.680
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that makes you feel better about the world and that's how you</v>

2900
01:11:22.681 --> 01:11:23.760
<v Speaker 1>put order in the world.</v>

2901
01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:24.953
<v Speaker 1>But you're not,</v>

2902
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:25.291
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>

2903
01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:26.250
<v Speaker 1>God may be,</v>

2904
01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:27.443
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2905
01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:27.931
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2906
01:11:27.931 --> 01:11:28.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2907
01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:31.470
<v Speaker 1>that I'm going to live the best gay lifestyle I have or that I'm going to be the</v>

2908
01:11:31.471 --> 01:11:32.100
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>

2909
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:32.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2910
01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:32.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2911
01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:33.210
<v Speaker 1>There's all,</v>

2912
01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:34.410
<v Speaker 1>we all have gods,</v>

2913
01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:36.330
<v Speaker 1>we just don't want to put that word on them.</v>

2914
01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:37.140
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

2915
01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:37.951
<v Speaker 1>my God is actually,</v>

2916
01:11:37.951 --> 01:11:40.080
<v Speaker 1>I put the word God in there cause I don't want to be a hypocrite and be like,</v>

2917
01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2918
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.990
<v Speaker 1>basically when I went and I met my wife,</v>

2919
01:11:42.991 --> 01:11:45.340
<v Speaker 1>she was a religious studies major.</v>

2920
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:46.380
<v Speaker 1>She was in graduate school for that.</v>

2921
01:11:46.381 --> 01:11:46.681
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2922
01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I did the thing that everybody says,</v>

2923
01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:48.781
<v Speaker 1>I'm not religious,</v>

2924
01:11:48.781 --> 01:11:49.381
<v Speaker 1>I'm spiritual.</v>

2925
01:11:49.381 --> 01:11:49.681
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2926
01:11:49.681 --> 01:11:50.514
<v Speaker 1>that's full of Shit,</v>

2927
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2928
01:11:50.961 --> 01:11:51.540
<v Speaker 1>and take us,</v>

2929
01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:51.901
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

2930
01:11:51.901 --> 01:11:52.860
<v Speaker 1>what do you believe?</v>

2931
01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:53.963
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2932
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I guess I believe in God.</v>

2933
01:11:55.171 --> 01:11:56.940
<v Speaker 1>But it's like if you say that people start to get quiet,</v>

2934
01:11:56.941 --> 01:11:58.230
<v Speaker 1>like you guys are getting quiet right now.</v>

2935
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm letting you talk.</v>

2936
01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:00.131
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2937
01:12:00.131 --> 01:12:00.271
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2938
01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:00.481
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2939
01:12:00.481 --> 01:12:01.291
<v Speaker 1>I'm just fucking around.</v>

2940
01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:01.740
<v Speaker 1>But yes,</v>

2941
01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:02.690
<v Speaker 1>don't see the,</v>

2942
01:12:02.691 --> 01:12:03.021
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2943
01:12:03.021 --> 01:12:05.370
<v Speaker 1>the connection between Spiderman and God.</v>

2944
01:12:05.371 --> 01:12:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I think Spiderman is something you enjoy.</v>

2945
01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:11.430
<v Speaker 1>God is something you believe in that doesn't necessarily have any basis,</v>

2946
01:12:11.431 --> 01:12:12.061
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

2947
01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.310
<v Speaker 1>or in provable,</v>

2948
01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2949
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.680
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2950
01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.980
<v Speaker 1>you can't prove the existence of God.</v>

2951
01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:17.640
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

2952
01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.211
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing,</v>

2953
01:12:18.211 --> 01:12:21.660
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that you can point to in science that says,</v>

2954
01:12:21.661 --> 01:12:22.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2955
01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:23.490
<v Speaker 1>we can't explain this.</v>

2956
01:12:23.491 --> 01:12:25.860
<v Speaker 1>We're pretty sure that what this is is God's work.</v>

2957
01:12:25.861 --> 01:12:27.180
<v Speaker 1>But there's certainly,</v>

2958
01:12:27.181 --> 01:12:27.650
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2959
01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:30.570
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing and I feel very comfortable and not because I'm not trying to</v>

2960
01:12:30.571 --> 01:12:31.470
<v Speaker 1>convince you guys,</v>

2961
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I feel very comfortable and not being able to approve the thing that is that I</v>

2962
01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:36.080
<v Speaker 1>sort of walk around with it.</v>

2963
01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:36.631
<v Speaker 1>But listen,</v>

2964
01:12:36.631 --> 01:12:37.261
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to,</v>

2965
01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:37.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2966
01:12:37.411 --> 01:12:38.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a framework for,</v>

2967
01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:39.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2968
01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:40.890
<v Speaker 1>moral judgments.</v>

2969
01:12:40.891 --> 01:12:43.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a framework for discipline.</v>

2970
01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:47.270
<v Speaker 1>It can give you sort of a path to lead your life in a positive manner.</v>

2971
01:12:47.271 --> 01:12:48.720
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with religion,</v>

2972
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:50.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's not iron man.</v>

2973
01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:51.180
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2974
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:51.990
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>

2975
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I believe that we all know that there are things that we put in our,</v>

2976
01:12:55.230 --> 01:12:55.661
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>

2977
01:12:55.661 --> 01:12:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

2978
01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.190
<v Speaker 1>this isn't even criticize them,</v>

2979
01:12:57.191 --> 01:13:00.150
<v Speaker 1>it's just there are things that people put in their life like I don't believe in</v>

2980
01:13:00.151 --> 01:13:00.511
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

2981
01:13:00.511 --> 01:13:01.470
<v Speaker 1>And then you see that they spent,</v>

2982
01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.353
<v Speaker 1>what will,</v>

2983
01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:04.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're spending the most time doing that you feel like is making you a</v>

2984
01:13:04.801 --> 01:13:05.634
<v Speaker 1>better person.</v>

2985
01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:06.090
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>

2986
01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:06.510
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2987
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:07.710
<v Speaker 1>that's your God.</v>

2988
01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:08.221
<v Speaker 1>That's your,</v>

2989
01:13:08.221 --> 01:13:09.150
<v Speaker 1>that's your religion.</v>

2990
01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:10.980
<v Speaker 1>That's we are inventing our own religion.</v>

2991
01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:11.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2992
01:13:11.311 --> 01:13:12.600
<v Speaker 1>religion maybe.</v>

2993
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2994
01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:13.351
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2995
01:13:13.351 --> 01:13:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Like ideologies,</v>

2996
01:13:14.611 --> 01:13:15.331
<v Speaker 1>religions.</v>

2997
01:13:15.331 --> 01:13:16.100
<v Speaker 1>They're very similar.</v>

2998
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2999
01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I feel like your religion is PR.</v>

3000
01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:19.231
<v Speaker 1>You got a little,</v>

3001
01:13:19.231 --> 01:13:21.210
<v Speaker 1>it may religion happening to know like where thanks,</v>

3002
01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.440
<v Speaker 1>I go to the gym,</v>

3003
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:23.400
<v Speaker 1>I work out,</v>

3004
01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm bonding.</v>

3005
01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:25.170
<v Speaker 1>This is my community.</v>

3006
01:13:25.171 --> 01:13:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I bond with these people.</v>

3007
01:13:26.251 --> 01:13:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I feel better because I come here.</v>

3008
01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:31.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a code of honor here and a code of ethics that if somebody violates,</v>

3009
01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:33.880
<v Speaker 1>we talked to that person about it or if it that's that's,</v>

3010
01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.630
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not trying to make anybody feel,</v>

3011
01:13:36.710 --> 01:13:37.670
<v Speaker 1>this is just my belief.</v>

3012
01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to say it,</v>

3013
01:13:39.011 --> 01:13:41.820
<v Speaker 1>just we you have that life that this is how I live my life and this is how I</v>

3014
01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:42.654
<v Speaker 1>want to live my life.</v>

3015
01:13:42.690 --> 01:13:46.600
<v Speaker 1>It's just we've taken the God thing out of it because God cause people fuck the</v>

3016
01:13:46.601 --> 01:13:46.980
<v Speaker 1>gut.</v>

3017
01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.020
<v Speaker 1>People treated that turf,</v>

3018
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:49.950
<v Speaker 1>turned that into a bed and turned into a shouting thing.</v>

3019
01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:50.521
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3020
01:13:50.521 --> 01:13:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

3021
01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.550
<v Speaker 1>I will make fun of boarding and Christians all day long.</v>

3022
01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to say that that's the way to do it,</v>

3023
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:56.431
<v Speaker 1>but for me,</v>

3024
01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:58.490
<v Speaker 1>I think because I grew up that way in the,</v>

3025
01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:00.210
<v Speaker 1>like there was a lot of church around my life.</v>

3026
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I projected the church.</v>

3027
01:14:01.501 --> 01:14:02.340
<v Speaker 1>But I also would like to,</v>

3028
01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:03.240
<v Speaker 1>if I'm,</v>

3029
01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.830
<v Speaker 1>if I'm running for the bus and I get it,</v>

3030
01:14:04.831 --> 01:14:05.664
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they go,</v>

3031
01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:06.071
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3032
01:14:06.071 --> 01:14:06.870
<v Speaker 1>thank God.</v>

3033
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:07.660
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know.</v>

3034
01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:08.191
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3035
01:14:08.191 --> 01:14:08.341
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3036
01:14:08.341 --> 01:14:08.850
<v Speaker 1>and I just,</v>

3037
01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:09.683
<v Speaker 1>and I know that I'm,</v>

3038
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:11.040
<v Speaker 1>but I don't expect that I'd be like,</v>

3039
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I got you dog.</v>

3040
01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:12.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3041
01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't expect to see the guy,</v>

3042
01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3043
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:15.063
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

3044
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just,</v>

3045
01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:16.421
<v Speaker 1>it's in me,</v>

3046
01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:17.231
<v Speaker 1>it's a part of my,</v>

3047
01:14:17.231 --> 01:14:17.590
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

3048
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:20.230
<v Speaker 1>it's part of my ethnicity is black religion.</v>

3049
01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:21.760
<v Speaker 1>It can be empowering,</v>

3050
01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:22.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3051
01:14:22.151 --> 01:14:22.421
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

3052
01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:23.470
<v Speaker 1>to have a belief.</v>

3053
01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.120
<v Speaker 1>And that belief doesn't necessarily have to be even based on fact in order for</v>

3054
01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:28.990
<v Speaker 1>it to benefit you.</v>

3055
01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:29.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3056
01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:29.680
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3057
01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem is,</v>

3058
01:14:31.331 --> 01:14:32.164
<v Speaker 1>is that if you go,</v>

3059
01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:33.340
<v Speaker 1>this is what I believe,</v>

3060
01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:35.110
<v Speaker 1>and I'm gonna sit here until you two guys believe it.</v>

3061
01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:35.441
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3062
01:14:35.441 --> 01:14:36.160
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

3063
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:36.431
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3064
01:14:36.431 --> 01:14:36.940
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

3065
01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I can't disprove it either.</v>

3066
01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:42.280
<v Speaker 1>The reality is I've seen way more fucked up shit doing psychedelic drugs and</v>

3067
01:14:42.281 --> 01:14:44.650
<v Speaker 1>anybody has ever described in the Bible,</v>

3068
01:14:44.970 --> 01:14:45.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3069
01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:50.260
<v Speaker 1>if you go to heaven and it's just a guy with a harp and angels and Saint Peter's</v>

3070
01:14:51.341 --> 01:14:53.890
<v Speaker 1>really at the pearly gates and the floor's made out of clouds.</v>

3071
01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3072
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:58.480
<v Speaker 1>like that would be so normal in comparison to like a DMT trip.</v>

3073
01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Like that shit would be like pretty mundane.</v>

3074
01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.620
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like people talk about proof all the time.</v>

3075
01:15:02.650 --> 01:15:04.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why this phone fucking works,</v>

3076
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:05.650
<v Speaker 1>but they could figure that out.</v>

3077
01:15:05.690 --> 01:15:06.311
<v Speaker 1>They could figure it out.</v>

3078
01:15:06.311 --> 01:15:07.540
<v Speaker 1>I need to talk to someone educated,</v>

3079
01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.330
<v Speaker 1>but nobody's gonna explain it to me in a way that I could take it apart and</v>

3080
01:15:10.331 --> 01:15:11.200
<v Speaker 1>putting it back together.</v>

3081
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:12.070
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3082
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.490
<v Speaker 1>They could,</v>

3083
01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:13.450
<v Speaker 1>they would just take a long,</v>

3084
01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:14.531
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I'm saying.</v>

3085
01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:15.250
<v Speaker 1>But I don't care.</v>

3086
01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to know what I'm saying.</v>

3087
01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:18.371
<v Speaker 1>I trusted,</v>

3088
01:15:18.371 --> 01:15:19.030
<v Speaker 1>there's people,</v>

3089
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:22.330
<v Speaker 1>there's children in China who know what they're doing and they put the phone</v>

3090
01:15:22.331 --> 01:15:22.930
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3091
01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:26.740
<v Speaker 1>But if you wanted to chase that down to the very origins of the first seed that</v>

3092
01:15:26.741 --> 01:15:27.910
<v Speaker 1>makes the first phone,</v>

3093
01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.180
<v Speaker 1>you could do that and I,</v>

3094
01:15:29.181 --> 01:15:29.861
<v Speaker 1>and the same way,</v>

3095
01:15:29.861 --> 01:15:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't have interest in doing that.</v>

3096
01:15:30.941 --> 01:15:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't have interest in convincing anybody else about my version of God.</v>

3097
01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Like as I say on stage,</v>

3098
01:15:35.051 --> 01:15:35.651
<v Speaker 1>when I say God,</v>

3099
01:15:35.651 --> 01:15:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I picture a really old Denzel Washington with dreadlocks,</v>

3100
01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.540
<v Speaker 1>but just that's how it is in my head.</v>

3101
01:15:40.541 --> 01:15:41.440
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel about it.</v>

3102
01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:42.820
<v Speaker 1>What about a,</v>

3103
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.760
<v Speaker 1>didn't Morgan Freeman play God and move in a Prince George?</v>

3104
01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:47.680
<v Speaker 1>This has been a few old dude.</v>

3105
01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3106
01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:48.371
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3107
01:15:48.371 --> 01:15:48.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3108
01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:49.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3109
01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:49.211
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3110
01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:49.361
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3111
01:15:49.361 --> 01:15:51.070
<v Speaker 1>mine is specifically Denzel Washington.</v>

3112
01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.530
<v Speaker 1>That's specifically why Denzel,</v>

3113
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:55.050
<v Speaker 1>he's like sort of,</v>

3114
01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:55.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3115
01:15:55.501 --> 01:15:56.300
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine taught me,</v>

3116
01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:57.700
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of like a surrogate dad,</v>

3117
01:15:57.730 --> 01:15:58.660
<v Speaker 1>like Denzel Washington.</v>

3118
01:15:58.960 --> 01:15:59.793
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him,</v>

3119
01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:00.790
<v Speaker 1>but in the movies,</v>

3120
01:16:00.791 --> 01:16:03.160
<v Speaker 1>there was a period of my life where like I felt like Denzel was,</v>

3121
01:16:03.161 --> 01:16:04.060
<v Speaker 1>it helped me figure it out.</v>

3122
01:16:04.061 --> 01:16:04.600
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

3123
01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:08.440
<v Speaker 1>he's the last black actor in Hollywood who is sort of carrying the baton for</v>

3124
01:16:08.441 --> 01:16:09.730
<v Speaker 1>this as how to be a black man.</v>

3125
01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:10.151
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

3126
01:16:10.151 --> 01:16:13.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying and that's an important thing to have in the black community,</v>

3127
01:16:13.601 --> 01:16:14.381
<v Speaker 1>especially when you grow up.</v>

3128
01:16:14.381 --> 01:16:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Like I have known who my dad is.</v>

3129
01:16:16.031 --> 01:16:18.100
<v Speaker 1>I've met him several times and I'm fucking around.</v>

3130
01:16:18.101 --> 01:16:19.660
<v Speaker 1>I'd know when I used to visit in the summer,</v>

3131
01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.900
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't grow up with a deal with my dad in the house.</v>

3132
01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:27.280
<v Speaker 1>And so I found surrogate dads and places in entertainment who I felt like this</v>

3133
01:16:27.281 --> 01:16:31.570
<v Speaker 1>is a person that she tried to be like Bruce Lee was a surrogate dad of mine.</v>

3134
01:16:31.571 --> 01:16:31.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3135
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:32.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3136
01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:32.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3137
01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.140
<v Speaker 1>that just showed me that again,</v>

3138
01:16:34.210 --> 01:16:37.990
<v Speaker 1>helping me learn a moral code and giving me an example of how to be an adult and</v>

3139
01:16:37.991 --> 01:16:38.824
<v Speaker 1>how to be a man.</v>

3140
01:16:39.010 --> 01:16:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3141
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I had the same,</v>

3142
01:16:40.690 --> 01:16:43.240
<v Speaker 1>I had a martial arts instructor that did something for me.</v>

3143
01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I did martial arts instructor who did it for me.</v>

3144
01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:50.170
<v Speaker 1>There's this thing about movies and like having someone who may be even as an</v>

3145
01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:54.760
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic depiction of a human being,</v>

3146
01:16:54.761 --> 01:16:58.060
<v Speaker 1>like so moral and ethical and powerful and strong,</v>

3147
01:16:58.061 --> 01:17:00.250
<v Speaker 1>but that that can be empowering.</v>

3148
01:17:00.251 --> 01:17:02.140
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be like Denzel Washington,</v>

3149
01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.450
<v Speaker 1>you want to get some more coffee?</v>

3150
01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.130
<v Speaker 1>It makes them more tomorrow.</v>

3151
01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:06.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

3152
01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Let me just hop on a double stream.</v>

3153

<v Speaker 1>Do Special Magic coffees and got me,</v>

3154
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:10.873
<v Speaker 2>got me rolling.</v>

3155
01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:11.733
<v Speaker 2>It's good shit.</v>

3156
01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>

3157
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:19.330
<v Speaker 2>I never thought too much about racism and movies or thought about black people</v>

3158
01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:26.261
<v Speaker 2>being represented in movies until I went to see planet of the apes and a black</v>

3159
01:17:27.081 --> 01:17:29.180
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood and Philly and,</v>

3160
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:30.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3161
01:17:30.090 --> 01:17:30.923
<v Speaker 2>the first,</v>

3162
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:32.930
<v Speaker 2>the James Franco plant of the apes.</v>

3163
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:33.681
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3164
01:17:33.681 --> 01:17:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I was with my friend Tommy and his girlfriend Kate,</v>

3165
01:17:35.541 --> 01:17:38.390
<v Speaker 2>and we were in Philly for the UFC and a Friday nights,</v>

3166
01:17:38.391 --> 01:17:39.170
<v Speaker 2>the weigh ins.</v>

3167
01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:41.810
<v Speaker 2>So we do the way ends on Friday and then we had Friday night off.</v>

3168
01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:42.830
<v Speaker 2>And so we want to do,</v>

3169
01:17:42.831 --> 01:17:43.160
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3170
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.060
<v Speaker 2>plant of the apes is out,</v>

3171
01:17:44.061 --> 01:17:44.894
<v Speaker 2>let's go check it out.</v>

3172
01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:45.471
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3173
01:17:45.471 --> 01:17:45.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3174
01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:46.790
<v Speaker 2>we were in the hotel room.</v>

3175
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.790
<v Speaker 2>We got high as Jesus on the space shuttle.</v>

3176
01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:51.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3177
01:17:51.201 --> 01:17:52.760
<v Speaker 2>we went way too deep.</v>

3178
01:17:52.761 --> 01:17:53.720
<v Speaker 2>We went way too deep.</v>

3179
01:17:53.721 --> 01:17:58.070
<v Speaker 2>And then we went out to this movie theater and the closest movie theater was in</v>

3180
01:17:58.071 --> 01:17:59.510
<v Speaker 2>this all black neighborhood in Philly.</v>

3181
01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:00.640
<v Speaker 2>And so I mean,</v>

3182
01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:01.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean all blacks.</v>

3183
01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:04.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean we were the only fucking white,</v>

3184
01:18:04.071 --> 01:18:04.311
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3185
01:18:04.311 --> 01:18:05.121
<v Speaker 2>America's last few,</v>

3186
01:18:05.121 --> 01:18:05.954
<v Speaker 2>all of them,</v>

3187
01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:07.430
<v Speaker 2>but fun.</v>

3188
01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3189
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:09.050
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it was fun.</v>

3190
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:09.980
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>

3191
01:18:09.981 --> 01:18:10.400
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3192
01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.930
<v Speaker 2>when I was in that movie theater,</v>

3193
01:18:12.170 --> 01:18:15.080
<v Speaker 2>I was acutely aware of first of all that we were the only white people in there.</v>

3194
01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:20.140
<v Speaker 2>And I was also acutely aware that every fucking ad for every preview,</v>

3195
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:22.520
<v Speaker 2>every movie was white people.</v>

3196
01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.110
<v Speaker 2>It was all white people.</v>

3197
01:18:24.111 --> 01:18:24.711
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3198
01:18:24.711 --> 01:18:25.544
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

3199
01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.590
<v Speaker 2>But being in that position,</v>

3200
01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:31.370
<v Speaker 2>like having that perspective of being a white person and an all black movie</v>

3201
01:18:31.371 --> 01:18:31.521
<v Speaker 2>theater,</v>

3202
01:18:31.521 --> 01:18:31.880
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3203
01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:32.960
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

3204
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:38.270
<v Speaker 2>And being high as fuck made me super sensitive to it.</v>

3205
01:18:38.271 --> 01:18:42.770
<v Speaker 2>And there was only one white guy that interacted with a black guy and all the</v>

3206
01:18:42.771 --> 01:18:47.771
<v Speaker 2>previews and it was Jonah Hill and some fucking goofy ass movie about playing a</v>

3207
01:18:47.781 --> 01:18:52.640
<v Speaker 2>babysitter where he brings the kids and talk to this black doorman and he's</v>

3208
01:18:52.641 --> 01:18:57.641
<v Speaker 2>talking to a women this like really fucking depressing slang buddy.</v>

3209
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.943
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3210
01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:01.850
<v Speaker 2>it was so bad.</v>

3211
01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:02.560
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>

3212
01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:02.790
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3213
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:04.280
<v Speaker 2>the black guy says to him like,</v>

3214
01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:05.160
<v Speaker 2>you're a bad motherfucker.</v>

3215
01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:05.541
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3216
01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:06.050
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3217
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3218
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:08.510
<v Speaker 2>world is this taking place in.</v>

3219
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:09.560
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

3220
01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.030
<v Speaker 2>it was so bizarre.</v>

3221
01:19:11.031 --> 01:19:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Then plant of the apes place and everyone in the movie is white except the bad</v>

3222
01:19:15.681 --> 01:19:16.310
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

3223
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:19.170
<v Speaker 2>He's a black guy who fucking forces the,</v>

3224
01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:22.730
<v Speaker 2>the drugs to get into the monkeys and then the monkeys go loose and take over</v>

3225
01:19:22.731 --> 01:19:24.200
<v Speaker 2>the world and I'm like,</v>

3226
01:19:24.201 --> 01:19:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3227
01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 2>this is real shit.</v>

3228
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3229
01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:29.300
<v Speaker 2>everybody should get that high.</v>

3230
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:30.390
<v Speaker 2>Every white person can then hang,</v>

3231
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:32.920
<v Speaker 2>go see and go live in the world because that's what it does.</v>

3232
01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Everything you said is like,</v>

3233
01:19:34.821 --> 01:19:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3234
01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:35.420

01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Keeps it yet did nothing and not surprised.</v>

3237
01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.230
<v Speaker 2>Well also that scenario,</v>

3238
01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:41.450
<v Speaker 2>that particular scenario was unique.</v>

3239
01:19:41.451 --> 01:19:46.451
<v Speaker 2>It was very unique because it was like the perfect storm of shitty preview after</v>

3240
01:19:47.001 --> 01:19:49.550
<v Speaker 2>shitty preview and all of them with white people.</v>

3249
01:20:01.011 --> 01:20:02.150
<v Speaker 2>these previews waiting.</v>

3250
01:20:02.151 --> 01:20:04.220
<v Speaker 2>No one's laughing as they shouldn't.</v>

3251
01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.800
<v Speaker 2>There's the most depressing thing ever is when you go to the movies and the</v>

3252
01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 2>previous look like dog</v>

<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

3255
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:14.760
<v Speaker 1>we got to see that to see how Melissa Mccartney falls down.</v>

3256
01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:15.511
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're not laughing with it.</v>

3268
01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:29.760
<v Speaker 1>They're laughing at then San Francisco sometimes if people are like,</v>

3269
01:20:29.770 --> 01:20:30.421

01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:38.460
<v Speaker 1>That's when you know you're in a good neighborhood.</v>

3276
01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Good neighborhood to be in.</v>

3277
01:20:40.361 --> 01:20:42.000
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of laughter at the trailers.</v>

3278
01:20:43.730 --> 01:20:45.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the crowds I want to perform in the crowds.</v>

3279

3282
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Some shit like that.</v>

3283
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:56.521
<v Speaker 1>so for me,</v>

3285
01:20:56.521 --> 01:20:58.740
<v Speaker 1>I remember the time I off,</v>

3286
01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I remember where I just felt like you just,</v>

3287
01:21:00.331 --> 01:21:01.260
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just let me down.</v>

3288
01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:05.730
<v Speaker 1>It was Steve Martin in the movie with Queen Latifa and we're like some sort of</v>

3289
01:21:05.731 --> 01:21:08.760
<v Speaker 1>thing where she's the Blah Blah Blah and he's the bla bla bla.</v>

3292
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:15.630
<v Speaker 1>narrow version of white guy.</v>

3293
01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:16.650
<v Speaker 1>And in the middle of it,</v>

3294
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:17.783
<v Speaker 1>Steve Martin,</v>

3295
01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:22.200
<v Speaker 1>one of the greatest comedians of all time who has it was on the,</v>

3301
01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3302
01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3307
01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:38.640
<v Speaker 1>he's got a busy mind dollar house.</v>

3308
01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:39.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3309
01:21:39.421 --> 01:21:40.170
<v Speaker 1>that's the movie.</v>

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:41.640
<v Speaker 1>and see if you can find that video.</v>

3312
01:21:43.090 --> 01:21:45.870
<v Speaker 1>We got to see this video because it's so fucking bad.</v>

3313
01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:49.440
<v Speaker 1>He's like the wacky crazy babies and by the way,</v>

3314
01:21:49.441 --> 01:21:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Jonah Hill Fan.</v>

3315
01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I watched that it all black and movie theater stone to the Gills and I went,</v>

3316
01:21:59.281 --> 01:21:59.971
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3317
01:21:59.971 --> 01:22:04.620
<v Speaker 1>what a cartoonish buffoonish representation of black people and this is the only</v>

3318
01:22:04.621 --> 01:22:06.930
<v Speaker 1>one they get to see and the finding is is people will say,</v>

3319
01:22:06.931 --> 01:22:08.100
<v Speaker 1>why are black people are,</v>

3320
01:22:08.101 --> 01:22:09.390
<v Speaker 1>why are some black people so angry?</v>

3321
01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:10.440
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like we,</v>

3322
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.970
<v Speaker 1>they did the people in that theater you then,</v>

3323
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.690
<v Speaker 1>because we have to let shit wash over us for the rest will be angry all the time</v>

3324
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:18.600
<v Speaker 1>and we will be outwardly like flipping tables all the time.</v>

3325
01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:19.021
<v Speaker 1>If we don't,</v>

3326
01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:19.854
<v Speaker 1>if we don't sort of go,</v>

3327
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:21.360
<v Speaker 1>we just got to wait for planet of the apes.</v>

3328
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:22.740
<v Speaker 1>We just got to let this wash over us.</v>

3329
01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:23.370
<v Speaker 1>We can't turn.</v>

3330
01:22:23.370 --> 01:22:25.440
<v Speaker 1>We can't turn this into a change.org petition.</v>

3331
01:22:25.650 --> 01:22:26.580
<v Speaker 1>We just got to let this go.</v>

3332
01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:26.881
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3333
01:22:26.881 --> 01:22:27.241
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

3334
01:22:27.241 --> 01:22:27.870
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

3335
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:30.540
<v Speaker 1>you'd never dealing with things from a neutral point because you're dealing with</v>

3336
01:22:30.541 --> 01:22:31.171
<v Speaker 1>things from the,</v>

3337
01:22:31.171 --> 01:22:34.650
<v Speaker 1>the repercussions of all the other shit that you've seen already before that.</v>

3338
01:22:34.890 --> 01:22:37.290
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is is it has been stated by many people.</v>

3339
01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Is that in this country?</v>

3340
01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

3341
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:42.030
<v Speaker 1>The most people watching those trailers that you saw aren't going,</v>

3342
01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.410
<v Speaker 1>these are a bunch of white people in these trailers.</v>

3343
01:22:43.411 --> 01:22:43.660
<v Speaker 1>They're going,</v>

3344
01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:45.090
<v Speaker 1>those are a bunch of people in these trailers.</v>

3345
01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.010
<v Speaker 1>But then if you show the trailer for,</v>

3346
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3347
01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Friday after next,</v>

3348
01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:52.050
<v Speaker 1>then it's a bunch of black people in those trays because white is considered to</v>

3349
01:22:52.051 --> 01:22:53.220
<v Speaker 1>be normal in this country.</v>

3350
01:22:53.221 --> 01:22:55.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the white is the default.</v>

3351
01:22:55.890 --> 01:22:56.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like on the census,</v>

3352
01:22:56.821 --> 01:22:58.050
<v Speaker 1>which is you upload the census form.</v>

3353
01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.630
<v Speaker 1>The first category when they hit on the race category,</v>

3354
01:23:00.631 --> 01:23:02.130
<v Speaker 1>the list of races is white.</v>

3355
01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:03.600
<v Speaker 1>So it's not alphabetical.</v>

3356
01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:04.990
<v Speaker 1>It's just white.</v>

3357
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3358
01:23:05.290 --> 01:23:05.710
<v Speaker 1>White.</v>

3359
01:23:05.710 --> 01:23:06.521
<v Speaker 1>And then if you're not that,</v>

3360
01:23:06.521 --> 01:23:07.330
<v Speaker 1>what else are you,</v>

3361
01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:09.070
<v Speaker 1>and it's like white people are busy.</v>

3362
01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:09.380
<v Speaker 1>We got to,</v>

3363
01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:09.930
<v Speaker 1>you need to go with,</v>

3364
01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:10.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3365
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:12.700
<v Speaker 1>so it's the white is considered the default.</v>

3366
01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:13.850
<v Speaker 1>And when people say things like,</v>

3367
01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:15.760
<v Speaker 1>like I've talked about this before,</v>

3368
01:23:15.761 --> 01:23:19.090
<v Speaker 1>like people magazine is about white people for the most part,</v>

3369
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:21.670
<v Speaker 1>but essence says it's a black magazine,</v>

3370
01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:22.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3371
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:22.211
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3372
01:23:22.211 --> 01:23:22.421
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3373
01:23:22.421 --> 01:23:23.080
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

3374
01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:23.801
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

3375
01:23:23.801 --> 01:23:24.910
<v Speaker 1>and I feel like white people,</v>

3376
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:28.360
<v Speaker 1>one way to sort of put less racism or is white people have to start putting</v>

3377
01:23:28.361 --> 01:23:29.320
<v Speaker 1>white on their magazines.</v>

3378
01:23:29.321 --> 01:23:30.130
<v Speaker 1>I have to start.</v>

3379
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:32.890
<v Speaker 1>If white people got more comfortable with talking about their whiteness,</v>

3380
01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:35.860
<v Speaker 1>it would make the rest of us not look crazy when we talked about her ethnicity.</v>

3381
01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.750
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes when I go as a black man,</v>

3382
01:23:37.751 --> 01:23:38.051
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

3383
01:23:38.051 --> 01:23:40.240
<v Speaker 1>well how do you have to white people can't.</v>

3384
01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.190
<v Speaker 1>If white people talk about their ethnicity,</v>

3385
01:23:42.191 --> 01:23:45.640
<v Speaker 1>if white people say we're going to have the white actors awards,</v>

3386
01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.193
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3387
01:23:47.410 --> 01:23:48.131
<v Speaker 1>well that's a problem.</v>

3388
01:23:48.131 --> 01:23:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Shit would not cause some white people,</v>

3389
01:23:50.441 --> 01:23:51.940
<v Speaker 1>it's wouldn't fly because white,</v>

3390
01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:52.900
<v Speaker 1>when people's,</v>

3391
01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:53.920
<v Speaker 1>historically in this country,</v>

3392
01:23:53.921 --> 01:23:55.300
<v Speaker 1>when people identify themselves as white,</v>

3393
01:23:55.301 --> 01:23:58.780
<v Speaker 1>it's the clan or it's neo Nazis and I feel like good white people like</v>

3394
01:23:58.781 --> 01:24:01.240
<v Speaker 1>yourselves have to have to take whiteness back.</v>

3395
01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for including me in the group.</v>

3396
01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that very much.</v>

3397
01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:07.690
<v Speaker 1>You know what someone said to me also is that white power,</v>

3398
01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:08.890
<v Speaker 1>like Brown,</v>

3399
01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Brown pride is a tattoo that Cain Velasquez,</v>

3400
01:24:11.231 --> 01:24:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Hassan and nobody came to Alaska as the heavyweight champion of the world.</v>

3401
01:24:14.381 --> 01:24:17.440
<v Speaker 1>No one gives him a hard time for having brown pride tattooed on his chest</v>

3402
01:24:17.441 --> 01:24:19.060
<v Speaker 1>because he said he's proud to be Mexican,</v>

3403
01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:21.370
<v Speaker 1>but if you had white pride tattooed on your chest,</v>

3404
01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.540
<v Speaker 1>that's a different animal.</v>

3405
01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.190
<v Speaker 1>So I said this to my friend and he was like,</v>

3406
01:24:24.191 --> 01:24:24.401
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3407
01:24:24.401 --> 01:24:24.941
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

3408
01:24:24.941 --> 01:24:26.200
<v Speaker 1>You could have Irish pride.</v>

3409
01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:26.860
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3410
01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:27.071
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

3411
01:24:27.071 --> 01:24:27.904
<v Speaker 1>that's so true.</v>

3412
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:30.100
<v Speaker 1>And you could have Irish pride tattooed on your chest.</v>

3413
01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:30.431
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

3414
01:24:30.431 --> 01:24:31.264
<v Speaker 1>The differences,</v>

3415
01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:35.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean average people that have not been known to be like slave masters and not</v>

3416
01:24:35.831 --> 01:24:37.630
<v Speaker 1>been known to be KKK members.</v>

3417
01:24:37.631 --> 01:24:40.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a traditional background for them.</v>

3418
01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:40.690
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3419
01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:41.111
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

3420
01:24:41.111 --> 01:24:41.291
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3421
01:24:41.291 --> 01:24:42.011
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's also,</v>

3422
01:24:42.011 --> 01:24:43.360
<v Speaker 1>it's about the,</v>

3423
01:24:43.361 --> 01:24:45.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a nationality there versus white.</v>

3424
01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.760
<v Speaker 1>White was an invented concept in this country.</v>

3425
01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:49.721
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3426
01:24:49.721 --> 01:24:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Like you're in Europe,</v>

3427
01:24:51.130 --> 01:24:51.580
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

3428
01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:52.450
<v Speaker 1>they think racist.</v>

3429
01:24:52.451 --> 01:24:55.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't think racism exists in Europe because it's all about now it's like</v>

3430
01:24:55.001 --> 01:24:56.230
<v Speaker 1>the French hate the Spanish.</v>

3431
01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:57.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

3432
01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:58.090
<v Speaker 1>they don't really white.</v>

3433
01:24:58.091 --> 01:24:58.511
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing,</v>

3434
01:24:58.511 --> 01:24:59.201
<v Speaker 1>we don't have racism.</v>

3435
01:24:59.201 --> 01:24:59.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3436
01:24:59.381 --> 01:25:00.640
<v Speaker 1>But you still have nationalism.</v>

3437
01:25:00.730 --> 01:25:01.563
<v Speaker 1>Weird Shit.</v>

3438
01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:02.681
<v Speaker 1>And over they're like,</v>

3439
01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:03.550
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to hate Arabs.</v>

3440
01:25:03.551 --> 01:25:04.091
<v Speaker 1>That's different.</v>

3441
01:25:04.091 --> 01:25:04.924
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3442
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:06.130
<v Speaker 1>but in this country,</v>

3443
01:25:06.131 --> 01:25:07.540
<v Speaker 1>white became this invented concept.</v>

3444
01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:11.080
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why white power is hard for people to take is because white</v>

3445
01:25:11.081 --> 01:25:12.940
<v Speaker 1>people already got the power when he,</v>

3446
01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:17.830
<v Speaker 1>when Cain Velasquez attached says Brown pride is because Brown people don't feel</v>

3447
01:25:17.831 --> 01:25:19.420
<v Speaker 1>like they've got enough power.</v>

3448
01:25:19.690 --> 01:25:23.140
<v Speaker 1>And it's a way to invoke a feeling of power and invoke the thing that Brown</v>

3449
01:25:23.141 --> 01:25:24.160
<v Speaker 1>people who have been shit on.</v>

3450
01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to take the power back.</v>

3451
01:25:25.541 --> 01:25:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Black power came out of black people going,</v>

3452
01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:28.300
<v Speaker 1>we're tired of being shit on.</v>

3453
01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:29.320
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to say black power,</v>

3454
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:30.310
<v Speaker 1>white power.</v>

3455
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:31.061
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>

3456
01:25:31.061 --> 01:25:31.894
<v Speaker 1>White people,</v>

3457
01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you got it done.</v>

3458
01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:34.571
<v Speaker 1>Didn't fuck.</v>

3459
01:25:34.571 --> 01:25:36.670
<v Speaker 1>And so when the white people for white power on it feels like,</v>

3460
01:25:36.671 --> 01:25:36.791
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

3461
01:25:36.791 --> 01:25:37.810
<v Speaker 1>how much power are you going to tell?</v>

3462
01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:39.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3463
01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:40.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3464
01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.130
<v Speaker 1>just cause then it becomes about we don't want you in our schools,</v>

3465
01:25:42.131 --> 01:25:44.530
<v Speaker 1>we don't want black people in our schools are bumpy when our school like these</v>

3466
01:25:44.531 --> 01:25:45.260
<v Speaker 1>can we go to,</v>

3467
01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:47.680
<v Speaker 1>can't we see or we don't want you drinking out of our water fountain.</v>

3468
01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:48.161
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3469
01:25:48.161 --> 01:25:48.940
<v Speaker 1>It becomes this,</v>

3470
01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:50.470
<v Speaker 1>the power gives so crazy.</v>

3471
01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:51.640
<v Speaker 1>But I believe,</v>

3472
01:25:51.641 --> 01:25:52.030
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>

3473
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I got a kid who's half white that if white people,</v>

3474
01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:00.840
<v Speaker 1>good white people actually reclaimed words like white power and white pride for</v>

3475
01:26:01.331 --> 01:26:02.500
<v Speaker 1>the sake of good things.</v>

3476
01:26:02.501 --> 01:26:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Like cause there's things you can be proud of,</v>

3477
01:26:03.801 --> 01:26:04.634
<v Speaker 1>you white about.</v>

3478
01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:05.361
<v Speaker 1>And it got,</v>

3479
01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:08.780
<v Speaker 1>and it became something that wasn't about neonazis are swastikas.</v>

3480
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:11.120
<v Speaker 1>That it would change the race discussion in this country.</v>

3481
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:12.530
<v Speaker 1>That if white people could sit around and go,</v>

3482
01:26:12.531 --> 01:26:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud to be white without us going,</v>

3483
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:14.540
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3484
01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:15.330
<v Speaker 1>something bad's about this.</v>

3485
01:26:15.330 --> 01:26:18.520
<v Speaker 1>No one would able to be able to do that because if you even say that at all,</v>

3486
01:26:18.521 --> 01:26:19.460
<v Speaker 1>you can pendulum shift.</v>

3487
01:26:19.461 --> 01:26:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to push it down it,</v>

3488
01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's ever going to fly down.</v>

3489
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:26.060
<v Speaker 1>I have to yell out here on the edges so that in the middle people can go,</v>

3490
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:26.241
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3491
01:26:26.241 --> 01:26:26.931
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to do that,</v>

3492
01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:28.400
<v Speaker 1>but let's at least talk about racism.</v>

3493
01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:29.000
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3494
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.000
<v Speaker 1>You could do it as a sketch and make like a bunch of buffoonish,</v>

3495
01:26:34.431 --> 01:26:36.430
<v Speaker 1>cartoonish white people who are calling.</v>

3496
01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.470
<v Speaker 1>We're proud to be why we love black folks.</v>

3497
01:26:39.471 --> 01:26:40.820
<v Speaker 1>I love Tyler Perry,</v>

3498
01:26:41.010 --> 01:26:41.361
<v Speaker 1>but says,</v>

3499
01:26:41.361 --> 01:26:41.471
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3500
01:26:41.471 --> 01:26:42.380
<v Speaker 1>it's not about loving bite.</v>

3501
01:26:42.381 --> 01:26:43.400
<v Speaker 1>It's about living white things.</v>

3502
01:26:43.401 --> 01:26:43.910
<v Speaker 1>It's about like,</v>

3503
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I love Mumford and sons quite as fun.</v>

3504
01:26:47.121 --> 01:26:47.861
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3505
01:26:47.861 --> 01:26:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3506
01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Too White for me.</v>

3507
01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:50.150
<v Speaker 1>That hurts me.</v>

3508
01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:51.650
<v Speaker 1>That's what they went so white.</v>

3509
01:26:51.651 --> 01:26:52.670
<v Speaker 1>They went back in time.</v>

3510
01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:54.620
<v Speaker 1>You'll notice that Mumford and sons,</v>

3511
01:26:54.621 --> 01:26:55.970
<v Speaker 1>they're essentially white.</v>

3512
01:26:55.971 --> 01:26:57.190
<v Speaker 1>When slavery was legal,</v>

3513
01:26:57.710 --> 01:26:58.521
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're doing.</v>

3514
01:26:58.521 --> 01:26:59.990
<v Speaker 1>They're drinking out of mason jars.</v>

3515
01:26:59.991 --> 01:27:01.850
<v Speaker 1>They all have fucking chapter plantation,</v>

3516
01:27:01.851 --> 01:27:02.091
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>

3517
01:27:02.091 --> 01:27:02.840
<v Speaker 1>What are you guys doing?</v>

3518
01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:03.770
<v Speaker 1>You're wearing vests.</v>

3519
01:27:03.771 --> 01:27:05.510
<v Speaker 1>You pretending you're the outlaw Josey Wales.</v>

3520
01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:06.920
<v Speaker 1>The fuck are you doing?</v>

3521
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:09.770
<v Speaker 1>But it's very authentic to a version of whiteness.</v>

3522
01:27:09.771 --> 01:27:11.180
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing about Mumford and sons.</v>

3523
01:27:11.181 --> 01:27:12.014
<v Speaker 1>It feels black.</v>

3524
01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:12.351
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3525
01:27:12.351 --> 01:27:13.330
<v Speaker 1>it's very worth.</v>

3526
01:27:13.330 --> 01:27:13.641
<v Speaker 1>It feels,</v>

3527
01:27:13.641 --> 01:27:14.211
<v Speaker 1>it feels like,</v>

3528
01:27:14.211 --> 01:27:17.120
<v Speaker 1>it feels like white Americana and that's to me it's like man,</v>

3529
01:27:17.121 --> 01:27:18.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a new white,</v>

3530
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:20.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a new white that's an old white guys don't mean it's a throwback to the,</v>

3531
01:27:20.991 --> 01:27:21.371
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3532
01:27:21.371 --> 01:27:23.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like retro to a time where like,</v>

3533
01:27:23.001 --> 01:27:24.440
<v Speaker 1>why are we going back to that time?</v>

3534
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:25.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3535
01:27:25.041 --> 01:27:26.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no black people in those videos.</v>

3536
01:27:26.781 --> 01:27:27.141
<v Speaker 1>Are there,</v>

3537
01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:29.060
<v Speaker 1>is there black people in Mumford and son videos?</v>

3538
01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Can you Google that?</v>

3539
01:27:30.730 --> 01:27:33.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like black people in a Mumford and sons video.</v>

3540
01:27:33.170 --> 01:27:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if they just started with them and find out,</v>

3541
01:27:35.121 --> 01:27:36.320
<v Speaker 1>can I be a black guy in your video?</v>

3542
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:39.860
<v Speaker 1>If a bunch of people came to a black movie theater to see a black movie and they</v>

3543
01:27:39.861 --> 01:27:44.660
<v Speaker 1>just started playing Mumford and son videos before the movie started and people</v>

3544
01:27:44.661 --> 01:27:44.811
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

3545
01:27:44.811 --> 01:27:46.400
<v Speaker 1>white black people just patiently like,</v>

3546
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:47.481
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3547
01:27:47.481 --> 01:27:48.051
<v Speaker 1>so let's just,</v>

3548
01:27:48.051 --> 01:27:48.800
<v Speaker 1>this is what it is.</v>

3549
01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Wait for the movie to start it.</v>

3550
01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Just keep it,</v>

3551
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:51.403
<v Speaker 1>keep it together.</v>

3552
01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Like thinking of like a movie with Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman just</v>

3553
01:27:56.661 --> 01:28:00.770
<v Speaker 1>loaded up a little basset greatest produced by Oprah Winfrey directly by an</v>

3554
01:28:00.771 --> 01:28:05.771
<v Speaker 1>American stars ever in a fucking giant blockbuster like Quintin Tarantino style</v>

3555
01:28:06.531 --> 01:28:07.011
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

3559
01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Places pack with black,</v>

3560
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:20.450
<v Speaker 1>they just played Mumford and sons video after and they troll these people like</v>

3561
01:28:20.451 --> 01:28:21.021
<v Speaker 1>they don't get it.</v>

3562
01:28:21.021 --> 01:28:24.110
<v Speaker 1>They play like a half an hour of Mumford and sons before the movie and it just</v>

3563
01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:27.080
<v Speaker 1>starts the black and then a new one started phase up into a new video.</v>

3564
01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:28.503
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

3565
01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:31.570
<v Speaker 1>You should do that for a fucking show,</v>

3566
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:32.423
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3567
01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Do that for sure.</v>

3568
01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Just troll the people.</v>

3569
01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3570
01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.561
<v Speaker 1>my God.</v>

3571
01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:37.580
<v Speaker 1>That would be incredible.</v>

3572
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:38.061
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3573
01:28:38.061 --> 01:28:38.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

3574
01:28:38.501 --> 01:28:38.840
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3575
01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:39.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny thing.</v>

3576
01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:39.851
<v Speaker 1>It reminds me,</v>

3577
01:28:39.851 --> 01:28:41.210
<v Speaker 1>it was like one time I was watching,</v>

3578
01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:44.750
<v Speaker 1>I was flipping the channels and I flip past like the country music channel and I</v>

3579
01:28:44.751 --> 01:28:46.040
<v Speaker 1>stopped because it was a music,</v>

3580
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:48.860
<v Speaker 1>it was a video that was playing on the country music channel except there was</v>

3581
01:28:48.861 --> 01:28:49.694
<v Speaker 1>black people in it.</v>

3582
01:28:50.210 --> 01:28:50.621
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3583
01:28:50.621 --> 01:28:51.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3584
01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:51.391
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3585
01:28:51.391 --> 01:28:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I was like Whoa,</v>

3586
01:28:52.190 --> 01:28:53.150
<v Speaker 1>like what's going on here?</v>

3587
01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Like why there's black people in this country video.</v>

3588
01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.093
<v Speaker 1>Eric's Rucker too.</v>

3589
01:28:56.150 --> 01:28:57.080
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly it.</v>

3590
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:58.700
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that was so funny.</v>

3591
01:28:58.701 --> 01:28:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3592
01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.830
<v Speaker 1>oh since a black guy singing it,</v>

3593
01:29:00.831 --> 01:29:02.520
<v Speaker 1>we could black people in this country.</v>

3594
01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:04.590
<v Speaker 1>There was a man I was like,</v>

3595
01:29:04.591 --> 01:29:05.041
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

3596
01:29:05.041 --> 01:29:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Darrius Rucker for uh,</v>

3597
01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:07.940
<v Speaker 1>he's tapped into it man.</v>

3598
01:29:07.941 --> 01:29:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Cause he tried to release an R and B album and black people went,</v>

3599
01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:10.813
<v Speaker 1>no hoodie.</v>

3600
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3601
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:12.150
<v Speaker 1>that's the point.</v>

3602
01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think he's authentic to himself.</v>

3603
01:29:13.530 --> 01:29:15.600
<v Speaker 1>But after Hootie and the blowfish,</v>

3604
01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:18.120
<v Speaker 1>he released an R and B album for black people.</v>

3605
01:29:18.190 --> 01:29:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Are you show us Jamie?</v>

3606
01:29:19.390 --> 01:29:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3607
01:29:19.570 --> 01:29:20.403
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

3608
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:21.303
<v Speaker 1>there's a bright light.</v>

3609
01:29:21.810 --> 01:29:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3610
01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:27.400
<v Speaker 1>oh</v>

3611
01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:30.220
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't count.</v>

3612
01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:32.160
<v Speaker 1>It is from the movie Mandela.</v>

3613
01:29:32.370 --> 01:29:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Black James Bond doesn't count as an average black person.</v>

3614
01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Get that fucking shit off our screen.</v>

3615
01:29:37.210 --> 01:29:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Although I like good looking guy.</v>

3616
01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:39.651
<v Speaker 1>He's a great actor.</v>

3617
01:29:39.651 --> 01:29:40.321
<v Speaker 1>He is and all that.</v>

3618
01:29:40.321 --> 01:29:41.040
<v Speaker 1>But she,</v>

3619
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:41.731
<v Speaker 1>how dare you,</v>

3620
01:29:41.731 --> 01:29:43.280
<v Speaker 1>how dare you say,</v>

3621
01:29:43.690 --> 01:29:47.580
<v Speaker 1>well how about a big movie that he's playing and he's playing a fucking guy.</v>

3622
01:29:47.581 --> 01:29:49.320
<v Speaker 1>He's like a serial killer and uh,</v>

3623
01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:51.840
<v Speaker 1>he goes after a black woman,</v>

3624
01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.570
<v Speaker 1>like he knocks on the door in the middle of the night,</v>

3625
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:58.060
<v Speaker 1>tells her that his car broke down at an awkward time to release that movie.</v>

3626
01:29:58.570 --> 01:29:59.403
<v Speaker 1>Oculus.</v>

3627
01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3628
01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3629
01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:00.691
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3630
01:30:00.691 --> 01:30:01.524
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3631
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3632
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:03.770
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm not trying to be an actor.</v>

3633
01:30:04.050 --> 01:30:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Not a star in a movie where like he gets the girl.</v>

3634
01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:07.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3635
01:30:07.890 --> 01:30:08.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3636
01:30:08.410 --> 01:30:09.780
<v Speaker 1>no cause black guys got it.</v>

3637
01:30:09.781 --> 01:30:10.291
<v Speaker 1>We always got it.</v>

3638
01:30:10.291 --> 01:30:11.040
<v Speaker 1>We always got to do,</v>

3639
01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.180
<v Speaker 1>we always got to go a different way,</v>

3640
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:12.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3641
01:30:12.811 --> 01:30:15.720
<v Speaker 1>cause if anybody should be playing a black superhero should be that dude.</v>

3642
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:16.320
<v Speaker 1>But no.</v>

3643
01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:19.770
<v Speaker 1>How about the serial killer first Denzel Washington got to play.</v>

3644
01:30:19.771 --> 01:30:21.390
<v Speaker 1>He's the closest to that.</v>

3645
01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:21.960
<v Speaker 1>That guy,</v>

3646
01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:26.960
<v Speaker 1>he got to play like real superstar type roles that like you would maybe see like</v>

3647
01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:32.620
<v Speaker 1>someone else like George Clooney or Brad Pitt or even he sort of never heat.</v>

3648
01:30:32.630 --> 01:30:33.090
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>

3649
01:30:33.090 --> 01:30:35.280
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't do like romantic comedies.</v>

3650
01:30:35.281 --> 01:30:35.391
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3651
01:30:35.391 --> 01:30:35.611
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3652
01:30:35.611 --> 01:30:37.380
<v Speaker 1>he's clearly doing it bay specific for,</v>

3653
01:30:37.381 --> 01:30:40.470
<v Speaker 1>he's very hemmed into the thing whether he's demonstrates choosing it,</v>

3654
01:30:40.471 --> 01:30:44.040
<v Speaker 1>but he's not doing like you don't see him in like a full on broad comedy.</v>

3655
01:30:44.041 --> 01:30:46.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't see him doing like George Clooney though.</v>

3656
01:30:46.410 --> 01:30:46.771
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

3657
01:30:46.771 --> 01:30:47.221
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3658
01:30:47.221 --> 01:30:52.221
<v Speaker 1>but George Clooney always gets the girl and Denzel Washington is in these movies</v>

3659
01:30:52.291 --> 01:30:55.710
<v Speaker 1>where like he was in the Pelican brief and it's one of those movies where he</v>

3660
01:30:55.711 --> 01:30:57.960
<v Speaker 1>shot him and Julia Roberts did ended up together.</v>

3661
01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>

3662
01:30:58.500 --> 01:30:59.333
<v Speaker 1>And they don't,</v>

3663
01:30:59.400 --> 01:30:59.851
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

3664
01:30:59.851 --> 01:31:00.390
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

3665
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:01.680
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know whose decision that is,</v>

3666
01:31:01.681 --> 01:31:02.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's like George Clooney,</v>

3667
01:31:02.701 --> 01:31:03.570
<v Speaker 1>no matter what movie did,</v>

3668
01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:06.240
<v Speaker 1>it ends up at the end with him kissing the girl and then the credits rolling.</v>

3669
01:31:06.570 --> 01:31:07.170
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

3670
01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:07.771
<v Speaker 1>Whereas dental,</v>

3671
01:31:07.771 --> 01:31:09.090
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's always a reason.</v>

3672
01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:09.810
<v Speaker 1>He's always a,</v>

3673
01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:11.190
<v Speaker 1>not that it doesn't always work out for him.</v>

3674
01:31:11.191 --> 01:31:11.851
<v Speaker 1>We used to get them killed.</v>

3675
01:31:11.851 --> 01:31:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3676
01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.090
<v Speaker 1>has disciplined and he can keep the pussy away.</v>

3677
01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Very disciplined martial artist or something.</v>

3678
01:31:18.490 --> 01:31:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3679
01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:19.440
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3680
01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:23.370
<v Speaker 1>there's a trend going on now though to sort of avoid,</v>

3681
01:31:23.470 --> 01:31:24.303
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't sound.</v>

3682
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:25.621
<v Speaker 1>What about him?</v>

3683
01:31:25.621 --> 01:31:28.710
<v Speaker 1>He sent a bunch of movies where he gets to do that cause he's this post he's</v>

3684
01:31:28.711 --> 01:31:29.600

<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

3688
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:34.470
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing he gets to do the things that Denzel either doesn't want to do</v>

3689
01:31:34.471 --> 01:31:35.880
<v Speaker 1>or can't do because it feels like he can't,</v>

3690
01:31:35.881 --> 01:31:37.290
<v Speaker 1>he does romantic comedies too though.</v>

3691
01:31:37.290 --> 01:31:38.280
<v Speaker 1>He did like hitch.</v>

3692

01:31:45.391 --> 01:31:47.520
<v Speaker 1>He's 100% serious and legit.</v>

3700
01:31:47.730 --> 01:31:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Even though he's funny.</v>

3701
01:31:48.571 --> 01:31:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's very funny and movies,</v>

3702
01:31:49.681 --> 01:31:50.371
<v Speaker 1>but he's not,</v>

3703
01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:54.000
<v Speaker 1>he just this clearly a thing that he's walking a path that I don't want to be</v>

3704
01:31:54.001 --> 01:31:59.001
<v Speaker 1>caught up in a thing where he still holding the baton of blackness in a way that</v>

3705
01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.790
<v Speaker 1>people after him don't have to hold it.</v>

3706
01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:03.340
<v Speaker 1>What I was talking about was not going to do movie where he or you played the</v>

3707
01:32:03.341 --> 01:32:04.600
<v Speaker 1>guy who beats up the black women.</v>

3708
01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:05.321
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

3709
01:32:05.321 --> 01:32:05.681
<v Speaker 1>like he,</v>

3710
01:32:05.681 --> 01:32:06.160
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>

3711
01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:10.780
<v Speaker 1>he's not gonna do that movie unless that dude get some murder gangster and yes.</v>

3712
01:32:10.781 --> 01:32:11.650
<v Speaker 1>And he always,</v>

3713
01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:13.150
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3714
01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:13.961
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3715
01:32:13.961 --> 01:32:15.040
<v Speaker 1>that guy ends up at the end.</v>

3716
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.970
<v Speaker 1>If you notice whenever he does the movie about the guy who was in,</v>

3717
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:17.823
<v Speaker 1>it was like a villain.</v>

3718
01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:20.260
<v Speaker 1>He gets killed or he ends up at the end broken.</v>

3719
01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:23.610
<v Speaker 1>He never does a thing where that guy goes out on top or like,</v>

3720
01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:24.401
<v Speaker 1>like training days,</v>

3721
01:32:24.401 --> 01:32:26.350
<v Speaker 1>a great movie until I think I got to die.</v>

3722
01:32:26.351 --> 01:32:26.681
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3723
01:32:26.681 --> 01:32:29.340
<v Speaker 1>like he always gets a come up and sit at the end.</v>

3724
01:32:29.341 --> 01:32:30.174
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

3725
01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:32.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a very moral thing he's doing because he wants to show this is not how you</v>

3726
01:32:32.771 --> 01:32:33.604
<v Speaker 1>live your life.</v>

3727
01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it was a conscious decision on his part?</v>

3728
01:32:36.190 --> 01:32:37.360
<v Speaker 1>He chooses those roles.</v>

3729

<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3757
01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:04.271
<v Speaker 1>That's always weird.</v>

3758
01:33:04.271 --> 01:33:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Like the guy from the walking dead.</v>

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard the director guy from the walking dead?</v>

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:26.450
<v Speaker 1>cause he wanted people to accept Batman is bad.</v>

3773
01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.410
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to throw them off with a pretty sexist,</v>

3774
01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:29.350
<v Speaker 1>fake accents.</v>

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:32.733
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Body.</v>

3825
01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I never liked him as wolverine,</v>

3826
01:34:34.331 --> 01:34:35.440
<v Speaker 1>but that's my own ways.</v>

3827
01:34:35.441 --> 01:34:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Too Tall.</v>

3828
01:34:36.130 --> 01:34:38.260
<v Speaker 1>You're too tall to be built.</v>

3829
01:34:38.261 --> 01:34:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Like Hector Lombard supposed to be this.</v>

3830
01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it was supposed to be supposed to be like a young Robert De Niro.</v>

3831
01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Not even a Robertson.</v>

3832
01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:44.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3833
01:34:44.231 --> 01:34:45.370
<v Speaker 1>but definitely too good looking,</v>

3834
01:34:45.371 --> 01:34:48.880
<v Speaker 1>but it should be like this wide thick tank of a man.</v>

3835
01:34:49.090 --> 01:34:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Like a wolverine.</v>

3836
01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:53.140
<v Speaker 1>The animal was a small animal.</v>

3837
01:34:53.141 --> 01:34:55.480
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy wild and no one wants to fuck with it.</v>

3838
01:34:55.481 --> 01:34:56.314
<v Speaker 1>Covered in hair.</v>

3839
01:34:56.330 --> 01:34:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3840
01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:57.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not to,</v>

3841
01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:57.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3842
01:34:57.450 --> 01:34:58.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not supposed to be as beautiful.</v>

3843
01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Six foot four.</v>

3844
01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:01.010
<v Speaker 1>He's a little man.</v>

3845
01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Perfect abs.</v>

3846
01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.100
<v Speaker 1>The real wolverine was like five,</v>

3847
01:35:04.101 --> 01:35:05.180
<v Speaker 1>six or something like that.</v>

3848
01:35:05.250 --> 01:35:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Just this tank of a little short guy with metal bones and killed a lot of people</v>

3849
01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:11.120
<v Speaker 1>was a fucking murderer.</v>

3850
01:35:11.121 --> 01:35:11.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3851
01:35:11.241 --> 01:35:14.650
<v Speaker 1>That's funny how that's those claws in the movies don't ever like I do.</v>

3852
01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:16.850
<v Speaker 1>The damage that you would think you got claws coming out of your hands,</v>

3853
01:35:16.851 --> 01:35:17.041
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3854
01:35:17.041 --> 01:35:18.440
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it'd be show it,</v>

3855
01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:19.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3856
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.671
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3857
01:35:19.671 --> 01:35:23.750
<v Speaker 1>if they could do an r rated version of wolverine where he's just slicing pizza,</v>

3858
01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:26.380
<v Speaker 1>like they're starting to get the idea that they can make complex boot,</v>

3859
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:27.450
<v Speaker 1>like they're doing a Deadpool movie,</v>

3860
01:35:27.451 --> 01:35:27.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3861
01:35:27.650 --> 01:35:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool,</v>

3862
01:35:28.450 --> 01:35:29.070
<v Speaker 1>like they're doing it.</v>

3863
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:31.010
<v Speaker 1>I feel like they're leaning into like,</v>

3864
01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:31.311
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

3865
01:35:31.311 --> 01:35:33.620
<v Speaker 1>that actually adults want to see superhero movies.</v>

3866
01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.720
<v Speaker 1>But with actual adult things happening.</v>

3867
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3868
01:35:35.871 --> 01:35:36.680
<v Speaker 1>the watchmen,</v>

3869
01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:37.280

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:39.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3875
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:40.250
<v Speaker 1>more of that.</v>

3876
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Cause I,</v>

3877
01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:41.653
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm at this point,</v>

3879
01:35:43.371 --> 01:35:44.001

3880
01:35:44.001 --> 01:35:45.020
<v Speaker 1>and I'd like superhero movies,</v>

3881
01:35:45.021 --> 01:35:46.160
<v Speaker 1>but I'm over them.</v>

3882
01:35:46.190 --> 01:35:47.590
<v Speaker 1>I just like isn't explosions.</v>

3883
01:35:47.710 --> 01:35:49.580
<v Speaker 1>And then you do the CGI and then you do.</v>

3884
01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:50.893
<v Speaker 1>And the thing,</v>

3885

3887
01:35:53.871 --> 01:35:55.190
<v Speaker 1>I was a huge comic book Geek.</v>

3888
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I skipped all the comic movies this summer.</v>

3889
01:35:56.901 --> 01:35:57.734
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

3890
01:35:58.010 --> 01:35:58.731
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't,</v>

3891
01:35:58.731 --> 01:35:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3892
01:35:59.490 --> 01:36:01.550
<v Speaker 1>I the Spiderman movie with Andrew Garfield,</v>

3893
01:36:01.551 --> 01:36:02.384
<v Speaker 1>the first one.</v>

3894
01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:02.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3895
01:36:02.841 --> 01:36:03.630
<v Speaker 1>This is the second one came.</v>

3896
01:36:03.630 --> 01:36:03.921
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3897
01:36:03.921 --> 01:36:04.281
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3898
01:36:04.281 --> 01:36:05.061
<v Speaker 1>And then captain America,</v>

3899
01:36:05.061 --> 01:36:05.661
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

3900
01:36:05.661 --> 01:36:08.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd maybe it's not in my DNA to give a shit about a guy named Captain America.</v>

3901
01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:10.941
<v Speaker 1>That's just too much.</v>

3902
01:36:10.941 --> 01:36:11.691
<v Speaker 1>It's just too much.</v>

3903
01:36:11.691 --> 01:36:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Like come on everybody and he doesn't have any cool powers.</v>

3904
01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I was so I scored a skip those and kind of got sent cool steroids jars.</v>

3905
01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3906
01:36:18.670 --> 01:36:19.290
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3907
01:36:19.290 --> 01:36:20.110
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3908
01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:23.360
<v Speaker 1>he's super steroids or even more so.</v>

3909
01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3910
01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:24.681
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3911
01:36:24.681 --> 01:36:25.251
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

3912
01:36:25.251 --> 01:36:28.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference between a guy like him and say like a guy like the hulk.</v>

3913
01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:29.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3914
01:36:29.151 --> 01:36:30.050
<v Speaker 1>I can get behind the hall.</v>

3915
01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I can get behind.</v>

3916
01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:32.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the same thing as my favorite of all time.</v>

3917
01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:33.471
<v Speaker 1>That's me.</v>

3918
01:36:33.471 --> 01:36:33.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

3919
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:34.611
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid.</v>

3920
01:36:34.611 --> 01:36:37.820
<v Speaker 1>I remember the hulk TV shows like the new hawk.</v>

3921
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:40.760
<v Speaker 1>The thing about the Hawk now as they can make it look real,</v>

3922
01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:43.430
<v Speaker 1>like the CGI is so good.</v>

3923
01:36:43.670 --> 01:36:44.660
<v Speaker 1>And what's his name?</v>

3924
01:36:44.690 --> 01:36:45.920
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is the new dudes name?</v>

3925
01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:46.701
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3926
01:36:46.701 --> 01:36:47.170

01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:47.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3929
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:51.160
<v Speaker 1>the guy who plays a really good actor fucking,</v>

3930
01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:52.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3931
01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:52.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:53.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3933
01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:54.260
<v Speaker 1>I need that pill mark.</v>

3934
01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.490
<v Speaker 1>The mark ruffled up there goes.</v>

3935
01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3936
01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:58.600
<v Speaker 1>He's a really good at and he's a great,</v>

3937
01:36:58.630 --> 01:36:59.840
<v Speaker 1>it was good too.</v>

3938
01:36:59.930 --> 01:37:00.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3939
01:37:00.191 --> 01:37:00.981
<v Speaker 1>I had known it would have been good.</v>

3940
01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I just think the CGI was not up to snuff with Panasonic TV.</v>

3941
01:37:03.710 --> 01:37:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3942
01:37:03.930 --> 01:37:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Eric.</v>

3943
01:37:04.090 --> 01:37:04.380
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3944
01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:04.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3945
01:37:04.551 --> 01:37:05.384
<v Speaker 1>that was a good bridge.</v>

3946
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Players,</v>

3947
01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:06.740
<v Speaker 1>not six foot four,</v>

3948
01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.240
<v Speaker 1>220 pounds.</v>

3949
01:37:08.241 --> 01:37:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Looking at people like,</v>

3950
01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:10.270
<v Speaker 1>don't make me turn that off.</v>

3951
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:11.690
<v Speaker 1>You're already the hall already.</v>

3952
01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:12.533
<v Speaker 1>Huge</v>

3953
01:37:14.010 --> 01:37:14.811
<v Speaker 1>anger issues.</v>

3954
01:37:14.811 --> 01:37:16.100
<v Speaker 1>He's great and chopper.</v>

3955
01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:17.220
<v Speaker 1>But I just think that that,</v>

3956
01:37:17.370 --> 01:37:19.760
<v Speaker 1>that movie that he was in was not a good hulk.</v>

3957
01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:22.490
<v Speaker 1>And we'll hang Lee and I think he's a great director.</v>

3958
01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Admitted he had,</v>

3959
01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.640
<v Speaker 1>didn't know who the hulk was when he took the movie.</v>

3960
01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3961
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:26.270
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

3962
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:27.230
<v Speaker 1>They basically gave it to him.</v>

3963
01:37:27.231 --> 01:37:28.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a big Hollywood director.</v>

3964
01:37:28.881 --> 01:37:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to do this soup,</v>

3965
01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:30.710
<v Speaker 1>this superhero movie?</v>

3966
01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:31.340
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

3967
01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:32.060
<v Speaker 1>so he didn't,</v>

3968
01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:34.820
<v Speaker 1>there was no sense that he actually understood or cared,</v>

3969
01:37:34.821 --> 01:37:36.260
<v Speaker 1>really love the source material.</v>

3970
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

3971
01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:38.413
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

3972
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:40.850
<v Speaker 1>sacrilege.</v>

3973
01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:41.601
<v Speaker 1>I still feel like,</v>

3974
01:37:41.601 --> 01:37:43.070
<v Speaker 1>just let Lou Ferrigno do it every time.</v>

3975
01:37:43.071 --> 01:37:43.700
<v Speaker 1>But that's me.</v>

3976
01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:44.533
<v Speaker 1>I'm old school.</v>

3977
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Be The hulk too.</v>

3978
01:37:47.421 --> 01:37:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Fucking small.</v>

3979
01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:51.230
<v Speaker 1>But when you saw lord of the rings,</v>

3980
01:37:51.231 --> 01:37:53.420
<v Speaker 1>fucking Gandalf is not really that tall in real life.</v>

3981
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:53.900
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>

3982
01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:58.050
<v Speaker 1>they can do stuff I gas but just doesn't look like well I just,</v>

3983
01:37:58.230 --> 01:38:01.590
<v Speaker 1>I just think I would rather a person was doing it because I just think it would</v>

3984
01:38:01.591 --> 01:38:02.940
<v Speaker 1>be better cause then it's a person,</v>

3985
01:38:02.941 --> 01:38:04.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not CGI.</v>

3986
01:38:04.110 --> 01:38:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind the Hawk being CGI because there's no real hulk like w were CGI</v>

3987
01:38:09.421 --> 01:38:12.960
<v Speaker 1>looks weird is when it's a CGI version of a real thing.</v>

3988
01:38:13.290 --> 01:38:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Like especially animals.</v>

3989
01:38:14.581 --> 01:38:15.750
<v Speaker 1>They're not good at that yet.</v>

3990
01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Like for like even in the game of Thrones,</v>

3991
01:38:18.061 --> 01:38:19.050
<v Speaker 1>like you see the dogs,</v>

3992
01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:19.620
<v Speaker 1>the wolves,</v>

3993
01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:20.790
<v Speaker 1>the dire wolves like that.</v>

3994
01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:22.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not really there.</v>

3995
01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I can kind of pretend it's they're touching the ground and there's something</v>

3996
01:38:25.771 --> 01:38:26.610
<v Speaker 1>going on here.</v>

3997
01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:31.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the worst version was the lions in a I am legend.</v>

3998
01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Remember that Shit.</v>

3999
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:35.910
<v Speaker 1>It was so goofy.</v>

4000
01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4001
01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:37.350
<v Speaker 1>oh Christ.</v>

4002
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:41.070
<v Speaker 1>They're the one that I think it was like when the titanic came out and there's a</v>

4003
01:38:41.071 --> 01:38:41.904
<v Speaker 1>shot where they,</v>

4004
01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:44.330
<v Speaker 1>they sweep over the ship and you see</v>

4005
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:47.340
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any means</v>

4006
01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever to their knees.</v>

4007
01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Well it's like the opening scene in a video game.</v>

4008
01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're getting like,</v>

4009
01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:54.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4010
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:55.690
<v Speaker 1>the load screen mark,</v>

4011
01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:57.870
<v Speaker 1>the cinematic as a cinematic where it's like,</v>

4012
01:38:57.871 --> 01:38:59.250
<v Speaker 1>well this isn't the game but this is,</v>

4013
01:38:59.410 --> 01:39:01.020
<v Speaker 1>this makes you think the game was going to be cool.</v>

4014
01:39:01.050 --> 01:39:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4015
01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:02.011
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4016
01:39:02.011 --> 01:39:02.840
<v Speaker 1>that's a I'm not,</v>

4017
01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:03.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4018
01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I skipped out on the ones.</v>

4019
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4020
01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:07.200
<v Speaker 1>they're just not quite there yet.</v>

4021
01:39:07.201 --> 01:39:08.070
<v Speaker 1>With Cgi,</v>

4022
01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:11.760
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about this the other day with monster movies that like they show</v>

4023
01:39:11.761 --> 01:39:12.690
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>

4024
01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Like the American Werewolf in London is the perfect example.</v>

4025
01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.850
<v Speaker 1>You only see that Werewolf like brief seconds.</v>

4026
01:39:18.210 --> 01:39:18.811
<v Speaker 1>And so your,</v>

4027
01:39:18.811 --> 01:39:22.200
<v Speaker 1>your imagination has to kind of do a lot of work and it's still scary.</v>

4028
01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.210
<v Speaker 1>But now when you see a monster movie,</v>

4029
01:39:24.211 --> 01:39:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you see like minutes and minutes,</v>

4030
01:39:26.131 --> 01:39:29.790
<v Speaker 1>that monster monster and it starts to look like a dude in a suit or a CGI thing.</v>

4031
01:39:29.791 --> 01:39:31.040
<v Speaker 1>And there's like a CGI thing.</v>

4032
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Like the I am legend monsters.</v>

4033
01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:34.560
<v Speaker 1>They looked CGI it up.</v>

4034
01:39:34.561 --> 01:39:35.250
<v Speaker 1>They didn't look,</v>

4035
01:39:35.250 --> 01:39:39.900
<v Speaker 1>they didn't look like the 28 days later zombies who are people that just,</v>

4036
01:39:39.901 --> 01:39:43.260
<v Speaker 1>they moved like a real thing that was really in front of you as opposed to these</v>

4037
01:39:43.261 --> 01:39:44.041
<v Speaker 1>things that are moving.</v>

4038
01:39:44.041 --> 01:39:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody created on a computer.</v>

4039
01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Somebody drawn this right now.</v>

4040
01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4041
01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:48.811
<v Speaker 1>But that's just,</v>

4042
01:39:48.811 --> 01:39:49.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4043
01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:50.520
<v Speaker 1>sit at Madec Shit.</v>

4044
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood shit.</v>

4045
01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4046
01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:52.860
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

4047
01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:54.870
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about like Tyler Perry movies?</v>

4048
01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:02.120
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about like buffoonish versions of black people has done by</v>

4049
01:40:02.341 --> 01:40:02.970
<v Speaker 1>black people?</v>

4050
01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:03.350
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

4051
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.720
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

4052
01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I've have talked about Tyler Perry.</v>

4053
01:40:04.930 --> 01:40:05.230
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

4054
01:40:05.230 --> 01:40:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4055
01:40:05.970 --> 01:40:06.421
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

4056
01:40:06.421 --> 01:40:07.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4057
01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:07.800
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4058
01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:12.780
<v Speaker 1>my problem with Tyler Perry movies is that there's not enough black filmmakers</v>

4059
01:40:12.781 --> 01:40:15.990
<v Speaker 1>out there making movies to not make him look like that's the definitive story of</v>

4060
01:40:15.991 --> 01:40:16.824
<v Speaker 1>black people.</v>

4061
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:18.660
<v Speaker 1>And so it's frustrating when people go,</v>

4062
01:40:18.661 --> 01:40:19.890
<v Speaker 1>that's it right there.</v>

4063
01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the version of it.</v>

4064
01:40:21.061 --> 01:40:21.570
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>

4065
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:22.980
<v Speaker 1>if there was other filmmakers,</v>

4066
01:40:22.981 --> 01:40:23.280
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

4067
01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:23.910
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

4068
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:25.800
<v Speaker 1>if spike Lee was still like,</v>

4069
01:40:25.801 --> 01:40:26.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a viable filmmaker,</v>

4070
01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:27.960
<v Speaker 1>but if there was like,</v>

4071
01:40:27.961 --> 01:40:30.270
<v Speaker 1>there was a point in the 90s where black people started directing movies,</v>

4072
01:40:30.271 --> 01:40:30.541
<v Speaker 1>he thought,</v>

4073
01:40:30.541 --> 01:40:30.691
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4074
01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:32.670
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have a lot of major black movie directors.</v>

4075
01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:33.451
<v Speaker 1>John Singleton,</v>

4076
01:40:33.451 --> 01:40:34.261
<v Speaker 1>John Singleton,</v>

4077
01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Mattie rich slightly predates those people.</v>

4078
01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:37.740
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

4079
01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:38.670
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't,</v>

4080
01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:39.540
<v Speaker 1>there's not a,</v>

4081
01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:43.950
<v Speaker 1>there's still black cinema is still defined by Tyler Perry and Spike Lee Sorta</v>

4082
01:40:43.951 --> 01:40:45.360
<v Speaker 1>got out of the house every now and again,</v>

4083
01:40:45.361 --> 01:40:46.800
<v Speaker 1>does one of his classic spike Lee movies.</v>

4084
01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:47.360
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

4085
01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.193
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

4086
01:40:48.210 --> 01:40:52.380
<v Speaker 1>my problem is that there's not enough choices so that I have to have the Tyler</v>

4087
01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Perry discussion because like,</v>

4088
01:40:53.471 --> 01:40:54.281
<v Speaker 1>nobody ever goes to you,</v>

4089
01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:54.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4090
01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:55.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4091
01:40:55.241 --> 01:40:55.421
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

4092
01:40:55.421 --> 01:40:55.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4093
01:40:55.631 --> 01:40:56.500
<v Speaker 1>he's going to sit you down and go,</v>

4094
01:40:56.770 --> 01:40:59.050
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about a woody Allen movie?</v>

4095
01:40:59.051 --> 01:40:59.441
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

4096
01:40:59.441 --> 01:41:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Like there's not a ton about woody Allen,</v>

4097
01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:01.841
<v Speaker 1>but they're not there.</v>

4098
01:41:01.841 --> 01:41:02.330
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4099
01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4100
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:03.101
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm saying.</v>

4101
01:41:03.101 --> 01:41:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Some VR,</v>

4102
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:07.300
<v Speaker 1>like you're not gonna have to reckon with each and every Hollywood director is,</v>

4103
01:41:07.301 --> 01:41:10.500
<v Speaker 1>it reflects on you represented as a white person would be respond to you.</v>

4104
01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:12.153
<v Speaker 1>You can go,</v>

4105
01:41:12.190 --> 01:41:12.821
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>

4106
01:41:12.821 --> 01:41:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't go,</v>

4107
01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an opinion on Tyler Perry movies.</v>

4108
01:41:14.981 --> 01:41:15.341
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

4109
01:41:15.341 --> 01:41:16.121
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>

4110
01:41:16.121 --> 01:41:17.610
<v Speaker 1>you got it right.</v>

4111
01:41:17.630 --> 01:41:18.071
<v Speaker 1>But you can go,</v>

4112
01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an opinion on what on,</v>

4113
01:41:18.971 --> 01:41:19.450
<v Speaker 1>and you'd be like,</v>

4114
01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:19.661
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4115
01:41:19.661 --> 01:41:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I guess he doesn't.</v>

4116
01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:20.561
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't.</v>

4117
01:41:20.561 --> 01:41:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it doesn't think about it.</v>

4118
01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:22.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4119
01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I have to,</v>

4120
01:41:23.530 --> 01:41:25.300
<v Speaker 1>as a black person wrecking with Tyler Perry,</v>

4121
01:41:25.450 --> 01:41:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad he's employing people.</v>

4122
01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:29.350
<v Speaker 1>He certainly employs more black actresses than anybody else.</v>

4123
01:41:29.351 --> 01:41:32.620
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a black actress in Hollywood and your version is getting beat by</v>

4124
01:41:32.621 --> 01:41:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Idris Elba and a movie or,</v>

4125
01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:38.020
<v Speaker 1>or the the Christian mom who finally meets a man and has a girls club or</v>

4126

4130
01:41:42.641 --> 01:41:45.100

4131
01:41:45.250 --> 01:41:47.110
<v Speaker 1>who's a single mom living in the hood,</v>

<v Speaker 1>trying to get a better opportunity versus Idris Elba going upside your head for</v>

4133
01:41:50.291 --> 01:41:50.921
<v Speaker 1>90 minutes.</v>

4135
01:41:51.341 --> 01:41:53.560
<v Speaker 1>so I so I appreciate that.</v>

4136
01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:54.730
<v Speaker 1>I used to be very like,</v>

4137
01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:56.440
<v Speaker 1>like fuck Tyler Perry about it,</v>

4138
01:41:56.441 --> 01:41:57.274
<v Speaker 1>but I just sort of,</v>

4139
01:41:57.370 --> 01:41:58.600
<v Speaker 1>things are complicated man.</v>

4140
01:41:58.700 --> 01:41:59.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4141
01:41:59.230 --> 01:42:03.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird scenario two where he does things like old school studio style.</v>

4142
01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:03.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4143
01:42:03.641 --> 01:42:04.210
<v Speaker 1>He owns it.</v>

4144
01:42:04.210 --> 01:42:04.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

4145
01:42:04.810 --> 01:42:05.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a part of that word.</v>

4146
01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:06.610
<v Speaker 1>The business side is like,</v>

4147
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:07.810
<v Speaker 1>he owns his own studio,</v>

4148
01:42:07.811 --> 01:42:12.370
<v Speaker 1>so he literally is making the movies he wants to make and there's,</v>

4149
01:42:12.371 --> 01:42:12.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4150
01:42:12.611 --> 01:42:14.290
<v Speaker 1>there's major Hollywood directors who aren't doing that,</v>

4151
01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:14.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4152
01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:15.400

01:42:17.591 --> 01:42:18.460
<v Speaker 1>He casts them.</v>

4157
01:42:18.730 --> 01:42:19.870
<v Speaker 1>He puts himself in them.</v>

4158
01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:22.930
<v Speaker 1>My thing now it's just that thing like Ben Affleck's got a new movie coming out</v>

4203
01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:25.473
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4204
01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:26.381

01:43:26.701 --> 01:43:27.534
<v Speaker 1>what is it about,</v>

4207
01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:28.893
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4208
01:43:29.050 --> 01:43:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's a kid that's basically his darkness,</v>

4209
01:43:31.930 --> 01:43:34.630
<v Speaker 1>kidnapped or something and Tyler praise just in it.</v>

4210
01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Just as,</v>

4211
01:43:35.670 --> 01:43:37.600
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like it's a little bit hard for me to,</v>

4212
01:43:37.810 --> 01:43:38.341
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck is,</v>

4213
01:43:38.341 --> 01:43:40.030
<v Speaker 1>you have time to do all that shit.</v>

4214
01:43:40.090 --> 01:43:40.923
<v Speaker 1>He's got that,</v>

4215
01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:41.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4216
01:43:41.650 --> 01:43:42.483
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

4217
01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I think you can't be that guy without being,</v>

4218
01:43:45.161 --> 01:43:46.870
<v Speaker 1>and I say this in the best way possible.</v>

4219
01:43:46.871 --> 01:43:47.704
<v Speaker 1>A hustler,</v>

4220
01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:48.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4221
01:43:48.281 --> 01:43:48.881
<v Speaker 1>you can't be,</v>

4222
01:43:48.881 --> 01:43:52.520
<v Speaker 1>you can't have gotten to the point that he's at without sort of like making time</v>

4223
01:43:52.521 --> 01:43:53.900
<v Speaker 1>to do as many things as you can do.</v>

4224
01:43:53.901 --> 01:43:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's someone who was living out of his car and doing plays and Baptist</v>

4225
01:43:56.691 --> 01:43:57.620
<v Speaker 1>churches or something.</v>

4226
01:43:57.621 --> 01:43:59.240
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>

4227
01:43:59.241 --> 01:44:01.610
<v Speaker 1>that's where he's to heat the things he did in movies.</v>

4228
01:44:01.611 --> 01:44:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Started out his plays that he did in like community centers and pride church</v>

4229
01:44:05.421 --> 01:44:05.991
<v Speaker 1>basements.</v>

4230
01:44:05.991 --> 01:44:08.780
<v Speaker 1>And he built them up to the thing that you'd go to the Apollo and see a Tyler</v>

4231
01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Perry play like black theater,</v>

4232
01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:11.653
<v Speaker 1>urban black theater.</v>

4233
01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Does he have a hundred year old wife too,</v>

4234
01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:14.173
<v Speaker 1>if you know what I'm saying?</v>

4235
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.960
<v Speaker 1>He's got agreements.</v>

4236
01:44:17.961 --> 01:44:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's got a great range that's like he's not,</v>

4237
01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:22.610
<v Speaker 1>he's not married.</v>

4238
01:44:22.611 --> 01:44:27.611
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have any children taking mom to the movie openings,</v>

4239
01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:30.090
<v Speaker 1>homophobic conversation without</v>

4240
01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:33.280
<v Speaker 1>being homophobic.</v>

4241
01:44:33.281 --> 01:44:34.114
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

4242
01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:35.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you about the dude.</v>

4243
01:44:35.991 --> 01:44:38.180
<v Speaker 1>He takes his mom to the premieres.</v>

4244
01:44:38.181 --> 01:44:39.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't have nothing wrong with that.</v>

4245
01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:40.461
<v Speaker 1>Whatever he is,</v>

4246

<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

4247
01:44:40.651 --> 01:44:41.810
<v Speaker 1>he's successful at it.</v>

4248
01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:43.460
<v Speaker 1>He's like a nice guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And he's also very articulate.</v>

4268
01:45:03.471 --> 01:45:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you noticed that.</v>

4269
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:05.263
<v Speaker 1>He speaks so well.</v>

4270
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't notice color.</v>

4271
01:45:08.010 --> 01:45:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4274
01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

4275
01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:10.880
<v Speaker 1>That's very helpful.</v>

4276
01:45:12.290 --> 01:45:13.730
<v Speaker 1>It's helpful to living in America.</v>

4277
01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:14.960
<v Speaker 1>A white person who doesn't see color.</v>

4278
01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:16.551
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it.</v>

4279
01:45:16.551 --> 01:45:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I just benefit from,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't see gender.</v>

4282
01:45:20.121 --> 01:45:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't see notice white privilege because I didn't even notice that I'm</v>

4283
01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:23.960
<v Speaker 1>whining.</v>

4284

<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

4285
01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Just like I don't notice that I'm six foot four all the time.</v>

4286
01:45:28.491 --> 01:45:29.320
<v Speaker 1>It just Saturday just,</v>

4287
01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I just looked down and this seems to be where everything,</v>

4288
01:45:31.911 --> 01:45:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I can reach everything.</v>

4289
01:45:33.170 --> 01:45:34.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever have to stay.</v>

01:45:34.101 --> 01:45:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Get a step stool.</v>

4291
01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4292
01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I can always see over people at the concerts.</v>

4293
01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:38.140
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

4294
01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:38.880
<v Speaker 1>I've got a long reach.</v>

4295
01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:39.520
<v Speaker 1>If you want a box.</v>

4296
01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4297
01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:40.011
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

4298
01:45:40.011 --> 01:45:40.491
<v Speaker 1>I got high.</v>

4299
01:45:40.491 --> 01:45:41.301
<v Speaker 1>I got high privileged,</v>

4300
01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:42.134
<v Speaker 1>but I don't notice it.</v>

4301
01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:42.501
<v Speaker 1>Height,</v>

4302
01:45:42.501 --> 01:45:43.550
<v Speaker 1>privilege and different things.</v>

4303
01:45:43.551 --> 01:45:44.480
<v Speaker 1>I used to be short,</v>

4304
01:45:44.481 --> 01:45:45.111
<v Speaker 1>so I had no where.</v>

4305
01:45:45.111 --> 01:45:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I can know how short people feel.</v>

4306
01:45:46.970 --> 01:45:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Didn't used to be.</v>

4307
01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:48.290
<v Speaker 1>You didn't grow.</v>

4308
01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:50.300
<v Speaker 1>You weren't black and and grew up into whiteness.</v>

4309
01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:51.111
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

4310
01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:51.800
<v Speaker 1>That's good point.</v>

4311
01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4312
01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:52.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

4313
01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:53.030
<v Speaker 1>that's how I feel about,</v>

4314
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4315
01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:53.691
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

4316
01:45:53.691 --> 01:45:54.800
<v Speaker 1>I was short until I was,</v>

4317
01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:55.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4318
01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:57.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever the definition of short is till high school.</v>

4319
01:45:57.980 --> 01:46:02.150
<v Speaker 1>You started getting tweeted when I was involved in this conversation with a lot</v>

4320
01:46:02.151 --> 01:46:06.650
<v Speaker 1>of people about racism and Jon Jones and uh,</v>

4321
01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:07.250
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4322
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:09.540
<v Speaker 1>you were chiming in about it and uh,</v>

4323
01:46:09.650 --> 01:46:11.660
<v Speaker 1>that was a weird conversation.</v>

4324
01:46:11.661 --> 01:46:12.494
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

4325
01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:14.420
<v Speaker 1>not because uh,</v>

4326
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:16.310
<v Speaker 1>the idea that uh,</v>

4327
01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:18.090
<v Speaker 1>people being racist against a,</v>

4328
01:46:18.091 --> 01:46:18.950
<v Speaker 1>a young fighter.</v>

4329
01:46:18.951 --> 01:46:23.951
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see a guy that's doing very well and has a lot of success and then</v>

4330
01:46:25.341 --> 01:46:28.040
<v Speaker 1>you see a lot of blow back and people criticizing him,</v>

4331
01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder like what is it that they're criticizing?</v>

4332
01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:32.480
<v Speaker 1>They're criticizing his personal life,</v>

4333
01:46:32.481 --> 01:46:33.021
<v Speaker 1>his behavior.</v>

4334
01:46:33.021 --> 01:46:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Like what is he doing that's so terrible.</v>

4335
01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4336
01:46:34.570 --> 01:46:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

4337
01:46:35.130 --> 01:46:35.870
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

4338
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:36.980
<v Speaker 1>how much of that is racism?</v>

4339
01:46:36.981 --> 01:46:41.220
<v Speaker 1>And when I said how much of that is racism shit?</v>

4340
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4341
01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:43.911
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

4342
01:46:43.911 --> 01:46:45.440
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of that is racism.</v>

4343
01:46:45.441 --> 01:46:48.050
<v Speaker 1>And then I also said I think he'd be more popular if he was white.</v>

4344
01:46:48.230 --> 01:46:51.750
<v Speaker 1>And people like you were saying that we don't like him cause we were like people</v>

4345
01:46:51.751 --> 01:46:52.584
<v Speaker 1>made these,</v>

4346
01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:54.720
<v Speaker 1>these big jumps in big conclusions.</v>

4347
01:46:54.721 --> 01:46:58.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like are you saying that he wouldn't be more popular if he was white?</v>

4348
01:46:58.350 --> 01:47:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think that's ridiculous because there's more white people than there are</v>

4349
01:47:02.011 --> 01:47:04.740
<v Speaker 1>black people and white people tend to associate white people.</v>

4350
01:47:04.770 --> 01:47:06.060
<v Speaker 1>They want white hero.</v>

4351
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:07.170
<v Speaker 1>We like to see ourselves.</v>

4352
01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes and that's true of all people.</v>

4353
01:47:09.391 --> 01:47:09.871
<v Speaker 1>We like to see,</v>

4354
01:47:09.871 --> 01:47:11.550
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to see ourselves reflected outside of our,</v>

4355
01:47:11.551 --> 01:47:15.450
<v Speaker 1>so I don't even think that's saying that he's not more popular because of</v>

4356
01:47:15.451 --> 01:47:15.990
<v Speaker 1>racism.</v>

4357
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that's like a racial preference thing.</v>

4358
01:47:18.210 --> 01:47:20.160
<v Speaker 1>But asking the question,</v>

4359
01:47:20.370 --> 01:47:22.470
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if a lot of the blowback,</v>

4360
01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:24.390
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the reason why people don't like him,</v>

4361
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:27.120
<v Speaker 1>his racism and I was,</v>

4362
01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I was a little taken aback.</v>

4363
01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:30.240
<v Speaker 1>It was a front page and saw that.</v>

4364
01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:32.610
<v Speaker 1>I saw that now and that's why I chimed in because I was like,</v>

4365
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>

4366
01:47:33.450 --> 01:47:36.570
<v Speaker 1>oh Joe is experiencing something that I experienced all the time when the in</v>

4367
01:47:36.571 --> 01:47:38.880
<v Speaker 1>these discussions and that's why I sort of reached out like I was trying to</v>

4368
01:47:38.881 --> 01:47:39.241
<v Speaker 1>reach and go,</v>

4369
01:47:39.241 --> 01:47:39.930
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

4370
01:47:39.930 --> 01:47:40.351
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

4371
01:47:40.351 --> 01:47:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're doing.</v>

4372
01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:43.200
<v Speaker 1>I know what's happening here and I'm a white guy,</v>

4373
01:47:43.230 --> 01:47:44.340
<v Speaker 1>so it's hilarious.</v>

4374
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>

4375
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4376
01:47:45.901 --> 01:47:48.480
<v Speaker 1>it's worse because you people acted like you turned trader.</v>

4377
01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:50.333
<v Speaker 1>Racism is,</v>

4378
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:53.580
<v Speaker 1>is that people who would not describe themselves as white people felt like you</v>

4379
01:47:53.581 --> 01:47:56.640
<v Speaker 1>turned on them because you brought up race or people were saying,</v>

4380
01:47:56.641 --> 01:47:57.920
<v Speaker 1>fuck you there.</v>

4381
01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.330
<v Speaker 1>They were tweeting me like some really mean shit.</v>

4382
01:48:00.331 --> 01:48:00.631
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4383
01:48:00.631 --> 01:48:00.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4384
01:48:00.811 --> 01:48:02.580
<v Speaker 1>did you even listen to what I said?</v>

4385
01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Because people didn't even listen.</v>

4386
01:48:03.991 --> 01:48:07.230
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know they saw it on print somewhere and then it was on the</v>

4387
01:48:07.231 --> 01:48:09.490
<v Speaker 1>cover of like a bunch of different news app,</v>

4388
01:48:09.491 --> 01:48:14.490
<v Speaker 1>let's say Joe Rogan attributes Jon Jones a lack of success to racism.</v>

4389
01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4390
01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:19.170
<v Speaker 1>All I said was that I wonder,</v>

4391
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:20.183
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

4392
01:48:20.190 --> 01:48:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of it is racism a similar thing.</v>

4393
01:48:23.581 --> 01:48:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Much smaller happen to me.</v>

4394
01:48:24.661 --> 01:48:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Recently I wrote a,</v>

4395
01:48:25.891 --> 01:48:26.550
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>

4396
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4397
01:48:26.691 --> 01:48:29.010
<v Speaker 1>The buzzfeed buzzfeed reached out to me and said,</v>

4398
01:48:29.011 --> 01:48:31.320
<v Speaker 1>do you want to write a thing about lack of diversity in late night?</v>

4399
01:48:31.770 --> 01:48:33.560
<v Speaker 1>I would been there like you may be over talking about it.</v>

4400
01:48:33.561 --> 01:48:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

4401
01:48:33.650 --> 01:48:34.411
<v Speaker 1>Not write a thing about it.</v>

4402
01:48:34.411 --> 01:48:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I got things to say about it and my thing was,</v>

4403
01:48:36.570 --> 01:48:37.290
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

4404
01:48:37.290 --> 01:48:41.550
<v Speaker 1>I noticed you can't say it's not white and late night white and male cause they</v>

4405
01:48:41.551 --> 01:48:42.151
<v Speaker 1>want to make it white.</v>

4406
01:48:42.151 --> 01:48:42.361
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4407
01:48:42.361 --> 01:48:42.481
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4408
01:48:42.481 --> 01:48:43.231
<v Speaker 1>it's white and male.</v>

4409
01:48:43.231 --> 01:48:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Let's be real and but my thing is I'm not worried about late night.</v>

4410
01:48:47.170 --> 01:48:47.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to,</v>

4411
01:48:47.701 --> 01:48:51.690
<v Speaker 1>we need to stop focusing on getting a diversity in late night and the rest of us</v>

4412
01:48:51.691 --> 01:48:52.021
<v Speaker 1>need to do.</v>

4413
01:48:52.021 --> 01:48:55.470
<v Speaker 1>We always do find our own projects and create our own way and stop being the</v>

4414
01:48:55.471 --> 01:48:55.800
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

4415
01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:58.950
<v Speaker 1>the way that this is a reaction to late night talk show that you like,</v>

4416
01:48:58.951 --> 01:48:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I want to just talk.</v>

4417
01:48:59.791 --> 01:49:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have to do a skit.</v>

4418
01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:02.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4419
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:06.000
<v Speaker 1>and then the Hollywood reporter said to Debbie,</v>

4420
01:49:06.010 --> 01:49:06.511
<v Speaker 1>come out bill.</v>

4421
01:49:06.511 --> 01:49:07.344
<v Speaker 1>Their headline was,</v>

4422
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:09.180
<v Speaker 1>it's time for a black host in late night.</v>

4423
01:49:09.190 --> 01:49:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

4424
01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:10.231
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>

4425
01:49:10.231 --> 01:49:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4426
01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:11.870
<v Speaker 1>that's not what you said.</v>

4427
01:49:12.170 --> 01:49:14.490
<v Speaker 1>How when I say love your tweet to it too,</v>

4428
01:49:14.910 --> 01:49:15.590
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>

4429
01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:15.891
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

4430
01:49:15.891 --> 01:49:17.460
<v Speaker 1>it's funny when I say,</v>

4431
01:49:17.461 --> 01:49:20.490
<v Speaker 1>did you ever notice people here because people here,</v>

4432
01:49:20.491 --> 01:49:21.810
<v Speaker 1>everything you know and love is wrong.</v>

4433
01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same thing you found out is when you go,</v>

4434
01:49:25.530 --> 01:49:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I wonder people here,</v>

4435
01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.140
<v Speaker 1>you're a racist.</v>

4436
01:49:28.170 --> 01:49:29.790
<v Speaker 1>But I thought it was particularly,</v>

4437
01:49:29.791 --> 01:49:32.580
<v Speaker 1>it was particularly shocking to me because I'm a white guy</v>

4438
01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:34.771
<v Speaker 1>and I'm saying,</v>

4439
01:49:34.771 --> 01:49:37.860
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of it is racism because are we pretending that racism isn't</v>

4440
01:49:37.890 --> 01:49:38.480
<v Speaker 1>real?</v>

4441
01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:41.100
<v Speaker 1>It's 300 fucking 50 million people in this country,</v>

4442
01:49:41.101 --> 01:49:41.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4443
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:44.040
<v Speaker 1>If there's 300 plus million people in this country,</v>

4444
01:49:44.190 --> 01:49:45.410
<v Speaker 1>what percentage are racist?</v>

4445
01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 1>If it's 1% let's say it's 1%</v>

4446
01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:51.190
<v Speaker 2>we have more than 3 million racists.</v>

4447
01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4448
01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:56.820
<v Speaker 2>We know it's more than 1% so what percentage has a hard time dealing with a</v>

4449
01:49:56.861 --> 01:50:01.861
<v Speaker 2>dominant male athlete in a combat sport that beats the fuck out of everybody and</v>

4450
01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:04.330
<v Speaker 2>is like young and brash.</v>

4451
01:50:04.590 --> 01:50:08.720
<v Speaker 1>So has the thing that there been comparisons of John Jones to Ali young only in</v>

4452
01:50:08.730 --> 01:50:11.580
<v Speaker 1>this he has the same thing all he had where he's considered to be an outsider to</v>

4453
01:50:11.581 --> 01:50:12.414
<v Speaker 1>the sport.</v>

4454
01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:15.150
<v Speaker 1>You know that there's a thing with Jon Jones where it's like he came there,</v>

4455
01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:16.860
<v Speaker 1>the stuff I've heard about Jon Jones is that he's,</v>

4456
01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:18.780
<v Speaker 1>he's unorthodox or he's not,</v>

4457
01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:21.540
<v Speaker 1>he didn't come up the way he learned on youtube videos.</v>

4458
01:50:21.541 --> 01:50:22.100
<v Speaker 1>There's sort of this,</v>

4459
01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:22.570
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

4460
01:50:22.570 --> 01:50:24.150
<v Speaker 1>this legend that has been created about him,</v>

4461
01:50:24.151 --> 01:50:26.310
<v Speaker 1>about like that he's not that the sport,</v>

4462
01:50:26.670 --> 01:50:27.810
<v Speaker 1>but he's not a guy like,</v>

4463
01:50:27.811 --> 01:50:28.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4464
01:50:28.410 --> 01:50:31.680
<v Speaker 1>I dunno like you think about like a George Saint Pierre George Saint Pierre.</v>

4465
01:50:31.681 --> 01:50:31.831
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4466
01:50:31.831 --> 01:50:32.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of the black guy.</v>

4467
01:50:33.210 --> 01:50:34.110
<v Speaker 1>The guy had Jon Jones,</v>

4468
01:50:34.111 --> 01:50:37.470
<v Speaker 1>they were friends and then he'd beat her shot Rashad Evans who sorta was raised</v>

4469
01:50:37.471 --> 01:50:39.510
<v Speaker 1>by the sport through the ultimate fighter.</v>

4470
01:50:39.630 --> 01:50:41.220
<v Speaker 1>And so people got to see him sort of like,</v>

4471
01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.330
<v Speaker 1>people got to feel like I saw that guy on the TV show and now,</v>

4472
01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:45.480
<v Speaker 1>now he's our champion.</v>

4473
01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Whereas John Jones sort of came from the outside and very quickly dominated and</v>

4474
01:50:49.681 --> 01:50:50.820
<v Speaker 1>that threatens people sometimes</v>

4475
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:51.300
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

4476
01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:53.230
<v Speaker 2>well he actually see,</v>

4477
01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:57.120
<v Speaker 2>there's a misconception when it comes to martial arts and one of the big ones is</v>

4478
01:50:57.121 --> 01:50:58.710
<v Speaker 2>that wrestling is not a martial art.</v>

4479
01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:03.210
<v Speaker 2>John was a very successful wrestler all throughout high school and college and</v>

4480
01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:06.420
<v Speaker 2>that is probably the most important martial art.</v>

4481
01:51:06.630 --> 01:51:09.600
<v Speaker 2>The ability to dictate where the fight takes place is probably the most</v>

4482
01:51:09.601 --> 01:51:10.860
<v Speaker 2>important aspect of fighting.</v>

4483
01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:13.920
<v Speaker 2>And John was an outstanding wrestler and the only reason why he didn't go on to</v>

4484
01:51:13.921 --> 01:51:14.880
<v Speaker 2>be a college star,</v>

4485
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.340
<v Speaker 2>because he got his girlfriend pregnant and had to get a job.</v>

4486
01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:19.110
<v Speaker 2>That is why he got,</v>

4487
01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:23.520
<v Speaker 2>but he was being actively recruited by a bunch of different universities because</v>

4488
01:51:23.521 --> 01:51:24.780
<v Speaker 2>he was a very talented wrestler.</v>

4489
01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:27.060
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that,</v>

4490
01:51:27.150 --> 01:51:31.230
<v Speaker 2>he grew up with two fucking giant super athlete brothers.</v>

4491
01:51:31.590 --> 01:51:33.390
<v Speaker 2>And he used to Duke it out all the time.</v>

4492
01:51:33.690 --> 01:51:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Like John's parents would laugh about how their,</v>

4493
01:51:35.971 --> 01:51:36.211
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

4494
01:51:36.211 --> 01:51:38.700
<v Speaker 2>their kids would just wrestle and fight in the living room.</v>

4495
01:51:38.970 --> 01:51:40.260
<v Speaker 2>And that is a reality.</v>

4496
01:51:40.261 --> 01:51:41.700
<v Speaker 2>If you grew up with big brothers,</v>

4497
01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:44.650
<v Speaker 2>you can use to combat in the household on a daily fucking base.</v>

4498
01:51:44.651 --> 01:51:45.750
<v Speaker 2>You got to fight for cereal.</v>

4499
01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Like this fucking dude took your basketball,</v>

4500
01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:49.260
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

4501
01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:49.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4502
01:51:49.591 --> 01:51:50.580
<v Speaker 2>someone's got your shit,</v>

4503
01:51:50.610 --> 01:51:53.100
<v Speaker 2>you got to Duke it out and got a flight to go to the bathroom.</v>

4504
01:51:53.101 --> 01:51:53.430
<v Speaker 2>You to,</v>

4505
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4506
01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:55.230
<v Speaker 2>And even if it's not a real fight,</v>

4507
01:51:55.290 --> 01:51:57.810
<v Speaker 2>there's competition like high level competition.</v>

4508
01:51:57.811 --> 01:51:59.640
<v Speaker 2>So when he came out of nowhere,</v>

4509
01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:03.870
<v Speaker 2>he was still a very good athlete and a very good wrestler.</v>

4510
01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:06.420
<v Speaker 2>And wrestling is a hugely important martial art.</v>

4511
01:52:06.510 --> 01:52:11.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's no more unusual than a guy who's a worldclass kickboxer who enters into</v>

4512
01:52:11.881 --> 01:52:12.241
<v Speaker 2>MMA,</v>

4513
01:52:12.241 --> 01:52:13.440
<v Speaker 2>starts knocking people out.</v>

4514
01:52:13.441 --> 01:52:13.801
<v Speaker 2>That's Kinda,</v>

4515
01:52:13.801 --> 01:52:14.970
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda to be expected.</v>

4516
01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:16.710
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's just a mistake.</v>

4517
01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:17.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4518
01:52:17.451 --> 01:52:17.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it,</v>

4519
01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:19.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely like he's the,</v>

4520
01:52:19.630 --> 01:52:20.170
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

4521
01:52:20.170 --> 01:52:21.003
<v Speaker 1>you're black,</v>

4522
01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.020
<v Speaker 1>you're better than everybody and you,</v>

4523
01:52:23.110 --> 01:52:26.000
<v Speaker 1>you didn't come up the way we want you to have come up into this sport.</v>

4524
01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:26.541
<v Speaker 1>Why don't,</v>

4525
01:52:26.541 --> 01:52:26.721
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

4526
01:52:26.721 --> 01:52:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

4527
01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:29.180
<v Speaker 1>That's where we disagree.</v>

4528
01:52:29.210 --> 01:52:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4529
01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:29.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4530
01:52:29.791 --> 01:52:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

4531
01:52:30.110 --> 01:52:31.460
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that was the thing that I've,</v>

4532
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:33.650
<v Speaker 1>when I first heard about Jon Jones was that there was this,</v>

4533
01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:35.650
<v Speaker 1>the myth was created that like,</v>

4534
01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:35.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4535
01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:37.580
<v Speaker 1>he learned from watching youtube videos.</v>

4536
01:52:37.581 --> 01:52:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I remember hearing shit like that you didn't learn very quickly,</v>

4537
01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:43.820
<v Speaker 1>very quickly and people kind of don't like when,</v>

4538
01:52:43.821 --> 01:52:47.030
<v Speaker 1>so this is a thing we tell it like it was like with the young cash with Cassius</v>

4539
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Clay,</v>

4540
01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:51.140
<v Speaker 1>when somebody is so young and so much better than everybody,</v>

4541
01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:53.420
<v Speaker 1>and then you put the black thing on top of that.</v>

4542
01:52:53.421 --> 01:52:55.580
<v Speaker 1>He might've got that if he was white and so much better than everybody.</v>

4543
01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:55.940
<v Speaker 1>They kind of,</v>

4544
01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:56.271
<v Speaker 1>they get,</v>

4545
01:52:56.271 --> 01:52:59.510
<v Speaker 1>they sorta getting threatened by that and then you put black on top of it.</v>

4546
01:52:59.511 --> 01:53:01.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a recipe for a America.</v>

4547
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4548
01:53:02.481 --> 01:53:02.840
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

4549
01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:05.630
<v Speaker 1>And then if we can find some faults in your character.</v>

4550
01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>

4551
01:53:06.150 --> 01:53:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Was he drinking and driving history as a,</v>

4552
01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:12.560
<v Speaker 1>as a professional athlete or is it especially in a combat sport?</v>

4553
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:13.130
<v Speaker 1>All you,</v>

4554
01:53:13.130 --> 01:53:13.970
<v Speaker 1>all the guys are,</v>

4555
01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:14.660
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>

4556
01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:17.080
<v Speaker 1>this is not the polite thing.</v>

4557
01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4558
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:18.530
<v Speaker 1>You want,</v>

4559
01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:20.120
<v Speaker 1>you actually want your fighters to be bad.</v>

4560
01:53:20.121 --> 01:53:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Asses who drink and get in fights and do something,</v>

4561
01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:23.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4562
01:53:23.541 --> 01:53:23.790
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

4563
01:53:23.790 --> 01:53:24.330
<v Speaker 1>that's to me,</v>

4564
01:53:24.330 --> 01:53:24.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4565
01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:26.300
<v Speaker 1>to fault him for that is ridiculous.</v>

4566
01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:29.930
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to find a bad ass that doesn't do that.</v>

4567
01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:30.321
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4568
01:53:30.321 --> 01:53:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4569
01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:31.790
<v Speaker 1>Like Donald's Serone,</v>

4570
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:34.310
<v Speaker 1>who's one of the best fighters in the UFC,</v>

4571
01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:34.941
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

4572
01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:35.720
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

4573
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:38.150
<v Speaker 1>he's a real fucking crazy wild man.</v>

4574
01:53:38.151 --> 01:53:40.370
<v Speaker 1>His name's cowboys nicknames cowboy.</v>

4575
01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Where's the fucking cowboy hat?</v>

4576
01:53:41.571 --> 01:53:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere literally was a bull rider and drinks beer up until the day of the</v>

4577
01:53:46.041 --> 01:53:46.874
<v Speaker 1>weigh ins.</v>

4578
01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4579
01:53:47.690 --> 01:53:51.350
<v Speaker 1>D takes the day off to weigh in and then after the winds will have a beer,</v>

4580
01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:53.270
<v Speaker 1>like the day before it's fucking fight.</v>

4581
01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:55.640
<v Speaker 1>And in between fights,</v>

4582
01:53:55.820 --> 01:53:57.230
<v Speaker 1>he's jet skiing,</v>

4583
01:53:57.260 --> 01:53:58.170
<v Speaker 1>wakeboarding,</v>

4584
01:53:58.171 --> 01:53:59.630
<v Speaker 1>and he's a wild motherfucker,</v>

4585
01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:02.120
<v Speaker 1>but he's a white dude.</v>

4586
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:05.990
<v Speaker 1>So like all this talk about him drinking and he's never like crash a car.</v>

4587
01:54:05.991 --> 01:54:07.070
<v Speaker 1>He's not married.</v>

4588
01:54:07.071 --> 01:54:07.850
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have,</v>

4589
01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:08.151
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

4590
01:54:08.151 --> 01:54:10.640
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of shit that John was like involved in that,</v>

4591
01:54:10.670 --> 01:54:13.060
<v Speaker 1>that gave people an excuse to be upset enough.</v>

4592
01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:14.620
<v Speaker 1>They gave him an excuse because if,</v>

4593
01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:15.471
<v Speaker 1>if they liked him,</v>

4594
01:54:15.471 --> 01:54:17.120
<v Speaker 1>that stuff would be the things that made him like,</v>

4595
01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:17.241
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4596
01:54:17.241 --> 01:54:18.051
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad ass.</v>

4597
01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:18.950
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't give a shit.</v>

4598
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:22.170
<v Speaker 1>He's out there driving as Bentley and the trees like that.</v>

4599
01:54:22.190 --> 01:54:23.780
<v Speaker 1>That would be stuff that he was celebrated for.</v>

4600
01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:24.710
<v Speaker 1>If they liked him,</v>

4601
01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:25.310
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

4602
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:26.143
<v Speaker 1>if they liked him.</v>

4603
01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:27.560
<v Speaker 1>But I heard people say like,</v>

4604
01:54:27.590 --> 01:54:27.831
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4605
01:54:27.831 --> 01:54:28.611
<v Speaker 1>he's so fake.</v>

4606
01:54:28.611 --> 01:54:29.121
<v Speaker 1>He's so fake.</v>

4607
01:54:29.121 --> 01:54:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Like he's fucking 27 years old.</v>

4608
01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:34.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know who you were when you were 27 and if you were,</v>

4609
01:54:35.090 --> 01:54:37.550
<v Speaker 1>were you the fucking light heavyweight champion of the world?</v>

4610
01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:42.160
<v Speaker 1>We would have heard about the amount of pressure and the,</v>

4611
01:54:42.161 --> 01:54:42.411
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4612
01:54:42.411 --> 01:54:44.180
<v Speaker 1>just the scrutiny that he's under.</v>

4613
01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:45.590
<v Speaker 1>It's just unprecedented.</v>

4614
01:54:45.591 --> 01:54:45.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4615
01:54:45.771 --> 01:54:49.250
<v Speaker 1>and I think that it's a MMA at this point,</v>

4616
01:54:49.251 --> 01:54:50.084
<v Speaker 1>I think is a,</v>

4617
01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:51.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've,</v>

4618
01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:51.831
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if that,</v>

4619
01:54:51.831 --> 01:54:52.550
<v Speaker 1>if I was,</v>

4620
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:55.200
<v Speaker 1>if I ever made like sort of fuck you money or money to do,</v>

4621
01:54:55.490 --> 01:54:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I would open Jujitsu gyms in the ghetto to train the next generation of black</v>

4622
01:54:59.841 --> 01:55:02.430
<v Speaker 1>MMA fighters because I feel like there's guys in there who could be,</v>

4623
01:55:02.670 --> 01:55:04.460
<v Speaker 1>it remains a very white sport right now.</v>

4624
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Now black guys historically have been fighters like it,</v>

4625
01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:07.880
<v Speaker 1>professional boxers,</v>

4626
01:55:08.150 --> 01:55:09.230
<v Speaker 1>but professional boxing guts,</v>

4627
01:55:09.231 --> 01:55:11.090
<v Speaker 1>so corrupt that the strongest,</v>

4628
01:55:11.091 --> 01:55:13.130
<v Speaker 1>toughest black gang out in that place for the NFL.</v>

4629
01:55:13.131 --> 01:55:13.521
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't,</v>

4630
01:55:13.521 --> 01:55:14.354
<v Speaker 1>he's not a boxer.</v>

4631
01:55:14.570 --> 01:55:16.040
<v Speaker 1>He's not a heavy heavyweight field though.</v>

4632
01:55:16.190 --> 01:55:18.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there'll be a black heavyweight champion really ever again.</v>

4633
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Really Nice.</v>

4634
01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:22.760
<v Speaker 1>You say that just because you know who Deontay Wilders?</v>

4635
01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:23.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4636
01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:24.770
<v Speaker 1>no bad motherfucker.</v>

4637
01:55:25.130 --> 01:55:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I hope they're being undefeated heavyweight and just smashing people.</v>

4638
01:55:28.491 --> 01:55:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

4639
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:29.810
<v Speaker 1>big tall,</v>

4640
01:55:29.811 --> 01:55:30.321
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

4641
01:55:30.321 --> 01:55:31.520
<v Speaker 1>lanky dude who's got,</v>

4642
01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:31.700
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4643
01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I think he's all knockouts.</v>

4644
01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:34.513
<v Speaker 1>Record is just,</v>

4645
01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.230
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy that got famous recently because there was some crazy fuck who was on</v>

4646
01:55:39.231 --> 01:55:41.780
<v Speaker 1>the Internet who's talking all kinds of crazy shit to him.</v>

4647
01:55:41.781 --> 01:55:44.310
<v Speaker 1>And so he met him in a ring and beat the shit out.</v>

4648
01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:45.930
<v Speaker 1>You didn't see that.</v>

4649
01:55:45.930 --> 01:55:46.111
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4650
01:55:46.111 --> 01:55:46.231
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4651
01:55:46.231 --> 01:55:46.831
<v Speaker 1>I got to see that.</v>

4652
01:55:46.831 --> 01:55:47.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4653
01:55:47.191 --> 01:55:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Some crazy guy who said some fucked up things about his daughter and beat the</v>

4654
01:55:52.051 --> 01:55:53.170
<v Speaker 1>fuck out of him in a,</v>

4655
01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:55.650
<v Speaker 1>in a video that was on TMZ and everything.</v>

4656
01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:56.181
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4657
01:55:56.181 --> 01:55:56.550
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4658
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:57.301
<v Speaker 1>I just think that there's,</v>

4659
01:55:57.301 --> 01:56:00.510
<v Speaker 1>the culture of professional boxing in this country has changed in the black</v>

4660
01:56:00.511 --> 01:56:01.500
<v Speaker 1>community that I think,</v>

4661
01:56:01.770 --> 01:56:02.760
<v Speaker 1>I think people,</v>

4662
01:56:02.761 --> 01:56:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a sense of like if Mike Tyson had vendor Holyfield and ended up</v>

4663
01:56:05.491 --> 01:56:06.324
<v Speaker 1>broke,</v>

4664
01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:07.800
<v Speaker 1>what chance do I stand?</v>

4665
01:56:08.050 --> 01:56:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather has untold amounts of money.</v>

4666
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:12.890
<v Speaker 1>It's my time management,</v>

4667
01:56:12.891 --> 01:56:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I shit it is for now.</v>

4668
01:56:16.250 --> 01:56:16.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4669
01:56:16.770 --> 01:56:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not trying,</v>

4670
01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get a war with Floyd Mayweather started,</v>

4671
01:56:20.101 --> 01:56:25.050
<v Speaker 1>but I just feel like who had Mike Tyson had untold amounts of money.</v>

4672
01:56:25.170 --> 01:56:25.381
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

4673
01:56:25.381 --> 01:56:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Mayweather has more because of his airplane mode,</v>

4674
01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:29.820
<v Speaker 1>but Mike Tyson,</v>

4675
01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:33.270
<v Speaker 1>who Mike Tyson and Holyfield head untold amount of money at the time and they're</v>

4676
01:56:33.271 --> 01:56:34.104
<v Speaker 1>both,</v>

4677
01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

4678
01:56:34.710 --> 01:56:35.401
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they're living,</v>

4679
01:56:35.401 --> 01:56:36.780
<v Speaker 1>but they're not living the way they were.</v>

4680
01:56:36.810 --> 01:56:38.040
<v Speaker 1>But that's a management issue.</v>

4681
01:56:38.070 --> 01:56:38.461
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't been.</v>

4682
01:56:38.461 --> 01:56:39.680
<v Speaker 1>But I think the problem is is you come in,</v>

4683
01:56:39.681 --> 01:56:40.920
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing we talked about earlier.</v>

4684
01:56:41.070 --> 01:56:41.903
<v Speaker 1>You come out of the,</v>

4685
01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:43.230
<v Speaker 1>the bad neighborhood,</v>

4686
01:56:43.231 --> 01:56:43.441
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4687
01:56:43.441 --> 01:56:43.950
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

4688
01:56:43.950 --> 01:56:44.281
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4689
01:56:44.281 --> 01:56:44.880
<v Speaker 1>you learn,</v>

4690
01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:45.211
<v Speaker 1>they learn.</v>

4691
01:56:45.211 --> 01:56:45.840
<v Speaker 1>You're an athlete.</v>

4692
01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:46.860
<v Speaker 1>They don't teach you the rest.</v>

4693
01:56:46.861 --> 01:56:48.840
<v Speaker 1>They don't teach you like how to be a good manager to that.</v>

4694
01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:50.130
<v Speaker 1>You're signing with a,</v>

4695
01:56:50.131 --> 01:56:51.180
<v Speaker 1>with a boxing manager,</v>

4696
01:56:51.181 --> 01:56:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Don king who just like,</v>

4697
01:56:52.201 --> 01:56:53.460
<v Speaker 1>just sign this blank piece of paper.</v>

4698
01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:54.293
<v Speaker 1>I'll take care of it.</v>

4699
01:56:54.630 --> 01:56:55.411
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

4700
01:56:55.411 --> 01:56:57.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a recurring process that happens and that thing,</v>

4701
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:59.340
<v Speaker 1>whereas at least if you go to the NFL,</v>

4702
01:56:59.341 --> 01:57:00.360
<v Speaker 1>you get a contract,</v>

4703
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:03.360
<v Speaker 1>you get an actual thing that we're going to pay you this much and it's not</v>

4704
01:57:03.361 --> 01:57:03.991
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed.</v>

4705
01:57:03.991 --> 01:57:04.651
<v Speaker 1>Or if you go to the NBA,</v>

4706
01:57:04.651 --> 01:57:05.850
<v Speaker 1>you get a guaranteed contract.</v>

4707
01:57:06.090 --> 01:57:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Or my theory is that a lot of those dudes go,</v>

4708
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:10.670
<v Speaker 1>instead of going into a boxing ring and get my brains beat,</v>

4709
01:57:10.671 --> 01:57:13.440
<v Speaker 1>now I'm just going to hang out with the best basketball player in town and be</v>

4710
01:57:13.441 --> 01:57:14.850
<v Speaker 1>his NBN as posse.</v>

4711
01:57:14.910 --> 01:57:16.560
<v Speaker 1>You know that it doesn't pay as much,</v>

4712
01:57:16.561 --> 01:57:18.270
<v Speaker 1>but at least I'm not getting ripped off.</v>

4713
01:57:18.690 --> 01:57:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where's,</v>

4714
01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:21.000
<v Speaker 1>where's the [inaudible] champion?</v>

4715
01:57:21.970 --> 01:57:22.410
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4716
01:57:22.410 --> 01:57:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't black guys in boxing anymore or the why aren't there?</v>

4717
01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Why he used to be that it was a done deal that a black guy would be the</v>

4718
01:57:29.551 --> 01:57:30.210
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight champion.</v>

4719
01:57:30.210 --> 01:57:34.050
<v Speaker 1>There is a real problem and that problem is a six foot six Russian,</v>

4720
01:57:34.890 --> 01:57:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Klitschko who's one of the best boxers that heavyweight division's ever</v>

4721
01:57:38.431 --> 01:57:38.760
<v Speaker 1>known.</v>

4722
01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:39.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4723
01:57:39.091 --> 01:57:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Klitschko is up,</v>

4724
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not fucking,</v>

4725
01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:41.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in any way,</v>

4726
01:57:41.701 --> 01:57:42.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>

4727
01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:42.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4728
01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:43.553
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

4729
01:57:43.650 --> 01:57:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Who would've ever thought that we would be a white heavyweight champion that no</v>

4730
01:57:46.711 --> 01:57:47.940
<v Speaker 1>one gives a fuck about?</v>

4731
01:57:47.970 --> 01:57:48.840
<v Speaker 1>No one gives a fuck about,</v>

4732
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:51.360
<v Speaker 1>no one gives a fuck about the heavyweight champion.</v>

4733
01:57:51.361 --> 01:57:54.000
<v Speaker 1>He used to be the the most famous guy on the planet and that,</v>

4734
01:57:54.001 --> 01:57:56.130
<v Speaker 1>and that ended with when Lennox Lewis retired.</v>

4735
01:57:56.131 --> 01:57:56.461
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4736
01:57:56.461 --> 01:57:56.791
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

4737
01:57:56.791 --> 01:57:58.200
<v Speaker 1>I was on a fucking plane,</v>

4738
01:57:58.201 --> 01:58:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Klitschko and no one knew who he was.</v>

4739
01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about whether I should interrupt him and say hi and say I'm a big</v>

4740
01:58:04.471 --> 01:58:04.741
<v Speaker 1>fan.</v>

4741
01:58:04.741 --> 01:58:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Like that dude's probably so happy that no one's talking to him right now.</v>

4742
01:58:08.130 --> 01:58:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave him alone.</v>

4743
01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:10.470
<v Speaker 1>But then I realized no one was talking to him.</v>

4744
01:58:10.471 --> 01:58:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Nobody fucking talk to him.</v>

4745
01:58:12.050 --> 01:58:12.441
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

4746
01:58:12.441 --> 01:58:14.040
<v Speaker 1>that's a a shift.</v>

4747
01:58:14.041 --> 01:58:16.230
<v Speaker 1>The heavyweight champion used to be the most famous guy on the plane.</v>

4748
01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4749
01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:17.011
<v Speaker 1>My friend goes,</v>

4750
01:58:17.011 --> 01:58:17.311
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4751
01:58:17.311 --> 01:58:18.210
<v Speaker 1>that guy is fucking huge.</v>

4752
01:58:18.211 --> 01:58:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

4753
01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:20.280
<v Speaker 1>do you know that's a heavyweight boxing champion,</v>

4754
01:58:20.281 --> 01:58:20.521
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

4755
01:58:20.521 --> 01:58:20.701
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4756
01:58:20.701 --> 01:58:21.080
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

4757
01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4758
01:58:21.850 --> 01:58:22.683
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4759
01:58:23.130 --> 01:58:23.963
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4760
01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:24.973
<v Speaker 1>I got that.</v>

4761
01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:27.110
<v Speaker 1>That's Vladimir Klitschko now in Ukraine.</v>

4762
01:58:27.210 --> 01:58:27.811
<v Speaker 1>He would be,</v>

4763
01:58:27.811 --> 01:58:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he gets them up in Germany.</v>

4764
01:58:30.370 --> 01:58:32.340
<v Speaker 1>He actually speaks like five different languages.</v>

4765
01:58:32.341 --> 01:58:33.360
<v Speaker 1>He's a phd.</v>

4766
01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:34.800
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant guy.</v>

4767
01:58:34.801 --> 01:58:35.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4768
01:58:35.011 --> 01:58:38.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a really unique guy to be a heavyweight champion.</v>

4769
01:58:38.330 --> 01:58:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Him and his brother were heavyweight champions in the same time.</v>

4770
01:58:41.201 --> 01:58:41.711
<v Speaker 1>Didn't want to end.</v>

4771
01:58:41.711 --> 01:58:42.544
<v Speaker 1>Didn't fight each other.</v>

4772
01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:45.430
<v Speaker 1>It was so strange thing is so corrupt.</v>

4773
01:58:45.431 --> 01:58:45.971
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's like,</v>

4774
01:58:45.971 --> 01:58:46.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4775
01:58:46.241 --> 01:58:47.110
<v Speaker 1>why do you say that?</v>

4776
01:58:47.730 --> 01:58:48.040
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

4777
01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:48.490
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

4778
01:58:48.490 --> 01:58:48.661
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

4779
01:58:48.661 --> 01:58:49.990
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is corrupt about it?</v>

4780
01:58:50.410 --> 01:58:52.330
<v Speaker 1>I think no Shay statement.</v>

4781
01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.021
<v Speaker 1>Well here's what the,</v>

4782
01:58:53.021 --> 01:58:54.150
<v Speaker 1>here's why the value,</v>

4783
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:55.263
<v Speaker 1>I'll bring it to this.</v>

4784
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:58.090
<v Speaker 1>The UFC is doing a good job right now.</v>

4785
01:58:58.270 --> 01:59:02.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a central organization that has a series of practices and this is the way</v>

4786
01:59:02.261 --> 01:59:02.951
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it.</v>

4787
01:59:02.951 --> 01:59:03.271
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

4788
01:59:03.271 --> 01:59:03.690
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

4789
01:59:03.690 --> 01:59:04.370
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

4790
01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:06.070
<v Speaker 1>you can call it a monopoly if you want to,</v>

4791
01:59:06.071 --> 01:59:08.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's a centralized organization that runs everything.</v>

4792
01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Boxing is a bunch of different organizations that each set their own rules and</v>

4793
01:59:12.641 --> 01:59:12.970
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

4794
01:59:12.970 --> 01:59:14.230
<v Speaker 1>So there's not a way to go.</v>

4795
01:59:14.770 --> 01:59:16.340
<v Speaker 1>How do we make these fighters fight?</v>

4796
01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:19.750
<v Speaker 1>You can't avoid a fight if you're the best guy in the UFC and there's a number</v>

4797
01:59:19.751 --> 01:59:20.230
<v Speaker 1>two guy,</v>

4798
01:59:20.230 --> 01:59:21.063
<v Speaker 1>you guys are going to fight.</v>

4799
01:59:21.390 --> 01:59:21.940
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4800
01:59:21.940 --> 01:59:22.531
<v Speaker 1>But boxing,</v>

4801
01:59:22.531 --> 01:59:23.980
<v Speaker 1>cause there's a bunch of splinter organizations,</v>

4802
01:59:23.981 --> 01:59:24.760
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

4803
01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:27.790
<v Speaker 1>we never got to see Holyfield Tyson fight in their prime,</v>

4804
01:59:28.300 --> 01:59:28.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4805
01:59:28.691 --> 01:59:31.570
<v Speaker 1>because of Pacquiao and Mayweather because of all the,</v>

4806
01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:32.880
<v Speaker 1>all the back water deal.</v>

4807
01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:33.850
<v Speaker 1>People are trying to keep the,</v>

4808
01:59:33.851 --> 01:59:34.990
<v Speaker 1>protect their side of it.</v>

4809
01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:38.140
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't want him to fight that guy because if he loses then we lose all</v>

4810
01:59:38.141 --> 01:59:38.561
<v Speaker 1>our things.</v>

4811
01:59:38.561 --> 01:59:39.040
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

4812
01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:40.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not what's good for the sport.</v>

4813
01:59:40.361 --> 01:59:42.940
<v Speaker 1>It's what's good for the bottom line and the dollar and what the,</v>

4814
01:59:43.180 --> 01:59:46.420
<v Speaker 1>and so therefore it leads to corruption and it leads select things that happened</v>

4815
01:59:46.421 --> 01:59:46.691
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

4816
01:59:46.691 --> 01:59:47.860
<v Speaker 1>why aren't these fights happening?</v>

4817
01:59:47.861 --> 01:59:48.300
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

4818
01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:49.960
<v Speaker 1>and also the thing with Don King,</v>

4819
01:59:50.050 --> 01:59:50.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4820
01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:52.240
<v Speaker 1>he Tyson will tell,</v>

4821
01:59:52.241 --> 01:59:52.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4822
01:59:52.451 --> 01:59:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you to,</v>

4823
01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I talked to my Tyson before then don king became the biggest promoter because he</v>

4824
01:59:56.831 --> 01:59:58.600
<v Speaker 1>was ripping everybody the fuck off.</v>

4825
01:59:59.110 --> 02:00:02.740
<v Speaker 1>And so there's no central authority to rule over and say,</v>

4826
02:00:02.741 --> 02:00:05.860
<v Speaker 1>we have to clean this up so and so and so.</v>

4827
02:00:05.861 --> 02:00:07.240
<v Speaker 1>It leads to a lot of corruption.</v>

4828
02:00:07.390 --> 02:00:08.230
<v Speaker 1>And it leads to,</v>

4829
02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:11.470
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason that Mike Tyson should be broke right now.</v>

4830
02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Despite all the shit he went through.</v>

4831
02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:14.073
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason.</v>

4832
02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:15.400
<v Speaker 1>That's where I disagree with you.</v>

4833
02:00:15.401 --> 02:00:18.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't attribute that to to corruption and neither does he.</v>

4834
02:00:18.730 --> 02:00:20.290
<v Speaker 1>He just went crazy and spent all his money.</v>

4835
02:00:20.291 --> 02:00:25.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean he has a fucking one man Broadway show where he talks about shows 350</v>

4836
02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:25.481
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

4837
02:00:25.481 --> 02:00:25.721
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4838
02:00:25.721 --> 02:00:26.020
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

4839
02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:27.170
<v Speaker 1>I spent that much,</v>

4840
02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:28.720
<v Speaker 1>but he's he,</v>

4841
02:00:28.750 --> 02:00:29.830
<v Speaker 1>he did spend that much,</v>

4842
02:00:29.831 --> 02:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>but he also,</v>

4843
02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:31.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure would tell you,</v>

4844
02:00:31.631 --> 02:00:33.490
<v Speaker 1>and that somebody also too,</v>

4845
02:00:33.491 --> 02:00:36.160
<v Speaker 1>that somebody else took millions of dollars from him that they weren't supposed</v>

4846
02:00:36.161 --> 02:00:36.430
<v Speaker 1>to have.</v>

4847
02:00:36.430 --> 02:00:37.091
<v Speaker 1>They okay.</v>

4848
02:00:37.091 --> 02:00:37.811
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>

4849
02:00:37.811 --> 02:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Someone stole money from him.</v>

4850
02:00:39.071 --> 02:00:39.581
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

4851
02:00:39.581 --> 02:00:40.450
<v Speaker 1>if he had that money,</v>

4852
02:00:40.451 --> 02:00:41.320
<v Speaker 1>he would spend it too.</v>

4853
02:00:41.610 --> 02:00:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Well I would,</v>

4854
02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:42.850
<v Speaker 1>I wish I would.</v>

4855
02:00:42.850 --> 02:00:44.200
<v Speaker 1>I would like to give him the chance to spend it.</v>

4856
02:00:44.201 --> 02:00:47.290
<v Speaker 1>That's all I would have liked to have been with someone who is a financial</v>

4857
02:00:47.291 --> 02:00:50.440
<v Speaker 1>advisor who would have set some money aside very early on.</v>

4858
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:52.360
<v Speaker 1>And you know as [inaudible] has that.</v>

4859
02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:53.351
<v Speaker 1>Yes he does.</v>

4860
02:00:53.351 --> 02:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4861
02:00:53.730 --> 02:00:57.670
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about that recently and Iverson turns 50 he gets millions of</v>

4862
02:00:57.670 --> 02:00:57.671
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>

4863
02:00:57.671 --> 02:00:58.271
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars.</v>

4864
02:00:58.271 --> 02:00:59.104
<v Speaker 1>So he's just,</v>

4865
02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:00.130
<v Speaker 1>he's just working for the,</v>

4866
02:01:00.131 --> 02:01:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I think for the 70 sixers until that kicks in.</v>

4867
02:01:03.191 --> 02:01:07.510
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that the Michael Jordan sort of established the modern NBA of</v>

4868
02:01:07.511 --> 02:01:07.721
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4869
02:01:07.721 --> 02:01:07.871
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4870
02:01:07.871 --> 02:01:11.230
<v Speaker 1>get a money manager and get a guy who protects your things and don't invest in</v>

4871
02:01:11.231 --> 02:01:11.681
<v Speaker 1>stupid shit.</v>

4872
02:01:11.681 --> 02:01:13.240
<v Speaker 1>And so some people will end up broke,</v>

4873
02:01:13.450 --> 02:01:15.370
<v Speaker 1>but you think that the NFL is corrupt.</v>

4874
02:01:15.371 --> 02:01:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the NBA is corrupt?</v>

4875
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Not In the way that boxing is curled because this way cause a you 80% of NFL</v>

4876
02:01:22.271 --> 02:01:25.090
<v Speaker 1>players within two years or bankrupt after they retire.</v>

4877
02:01:25.390 --> 02:01:26.223
<v Speaker 1>80% yes.</v>

4878
02:01:26.230 --> 02:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>60 something percent of NBA player.</v>

4879
02:01:28.591 --> 02:01:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

4880
02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Bankrupt within two years of retirement.</v>

4881
02:01:31.150 --> 02:01:34.600
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think it's an issue of corruption when it comes to how much money</v>

4882
02:01:34.601 --> 02:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>they blow,</v>

4883
02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:37.630
<v Speaker 1>as much as they get that money,</v>

4884
02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:39.620
<v Speaker 1>it's flowing in like a river.</v>

4885
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.080
<v Speaker 1>The ESPN documentary broke.</v>

4886
02:01:42.210 --> 02:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4887
02:01:42.570 --> 02:01:43.403
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say it.</v>

4888
02:01:43.490 --> 02:01:43.941
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>

4889
02:01:43.941 --> 02:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>it's about,</v>

4890
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>it's about that.</v>

4891
02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4892
02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:46.850
<v Speaker 1>Guy like Mike Tyson was,</v>

4893
02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:48.980
<v Speaker 1>grew up in Brownsville,</v>

4894
02:01:48.981 --> 02:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>poor as hell.</v>

4895
02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden he has hundreds of millions of dollars.</v>

4896
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>He's got,</v>

4897
02:01:53.930 --> 02:01:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Tiger's Charlie Murphy came on my podcast until the fucking story about Mike</v>

4898
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Tyson about showing up at Mike Tyson,</v>

4899
02:02:00.730 --> 02:02:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson in the front lawn plane with a tiger.</v>

4900
02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>So he had a fucking tight,</v>

4901
02:02:04.581 --> 02:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>nobody would get out of the car.</v>

4902
02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Everybody stayed in their car.</v>

4903
02:02:08.570 --> 02:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Here's my thing,</v>

4904
02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>the corruption leads to people not wanting to participate in the sport in the</v>

4905
02:02:12.381 --> 02:02:12.860
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>

4906
02:02:12.860 --> 02:02:13.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what I believe.</v>

4907
02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so man.</v>

4908
02:02:15.590 --> 02:02:16.480
<v Speaker 1>I just think that the,</v>

4909
02:02:16.530 --> 02:02:17.211
<v Speaker 1>that you go,</v>

4910
02:02:17.211 --> 02:02:21.170
<v Speaker 1>why don't I have used to be a football player looking at it in terms of this</v>

4911
02:02:21.171 --> 02:02:22.250
<v Speaker 1>longterm thing.</v>

4912
02:02:22.251 --> 02:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I think there's less people that are getting involved in boxing first of all,</v>

4913
02:02:25.311 --> 02:02:27.140
<v Speaker 1>because more people are getting involved in MMA.</v>

4914
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing that's definitely happening,</v>

4915
02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>but black more black dudes aren't getting involved.</v>

4916
02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe starting to,</v>

4917
02:02:32.630 --> 02:02:33.463
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't the,</v>

4918
02:02:33.770 --> 02:02:34.320
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

4919
02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:34.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4920
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:35.470
<v Speaker 1>there was a disk,</v>

4921
02:02:35.470 --> 02:02:36.100
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

4922
02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:40.160
<v Speaker 1>a gulf between the end of boxing being a big sport then of heavyweight champions</v>

4923
02:02:40.161 --> 02:02:43.250
<v Speaker 1>being a big thing and in the MMA taking prominence and that,</v>

4924
02:02:43.251 --> 02:02:43.701
<v Speaker 1>what was it,</v>

4925
02:02:43.701 --> 02:02:44.900
<v Speaker 1>what happened in that Gulf?</v>

4926
02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Like between Lennox Lewis going,</v>

4927
02:02:46.731 --> 02:02:50.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm out in between and to John Jones there's like a Gulf of like where did all</v>

4928
02:02:50.781 --> 02:02:51.280
<v Speaker 1>the black,</v>

4929
02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:51.490
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>

4930
02:02:51.490 --> 02:02:52.670
<v Speaker 1>old black heavyweight champions go.</v>

4931
02:02:52.671 --> 02:02:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Where'd all the black dudes who are going to be here?</v>

4932
02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:57.680
<v Speaker 1>But there was still a lot of black fighters in the lower weight classes.</v>

4933
02:02:57.681 --> 02:02:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Like that was Roy Jones was still around.</v>

4934
02:02:59.571 --> 02:03:00.381
<v Speaker 1>There's Hopkins,</v>

4935
02:03:00.381 --> 02:03:01.214
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking about</v>

4936
02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:05.270
<v Speaker 1>the heavyweight champion was the baddest motherfucker on the planet.</v>

4937
02:03:05.271 --> 02:03:08.540
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find really big dudes that are willing to get punched in the face.</v>

4938
02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:08.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4939
02:03:08.841 --> 02:03:13.370
<v Speaker 1>that's your thing is boxing is just so fucking hard to do in comparison to other</v>

4940
02:03:13.371 --> 02:03:16.310
<v Speaker 1>sports like football because not that football's not hard to do,</v>

4941
02:03:16.311 --> 02:03:17.430
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

4942
02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:20.450
<v Speaker 1>you could be a great football player and never have the courage to be able to</v>

4943
02:03:20.451 --> 02:03:23.340
<v Speaker 1>step into a ring on your own and your underwear and go toe to toe with a gun.</v>

4944
02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Cause you could,</v>

4945
02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:24.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4946
02:03:24.621 --> 02:03:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Bob could fucking drop the ball and you can lose the game and you can still go</v>

4947
02:03:27.801 --> 02:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>out and party.</v>

4948
02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:29.750
<v Speaker 1>But if you get your ass kicked,</v>

4949
02:03:29.751 --> 02:03:30.950
<v Speaker 1>you got your fucking ass kid.</v>

4950
02:03:30.980 --> 02:03:31.731
<v Speaker 1>You did it,</v>

4951
02:03:31.731 --> 02:03:32.690
<v Speaker 1>it's all on you.</v>

4952
02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4953
02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:35.690
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are not psychologically bill for that.</v>

4954
02:03:35.730 --> 02:03:36.141
<v Speaker 1>We'll that.</v>

4955
02:03:36.141 --> 02:03:37.520
<v Speaker 1>But that's the thing I think is interesting.</v>

4956
02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:42.320
<v Speaker 1>For years they were up through up through a Holyfield and Tyson.</v>

4957
02:03:42.321 --> 02:03:42.591
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

4958
02:03:42.591 --> 02:03:43.620
<v Speaker 1>and then some what,</v>

4959
02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:44.631
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

4960
02:03:44.631 --> 02:03:46.730
<v Speaker 1>some of those dudes are getting concussions in the NFL,</v>

4961
02:03:46.731 --> 02:03:46.881
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4962
02:03:46.881 --> 02:03:47.150
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4963
02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4964
02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:48.313
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

4965
02:03:48.410 --> 02:03:49.243
<v Speaker 1>I just think there's,</v>

4966
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:50.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4967
02:03:50.290 --> 02:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>that's my theory about it.</v>

4968
02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I certainly don't you right.</v>

4969
02:03:52.730 --> 02:03:53.563
<v Speaker 1>But I just feel like this,</v>

4970
02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:56.840
<v Speaker 1>the culture of the sport became so corrupt that I don't think people,</v>

4971
02:03:56.990 --> 02:03:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I see where you're coming from,</v>

4972
02:03:58.161 --> 02:04:01.490
<v Speaker 1>but I really honestly don't think that it's coming from a point of like,</v>

4973
02:04:01.550 --> 02:04:02.150
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4974
02:04:02.150 --> 02:04:03.140
<v Speaker 1>we've seen the future.</v>

4975
02:04:03.141 --> 02:04:04.220
<v Speaker 1>This is where this ends up.</v>

4976
02:04:04.221 --> 02:04:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Let's not do this.</v>

4977
02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:05.271
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4978
02:04:05.271 --> 02:04:05.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

4979
02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:06.351
<v Speaker 1>And that's why the future.</v>

4980
02:04:06.351 --> 02:04:08.270
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's a sense that like if you're a kid,</v>

4981
02:04:08.271 --> 02:04:10.370
<v Speaker 1>if you're a kid who's six foot three,</v>

4982
02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:12.290
<v Speaker 1>two 50 and you go,</v>

4983
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.651
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4984
02:04:12.651 --> 02:04:14.300
<v Speaker 1>do I want to be a,</v>

4985
02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:18.650
<v Speaker 1>do I want to be a basketball player like Lebron James or Michael Jordan or Kobe,</v>

4986
02:04:18.651 --> 02:04:19.070
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4987
02:04:19.070 --> 02:04:19.910
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be a boxer,</v>

4988
02:04:19.911 --> 02:04:21.020
<v Speaker 1>like a Vanderhoof fit or my,</v>

4989
02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait a second it dudes are broke.</v>

4990
02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

4991
02:04:24.530 --> 02:04:26.720
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't have to be broke man.</v>

4992
02:04:26.721 --> 02:04:27.554
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

4993
02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:29.181
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

4994
02:04:29.181 --> 02:04:33.080
<v Speaker 1>They are the nuts and more importantly than broke his brain damage.</v>

4995
02:04:33.110 --> 02:04:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that is the most intelligent thing to avoid.</v>

4996
02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4997
02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that as one thing,</v>

4998
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:40.410
<v Speaker 1>as different economic groups,</v>

4999
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5000
02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:42.900
<v Speaker 1>excel in the culture,</v>

5001
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:44.730
<v Speaker 1>they become less likely to be fighters.</v>

5002
02:04:44.850 --> 02:04:46.940
<v Speaker 1>That is one thing that happens on a pretty,</v>

5003
02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:48.180
<v Speaker 1>pretty consistent basis.</v>

5004
02:04:48.450 --> 02:04:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Whoever on the bottom of the economic it.</v>

5005
02:04:50.050 --> 02:04:51.170
<v Speaker 1>That's why it was Irish dudes.</v>

5006
02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5007
02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:54.720
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's Italian for awhile.</v>

5008
02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:56.100
<v Speaker 1>It's also boxing.</v>

5009
02:04:56.101 --> 02:04:57.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like brain damage.</v>

5010
02:04:57.630 --> 02:04:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Fucking unavoidable.</v>

5011
02:04:58.740 --> 02:04:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5012
02:04:59.190 --> 02:04:59.731
<v Speaker 1>And you can't,</v>

5013
02:04:59.731 --> 02:05:01.170
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it for long without,</v>

5014
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think Lennox Lewis got out when he was like,</v>

5015
02:05:03.031 --> 02:05:03.211
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5016
02:05:03.211 --> 02:05:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I've beaten everybody at this point.</v>

5017
02:05:05.131 --> 02:05:07.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to be about taking too many hits to the head.</v>

5018
02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:07.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5019
02:05:07.951 --> 02:05:08.850
<v Speaker 1>And very smart.</v>

5020
02:05:08.851 --> 02:05:11.010
<v Speaker 1>And he's shown a little bit of deterioration now.</v>

5021
02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:12.380
<v Speaker 1>How could you not you can't you,</v>

5022
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:13.110
<v Speaker 1>how could you not?</v>

5023
02:05:13.110 --> 02:05:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Nobody rides for free.</v>

5024
02:05:13.980 --> 02:05:15.150
<v Speaker 1>That was a big boxing fan.</v>

5025
02:05:15.151 --> 02:05:15.570
<v Speaker 1>So I just,</v>

5026
02:05:15.570 --> 02:05:19.620
<v Speaker 1>I sort of missed the fact that the heavyweight title was like an event,</v>

5027
02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:20.930
<v Speaker 1>like wouldn't use like this.</v>

5028
02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't then you,</v>

5029
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:22.620
<v Speaker 1>everybody paid attention.</v>

5030
02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:25.980
<v Speaker 1>People who didn't care about boxing knew who the heavy weight champion goes are</v>

5031
02:05:25.981 --> 02:05:26.814
<v Speaker 1>boring as fuck.</v>

5032
02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Boring because they're smart and they're not,</v>

5033
02:05:29.850 --> 02:05:30.930
<v Speaker 1>they're not going in there to,</v>

5034
02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:32.220
<v Speaker 1>they're not trying to have blood wars.</v>

5035
02:05:32.221 --> 02:05:32.341
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

5036
02:05:32.341 --> 02:05:32.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5037
02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:33.510
<v Speaker 1>when you watch seven,</v>

5038
02:05:33.511 --> 02:05:35.730
<v Speaker 1>1970s boxing and it's like,</v>

5039
02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:36.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5040
02:05:36.121 --> 02:05:38.840
<v Speaker 1>15 rounds Ernie Shavers.</v>

5041
02:05:38.850 --> 02:05:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5042
02:05:39.390 --> 02:05:41.940
<v Speaker 1>And it's a dude be like breaks his jaw and the third round and it says,</v>

5043
02:05:41.941 --> 02:05:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

5044
02:05:42.630 --> 02:05:42.781
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5045
02:05:42.781 --> 02:05:43.471
<v Speaker 1>I didn't break my jaw.</v>

5046
02:05:43.471 --> 02:05:44.280
<v Speaker 1>I didn't break my job.</v>

5047
02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:44.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5048
02:05:44.581 --> 02:05:45.414
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like,</v>

5049
02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:45.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5050
02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:46.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge Ali fan.</v>

5051
02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:48.540
<v Speaker 1>He's another surrogate Dolly,</v>

5052
02:05:48.541 --> 02:05:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Ken Norton because John and they just still,</v>

5053
02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

5054
02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:52.080
<v Speaker 1>don't say,</v>

5055
02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:53.120
<v Speaker 1>don't tell him buddy.</v>

5056
02:05:53.710 --> 02:05:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll see you at the hospital later that I missed that spectacle of like,</v>

5057
02:05:58.651 --> 02:05:58.891
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5058
02:05:58.891 --> 02:06:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I remember being in a video store in Chicago and they had the Tyson fight on and</v>

5059
02:06:03.211 --> 02:06:04.044
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

5060
02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:05.850
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was a Carl the truth.</v>

5061
02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5062
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:08.790
<v Speaker 1>And it was like the thing where me and my friend go,</v>

5063
02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:09.181
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5064
02:06:09.181 --> 02:06:09.961
<v Speaker 1>let's just stay a minute.</v>

5065
02:06:09.961 --> 02:06:10.800
<v Speaker 1>This will only take a minute.</v>

5066
02:06:10.801 --> 02:06:11.634
<v Speaker 1>And it did.</v>

5067
02:06:13.710 --> 02:06:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Like I liked that,</v>

5068
02:06:15.331 --> 02:06:15.691
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

5069
02:06:15.691 --> 02:06:18.360
<v Speaker 1>And so you know that I'm a fan of that and I miss it.</v>

5070
02:06:18.361 --> 02:06:21.360
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think all those dudes ended up in MMA yet.</v>

5071
02:06:21.361 --> 02:06:21.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5072
02:06:21.601 --> 02:06:22.021
<v Speaker 1>maybe they will.</v>

5073
02:06:22.021 --> 02:06:24.930
<v Speaker 1>I think most of them ended up in football and a lot of them ended up in</v>

5074
02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:25.650
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>

5075
02:06:25.650 --> 02:06:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Terry Norris Turney Norris was a one of those guys from that day.</v>

5076
02:06:28.861 --> 02:06:29.850
<v Speaker 1>It was a big star.</v>

5077
02:06:29.851 --> 02:06:30.960
<v Speaker 1>He's all fucked up now,</v>

5078
02:06:30.961 --> 02:06:31.690
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5079
02:06:31.690 --> 02:06:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I ran into him in Vegas a few years back and I was listening to him talk to some</v>

5080
02:06:36.331 --> 02:06:40.290
<v Speaker 1>fans and he was slurring his words and could barely put a sentence together.</v>

5081
02:06:40.291 --> 02:06:40.740
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

5082
02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:41.221
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

5083
02:06:41.221 --> 02:06:43.440
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Terry Norris was the champ.</v>

5084
02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:43.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5085
02:06:43.741 --> 02:06:45.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's weird to think about Ali,</v>

5086
02:06:45.511 --> 02:06:46.344
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

5087
02:06:46.530 --> 02:06:50.610
<v Speaker 1>it's the jury's out whether he got his Parkinson's related to the center right</v>

5088
02:06:50.611 --> 02:06:51.270
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

5089
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that jury.</v>

5090
02:06:53.210 --> 02:06:54.630
<v Speaker 1>The jury's it filled with idiots.</v>

5091
02:06:54.670 --> 02:06:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5092
02:06:54.930 --> 02:06:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Tell you from a person as a lifetime investment in combat sports.</v>

5093
02:06:57.781 --> 02:06:59.100
<v Speaker 1>That's 100% trauma related.</v>

5094
02:06:59.101 --> 02:06:59.401
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5095
02:06:59.401 --> 02:06:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5096
02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's is a trauma related disease and a lot of people,</v>

5097
02:07:02.311 --> 02:07:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Freddy Roach has Parkinson's related trauma.</v>

5098
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5099
02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:08.910
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why he forced Manny Pacquiao to take a whole year off</v>

5100
02:07:08.911 --> 02:07:10.260
<v Speaker 1>after mark has knocked him out.</v>

5101
02:07:10.570 --> 02:07:11.010
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

5102
02:07:11.010 --> 02:07:11.401
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

5103
02:07:11.401 --> 02:07:13.770
<v Speaker 1>you're not fighting now we're going to take a year off.</v>

5104
02:07:13.900 --> 02:07:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5105
02:07:14.490 --> 02:07:15.323
<v Speaker 1>just to get yourself.</v>

5106
02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a great,</v>

5107
02:07:16.531 --> 02:07:18.930
<v Speaker 1>well then the Ali who's still alive,</v>

5108
02:07:18.931 --> 02:07:20.670
<v Speaker 1>we sort of almost treat him like he's dead.</v>

5109
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:21.781
<v Speaker 1>And then every now and again,</v>

5110
02:07:21.781 --> 02:07:23.180
<v Speaker 1>like he just joined Twitter and you're like,</v>

5111
02:07:23.490 --> 02:07:24.330
<v Speaker 1>it's just weird to be like,</v>

5112
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:26.010
<v Speaker 1>and some of them were coming from the champion you like,</v>

5113
02:07:26.011 --> 02:07:30.930
<v Speaker 1>are they really like if Ali was still with you because he's not that old.</v>

5114
02:07:30.931 --> 02:07:32.280
<v Speaker 1>He's in his 70 [inaudible] he's old,</v>

5115
02:07:32.281 --> 02:07:32.911
<v Speaker 1>but he's not like,</v>

5116
02:07:32.911 --> 02:07:33.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5117
02:07:33.091 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 1>he's got a hundred if he was still around and still talking as in</v>

5118
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:37.660
<v Speaker 2>talking relatively fast and was,</v>

5119
02:07:37.661 --> 02:07:38.080
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

5120
02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:40.360
<v Speaker 2>he'd be an ambassador for you should be a boxer.</v>

5121
02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:41.471
<v Speaker 2>But because of,</v>

5122
02:07:41.471 --> 02:07:41.981
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

5123
02:07:41.981 --> 02:07:43.150
<v Speaker 2>the trauma related injuries,</v>

5124
02:07:43.151 --> 02:07:43.984
<v Speaker 2>he has not,</v>

5125
02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:44.920
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

5126
02:07:44.921 --> 02:07:45.970
<v Speaker 2>no old boxers.</v>

5127
02:07:45.971 --> 02:07:48.370
<v Speaker 2>A good ambassador for boxing except Bernard Hopkins,</v>

5128
02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:49.510
<v Speaker 2>which is ridiculous.</v>

5129
02:07:49.511 --> 02:07:51.010
<v Speaker 2>49 years old still.</v>

5130
02:07:51.011 --> 02:07:52.600
<v Speaker 2>The champ talks great.</v>

5131
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Still full of energy outboxes and shit out us and young guys.</v>

5132
02:07:56.740 --> 02:07:57.860
<v Speaker 2>He's a freak man.</v>

5133
02:07:58.030 --> 02:07:59.250
<v Speaker 2>I think we just talked about earlier with the,</v>

5134
02:07:59.260 --> 02:08:00.880
<v Speaker 2>some people are doing crystal meth and it's fine.</v>

5135
02:08:02.830 --> 02:08:05.160
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing that everybody has to take the hits.</v>

5136
02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Well he's also got a very intelligent style.</v>

5137
02:08:07.841 --> 02:08:09.460
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't brawl with anybody.</v>

5138
02:08:09.461 --> 02:08:12.490
<v Speaker 2>He brawls on his terms clinches a lot.</v>

5139
02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:13.660
<v Speaker 2>He holds onto guys.</v>

5140
02:08:13.810 --> 02:08:14.180
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

5141
02:08:14.180 --> 02:08:14.411
<v Speaker 2>he'll,</v>

5142
02:08:14.411 --> 02:08:19.270
<v Speaker 2>he'll use rough house tactics to push them out of their game and just aware he</v>

5143
02:08:19.271 --> 02:08:20.950
<v Speaker 2>understands what to do.</v>

5144
02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Like before boxing is one of those things where if you look at it and on like if</v>

5145
02:08:25.721 --> 02:08:27.330
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any education in,</v>

5146
02:08:27.331 --> 02:08:29.170
<v Speaker 2>in boxing and you watch it on television like,</v>

5147
02:08:29.171 --> 02:08:32.020
<v Speaker 2>well this guy is trying to hit this guy and the other guy is faster so he can't</v>

5148
02:08:32.021 --> 02:08:32.680
<v Speaker 2>hit him.</v>

5149
02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:32.921
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5150
02:08:32.921 --> 02:08:34.270
<v Speaker 2>This footwork involved.</v>

5151
02:08:34.271 --> 02:08:34.540
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

5152
02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:39.340
<v Speaker 2>he's doing movements that get you to react and he's anticipating your reaction</v>

5153
02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:41.380
<v Speaker 2>and then giving you another thing to think about.</v>

5154
02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:42.760
<v Speaker 2>And then when you react to that,</v>

5155
02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:45.340
<v Speaker 2>you're going to step here and he's ready with an overhand right.</v>

5156
02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:47.620
<v Speaker 2>And these things are all in his mind.</v>

5157
02:08:47.621 --> 02:08:49.210
<v Speaker 2>These are all foregone conclusions.</v>

5158
02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:50.350
<v Speaker 2>But to a young guy,</v>

5159
02:08:50.351 --> 02:08:51.850
<v Speaker 2>he's just going to use his speed and his death,</v>

5160
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:53.950
<v Speaker 2>but you don't ever get a chance to use that speed.</v>

5161
02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:55.150
<v Speaker 2>He's already on you.</v>

5162
02:08:55.151 --> 02:08:58.210
<v Speaker 2>He's already making you move and dance to his rhythm.</v>

5163
02:08:58.211 --> 02:08:59.044
<v Speaker 2>He's got your,</v>

5164
02:08:59.070 --> 02:08:59.950
<v Speaker 2>he's the Marionette,</v>

5165
02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:02.620
<v Speaker 2>you're the puppet and you don't realize it until it's the 10th round.</v>

5166
02:09:02.621 --> 02:09:04.180
<v Speaker 2>You get your ass kicked and you're like,</v>

5167
02:09:04.181 --> 02:09:04.481
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

5168
02:09:04.481 --> 02:09:04.751
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

5169
02:09:04.751 --> 02:09:05.360
<v Speaker 2>you need to knock guy.</v>

5170
02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:06.193
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't even fucking,</v>

5171
02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:08.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5172
02:09:08.230 --> 02:09:08.591
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

5173
02:09:08.591 --> 02:09:10.210
<v Speaker 2>I haven't touched him since the first round.</v>

5174
02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:12.670
<v Speaker 2>You see that Russian guy that he beat for the light heavyweight title,</v>

5175
02:09:14.250 --> 02:09:15.850
<v Speaker 2>he's boxing the shit out of the sky.</v>

5176
02:09:16.450 --> 02:09:18.670
<v Speaker 2>And the 10th round Blam dropped some.</v>

5177
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:19.181
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

5178
02:09:19.181 --> 02:09:19.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5179
02:09:19.361 --> 02:09:22.480
<v Speaker 2>you need to stop him unions in the 10th round Hopkins drops him.</v>

5180
02:09:22.780 --> 02:09:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Mother fucker can't even hit him.</v>

5181
02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:25.480
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5182
02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:26.500
<v Speaker 2>it's just too good.</v>

5183
02:09:27.330 --> 02:09:27.431
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5184
02:09:27.431 --> 02:09:32.380
<v Speaker 2>in college I briefly joined a boxing club and got hit by a dude who was not a</v>

5185
02:09:32.381 --> 02:09:33.250
<v Speaker 2>professional boxer,</v>

5186
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:35.740
<v Speaker 2>but like the hardest I've ever had been hit in my life and I was like,</v>

5187
02:09:35.741 --> 02:09:35.791
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5188
02:09:35.791 --> 02:09:37.120
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm done with this boxing club.</v>

5189
02:09:37.121 --> 02:09:37.280
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

5190
02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:37.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5191
02:09:37.810 --> 02:09:38.551
<v Speaker 2>you get rocked hard.</v>

5192
02:09:38.551 --> 02:09:38.800
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5193
02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:40.570
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to just go back to class.</v>

5194
02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:42.640
<v Speaker 2>They will trying to be a comedian,</v>

5195
02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:46.450
<v Speaker 2>but boxing to be taught properly should be taught where you don't hit each other</v>

5196
02:09:46.451 --> 02:09:47.470
<v Speaker 2>hard at all.</v>

5197
02:09:47.530 --> 02:09:48.011
<v Speaker 2>Well this was,</v>

5198

5212
02:10:04.090 --> 02:10:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I would recommend he,</v>

02:10:11.411 --> 02:10:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Like he played the video for us,</v>

5222
02:10:13.181 --> 02:10:13.661
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

5223
02:10:13.661 --> 02:10:14.320
<v Speaker 2>he just sort of put,</v>

5224
02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:15.460
<v Speaker 2>it was a block boxing club.</v>

5225
02:10:15.461 --> 02:10:17.230
<v Speaker 2>We just to put us in a room and there was no ring.</v>

5226
02:10:17.231 --> 02:10:17.970
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

5227
02:10:17.970 --> 02:10:18.761
<v Speaker 2>and there was one guy,</v>

5228
02:10:18.761 --> 02:10:20.170
<v Speaker 2>five all the fare the same height.</v>

5229
02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:20.591
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5230
02:10:20.591 --> 02:10:21.101
<v Speaker 2>but that guy,</v>

5231
02:10:21.101 --> 02:10:21.761
<v Speaker 2>he outweighed me.</v>

5232
02:10:21.761 --> 02:10:22.571
<v Speaker 2>I was like six four,</v>

<v Speaker 2>understands like the goal is not to just go in there and beat the shit out of</v>

5251
02:10:51.981 --> 02:10:53.600
<v Speaker 2>each other and the strong person survives.</v>

5252
02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:56.240
<v Speaker 2>The goal is to teach someone how to move their head.</v>

5253
02:10:56.241 --> 02:10:59.150
<v Speaker 2>So they don't get hit when he's got his right hand there.</v>

5254
02:10:59.151 --> 02:11:00.740
<v Speaker 2>That means the punch is coming this way.</v>

5255
02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:04.070
<v Speaker 2>I want you to duck under it and then you counter and do everything nice and slow</v>

5256
02:11:04.071 --> 02:11:04.880
<v Speaker 2>at first.</v>

5257
02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:08.810
<v Speaker 2>Develop the movements and then when you spar spar in a very controlled way and</v>

5258
02:11:08.811 --> 02:11:11.900
<v Speaker 2>you'll actually get better at it and then you know you could actually become a</v>

5259
02:11:11.901 --> 02:11:12.734
<v Speaker 2>real boxer.</v>

5260
02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:15.950
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is a lot of these gyms,</v>

5261
02:11:15.951 --> 02:11:16.400
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

5262
02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:17.570
<v Speaker 2>they don't want pussies.</v>

5263
02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:20.000
<v Speaker 2>I just take you and throw you in there.</v>

5264
02:11:20.001 --> 02:11:20.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5265
02:11:20.151 --> 02:11:20.984
<v Speaker 2>it put lace them up.</v>

5266
02:11:21.050 --> 02:11:21.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5267
02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5268
02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:24.650
<v Speaker 2>Although now there's cardio boxing where they are,</v>

5269
02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:26.870
<v Speaker 2>which is not exactly what you're talking about,</v>

5270
02:11:26.871 --> 02:11:30.560
<v Speaker 2>where it's like we're just pretending to buck hitting bags mostly and they're</v>

5271
02:11:30.561 --> 02:11:31.940
<v Speaker 2>doing it with poor form.</v>

5272
02:11:32.210 --> 02:11:35.210
<v Speaker 2>I went to a cardio boxing class and I was watching these people hit the bag of</v>

5273
02:11:35.211 --> 02:11:35.571
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's,</v>

5274
02:11:35.571 --> 02:11:37.070
<v Speaker 2>even telling them to do it right,</v>

5275
02:11:37.490 --> 02:11:38.390
<v Speaker 2>like everything they're doing,</v>

5276
02:11:38.391 --> 02:11:39.920
<v Speaker 2>they're all fucking whale in their arms,</v>

5277
02:11:39.921 --> 02:11:42.290
<v Speaker 2>all goofy and they're not throwing their hips,</v>

5278
02:11:42.710 --> 02:11:45.410
<v Speaker 2>lifting their feet up when they punch and no one's correcting him.</v>

5279
02:11:45.590 --> 02:11:45.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5280
02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:46.910
<v Speaker 2>this is not boxing.</v>

5281
02:11:46.911 --> 02:11:48.020
<v Speaker 2>This is just hitting shit.</v>

5282
02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:50.060
<v Speaker 2>It ain't shit is exercise.</v>

5283
02:11:50.070 --> 02:11:50.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5284
02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:52.430
<v Speaker 2>can't even call it cardio boxing.</v>

5285
02:11:53.590 --> 02:11:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5286
02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:54.471
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

5287
02:11:54.471 --> 02:11:56.610
<v Speaker 2>it is interesting what you said about the,</v>

5288
02:11:56.640 --> 02:11:57.710
<v Speaker 2>the heavyweight division,</v>

5289
02:11:57.950 --> 02:12:00.680
<v Speaker 2>the heavyweight division being this division that's sort of,</v>

5290
02:12:00.681 --> 02:12:04.160
<v Speaker 2>but you still have guys like Adrian Broner that are coming up.</v>

5291
02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:05.170
<v Speaker 2>You'd still have guide.</v>

5292
02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:07.820
<v Speaker 2>I have not paid attention a long time because it sort of became a thing where it</v>

5293
02:12:07.821 --> 02:12:08.240
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

5294
02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:09.350
<v Speaker 2>it was just felt like a desert,</v>

5295
02:12:09.351 --> 02:12:10.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a heavyweight division.</v>

5296
02:12:10.631 --> 02:12:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5297
02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:10.971
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5298
02:12:10.971 --> 02:12:11.210
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5299
02:12:11.210 --> 02:12:11.931
<v Speaker 2>I will,</v>

5300
02:12:11.931 --> 02:12:13.050
<v Speaker 2>I will watch many packages.</v>

5301
02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Russians have a stranglehold on that mother fucker.</v>

5302
02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:16.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5303
02:12:16.941 --> 02:12:17.630
<v Speaker 2>They're not letting it go.</v>

5304
02:12:17.630 --> 02:12:18.470
<v Speaker 2>It'll be interesting to see,</v>

5305
02:12:18.471 --> 02:12:19.370
<v Speaker 2>cause he's still the champ,</v>

5306
02:12:19.371 --> 02:12:19.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5307
02:12:19.610 --> 02:12:20.750
<v Speaker 2>Klitschko Oh yeah.</v>

5308
02:12:21.050 --> 02:12:21.490
<v Speaker 2>When he,</v>

5309
02:12:21.490 --> 02:12:22.460
<v Speaker 2>cause he's pretty old too.</v>

5310
02:12:22.461 --> 02:12:23.360
<v Speaker 2>He's not a young dude.</v>

5311
02:12:23.361 --> 02:12:24.194
<v Speaker 2>He was like 40.</v>

5312
02:12:24.210 --> 02:12:24.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5313
02:12:24.491 --> 02:12:25.520
<v Speaker 2>But when he retires,</v>

5314
02:12:25.521 --> 02:12:26.480
<v Speaker 2>like what happens?</v>

5315
02:12:26.481 --> 02:12:27.314
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

5316
02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:27.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5317
02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:31.010
<v Speaker 2>I think that boxing could use a central organization that sort of like,</v>

5318
02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:32.100
<v Speaker 2>it's never going to happen.</v>

5319
02:12:32.100 --> 02:12:32.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5320
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.641
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5321
02:12:32.641 --> 02:12:33.250
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's,</v>

5322
02:12:33.250 --> 02:12:33.711
<v Speaker 2>you know why?</v>

5323
02:12:33.711 --> 02:12:35.590
<v Speaker 2>Because you can start your own organization.</v>

5324
02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:36.080
<v Speaker 2>The ghetto.</v>

5325
02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:37.160
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm going to start to.</v>

5326
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:41.600
<v Speaker 2>MMA has done it in a way where like if you organized a,</v>

5327
02:12:41.601 --> 02:12:42.081
<v Speaker 2>an event,</v>

5328
02:12:42.081 --> 02:12:43.700
<v Speaker 2>like you call it the WTF,</v>

5329
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:44.151
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5330
02:12:44.151 --> 02:12:44.990
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

5331
02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:48.350
<v Speaker 2>and you decided to have an event and you say,</v>

5332
02:12:48.351 --> 02:12:50.870
<v Speaker 2>this is my w fo world champion.</v>

5333
02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:52.550
<v Speaker 2>That's a world champion.</v>

5334
02:12:52.551 --> 02:12:54.980
<v Speaker 2>That's what the WBA does for boxing.</v>

5335
02:12:54.981 --> 02:12:55.701
<v Speaker 2>The IBF,</v>

5336
02:12:55.701 --> 02:12:56.271
<v Speaker 2>the Ibo,</v>

5337
02:12:56.271 --> 02:12:57.530
<v Speaker 2>there's all these different organizations.</v>

5338
02:12:57.531 --> 02:12:58.364
<v Speaker 2>WBC,</v>

5339
02:12:58.940 --> 02:12:59.840
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>

5340
02:12:59.841 --> 02:13:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Is that the thing?</v>

5341
02:13:01.070 --> 02:13:06.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like the NFL super bowl champion is a fucking NFL champion.</v>

5342
02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:06.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5343
02:13:06.231 --> 02:13:07.130
<v Speaker 2>There's no question that the,</v>

5344
02:13:07.190 --> 02:13:09.830
<v Speaker 2>whoever wins the super bowl is the best football team in the world at that</v>

5345
02:13:09.831 --> 02:13:10.131
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

5346
02:13:10.131 --> 02:13:11.050
<v Speaker 2>There's not somebody in,</v>

5347
02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:12.140
<v Speaker 2>there's not a football team in Europe.</v>

5348
02:13:12.170 --> 02:13:12.381
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

5349
02:13:12.381 --> 02:13:12.621
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5350
02:13:12.621 --> 02:13:13.460
<v Speaker 2>we could actually,</v>

5351
02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:14.211
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

5352
02:13:14.211 --> 02:13:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5353
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:17.780
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is with boxing is there's just so many organizations and once</v>

5354
02:13:17.781 --> 02:13:19.580
<v Speaker 2>that happens you can't take it back.</v>

5355
02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:20.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5356
02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:21.770
<v Speaker 2>you can't get all those people together and say,</v>

5357
02:13:21.771 --> 02:13:21.921
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

5358
02:13:21.921 --> 02:13:25.760
<v Speaker 2>let's all form one organization and we'll split the money but the fuck out of</v>

5359
02:13:25.761 --> 02:13:25.970
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

5360
02:13:25.970 --> 02:13:26.541
<v Speaker 2>And that's the,</v>

5361
02:13:26.541 --> 02:13:26.871
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

5362
02:13:26.871 --> 02:13:29.180
<v Speaker 2>it's the everybody wants the money is what dictates the thing.</v>

5363
02:13:29.181 --> 02:13:29.920
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

5364
02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:30.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5365
02:13:30.170 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 2>I remember when unifying the title was three</v>

5366
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:32.521
<v Speaker 1>titles.</v>

5367
02:13:32.521 --> 02:13:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

5368
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:34.170
<v Speaker 1>It was the WBA,</v>

5369
02:13:34.171 --> 02:13:35.490
<v Speaker 1>the WBC and IBF.</v>

5370
02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:39.870
<v Speaker 1>IBF was late in the game around like the eighties I believe.</v>

5371
02:13:39.871 --> 02:13:40.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5372
02:13:40.021 --> 02:13:41.760
<v Speaker 1>I remember when people resist both.</v>

5373
02:13:41.761 --> 02:13:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I think he threw it in the trash.</v>

5374
02:13:42.871 --> 02:13:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Get through one of the titles of the Trashcan and yeah,</v>

5375
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:47.620
<v Speaker 1>big deal.</v>

5376
02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5377
02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:49.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5378
02:13:49.590 --> 02:13:50.401
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

5379
02:13:50.401 --> 02:13:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Sanctioning fees.</v>

5380
02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.590
<v Speaker 1>The sanction fees to fight for a WPA test fucking through the roof.</v>

5381
02:13:55.591 --> 02:13:56.700
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy money.</v>

5382
02:13:56.980 --> 02:13:57.813
<v Speaker 1>Like for what are you,</v>

5383
02:13:57.900 --> 02:13:58.733
<v Speaker 1>what are you fucking,</v>

5384
02:13:59.010 --> 02:14:03.780
<v Speaker 1>what am I getting that given you $1 million and what the fuck are you getting?</v>

5385
02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:04.711
<v Speaker 1>This is again,</v>

5386
02:14:04.711 --> 02:14:05.131
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

5387
02:14:05.131 --> 02:14:05.964
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

5388
02:14:06.070 --> 02:14:06.600
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

5389
02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe some wouldn't call it corruption,</v>

5390
02:14:08.911 --> 02:14:10.520
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's the corruption is everywhere.</v>

5391
02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Trying to get as much of the money as they can,</v>

5392
02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:13.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's not good for the sport.</v>

5393
02:14:13.590 --> 02:14:14.311
<v Speaker 1>You know what it should be,</v>

5394
02:14:14.311 --> 02:14:14.581
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5395
02:14:14.581 --> 02:14:16.290
<v Speaker 1>it should be like ring magazine.</v>

5396
02:14:16.650 --> 02:14:17.011
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5397
02:14:17.011 --> 02:14:17.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5398
02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:18.660
<v Speaker 1>ring magazine has a rank champion.</v>

5399
02:14:18.661 --> 02:14:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they have to pay to be the ring champion.</v>

5400
02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:22.110
<v Speaker 1>I should abandon everything.</v>

5401
02:14:22.111 --> 02:14:23.100
<v Speaker 1>But the ring title,</v>

5402
02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:25.260
<v Speaker 1>ring magazine is not going to do your dirty.</v>

5403
02:14:25.261 --> 02:14:25.500
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

5404
02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:26.333
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

5405
02:14:26.550 --> 02:14:27.810
<v Speaker 1>They want the sport to be good,</v>

5406
02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:29.010
<v Speaker 1>they want the best.</v>

5407
02:14:29.011 --> 02:14:30.590
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's the problem with the edit.</v>

5408
02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:31.650
<v Speaker 1>There's my in it.</v>

5409
02:14:31.650 --> 02:14:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5410
02:14:32.130 --> 02:14:35.120
<v Speaker 1>There's money in deciding who's the WBC,</v>

5411
02:14:35.130 --> 02:14:36.000
<v Speaker 1>the WBA.</v>

5412
02:14:36.001 --> 02:14:37.560
<v Speaker 1>It's that unchecked capitalism thing.</v>

5413
02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Communism as a point.</v>

5414
02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:40.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5415
02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy this phone that was made by Chinese children,</v>

5416
02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:47.820
<v Speaker 1>but I also think that we should probably pay them a living wage.</v>

5417
02:14:47.821 --> 02:14:48.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5418
02:14:48.570 --> 02:14:49.590
<v Speaker 1>you gotta make good phones,</v>

5419
02:14:49.591 --> 02:14:50.640
<v Speaker 1>but let's pay them a living wage.</v>

5420
02:14:50.670 --> 02:14:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you have nets around the building where you work to keep people from</v>

5421
02:14:53.911 --> 02:14:54.721
<v Speaker 1>jumping off the roof,</v>

5422
02:14:54.721 --> 02:14:57.420
<v Speaker 1>cause there's so many fucking people jumping off that you'd need nets.</v>

5423
02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5424
02:14:58.020 --> 02:14:58.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5425
02:14:58.261 --> 02:14:58.661
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

5426
02:14:58.661 --> 02:15:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should think we should look into this.</v>

5427
02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5428
02:15:00.590 --> 02:15:00.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5429
02:15:00.811 --> 02:15:01.644
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should.</v>

5430
02:15:02.190 --> 02:15:02.611
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

5431
02:15:02.611 --> 02:15:03.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5432
02:15:03.420 --> 02:15:04.950
<v Speaker 1>do you think there's a way around that?</v>

5433
02:15:04.951 --> 02:15:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Because that's,</v>

5434
02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:08.940
<v Speaker 1>that's drives me nuts about not just cell phones,</v>

5435
02:15:08.941 --> 02:15:13.260
<v Speaker 1>but about like people that drive Prius's and Shit and say that I'm helping the</v>

5436
02:15:13.261 --> 02:15:13.741
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

5437
02:15:13.741 --> 02:15:14.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm being socially conscious.</v>

5438
02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:17.790
<v Speaker 1>And you're also driving a fucking box filled with conflict minerals.</v>

5439
02:15:18.290 --> 02:15:19.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5440
02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:23.430
<v Speaker 1>every fucking lithium ion crystal and that came out of a fucking mine in the</v>

5441
02:15:23.431 --> 02:15:26.250
<v Speaker 1>ground in Africa and it's likely a child that might have been pulling it out.</v>

5442
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5443
02:15:26.700 --> 02:15:29.100
<v Speaker 1>somebody said to me that day because of my act in the way I talk about things</v>

5444
02:15:29.101 --> 02:15:30.150
<v Speaker 1>like how would you identify yourself?</v>

5445
02:15:30.170 --> 02:15:31.940
<v Speaker 1>You were socialist and your comment is like not do that.</v>

5446
02:15:31.941 --> 02:15:34.290
<v Speaker 1>He's went to the apple store and got me an iPod touch.</v>

5447
02:15:35.670 --> 02:15:36.503
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very,</v>

5448
02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:37.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very proud,</v>

5449
02:15:37.650 --> 02:15:38.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe a reluctant capitalist,</v>

5450
02:15:38.941 --> 02:15:40.290
<v Speaker 1>but I also like a nice house too.</v>

5451
02:15:40.290 --> 02:15:40.950
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

5452
02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I just think that there's ethics,</v>

5453
02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:43.980
<v Speaker 1>there's ethics rules.</v>

5454
02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm like when I go to pay,</v>

5455
02:15:46.230 --> 02:15:49.680
<v Speaker 1>when I went to go try to buy a new phone and they said it's going to be $700 if</v>

5456
02:15:49.681 --> 02:15:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5457
02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:55.100
<v Speaker 1>if I thought that that's $700 was actually going to a living wage for somebody,</v>

5458
02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:55.801
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

5459
02:15:55.801 --> 02:15:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I buy it,</v>

5460
02:15:56.671 --> 02:15:57.391
<v Speaker 1>but I would think about it,</v>

5461
02:15:57.391 --> 02:15:59.370
<v Speaker 1>but I know it's like you're just making up a price.</v>

5462
02:15:59.410 --> 02:15:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5463
02:15:59.970 --> 02:16:01.340
<v Speaker 1>This is not actually a pot,</v>

5464
02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:03.570
<v Speaker 1>like we're probably paying too little for our phones.</v>

5465
02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:05.910
<v Speaker 1>They should probably all be twice as much as they are,</v>

5466
02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:10.320
<v Speaker 1>but we all had this thing where I want the 50 isn't it $50 with the free rebate</v>

5467
02:16:10.321 --> 02:16:10.860
<v Speaker 1>or something?</v>

5468
02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5469
02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:11.993
<v Speaker 1>We want that,</v>

5470
02:16:12.090 --> 02:16:13.830
<v Speaker 1>but that's a problem because that doesn't,</v>

5471
02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:15.030
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't help the world.</v>

5472
02:16:15.031 --> 02:16:16.620
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing with like with like,</v>

5473
02:16:16.621 --> 02:16:17.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5474
02:16:17.010 --> 02:16:17.880
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage,</v>

5475
02:16:17.881 --> 02:16:18.830
<v Speaker 1>raising the minimum wage.</v>

5476
02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:21.030
<v Speaker 1>If you raise the minimum wage,</v>

5477
02:16:21.031 --> 02:16:22.410
<v Speaker 1>you have less job turnover.</v>

5478
02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:23.940
<v Speaker 1>If people have more pride in their job,</v>

5479
02:16:23.941 --> 02:16:26.730
<v Speaker 1>because we have customer services sucks in this country because the dude got</v>

5480
02:16:26.731 --> 02:16:30.490
<v Speaker 1>hired two days ago and he's looking and he's looking a new job isn't there also</v>

5481
02:16:30.491 --> 02:16:33.530
<v Speaker 1>like when you look at the amount of profit that apple has made and probably the</v>

5482
02:16:33.550 --> 02:16:36.850
<v Speaker 1>apple has something like $60 billion in the fucking bank,</v>

5483
02:16:36.851 --> 02:16:41.620
<v Speaker 1>like how much would you have in the bank if you paid people more money to make</v>

5484
02:16:41.621 --> 02:16:44.410
<v Speaker 1>those phones and you made them in America and you made less profit,</v>

5485
02:16:44.411 --> 02:16:47.590
<v Speaker 1>but the people all made a living wage like can we worked out on paper?</v>

5486
02:16:47.610 --> 02:16:49.120
<v Speaker 1>That's so I can see what that would be.</v>

5487
02:16:49.140 --> 02:16:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5488
02:16:49.250 --> 02:16:49.691
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

5489
02:16:49.691 --> 02:16:50.680
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing with Walmart.</v>

5490
02:16:50.681 --> 02:16:51.421
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

5491
02:16:51.421 --> 02:16:52.030
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5492
02:16:52.030 --> 02:16:54.310
<v Speaker 1>if they paid everybody like $12 an hour,</v>

5493
02:16:54.311 --> 02:16:54.730
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>

5494
02:16:54.730 --> 02:16:56.390
<v Speaker 1>they would make like $3 billion.</v>

5495
02:16:56.420 --> 02:16:57.011
<v Speaker 1>Like it's still,</v>

5496
02:16:57.011 --> 02:16:57.181
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5497
02:16:57.181 --> 02:17:00.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not like how much profit do you need to make and at some point,</v>

5498
02:17:00.730 --> 02:17:02.290
<v Speaker 1>and I get that you're allowed to set the price,</v>

5499
02:17:02.310 --> 02:17:02.801
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want.</v>

5500
02:17:02.801 --> 02:17:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm some market,</v>

5501
02:17:03.670 --> 02:17:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to my dad right now.</v>

5502
02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5503
02:17:05.470 --> 02:17:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Like my dad has a bargain,</v>

5504
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:08.380
<v Speaker 1>but we all have to agree.</v>

5505
02:17:08.381 --> 02:17:12.160
<v Speaker 1>We live in a society that we're not individuals living in our little islands,</v>

5506
02:17:12.161 --> 02:17:14.290
<v Speaker 1>but I think corporations treat it like I am.</v>

5507
02:17:14.470 --> 02:17:16.150
<v Speaker 1>We are all our own little country.</v>

5508
02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:16.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5509
02:17:16.631 --> 02:17:20.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why there's something like a minimum wage and that we all kind</v>

5510
02:17:20.261 --> 02:17:24.490
<v Speaker 1>of agree there should be some minimum wage is because corporations have no</v>

5511
02:17:24.491 --> 02:17:25.540
<v Speaker 1>fucking soul.</v>

5512
02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:26.121
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5513
02:17:26.121 --> 02:17:27.340
<v Speaker 1>It just about money.</v>

5514
02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:29.510
<v Speaker 1>They're about bottom line in there.</v>

5515
02:17:29.530 --> 02:17:30.131
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

5516
02:17:30.131 --> 02:17:34.660
<v Speaker 1>their duty to their shareholders is to increase their bottom line and they have</v>

5517
02:17:34.661 --> 02:17:35.650
<v Speaker 1>to make more every year.</v>

5518
02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5519
02:17:36.180 --> 02:17:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5520
02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:36.671
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>

5521
02:17:36.671 --> 02:17:36.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5522
02:17:36.821 --> 02:17:37.720
<v Speaker 1>They can't have flat,</v>

5523
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:38.860
<v Speaker 1>they can't have flat growth.</v>

5524
02:17:38.890 --> 02:17:40.030
<v Speaker 1>They have to Harris,</v>

5525
02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:41.800
<v Speaker 1>we made $1 billion last year.</v>

5526
02:17:41.801 --> 02:17:43.210
<v Speaker 1>We only made $1 billion this year.</v>

5527
02:17:43.211 --> 02:17:44.170
<v Speaker 1>What's happening down there?</v>

5528
02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:46.630
<v Speaker 1>What's happened to those kids in that factory?</v>

5529
02:17:46.650 --> 02:17:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5530
02:17:47.230 --> 02:17:48.063
<v Speaker 1>they need to make less.</v>

5531
02:17:48.430 --> 02:17:49.180
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

5532
02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:50.530
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I think is like,</v>

5533
02:17:50.710 --> 02:17:53.110
<v Speaker 1>and the thing with the minimum wage is that it hasn't kept up with inflation.</v>

5534
02:17:53.111 --> 02:17:56.050
<v Speaker 1>If minimum wage is tracked with the ICAN with inflation and the,</v>

5535
02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:56.951
<v Speaker 1>it would be fine,</v>

5536
02:17:56.951 --> 02:17:58.000
<v Speaker 1>but it has not kept up.</v>

5537
02:17:58.001 --> 02:17:58.834
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

5538
02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:01.630
<v Speaker 1>and you know my dad who I've talked to my dad,</v>

5539
02:18:01.631 --> 02:18:01.991
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>

5540
02:18:01.991 --> 02:18:02.710
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

5541
02:18:02.710 --> 02:18:04.180
<v Speaker 1>those jobs are pass through jobs.</v>

5542
02:18:04.181 --> 02:18:05.880
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to have work at Walmart forever.</v>

5543
02:18:06.010 --> 02:18:06.191
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

5544
02:18:06.191 --> 02:18:07.480
<v Speaker 1>the factory left town.</v>

5545
02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5546
02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:10.870
<v Speaker 1>There's no good union jobs and there's not a lot of good union jobs where you</v>

5547
02:18:10.871 --> 02:18:14.050
<v Speaker 1>can work at the GM factory for 25 years and retire with a gold watch.</v>

5548
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5549
02:18:14.710 --> 02:18:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Walmart is the factor.</v>

5550
02:18:15.761 --> 02:18:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's some jobs that are really good for kids.</v>

5551
02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:22.000
<v Speaker 1>There's some jobs and kids just get out of high school and they have an entry</v>

5552
02:18:22.001 --> 02:18:22.860
<v Speaker 1>level job there.</v>

5553
02:18:22.861 --> 02:18:25.840
<v Speaker 1>There are some jobs that probably shouldn't pay a shitload of money,</v>

5554
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:26.530
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

5555
02:18:26.530 --> 02:18:27.160
<v Speaker 1>not a shitload,</v>

5556
02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:27.551
<v Speaker 1>but they should.</v>

5557
02:18:27.551 --> 02:18:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5558
02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:29.170
<v Speaker 1>If you're working all week,</v>

5559
02:18:29.230 --> 02:18:30.430
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to live on that.</v>

5560
02:18:30.490 --> 02:18:30.881
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5561
02:18:30.881 --> 02:18:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5562
02:18:31.450 --> 02:18:33.580
<v Speaker 1>If you fulltime work,</v>

5563
02:18:33.581 --> 02:18:34.930
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to afford to,</v>

5564
02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.750
<v Speaker 1>he should be able to eat and you should be able to sleep somewhere and the,</v>

5565
02:18:37.751 --> 02:18:41.170
<v Speaker 1>and the government should want you to be able to be able to actually not just</v>

5566
02:18:41.171 --> 02:18:41.831
<v Speaker 1>live for yourself,</v>

5567
02:18:41.831 --> 02:18:44.740
<v Speaker 1>but also be married and have an afford to be married and afford to have a kid</v>

5568
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:47.560
<v Speaker 1>having two kids because that all feeds the economy.</v>

5569
02:18:47.950 --> 02:18:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Like you shouldn't want somebody to be struggling and not afford to.</v>

5570
02:18:51.310 --> 02:18:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I guess we can to have a kid and I guess or whatever.</v>

5571
02:18:53.951 --> 02:18:56.680
<v Speaker 1>We can only have one cause I guess you need a better job come out.</v>

5572
02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:00.970
<v Speaker 1>She need to get out of North Dakota somehow and find yourself a good place where</v>

5573
02:19:00.971 --> 02:19:01.870
<v Speaker 1>you can get a good income.</v>

5574
02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:02.441
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5575
02:19:02.441 --> 02:19:03.221
<v Speaker 1>I moved to San Francisco.</v>

5576
02:19:03.221 --> 02:19:04.054
<v Speaker 1>You can't afford to live.</v>

5577
02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5578
02:19:04.710 --> 02:19:06.430
<v Speaker 1>We didn't get a $4 million shack.</v>

5579
02:19:06.460 --> 02:19:06.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5580
02:19:06.821 --> 02:19:07.570
<v Speaker 1>So I did that.</v>

5581
02:19:07.570 --> 02:19:08.470
<v Speaker 1>It's such a,</v>

5582
02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:10.630
<v Speaker 1>it's to me that's so clear that like,</v>

5583
02:19:10.631 --> 02:19:11.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5584
02:19:11.110 --> 02:19:14.330
<v Speaker 1>if we raise the minimum wage it helps the economy certainly sends her.</v>

5585
02:19:14.331 --> 02:19:17.530
<v Speaker 1>But I have a small business and if I raised them in which your employees won't</v>

5586
02:19:17.531 --> 02:19:18.191
<v Speaker 1>be so shitty,</v>

5587
02:19:18.191 --> 02:19:20.770
<v Speaker 1>that's what will happen and they won't quit every two weeks.</v>

5588
02:19:20.860 --> 02:19:22.330
<v Speaker 1>How much money should it be though?</v>

5589
02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:23.830
<v Speaker 1>What should the minimum wage be?</v>

5590
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I think I,</v>

5591
02:19:24.730 --> 02:19:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5592
02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not an economist,</v>

5593
02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:31.670
<v Speaker 1>but I think $15 an hour is not outside the bounds of no reasonable.</v>

5594
02:19:31.670 --> 02:19:32.480
<v Speaker 1>For somebody who's like,</v>

5595
02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:35.300
<v Speaker 1>and I think I don't even have a problem if you track it to the city.</v>

5596
02:19:35.301 --> 02:19:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Like I think some cities you need $17 an hour.</v>

5597
02:19:37.641 --> 02:19:39.610
<v Speaker 1>In some cities maybe you need 12 right.</v>

5598
02:19:39.650 --> 02:19:39.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5599
02:19:39.941 --> 02:19:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just the,</v>

5600
02:19:41.150 --> 02:19:41.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5601
02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:42.150
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

5602
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:43.110
<v Speaker 1>cause like San Francisco,</v>

5603
02:19:43.580 --> 02:19:47.780
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco has a higher minimum wage then the Nash than the national minimum</v>

5604
02:19:47.781 --> 02:19:48.200
<v Speaker 1>wage.</v>

5605
02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Does it?</v>

5606
02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5607
02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:50.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5608
02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:50.421
<v Speaker 1>I forget,</v>

5609
02:19:50.421 --> 02:19:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the national mood,</v>

5610
02:19:51.351 --> 02:19:52.610
<v Speaker 1>but San Francisco is like bucks or something.</v>

5611
02:19:52.611 --> 02:19:55.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like eight 50 I think because they know that it's still,</v>

5612
02:19:55.710 --> 02:19:57.500
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking San Francisco,</v>

5613
02:19:57.530 --> 02:19:57.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5614
02:19:57.841 --> 02:19:58.040
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5615
02:19:58.040 --> 02:19:58.310
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5616
02:19:58.310 --> 02:19:59.680
<v Speaker 1>they are aware and it's still present.</v>

5617
02:19:59.690 --> 02:20:00.381
<v Speaker 1>It's still not enough,</v>

5618
02:20:00.381 --> 02:20:02.300
<v Speaker 1>but at least there's the service about,</v>

5619
02:20:02.301 --> 02:20:03.340
<v Speaker 1>we realized that this is the,</v>

5620
02:20:03.370 --> 02:20:05.090
<v Speaker 1>the city is not North Dakota.</v>

5621
02:20:05.330 --> 02:20:08.630
<v Speaker 1>There's three things that you bring up when people go fucking bananas about</v>

5622
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:10.250
<v Speaker 1>climate change,</v>

5623
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:13.160
<v Speaker 1>racism and minimum wage.</v>

5624
02:20:13.220 --> 02:20:14.900
<v Speaker 1>And we've talked about all three of them.</v>

5625
02:20:15.060 --> 02:20:15.750
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

5626
02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:17.960
<v Speaker 1>When you start talking about minimum wage,</v>

5627
02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:20.750
<v Speaker 1>the fucking quote unquote economic experts,</v>

5628
02:20:21.050 --> 02:20:21.830
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

5629
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:22.970
<v Speaker 1>here's what I've noticed.</v>

5630
02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Most of them aren't rich.</v>

5631
02:20:25.050 --> 02:20:25.860
<v Speaker 1>One of the people,</v>

5632
02:20:25.860 --> 02:20:28.550
<v Speaker 1>the people that fucking chime in on these discussions.</v>

5633
02:20:28.551 --> 02:20:32.360
<v Speaker 1>I've had deep conversations with these people like back and forth for a long</v>

5634
02:20:32.361 --> 02:20:32.661
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

5635
02:20:32.661 --> 02:20:35.540
<v Speaker 1>but I know zero about economics.</v>

5636
02:20:35.860 --> 02:20:37.100
<v Speaker 1>And so when I've said,</v>

5637
02:20:37.101 --> 02:20:37.311
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

5638
02:20:37.311 --> 02:20:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I just think that people should be able to live on the amount of money that they</v>

5639
02:20:40.461 --> 02:20:41.180
<v Speaker 1>make during the week,</v>

5640
02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:44.360
<v Speaker 1>and people come up with all these reasons why that's bullshit and all these</v>

5641
02:20:44.361 --> 02:20:46.250
<v Speaker 1>reasons why that's bad for business and all these years.</v>

5642
02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:47.990
<v Speaker 1>And I eventually,</v>

5643
02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:52.070
<v Speaker 1>in the conversation I get to how much do you make?</v>

5644
02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:53.300
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

5645
02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:54.021
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>

5646
02:20:54.021 --> 02:20:55.490
<v Speaker 1>do you run a business or you know,</v>

5647
02:20:55.491 --> 02:20:56.990
<v Speaker 1>none of them run buck and businesses.</v>

5648
02:20:57.110 --> 02:21:01.190
<v Speaker 1>They all have this idea in their head that America is filled with people.</v>

5649
02:21:01.250 --> 02:21:01.461
<v Speaker 1>And I've,</v>

5650
02:21:01.461 --> 02:21:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I've read this quote somewhere,</v>

5651
02:21:02.661 --> 02:21:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I forget who to,</v>

5652
02:21:03.460 --> 02:21:07.670
<v Speaker 1>who to attribute it to that think that they are about to become a millionaire</v>

5653
02:21:07.940 --> 02:21:11.030
<v Speaker 1>and they want to make sure there's no laws in place.</v>

5654
02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:14.030
<v Speaker 1>They're going to fuck them over once they become a millionaire.</v>

5655
02:21:14.060 --> 02:21:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5656
02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:14.601
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5657
02:21:14.601 --> 02:21:14.811
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5658
02:21:14.811 --> 02:21:15.321
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

5659
02:21:15.321 --> 02:21:16.131
<v Speaker 1>it's people.</v>

5660
02:21:16.131 --> 02:21:19.310
<v Speaker 1>It's the reason why people vote against their own personal interest because I'm</v>

5661
02:21:19.311 --> 02:21:20.510
<v Speaker 1>going to vote with the,</v>

5662
02:21:20.511 --> 02:21:21.470
<v Speaker 1>then I'm not trying to,</v>

5663
02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:24.650
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to vote with the Republican party because they have,</v>

5664
02:21:24.651 --> 02:21:26.000
<v Speaker 1>they don't want taxes.</v>

5665
02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:27.830
<v Speaker 1>And one day I'm going to be rich and I'm not going to what?</v>

5666
02:21:27.831 --> 02:21:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Taxes.</v>

5667
02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:29.031
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's like,</v>

5668
02:21:29.031 --> 02:21:31.550
<v Speaker 1>well right now you're getting you some taxes might help you.</v>

5669
02:21:31.551 --> 02:21:32.061
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

5670
02:21:32.061 --> 02:21:32.894
<v Speaker 1>Like it would help you.</v>

5671
02:21:32.950 --> 02:21:34.400
<v Speaker 1>It would help your community and your neighborhood.</v>

5672
02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:34.701
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

5673
02:21:34.701 --> 02:21:35.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm one day.</v>

5674
02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:39.170
<v Speaker 1>So we're just thinking the world is a people that are republican that are broke,</v>

5675
02:21:39.171 --> 02:21:41.480
<v Speaker 1>that are voting for corporate interests.</v>

5676
02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5677
02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5678
02:21:42.050 --> 02:21:43.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like what are you doing?</v>

5679
02:21:43.341 --> 02:21:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Cause people think that everybody thinks they're one.</v>

5680
02:21:45.381 --> 02:21:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Not Everybody.</v>

5681
02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:48.460
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think they're one lottery ticket away from being in the 1% or</v>

5682
02:21:48.470 --> 02:21:51.410
<v Speaker 1>one step or one or one.</v>

5683
02:21:51.570 --> 02:21:52.900
<v Speaker 1>One jump shot one.</v>

5684
02:21:53.470 --> 02:21:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5685
02:21:53.940 --> 02:21:54.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5686
02:21:54.231 --> 02:21:54.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5687
02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:59.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's weird how the Republican Party is like a party that supports big</v>

5688
02:21:59.271 --> 02:21:59.781
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

5689
02:21:59.781 --> 02:22:01.070
<v Speaker 1>like sort of unequivocably.</v>

5690
02:22:01.250 --> 02:22:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Yet they're more supported by under in colic,</v>

5691
02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:06.620
<v Speaker 1>lower income conservative people.</v>

5692
02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:09.920
<v Speaker 1>It's the reason why people who don't live in New York like the Yankees,</v>

5693
02:22:09.921 --> 02:22:11.030
<v Speaker 1>because they feel like they're the best.</v>

5694
02:22:11.031 --> 02:22:11.181
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

5695
02:22:11.181 --> 02:22:11.870
<v Speaker 1>they're the,</v>

5696
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:12.890
<v Speaker 1>they're the winning team.</v>

5697
02:22:13.490 --> 02:22:14.870
<v Speaker 1>And even though it's not connected to,</v>

5698
02:22:14.871 --> 02:22:16.130
<v Speaker 1>even though it's not connected to them,</v>

5699
02:22:16.131 --> 02:22:17.670
<v Speaker 1>they just feel like I want to be with the winners.</v>

5700
02:22:17.690 --> 02:22:17.961
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

5701
02:22:17.961 --> 02:22:22.820
<v Speaker 1>the team that is most aligned with Jesus is the Yankees wasn't publicans.</v>

5702
02:22:22.990 --> 02:22:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5703
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.751
<v Speaker 1>Republicans,</v>

5704
02:22:23.751 --> 02:22:24.020
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

5705
02:22:24.020 --> 02:22:24.420
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5706
02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5707
02:22:24.810 --> 02:22:25.351
<v Speaker 1>Republicans,</v>

5708
02:22:25.351 --> 02:22:26.184
<v Speaker 1>by tying</v>

5709
02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:31.050
<v Speaker 2>patriotism to God that's swept the whole bunch of people in there.</v>

5710
02:22:31.051 --> 02:22:33.330
<v Speaker 2>I saw a sign in Alabama that said America,</v>

5711
02:22:33.331 --> 02:22:34.200
<v Speaker 2>bless God,</v>

5712
02:22:34.740 --> 02:22:35.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what that means,</v>

5713
02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:38.340
<v Speaker 2>but that was a billboard that I saw that was sort of,</v>

5714
02:22:38.510 --> 02:22:39.030
<v Speaker 2>so we're like,</v>

5715
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.241
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

5716
02:22:39.241 --> 02:22:40.074
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

5717
02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:41.400
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

5718
02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:42.300
<v Speaker 2>we got was America.</v>

5719
02:22:42.330 --> 02:22:43.680
<v Speaker 2>But it was actually like putting,</v>

5720
02:22:43.681 --> 02:22:44.371
<v Speaker 2>it was sort of saying,</v>

5721
02:22:44.371 --> 02:22:44.551
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5722
02:22:44.551 --> 02:22:46.500
<v Speaker 2>we made as the god of Americans to God and,</v>

5723
02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:47.131
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

5724
02:22:47.131 --> 02:22:48.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what that means,</v>

5725
02:22:48.031 --> 02:22:49.950
<v Speaker 2>but clearly I don't think I want to rent a house here.</v>

5726
02:22:50.090 --> 02:22:52.200
<v Speaker 2>America is better than the creator of the universe.</v>

5727
02:22:52.201 --> 02:22:52.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5728
02:22:52.541 --> 02:22:52.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5729
02:22:52.700 --> 02:22:53.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5730
02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:54.570
<v Speaker 2>You believe in the creator of the universe.</v>

5731
02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:56.010
<v Speaker 2>America's better than that.</v>

5732
02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:58.620
<v Speaker 2>So we bless the creator of the universe,</v>

5733
02:22:58.860 --> 02:22:59.790
<v Speaker 2>keeps a little pat on the head.</v>

5734
02:22:59.791 --> 02:23:00.624
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

5735
02:23:01.350 --> 02:23:02.910
<v Speaker 2>good job making that she didn't take it from here.</v>

5736
02:23:02.911 --> 02:23:03.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5737
02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:03.933
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5738
02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:06.870
<v Speaker 2>I see a new American US Logan,</v>

5739
02:23:06.871 --> 02:23:07.704
<v Speaker 2>we'll take it from here.</v>

5740
02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:08.970
<v Speaker 2>America blessed.</v>

5741
02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:09.121
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5742
02:23:09.121 --> 02:23:09.954
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

5743
02:23:10.170 --> 02:23:12.540
<v Speaker 2>Eh bless God.</v>

5744
02:23:12.541 --> 02:23:13.530
<v Speaker 2>I need you at my house.</v>

5745
02:23:13.560 --> 02:23:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Look at that fucking billboard.</v>

5746
02:23:15.930 --> 02:23:16.321
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

5747
02:23:16.321 --> 02:23:18.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a conti flying lizard.</v>

5748
02:23:20.190 --> 02:23:21.240
<v Speaker 2>If you ever met her lizard,</v>

5749
02:23:21.241 --> 02:23:21.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean a,</v>

5750
02:23:21.571 --> 02:23:22.250
<v Speaker 2>an eagle.</v>

5751
02:23:22.250 --> 02:23:22.440
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5752
02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:23.190
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen an eagle?</v>

5753
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:23.610
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5754
02:23:23.610 --> 02:23:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I saw one last summer for the first time in real life.</v>

5755
02:23:25.950 --> 02:23:28.110
<v Speaker 2>And you look into the eyes of that heartless monster.</v>

5756
02:23:28.111 --> 02:23:28.441
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

5757
02:23:28.441 --> 02:23:29.430
<v Speaker 2>well how the fuck is this?</v>

5758
02:23:29.431 --> 02:23:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Our National Bird?</v>

5759
02:23:30.890 --> 02:23:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5760
02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:32.460
<v Speaker 2>our national and crazy.</v>

5761
02:23:32.461 --> 02:23:32.851
<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>

5762
02:23:32.851 --> 02:23:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Or there dinosaurs,</v>

5763
02:23:35.170 --> 02:23:36.260
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs that survived.</v>

5764
02:23:36.390 --> 02:23:36.680
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

5765
02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:38.490
<v Speaker 2>if you pulled away all the feathers,</v>

5766
02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:39.380
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

5767
02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:39.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5768
02:23:39.690 --> 02:23:41.580
<v Speaker 2>they think that most dinosaurs had feathers.</v>

5769
02:23:41.581 --> 02:23:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Now they're starting to reconsider the idea of dinosaurs and feathers.</v>

5770
02:23:44.970 --> 02:23:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I do think a lot of dinosaurs had feathers,</v>

5771
02:23:46.531 --> 02:23:48.330
<v Speaker 2>so they essentially are fucking dinosaurs.</v>

5772
02:23:48.390 --> 02:23:51.600
<v Speaker 2>So that gives Steven Spielberg way to rerelease all the Jurassic Park movies</v>

5773
02:23:51.630 --> 02:23:51.871
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

5774
02:23:51.871 --> 02:23:52.531
<v Speaker 2>which feathers,</v>

5775
02:23:52.531 --> 02:23:54.450
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what the fuck was on those things.</v>

5776
02:23:54.450 --> 02:23:55.860
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what color they were.</v>

5777
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:57.600
<v Speaker 2>They know they had some sort of skin,</v>

5778
02:23:57.810 --> 02:23:58.800
<v Speaker 2>but all they have is bones.</v>

5779
02:23:58.801 --> 02:23:59.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's speculation,</v>

5780
02:23:59.791 --> 02:24:00.900
<v Speaker 2>but in more,</v>

5781
02:24:00.901 --> 02:24:01.530
<v Speaker 2>and we like,</v>

5782
02:24:01.530 --> 02:24:03.100
<v Speaker 2>we like to think our lizards are green,</v>

5783
02:24:03.101 --> 02:24:03.651
<v Speaker 2>so we just make it.</v>

5784
02:24:03.651 --> 02:24:04.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5785
02:24:04.010 --> 02:24:04.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5786
02:24:04.590 --> 02:24:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Well they also think that at t rex might've been like vulture shaped or vulture</v>

5787
02:24:08.371 --> 02:24:08.701
<v Speaker 2>colored,</v>

5788
02:24:08.701 --> 02:24:12.570
<v Speaker 2>like bright red faced and black body because they think that he might've been</v>

5789
02:24:12.571 --> 02:24:16.020
<v Speaker 2>like intimidating because they think he was more of a,</v>

5790
02:24:16.530 --> 02:24:19.260
<v Speaker 2>they think it was more of instead of a Predator,</v>

5791
02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:20.850
<v Speaker 2>he was more of a carrion eater.</v>

5792
02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:21.121
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

5793
02:24:21.121 --> 02:24:25.260
<v Speaker 2>he probably stole away from somebody else who killed it because his body's all</v>

5794
02:24:25.261 --> 02:24:27.000
<v Speaker 2>fucked up the way it doesn't have.</v>

5795
02:24:27.001 --> 02:24:28.650
<v Speaker 2>The arms can't really run that good.</v>

5796
02:24:28.651 --> 02:24:28.830
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

5797
02:24:28.830 --> 02:24:33.830
<v Speaker 2>and they also speculate about the earth's atmosphere being different than,</v>

5798
02:24:34.060 --> 02:24:36.030
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the reasons why things grew so big.</v>

5799
02:24:36.031 --> 02:24:38.670
<v Speaker 2>It was a more oxygen rich and dense atmosphere,</v>

5800
02:24:39.210 --> 02:24:42.090
<v Speaker 2>but they think that there's a lot of dinosaurs had feathers,</v>

5801
02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:44.220
<v Speaker 2>so a fucking eagle is a dinosaur.</v>

5802
02:24:44.890 --> 02:24:48.240
<v Speaker 2>So when you're looking at that thing with a bolt cutter for a face,</v>

5803
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:53.370
<v Speaker 2>like how was this heartless evil baby steel and flying monster,</v>

5804
02:24:54.210 --> 02:24:54.900
<v Speaker 2>that's us.</v>

5805
02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:55.733
<v Speaker 2>That's America.</v>

5806
02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:57.031
<v Speaker 2>There's some about that.</v>

5807
02:24:57.031 --> 02:24:57.930
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like America.</v>

5808
02:25:01.300 --> 02:25:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like an eagle flying into the Foxconn factory in China and sweeping up</v>

5809
02:25:05.671 --> 02:25:07.050
<v Speaker 2>the iPhone and taking him away.</v>

5810
02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:11.070
<v Speaker 2>That sounds kind of like us and the baby in one hand just fucking drops it in</v>

5811
02:25:11.071 --> 02:25:11.640
<v Speaker 2>the ocean.</v>

5812
02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5813
02:25:12.250 --> 02:25:13.920
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of a thing that happens.</v>

5814
02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Talens is big,</v>

5815
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:18.640
<v Speaker 2>long or so that you're not male fish never,</v>

5816
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:19.770
<v Speaker 2>which not mentioning Joe's,</v>

5817
02:25:20.190 --> 02:25:22.650
<v Speaker 2>that's cavemen were also living with them at the same time.</v>

5818
02:25:22.651 --> 02:25:23.530
<v Speaker 2>If you go to the writing,</v>

5819
02:25:23.570 --> 02:25:24.310
<v Speaker 2>you go to the creation</v>

5820
02:25:24.310 --> 02:25:24.790
<v Speaker 1>museum.</v>

5821
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Have you been,</v>

5822
02:25:25.390 --> 02:25:27.520
<v Speaker 1>I know I've been to that area and heard about it,</v>

5823
02:25:27.521 --> 02:25:27.880
<v Speaker 1>but right.</v>

5824
02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:28.430
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

5825
02:25:28.430 --> 02:25:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5826
02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:31.180
<v Speaker 1>The creation museum is supposed to be so awesome.</v>

5827
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:32.710
<v Speaker 1>They have like these,</v>

5828
02:25:32.770 --> 02:25:33.670
<v Speaker 1>these lectures,</v>

5829
02:25:33.671 --> 02:25:38.510
<v Speaker 1>they explain how dinosaurs were mentioned in the Bible and how yeah,</v>

5830
02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:40.180
<v Speaker 1>and how they were all here together.</v>

5831
02:25:40.210 --> 02:25:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Did Noah forget them?</v>

5832
02:25:41.141 --> 02:25:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Is that what happened?</v>

5833
02:25:41.950 --> 02:25:42.950
<v Speaker 1>They forgot them.</v>

5834
02:25:43.070 --> 02:25:45.660
<v Speaker 1>He was on the blowers were late shit to dinosaurs.</v>

5835
02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaurs,</v>

5836
02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:48.050
<v Speaker 1>that dinosaur people time and</v>

5837
02:25:51.100 --> 02:25:51.641
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5838
02:25:51.641 --> 02:25:52.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5839
02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:52.670
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5840
02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:57.010
<v Speaker 1>I love when people get wacky ideas like that in their head and they just ride</v>

5841
02:25:57.011 --> 02:25:58.600
<v Speaker 1>them out to the very end.</v>

5842
02:25:58.660 --> 02:26:02.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so funny because people think that they're supposed to be able to</v>

5843
02:26:02.111 --> 02:26:04.570
<v Speaker 1>feed some people and especially in religion it's sort of,</v>

5844
02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:05.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5845
02:26:05.140 --> 02:26:07.330
<v Speaker 1>think they're supposed to have be able to figure everything out.</v>

5846
02:26:07.750 --> 02:26:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Well no I can.</v>

5847
02:26:08.670 --> 02:26:09.040
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>

5848
02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Everything should be easily explained to them and everything.</v>

5849
02:26:10.871 --> 02:26:11.381
<v Speaker 1>She'd be like,</v>

5850
02:26:11.381 --> 02:26:11.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5851
02:26:11.610 --> 02:26:13.260
<v Speaker 1>the most shit doesn't make sense.</v>

5852
02:26:13.261 --> 02:26:14.140
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't make sense to you.</v>

5853
02:26:14.350 --> 02:26:15.071
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to make,</v>

5854
02:26:15.071 --> 02:26:15.910
<v Speaker 1>so you have a job.</v>

5855
02:26:15.911 --> 02:26:17.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that's supposed to make sense to you,</v>

5856
02:26:17.321 --> 02:26:18.041
<v Speaker 1>but everything else,</v>

5857
02:26:18.041 --> 02:26:20.950
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to know the why things work the way they are.</v>

5858
02:26:20.951 --> 02:26:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Unless that's your job.</v>

5859
02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Well that's science,</v>

5860
02:26:23.261 --> 02:26:23.860
<v Speaker 1>handle it.</v>

5861
02:26:23.860 --> 02:26:26.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people working on that shit is also a lot of people that like</v>

5862
02:26:26.261 --> 02:26:27.094
<v Speaker 1>an attribute,</v>

5863
02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:32.460
<v Speaker 1>like really complex mechanisms to like impossibility.</v>

5864
02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:33.281
<v Speaker 1>Like they say,</v>

5865
02:26:33.281 --> 02:26:38.281
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me that six 14 whatever it was billion years ago,</v>

5866
02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:44.820
<v Speaker 1>something created the universe add a nothing and then from there you can see</v>

5867
02:26:46.151 --> 02:26:47.440
<v Speaker 1>with your eyes like,</v>

5868
02:26:47.470 --> 02:26:48.303
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5869
02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:49.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean man,</v>

5870
02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:50.291
<v Speaker 1>where are we?</v>

5871
02:26:50.291 --> 02:26:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Begin?</v>

5872
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:51.250
<v Speaker 1>You want to go?</v>

5873
02:26:51.250 --> 02:26:51.581
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

5874
02:26:51.581 --> 02:26:52.280
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm telling you.</v>

5875
02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:52.871
<v Speaker 1>Next question.</v>

5876
02:26:52.871 --> 02:26:53.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you're saying,</v>

5877
02:26:53.890 --> 02:26:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I could never make a cell phone.</v>

5878
02:26:55.450 --> 02:26:57.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's in the cell phone show you do.</v>

5879
02:26:57.790 --> 02:26:59.160
<v Speaker 1>You just got to do the work.</v>

5880
02:26:59.210 --> 02:26:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5881
02:26:59.410 --> 02:26:59.951
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I'm saying.</v>

5882
02:26:59.951 --> 02:27:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Like I couldn't,</v>

5883
02:27:00.850 --> 02:27:01.180
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

5884
02:27:01.180 --> 02:27:05.200
<v Speaker 1>if somebody brought me all the parts and said put it together and I don't,</v>

5885
02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to know how to do it to believe that,</v>

5886
02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:07.930
<v Speaker 1>that it's doing the job.</v>

5887
02:27:07.931 --> 02:27:11.170
<v Speaker 1>But some people need to act like they need to know how thing works for it to</v>

5888
02:27:11.171 --> 02:27:11.740
<v Speaker 1>make sense.</v>

5889
02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:12.071
<v Speaker 1>They need,</v>

5890
02:27:12.071 --> 02:27:12.940
<v Speaker 1>it needs to make sense to them.</v>

5891
02:27:12.941 --> 02:27:13.061
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

5892
02:27:13.061 --> 02:27:13.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5893
02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:14.740
<v Speaker 1>you didn't study that.</v>

5894
02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5895
02:27:15.500 --> 02:27:19.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't know that what you're telling me a single celled organism can become a</v>

5896
02:27:19.571 --> 02:27:20.230
<v Speaker 1>giraffe.</v>

5897
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.531
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

5898
02:27:20.531 --> 02:27:20.861
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

5899
02:27:20.861 --> 02:27:21.694
<v Speaker 1>Next question.</v>

5900
02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5901
02:27:22.990 --> 02:27:24.420
<v Speaker 1>It takes millions of years fucker.</v>

5902
02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Or don't worry about it.</v>

5903
02:27:25.481 --> 02:27:26.314
<v Speaker 1>Let the people who were,</v>

5904
02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:27.270
<v Speaker 1>who went to college,</v>

5905
02:27:27.270 --> 02:27:30.310
<v Speaker 1>and I trust them because they're all liberals,</v>

5906
02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:33.070
<v Speaker 1>liberals in the queer lover,</v>

5907
02:27:33.071 --> 02:27:34.690
<v Speaker 1>and those liberals brought you your iPhone.</v>

5908
02:27:34.690 --> 02:27:35.590
<v Speaker 1>You're not worried about that.</v>

5909
02:27:35.591 --> 02:27:36.580
<v Speaker 1>So it just is true.</v>

5910
02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:37.473
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

5911
02:27:37.690 --> 02:27:40.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not a lot of conservative think tanks creating the most innovative new cell</v>

5912
02:27:40.871 --> 02:27:41.704
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>

5913
02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:42.130
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5914
02:27:42.130 --> 02:27:42.311
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5915
02:27:42.311 --> 02:27:43.144
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

5916
02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:44.061
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing.</v>

5917
02:27:44.061 --> 02:27:44.290
<v Speaker 1>And they'll,</v>

5918
02:27:44.290 --> 02:27:48.190
<v Speaker 1>a comforting thing that I like about a lot of these internet based tech based</v>

5919
02:27:48.191 --> 02:27:48.970
<v Speaker 1>businesses,</v>

5920
02:27:48.970 --> 02:27:50.890
<v Speaker 1>they seem to be very ethical and moral.</v>

5921
02:27:51.130 --> 02:27:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Like they seem to have a connect like Google,</v>

5922
02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:56.350
<v Speaker 1>especially Google and a lot of these companies they,</v>

5923
02:27:56.351 --> 02:27:56.800
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

5924
02:27:56.800 --> 02:28:01.800
<v Speaker 1>they're way more open and way more intelligent about their approach to ethics</v>

5925
02:28:02.441 --> 02:28:03.130
<v Speaker 1>and morals.</v>

5926
02:28:03.130 --> 02:28:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Then a lot of like other corporations.</v>

5927
02:28:05.650 --> 02:28:06.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5928
02:28:06.011 --> 02:28:07.600
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's probably like if,</v>

5929
02:28:07.630 --> 02:28:08.020
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

5930
02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:08.351
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

5931
02:28:08.351 --> 02:28:09.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5932
02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:09.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5933
02:28:09.431 --> 02:28:11.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if Walmart is way over here is not ethical,</v>

5934
02:28:11.501 --> 02:28:12.190
<v Speaker 1>moral,</v>

5935
02:28:12.190 --> 02:28:12.521
<v Speaker 1>moral.</v>

5936
02:28:12.521 --> 02:28:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Some people would say that Facebook is here.</v>

5937
02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:17.000
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't say it's like all the way up to the other Facebook.</v>

5938
02:28:17.020 --> 02:28:17.853
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky.</v>

5939
02:28:18.090 --> 02:28:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5940
02:28:18.340 --> 02:28:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Facebook.</v>

5941
02:28:18.730 --> 02:28:18.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5942
02:28:18.851 --> 02:28:19.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that like,</v>

5943
02:28:19.660 --> 02:28:19.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5944
02:28:19.871 --> 02:28:20.230
<v Speaker 1>they own,</v>

5945
02:28:20.230 --> 02:28:21.620
<v Speaker 1>they own all their information.</v>

5946
02:28:21.621 --> 02:28:24.830
<v Speaker 1>They have like they sell it to and they sell it and they make,</v>

5947
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:25.460
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

5948
02:28:25.460 --> 02:28:27.590
<v Speaker 1>how does this make money if I'm not paying for it?</v>

5949
02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:31.090
<v Speaker 1>How's the weird thing when you go to Google search something and it shows you</v>

5950
02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:34.100
<v Speaker 1>like all sorts of other shit that you might be interested in on the right hand</v>

5951
02:28:34.101 --> 02:28:34.401
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

5952
02:28:34.401 --> 02:28:34.701
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

5953
02:28:34.701 --> 02:28:35.330
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

5954
02:28:35.330 --> 02:28:39.050
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck do you know what I like or the new thing where they show like I go,</v>

5955
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:41.060
<v Speaker 1>I looked up a heavy,</v>

5956
02:28:41.061 --> 02:28:42.080
<v Speaker 1>like a punching bag.</v>

5957
02:28:42.110 --> 02:28:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Like I was thinking of buying a,</v>

5958
02:28:43.161 --> 02:28:43.401
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5959
02:28:43.401 --> 02:28:43.521
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5960
02:28:43.521 --> 02:28:44.354
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll buy about punching back.</v>

5961
02:28:44.510 --> 02:28:47.360
<v Speaker 1>And now every time I go to websites and being advertised for Everlast bags,</v>

5962
02:28:47.361 --> 02:28:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5963
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:50.870
<v Speaker 1>that one time I did a half hour looking at punching bags went,</v>

5964
02:28:50.871 --> 02:28:51.081
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

5965
02:28:51.081 --> 02:28:51.530
<v Speaker 1>it's dumb.</v>

5966
02:28:51.530 --> 02:28:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that.</v>

5967
02:28:52.310 --> 02:28:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Can you just dump your cookies or something like that and that,</v>

5968
02:28:54.441 --> 02:28:54.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5969
02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:55.491
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could,</v>

5970
02:28:55.491 --> 02:28:57.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's just that thing that I don't think about until I'm like,</v>

5971
02:28:57.351 --> 02:28:59.000
<v Speaker 1>why is it telling me that or,</v>

5972
02:28:59.001 --> 02:28:59.181
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5973
02:28:59.181 --> 02:29:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Why is it telling me about like I've made a reservation at a,</v>

5974
02:29:01.890 --> 02:29:02.810
<v Speaker 1>this happened this week.</v>

5975
02:29:02.811 --> 02:29:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I made a reservation at this hotel I'm staying at now.</v>

5976
02:29:05.211 --> 02:29:07.760
<v Speaker 1>My computer's advertising me to stay at the hotel I'm staying at.</v>

5977
02:29:09.350 --> 02:29:10.183
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

5978
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:11.383
<v Speaker 1>You already got me.</v>

5979
02:29:11.390 --> 02:29:12.350
<v Speaker 1>They already got my money.</v>

5980
02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:12.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5981
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:13.011
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to,</v>

5982
02:29:13.011 --> 02:29:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm already staying there.</v>

5983
02:29:14.180 --> 02:29:14.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5984
02:29:14.361 --> 02:29:17.690
<v Speaker 1>it gets even weirder when you have a Google phone because when you have a Google</v>

5985
02:29:17.691 --> 02:29:18.200
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

5986
02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:21.500
<v Speaker 1>it'll tell you like you look something up and I'll show you like how many</v>

5987
02:29:21.501 --> 02:29:22.790
<v Speaker 1>minutes that is from your home.</v>

5988
02:29:23.450 --> 02:29:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Do you know where I live?</v>

5989
02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5990
02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:25.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5991
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.401
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5992
02:29:25.401 --> 02:29:25.611
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5993
02:29:25.611 --> 02:29:27.140
<v Speaker 1>it knows where you go every night.</v>

5994
02:29:27.141 --> 02:29:28.970
<v Speaker 1>So it's soon as soon as that's your home,</v>

5995
02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:31.610
<v Speaker 1>so it tracks that down and then where you are,</v>

5996
02:29:31.611 --> 02:29:32.840
<v Speaker 1>you're 23 minutes from your home.</v>

5997
02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:33.471
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

5998
02:29:33.471 --> 02:29:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you know where I live?</v>

5999
02:29:34.660 --> 02:29:36.200
<v Speaker 1>You should leave for work now.</v>

6000
02:29:37.910 --> 02:29:38.743
<v Speaker 1>What are you telling me?</v>

6001
02:29:38.810 --> 02:29:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Or the thing that I find with my Google phone,</v>

6002
02:29:40.521 --> 02:29:44.690
<v Speaker 1>the technology is still not working the way I will Google something like in La,</v>

6003
02:29:44.900 --> 02:29:45.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

6004
02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:45.291
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

6005
02:29:45.291 --> 02:29:45.861
<v Speaker 1>where's that thing?</v>

6006
02:29:45.861 --> 02:29:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Just something that's not even,</v>

6007
02:29:46.940 --> 02:29:47.420
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

6008
02:29:47.420 --> 02:29:47.541
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

6009
02:29:47.541 --> 02:29:48.081
<v Speaker 1>where's that thing?</v>

6010
02:29:48.081 --> 02:29:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm curious if were to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

6012
02:29:49.310 --> 02:29:49.820
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

6013
02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:51.890
<v Speaker 1>if then I was in San Diego a couple days ago and it was like,</v>

6014
02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:53.390
<v Speaker 1>it's four hours to that location.</v>

6015
02:29:53.391 --> 02:29:54.560
<v Speaker 1>You googled in Los Angeles.</v>

6016

<v Speaker 1>Like why would I need to know that now I'm not,</v>

6017
02:29:57.320 --> 02:29:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going there.</v>

6018
02:29:58.341 --> 02:30:00.950
<v Speaker 1>You're just telling me four hours.</v>

6019
02:30:01.480 --> 02:30:03.920
<v Speaker 1>They'd slowly starting to get smart.</v>

6020
02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:05.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's not quite there,</v>

6022
02:30:06.680 --> 02:30:08.170
<v Speaker 1>but if it does get too smart you,</v>

6023
02:30:08.180 --> 02:30:12.170
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be so intrusive or or I have to say convenient.</v>

02:30:36.141 --> 02:30:37.220
<v Speaker 1>That's what this is all about.</v>

6051
02:30:37.490 --> 02:30:38.610
<v Speaker 1>That in a lot of ways.</v>

6052
02:30:38.620 --> 02:30:40.550
<v Speaker 1>In some ways you're saying we're getting,</v>

6053
02:30:40.551 --> 02:30:40.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6054
02:30:40.730 --> 02:30:41.960
<v Speaker 1>people say we're giving up privacy,</v>

6055
02:30:41.961 --> 02:30:42.650
<v Speaker 1>but people are like,</v>

6056
02:30:42.650 --> 02:30:46.310
<v Speaker 1>people are willing to give up privacy if it comes with a coupon and a f in some</v>

6057
02:30:46.311 --> 02:30:46.910
<v Speaker 1>free stuff.</v>

6058
02:30:46.910 --> 02:30:47.431
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

6059
02:30:47.431 --> 02:30:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Until it bites him in the ass until it bites him in the ass.</v>

6060
02:30:50.241 --> 02:30:50.931
<v Speaker 1>And that's the question.</v>

6061
02:30:50.931 --> 02:30:53.120
<v Speaker 1>We all have a different place where we were our asses,</v>

6062
02:30:54.290 --> 02:30:56.510
<v Speaker 1>we all have different size and shaped acids and I was like,</v>

6063
02:30:56.511 --> 02:30:57.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not biting me in the ass shit.</v>

6064
02:30:57.501 --> 02:30:58.010
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

6065
02:30:58.010 --> 02:30:58.620
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

6066
02:30:58.620 --> 02:30:59.390
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

6067
02:30:59.390 --> 02:31:00.290
<v Speaker 1>the thing with the NSA,</v>

6068
02:31:00.291 --> 02:31:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like we,</v>

6069
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.210
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to say they stay trolled all our data when we're the ones who said</v>

6070
02:31:05.211 --> 02:31:06.530
<v Speaker 1>here he would you like our name?</v>

6071
02:31:06.531 --> 02:31:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Would you like to data true?</v>

6072
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:08.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6073
02:31:08.240 --> 02:31:11.810
<v Speaker 1>you download candy crush to your phone and you think I'm just playing a fun game</v>

6074
02:31:11.811 --> 02:31:12.231
<v Speaker 1>for free.</v>

6075
02:31:12.231 --> 02:31:12.651
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

6076
02:31:12.651 --> 02:31:12.891
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6077
02:31:12.891 --> 02:31:14.120
<v Speaker 1>it's knows where you are now.</v>

6078
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:18.080
<v Speaker 1>But the real problem is that I let you know that the government was able to read</v>

6079
02:31:18.081 --> 02:31:20.250
<v Speaker 1>your emails anytime want these workers</v>

6080
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:22.470
<v Speaker 2>could just like download your Dick Pics.</v>

6081
02:31:22.500 --> 02:31:23.730
<v Speaker 2>This is fun to send them off.</v>

6082
02:31:24.930 --> 02:31:26.760
<v Speaker 2>And Edward Snowden is telling the truth.</v>

6083
02:31:26.761 --> 02:31:27.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously I don't know,</v>

6084
02:31:27.781 --> 02:31:31.560
<v Speaker 2>but he said that there's people in his office that were downloading emails from</v>

6085
02:31:31.561 --> 02:31:34.560
<v Speaker 2>ex girlfriends and shit and sharing photos and stuff.</v>

6086
02:31:35.130 --> 02:31:36.540
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you say like,</v>

6087
02:31:36.541 --> 02:31:37.351
<v Speaker 2>people didn't know that.</v>

6088
02:31:37.351 --> 02:31:40.830
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like every black barbershop around the country has been talking about</v>

6089
02:31:40.831 --> 02:31:41.581
<v Speaker 2>that shit for years.</v>

6090
02:31:41.581 --> 02:31:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Black people have always been like the CIA,</v>

6091
02:31:42.940 --> 02:31:43.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6092
02:31:43.131 --> 02:31:44.250
<v Speaker 2>the ca and Vinod crack,</v>

6093
02:31:44.251 --> 02:31:44.671
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

6094
02:31:44.671 --> 02:31:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Like that level of like we're being watched at all times because every time I</v>

6095
02:31:48.301 --> 02:31:50.640
<v Speaker 2>walk into a store there literally is a guy watching me.</v>

6096
02:31:50.641 --> 02:31:51.181
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

6097
02:31:51.181 --> 02:31:52.350
<v Speaker 2>So I think in the black community,</v>

6098
02:31:52.351 --> 02:31:54.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the NSA story was as big of a Oh yeah,</v>

6099
02:31:54.781 --> 02:31:55.660
<v Speaker 2>the government's watching us.</v>

6100
02:31:55.660 --> 02:31:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6101
02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:58.350
<v Speaker 2>The black community and the truth or community should get together.</v>

6102
02:31:58.570 --> 02:32:01.590
<v Speaker 2>That never seems to work out because the truth of committee goes,</v>

6103
02:32:01.591 --> 02:32:02.550
<v Speaker 2>there was no slavery.</v>

6104
02:32:02.551 --> 02:32:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6105
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:03.960
<v Speaker 2>All right guys.</v>

6106
02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:05.790
<v Speaker 2>I had a CIA guy in here,</v>

6107
02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:06.840
<v Speaker 2>former CIA,</v>

6108
02:32:07.260 --> 02:32:08.430
<v Speaker 2>director of operations,</v>

6109
02:32:08.431 --> 02:32:08.881
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck.</v>

6110
02:32:08.881 --> 02:32:09.870
<v Speaker 2>He was really nice guy.</v>

6111
02:32:09.871 --> 02:32:11.070
<v Speaker 2>But I played him,</v>

6112
02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:14.460
<v Speaker 2>this Guy Michael Rupert talking about how they were selling drugs and he was a</v>

6113
02:32:14.461 --> 02:32:17.040
<v Speaker 2>former La narcotics officer who,</v>

6114
02:32:17.041 --> 02:32:17.874
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6115
02:32:18.080 --> 02:32:23.080
<v Speaker 2>like literally caught the CIA selling drugs in black communities and was direct.</v>

6116
02:32:23.431 --> 02:32:26.400
<v Speaker 2>It was addressing the director of the CIA at the time.</v>

6117
02:32:26.401 --> 02:32:30.330
<v Speaker 2>He got fired right after this and I played it for him on the podcast and just</v>

6118
02:32:30.331 --> 02:32:31.290
<v Speaker 2>watching them try to</v>

6119
02:32:33.570 --> 02:32:34.500
<v Speaker 2>dance around it.</v>

6120
02:32:36.020 --> 02:32:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6121
02:32:36.430 --> 02:32:37.263
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6122
02:32:37.380 --> 02:32:38.040
<v Speaker 2>we didn't even,</v>

6123
02:32:38.040 --> 02:32:39.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean I let it go after awhile,</v>

6124
02:32:39.870 --> 02:32:44.870
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't even get into like Gary Webb or any of the cocaine plane that had</v>

6125
02:32:44.941 --> 02:32:46.620
<v Speaker 2>been to Guantanamo Bay twice.</v>

6126
02:32:46.620 --> 02:32:49.680
<v Speaker 2>It crashed with tons of cocaine in it.</v>

6127
02:32:50.220 --> 02:32:51.053
<v Speaker 2>In Mexico.</v>

6128
02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6129
02:32:51.200 --> 02:32:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Mean there's a lot of evidence that the CIA might've been involved in some form</v>

6130
02:32:55.021 --> 02:32:56.520
<v Speaker 2>or someone in the CIA.</v>

6131
02:32:56.820 --> 02:32:57.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6132
02:32:57.210 --> 02:32:57.751
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

6133
02:32:57.751 --> 02:32:57.961
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6134
02:32:57.961 --> 02:32:58.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6135
02:32:58.750 --> 02:32:59.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

6136
02:32:59.130 --> 02:32:59.963
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the,</v>

6137
02:33:00.210 --> 02:33:01.043
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

6138
02:33:01.310 --> 02:33:01.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6139
02:33:01.780 --> 02:33:04.710
<v Speaker 2>the black people can't flood the ghetto with drugs.</v>

6140
02:33:05.420 --> 02:33:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6141
02:33:05.950 --> 02:33:06.331
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

6142
02:33:06.331 --> 02:33:06.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6143
02:33:06.740 --> 02:33:07.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6144
02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:08.550
<v Speaker 2>every now and again there's a,</v>

6145
02:33:08.790 --> 02:33:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Rick freeway were awesome,</v>

6146
02:33:09.950 --> 02:33:10.511
<v Speaker 2>but there's not,</v>

6147
02:33:10.511 --> 02:33:10.780
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

6148
02:33:10.780 --> 02:33:12.390
<v Speaker 2>that was the guy that I had on the podcast,</v>

6149
02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:12.991
<v Speaker 2>a freeway,</v>

6150
02:33:12.991 --> 02:33:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Ricky on it three times.</v>

6151
02:33:14.370 --> 02:33:18.270
<v Speaker 2>And one of the Times that I had him on was he discussed how he got into a</v>

6152
02:33:18.271 --> 02:33:21.600
<v Speaker 2>connection with this guy who was directly sending the profits to the fucking</v>

6153
02:33:21.601 --> 02:33:22.434
<v Speaker 2>contrast.</v>

6154
02:33:22.450 --> 02:33:23.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

6155
02:33:23.130 --> 02:33:26.370
<v Speaker 2>the whole contras and Sandinistas thing in Nicaragua,</v>

6156
02:33:26.580 --> 02:33:30.360
<v Speaker 2>which was the Oliver North scandal that was on television was all at our</v>

6157
02:33:30.361 --> 02:33:30.810
<v Speaker 2>freeway.</v>

6158
02:33:30.810 --> 02:33:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Ricky selling coke and it's incredible and yet you feel like a little bit,</v>

6159
02:33:35.491 --> 02:33:38.440
<v Speaker 2>I feel like at least at least the black guy made some money off of that.</v>

6160
02:33:39.180 --> 02:33:39.421
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6161
02:33:39.421 --> 02:33:39.631
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6162
02:33:39.631 --> 02:33:40.590
<v Speaker 2>not certainly he,</v>

6163
02:33:40.591 --> 02:33:41.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he would do it all again.</v>

6164
02:33:42.060 --> 02:33:42.893
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't.</v>

6165
02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:43.920
<v Speaker 2>He definitely wouldn't.</v>

6166
02:33:43.921 --> 02:33:45.390
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting guy.</v>

6167
02:33:45.450 --> 02:33:46.120
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

6168
02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:47.340
<v Speaker 2>he's learned a lot from it.</v>

6169
02:33:47.370 --> 02:33:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean he taught himself how to read in jail once he was arrested for that and</v>

6170
02:33:50.841 --> 02:33:55.590
<v Speaker 2>then found a loophole in the argument that got him arrested for three strikes</v>

6171
02:33:55.770 --> 02:33:59.100
<v Speaker 2>because it's supposed to be three different charges and he got two kids.</v>

6172
02:33:59.101 --> 02:34:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Two different charges was one was one time he was arrested and that doesn't</v>

6173
02:34:03.541 --> 02:34:05.220
<v Speaker 2>count as the three strikes law.</v>

6174
02:34:05.221 --> 02:34:06.300
<v Speaker 2>So they had to let him out.</v>

6175
02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:08.100
<v Speaker 2>He was going to be in jail for the rest of his life.</v>

6176
02:34:08.101 --> 02:34:12.090
<v Speaker 2>He figured that out on his own after he learned how to read in jail.</v>

6177
02:34:12.140 --> 02:34:12.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6178
02:34:13.170 --> 02:34:13.801
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>

6179
02:34:13.801 --> 02:34:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

6180
02:34:14.130 --> 02:34:14.731
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny,</v>

6181
02:34:14.731 --> 02:34:17.290
<v Speaker 2>I met him at a party one time and it was when I had the show.</v>

6182
02:34:17.291 --> 02:34:18.160
<v Speaker 2>And so when I had the show,</v>

6183
02:34:18.161 --> 02:34:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I would get like a tension for people who normally wouldn't talk to me.</v>

6184
02:34:20.861 --> 02:34:21.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6185
02:34:21.071 --> 02:34:21.640
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

6186
02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:22.330
<v Speaker 2>I met him at a party,</v>

6187
02:34:22.330 --> 02:34:22.961
<v Speaker 2>he was very nice,</v>

6188
02:34:22.961 --> 02:34:23.560
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>

6189
02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:23.831
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

6190
02:34:23.831 --> 02:34:24.101
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

6191

02:34:35.350 --> 02:34:37.990

6200
02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6205
02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:41.021
<v Speaker 2>very interesting.</v>

6206
02:34:41.021 --> 02:34:41.890
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting guy,</v>

6207

6210
02:34:43.541 --> 02:34:43.751
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6211
02:34:43.751 --> 02:34:46.540
<v Speaker 2>he really did have a multi,</v>

6212
02:34:46.541 --> 02:34:47.171
<v Speaker 2>multi,</v>

6213
02:34:47.171 --> 02:34:52.171
<v Speaker 2>multimillion dollar cocaine industry and it was really going to the government.</v>

6214
02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6215
02:34:52.660 --> 02:34:52.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6216
02:34:52.991 --> 02:34:53.800
<v Speaker 2>that's a fact.</v>

6217
02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:54.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6218
02:34:54.011 --> 02:34:54.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6219
02:34:54.370 --> 02:34:55.001
<v Speaker 2>and I feel like,</v>

6220
02:34:55.001 --> 02:34:55.271
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

6221
02:34:55.271 --> 02:34:57.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a person who sent in a lot of black barbershops in the basement of</v>

6222
02:34:57.971 --> 02:34:58.321
<v Speaker 2>churches.</v>

6223
02:34:58.321 --> 02:34:58.511
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

6224
02:34:58.511 --> 02:34:58.661
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6225
02:34:58.661 --> 02:34:59.494
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to tell me.</v>

6226
02:34:59.910 --> 02:35:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6227
02:35:00.580 --> 02:35:01.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6228
02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

6229
02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:04.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in a lot of conspiracy theories,</v>

6230
02:35:04.031 --> 02:35:04.601
<v Speaker 2>but that to me,</v>

6231
02:35:04.601 --> 02:35:06.070
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't feel like a conspiracy theory.</v>

6232
02:35:06.130 --> 02:35:06.611
<v Speaker 2>That feels like,</v>

6233
02:35:06.611 --> 02:35:06.701
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6234
02:35:06.701 --> 02:35:07.091
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

6235
02:35:07.091 --> 02:35:10.600
<v Speaker 2>How else would you get cocaine and crack in the ghetto unless somebody was</v>

6236
02:35:10.601 --> 02:35:13.360
<v Speaker 2>greasing the palms to make that happen and that person worked in the government.</v>

6237
02:35:13.361 --> 02:35:14.080
<v Speaker 2>That was the government.</v>

6238
02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:14.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6239
02:35:14.381 --> 02:35:15.011
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

6240
02:35:15.011 --> 02:35:18.160
<v Speaker 2>if I was sitting around the government and I was sitting around with a bunch of</v>

6241
02:35:18.910 --> 02:35:21.340

6248
02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:27.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6249
02:35:27.430 --> 02:35:28.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of code.</v>

6250
02:35:28.060 --> 02:35:29.170
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to stop that.</v>

6251
02:35:29.230 --> 02:35:29.531
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6252
02:35:29.531 --> 02:35:30.364
<v Speaker 2>They're going to always,</v>

6253
02:35:30.370 --> 02:35:31.810
<v Speaker 2>so who's going to make this money?</v>

6254
02:35:31.811 --> 02:35:32.644
<v Speaker 2>Do we want the,</v>

6255
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:35.680
<v Speaker 2>the fucking Colombians to make them money or should we just make the money?</v>

6256
02:35:36.220 --> 02:35:37.053
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6257
02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:37.910
<v Speaker 2>we should probably make the money.</v>

6258
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6259
02:35:38.090 --> 02:35:38.920
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to,</v>

6260
02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:39.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6261
02:35:39.290 --> 02:35:40.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to stop coke,</v>

6262
02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:41.553
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like,</v>

6263
02:35:41.740 --> 02:35:42.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they even have the,</v>

6264
02:35:42.791 --> 02:35:44.440
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to stop at Congress and he'd be like,</v>

6265
02:35:44.470 --> 02:35:45.850
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's like a new stock thing.</v>

6266
02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:46.181
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

6267
02:35:46.181 --> 02:35:46.961
<v Speaker 2>coke's making along the way.</v>

6268
02:35:46.961 --> 02:35:47.771
<v Speaker 2>Listen to this than that.</v>

6269
02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:48.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like it gets to the,</v>

6270
02:35:49.210 --> 02:35:49.421
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

6271
02:35:49.421 --> 02:35:50.950
<v Speaker 2>we can't stop the people from,</v>

6272
02:35:51.010 --> 02:35:51.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6273
02:35:51.411 --> 02:35:51.520
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

6274
02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:54.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's that godfather discussion where like they're animals anyway,</v>

6275
02:35:54.221 --> 02:35:55.740
<v Speaker 2>let them destroy themselves and it's like,</v>

6276
02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:56.081
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6277
02:35:56.081 --> 02:35:56.891
<v Speaker 2>that's making a lot of money.</v>

6278
02:35:56.891 --> 02:35:57.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like some lose this.</v>

6279
02:35:57.880 --> 02:35:58.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>

6280
02:35:58.890 --> 02:35:59.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6281
02:35:59.290 --> 02:36:00.310
<v Speaker 2>it's apples making money.</v>

6282
02:36:00.311 --> 02:36:01.061
<v Speaker 2>We should invest in that.</v>

6283
02:36:01.061 --> 02:36:02.620
<v Speaker 2>And cocaine in the ghettos making money.</v>

6284
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6285
02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Actually that the big impediment,</v>

6286
02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:06.850
<v Speaker 2>like what's the big problem as law enforcement?</v>

6287
02:36:07.060 --> 02:36:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6288
02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:10.620
<v Speaker 2>that we got that we got that you're going to be fine.</v>

6289
02:36:11.170 --> 02:36:11.500
<v Speaker 2>We had,</v>

6290
02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:12.140
<v Speaker 2>we already have that.</v>

6291
02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:12.930
<v Speaker 2>We already have that in,</v>

6292
02:36:12.930 --> 02:36:13.751
<v Speaker 2>well that's from Michael.</v>

6293
02:36:13.751 --> 02:36:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Rupert stepped up because he was a former La narcotics officer.</v>

6294
02:36:17.530 --> 02:36:22.530
<v Speaker 2>He was a guy who was involved in busting cases and he told his story in no</v>

6295
02:36:23.591 --> 02:36:28.591
<v Speaker 2>uncertain terms how he was told to let the case go because it involved the CIA</v>

6296
02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:29.741
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>

6297
02:36:29.741 --> 02:36:30.820
<v Speaker 2>what are you fucking saying?</v>

6298
02:36:30.821 --> 02:36:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Are you telling me that the CIA is selling drugs in the black community?</v>

6299
02:36:35.260 --> 02:36:35.561
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

6300
02:36:35.561 --> 02:36:36.394
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

6301
02:36:36.430 --> 02:36:37.600
<v Speaker 2>let this case go.</v>

6302
02:36:38.230 --> 02:36:41.380
<v Speaker 2>This case that you busted people is actually the CIA.</v>

6303
02:36:42.060 --> 02:36:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Are you saying?</v>

6304
02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:43.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6305
02:36:43.210 --> 02:36:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6306
02:36:43.540 --> 02:36:45.550
<v Speaker 2>And that's why you have the police.</v>

6307
02:36:45.551 --> 02:36:48.880
<v Speaker 2>That's why the black community has a problem with police in this country.</v>

6308
02:36:48.970 --> 02:36:49.803
<v Speaker 2>One reason.</v>

6309
02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:50.220
<v Speaker 2>One of,</v>

6310
02:36:50.220 --> 02:36:50.341
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6311
02:36:50.341 --> 02:36:50.980
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to,</v>

6312
02:36:50.980 --> 02:36:52.690
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to believe that that's the voice of authority.</v>

6313
02:36:52.691 --> 02:36:55.930
<v Speaker 2>If you feel like the voice of authority is not honoring its own authority.</v>

6314
02:36:56.410 --> 02:36:57.250
<v Speaker 2>You know it's interesting to,</v>

6315
02:36:57.251 --> 02:37:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Bay area is also interesting because of a Oakland,</v>

6316
02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:03.100
<v Speaker 2>which the the police are notoriously horrible.</v>

6317
02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:03.993
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6318
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Like that extra horrible.</v>

6319
02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:05.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6320
02:37:05.741 --> 02:37:06.574
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

6321
02:37:07.860 --> 02:37:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean because Oakland's crazy cause it's,</v>

6322
02:37:10.230 --> 02:37:11.063
<v Speaker 2>cause the Oakland,</v>

6323
02:37:11.470 --> 02:37:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Oakland now is becoming gentrified.</v>

6324
02:37:12.911 --> 02:37:15.770
<v Speaker 2>So Oakland is not one of the cities that you find in America's top places for</v>

6325
02:37:15.771 --> 02:37:16.160
<v Speaker 2>people</v>

6326
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:17.460
<v Speaker 1>to live white paper.</v>

6327
02:37:17.730 --> 02:37:18.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's why people,</v>

6328
02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:20.150
<v Speaker 1>cause it's becoming gentrified.</v>

6329
02:37:20.151 --> 02:37:21.140
<v Speaker 1>So Oakland is really strong,</v>

6330
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:24.770
<v Speaker 1>is really struggling with the fact that it's being gentrified very quickly.</v>

6331
02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6332
02:37:25.730 --> 02:37:29.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's just communities that are not even majority black.</v>

6333
02:37:29.601 --> 02:37:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Cause as much as people think Oakland's a black city,</v>

6334
02:37:31.341 --> 02:37:32.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like 30% black.</v>

6335
02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:33.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

6336
02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:33.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6337
02:37:33.771 --> 02:37:34.281
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

6338
02:37:34.281 --> 02:37:35.480
<v Speaker 1>it's funny how few black people,</v>

6339
02:37:35.481 --> 02:37:36.320
<v Speaker 1>we have to have people go,</v>

6340
02:37:36.321 --> 02:37:37.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of black people in here,</v>

6341
02:37:37.460 --> 02:37:39.560
<v Speaker 1>30% more than the national average.</v>

6342
02:37:39.710 --> 02:37:40.540
<v Speaker 1>It is more than that,</v>

6343
02:37:40.540 --> 02:37:42.920
<v Speaker 1>but it ain't 70% what makes,</v>

6344
02:37:43.100 --> 02:37:44.210
<v Speaker 1>what's the national average?</v>

6345
02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:48.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like a 11 I think it's like somewhere around 12 or 11 one if you have 11</v>

6346
02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:49.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a black neighborhood.</v>

6347
02:37:50.630 --> 02:37:51.111
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6348
02:37:51.111 --> 02:37:52.480
<v Speaker 1>What 11% blind people.</v>

6349
02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:53.841
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6350
02:37:53.841 --> 02:37:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6351
02:37:54.210 --> 02:37:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Most neighborhoods are 100% white.</v>

6352
02:37:57.010 --> 02:37:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6353
02:37:57.550 --> 02:37:58.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's a weird,</v>

6354
02:37:58.340 --> 02:37:59.540
<v Speaker 1>and if a black family moves in,</v>

6355
02:37:59.541 --> 02:38:00.410
<v Speaker 1>it's like what's happening?</v>

6356
02:38:00.740 --> 02:38:01.573
<v Speaker 1>What's going on over there?</v>

6357
02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:02.510
<v Speaker 1>What's going on over here?</v>

6358
02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:06.220
<v Speaker 1>So let Oakland like a lot of cities that are thought of to be black cities are</v>

6359
02:38:06.221 --> 02:38:07.970
<v Speaker 1>over policed and underserved,</v>

6360
02:38:07.971 --> 02:38:08.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6361
02:38:08.271 --> 02:38:10.610
<v Speaker 1>cause people that to me it's like it's just an,</v>

6362
02:38:10.820 --> 02:38:14.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a structural institutional racism problem that the,</v>

6363
02:38:14.660 --> 02:38:15.321
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

6364
02:38:15.321 --> 02:38:17.030
<v Speaker 1>and we can talk about it or not talk about it,</v>

6365
02:38:17.031 --> 02:38:22.031
<v Speaker 1>but so that if a guy walks down the middle of the street saying like,</v>

6366
02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:25.160
<v Speaker 1>like sort of being a teenager who's allowed guy walking down the street,</v>

6367
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:27.070
<v Speaker 1>a white teenager might get told,</v>

6368
02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:28.830
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of the street and the guy who,</v>

6369
02:38:28.850 --> 02:38:31.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting a street dude grab and put them on the corner,</v>

6370
02:38:31.161 --> 02:38:32.060
<v Speaker 1>don't do this shit again.</v>

6371
02:38:32.090 --> 02:38:33.550
<v Speaker 1>But a black teenager who walks down the middle,</v>

6372
02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:34.041
<v Speaker 1>the street and goes,</v>

6373
02:38:34.041 --> 02:38:35.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting on the street ends up debt,</v>

6374
02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:40.200
<v Speaker 1>is my opinion on that situation that we get that even with that things that</v>

6375
02:38:40.201 --> 02:38:40.700
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>

6376
02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:42.140
<v Speaker 1>that would be sort of like if you're white,</v>

6377
02:38:42.141 --> 02:38:42.531
<v Speaker 1>they would be like,</v>

6378
02:38:42.531 --> 02:38:43.010
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

6379
02:38:43.010 --> 02:38:43.460
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

6380
02:38:43.460 --> 02:38:44.930
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to make a big deal out of this,</v>

6381
02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:45.860
<v Speaker 1>that when you're black,</v>

6382
02:38:45.860 --> 02:38:49.610
<v Speaker 1>it can end up in your death because of the approach to policing black people in</v>

6383
02:38:49.611 --> 02:38:50.444
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>

6384
02:38:50.660 --> 02:38:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that's a problem inherent with police officers or is it</v>

6385
02:38:56.151 --> 02:38:58.250
<v Speaker 1>because they're dealing with so much violence,</v>

6386
02:38:58.251 --> 02:38:59.750
<v Speaker 1>it's coming from black people?</v>

6387
02:38:59.990 --> 02:39:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Is it because there have been told to handle cases differently?</v>

6388
02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:05.081
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>

6389
02:39:05.081 --> 02:39:05.631
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

6390
02:39:05.631 --> 02:39:07.760
<v Speaker 1>the America was founded on racism,</v>

6391
02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:09.230
<v Speaker 1>so I think it's a,</v>

6392
02:39:09.231 --> 02:39:09.711
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

6393
02:39:09.711 --> 02:39:13.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to necessarily say cops are the problem cops,</v>

6394
02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:17.120
<v Speaker 1>the way people were black people are policing is a symptom of the fact that</v>

6395
02:39:17.121 --> 02:39:17.531
<v Speaker 1>American,</v>

6396
02:39:17.531 --> 02:39:21.650
<v Speaker 1>the cornerstone of America is racism and everything we built was on that.</v>

6397
02:39:21.950 --> 02:39:24.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's why people want to have,</v>

6398
02:39:24.220 --> 02:39:25.790
<v Speaker 1>when you won't have the reparations discussion,</v>

6399
02:39:25.791 --> 02:39:26.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

6400
02:39:26.110 --> 02:39:26.211
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6401
02:39:26.211 --> 02:39:28.550
<v Speaker 1>you know how we get a lot of cheap labor in this country,</v>

6402
02:39:28.551 --> 02:39:29.150
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

6403
02:39:29.150 --> 02:39:31.100
<v Speaker 1>how do we get to be the richest country in the world for a while?</v>

6404
02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Because we had a 40 year headstart on the labor.</v>

6405
02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:34.131
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

6406
02:39:34.131 --> 02:39:34.851
<v Speaker 1>Like we weren't paying,</v>

6407
02:39:34.851 --> 02:39:35.211
<v Speaker 1>they weren't,</v>

6408
02:39:35.211 --> 02:39:36.740
<v Speaker 1>people weren't being paid to build this country.</v>

6409
02:39:36.741 --> 02:39:37.574
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

6410
02:39:37.610 --> 02:39:38.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6411
02:39:38.090 --> 02:39:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I think that when the cornerstone of this country is founded on racism and the</v>

6412
02:39:41.721 --> 02:39:45.770
<v Speaker 1>people who police the country are trying to protect the country's reputation and</v>

6413
02:39:45.771 --> 02:39:47.450
<v Speaker 1>name that means a lot of times they,</v>

6414
02:39:47.570 --> 02:39:48.550
<v Speaker 1>they use racism.</v>

6415
02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Racism is a part of how they police the country.</v>

6416
02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:51.351
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

6417
02:39:51.351 --> 02:39:56.351
<v Speaker 1>can you ever fix a scenario where the entire culture was established with slave</v>

6418
02:39:56.841 --> 02:39:57.560
<v Speaker 1>labor?</v>

6419
02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:01.220
<v Speaker 1>If a giant percentage of what made America what it is,</v>

6420
02:40:01.250 --> 02:40:03.230
<v Speaker 1>was established because of slave labor,</v>

6421
02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:04.460
<v Speaker 1>how does that get fixed?</v>

6422
02:40:04.610 --> 02:40:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Like how does that ever balance it out?</v>

6423
02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:07.601
<v Speaker 1>How does it,</v>

6424
02:40:07.601 --> 02:40:10.890
<v Speaker 1>it does it just come naturally over a course of a long period of time?</v>

6425
02:40:10.940 --> 02:40:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Definitely doesn't come think socially engineered.</v>

6426
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:13.190
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

6427
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.940
<v Speaker 1>it has to be a,</v>

6428
02:40:13.940 --> 02:40:14.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

6429
02:40:14.350 --> 02:40:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6430
02:40:14.750 --> 02:40:15.091
<v Speaker 1>it has,</v>

6431
02:40:15.091 --> 02:40:16.710
<v Speaker 1>something has to jumpstart the process.</v>

6432
02:40:16.711 --> 02:40:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I think that the,</v>

6433
02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:18.753
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

6434
02:40:18.770 --> 02:40:21.320
<v Speaker 1>you can't say affirmative action in this country without some people go over to</v>

6435
02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:23.640
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] then a white man won't have a job.</v>

6436
02:40:23.641 --> 02:40:24.121
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

6437
02:40:24.121 --> 02:40:26.640
<v Speaker 1>but actually it's like you have to jumpstart the process.</v>

6438
02:40:26.641 --> 02:40:30.860
<v Speaker 1>You have to and maybe it's for me it's like if I literally said that I said this</v>

6439
02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:33.300
<v Speaker 1>really if every black man in this country was given therapy,</v>

6440
02:40:33.301 --> 02:40:36.480
<v Speaker 1>cause I feel like being black in America you have a mild form of PTSD or severe</v>

6441
02:40:36.481 --> 02:40:41.481
<v Speaker 1>form of Ptsd depending upon where you live and if you made it and you guarantee</v>

6442
02:40:42.151 --> 02:40:47.151
<v Speaker 1>that the schools in the inner city we're good that they were well funded public</v>

6443
02:40:47.911 --> 02:40:50.070
<v Speaker 1>schools where you could get where you could pay.</v>

6444
02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:53.730
<v Speaker 1>You may not get a good education here but this is a place where good education</v>

6445
02:40:53.731 --> 02:40:54.690
<v Speaker 1>happens easily.</v>

6446
02:40:55.080 --> 02:40:56.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's not true of most schools in the inner city.</v>

6447
02:40:57.030 --> 02:40:58.050
<v Speaker 1>And if you said,</v>

6448
02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:02.370
<v Speaker 1>and if you made it friendly for major grocery stores to be in the inner city so</v>

6449
02:41:02.371 --> 02:41:04.170
<v Speaker 1>that you know you've been in a poor neighborhood,</v>

6450
02:41:04.171 --> 02:41:05.400
<v Speaker 1>like that's the grocery store,</v>

6451
02:41:05.940 --> 02:41:08.160
<v Speaker 1>you know where it's not a major chain grocery store,</v>

6452
02:41:08.161 --> 02:41:10.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a 99 cent store that also has fruit.</v>

6453
02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:10.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

6454
02:41:10.980 --> 02:41:12.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like that you,</v>

6455
02:41:12.260 --> 02:41:15.500
<v Speaker 1>you said that if you made it so that it was friendly for those companies coming</v>

6456
02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:15.781
<v Speaker 1>to move there.</v>

6457
02:41:15.781 --> 02:41:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Cause a lot of the gentrification happens.</v>

6458
02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:19.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like people know their neighborhoods are being gentrified.</v>

6459
02:41:20.100 --> 02:41:23.100
<v Speaker 1>When the nine 9 cent close door closes down in a whole foods opens,</v>

6460
02:41:23.101 --> 02:41:23.311
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

6461
02:41:23.311 --> 02:41:24.370
<v Speaker 1>oh finally we have,</v>

6462
02:41:24.430 --> 02:41:25.560
<v Speaker 1>we can't afford to shop there.</v>

6463
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:26.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6464
02:41:26.341 --> 02:41:29.940
<v Speaker 1>so you have to change the structures of the neighborhoods.</v>

6465
02:41:30.150 --> 02:41:33.180
<v Speaker 1>You have to change the structures of how people are being,</v>

6466
02:41:33.210 --> 02:41:35.550
<v Speaker 1>how people are living their lives and there's no,</v>

6467
02:41:35.610 --> 02:41:38.430
<v Speaker 1>there's no motivation to do that.</v>

6468
02:41:39.210 --> 02:41:39.571
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6469
02:41:39.571 --> 02:41:41.100
<v Speaker 1>I think that the only,</v>

6470
02:41:41.130 --> 02:41:41.963
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

6471
02:41:41.970 --> 02:41:44.490
<v Speaker 1>the only hope that we have of that is that,</v>

6472
02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:45.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6473
02:41:45.451 --> 02:41:46.710
<v Speaker 1>there's professional sports.</v>

6474
02:41:46.711 --> 02:41:47.131
<v Speaker 1>I look at that,</v>

6475
02:41:47.131 --> 02:41:49.860
<v Speaker 1>like the money that is being made in professional sports like there at some of</v>

6476
02:41:49.861 --> 02:41:50.280
<v Speaker 1>these guys are,</v>

6477
02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:51.360
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these guys are going to go broke,</v>

6478
02:41:51.690 --> 02:41:52.710
<v Speaker 1>but in a,</v>

6479
02:41:52.711 --> 02:41:55.260
<v Speaker 1>in a hundred years we'll be dealing with the Jordan Foundation.</v>

6480
02:41:55.261 --> 02:41:56.700
<v Speaker 1>The way we're dealing with the Rockefellers,</v>

6481
02:41:56.701 --> 02:41:57.360
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

6482
02:41:57.360 --> 02:41:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Magic Johnson did a bad job.</v>

6483
02:41:59.310 --> 02:42:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Then at some point,</v>

6484
02:42:00.210 --> 02:42:04.320
<v Speaker 1>I hope that some of these people who have this like fuck you money can actually</v>

6485
02:42:04.321 --> 02:42:05.730
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to port back in,</v>

6486
02:42:05.731 --> 02:42:07.560
<v Speaker 1>but they can't necessarily like charter schools.</v>

6487
02:42:07.561 --> 02:42:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Like Jalen rose has a charter school specifically in Detroit to go,</v>

6488
02:42:11.490 --> 02:42:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I need to help jumpstart this situation myself.</v>

6489
02:42:13.771 --> 02:42:16.020
<v Speaker 1>But it's hard to rely on individuals to do that.</v>

6490
02:42:16.380 --> 02:42:16.681
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

6491
02:42:16.681 --> 02:42:17.760
<v Speaker 1>until America goes,</v>

6492
02:42:17.940 --> 02:42:22.020
<v Speaker 1>it's in our best interest to make poor neighborhoods better and easier.</v>

6493
02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:23.060
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not just on my black,</v>

6494
02:42:23.070 --> 02:42:23.731
<v Speaker 1>I just in general,</v>

6495
02:42:23.731 --> 02:42:24.690
<v Speaker 1>poor neighborhoods better.</v>

6496
02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:27.840
<v Speaker 1>It will make a better country until the government feels like that's an</v>

6497
02:42:27.841 --> 02:42:28.674
<v Speaker 1>important thing.</v>

6498
02:42:28.770 --> 02:42:29.603
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

6499
02:42:30.210 --> 02:42:30.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6500
02:42:30.721 --> 02:42:33.450
<v Speaker 1>we have this one president that Brock is pretty good and pretty liberal,</v>

6501
02:42:33.451 --> 02:42:34.800
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know what the next one's going to look like.</v>

6502
02:42:34.801 --> 02:42:37.320
<v Speaker 1>And then the next one's going to look like until the country sort of as a whole</v>

6503
02:42:37.321 --> 02:42:38.100
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

6504
02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:38.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6505
02:42:38.670 --> 02:42:40.410
<v Speaker 1>that we get to that tipping point where we need to,</v>

6506
02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:40.830
<v Speaker 1>we should,</v>

6507
02:42:40.830 --> 02:42:42.030
<v Speaker 1>all the schools should be good.</v>

6508
02:42:42.530 --> 02:42:43.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6509
02:42:43.090 --> 02:42:43.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6510
02:42:43.610 --> 02:42:44.330
<v Speaker 1>health care,</v>

6511
02:42:44.330 --> 02:42:45.210
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't bankrupt,</v>

6512
02:42:45.211 --> 02:42:45.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6513
02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:46.651
<v Speaker 1>you know you shouldn't,</v>

6514
02:42:46.651 --> 02:42:47.220
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't get,</v>

6515
02:42:47.220 --> 02:42:48.540
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't have a car accident.</v>

6516
02:42:48.570 --> 02:42:50.730
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that we have to even say these things.</v>

6517
02:42:51.110 --> 02:42:53.610
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it should be like the staples of a,</v>

6518
02:42:53.611 --> 02:42:54.510
<v Speaker 1>a culture.</v>

6519
02:42:54.540 --> 02:42:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6520
02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:55.793
<v Speaker 1>That you know,</v>

6521
02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:56.880
<v Speaker 1>in the UK they go,</v>

6522
02:42:56.881 --> 02:42:58.560
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean you went broke because you had,</v>

6523
02:42:58.561 --> 02:43:00.090
<v Speaker 1>because you've got a broken leg or something.</v>

6524
02:43:00.091 --> 02:43:04.170
<v Speaker 1>You know why I always think of in terms of what is the number one resource that</v>

6525
02:43:04.171 --> 02:43:05.010
<v Speaker 1>we have in America,</v>

6526
02:43:05.011 --> 02:43:06.220
<v Speaker 1>it's not natural resources.</v>

6527
02:43:06.221 --> 02:43:07.054
<v Speaker 1>It's human beings.</v>

6528
02:43:07.290 --> 02:43:10.860
<v Speaker 1>And wouldn't American be stronger if there were less people that were losers?</v>

6529
02:43:12.150 --> 02:43:15.610
<v Speaker 2>So what's the best way to make less people losers work with children?</v>

6530
02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

6531
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:19.750
<v Speaker 2>I think they should have community centers and in any poor neighborhoods have a</v>

6532
02:43:19.751 --> 02:43:21.130
<v Speaker 2>place where kids can escape.</v>

6533
02:43:21.310 --> 02:43:25.150
<v Speaker 2>That's really well staffed with people that are excellent counselors,</v>

6534
02:43:25.270 --> 02:43:29.770
<v Speaker 2>people that are teaching sports and martial arts and places where kids can work</v>

6535
02:43:29.771 --> 02:43:30.190
<v Speaker 2>on theirs.</v>

6536
02:43:30.190 --> 02:43:31.150
<v Speaker 2>They're studying.</v>

6537
02:43:31.151 --> 02:43:35.230
<v Speaker 2>They could have computers to use to access for books and all kinds of other shit</v>

6538
02:43:35.380 --> 02:43:38.350
<v Speaker 2>so that they can have a place that they can get in away from the crime and just</v>

6539
02:43:38.351 --> 02:43:40.480
<v Speaker 2>that alone will stop a lot of fucking crime.</v>

6540
02:43:40.690 --> 02:43:43.540
<v Speaker 2>And it'll give kids a place where they can,</v>

6541
02:43:43.660 --> 02:43:45.220
<v Speaker 2>they have a home away from home,</v>

6542
02:43:45.250 --> 02:43:46.083
<v Speaker 2>they have something.</v>

6543
02:43:46.090 --> 02:43:48.400
<v Speaker 2>So if their parents work during the day and they don't,</v>

6544
02:43:48.401 --> 02:43:50.740
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to go home and just stare at the walls.</v>

6545
02:43:50.860 --> 02:43:51.940
<v Speaker 2>They have somewhere to go to.</v>

6546
02:43:51.970 --> 02:43:54.580
<v Speaker 2>They have people that they can look up to that can help them.</v>

6547
02:43:54.581 --> 02:43:56.000
<v Speaker 2>Counselors and you're,</v>

6548
02:43:56.040 --> 02:44:00.130
<v Speaker 2>you're giving people more of a chance to be a successful human when you do that.</v>

6549
02:44:00.190 --> 02:44:01.480
<v Speaker 2>You're strengthening the country.</v>

6550
02:44:01.481 --> 02:44:01.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6551
02:44:01.661 --> 02:44:01.961
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

6552
02:44:01.961 --> 02:44:03.400
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think people see it that way.</v>

6553
02:44:03.401 --> 02:44:06.180
<v Speaker 2>They see somehow like it's again to hand out their animals,</v>

6554
02:44:06.220 --> 02:44:08.210
<v Speaker 2>their animals yourself up by your bootstraps,</v>

6555
02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:09.970
<v Speaker 2>which to me is like crazy.</v>

6556
02:44:10.090 --> 02:44:10.601
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

6557
02:44:10.601 --> 02:44:12.610
<v Speaker 2>And I think that people don't see,</v>

6558
02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:13.510
<v Speaker 2>it's so stupid.</v>

6559
02:44:13.511 --> 02:44:16.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you have an infection in your finger and you let it go,</v>

6560
02:44:16.841 --> 02:44:18.040
<v Speaker 2>it's going to kill you.</v>

6561
02:44:18.041 --> 02:44:18.581
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

6562
02:44:18.581 --> 02:44:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to sort of go,</v>

6563
02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:23.500
<v Speaker 2>we need to address this and theirs and we can either address it now or we can</v>

6564
02:44:23.501 --> 02:44:24.370
<v Speaker 2>wait until like,</v>

6565
02:44:24.371 --> 02:44:24.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6566
02:44:24.790 --> 02:44:26.260
<v Speaker 2>do we have to burn down Ferguson,</v>

6567
02:44:26.261 --> 02:44:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Missouri to get more cops to patrol?</v>

6568
02:44:29.670 --> 02:44:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6569
02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:32.610
<v Speaker 2>We might give up my place in Connecticut.</v>

6570
02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6571
02:44:33.010 --> 02:44:33.821
<v Speaker 2>We need to get that cut.</v>

6572
02:44:33.821 --> 02:44:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Our cops need tanks.</v>

6573
02:44:34.931 --> 02:44:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Arts cops definitely need tanks cause those blasts.</v>

6574
02:44:36.741 --> 02:44:37.660
<v Speaker 2>The Massey Ferguson.</v>

6575
02:44:37.661 --> 02:44:37.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6576
02:44:37.911 --> 02:44:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6577
02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Sentence drones that people don't take it.</v>

6578
02:44:40.601 --> 02:44:41.470
<v Speaker 2>They don't take it seriously.</v>

6579
02:44:41.471 --> 02:44:42.580
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's the,</v>

6580
02:44:42.581 --> 02:44:43.600
<v Speaker 2>until you people go,</v>

6581
02:44:43.630 --> 02:44:43.871
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6582
02:44:43.871 --> 02:44:44.200
<v Speaker 2>if we've,</v>

6583
02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:46.720
<v Speaker 2>if stronger communities lead to a stronger America,</v>

6584
02:44:46.990 --> 02:44:47.621
<v Speaker 2>there should be thinking,</v>

6585
02:44:47.621 --> 02:44:47.951
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

6586
02:44:47.951 --> 02:44:49.840
<v Speaker 2>there should be things that are just taken for granted and you know how they're</v>

6587
02:44:49.870 --> 02:44:50.530
<v Speaker 2>going to do that.</v>

6588
02:44:50.530 --> 02:44:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6589
02:44:50.890 --> 02:44:52.090
<v Speaker 2>taxes from marijuana.</v>

6590
02:44:52.270 --> 02:44:52.781
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

6591
02:44:52.781 --> 02:44:53.441
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

6592
02:44:53.441 --> 02:44:53.921
<v Speaker 2>That's how,</v>

6593
02:44:53.921 --> 02:44:55.150
<v Speaker 2>that's my solution.</v>

6594
02:44:55.151 --> 02:44:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentleman legalized marijuana.</v>

6595
02:44:57.100 --> 02:44:58.240
<v Speaker 2>39% tax.</v>

6596
02:44:58.241 --> 02:45:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Like Colorado is doing hundreds of millions of dollars at your disposal.</v>

6597
02:45:01.710 --> 02:45:03.410
<v Speaker 2>And I've heard the thing about the,</v>

6598
02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:04.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they figured it out,</v>

6599
02:45:04.601 --> 02:45:05.200
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

6600
02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:05.920
<v Speaker 2>because you're,</v>

6601
02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:06.670
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

6602
02:45:06.670 --> 02:45:08.980
<v Speaker 2>you can't because the federal government hasn't legalize marijuana.</v>

6603
02:45:09.010 --> 02:45:11.340
<v Speaker 2>There's all this money that the pot dispensaries are making.</v>

6604
02:45:11.340 --> 02:45:12.790
<v Speaker 2>They're slowly starting to care.</v>

6605
02:45:12.791 --> 02:45:13.624
<v Speaker 2>Put it at the bank.</v>

6606
02:45:14.350 --> 02:45:15.183
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

6607
02:45:15.430 --> 02:45:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>

6608
02:45:15.940 --> 02:45:16.181
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6609
02:45:16.181 --> 02:45:17.200
<v Speaker 2>come on America.</v>

6610
02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6611
02:45:17.950 --> 02:45:21.010
<v Speaker 2>well it's the federal government trying to fuck with people and that's what it</v>

6612
02:45:21.011 --> 02:45:21.350
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

6613
02:45:21.350 --> 02:45:21.941
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

6614
02:45:21.941 --> 02:45:23.820
<v Speaker 2>they're arresting people that are using these,</v>

6615
02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:25.120
<v Speaker 2>these federal parks,</v>

6616
02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:27.910
<v Speaker 2>like they're smoking weed in states where it's legal,</v>

6617
02:45:28.240 --> 02:45:31.450
<v Speaker 2>but they go to the park and they s they spark up a joint in a state park and</v>

6618
02:45:31.451 --> 02:45:33.280
<v Speaker 2>then the federal government comes in and the rest of them,</v>

6619
02:45:33.310 --> 02:45:36.250
<v Speaker 2>even though Barack Obama I think has been pretty clear about,</v>

6620
02:45:36.251 --> 02:45:39.030
<v Speaker 2>they're not trying to prosecute the president of the United States is,</v>

6621
02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:40.450
<v Speaker 2>is we're not trying to go after these things.</v>

6622
02:45:40.451 --> 02:45:41.201
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6623
02:45:41.201 --> 02:45:42.970
<v Speaker 2>he has been pretty clear about that.</v>

6624
02:45:42.971 --> 02:45:43.691
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

6625
02:45:43.691 --> 02:45:48.691
<v Speaker 2>his administration and the DEA has prosecuted a lot of fucking people in states</v>

6626
02:45:50.051 --> 02:45:51.580
<v Speaker 2>where medical marijuana is legal.</v>

6627
02:45:52.340 --> 02:45:53.650
<v Speaker 2>The other thing they do,</v>

6628
02:45:53.651 --> 02:45:54.484
<v Speaker 2>which is really cute,</v>

6629
02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:55.750
<v Speaker 2>is they arrest people.</v>

6630
02:45:55.780 --> 02:45:56.710
<v Speaker 2>They take all their weed,</v>

6631
02:45:56.711 --> 02:45:59.860
<v Speaker 2>they take all their money and then they say the case is pending and they just</v>

6632
02:45:59.861 --> 02:46:02.140
<v Speaker 2>have to sit there and they don't do anything about it.</v>

6633
02:46:02.141 --> 02:46:05.980
<v Speaker 2>But they stole $500,000 from them in $1 million worth of weed.</v>

6634
02:46:06.130 --> 02:46:08.350
<v Speaker 2>And then just sit in there waiting to find out whether or not you're going to go</v>

6635
02:46:08.351 --> 02:46:09.184
<v Speaker 2>to jail.</v>

6636
02:46:09.350 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 2>And some of them</v>

6637
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:10.430
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

6638
02:46:10.430 --> 02:46:12.650
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who's gone to jail because of it.</v>

6639
02:46:12.690 --> 02:46:17.300
<v Speaker 1>I know several people that have gone to jail during the Obama Administration for</v>

6640
02:46:17.301 --> 02:46:18.920
<v Speaker 1>selling medical marijuana that's legal.</v>

6641
02:46:18.921 --> 02:46:21.170
<v Speaker 1>So he's kind of full of shit when it comes to that.</v>

6642
02:46:21.171 --> 02:46:21.530
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

6643
02:46:21.530 --> 02:46:21.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

6644
02:46:21.861 --> 02:46:22.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6645
02:46:22.101 --> 02:46:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

6646
02:46:22.290 --> 02:46:23.300
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

6647
02:46:23.301 --> 02:46:24.090
<v Speaker 1>I like Brock.</v>

6648
02:46:24.090 --> 02:46:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in love with him anymore,</v>

6649
02:46:25.590 --> 02:46:26.271
<v Speaker 1>but it happened.</v>

6650
02:46:26.271 --> 02:46:27.104
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys break up?</v>

6651
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.943
<v Speaker 1>We broke.</v>

6652
02:46:28.220 --> 02:46:29.053
<v Speaker 1>What caused it?</v>

6653
02:46:29.450 --> 02:46:30.283
<v Speaker 1>What caused it?</v>

6654
02:46:30.570 --> 02:46:31.041
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

6655
02:46:31.041 --> 02:46:33.470
<v Speaker 1>the thing that actually caused it over and over again was every time there was</v>

6656
02:46:33.471 --> 02:46:34.160
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

6657
02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:34.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6658
02:46:34.700 --> 02:46:35.720
<v Speaker 1>like Troy Davis,</v>

6659
02:46:35.721 --> 02:46:37.310
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was on death row in Texas,</v>

6660
02:46:37.311 --> 02:46:38.061
<v Speaker 1>who people were like,</v>

6661
02:46:38.061 --> 02:46:39.620
<v Speaker 1>the evidence says that he didn't do it.</v>

6662
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:40.580
<v Speaker 1>And there are people,</v>

6663
02:46:40.580 --> 02:46:42.230
<v Speaker 1>like I remember on Twitter people like say something,</v>

6664
02:46:42.231 --> 02:46:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Brock say something.</v>

6665
02:46:43.311 --> 02:46:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Just if people were like,</v>

6666
02:46:44.211 --> 02:46:45.200
<v Speaker 1>well it's not his jurisdiction.</v>

6667
02:46:45.201 --> 02:46:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Every time there's an issue that is that fall squarely on the head of black</v>

6668
02:46:48.891 --> 02:46:51.560
<v Speaker 1>people in this country and Barack sort of tippy toes around her,</v>

6669
02:46:51.561 --> 02:46:53.090
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't address it head on soon enough.</v>

6670
02:46:53.330 --> 02:46:54.230
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he,</v>

6671
02:46:54.410 --> 02:46:56.750
<v Speaker 1>that's why we elected a black president.</v>

6672
02:46:56.780 --> 02:46:58.310
<v Speaker 1>That's why black people went out to vote.</v>

6673
02:46:58.311 --> 02:47:02.300
<v Speaker 1>It's because we wanted somebody who had our back and every time he doesn't and</v>

6674
02:47:02.301 --> 02:47:02.750
<v Speaker 1>he can't,</v>

6675
02:47:02.750 --> 02:47:03.820
<v Speaker 1>he can't fix problems.</v>

6676
02:47:03.821 --> 02:47:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't expect them to fix things.</v>

6677
02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:08.330
<v Speaker 1>But when it takes them four days to talk about Ferguson and as he says,</v>

6678
02:47:08.510 --> 02:47:10.310
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want to say anything too quickly or do you want to say,</v>

6679
02:47:10.311 --> 02:47:12.650
<v Speaker 1>cause he didn't want to be seen as putting his thumb on the scale of justice.</v>

6680
02:47:12.651 --> 02:47:12.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

6681
02:47:12.950 --> 02:47:13.401
<v Speaker 1>Oh dude,</v>

6682
02:47:13.401 --> 02:47:14.420
<v Speaker 1>that's why I elected you.</v>

6683
02:47:14.980 --> 02:47:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I wanted your thumb on the scale of justice.</v>

6684
02:47:17.330 --> 02:47:18.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's because that's what we,</v>

6685
02:47:18.171 --> 02:47:18.531
<v Speaker 1>it's again,</v>

6686
02:47:18.531 --> 02:47:19.670
<v Speaker 1>we need to jumpstart the system.</v>

6687
02:47:19.671 --> 02:47:20.510
<v Speaker 1>And so for me,</v>

6688
02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:22.490
<v Speaker 1>the stuff like that with uh,</v>

6689
02:47:22.940 --> 02:47:23.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6690
02:47:23.241 --> 02:47:24.074
<v Speaker 1>with the sort of the,</v>

6691
02:47:24.110 --> 02:47:24.830
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

6692
02:47:24.830 --> 02:47:25.161
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

6693
02:47:25.161 --> 02:47:26.480
<v Speaker 1>if he talks about Trayvon Martin,</v>

6694
02:47:26.570 --> 02:47:27.640
<v Speaker 1>people go even,</v>

6695
02:47:27.970 --> 02:47:28.270
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

6696
02:47:28.270 --> 02:47:28.701
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going,</v>

6697
02:47:28.701 --> 02:47:28.851
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6698
02:47:28.851 --> 02:47:29.750
<v Speaker 1>well that's the job.</v>

6699
02:47:30.290 --> 02:47:31.280
<v Speaker 1>The job is to get yelled at.</v>

6700
02:47:31.281 --> 02:47:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the job is to take a hat is to have a hard week because you take a</v>

6701
02:47:34.251 --> 02:47:34.790
<v Speaker 1>good stance.</v>

6702
02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:36.530
<v Speaker 1>If you take a stance anyway,</v>

6703
02:47:36.531 --> 02:47:37.251
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get yelled at.</v>

6704
02:47:37.251 --> 02:47:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6705
02:47:37.540 --> 02:47:38.990
<v Speaker 1>So I don't pro or con,</v>

6706
02:47:39.290 --> 02:47:43.410
<v Speaker 1>if he took an Andrew Zimmerman stance that George would have the fuck his name</v>

6707
02:47:43.411 --> 02:47:44.060
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

6708
02:47:44.060 --> 02:47:45.650
<v Speaker 1>or he took a Trayvon Martin stance,</v>

6709
02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:46.740
<v Speaker 1>w whoevers side,</v>

6710
02:47:46.741 --> 02:47:47.541
<v Speaker 1>he cited on,</v>

6711
02:47:47.541 --> 02:47:49.940
<v Speaker 1>you're going to face an assault of opinion.</v>

6712
02:47:49.941 --> 02:47:53.930
<v Speaker 1>But my contention is that black people rallied around a black president because</v>

6713
02:47:53.931 --> 02:47:54.201
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

6714
02:47:54.201 --> 02:47:55.034
<v Speaker 1>we meet,</v>

6715
02:47:55.250 --> 02:47:55.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6716
02:47:55.551 --> 02:47:55.971
<v Speaker 1>born again.</v>

6717
02:47:55.971 --> 02:47:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Christians had a voice in the,</v>

6718
02:47:57.111 --> 02:47:58.610
<v Speaker 1>in the White House with George W.</v>

6719
02:47:58.610 --> 02:48:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Bush and George Bush did not hide his boarding and Christian this,</v>

6720
02:48:00.890 --> 02:48:01.430
<v Speaker 1>he didn't,</v>

6721
02:48:01.430 --> 02:48:01.761
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

6722
02:48:01.761 --> 02:48:02.660
<v Speaker 1>God all the time.</v>

6723
02:48:02.661 --> 02:48:03.301
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

6724
02:48:03.301 --> 02:48:04.610
<v Speaker 1>where it God's because you know that stuff.</v>

6725
02:48:04.910 --> 02:48:05.743
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Brock,</v>

6726
02:48:06.590 --> 02:48:07.131
<v Speaker 1>he know he,</v>

6727
02:48:07.131 --> 02:48:07.521
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

6728
02:48:07.521 --> 02:48:10.220
<v Speaker 1>he's clearly walking a fine line,</v>

6729
02:48:10.221 --> 02:48:10.880
<v Speaker 1>which I get it.</v>

6730
02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to trade places with them.</v>

6731
02:48:12.201 --> 02:48:13.190
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to be the first black,</v>

6732
02:48:13.500 --> 02:48:14.900
<v Speaker 1>that fifth black president,</v>

6733
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:16.640
<v Speaker 1>any president or any president,</v>

6734
02:48:16.641 --> 02:48:17.361
<v Speaker 1>white president.</v>

6735
02:48:17.361 --> 02:48:18.680
<v Speaker 1>You did take the job.</v>

6736
02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:20.200
<v Speaker 1>You did go get it.</v>

6737
02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:20.661
<v Speaker 1>You didn't,</v>

6738
02:48:20.661 --> 02:48:21.950
<v Speaker 1>you didn't get assigned the job.</v>

6739
02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that that job's unimaginably difficult and unmanageable?</v>

6740
02:48:25.491 --> 02:48:26.300
<v Speaker 1>He difficult.</v>

6741
02:48:26.300 --> 02:48:26.631
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

6742
02:48:26.631 --> 02:48:27.470
<v Speaker 1>but you took the job.</v>

6743
02:48:27.740 --> 02:48:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

6744
02:48:28.150 --> 02:48:28.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

6745
02:48:28.701 --> 02:48:29.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6746
02:48:29.250 --> 02:48:29.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6747
02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:29.721
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6748
02:48:29.721 --> 02:48:30.081
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

6749
02:48:30.081 --> 02:48:30.914
<v Speaker 1>but just uh,</v>

6750
02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:31.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6751
02:48:32.030 --> 02:48:32.863
<v Speaker 1>everything is,</v>

6752
02:48:32.870 --> 02:48:34.940
<v Speaker 1>we all have our things we pick and it's hard to do.</v>

6753
02:48:34.941 --> 02:48:36.110
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to be a standup comedian,</v>

6754
02:48:36.111 --> 02:48:36.800
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

6755
02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:37.760
<v Speaker 1>we took the job,</v>

6756
02:48:37.780 --> 02:48:38.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6757
02:48:38.180 --> 02:48:38.631
<v Speaker 1>not saying it's,</v>

6758
02:48:38.631 --> 02:48:39.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not comparing it to being a president,</v>

6759
02:48:39.930 --> 02:48:40.880
<v Speaker 1>a stand up comedian.</v>

6760
02:48:40.890 --> 02:48:42.050
<v Speaker 1>You can actually do it.</v>

6761
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:43.510
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

6762
02:48:43.510 --> 02:48:44.240
<v Speaker 1>you're getting the,</v>

6763
02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:44.721
<v Speaker 1>the White House.</v>

6764
02:48:44.721 --> 02:48:45.740
<v Speaker 1>You can't actually be the president,</v>

6765
02:48:45.741 --> 02:48:45.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6766
02:48:45.861 --> 02:48:46.611
<v Speaker 1>I cannot really,</v>

6767
02:48:46.611 --> 02:48:48.290
<v Speaker 1>the presidents get in there,</v>

6768
02:48:48.291 --> 02:48:48.590
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6769
02:48:48.590 --> 02:48:53.330
<v Speaker 1>You are faced with just a fucking tidal wave of special interest groups and</v>

6770
02:48:53.331 --> 02:48:55.740
<v Speaker 1>money and pull and push.</v>

6771
02:48:55.790 --> 02:48:56.623
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

6772
02:48:56.930 --> 02:48:58.760
<v Speaker 1>It's probably similar to having your own late night talk show.</v>

6773
02:48:58.761 --> 02:48:59.001
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

6774
02:48:59.001 --> 02:49:00.140
<v Speaker 1>this is how it's done.</v>

6775
02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:01.850
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do a cold opening.</v>

6776
02:49:01.851 --> 02:49:03.350
<v Speaker 1>But I don't want to do a cold opening,</v>

6777
02:49:03.351 --> 02:49:06.290
<v Speaker 1>except you never get to that Jon Stewart position where you'd tell everybody to</v>

6778
02:49:06.291 --> 02:49:06.900
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

6779
02:49:06.900 --> 02:49:07.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6780
02:49:07.100 --> 02:49:10.090
<v Speaker 1>because you don't get to be president for 20 years too,</v>

6781
02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:12.690
<v Speaker 1>but you'll be in the show is not the country.</v>

6782
02:49:12.691 --> 02:49:12.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6783
02:49:12.901 --> 02:49:13.081
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6784
02:49:13.081 --> 02:49:13.914
<v Speaker 1>it's not the country,</v>

6785
02:49:14.460 --> 02:49:14.761
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

6786
02:49:14.761 --> 02:49:15.510
<v Speaker 1>We're out of time.</v>

6787
02:49:15.510 --> 02:49:15.900
<v Speaker 1>We did.</v>

6788
02:49:15.900 --> 02:49:16.890
<v Speaker 1>We just did three hours.</v>

6789
02:49:17.100 --> 02:49:18.840
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was coming in here for the long haul,</v>

6790
02:49:18.841 --> 02:49:22.010
<v Speaker 1>but through and through I was a trying to keep the ball.</v>

6791
02:49:22.110 --> 02:49:22.943
<v Speaker 1>That was fun.</v>

6792
02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:24.330
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing next?</v>

6793
02:49:24.331 --> 02:49:24.811
<v Speaker 1>Is there any,</v>

6794
02:49:24.811 --> 02:49:27.420
<v Speaker 1>if you have any projects in the world could look forward to?</v>

6795
02:49:27.420 --> 02:49:27.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6796
02:49:27.751 --> 02:49:29.160
<v Speaker 1>I do have a big project in the world.</v>

6797
02:49:29.161 --> 02:49:29.521
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

6798
02:49:29.521 --> 02:49:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking a month off because my wife's going to have our second kid.</v>

6799
02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6800
02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:33.630
<v Speaker 1>but people can't look forward to that.</v>

6801
02:49:33.660 --> 02:49:34.590
<v Speaker 1>But then in November,</v>

6802
02:49:34.591 --> 02:49:36.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going out him like my most extensive tour ever.</v>

6803
02:49:37.030 --> 02:49:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6804
