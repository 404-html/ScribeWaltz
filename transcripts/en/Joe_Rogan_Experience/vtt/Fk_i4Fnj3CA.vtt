3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.250
<v Speaker 1>like they've got the standard issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmful to yourself or others,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like committed for the involuntary</v>

5
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:17.190
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric hold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they've got the,</v>

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>the something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extraordinarily,</v>

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extraordinarily qualifying</v>

<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:28.780
<v Speaker 1>and the something else wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

11
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>so they had me on the something else</v>
<v Speaker 1>swing and like,</v>

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And like my roommate was like fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hiding in the closet from like in</v>

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>demons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude,</v>

15
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

16
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I've been hearing voices for like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years,</v>

17
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.540
<v Speaker 1>but nothing like this guy voices say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>do you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're the best,</v>

19
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.173
<v Speaker 1>your cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your</v>

20
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>angels and demons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>like some of them would tell me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're worthless.</v>

22
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>He needed to die and I would be like</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to suffocate myself to death,</v>

23
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.690
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not like with anything,</v>

25
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm just holding my breath.</v>

26
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>That was the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>but that was the whole thing was I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing voices because I was hopping so</v>

28
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>much nitrous oxide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while,</v>

29
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're doing ketamine,</v>

30
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>while I was doing cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never smoked this joint.</v>

31
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:32.451
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make me feel so much better about</v>

32
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:40.101
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to watch it watch intervention so</v>

33
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>that I could feel better about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about your health more than</v>

34
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:48.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about like you overdosing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried your overall,</v>

35
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a slow deterioration of your fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the stuff that keeps you together,</v>

36
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine now.</v>

37
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I just worked out for</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to Steve.</v>

38
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I may have been when they said a sign</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in something else.</v>

39
00:02:10.271 --> 00:02:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Award like people are not people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Guy,</v>

40
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I remember one guy like shit on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking ground and was breakdancing and</v>

41
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.150
<v Speaker 1>it like tried to like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it sounds like I'm making it up.</v>

42
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>I swear I'm not dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in,</v>

43
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.670
<v Speaker 1>his goal was to like smear it around</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as he could.</v>

44
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>And this is in the room with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:34.280
<v Speaker 1>that was in the hallway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was another dude.</v>

46
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>It's break dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to his own Shimmy.</v>

47
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 1>It looked like his break dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was like,</v>

48
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>he took a shit and he's trying to smear</v>
<v Speaker 1>it around as much as he could and it</v>

49
00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:46.060
<v Speaker 1>just looked like it was break dancing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

50
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking earlier about like how</v>

51
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:54.831
<v Speaker 1>we repress all this really natural stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make it a problem when it doesn't</v>

53
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:57.920
<v Speaker 1>need to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered why that is and I</v>

54
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>wonder if it has anything to do</v>

55
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.160
<v Speaker 2>with our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our need for innovation and for growth</v>

56
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.270
<v Speaker 2>and for productivity and if the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like somehow in suppressing sexuality</v>

57
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 2>makes people concentrate on being more</v>
<v Speaker 2>productive and more successful so that</v>

58
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:24.781
<v Speaker 2>way you can kind of earn sex and if sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>was more free you wouldn't get as much</v>

59
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wonder if it's some sort of a</v>

60
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:32.311
<v Speaker 2>weird work around that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost like I'm the construction of this</v>

61
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.540
<v Speaker 2>advanced civilization as sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's,</v>

62
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 2>it's invented this path that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ensures productivity.</v>

63
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 2>And one of the best ways to do that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make people compete like in a very,</v>

64
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 2>very efficient and very ferocious way</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the attention of women.</v>

65
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 2>And if this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the attention of women was easily</v>

66
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 2>achieved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be less ambition and there</v>

67
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:57.310
<v Speaker 2>would be less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a sense,</v>

68
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.610
<v Speaker 2>suppression like leads to more</v>
<v Speaker 2>materialism that leads to a more obvious</v>

69
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 2>expression of materialism.</v>

70
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 2>Like you want the big house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want the Nice Watch,</v>

71
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 2>you want the nice shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice clothes and in wanting all those</v>

72
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to list things because sex is</v>

73
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 2>like difficult to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if sex was easy to achieve,</v>

74
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 2>you'd be a little bit more relaxed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>your needs because like ultimately the</v>

75
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 2>physical needs kind of like trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the other stuff,</v>

76
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do you want,</v>

77
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 2>do you want a nice watch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

78
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do I want.</v>

79
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 2>And I swatched it will look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kind of look cool.</v>

80
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you want a nice watch?</v>

81
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 2>Because girls are gonna recognize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Well girls don't give a shit about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice watch.</v>

83
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 2>They just want to suck your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

84
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:40.264
<v Speaker 2>Well fuck that.</v>

85
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Well you've just summarized the argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Freud's civilization and its</v>

86
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:48.870
<v Speaker 1>discontents reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

87
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.120
<v Speaker 1>that's what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

88
00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:55.121
<v Speaker 1>civilization is the product of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>repressed sexual energy being redirected</v>

89
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.420
<v Speaker 1>into productive activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

90
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've sort of reversed it.</v>

91
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I've reversed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost like civilization is so weird.</v>

92
00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

93
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Because because it's the result of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wants to continue and amplify that</v>

94
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.490
<v Speaker 1>like any system wants to persist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because it's the result of that than</v>

95
00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:23.391
<v Speaker 1>there are in built in mechanisms for</v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetuating that cycle of repression.</v>

96
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Redirection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.380
<v Speaker 1>dangling the carrot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>

98
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.660
<v Speaker 1>if capitalism could stop us from</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing and then charge us for air,</v>

99
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>they would.</v>

100
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 2>And you made this one tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>

101
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fairly innocuous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually know completely innocuous.</v>

102
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Totally justified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first tweet the company you were</v>

103
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 2>working for makes in response to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call you,</v>

104
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:52.820
<v Speaker 2>they're former community leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that how you found out you were.</v>

105
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 2>You were</v>

106
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>fired practically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can run you through the timetable</v>

107
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.271
<v Speaker 1>list if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

108
00:05:57.271 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>so at the beginning</v>

109
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 3>of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what company was it again?</v>

110
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.381
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

111
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:02.600

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of really talented artists who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are making it an incredibly ambitious</v>

113
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:08.790
<v Speaker 3>game called evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

114
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 3>and so the game was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the game is and was and still is really</v>

115
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

116
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

119
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 3>than most of corporate America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We work,</v>

120
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 3>we go in at like 10:00 AM and we leave</v>
<v Speaker 3>at like 7:00 PM because we're usually up</v>

121
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 3>until really late evening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>late in the evening.</v>

122
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 3>So I really don't even wake up until</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 9:00 everyday most days.</v>

123
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 3>So that day I woke up and my phone was</v>
<v Speaker 3>buzzing and blowing up.</v>

124
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my,</v>

125
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.080
<v Speaker 3>one of my really close friends and</v>
<v Speaker 3>colleagues at the time texted me and he</v>

126
00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:36.411
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

127
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that stuff you tweeted about</v>

128
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 3>the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some news outlet picked up on it,</v>

129
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:46.901
<v Speaker 3>some small thing and ultra group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly what we wanted to capitalize on</v>

130
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:48.031
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that,</v>

131
00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 3>that sensational headline.</v>

132
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 3>And so he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just giving me a heads up and I</v>

133
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:51.591
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

134
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no thanks whatever.</v>

135
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 3>To me at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time I was like,</v>

136
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.340
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I know what the group he did,</v>

137
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to name the site but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know what they're about.</v>

138
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.880
<v Speaker 3>They do this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

139
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:02.970
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

140
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 3>and then so maybe I jumped in the shower</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I get out and I've got texts from</v>

141
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:09.320
<v Speaker 3>like our gm at our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at our studio,</v>

142
00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to go radio dark on all social</v>

143
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:12.870
<v Speaker 3>media period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

144
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.971
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

145
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I texted him back and I'm like,</v>

146
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 3>is this in relation to the article?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one article that no one else picked</v>

147
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:22.080
<v Speaker 3>up on and that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

148
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half the comments were like that dude,</v>

149
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 3>that's totally not what Josh was saying.</v>

150
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.920
<v Speaker 3>And the other half were kind of reacting</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensationally to it.</v>

151
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
<v Speaker 3>But like the other half you've been on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the common to the Oracle,</v>

152
00:07:30.161 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're taking them out of context.</v>

153
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.170
<v Speaker 3>And that was the entire extent of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>controversy circling me at the time.</v>

154
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then 45 minutes later I still have</v>

155
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 3>even left my apartment to go into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>studio yet 45 minutes later my email</v>

156
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:44.000
<v Speaker 3>stops working and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

157
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.961
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not dumb,</v>

158
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

159
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.920
<v Speaker 3>they literally just shut off my email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

160
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.130
<v Speaker 3>and then so I tried calling him and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't take my call and then an hour</v>

161
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 3>later he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

162
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:54.310
<v Speaker 3>we should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should probably meet at like the</v>

163
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.030
<v Speaker 3>starbucks around the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

164
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't even want me to come into</v>

165
00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 3>the office and talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't want to hear my side of</v>

166
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:03.860
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to see what's,</v>

167
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:05.630
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's just done.</v>

168
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 3>And then they issued the statement that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they made which was like the literally</v>

169
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:12.260
<v Speaker 3>putting the match to the kerosene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe there was some kerosene,</v>

170
00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 3>maybe there was some potential for</v>
<v Speaker 3>outrage.</v>

171
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.920
<v Speaker 3>And then when they fired me it turned</v>
<v Speaker 3>into this huge thing in the gaming</v>

172
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Speaker 3>industry around like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that right?</v>

173
00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:22.590
<v Speaker 3>Was that wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like the,</v>

174
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of people who had</v>
<v Speaker 3>never even heard about that or even</v>

175
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:29.450
<v Speaker 3>would've cared that I tweeted that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of like everybody heard about</v>

176
00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

177
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.310
<v Speaker 3>mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heard about it.</v>

178
00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Like Mark Cuban started following me on</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>

179
00:08:33.021 --> 00:08:35.180
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they were afraid the NBA was going to</v>

180
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.400
<v Speaker 3>get pissed at us for me for weighing in</v>
<v Speaker 3>on it,</v>

181
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of reaction to it made it</v>

182
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:41.810
<v Speaker 3>like 50 times worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

183
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:42.770
<v Speaker 3>I wish I was.</v>
