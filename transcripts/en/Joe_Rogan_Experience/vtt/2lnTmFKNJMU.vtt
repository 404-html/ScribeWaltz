<v Speaker 1>this is live.</v>

9
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm nervous now,</v>

10
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>whenever we're live in your heart skips a beat thinking it's people listening to</v>

11
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:17.964
<v Speaker 1>this shit.</v>

12
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.880
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>By now.</v>

15
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>If you tune into this podcast,</v>

16
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know about it,</v>

17
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a flashlight,</v>

18
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>but you can fuck it.</v>

21
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:30.780
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

22
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>it's great they should incorporate it with a flashlight because nobody ever</v>

23
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 1>knows where the flashlight is,</v>

24
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>but everybody knows where their fleshlight is and he's so right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's so true.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's taken a lot of pussy in your body.</v>

91
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.233
<v Speaker 1>How you doing that?</v>

92
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.941
<v Speaker 1>Really Long.</v>

93
00:02:12.941 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Something creepy about singing,</v>

94
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.440
<v Speaker 1>eating pussy like age.</v>

95
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of chewing and swallowing.</v>

96
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>It's something you know a girl can suck a cock and that's totally right.</v>

97
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>When you're eating pussy it's like,</v>

98
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>it just sounds like you're chewing,</v>

99
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's like a fat guy and you think of him like being hungry and</v>

100
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>he's eating pussy and he's just like,</v>

101
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>you think he's just going to take a bite out of it.</v>

102
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if like if he really ate pussy,</v>

103
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:36.570
<v Speaker 1>if it was like the most delicious piece of</v>

104
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 1>bolts,</v>

105
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>probably print a tender season.</v>

106
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to make sure you didn't cook it very fast.</v>

107
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>He like salt and vinegar.</v>

108
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Potato chips.</v>

109
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.380
<v Speaker 1>You would have to be like a searing,</v>

110
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.650
<v Speaker 1>just black and blue it.</v>

111
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

112
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I found out about blue sticks this weekend in Atlanta for the first time.</v>

113
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>How do you order at a restaurant?</v>

114
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

115
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Speaker 1>there was rare and then it said blue and I was like,</v>

116
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is blue?</v>

117
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 1>So this is the coolest shit ever.</v>

118
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I tweet Anthony Bordain and Anthony Bordain tweets me the answer.</v>

119
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:04.534
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

120
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

121
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

122
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>how great is this world that we live in?</v>

123
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

124
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.850
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

125
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>What was the steak place?</v>

126
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>So it was twice in the four seasons in Atlanta.</v>

127
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.661
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the name.</v>

128
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I know it or no,</v>

129
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

130
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>is it chop?</v>

131
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.343
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

132
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.451
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

133
00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>But he's really good.</v>

134
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.811
<v Speaker 1>He's placed in Atlanta.</v>

135
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be a member to get in.</v>

136
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

137
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.010

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>And it's got like at the restaurant,</v>

139
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>but then there's a member's room.</v>

140
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the best steak I've ever had my whole life.</v>

141
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

142
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>this is the end of the commercial.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That must stay in,</v>

180
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.290
<v Speaker 1>but Nick Diaz just nailed it.</v>

181
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Train by day.</v>

182
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

183
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I always wondered who that was.</v>

184
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Nick motherfucking is</v>

185
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.080
<v Speaker 1>my favorite fighter to ever test positive for weed,</v>

186
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.703
<v Speaker 1>but a good guy</v>

187
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>fucking so stupid.</v>

188
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.821
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

189
00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:54.710
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even really test positive for wheat.</v>

190
00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.890
<v Speaker 1>He tested positive for an inactive metabolite.</v>

191
00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not a psychoactive,</v>

192
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.410
<v Speaker 1>it's evidence that some cannabis has been in this system,</v>

193
00:05:03.411 --> 00:05:05.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's not evidence of marijuana.</v>

194
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.030
<v Speaker 1>It's evidence of an inactive metabolite.</v>

195
00:05:08.031 --> 00:05:08.864
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

196
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.470
<v Speaker 1>So it does.</v>

197
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.930
<v Speaker 1>You could have taken this inactive metabolite,</v>

198
00:05:11.931 --> 00:05:15.860
<v Speaker 1>which isn't even prevented or a prohibited by the Nevada State Athletic</v>

199
00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Commission.</v>

200
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.810
<v Speaker 1>So why so it didn't matter.</v>

201
00:05:17.811 --> 00:05:18.411
<v Speaker 1>It's also be,</v>

202
00:05:18.411 --> 00:05:20.660
<v Speaker 1>besides the possibility of taking it that way,</v>

203
00:05:20.661 --> 00:05:21.950
<v Speaker 1>you can also get some,</v>

204
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.380
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

205
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.551
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

206
00:05:22.551 --> 00:05:22.631
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

207
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:22.760
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

208
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.990
<v Speaker 1>You can get it from marijuana.</v>

209
00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:25.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not a masking issue.</v>

210
00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:26.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a flushing issue.</v>

211
00:05:26.901 --> 00:05:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can mask marijuana approved.</v>

212
00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:29.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

213
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I know you're out there.</v>

214
00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:31.430
<v Speaker 1>There's something that can tell me,</v>

215
00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:32.660
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying why would that,</v>

216
00:05:32.661 --> 00:05:34.610
<v Speaker 1>that's not a performance enhancing drug.</v>

217
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.911
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

218
00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a PR somehow or another.</v>

219
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.461
<v Speaker 1>What they're saying.</v>

220
00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I believe if I understand the legal language,</v>

221
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I think what they're saying is that the metabolites shows that he has had it in</v>

222
00:05:44.991 --> 00:05:45.824
<v Speaker 1>his system.</v>

223
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.060
<v Speaker 1>But what's really crazy is it's so stupid because they know he's a patient.</v>

224
00:05:50.061 --> 00:05:52.640
<v Speaker 1>He's a medical marijuana patient in California,</v>

225
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.190
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't know that Nick Diaz smokes weed,</v>

226
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

227
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>are you paying attention at</v>

228
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 2>all?</v>

229
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 2>You don't know he smokes weed.</v>

230
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>

231
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 2>It's okay if he stops 13 days,</v>

232
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 2>but not 1211 days,</v>

233
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 2>but not ten nine days,</v>

234
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:07.391
<v Speaker 2>but not age.</v>

235
00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Shut the fuck up.</v>

236
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking stupid.</v>

237
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

238
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Because what you're talking about is not him being high inside the octagon.</v>

239
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 2>The psychoactive effects of marijuana don't exist when he's in that octagon</v>

240
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

241
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.671
<v Speaker 2>with those levels,</v>

242
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible.</v>

243
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 2>So he's 100% sober.</v>

244
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 2>That should be the question.</v>

245
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 2>You know he was taking it before that because he's got a card.</v>

246
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 2>So when is it?</v>

247
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Where's this logical cutoffs?</v>

248
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.060
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

249
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.530
<v Speaker 3>Like the HGH thing,</v>

250
00:06:32.531 --> 00:06:34.690
<v Speaker 3>you know the NFL is trying to good luck.</v>

251
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

252
00:06:34.891 --> 00:06:35.910
<v Speaker 3>it's so fucking crazy.</v>

253
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.850
<v Speaker 3>I've been reading so much about it because I do a podcast called Wad cast about</v>

254
00:06:39.851 --> 00:06:40.620
<v Speaker 3>crossfit.</v>

255
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh Dude.</v>

256
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

257
00:06:41.261 --> 00:06:44.910
<v Speaker 3>And across the place just opened up like 10 miles away from their opening</v>

258
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.960
<v Speaker 3>fucking bathrooms at Starbucks.</v>

259
00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:48.040
<v Speaker 3>They're everywhere.</v>

260
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.240
<v Speaker 3>But they,</v>

261
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.230
<v Speaker 3>their tests,</v>

262
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.550
<v Speaker 3>they say they tested the games and like 68,000 people tried out for the games</v>

263
00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 3>this year.</v>

264
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.540
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

265
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.373
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

266
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:57.251
<v Speaker 3>these guys,</v>

267
00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:59.560
<v Speaker 3>like if you look at the guys that are the top crossfitters,</v>

268
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.780
<v Speaker 3>some people say they don't use,</v>

269
00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:03.070
<v Speaker 3>some people say they could.</v>

270
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm not here to say if they do or don't,</v>

271
00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:08.770
<v Speaker 3>but they're doing like four and five workouts a day.</v>

272
00:07:08.771 --> 00:07:09.910
<v Speaker 3>They're just insane.</v>

273
00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:10.061
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

274
00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:10.261
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

275
00:07:10.261 --> 00:07:10.481
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

276
00:07:10.481 --> 00:07:12.370
<v Speaker 3>they're inhuman and,</v>

277
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.750
<v Speaker 3>and just the recovery rate I'm looking at going fucking HGH would be amazing.</v>

278
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.100
<v Speaker 3>But when they test,</v>

279
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.720
<v Speaker 3>they test the same way the NFL does,</v>

280
00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:20.650
<v Speaker 3>which you can't,</v>

281
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.510
<v Speaker 3>you can't catch it in the urine test.</v>

282
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.400
<v Speaker 3>Only like one time in the world.</v>

283
00:07:24.401 --> 00:07:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Has anyone gotten caught in an HGH?</v>

284
00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:27.131
<v Speaker 3>You're in test.</v>

285
00:07:27.131 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 3>It was like a rugby player in the UK.</v>

286
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

287
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.950
<v Speaker 3>at one time.</v>

288
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:30.820
<v Speaker 3>One time in a year.</v>

289
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:32.520
<v Speaker 3>And totally crazy levels or something.</v>

290
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

291
00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:35.520
<v Speaker 3>Something was wrong was just completely white.</v>

292
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.530
<v Speaker 3>So they have this new system that they think they're going to be able to test.</v>

293
00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:41.800
<v Speaker 3>But we had Sean Waxman who is the Olympic weightlifting code.</v>

294
00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:43.690
<v Speaker 3>He's got Waxman's Jim down by the airport.</v>

295
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.290
<v Speaker 3>We had him on the other day and he was talking about how it's,</v>

296
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.153
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

297
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 2>more of like a moneymaking thing.</v>

298
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 2>Like there's money being made in the,</v>

299
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 2>in the testing world is,</v>

300
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 2>so there's like lobbying being done to make more testing and more testing so</v>

301
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 2>they can make more money because it's just this ridiculous,</v>

302
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:03.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm a firm believer.</v>

303
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 2>Why would you prevent people from enhancing themselves?</v>

304
00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

305
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.800
<v Speaker 2>like you let people take protein supplements that's coming from a cow.</v>

306
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 2>We're taking the way from a cow and we're eating it to make ourselves better.</v>

307
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Why can't we take the growth hormone from a cadaver and use that?</v>

308
00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 2>We don't do that at first of all.</v>

309
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Because if you did do that,</v>

310
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.580
<v Speaker 2>you can get really sick and you can get fucking mad cow disease.</v>

311
00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 2>What we were talking about earlier,</v>

312
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.460
<v Speaker 2>you can get all sorts of crazy diseases.</v>

313
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:28.641
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

314
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:28.971
<v Speaker 2>where did,</v>

315
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 2>you might say it's a synthetic,</v>

316
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:30.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

317
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

318
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually made by bacteria.</v>

319
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.410
<v Speaker 2>It is bacteria.</v>

320
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Bacteria constructed well,</v>

321
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's so,</v>

322
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:39.950
<v Speaker 2>it's a s anything that simulates the amazing process that you and I would never</v>

323
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 2>figure it out.</v>

324
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Give it a billion years at all the books in the world.</v>

325
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 2>You and I would still be sitting around telling fart jokes.</v>

326
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 2>We would never figure it how to make a lot further ahead than I would.</v>

327
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:49.694
<v Speaker 2>I were moans,</v>

328
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Syria.</v>

329
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

330
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:52.041
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

331
00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:53.600
<v Speaker 2>I can't figure out how a toilet works.</v>

332
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing how some people's minds just can do that.</v>

333
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>

334
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 3>it's a variation in the way that the human mind works is so spectacular.</v>

335
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I tried to figure out,</v>

336
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.810
<v Speaker 3>I was watching the way they're testing to figure out how the,</v>

337
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 3>the human growth hormone load the weight.</v>

338
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 3>They've got this like thing that locks onto it so that they can test and I was</v>

339
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 3>watching over and over trying to,</v>

340
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 3>trying to comprehend it.</v>

341
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>

342
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.550
<v Speaker 3>unlike,</v>

343
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking retard.</v>

344
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 3>I can't get this in my head.</v>

345
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 3>Rick Ross would have figured it out.</v>

346
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 3>You probably would have went the real request that we had on yesterday.</v>

347
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.930
<v Speaker 3>Genius Guy that the,</v>

348
00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:27.590
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

349
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 3>the drug dealer,</v>

350
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 3>it was a yeah,</v>

351
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 3>till he was 28 years old.</v>

352
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't read really.</v>

353
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.280
<v Speaker 3>Not only did he teach himself how to read,</v>

354
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 3>but he also taught himself the law and found loopholes in the law.</v>

355
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 3>So he went from being like,</v>

356
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 3>can't even read a book,</v>

357
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 3>Jack and Jill to fucking getting himself out of a life term in prison.</v>

358
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.360
<v Speaker 3>Fucking what was,</v>

359
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:47.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

360
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.990
<v Speaker 3>one of the most amazing,</v>

361
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.370
<v Speaker 3>I think the best podcasts.</v>

362
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just the story wise,</v>

363
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.050
<v Speaker 3>it was just amazing.</v>

364
00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:54.090
<v Speaker 3>And then some rubbers,</v>

365
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:55.220
<v Speaker 3>kind of his identity.</v>

366
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 3>One rappers stole his identity.</v>

367
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:58.890
<v Speaker 3>That would piss me off.</v>

368
00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

369
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:00.174
<v Speaker 3>You'd think,</v>

370
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean they thought it was going to be in jail for life is what it was.</v>

371
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:04.410
<v Speaker 3>He was a legend out on the street.</v>

372
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

374
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:06.420
<v Speaker 3>I had heard his name,</v>

375
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 3>so he's very heard his name when I was living in La.</v>

376
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.480
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't even living in la rather when I heard his name,</v>

377
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 3>like he was that legendary.</v>

378
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:14.191
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

379
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 3>He was legendary as far as like drug dealers in this country.</v>

380
00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:18.390
<v Speaker 3>You would hear him on them and the new stores and stuff,</v>

381
00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:19.860
<v Speaker 3>when he won his trial was going on.</v>

00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 3>Ricky on Twitter.</v>

393
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:35.760
<v Speaker 3>That's what his nickname was,</v>

394

<v Speaker 3>freeway Ricky Ross.</v>

395

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

398
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting to see this guy who was 20 years old in this terrible</v>

399
00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:47.700
<v Speaker 3>situation and sort of just kind of found his way through the system to success.</v>

400
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 3>And then it all came,</v>

401
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:52.530
<v Speaker 3>fallen apart and then he built himself back up again and now he's like a really</v>

402
00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:53.130
<v Speaker 3>cool dude.</v>

403

<v Speaker 3>Really intense,</v>

405
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.560
<v Speaker 3>intense story.</v>

406
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.360
<v Speaker 3>Pissed off about the guy stealing his identity.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>

408

<v Speaker 3>You should be the then,</v>

410
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

411
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.380
<v Speaker 3>we can't talk about it.</v>

412
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.861
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

413
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 3>there's part of it that we can't talk about for legal issues.</v>

414
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.180
<v Speaker 3>So there's a,</v>

415
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.440
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy in Australia,</v>

416
00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever seen the movie chopper.</v>

417
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:09.571
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I love that fucking movie.</v>

420
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.810
<v Speaker 3>It's Eric Bana.</v>

421
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:14.670
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

422
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 3>supposedly all true.</v>

423
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

424
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

425
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:18.960
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

426
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.460
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't seen the film,</v>

427
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:22.110
<v Speaker 3>the guy got thrown in prison,</v>

428
00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

429
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.660
<v Speaker 3>he was like a hit man kind of for drug dealers.</v>

430
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.620
<v Speaker 3>He gets thrown in prison and they're going to send them to like the wing of the</v>

431
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:31.080
<v Speaker 3>prison where the guys that want to kill him are.</v>

432
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.460
<v Speaker 3>So instead of going there,</v>

433
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 3>he cut his own ears off so that they'd put them in the crazy ward.</v>

434
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.730
<v Speaker 3>And now he's got these like fucked up years.</v>

435
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 3>But what a great idea.</v>

436
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.093
<v Speaker 3>But he's,</v>

437
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 3>he's just crazy,</v>

438
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:44.610
<v Speaker 3>legendary Australia and the people kind of like,</v>

439
00:11:44.611 --> 00:11:44.941
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

440
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:46.340
<v Speaker 3>he's like a folk hero on that.</v>

441
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.490
<v Speaker 3>But there was,</v>

442
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.380
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy now on the fuck up,</v>

443
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy who does a parody of them and does a show and tours</v>

444
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.860
<v Speaker 4>to like sold out shows everywhere.</v>

445
00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:57.790
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

446
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.623
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

447
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 4>and I just did his show,</v>

448
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 4>like he does a show where he hosts it and he,</v>

449
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 4>I did the Adelaide comedy festival and I did his show.</v>

450
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:05.621
<v Speaker 4>It's a late night.</v>

451
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 4>It's a heath.</v>

452
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 4>Franklin is the guy.</v>

453
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:08.920
<v Speaker 4>He does chopper it,</v>

454
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:09.221
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

455
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 4>he plays chopper and he's in character doing standup and it's good.</v>

456
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.193
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

457
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:14.741
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

458
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 4>Stand up.</v>

459
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.240
<v Speaker 4>And then he's doing it as chopper and every joke is about like misogyny and</v>

460
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:20.790
<v Speaker 4>fucking harden the fuck up and,</v>

461
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Speaker 4>and he's got the mustache on and the sunglasses and I set afterwards because I</v>

462
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:25.901
<v Speaker 4>had heard rumors,</v>

463

465
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:28.931
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

466
00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:29.500
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

467
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.333
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

468
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.900
<v Speaker 4>Apparently he's not very happy.</v>

469
00:12:31.901 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

470
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.600
<v Speaker 4>why don't you fuck with a guy like that?</v>

471
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:36.370
<v Speaker 4>Christ the guy who will come in.</v>

472
00:12:36.371 --> 00:12:37.470
<v Speaker 4>You're not in your wheelhouse.</v>

473
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:38.201
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

474
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:38.890
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking crazy.</v>

475
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 4>If you watch the movie,</v>

476
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:40.061
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

477
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:40.691
<v Speaker 4>if you haven't seen it,</v>

478
00:12:40.691 --> 00:12:41.910
<v Speaker 4>it's a great movie.</v>

479
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.820
<v Speaker 4>It's really fun.</v>

480
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:43.440
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

481
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.490
<v Speaker 4>You're rooting for this.</v>

482
00:12:44.491 --> 00:12:49.491
<v Speaker 4>Psychopath Australia makes great co like criminal can crime films like that.</v>

483
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:50.140
<v Speaker 4>They have,</v>

484
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.500
<v Speaker 4>they have a show or they had a movie called Animal House Watch.</v>

485
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:54.880
<v Speaker 4>Animal House about this family.</v>

486
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.431
<v Speaker 4>I have the,</v>

487
00:12:55.431 --> 00:12:55.800
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

488
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

489
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:56.980
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking great.</v>

490
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.780
<v Speaker 4>Explain how he gets to do that.</v>

491
00:12:58.781 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 4>If choppers still alive.</v>

492
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

493
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:01.691
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

494
00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Speaker 4>do you have to pay him a commission?</v>

495
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:04.360
<v Speaker 4>Do you nothing.</v>

496
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.090
<v Speaker 4>Tours and sells out shows everywhere.</v>

497
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:07.963
<v Speaker 4>Reason.</v>

498
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.920
<v Speaker 4>That seems crazy.</v>

499
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:10.810
<v Speaker 4>That seems like you're asking for trouble.</v>

500
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Speaker 4>You should give that guy a piece.</v>

501
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.031
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

502
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean I guess it's kind of the same.</v>

503
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

504
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like guys that do impressions.</v>

505
00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the way he does it,</v>

506
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 4>but it's a full sun impression.</v>

507
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.760
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm just going to change my name.</v>

508
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 4>Did Louie Anderson?</v>

509
00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:23.710
<v Speaker 4>If I have to do anywhere else,</v>

510
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.590
<v Speaker 4>I'll come down hard on you.</v>

511
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:27.803
<v Speaker 4>Louie.</v>

512
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.213
<v Speaker 4>Louie.</v>

513
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.310
<v Speaker 4>Louie will come down hard on your son,</v>

514
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.483
<v Speaker 4>both of you.</v>

515
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.960
<v Speaker 4>What are you saying and why are you saying it on the Internet?</v>

516
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.273
<v Speaker 4>Like spanking.</v>

517
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:45.550
<v Speaker 4>I was getting nervous on your show because your fans are so diligent about</v>

518
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:46.563
<v Speaker 4>facts.</v>

519
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.381
<v Speaker 4>Too brutal.</v>

520
00:13:47.381 --> 00:13:48.214
<v Speaker 4>They're brutal.</v>

521
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.760
<v Speaker 4>Twitter's like last time I was here I was talking about grass fed meat stuff.</v>

522
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:53.320
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

523
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.510
<v Speaker 4>cows or pigs can't be grass fed.</v>

524
00:13:55.511 --> 00:13:56.344
<v Speaker 4>They get sunburned.</v>

525
00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.060
<v Speaker 4>They do some of that.</v>

526
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:00.521
<v Speaker 4>They do.</v>

527
00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:01.240
<v Speaker 4>If you think about it,</v>

528
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.420
<v Speaker 4>this pink pigs he's like so they have to be under so they can't be eating grass</v>

529
00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:05.210
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>

530
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.400
<v Speaker 4>That totally makes sense.</v>

531
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:07.391
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

532
00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:09.190
<v Speaker 4>I would think where the real pink like that.</v>

533
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.890
<v Speaker 4>What kind of protection from the sun is that you?</v>

534
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:11.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

535
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.910
<v Speaker 4>They'd probably get all fucked up.</v>

536
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.871
<v Speaker 4>Cause imagine ribbons,</v>

537
00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:15.490
<v Speaker 4>Suntan lotion all over the cow.</v>

538
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:16.751
<v Speaker 4>Pig Man.</v>

539
00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:17.584
<v Speaker 4>A Perry got a cow.</v>

540
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.210
<v Speaker 4>Pigs are so weird because pigs are the only animal that we know of that becomes</v>

541
00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:23.044
<v Speaker 4>feral.</v>

542
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:28.050
<v Speaker 4>Meaning it becomes wild almost immediately from the release from a farm and it</v>

543
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:30.280
<v Speaker 4>actually physically changes shape.</v>

544
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.480
<v Speaker 4>It's real weird.</v>

545
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.130
<v Speaker 4>There are for changes,</v>

546
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:36.760
<v Speaker 4>it becomes like darker and thicker and Busher and their tusks grow longer and</v>

547
00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:38.710
<v Speaker 4>their snout actually grows long.</v>

548
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:40.780
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's how they should naturally be.</v>

549
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.040
<v Speaker 4>But so weird though that.</v>

550
00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:44.930
<v Speaker 4>Why doesn't that happen when they're in the best case?</v>

551
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.660
<v Speaker 4>Cause they're probably feeding them shitty food.</v>

552
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's it,</v>

553
00:14:47.861 --> 00:14:48.251
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

554
00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Somebody told me what's the best way to get rid of a body?</v>

555
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 4>It's just</v>

556
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.700
<v Speaker 1>pigs in the way the movie snatch.</v>

557
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

558
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Did they do it?</v>

559
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

560
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:54.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

561
00:14:54.881 --> 00:14:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I remember the guy was a eeky or I'm like,</v>

562
00:14:57.501 --> 00:14:57.721
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

563
00:14:57.721 --> 00:14:58.554
<v Speaker 1>we keep some pigs.</v>

564
00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

565
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.720
<v Speaker 1>that guy was a great action with those shoot super coke bottle glasses like I</v>

566
00:15:02.721 --> 00:15:06.840
<v Speaker 1>was the shit wasn't in the sopranos also or am I just thinking match?</v>

567
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I definitely in snap,</v>

568
00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

569
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.620
<v Speaker 1>but that's a,</v>

570
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.421
<v Speaker 1>I asked a guy once,</v>

571
00:15:10.421 --> 00:15:11.540
<v Speaker 1>he's gotten rid of a body,</v>

572
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

573
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.210
<v Speaker 1>what's the best way to get rid of a body?</v>

574
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:15.110
<v Speaker 1>And he said go fishing.</v>

575
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:16.131
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

576
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:16.370
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

577
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

578
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.250
<v Speaker 1>go fishing and throw them in the water.</v>

579
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Like you go far enough out in the ocean if you're lucky,</v>

580
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:24.530
<v Speaker 1>if you're not lucky,</v>

581
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.431
<v Speaker 1>not lucky.</v>

582
00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:28.210
<v Speaker 1>That bitch floats to shore up your tying up here.</v>

583
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.090
<v Speaker 1>You got to tie him up.</v>

584
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:29.924
<v Speaker 1>Dexter style,</v>

585
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.510
<v Speaker 1>pubic hair of yours doesn't it?</v>

586
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.680
<v Speaker 1>But if you think about it,</v>

587
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's probably a good bet.</v>

588
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of God damn real estate out there.</v>

589
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.020
<v Speaker 1>What people are buried out there.</v>

590
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.510
<v Speaker 1>How many people do you think are buried on the weight in Nevada?</v>

591
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:42.371
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

592
00:15:42.371 --> 00:15:43.071
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

593
00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:43.904
<v Speaker 1>Dirt road.</v>

594
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Those off to the side where you see like we're dirt roads through the chicken</v>

595
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:49.101
<v Speaker 1>wire.</v>

596
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that?</v>

597
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.560
<v Speaker 1>What's going on back there?</v>

598
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Who owns that checks that for bodies.</v>

599
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Who skins that they were the fucking metal.</v>

600
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.140
<v Speaker 1>The sexy looking for watches.</v>

601
00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.360
<v Speaker 1>The people that got burnt up.</v>

602
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it's funny when they find one,</v>

603
00:16:00.741 --> 00:16:02.030
<v Speaker 1>remember that bodybuilder?</v>

604
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.200
<v Speaker 1>I was just about to bring that up.</v>

605
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:03.981
<v Speaker 1>Chris Titus.</v>

606
00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

607
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he tried?</v>

608
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:05.331
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

609
00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Chris Titus was no immediate immediate.</v>

610
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Craig situs said it.</v>

611
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.883
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>

612
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:10.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

613
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:11.660
<v Speaker 1>it's all on my shit wrong.</v>

614
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>He killed his personal assistant.</v>

615
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:14.900
<v Speaker 1>He and his wife,</v>

616
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.490
<v Speaker 1>because he was fucking her I think.</v>

617
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.473
<v Speaker 1>And his wife,</v>

618
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.880
<v Speaker 1>his wife caught them and so I guess he and his wife decided to get rid of her.</v>

619
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

620
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:22.770
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

621
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.650
<v Speaker 1>that's the best way to handle getting caught cheating.</v>

622
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.490
<v Speaker 1>And they killed her and then they took her out to the desert.</v>

623
00:16:27.491 --> 00:16:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Craig Titus and they were going to like light the Er.</v>

624
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.790
<v Speaker 1>They were lighting on fire and air or,</v>

625
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:32.031
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

626
00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:34.620
<v Speaker 1>the car and her and me.</v>

627
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I remember this guy,</v>

628
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:36.980
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

629
00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.510
<v Speaker 1>he was so juice to the gills.</v>

630
00:16:38.511 --> 00:16:40.050
<v Speaker 1>You're so crazy that he would actually,</v>

631
00:16:40.051 --> 00:16:44.990
<v Speaker 1>it was like challenging Phil Baroni who was saying that he wanted to fight Phil</v>

632
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Baroni when Phil Baroni was,</v>

633
00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:46.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

634
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

635
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.010
<v Speaker 1>feel brony when he was young was one of the scariest knockout punches in the,</v>

636
00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:52.520
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC middleweight division.</v>

637
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.590
<v Speaker 1>He didn't beat like a lot of the top guys,</v>

638
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:59.830
<v Speaker 1>but he's a tough motherfucker for some crazy body builder to come along and say</v>

639
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:00.680
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

640
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

641
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.660
<v Speaker 1>go watch that Dave [inaudible] fight.</v>

642
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Go Watch Phil Baroni light.</v>

643
00:17:04.881 --> 00:17:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Dave Manet up with like 15 punches in a row while standing while he's already</v>

644
00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:10.154
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

645
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.010
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even have a chance to hit the ground and broke his hip.</v>

646
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.721
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding,</v>

647
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:14.901
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

648
00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:16.550
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the greatest highlight,</v>

649
00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:21.551
<v Speaker 1>real chaos of all time and this fucking Douche bag Jews head who just lifts</v>

650
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:22.760
<v Speaker 1>weights,</v>

651
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.050
<v Speaker 1>thinks he's going to fuck with that.</v>

652
00:17:24.051 --> 00:17:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Like it's hilarious.</v>

653
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:26.181
<v Speaker 1>This guy's,</v>

654
00:17:26.181 --> 00:17:28.520
<v Speaker 1>they get so full of testosterone and there's so,</v>

655
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:28.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

656
00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:30.890
<v Speaker 1>they're literally not even human anymore.</v>

657
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.370
<v Speaker 1>If you see as some of those guys when they hit those crazy levels of</v>

658
00:17:34.371 --> 00:17:36.410
<v Speaker 1>testosterone that you need to get that big.</v>

659
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:37.560
<v Speaker 1>I used to work out at that goal.</v>

660
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Jim and his,</v>

661
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.310
<v Speaker 1>his picture was on the wall.</v>

662
00:17:40.311 --> 00:17:43.030
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the guys they want to in Venice and not human.</v>

663
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Like the day that happened,</v>

664
00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I think I was in there and the guy was on a ladder pulling the picture.</v>

665
00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:48.573
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

666
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:48.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

667
00:17:48.881 --> 00:17:49.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

668
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:49.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

669
00:17:49.831 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

670
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.820
<v Speaker 2>he's a disgrace.</v>

671
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.250
<v Speaker 2>But I mean like when you get like that big,</v>

672
00:17:53.251 --> 00:17:54.540
<v Speaker 2>like Lee Haney big,</v>

673
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:55.381
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

674
00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 2>That's not human.</v>

675
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.391
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

676
00:17:57.391 --> 00:17:57.840
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

677
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:57.991
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

678
00:17:57.991 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 2>it's an insult.</v>

679
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.690
<v Speaker 2>But it would also feel like,</v>

680
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.730
<v Speaker 2>like I'm a little guy,</v>

681
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I weigh like 170 pounds and I,</v>

682
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.821
<v Speaker 2>I work out a lot.</v>

683
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:08.220
<v Speaker 2>I do crossfit like six days a week.</v>

684
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.020
<v Speaker 2>And when I started here frequently,</v>

685
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:10.351
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

686
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 2>When I start to work out where I'm doing a lot of Olympic lifting and power</v>

687
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:14.491
<v Speaker 2>lifting and stuff,</v>

688
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 2>where I start to get a little heavier and up to blink 180 my,</v>

689
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I feel uncomfortable,</v>

690
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:20.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

691
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:23.640
<v Speaker 2>just like losing all my mobility and everything.</v>

692
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:24.803
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

693
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:25.330
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

694
00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:25.830
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

695
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.930
<v Speaker 2>they're like handicapped.</v>

696
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.390
<v Speaker 2>That's also an issue of what you're doing for exercise.</v>

697
00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted mobility,</v>

698
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:32.424
<v Speaker 2>you should be nodded.</v>

699
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

700
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

701
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.070
<v Speaker 2>but not at that size.</v>

702
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Do heavyweights.</v>

703
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.701
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

704
00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:36.880
<v Speaker 2>But I do a lot everything,</v>

705
00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:37.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

706
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.520
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of metcons and stuff,</v>

707
00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:39.354
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

708
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying when you get to that bodybuilder size,</v>

709
00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:43.860
<v Speaker 2>like Lee Haney size,</v>

710
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.480
<v Speaker 2>you lose,</v>

711
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.710
<v Speaker 2>you're almost like a handicapped person when you're taking your shirt on.</v>

712
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:54.120
<v Speaker 2>You'd be amazed at how well some guys can move with a lot of muscle that have</v>

713
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.013
<v Speaker 2>stretched out.</v>

714
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:55.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

715
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.280
<v Speaker 2>That's really what it is.</v>

716
00:18:56.281 --> 00:18:58.410
<v Speaker 2>It's all about like flexibility and it's all,</v>

717
00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.161
<v Speaker 2>there's guys like,</v>

718
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:00.720
<v Speaker 2>there's this kid named Todd Duffy,</v>

719
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.170
<v Speaker 2>he's a heavyweight contender and he probably weighs,</v>

720
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I'd say weighs around two 40 ish,</v>

721
00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.900
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in that looks like a fucking like some sort of a,</v>

722
00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:11.970
<v Speaker 2>an action comic hero.</v>

723
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:12.630
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really,</v>

724
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.790
<v Speaker 2>we were real human and he's huge.</v>

725
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.410
<v Speaker 2>He's just swollen muscles everywhere.</v>

726
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.270
<v Speaker 2>And this mother fucker moves like a cat.</v>

727
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Like it's creepy to watch them.</v>

728
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.560
<v Speaker 2>It's creepy to watch them jump on dudes and punch them cause you're like,</v>

729
00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:23.011
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

730
00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:24.360
<v Speaker 2>he's not supposed to move that quick.</v>

731
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Like it's uncomfortable and one of the reasons why he can move so quick as he's</v>

732
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:33.330
<v Speaker 2>a real athlete stretches everything and he doesn't just do you if you're doing</v>

733
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Olympic cleans,</v>

734
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:40.020
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing dead lifts and if you're doing like power squats you at whatever</v>

735
00:19:40.021 --> 00:19:41.400
<v Speaker 2>time you spend doing that,</v>

736
00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:45.120
<v Speaker 2>you should spend twice that amount of time stretching out and getting deep</v>

737
00:19:45.121 --> 00:19:45.950
<v Speaker 2>tissue massage.</v>

738
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

739
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.180
<v Speaker 2>So for every two hours you're lifting,</v>

740
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:49.080
<v Speaker 2>it should be four hours,</v>

741
00:19:49.081 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 2>two hours deep tissue in two hours stretching.</v>

742
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.080
<v Speaker 2>That's not bullshit.</v>

743
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.170
<v Speaker 2>You like you really need to stretch everything.</v>

744
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.440
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time.</v>

745
00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.390
<v Speaker 2>I that I don't fuck around cause when I first got into crossfit I thought it was</v>

746
00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:03.750
<v Speaker 2>cool that you'll need to work out for like sometimes three minutes.</v>

747
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.490
<v Speaker 2>The workouts are sometimes three minutes.</v>

748
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

749
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:06.570
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

750
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 2>if you're good at it,</v>

751
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:08.304
<v Speaker 2>like a friend,</v>

752
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:13.460
<v Speaker 2>a good friend time is three is three minutes of Fran Fran who would be a 95</v>

753
00:20:13.771 --> 00:20:17.070
<v Speaker 2>pound thruster 21 times.</v>

754
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.720
<v Speaker 2>Then 20 a thruster has a structure,</v>

755
00:20:18.721 --> 00:20:19.081
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

756
00:20:19.081 --> 00:20:19.740
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

757
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.760
<v Speaker 2>we got to clean it first.</v>

758
00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Then you go into a squat and then end up push press over your head.</v>

759
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

760
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.620
<v Speaker 2>So you do that 21 times,</v>

761
00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 2>then you go straight to the pull up bar 21 times,</v>

762
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.030
<v Speaker 2>then you do 15 thrusters,</v>

763
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.020
<v Speaker 2>15 pull ups,</v>

764
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:31.980
<v Speaker 2>then nine thrusters,</v>

765
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:32.820
<v Speaker 2>nine pullups.</v>

766
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:33.271
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

767
00:20:33.271 --> 00:20:35.070
<v Speaker 2>so that's like 90 reps or something.</v>

768
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.810
<v Speaker 2>But you're doing who'd done,</v>

769
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:37.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

770
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:37.491
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

771
00:20:37.491 --> 00:20:38.880
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking done.</v>

772
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.920
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

773
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.890
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

774
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

775
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.420
<v Speaker 2>they have that scheme rep gain with like you could do it with like handstand</v>

776
00:20:45.421 --> 00:20:47.100
<v Speaker 2>pushups and dead lifts,</v>

777
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 2>which</v>

778
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.550
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

779
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:49.690
<v Speaker 4>is a pretty tough one to,</v>

780
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:49.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

781
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.820
<v Speaker 4>and it was all just blowing it out,</v>

782
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:52.331
<v Speaker 4>blown out.</v>

783
00:20:52.331 --> 00:20:54.190
<v Speaker 4>Some of them are up to 20 minutes long,</v>

784
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:54.910
<v Speaker 4>some of them are,</v>

785
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:55.840
<v Speaker 4>some of them are,</v>

786
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:56.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

787
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 4>like fight gone bad.</v>

788
00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.090
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

789
00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:58.631
<v Speaker 4>what's his name?</v>

790
00:20:58.631 --> 00:20:58.871
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

791
00:20:58.871 --> 00:21:02.430
<v Speaker 4>the wrestler or the the UFC fighter did,</v>

792
00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.200
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Dana White did it with the crossfit.</v>

793
00:21:05.201 --> 00:21:06.220
<v Speaker 4>They put it together and they said,</v>

794
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.800
<v Speaker 4>let's simulate a UFC fight.</v>

795
00:21:08.801 --> 00:21:09.371
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

796
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:09.641
<v Speaker 4>what are you,</v>

797
00:21:09.641 --> 00:21:10.690
<v Speaker 4>five minutes and then,</v>

798
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.190
<v Speaker 4>or what's around three five minute rounds?</v>

799
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:13.950
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

800
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:14.381
<v Speaker 4>and how many?</v>

801
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:15.620
<v Speaker 4>Three three in them,</v>

802
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.580
<v Speaker 4>the regular fights and five and championship and main event fights.</v>

803
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:19.690
<v Speaker 4>So this is like five,</v>

804
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:23.800
<v Speaker 4>five minute rounds with one minute break and in between each one and you row.</v>

805
00:21:23.801 --> 00:21:24.790
<v Speaker 4>Then you do push presses,</v>

806
00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:25.451
<v Speaker 4>box jumps,</v>

807
00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:29.950
<v Speaker 4>everything and you do as many reps as you can get in of these things like a</v>

808
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.350
<v Speaker 4>minute each and then you switch to the next thing for a minute and it's five</v>

809
00:21:32.351 --> 00:21:34.150
<v Speaker 4>things in five minutes.</v>

810
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.540
<v Speaker 4>Then you take a minute break five and they asked him afterwards and they're</v>

811
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:37.631
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

812
00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:38.464
<v Speaker 4>what was that like?</v>

813
00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.313
<v Speaker 4>Was that like a fight?</v>

814
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:39.791
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

815
00:21:39.791 --> 00:21:42.640
<v Speaker 4>it was like a fight gone bat and it just,</v>

816
00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.050
<v Speaker 4>it beats the fuck out of you.</v>

817
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.590
<v Speaker 4>But I used to go into the gym without warming up thinking I could do it.</v>

818
00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:48.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

819
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:48.780
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

820
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:49.990
<v Speaker 4>and I could.</v>

821
00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.760
<v Speaker 4>But then I developed so many issues with like bad back bad.</v>

822
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:57.310
<v Speaker 4>Let me bring this up then because tendinitis,</v>

823
00:21:57.311 --> 00:22:01.660
<v Speaker 4>Steve Maxwell is a guy that I trained with a bunch of times of a brilliant guy,</v>

824
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:04.240
<v Speaker 4>really well known for being a fitness guru,</v>

825
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:07.150
<v Speaker 4>and he thinks that those high repetition,</v>

826
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.180
<v Speaker 4>dead lift things that get done a lot in crossfit.</v>

827
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:10.600
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

828
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.770
<v Speaker 4>you're not supposed to do that.</v>

829
00:22:11.771 --> 00:22:13.970
<v Speaker 4>That's not how those exercises are designed.</v>

830
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.030
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

831
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:15.411
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

832
00:22:15.411 --> 00:22:16.390
<v Speaker 4>Potential for injury.</v>

833
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.081
<v Speaker 4>Yes and no.</v>

834
00:22:17.081 --> 00:22:17.321
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

835
00:22:17.321 --> 00:22:18.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm sitting here right now with,</v>

836
00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:22.960
<v Speaker 4>I've got a bad disc because I did 155 pound power clean or squat,</v>

837
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.770
<v Speaker 4>squat.</v>

838
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:24.250
<v Speaker 4>What was it?</v>

839
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.510
<v Speaker 4>155 pound dude.</v>

840
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.520
<v Speaker 4>Once you stop fucking around and take Jujitsu,</v>

841
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.020
<v Speaker 4>just learners,</v>

842
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:29.681
<v Speaker 4>triangle people.</v>

843
00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:31.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the roll around with men.</v>

844
00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:31.871
<v Speaker 4>I'm the little,</v>

845
00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:32.860
<v Speaker 4>when you choke the fuck,</v>

846
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:34.270
<v Speaker 4>listen man,</v>

847
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.130
<v Speaker 4>I do have aggression.</v>

848
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.250
<v Speaker 4>I do have aggression.</v>

849
00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:37.480
<v Speaker 4>I do probably like that.</v>

850
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:38.080
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

851
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:38.381
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

852
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:39.214
<v Speaker 4>you would love it.</v>

853
00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.150
<v Speaker 4>You're a man.</v>

854
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:40.780
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

855
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.190
<v Speaker 4>it would help you tremendously.</v>

856
00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:43.180
<v Speaker 4>You're so into fitness,</v>

857
00:22:43.181 --> 00:22:44.500
<v Speaker 4>but you're not even getting the rewards.</v>

858
00:22:44.501 --> 00:22:46.600
<v Speaker 4>I know they're getting a skill.</v>

859
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:47.740
<v Speaker 4>These workout I did the other day,</v>

860
00:22:47.741 --> 00:22:52.741
<v Speaker 4>it was 155 pound a squat clean and jerk 30 times as fast as you can do it to see</v>

861
00:22:55.781 --> 00:22:56.321
<v Speaker 4>that's where it,</v>

862
00:22:56.321 --> 00:22:57.520
<v Speaker 4>Maxwell has an issue with it.</v>

863
00:22:57.521 --> 00:22:58.000
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

864
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.750
<v Speaker 4>he's his issue is that when you're doing these high rep exercises,</v>

865
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.180
<v Speaker 4>there's just too much potential for fuckups.</v>

866
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:06.100
<v Speaker 4>Here's he's right then,</v>

867
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.180
<v Speaker 4>and I hurt myself because I am talking to Sean Waxman who was an Olympic lifting</v>

868
00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:11.014
<v Speaker 4>like expert,</v>

869
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:11.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

870
00:23:11.321 --> 00:23:12.970
<v Speaker 4>he was like a national champion or whatever.</v>

871
00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:13.983
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

872
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:16.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't have my technique.</v>

873
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a high technique thing.</v>

874
00:23:17.951 --> 00:23:19.150
<v Speaker 4>If you're an Olympic weight lifter,</v>

875
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.190
<v Speaker 4>it has to be so precise.</v>

876
00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:22.540
<v Speaker 4>It's like fucking ballet.</v>

877
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.710
<v Speaker 4>How good you have to be.</v>

878
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:25.510
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] when they have that woman,</v>

879
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:27.970
<v Speaker 4>they locked her arms overhead and squatted,</v>

880
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:33.010
<v Speaker 4>it's overhead press and the fucking bar is like way too heavy for them.</v>

881
00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:33.371
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

882
00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Speaker 4>they just got up there with trickery.</v>

883
00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:35.441
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

884
00:23:35.441 --> 00:23:36.274
<v Speaker 4>they did some,</v>

885
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.550
<v Speaker 4>they did that crazy Natchez fucking unbelievable.</v>

886
00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:40.780
<v Speaker 4>It's wiggling over the head.</v>

887
00:23:40.781 --> 00:23:40.991
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

888
00:23:40.991 --> 00:23:41.421
<v Speaker 4>my God,</v>

889
00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:42.490
<v Speaker 4>if that falls in your skull,</v>

890
00:23:42.491 --> 00:23:44.920
<v Speaker 4>your duns dead done dead.</v>

891
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.321
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

892
00:23:45.321 --> 00:23:45.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

893
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.440
<v Speaker 4>I saw a GoGet</v>

894
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 5>crushed by a a bench ones.</v>

895
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.840
<v Speaker 5>He was benching and went away over his head and he fucking,</v>

896
00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 5>his arm just gave out and it comes down on him hard.</v>

897
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:55.400
<v Speaker 5>It goes to his neck,</v>

898
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:56.300
<v Speaker 5>everybody's screaming,</v>

899
00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:58.340
<v Speaker 5>they're running over and pull up the weights off of them.</v>

900
00:23:58.341 --> 00:23:59.130
<v Speaker 5>It was fucking pen</v>

901
00:23:59.130 --> 00:23:59.520
<v Speaker 4>pneumonia.</v>

902
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.360
<v Speaker 4>You can spend five hours on youtube crying your eyes out laughing at</v>

903
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.670
<v Speaker 4>weightlifting nails.</v>

904
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.520
<v Speaker 4>And the best is the guys passing out after a lift.</v>

905
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.740
<v Speaker 4>That's the funniest dude.</v>

906
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:14.070
<v Speaker 4>Like a big dead lifted fall forward on his face.</v>

907
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.560
<v Speaker 5>Guys have died from that.</v>

908
00:24:15.561 --> 00:24:17.740
<v Speaker 5>Guys have had hernias or rather aneurysm.</v>

909
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 4>I had a one time in the middle of a workout I had,</v>

910
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.480
<v Speaker 4>I think it was an exertion headache or something.</v>

911
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:24.314
<v Speaker 4>We're just,</v>

912
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.880
<v Speaker 4>I knew like an,</v>

913
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:27.080
<v Speaker 4>I try never to quit.</v>

914
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.820
<v Speaker 4>I just looked at everyone and I went,</v>

915
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:29.683
<v Speaker 4>I'm out,</v>

916
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:30.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm out.</v>

917
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:33.260
<v Speaker 4>Cause my head started like pulsating.</v>

918
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.740
<v Speaker 4>Ooo,</v>

919
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.680
<v Speaker 4>and and it was a lot that they teach you to like,</v>

920
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.281
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

921
00:24:37.281 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times you were taught like breathe in and then on the downward,</v>

922
00:24:40.971 --> 00:24:41.300
<v Speaker 4>on the,</v>

923
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.590
<v Speaker 4>on the ecentric and on the concentric you,</v>

924
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:44.630
<v Speaker 4>you exhale.</v>

925
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.650
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of times in our kind of lifting they say hold your breath because it</v>

926
00:24:48.651 --> 00:24:49.820
<v Speaker 4>locks your core.</v>

927
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.130
<v Speaker 4>If you hold your breath throughout the whole lift,</v>

928
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.630
<v Speaker 4>like bogged down.</v>

929
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.490
<v Speaker 4>And then once you finish the lift,</v>

930
00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:56.443
<v Speaker 4>exhale,</v>

931
00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.180
<v Speaker 4>it locks your core together,</v>

932
00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.380
<v Speaker 4>locks your spine and it keeps more control.</v>

933
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.390
<v Speaker 4>So like just hold,</v>

934
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:03.261
<v Speaker 4>take a deep breath,</v>

935
00:25:03.261 --> 00:25:04.430
<v Speaker 4>hold on the way down.</v>

936
00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.293
<v Speaker 4>Hold on the way up.</v>

937
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.133
<v Speaker 4>Exhale.</v>

938
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.380
<v Speaker 4>So I was doing that and all of sudden it was like,</v>

939
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.230
<v Speaker 4>like I popped something in my head and I went,</v>

940
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:12.621
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

941
00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:13.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to die.</v>

942
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:18.200
<v Speaker 4>I really thought aneurism or something and I went to was just a little mini one.</v>

943
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.250
<v Speaker 4>Don't tell me that.</v>

944
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.173
<v Speaker 4>Cause aneurysms.</v>

945
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.500
<v Speaker 4>Well actually that's the way to go.</v>

946
00:25:21.501 --> 00:25:22.334
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

947
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.821
<v Speaker 4>you're out.</v>

948
00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:23.211
<v Speaker 4>You're dead,</v>

949
00:25:23.211 --> 00:25:24.044
<v Speaker 4>you're gone.</v>

950
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.670
<v Speaker 4>You learned my grandmother.</v>

951
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:26.670
<v Speaker 4>Aw.</v>

952
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.930
<v Speaker 5>My grandmother had an aneurysm.</v>

953
00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.310
<v Speaker 5>They gave her 72 hours.</v>

954
00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.600
<v Speaker 5>She lived 12 years.</v>

955
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.570
<v Speaker 5>But she has Sicilian peasant genetics.</v>

956
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.360
<v Speaker 5>There's fucking those peasant genes,</v>

957
00:25:36.361 --> 00:25:38.720
<v Speaker 5>those brick carrying savages that's uh,</v>

958
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.050
<v Speaker 5>a hardy people.</v>

959
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.100
<v Speaker 5>She survived.</v>

960
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:41.700
<v Speaker 5>Aw.</v>

961
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

962
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:42.630
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

963
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:43.770
<v Speaker 5>no one ever took care of them.</v>

964
00:25:43.771 --> 00:25:44.490
<v Speaker 5>How their health,</v>

965
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.170
<v Speaker 5>everyone's just eating Italian food.</v>

966
00:25:46.171 --> 00:25:48.360
<v Speaker 5>It was always meat balls and Lasagna.</v>

967
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.351
<v Speaker 5>I would go over their house.</v>

968
00:25:49.351 --> 00:25:50.400
<v Speaker 5>It was just ridiculous.</v>

969
00:25:50.401 --> 00:25:53.040
<v Speaker 5>My grandmother always made homemade pasta,</v>

970
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.461
<v Speaker 5>homemade,</v>

971
00:25:53.461 --> 00:25:53.940
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

972
00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.310
<v Speaker 5>Everything was fucking sausages.</v>

973
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:57.270
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] sauce.</v>

974
00:25:57.271 --> 00:26:00.060
<v Speaker 5>And it was just aneurisms.</v>

975
00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.610
<v Speaker 5>It was just called cholesterol.</v>

976
00:26:01.611 --> 00:26:01.861
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

977
00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:02.320
<v Speaker 5>oh wait.</v>

978
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.470
<v Speaker 5>Natha how's the,</v>

979
00:26:03.471 --> 00:26:03.930
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>

980
00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:05.010
<v Speaker 5>she lived for 12 years.</v>

981
00:26:05.011 --> 00:26:06.240
<v Speaker 5>My grandfather had to take care of her.</v>

982
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:07.230
<v Speaker 5>It was a,</v>

983
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.790
<v Speaker 5>it was amazing to watch,</v>

984
00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:09.260
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

985
00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.410
<v Speaker 5>It was amazing to watch.</v>

986
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.280
<v Speaker 5>It was one time,</v>

987
00:26:11.281 --> 00:26:12.114
<v Speaker 5>this is really,</v>

988
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's very sentimental,</v>

989
00:26:13.861 --> 00:26:14.694
<v Speaker 5>but it was,</v>

990
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.270
<v Speaker 5>he was standing over and she couldn't wipe her ass.</v>

991
00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.051
<v Speaker 5>She couldn't do anything.</v>

992
00:26:19.051 --> 00:26:19.261
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

993
00:26:19.261 --> 00:26:20.100
<v Speaker 5>She had bed sores.</v>

994
00:26:20.101 --> 00:26:23.010
<v Speaker 5>He had a Turner to make sure that she didn't have bed sores.</v>

995
00:26:23.011 --> 00:26:23.844
<v Speaker 5>You had to,</v>

996
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.810
<v Speaker 5>and she would still get them.</v>

997
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:25.201
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

998
00:26:25.201 --> 00:26:26.400
<v Speaker 5>she's in bed all the time.</v>

999
00:26:26.401 --> 00:26:28.190
<v Speaker 5>It's constantly rubbing up for 12 years,</v>

1000
00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.040
<v Speaker 5>12 years.</v>

1001
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:29.640
<v Speaker 5>And she could barely,</v>

1002
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.030
<v Speaker 5>she was barely lucid and she would make crazy noises and sometimes she was there</v>

1003
00:26:33.031 --> 00:26:33.930
<v Speaker 5>and sometimes she wasn't.</v>

1004
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.350
<v Speaker 5>But she was essentially trapped in her own body for the rest of her days.</v>

1005
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:38.580
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1006
00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.121
<v Speaker 5>it was hard,</v>

1007
00:26:39.121 --> 00:26:39.331
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1008
00:26:39.331 --> 00:26:42.630
<v Speaker 5>because I was living with them at the time for a little bit when I first moved</v>

1009
00:26:42.631 --> 00:26:43.230
<v Speaker 5>to New York,</v>

1010
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.190
<v Speaker 5>didn't have enough money for my own apartment and my grandparents lived in New</v>

1011
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.910
<v Speaker 5>Jersey,</v>

1012
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.840
<v Speaker 5>north New Jersey.</v>

1013
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:51.480
<v Speaker 5>They had been there since like the 30s when it was an all Italian neighborhood.</v>

1014
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:55.410
<v Speaker 5>And now it's become this like hodgepodge of like third world people and really</v>

1015
00:26:55.411 --> 00:26:56.340
<v Speaker 5>poor black people.</v>

1016
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:56.940
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1017
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.490
<v Speaker 5>it's not a good neighborhood at all by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

1018
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:00.481
<v Speaker 5>And My,</v>

1019
00:27:00.481 --> 00:27:00.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1020
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.021
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1021
00:27:01.021 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 5>they'd just stayed,</v>

1022
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:04.530
<v Speaker 5>it just had become their neighborhood and they just dealt with it.</v>

1023
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.650
<v Speaker 5>And my grandmother was just in a bed all the time,</v>

1024
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.513
<v Speaker 5>moaning.</v>

1025
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:08.890
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1026
00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:10.350
<v Speaker 5>just in agony and pain.</v>

1027
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.480
<v Speaker 5>And one time she says to my grandfather,</v>

1028
00:27:12.481 --> 00:27:14.100
<v Speaker 5>liked you too good to me.</v>

1029
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.390
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1030
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:15.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't deserve you.</v>

1031
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.270
<v Speaker 5>Like she,</v>

1032
00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:16.641
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>

1033
00:27:16.641 --> 00:27:18.510
<v Speaker 5>she was lucid and like she could,</v>

1034
00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:18.891
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1035
00:27:18.891 --> 00:27:19.820
<v Speaker 5>some code talker.</v>

1036
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.450
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes she would say something like that,</v>

1037
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:22.980
<v Speaker 5>but it was really garbled.</v>

1038
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:23.220
<v Speaker 5>I got,</v>

1039
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.080
<v Speaker 5>want to do an impression of it out of respect,</v>

1040
00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:27.000
<v Speaker 5>but it sounded like someone who was pretty fucked up.</v>

1041
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.440
<v Speaker 5>It didn't sound like the way I just said it,</v>

1042
00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:28.561
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1043
00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:29.394
<v Speaker 5>you're too good to me.</v>

1044
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 5>She couldn't talk like that.</v>

1045
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:31.230
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

1046
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.720
<v Speaker 5>it was a long drawn out.</v>

1047
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.820
<v Speaker 5>It was difficult to get the sentence out.</v>

1048
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:36.121
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1049
00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:38.070
<v Speaker 5>He told her he loved her and she was his wife.</v>

1050
00:27:38.071 --> 00:27:38.791
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty crazy.</v>

1051
00:27:38.791 --> 00:27:41.610
<v Speaker 5>It was made me cry and then she died.</v>

1052
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:43.350
<v Speaker 5>It was one of those classic things when she died,</v>

1053
00:27:43.351 --> 00:27:44.280
<v Speaker 5>he died a year later.</v>

1054
00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:44.671
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1055
00:27:44.671 --> 00:27:45.620
<v Speaker 5>My grandparents did that.</v>

1056
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.340
<v Speaker 5>My grandmother is 96,</v>

1057
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.971
<v Speaker 5>96.</v>

1058
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:49.740
<v Speaker 5>They both lived to and uh,</v>

1059
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.510
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1060
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.580
<v Speaker 5>he died and she went right after,</v>

1061
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:54.641
<v Speaker 5>right after.</v>

1062
00:27:54.641 --> 00:27:54.841
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1063
00:27:54.841 --> 00:27:56.610
<v Speaker 5>we'll just went all the way to 96.</v>

1064
00:27:56.611 --> 00:27:57.001
<v Speaker 5>And it was like,</v>

1065
00:27:57.001 --> 00:27:57.990
<v Speaker 5>what else is there?</v>

1066
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.591
<v Speaker 5>There's no,</v>

1067
00:27:58.591 --> 00:27:58.891
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1068
00:27:58.891 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1069
00:27:59.220 --> 00:27:59.581
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1070
00:27:59.581 --> 00:28:00.360
<v Speaker 5>and it's like,</v>

1071
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.680
<v Speaker 5>that's what life was supposed to be.</v>

1072
00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:03.690
<v Speaker 5>It's supposed to be get to a point where it's really,</v>

1073
00:28:03.691 --> 00:28:04.021
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1074
00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:04.291
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1075
00:28:04.291 --> 00:28:06.960
<v Speaker 5>you're accepting the fact that it's over because it's not good anymore.</v>

1076
00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:07.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1077
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.070
<v Speaker 5>You ever read the book?</v>

1078
00:28:08.071 --> 00:28:08.904
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1079
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:09.120
<v Speaker 5>oh.</v>

1080
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.571
<v Speaker 5>What's his name?</v>

1081
00:28:09.571 --> 00:28:11.430
<v Speaker 5>The guy who wrote man's search for meaning?</v>

1082
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:11.991
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1083
00:28:11.991 --> 00:28:12.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm okay.</v>

1084
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:12.860
<v Speaker 5>It's</v>

1085
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:13.181
<v Speaker 4>a guy.</v>

1086
00:28:13.181 --> 00:28:13.380
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1087
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:13.611
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1088
00:28:13.611 --> 00:28:14.030
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1089
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:14.631
<v Speaker 4>victor,</v>

1090
00:28:14.631 --> 00:28:15.464
<v Speaker 4>Victor,</v>

1091
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:16.581
<v Speaker 4>Victor Hugo.</v>

1092
00:28:16.581 --> 00:28:17.600
<v Speaker 4>I think he,</v>

1093
00:28:17.601 --> 00:28:18.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1094
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.710
<v Speaker 4>he was in a concentration camp and he made it all the way through and he wrote</v>

1095
00:28:21.711 --> 00:28:23.630
<v Speaker 4>this book on Low logo therapy,</v>

1096
00:28:23.631 --> 00:28:25.120
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called our logo therapy.</v>

1097
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.233
<v Speaker 4>And he,</v>

1098
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:26.900
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1099
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.080
<v Speaker 4>it was amazing because he talked about all the people that survived and how they</v>

1100
00:28:30.081 --> 00:28:33.560
<v Speaker 4>survived the concentration camp been like stripped completely naked,</v>

1101
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.210
<v Speaker 4>having your hair shaved off your head,</v>

1102
00:28:35.211 --> 00:28:37.100
<v Speaker 4>put in like losing your identity,</v>

1103
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.620
<v Speaker 4>having no identity and being able to survive that,</v>

1104
00:28:39.621 --> 00:28:43.460
<v Speaker 4>like being stripped of everything in life that you ever had and you're having</v>

1105
00:28:43.461 --> 00:28:43.940
<v Speaker 4>your whole,</v>

1106
00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.571
<v Speaker 4>most of these people,</v>

1107
00:28:44.571 --> 00:28:45.800
<v Speaker 4>their whole families were killed,</v>

1108
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:46.663
<v Speaker 4>were murdered.</v>

1109
00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.200
<v Speaker 4>So like what do you live for?</v>

1110
00:28:48.201 --> 00:28:49.280
<v Speaker 4>And I think that happened to him.</v>

1111
00:28:49.281 --> 00:28:50.750
<v Speaker 4>His entire family was killed.</v>

1112
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.090
<v Speaker 4>So some people would still have someone,</v>

1113
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:54.350
<v Speaker 4>they'd be like,</v>

1114
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:58.130
<v Speaker 4>I want to live to get back to my wife or I want to live to get back to my child.</v>

1115
00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.330
<v Speaker 4>His was,</v>

1116
00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.270
<v Speaker 4>I want to live to get back to help people,</v>

1117
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.210
<v Speaker 4>to show people how to get through something this atrocious.</v>

1118
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:05.840
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1119
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.440
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

1120
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.400
<v Speaker 4>That was his will.</v>

1121
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.410
<v Speaker 4>But he said you had to have something.</v>

1122
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.260
<v Speaker 4>If you didn't have something you wouldn't make it.</v>

1123
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:13.650
<v Speaker 4>And he talks about the,</v>

1124
00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:15.860
<v Speaker 4>the most amazing thing he talked about was going,</v>

1125
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1126
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.590
<v Speaker 4>how he said sufferings,</v>

1127
00:29:18.591 --> 00:29:19.520
<v Speaker 4>like a gas.</v>

1128
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.710
<v Speaker 4>It'll fill a room no matter how big it is.</v>

1129
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.630
<v Speaker 4>And he said like,</v>

1130
00:29:23.631 --> 00:29:26.930
<v Speaker 4>they were on the one train going to one of the concentration camps.</v>

1131
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.210
<v Speaker 4>And like if you go over this bridge,</v>

1132
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.300
<v Speaker 4>you were going to the one where they kill you.</v>

1133
00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.550
<v Speaker 4>But if you make like a right turn,</v>

1134
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:38.330
<v Speaker 4>you're going to the one where you're going to stay alive for a couple more</v>

1135
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.331
<v Speaker 4>weeks.</v>

1136
00:29:38.331 --> 00:29:41.770
<v Speaker 4>It's a work camp and they're in the truck and he said like cattle,</v>

1137
00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:41.981
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1138
00:29:41.981 --> 00:29:43.270
<v Speaker 4>they've got them all pressed together.</v>

1139
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.200
<v Speaker 4>You can't breathe your smell like shit and you're smothered and,</v>

1140
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.160
<v Speaker 4>and it's all these other like concentration camp victims and uh,</v>

1141
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:51.970
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1142
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:56.970
<v Speaker 4>you're in there and it's the worst like worse like place you could ever be in</v>

1143
00:29:57.221 --> 00:29:57.820
<v Speaker 4>your life.</v>

1144
00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.420
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1145
00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.141
<v Speaker 4>like mentally,</v>

1146
00:29:59.141 --> 00:30:03.880
<v Speaker 4>physically and you're going over this and you thinking I'm going to die.</v>

1147
00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm going over this bridge and we're going to the death camp.</v>

1148
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:10.450
<v Speaker 4>But they made like a right turn to go to the work camp for two weeks and there</v>

1149
00:30:10.451 --> 00:30:12.640
<v Speaker 4>was like a cheer in,</v>

1150
00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:13.601
<v Speaker 4>in the truck,</v>

1151
00:30:13.601 --> 00:30:14.150
<v Speaker 4>like in the,</v>

1152
00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:14.690
<v Speaker 4>the car,</v>

1153
00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:15.523
<v Speaker 4>the train car.</v>

1154
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:20.910
<v Speaker 4>That was like the greatest feeling in the world because they had two more weeks</v>

1155
00:30:21.101 --> 00:30:21.491
<v Speaker 4>to live.</v>

00:30:32.581 --> 00:30:34.780
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of Buddhist about like live in the moment.</v>

1163
00:30:34.781 --> 00:30:35.230

<v Speaker 4>but you can have these levels of like,</v>

1173
00:30:47.951 --> 00:30:48.910

1174
00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:50.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.760
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking amazing book.</v>

1176
00:30:51.761 --> 00:30:52.594
<v Speaker 4>It's Eh,</v>

1177
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:53.350
<v Speaker 4>is it,</v>

1178
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.111
<v Speaker 4>did you look it up?</v>

1179
00:30:54.111 --> 00:30:55.030
<v Speaker 4>Is it Victor Hugo?</v>

1180
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.230
<v Speaker 4>You know victor,</v>

1181
00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.071
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1182
00:30:57.071 --> 00:30:57.880
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember his name.</v>

1183
00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.380
<v Speaker 4>It's called man's search for meaning.</v>

1184
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:00.390
<v Speaker 4>It's an old book.</v>

1185
00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:01.280
<v Speaker 5>That famous book.</v>

1186
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.440
<v Speaker 5>It is a weird question when you try to figure out like what were,</v>

1187
00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.390
<v Speaker 5>what are you here for?</v>

1188
00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.021
<v Speaker 5>Like what is,</v>

1189
00:31:06.021 --> 00:31:07.040
<v Speaker 5>what is meaning,</v>

1190
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1191
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:08.360
<v Speaker 5>if it is,</v>

1192
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:08.760
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

1193
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:13.310
<v Speaker 5>the human mind looks at the future and figures out that this is a certain amount</v>

1194
00:31:13.311 --> 00:31:15.500
<v Speaker 5>of time left is only a certain amount of time left.</v>

1195
00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:19.140
<v Speaker 5>If you're to believe that this world is real and all,</v>

1196
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.710
<v Speaker 5>you really have a finite time as you,</v>

1197
00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.330
<v Speaker 5>if you believe this world is real.</v>

1198
00:31:23.331 --> 00:31:24.111
<v Speaker 5>It's funny you say that,</v>

1199
00:31:24.111 --> 00:31:24.680
<v Speaker 5>cause I,</v>

1200
00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.200
<v Speaker 4>I had lunch with my sister the other day who's very intelligent.</v>

1201
00:31:27.201 --> 00:31:30.950
<v Speaker 4>She's a partner in like the biggest law firm and we started talking about it and</v>

1202
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:32.060
<v Speaker 4>we disagree on a lot.</v>

1203
00:31:32.061 --> 00:31:32.211
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1204
00:31:32.211 --> 00:31:32.841
<v Speaker 4>she's actually,</v>

1205
00:31:32.841 --> 00:31:35.150
<v Speaker 4>she still believes in God and all this stuff.</v>

1206
00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:38.450
<v Speaker 4>And I said something about if you believe this world is real,</v>

1207
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.130
<v Speaker 4>and she kind of gave the Descartes,</v>

1208
00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:40.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1209
00:31:40.731 --> 00:31:41.990
<v Speaker 4>I think therefore I am.</v>

1210
00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.390
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like even how does he know?</v>

1211
00:31:44.391 --> 00:31:45.920
<v Speaker 4>He was fucking thinking.</v>

1212
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:46.221
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1213
00:31:46.221 --> 00:31:46.830
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

1214
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:51.690
<v Speaker 5>how does he know when it becomes entirely more possible as technology increases</v>

1215
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:56.340
<v Speaker 5>to envision a world some point in the future where it's going to be possible to</v>

1216
00:31:56.341 --> 00:31:59.280
<v Speaker 5>recreate reality in an indistinguishable form.</v>

1217
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.290
<v Speaker 5>And it may have already happened.</v>

1218
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.880
<v Speaker 5>We may be in it right now.</v>

1219
00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.900
<v Speaker 5>And then maybe one of the reasons why life is so ridiculous is because sometimes</v>

1220
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:08.190
<v Speaker 5>like in a lot of movies,</v>

1221
00:32:08.191 --> 00:32:09.270
<v Speaker 5>there's some shitty writing.</v>

1222
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:14.430
<v Speaker 5>And then this is a dude named wiener who likes to pull his dick out and show it</v>

1223
00:32:14.431 --> 00:32:15.360
<v Speaker 5>to girls on the Internet.</v>

1224
00:32:15.361 --> 00:32:16.920
<v Speaker 5>He just happens to be a senator,</v>

1225
00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:17.850
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1226
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:18.930
<v Speaker 5>or John Edwards,</v>

1227
00:32:18.931 --> 00:32:19.310
<v Speaker 5>he's what?</v>

1228
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.471
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

1229
00:32:19.471 --> 00:32:20.430
<v Speaker 5>Your wife's got cancer,</v>

1230
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:21.780
<v Speaker 5>why don't you go fuck another chicken?</v>

1231
00:32:21.781 --> 00:32:22.680
<v Speaker 5>Should a load inside of her.</v>

1232
00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.660
<v Speaker 5>That'd be good for your presidential aspirations.</v>

1233
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.180
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1234
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:25.621
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

1235
00:32:25.621 --> 00:32:27.330
<v Speaker 5>this is a real John Edwards,</v>

1236
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.310
<v Speaker 5>not only that he's on trial right now,</v>

1237
00:32:29.311 --> 00:32:30.900
<v Speaker 5>but following his trial,</v>

1238
00:32:30.901 --> 00:32:32.100
<v Speaker 5>they want to put that guy in jail.</v>

1239
00:32:32.101 --> 00:32:33.480
<v Speaker 5>He almost became the president.</v>

1240
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.070
<v Speaker 5>He was a real,</v>

1241
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.083
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1242
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:38.680
<v Speaker 5>he had a real good shot at being the vice president with [inaudible].</v>

1243
00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 5>It look like the all American</v>

1244
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.530
<v Speaker 2>piano.</v>

1245
00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:41.750
<v Speaker 2>He's a liberal,</v>

1246
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 2>he's an intelligent guy.</v>

1247
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:44.270
<v Speaker 2>He's a lawyer,</v>

1248
00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking looks great.</v>

1249
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.880
<v Speaker 2>But he fucked around.</v>

1250
00:32:47.881 --> 00:32:48.440
<v Speaker 2>But he was,</v>

1251
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.610
<v Speaker 2>he was bagging this camera woman tripped over on its own deck and yeah,</v>

1252
00:32:52.611 --> 00:32:53.750
<v Speaker 2>and they're there.</v>

1253
00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Apparently what happened wasn't just that,</v>

1254
00:32:55.731 --> 00:32:56.870
<v Speaker 2>that's not why he's in trouble.</v>

1255
00:32:56.871 --> 00:33:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Why he's in trouble is because of his campaign finances.</v>

1256
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.930
<v Speaker 2>He apparently use some of the money to finance her living and him hiding her.</v>

1257
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:07.400
<v Speaker 2>So that's what he's,</v>

1258
00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:08.930
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

1259
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.220
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1260
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.940
<v Speaker 2>As has as scandalous or not scandalous,</v>

1261
00:33:13.941 --> 00:33:17.570
<v Speaker 2>but as corrupt as campaign financing is that they'll go after him.</v>

1262
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.111
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1263
00:33:18.111 --> 00:33:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I think they want to go and after a guy for stealing money from a drug dealer,</v>

1264
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.220
<v Speaker 2>like right.</v>

1265
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.640
<v Speaker 2>That's fun.</v>

1266
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.121
<v Speaker 2>The money.</v>

1267
00:33:26.121 --> 00:33:28.580
<v Speaker 2>So shitty in campaign financing,</v>

1268
00:33:28.581 --> 00:33:30.590
<v Speaker 2>the way it's coming in and how illegal and how,</v>

1269
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.380
<v Speaker 2>how all these corporations are financing campaigns.</v>

1270
00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:34.280
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

1271
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.630
<v Speaker 2>it's the fundamental problem with American.</v>

1272
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:37.031
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

1273
00:33:37.031 --> 00:33:37.460
<v Speaker 2>But in the,</v>

1274
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.480
<v Speaker 2>in this instance,</v>

1275
00:33:38.481 --> 00:33:39.350
<v Speaker 2>one of the state,</v>

1276
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.820
<v Speaker 2>one of the things about it is this to very specific wealthy donors that he had</v>

1277
00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:44.654
<v Speaker 2>courted.</v>

1278
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:48.770
<v Speaker 2>And so it was really like he bribed them of my day yet he knew that his campaign</v>

1279
00:33:48.771 --> 00:33:51.690
<v Speaker 2>was going to fall apart because he knew that I was getting,</v>

1280
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:52.551
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>

1281
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 2>but those fuckers are buying influence.</v>

1282
00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.120
<v Speaker 2>So that's what you get.</v>

1283
00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:56.240
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1284
00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:56.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1285
00:33:56.631 --> 00:33:59.330
<v Speaker 2>you're maybe one of them was a wealthy individuals.</v>

1286
00:33:59.331 --> 00:34:00.164
<v Speaker 2>A woman.</v>

1287
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1288
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:04.720
<v Speaker 2>But like if you saw the guy that was financing new to campaign or Santorum's</v>

1289
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:05.563
<v Speaker 2>campaign,</v>

1290
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:09.230
<v Speaker 2>these are just EGOMANIAC fucking rich people.</v>

1291
00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:09.831
<v Speaker 2>Super,</v>

1292
00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:10.461
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>

1293
00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:12.070
<v Speaker 2>super rich that,</v>

1294
00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.780
<v Speaker 2>that have done everything and it's on their bucket list.</v>

1295
00:34:14.781 --> 00:34:16.370
<v Speaker 2>And then they also have ideals like,</v>

1296
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:16.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1297
00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:18.320
<v Speaker 2>I think the world should be run like this.</v>

1298
00:34:18.321 --> 00:34:19.910
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to put money in the pocket of a,</v>

1299
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:21.140
<v Speaker 2>of a politician,</v>

1300
00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:21.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1303
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.190
<v Speaker 2>they're buying influence politicians.</v>

1305
00:34:29.631 --> 00:34:30.464
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence Lessig,</v>

1306
00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.180
<v Speaker 2>a republic lost and I've felt this way for years cause I,</v>

1307
00:34:34.181 --> 00:34:37.190
<v Speaker 2>I traveled all over the world doing comedy in every country I went to,</v>

1308
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.960
<v Speaker 2>everybody yelled at me about America,</v>

1309
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.780
<v Speaker 2>like every single green room of every comedy club.</v>

1310
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:43.010
<v Speaker 2>No matter where I went,</v>

1311
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.550
<v Speaker 2>it was like I was the representative for America and everybody wanted to fucking</v>

1315
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:52.870

<v Speaker 1>not in.</v>

1382
00:36:33.001 --> 00:36:35.530
<v Speaker 1>So you did this on purpose and then would you go up and just,</v>

1383
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.633
<v Speaker 1>I would do it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1388
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.480
<v Speaker 4>In the beginning I would apologize,</v>

1389
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.880
<v Speaker 4>like when I first started going to England and all over the world,</v>

1390
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:42.571
<v Speaker 4>I would apologize.</v>

1391
00:36:42.571 --> 00:36:44.040
<v Speaker 4>And then I got to the point where I'm like,</v>

1392
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.440
<v Speaker 4>I knew where I could stand.</v>

1393
00:36:46.441 --> 00:36:46.980
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

1394
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.880
<v Speaker 4>and I liked that.</v>

1395
00:36:47.881 --> 00:36:49.110
<v Speaker 4>I just wrote them in on it.</v>

1396
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:49.720
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1397
00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:49.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1398
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.970
<v Speaker 4>you just booed me now.</v>

1399
00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:51.600
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1400
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.040
<v Speaker 4>now I'm able to come after you.</v>

1401
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.260
<v Speaker 4>Because it was funny like I was,</v>

1402
00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:57.300
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't doing well over there when I would be like,</v>

1403
00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:57.661
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1404
00:36:57.661 --> 00:36:58.351
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1405
00:36:58.351 --> 00:36:58.780
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1406
00:36:58.780 --> 00:36:59.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1407
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.330
<v Speaker 4>But when I'd be like,</v>

1408
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:00.781
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

1409
00:37:00.781 --> 00:37:01.440
<v Speaker 4>You know who,</v>

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.200
<v Speaker 4>How are you pointing the finger at us when you're fucking right?</v>

1413
00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.211
<v Speaker 1>But even that,</v>

1414
00:37:07.211 --> 00:37:07.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1415
00:37:07.421 --> 00:37:08.740
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about we're really,</v>

1416
00:37:08.741 --> 00:37:09.220

<v Speaker 1>you think AAA age doesn't work for the alliance deal?</v>

1418
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:14.051
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>

1419
00:37:14.051 --> 00:37:15.520
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking nonsense,</v>

1420
00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1421
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.201
<v Speaker 1>even saying that,</v>

1422
00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck they're doing.</v>

1423
00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what they're doing?</v>

1424
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:20.201
<v Speaker 1>Who's allies?</v>

1425
00:37:20.201 --> 00:37:21.034
<v Speaker 1>What does that even mean?</v>

1426
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.890
<v Speaker 1>What's evolved in this alliance where the lines,</v>

1427
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.590
<v Speaker 1>cheese,</v>

1428
00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I just was watching yesterday,</v>

1429
00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.660
<v Speaker 1>they're saying Pakistan and Afghanistan are about,</v>

1430
00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:29.900
<v Speaker 1>they might go to war with,</v>

1431
00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:30.581
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1432
00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:32.830
<v Speaker 1>there was a theory that someone said to me,</v>

1433
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:32.891
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1434
00:37:32.891 --> 00:37:35.170
<v Speaker 1>it was Duncan Duncan Trussell said there's a theory.</v>

1435
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was quoting it,</v>

1436
00:37:36.551 --> 00:37:41.110
<v Speaker 1>but the what it was was that the idea is that as the world falls apart,</v>

1437
00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:44.260
<v Speaker 1>really it's your own reality that's falling apart.</v>

1438
00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.700
<v Speaker 1>It's just the reality of the world is that it's really a piece of your</v>

1439
00:37:48.701 --> 00:37:53.020
<v Speaker 1>imagination and that as the world gets more and more chaotic and we move closer</v>

1440
00:37:53.021 --> 00:37:56.250
<v Speaker 1>to the end of the Mayan calendar and there's nuclear wars,</v>

1441
00:37:56.290 --> 00:38:00.190
<v Speaker 1>a threatened about what all that really is Fukushima's meltdown the pollution in</v>

1442
00:38:00.191 --> 00:38:01.024
<v Speaker 1>the oceans.</v>

1443
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:06.030
<v Speaker 1>It is really your own reality of your temporary existence in this plane is</v>

1444
00:38:06.161 --> 00:38:06.994
<v Speaker 1>coming to an end.</v>

1445
00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I believe that to sort of maybe,</v>

1446
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:11.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what we were talking about earlier when we're talking about like</v>

1447
00:38:11.531 --> 00:38:13.510
<v Speaker 1>whether or not life really is a work of fiction.</v>

1448
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1449
00:38:14.051 --> 00:38:15.310
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that I believe it,</v>

1450
00:38:15.311 --> 00:38:16.390
<v Speaker 1>but I don't not believe that.</v>

1451
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:17.981
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said,</v>

1452
00:38:17.981 --> 00:38:19.890
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know what I know I've,</v>

1453
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1454
00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:20.901
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

1455
00:38:20.901 --> 00:38:23.380
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot of shit about these crazy,</v>

1456
00:38:23.381 --> 00:38:26.620
<v Speaker 1>what if scenarios where you stop and think about it and you're like,</v>

1457
00:38:26.621 --> 00:38:27.910
<v Speaker 1>what if this and what if,</v>

1458
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.863
<v Speaker 1>what if this is a,</v>

1459
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.770
<v Speaker 1>this is artificial,</v>

1460
00:38:29.771 --> 00:38:31.510
<v Speaker 1>but at a certain point in time,</v>

1461
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.340
<v Speaker 1>we know that's going to happen.</v>

1462
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 1>If you look at like what you now what,</v>

1463
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.540
<v Speaker 2>just look at this,</v>

1464
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.160
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I can get on this laptop and I can just watch movies and I can</v>

1465
00:38:42.161 --> 00:38:42.271
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1466
00:38:42.271 --> 00:38:44.900
<v Speaker 2>and interact with people and exchange information and,</v>

1467
00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.460
<v Speaker 2>and the graphics are incredible and the photos are high definition.</v>

1468
00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:53.610
<v Speaker 2>This is just one step in a process that is not going to stop unless resources</v>

1469
00:38:53.861 --> 00:38:54.310
<v Speaker 2>run out.</v>

1470
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:56.830
<v Speaker 2>And we all wind up being fucking zombies and cannibals.</v>

1471
00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:57.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1472
00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:01.150
<v Speaker 2>it was really the only way civilization is going to have to fall apart for us to</v>

1473
00:39:01.151 --> 00:39:04.630
<v Speaker 2>lose our obsession with the direction that technology is moving.</v>

1474
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:06.160
<v Speaker 2>There's never gonna be a time when we go,</v>

1475
00:39:06.161 --> 00:39:06.910
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1476
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:08.380
<v Speaker 2>We have enough technology.</v>

1477
00:39:08.381 --> 00:39:09.310
<v Speaker 2>We're cool with this.</v>

1478
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Well we have to do is clean up our mess.</v>

1479
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:11.883
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1480
00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:16.090
<v Speaker 2>but there also could be the chance of a solar flare or something that just wipes</v>

1481
00:39:16.091 --> 00:39:20.440
<v Speaker 2>it all out where then the earth starts over again like an ice age or something</v>

1482
00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:24.790
<v Speaker 2>where we start from ground one again where we start super possible and then you</v>

1483
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:28.240
<v Speaker 2>and you think about if we evolve from or not if we have all,</v>

1484
00:39:28.241 --> 00:39:31.360
<v Speaker 2>but as we evolved from apes or were apes camp originally,</v>

1485
00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:35.860
<v Speaker 2>what they came from and that whole millions and millions of year process that</v>

1486
00:39:35.861 --> 00:39:39.540
<v Speaker 2>has to start all over again and they might not get like,</v>

1487
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.410
<v Speaker 2>we don't even know it.</v>

1488
00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:45.640
<v Speaker 2>How do we even know if we have gotten the the furthest along?</v>

1489
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:45.851
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1490
00:39:45.851 --> 00:39:46.870
<v Speaker 2>it's really fucked up man.</v>

1491
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:49.600
<v Speaker 2>When you look at those pictures of like what we evolved from,</v>

1492
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:50.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1493
00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll steal your pithy kiss and all these dudes that live like a million years</v>

1494
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:54.460
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1495
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.570
<v Speaker 2>That's not that long ago.</v>

1496
00:39:56.350 --> 00:40:00.730
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that it go from a million years to today and look how much</v>

1497
00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:01.091
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

1498
00:40:01.091 --> 00:40:05.560
<v Speaker 2>we looked at every other ape like one ape started standing up,</v>

1499
00:40:05.561 --> 00:40:06.161
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

1500
00:40:06.161 --> 00:40:07.210
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't just one of us.</v>

1501
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:08.380
<v Speaker 2>There was a gang of us,</v>

1502
00:40:08.381 --> 00:40:09.250
<v Speaker 2>different species,</v>

1503
00:40:09.251 --> 00:40:11.620
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them that never made it like the Flores,</v>

1504
00:40:11.621 --> 00:40:15.970
<v Speaker 2>the hobbit man that they found recently that has recently as I think it was</v>

1505
00:40:15.971 --> 00:40:17.230
<v Speaker 2>10,000 years ago,</v>

1506
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.780
<v Speaker 2>they were living coinciding with human beings.</v>

1507
00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:20.620
<v Speaker 2>What's the hobbit?</v>

1508
00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:21.730
<v Speaker 2>The little hobbit people,</v>

1509
00:40:21.731 --> 00:40:22.690
<v Speaker 2>a little tiny people,</v>

1510
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.810
<v Speaker 2>a tiny race of human beings on an island.</v>

1511
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.820
<v Speaker 2>Are they are,</v>

1512
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.800
<v Speaker 2>they may be like a complete set.</v>

1513
00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:29.980
<v Speaker 2>What's the wharves are today?</v>

1514
00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:30.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1515
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.271
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1516
00:40:30.271 --> 00:40:30.400
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1517
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:30.810
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>

1518
00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:32.080
<v Speaker 2>there are tiny people there.</v>

1519
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:33.070
<v Speaker 2>They're in proportion.</v>

1520
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.150
<v Speaker 2>A dwarf is,</v>

1521
00:40:34.151 --> 00:40:37.540
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that it's a genetic anomaly in their body of they have short arms</v>

1522
00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.130
<v Speaker 2>and a large head.</v>

1523
00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.760
<v Speaker 2>We had on talking shit my pockets with the other day we had a,</v>

1524
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:43.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it's door.</v>

1525
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.661
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1526
00:40:43.661 --> 00:40:44.441
<v Speaker 2>midgets would,</v>

1527
00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:44.591
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1528
00:40:44.591 --> 00:40:46.160
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to say that.</v>

1529
00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:46.811
<v Speaker 2>They explained it.</v>

1530
00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:47.230
<v Speaker 2>We had,</v>

1531
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.063
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

1532
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:49.490
<v Speaker 2>I had as our guests,</v>

1533
00:40:49.491 --> 00:40:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I had three dorms.</v>

1534
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.830
<v Speaker 2>I know it was a dwarf it proportionate person who's very tiny.</v>

1535
00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:54.430
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1536
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Which one is the proportionate?</v>

1537
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:55.940
<v Speaker 2>It's rare.</v>

1538
00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:00.400
<v Speaker 2>So many different types of it that they were explaining all their types,</v>

1539
00:41:00.401 --> 00:41:01.280
<v Speaker 2>like a tenure,</v>

1540
00:41:01.281 --> 00:41:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Lee Davis and a nickname Nicky and Brad Williams were all in the show and they</v>

1541
00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:06.760
<v Speaker 2>were all explaining that they all had,</v>

1542
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.940
<v Speaker 2>I think the three of them had three different types of dwarfism.</v>

1543
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:13.720
<v Speaker 2>And then they talked about if they were to have sex and have a child,</v>

1544
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:18.490
<v Speaker 2>like there's a 25% chance that it could acquire like that.</v>

1545
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:20.770
<v Speaker 2>And they know all this because they go to like the little people of America</v>

1546
00:41:20.771 --> 00:41:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Convention,</v>

1547
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.720
<v Speaker 2>which I went to this year,</v>

1548
00:41:22.721 --> 00:41:24.160
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking amazing.</v>

1549
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.233
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1550
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.460
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

1551
00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 2>they study all this stuff and they know like they've,</v>

1552
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 2>I think they've isolated the gene that causes it causes and</v>

1553
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:34.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1554
00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:38.060
<v Speaker 3>they know what it is and they threw like gene therapy and every,</v>

1555
00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:39.220
<v Speaker 3>not gene therapy or we'll,</v>

1556
00:41:39.221 --> 00:41:39.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1557
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:40.071
<v Speaker 3>whatever they do,</v>

1558
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:40.940
<v Speaker 3>like stem cell or whatever,</v>

1559
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.320
<v Speaker 3>they might be able to prevent it from happening in the future and reverse it.</v>

1560
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:45.981
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1561
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:46.731
<v Speaker 3>they can't reverse it,</v>

1562
00:41:46.731 --> 00:41:48.470
<v Speaker 3>but they might be able to prevent it from happening.</v>

1563
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.340
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of doors were upset about this saying like,</v>

1564
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.720
<v Speaker 3>you're going to kill our spaces.</v>

1565
00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.593
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1566
00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:55.720
<v Speaker 3>It make them wrong.</v>

1567
00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:58.640
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to just modify the gene to make it like a sexy doors.</v>

1568
00:41:58.641 --> 00:41:59.840
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think if they did it right,</v>

1569
00:41:59.841 --> 00:42:00.674
<v Speaker 3>it would be cool.</v>

1570
00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:02.533
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1571
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:04.430
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend in Australia,</v>

1572
00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:04.791
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

1573
00:42:04.791 --> 00:42:05.240
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1574
00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:05.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1575
00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:10.590
<v Speaker 3>he Monae who is 41 pounds and he's full grown and he is the smallest manual</v>

1576
00:42:11.811 --> 00:42:12.081
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

1577
00:42:12.081 --> 00:42:12.680
<v Speaker 3>See.</v>

1578
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:16.850
<v Speaker 3>And he's a standup comedian and he is fucking tiny.</v>

1579
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.931
<v Speaker 3>And he is a thing,</v>

1580
00:42:17.931 --> 00:42:19.580
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called Rhema disorder if I'm,</v>

1581
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.473
<v Speaker 3>if I'm right.</v>

1582
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 3>And the only other person in the world that has it,</v>

1583
00:42:22.341 --> 00:42:24.350
<v Speaker 3>it is his sister and her name's Rema.</v>

1584
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:25.700
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1585
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.640
<v Speaker 3>he just looks like a miniature person.</v>

1586
00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Everything's proportionate,</v>

1587
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.753
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

1588
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.130
<v Speaker 3>even his cock and uh,</v>

1589
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:34.880
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1590
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.900
<v Speaker 3>he claims it's big.</v>

1591
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:36.743
<v Speaker 3>Jose.</v>

1592
00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:38.810
<v Speaker 3>He's a back pedal toughie.</v>

1593
00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:39.980
<v Speaker 3>I would say</v>

1594
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.010
<v Speaker 3>he's t's,</v>

1595
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.240
<v Speaker 3>he's about up to your thigh,</v>

1596
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.470
<v Speaker 3>midway up your thigh.</v>

1597
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:46.873
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1598
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:47.601
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

1599
00:42:47.601 --> 00:42:47.961
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1600
00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:49.100
<v Speaker 3>he's tiny.</v>

1601
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.180
<v Speaker 3>He's a funny comedian.</v>

1602
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Really funny.</v>

1603
00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:51.853
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1604
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.851
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>

1605
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:54.080
<v Speaker 3>And I've gotten them wasted,</v>

1606
00:42:54.081 --> 00:42:54.830
<v Speaker 3>which is fun.</v>

1607
00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

1608
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:56.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm asking you to drink,</v>

1609
00:42:56.391 --> 00:42:57.650
<v Speaker 3>he had wine one wine cooler.</v>

1610
00:42:57.651 --> 00:42:58.484
<v Speaker 3>He smokes pot,</v>

1611
00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.000
<v Speaker 3>like of what I've seen like a fiend and drinks,</v>

1612
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.320
<v Speaker 3>like I saw him one night,</v>

1613
00:43:03.321 --> 00:43:07.220
<v Speaker 3>probably have six gin and tonics and I was,</v>

1614
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.480
<v Speaker 3>he's got long hair too,</v>

1615
00:43:08.481 --> 00:43:09.800
<v Speaker 3>which is funky.</v>

1616
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:14.440
<v Speaker 3>And I had to hold his hair because he was puking and I ended up class.</v>

1617
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:17.570
<v Speaker 3>I ended up carrying him about 20 blocks home,</v>

1618
00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.053
<v Speaker 3>like red,</v>

1619
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.450
<v Speaker 3>like a baby.</v>

1620
00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Like I had to carry him in my arms</v>

1621
00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:26.531
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>

1622
00:43:26.531 --> 00:43:27.170
<v Speaker 3>I had them on budget,</v>

1623
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:27.950
<v Speaker 3>like a sandbag.</v>

1624
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Did you get them in a gable grip?</v>

1625
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:32.270
<v Speaker 3>First item on my shoulder,</v>

1626
00:43:32.271 --> 00:43:33.000
<v Speaker 3>like a parrot.</v>

1627
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Do you get them in the Guillotine group?</v>

1628
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:35.600
<v Speaker 3>It's an odd group.</v>

1629
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:39.230
<v Speaker 3>This to palm outward and the other one inward.</v>

1630
00:43:39.231 --> 00:43:40.230
<v Speaker 3>It's really good for kids,</v>

1631
00:43:40.231 --> 00:43:40.940
<v Speaker 3>teens.</v>

1632
00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:41.570
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1633
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:43.820
<v Speaker 3>and then I just took it back to my house and uh,</v>

1634
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.370
<v Speaker 3>and I let him pass out on my couch because,</v>

1635
00:43:46.371 --> 00:43:46.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1636
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:49.040
<v Speaker 3>he was just so fucked up and he would add to get home.</v>

1637
00:43:49.041 --> 00:43:49.874
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1638
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:50.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1639
00:43:50.211 --> 00:43:53.400
<v Speaker 3>you don't want like a stumbling door for walking around the street.</v>

1640
00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:53.750
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

1641
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.430
<v Speaker 3>he technically is not a door frame.</v>

1642
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:57.350
<v Speaker 3>He has this thing called Rhema disorder,</v>

1643
00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.390
<v Speaker 3>but what does what what I'm getting at,</v>

1644
00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.120
<v Speaker 3>they don't like the word [inaudible] the word midget,</v>

1645
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:05.090
<v Speaker 3>but he used to be that there was like midgets and dwarves and there were two</v>

1646
00:44:05.091 --> 00:44:07.790
<v Speaker 3>different Midge Midge it comes from the word image or something,</v>

1647
00:44:07.791 --> 00:44:08.750
<v Speaker 3>which is an insect.</v>

1648
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.500
<v Speaker 3>So you're calling them an insect and they also don't like it because their whole</v>

1649
00:44:12.501 --> 00:44:13.334
<v Speaker 3>lives,</v>

1650
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.770
<v Speaker 3>they've been identified as look at the midget.</v>

1651
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.260
<v Speaker 3>And so it's not like,</v>

1652
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:22.370
<v Speaker 3>it's just seems so weird that the name change is going to change anything,</v>

1653
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.031
<v Speaker 3>isn't it really?</v>

1654
00:44:23.031 --> 00:44:24.950
<v Speaker 3>The intent with you know mean I agree,</v>

1655
00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:25.784
<v Speaker 3>but I think,</v>

1656
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.440
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like when you look at,</v>

1657
00:44:27.441 --> 00:44:29.150
<v Speaker 3>like when I said like cracker,</v>

1658
00:44:29.151 --> 00:44:30.830
<v Speaker 3>the word cracker doesn't hurt anyone.</v>

1659
00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's ever gone.</v>

1660
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:33.290
<v Speaker 2>That upsets and I'm,</v>

1661
00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm one for like I say on stage,</v>

1662
00:44:35.011 --> 00:44:37.440
<v Speaker 2>I say absolutely every word I can possibly think of.</v>

1663
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:39.030
<v Speaker 2>I have a joke about him.</v>

1664
00:44:39.031 --> 00:44:39.211
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1665
00:44:39.211 --> 00:44:40.160
<v Speaker 2>my best friends is a,</v>

1666
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:41.041
<v Speaker 2>is a midget,</v>

1667
00:44:41.041 --> 00:44:43.590
<v Speaker 2>he's a real life du Du du Lu and he hates the word midget.</v>

1668
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:44.190
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1669
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:47.370
<v Speaker 2>he says that's the most offensive thing you can call a little person.</v>

1670
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:47.941
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1671
00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:49.140
<v Speaker 2>what about Nigger midget?</v>

1672
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:50.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>

1673
00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:54.870
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot more because it's not like your people are enslaved except in the</v>

1674
00:44:54.871 --> 00:44:55.704
<v Speaker 2>wizard of Oz.</v>

1675
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.110
<v Speaker 2>But they like,</v>

1676
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I understand where they're coming from that their whole life because I've been</v>

1677
00:45:02.341 --> 00:45:04.860
<v Speaker 2>with and I feel like you've got to just give it to them just because they've got</v>

1678
00:45:04.861 --> 00:45:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Delta shitty hand.</v>

1679
00:45:05.701 --> 00:45:08.130
<v Speaker 2>If that's going to make you happier that we won't say major that I won't say</v>

1680
00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:08.973
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1681
00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:09.973
<v Speaker 2>I've walked home,</v>

1682
00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I've walked down the street with them and it's amazing.</v>

1683
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're with a black person,</v>

1684
00:45:14.491 --> 00:45:16.920
<v Speaker 2>people aren't pointing it this day and age,</v>

1685
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:17.491
<v Speaker 2>yelling,</v>

1686
00:45:17.491 --> 00:45:18.420
<v Speaker 2>look at the n word,</v>

1687
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:20.460
<v Speaker 2>but when you're with a little person,</v>

1688
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.130
<v Speaker 2>people fucking point and yell.</v>

1689
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Do you watch game of Thrones?</v>

1690
00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:24.780
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1691
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's telling me I have to go one little dude who's on the,</v>

1692
00:45:27.481 --> 00:45:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know his name.</v>

1693
00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:30.000
<v Speaker 2>I should probably look at the purpose.</v>

1694
00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:30.841
<v Speaker 2>Fucking brilliant.</v>

1695

<v Speaker 2>And he steals the show that got shows.</v>

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:19.430
<v Speaker 3>just like one of those inflatable pools,</v>

1780
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:21.920
<v Speaker 3>The bottom of the pool was just on cement.</v>

1781
00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:23.840
<v Speaker 3>So they're wrestling on,</v>

1782
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:25.890
<v Speaker 3>on a piece of nylon over cement.</v>

1783
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:26.211

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:38.620
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm going in next and the girls are taunting me and they're going,</v>

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.790
<v Speaker 2>So the girls are fucking beating the fuck out of me.</v>

1798
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Beating the fuck.</v>

1799
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Like I had scratches and blood coming like,</v>

1800
00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:54.760
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going calm the fuck down.</v>

1801
00:47:54.761 --> 00:47:54.911
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1802
00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:55.780
<v Speaker 2>this is a show,</v>

1803
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.673
<v Speaker 2>not like,</v>

1804
00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:57.460
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1805
00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.510
<v Speaker 2>and they're gouging it,</v>

1806
00:47:58.511 --> 00:47:59.110
<v Speaker 2>me and all that.</v>

1807
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:00.220
<v Speaker 2>So finally I just was like,</v>

1808
00:48:00.221 --> 00:48:00.521
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1809
00:48:00.521 --> 00:48:00.881
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1810
00:48:00.881 --> 00:48:01.330
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>

1811
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:01.901
<v Speaker 2>what can I do?</v>

1812
00:48:01.901 --> 00:48:03.910
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking hurt them.</v>

1813
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.860
<v Speaker 2>So I just started like pulling off their,</v>

1814
00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:06.310
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

1815
00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:08.020
<v Speaker 2>their bikini tops and bottoms.</v>

1816
00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:08.831
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1817
00:48:08.831 --> 00:48:11.740
<v Speaker 2>at least that's where there'll become defensive.</v>

1818
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:14.350
<v Speaker 2>So if I just start showing their titties to everybody,</v>

1819
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:15.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1820
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.641
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1821
00:48:15.641 --> 00:48:17.200
<v Speaker 2>when I look like the good guy,</v>

1822
00:48:17.201 --> 00:48:19.870
<v Speaker 2>the crowd likes me and sure enough,</v>

1823
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.823

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.870
<v Speaker 2>I accidentally fingered one of them.</v>

1825
00:48:22.871 --> 00:48:23.704
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

1826
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.910

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't like me when I get mad.</v>

1865
00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:27.940

1866
00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:28.980
<v Speaker 2>it's that sounded like the hulk.</v>

1867
00:49:28.981 --> 00:49:29.970
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't like me when I'm angry.</v>

1868
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get a physical vehicle.</v>

1869
00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:37.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to ever put myself in a position where I'm physical with a check at</v>

1870
00:49:37.081 --> 00:49:37.914
<v Speaker 2>all like that.</v>

1871
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Me Neither.</v>

1872
00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:39.870
<v Speaker 2>And I like in high school,</v>

1873
00:49:39.871 --> 00:49:40.770
<v Speaker 2>one time I had a girl,</v>

1874
00:49:40.771 --> 00:49:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I beat up her brother and uh,</v>

1875
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.130
<v Speaker 2>luckily he's a fair fight kind of thing.</v>

1876
00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I beat him up.</v>

1877
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:45.660
<v Speaker 2>We need a fist fight.</v>

1878
00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:47.610
<v Speaker 2>I won and she was older,</v>

1879
00:49:47.611 --> 00:49:50.580
<v Speaker 2>like two years older and she was like the biggest burnout,</v>

1880
00:49:50.581 --> 00:49:54.390
<v Speaker 2>fucking hardcore like crazy bitch in the school and everybody's like,</v>

1881
00:49:54.391 --> 00:49:55.140
<v Speaker 2>you're dead.</v>

1882
00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.590
<v Speaker 2>She came to get me and she beat me up in front of the whole high school.</v>

1883
00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Like she was just slapping me in the face and punched and I just had to sit</v>

1884
00:50:01.561 --> 00:50:05.550
<v Speaker 2>there and take it and I just sat there and just took every po like,</v>

1885
00:50:05.551 --> 00:50:05.940
<v Speaker 2>and just,</v>

1886
00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.130
<v Speaker 2>I just kept calling her a con.</v>

1887
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.100
<v Speaker 2>There's a woman,</v>

1888
00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:13.260
<v Speaker 2>there's this woman who was a lesbian and she was also a like a really high level</v>

1889
00:50:13.261 --> 00:50:14.360
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo players.</v>

1890
00:50:14.361 --> 00:50:14.940
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>

1891
00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:17.880
<v Speaker 2>she had fought in a lot of national tournament's placed.</v>

1892
00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:18.600
<v Speaker 2>She had been,</v>

1893
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.260
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

1894
00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.100
<v Speaker 2>she was very good.</v>

1895
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.150
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1896
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:25.200
<v Speaker 2>she was a in the class and she had this hard on from men.</v>

1897
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 2>Like she would especially that weren't as good as her.</v>

1898
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.290
<v Speaker 5>She would beat the fuck out of that.</v>

1899
00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:31.250
<v Speaker 5>She would be,</v>

1900
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:32.360
<v Speaker 5>she'd beat the fuck out of Steve.</v>

1901
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.571
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1902
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:33.350
<v Speaker 5>Steve Graham,</v>

1903
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:34.183
<v Speaker 5>remember Steve,</v>

1904
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:36.560
<v Speaker 5>my buddy Steve beat the fuck out of Steve.</v>

1905
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:41.090
<v Speaker 5>And then I had to go with our next and the only reason why my instructor paired</v>

1906
00:50:41.091 --> 00:50:44.150
<v Speaker 5>me up with her was to punish her because she shouldn't have been going with me.</v>

1907
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:44.541
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

1908
00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:45.740
<v Speaker 5>that was when I was like,</v>

1909
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:48.200
<v Speaker 5>I was a US Open champion for time,</v>

1910
00:50:48.201 --> 00:50:49.240
<v Speaker 5>Massachusetts state champion.</v>

1911
00:50:49.241 --> 00:50:53.270
<v Speaker 5>It was a man and I was just a lot faster and stronger than us and bigger and she</v>

1912
00:50:53.271 --> 00:50:54.650
<v Speaker 5>fucking attacked me.</v>

1913
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:57.080
<v Speaker 5>She screamed like it was sparring.</v>

1914
00:50:57.110 --> 00:50:57.351
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1915
00:50:57.351 --> 00:50:58.190
<v Speaker 5>this is not a fight.</v>

1916
00:50:58.191 --> 00:51:03.191
<v Speaker 5>This is sparring and she screamed and just charged at me and I put a whooping on</v>

1917
00:51:04.521 --> 00:51:05.354
<v Speaker 5>this bitch.</v>

1918
00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:06.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1919
00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.150
<v Speaker 5>I never usually beat girls up,</v>

1920
00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:09.590
<v Speaker 5>but I put a beat on that girl.</v>

1921
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:10.641
<v Speaker 5>I didn't hit her,</v>

1922
00:51:10.641 --> 00:51:11.870
<v Speaker 5>I didn't hit her in her face.</v>

1923
00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:14.750
<v Speaker 5>I only hit her in her body and but I clowned her.</v>

1924
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:17.660
<v Speaker 5>I would like oh do things to her that I knew she couldn't do to me.</v>

1925
00:51:17.661 --> 00:51:21.110
<v Speaker 5>I like double kicker would kick with my left foot and the kick or my rifle at</v>

1926
00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:23.470
<v Speaker 5>the same time about to stand right in front.</v>

1927
00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:26.750
<v Speaker 5>I just did a bunch of shit that she couldn't do to me because you're at such a</v>

1928
00:51:26.751 --> 00:51:27.650
<v Speaker 5>disadvantage.</v>

1929
00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.180
<v Speaker 5>Like I've always thought I'm,</v>

1930
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.051
<v Speaker 5>yeah it was,</v>

1931
00:51:30.051 --> 00:51:31.150
<v Speaker 5>it was all a,</v>

1932
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:31.521
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1933
00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:32.840
<v Speaker 5>cause like I've seen that work.</v>

1934
00:51:32.841 --> 00:51:36.410
<v Speaker 5>Girls want to enter like that kind of sport and I'm all for women playing</v>

1935
00:51:36.411 --> 00:51:36.711
<v Speaker 5>sports.</v>

1936
00:51:36.711 --> 00:51:37.340
<v Speaker 5>If you're,</v>

1937
00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.230
<v Speaker 5>if you're an equal that's fine.</v>

1938
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:42.770
<v Speaker 5>But in a sport like this that there's a cultural exchange there that makes it</v>

1939
00:51:42.771 --> 00:51:43.470
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1940
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:44.211
<v Speaker 5>like football.</v>

1941
00:51:44.211 --> 00:51:44.421
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1942
00:51:44.421 --> 00:51:45.560
<v Speaker 5>when a girl wants to play football,</v>

1943
00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:46.693
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1944
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:47.730
<v Speaker 5>how do you feel about him?</v>

1945
00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:48.440
<v Speaker 5>Like a god,</v>

1946
00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.131
<v Speaker 5>it's going to get,</v>

1947
00:51:49.131 --> 00:51:50.630
<v Speaker 5>it's like girls in the military.</v>

1948
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.130
<v Speaker 5>Well let me explain it to you.</v>

1949
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.240
<v Speaker 5>When it comes to martial arts,</v>

1950
00:51:53.241 --> 00:51:53.960
<v Speaker 5>it's real simple.</v>

1951
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.060
<v Speaker 5>You don't take advantage of anybody that's below you.</v>

1952
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.421
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1953
00:51:56.421 --> 00:51:59.720
<v Speaker 5>you try to be as nice as possible to the underclass when you don't,</v>

1954
00:51:59.721 --> 00:52:01.580
<v Speaker 5>I mean occasionally when you're sparring,</v>

1955
00:52:01.581 --> 00:52:02.810
<v Speaker 5>especially with the contact,</v>

1956
00:52:02.811 --> 00:52:03.800
<v Speaker 5>like kicking and punching,</v>

1957
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:05.140
<v Speaker 5>someone gets knocked out and,</v>

1958
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:08.690
<v Speaker 5>but you don't ever try to knock out someone who's a lower ranked than you.</v>

1959
00:52:08.691 --> 00:52:09.950
<v Speaker 5>You always try to control yourself.</v>

1960
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:10.831
<v Speaker 5>Sit Happen.</v>

1961
00:52:10.831 --> 00:52:13.910
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes people running things or you catch someone funny and it just,</v>

1962
00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:15.920
<v Speaker 5>you didn't know you're gonna knock 'em out and they go unconscious.</v>

1963
00:52:15.921 --> 00:52:16.640
<v Speaker 5>That would happen,</v>

1964
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.980
<v Speaker 5>but you should never do it on purpose.</v>

1965
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:21.260
<v Speaker 5>And when someone who's a black belt,</v>

1966
00:52:21.261 --> 00:52:25.640
<v Speaker 5>like this woman was went after this guy who had like fucking 20 knee surgeries</v>

1967
00:52:25.641 --> 00:52:27.620
<v Speaker 5>can't move that good and he's not,</v>

1968
00:52:27.621 --> 00:52:27.861
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1969
00:52:27.861 --> 00:52:29.660
<v Speaker 5>he's only a green belt to just start off.</v>

1970
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:33.080
<v Speaker 5>And she went and attacked him like it was a god Damn Street fight.</v>

1971
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.561
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>

1972
00:52:33.561 --> 00:52:33.951
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>

1973
00:52:33.951 --> 00:52:38.150
<v Speaker 5>there's a level of aggression that people sometimes will take out on people in</v>

1974
00:52:38.151 --> 00:52:38.601
<v Speaker 5>sparring.</v>

1975
00:52:38.601 --> 00:52:40.880
<v Speaker 5>The only reason they do it is because they can,</v>

1976
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:42.020
<v Speaker 5>it's just bullying.</v>

1977
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:43.011
<v Speaker 5>That's all it is.</v>

1978
00:52:43.011 --> 00:52:44.030
<v Speaker 5>It's straight bullying.</v>

1979
00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:47.000
<v Speaker 5>She would go after guys and beat the shit out of him,</v>

1980
00:52:47.001 --> 00:52:48.380
<v Speaker 5>but I see her spar women,</v>

1981
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:49.490
<v Speaker 5>nothing like that.</v>

1982
00:52:49.491 --> 00:52:49.930
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

1983
00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:50.990
<v Speaker 5>When she would spar women,</v>

1984
00:52:50.991 --> 00:52:52.490
<v Speaker 5>she would take it easy on them.</v>

1985
00:52:52.491 --> 00:52:53.120
<v Speaker 5>She would,</v>

1986
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.710
<v Speaker 5>she would pull her punches and kicks.</v>

1987
00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:56.600
<v Speaker 5>She was trying to knock guys out.</v>

1988
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.441
<v Speaker 5>There was a,</v>

1989
00:52:57.441 --> 00:53:00.770
<v Speaker 5>there was a real aggression to what she charged after me may like screamed at</v>

1990
00:53:00.771 --> 00:53:00.861
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

1991
00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:03.800
<v Speaker 5>I was like 19 and when I was 19 I was,</v>

1992
00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:08.780
<v Speaker 5>I was half crazy and I was not taking it from some bitch.</v>

1993
00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.910
<v Speaker 5>I put a beating on this check.</v>

1994
00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:13.520
<v Speaker 5>I stomped her in the chest.</v>

1995
00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:18.550
<v Speaker 5>I remember like not not knowing how to hit her so that it was more of a push</v>

1996
00:53:19.101 --> 00:53:19.880
<v Speaker 5>than a kick,</v>

1997
00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:20.930
<v Speaker 5>but just to let her know what's up.</v>

1998
00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:23.120
<v Speaker 5>Launched her to the air and she's skid on her butt.</v>

1999
00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.560
<v Speaker 5>And then I chased her down and they stood over</v>

2000
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.680
<v Speaker 2>and then I let her get back up and then I just started beating on her.</v>

2001
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.480
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget this because I was,</v>

2002
00:53:30.481 --> 00:53:33.240
<v Speaker 2>it was a real moment in my life where I said,</v>

2003
00:53:33.241 --> 00:53:34.650
<v Speaker 2>I am not going to hurt her.</v>

2004
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:38.040
<v Speaker 2>I am not going to hurt her because my instincts were to knock on unconscious.</v>

2005
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:39.690
<v Speaker 2>My instincts were to kick her in the face.</v>

2006
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:40.111
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2007
00:53:40.111 --> 00:53:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna kick this pitch in the face,</v>

2008
00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:42.211
<v Speaker 2>but I can't.</v>

2009
00:53:42.211 --> 00:53:42.301
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2010
00:53:42.301 --> 00:53:42.660
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

2011
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you can do that.</v>

2012
00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:44.431
<v Speaker 2>So it was a,</v>

2013
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:44.791
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

2014
00:53:44.791 --> 00:53:48.450
<v Speaker 2>it was a battle because I was in a fight with a woman because if it was a guy</v>

2015
00:53:48.451 --> 00:53:50.310
<v Speaker 2>and he took advantage of another guy like that,</v>

2016
00:53:50.311 --> 00:53:50.700
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>

2017
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:53.010
<v Speaker 2>that's your thought is I'm going to knock this guy out.</v>

2018
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:54.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna kick him in the face.</v>

2019
00:53:54.151 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 2>He deserves this.</v>

2020
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:56.910
<v Speaker 2>But then you go,</v>

2021
00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:00.780
<v Speaker 2>I have to make a concession here because this is a woman.</v>

2022
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:01.640
<v Speaker 2>So he said,</v>

2023
00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.473
<v Speaker 2>you have to like,</v>

2024
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:03.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2025
00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:03.711
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

2026
00:54:03.711 --> 00:54:07.750
<v Speaker 2>there were times in the gym where it just became all out fights and,</v>

2027
00:54:07.751 --> 00:54:08.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2028
00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:08.470
<v Speaker 2>luck.</v>

2029
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:11.670
<v Speaker 2>There was two times that I could really remember one of them.</v>

2030
00:54:11.671 --> 00:54:12.301
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>

2031
00:54:12.301 --> 00:54:14.250
<v Speaker 2>it was when we had concrete floors,</v>

2032
00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:18.000
<v Speaker 2>we only had office carpeting over concrete floors,</v>

2033
00:54:18.001 --> 00:54:19.980
<v Speaker 2>and we would spar full contact.</v>

2034
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:21.090
<v Speaker 2>This is no bullshit.</v>

2035
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:23.280
<v Speaker 2>And this was a hardcore fucking school.</v>

2036
00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.273
<v Speaker 2>We would fight in these,</v>

2037
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:25.740
<v Speaker 2>these taekwondo tournament,</v>

2038
00:54:25.741 --> 00:54:26.431
<v Speaker 2>and they were scary.</v>

2039
00:54:26.431 --> 00:54:30.240
<v Speaker 2>But the training was scarier than the fucking fights because at least the f the</v>

2040
00:54:30.241 --> 00:54:30.900
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

2041
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:31.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2042
00:54:31.411 --> 00:54:32.010
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

2043
00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:33.180
<v Speaker 2>you would be with your friends.</v>

2044
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.170
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like fight club,</v>

2045
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:35.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2046
00:54:35.281 --> 00:54:38.250
<v Speaker 2>all their shit and they're all preparing and you're gonna have to find a four or</v>

2047
00:54:38.251 --> 00:54:38.461
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

2048
00:54:38.461 --> 00:54:39.900
<v Speaker 2>six times when you're fighting,</v>

2049
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.910
<v Speaker 2>you're probably going to find someone who's not as good as your training</v>

2050
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:44.700
<v Speaker 2>partners and you're not going to have to fight as many times.</v>

2051
00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:44.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2052
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:46.170
<v Speaker 2>it's like it was way easier,</v>

2053
00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:50.190
<v Speaker 2>but like new guys would come in all the time and it would wind up being just a</v>

2054
00:54:50.191 --> 00:54:50.791
<v Speaker 2>brawl.</v>

2055
00:54:50.791 --> 00:54:51.660
<v Speaker 2>That's all it was.</v>

2056
00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:52.470
<v Speaker 2>It'd been,</v>

2057
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:55.650
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember how many times we had to drive people to the hospital after we</v>

2058
00:54:55.651 --> 00:54:56.460
<v Speaker 2>fucked them up.</v>

2059
00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Cause we would get in these situations where a guy would come in from another</v>

2060
00:54:59.821 --> 00:55:01.770
<v Speaker 2>school and a year usually weren't that good,</v>

2061
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:02.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2062
00:55:02.281 --> 00:55:03.060
<v Speaker 2>and they would get,</v>

2063
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:07.230
<v Speaker 2>they would get cocky or insulin and then the instructor would let them go join</v>

2064
00:55:07.231 --> 00:55:07.621
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

2065
00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:07.771
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2066
00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:08.460
<v Speaker 2>go ahead,</v>

2067
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:09.001
<v Speaker 2>put your club.</v>

2068
00:55:09.001 --> 00:55:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Would you like to join our class?</v>

2069
00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.460
<v Speaker 2>We can have the first class for free.</v>

2070
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.830
<v Speaker 2>And we know we were just supposed to beat the fuck out of this guy.</v>

2071
00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:14.873
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

2072
00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:17.010
<v Speaker 2>it was completely irresponsible.</v>

2073
00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:21.570
<v Speaker 2>But that's how it was handled when anybody was a Adeline and they came to the</v>

2074
00:55:21.571 --> 00:55:21.871
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

2075
00:55:21.871 --> 00:55:24.900
<v Speaker 2>he wound up being a street fight and Hong Kong Crete.</v>

2076
00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.690
<v Speaker 2>It was a thin office carpet on concrete.</v>

2077
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.310
<v Speaker 2>So this is how I essentially grew up from age 15 to 21.</v>

2078
00:55:32.311 --> 00:55:33.330
<v Speaker 2>That's all I did.</v>

2079
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.610
<v Speaker 2>So when some chick is screaming at me,</v>

2080
00:55:35.611 --> 00:55:36.630
<v Speaker 2>chasing after me,</v>

2081
00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:39.510
<v Speaker 2>like she's going to like attack me after I watched her just beat up my friend,</v>

2082
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:40.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2083
00:55:40.141 --> 00:55:40.470
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

2084
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:41.520
<v Speaker 2>that was not happening,</v>

2085
00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:42.540
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

2086
00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:46.350
<v Speaker 2>it was a milestone for me where I was able to not hurt her.</v>

2087
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:46.831
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2088
00:55:46.831 --> 00:55:47.970
<v Speaker 2>it was like very important.</v>

2089
00:55:47.971 --> 00:55:49.530
<v Speaker 2>So it was like 20 pounds heavier than I was.</v>

2090
00:55:49.531 --> 00:55:50.364
<v Speaker 2>Totally unfair,</v>

2091
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:52.200
<v Speaker 2>but I was able to not hurt her.</v>

2092
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.250
<v Speaker 2>Very important.</v>

2093
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:53.581
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2094
00:55:53.581 --> 00:55:54.061
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2095
00:55:54.061 --> 00:55:54.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2096
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was the night we did your show,</v>

2097
00:55:56.791 --> 00:55:57.011
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2098
00:55:57.011 --> 00:55:57.844
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2099
00:55:58.050 --> 00:55:59.940
<v Speaker 2>I was at a comedy club one night,</v>

2100
00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:00.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2101
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:02.140
<v Speaker 2>and afterwards there was a,</v>

2102
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:03.240
<v Speaker 2>there was an argument I was,</v>

2103
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:05.330
<v Speaker 2>I had headlined there or something.</v>

2104
00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:08.400
<v Speaker 2>There was an argument about buying drinks or something,</v>

2105
00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:11.040
<v Speaker 2>and a couple of argued with a waitress and the,</v>

2106
00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:12.510
<v Speaker 2>the women were fighting the,</v>

2107
00:56:12.511 --> 00:56:12.850
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2108
00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:13.160
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2109
00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:17.160
<v Speaker 2>the girl that didn't want to pay our bill was arguing with the waitress at the</v>

2110
00:56:17.161 --> 00:56:18.420
<v Speaker 2>comedy club and they were screaming,</v>

2111
00:56:18.421 --> 00:56:19.254
<v Speaker 2>yelling at each other.</v>

2112
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:21.840
<v Speaker 2>It pours out kind of into the street.</v>

2113
00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:23.483
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2114
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:24.570
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2115
00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:24.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2116
00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.680
<v Speaker 4>waiter stands up for the waitress.</v>

2117
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:29.530
<v Speaker 4>This black dude standing up for the waitress going,</v>

2118
00:56:29.531 --> 00:56:29.801
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2119
00:56:29.801 --> 00:56:30.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2120
00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:31.870
<v Speaker 4>you need to back off,</v>

2121
00:56:31.871 --> 00:56:32.051
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

2122
00:56:32.051 --> 00:56:32.201
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

2123
00:56:32.201 --> 00:56:33.034
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

2124
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:36.790
<v Speaker 4>And so then her husband gets in.</v>

2125
00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:39.750
<v Speaker 4>So it's the black guy and the husband who's a Mexican date,</v>

2126
00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:40.391
<v Speaker 4>so black guy,</v>

2127
00:56:40.391 --> 00:56:41.224
<v Speaker 4>Mexican dude,</v>

2128
00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:45.100
<v Speaker 4>and the Mexican guy's wife is standing behind them and they're arguing and</v>

2129
00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:45.791
<v Speaker 4>they're about the,</v>

2130
00:56:45.791 --> 00:56:47.200
<v Speaker 4>it's escalating into a fight.</v>

2131
00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:51.430
<v Speaker 4>And you can tell the Mexican dude does not want to fight,</v>

2132
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:52.300
<v Speaker 4>but he's,</v>

2133
00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.740
<v Speaker 4>he standing his ground,</v>

2134
00:56:53.741 --> 00:56:54.820
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't want to fight.</v>

2135
00:56:54.821 --> 00:56:55.001
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2136
00:56:55.001 --> 00:56:56.230
<v Speaker 4>when two guys are going in,</v>

2137
00:56:56.231 --> 00:56:57.064
<v Speaker 4>the black dudes like,</v>

2138
00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:57.490
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>

2139
00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:58.690

00:56:58.890 --> 00:56:59.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2141
00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:00.750
<v Speaker 4>you pay your bill,</v>

2142
00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:01.481
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck out,</v>

2143
00:57:01.481 --> 00:57:01.601

00:57:01.601 --> 00:57:01.751

<v Speaker 5>that's the darkest moment ever.</v>

2184
00:58:05.891 --> 00:58:06.401
<v Speaker 5>When you really,</v>

2185
00:58:06.401 --> 00:58:07.010
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

2186
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:08.290
<v Speaker 5>someone is fucking punching me.</v>

2187
00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:11.020
<v Speaker 5>A girl punched me on set once to just didn't quite catch me.</v>

2188
00:58:11.021 --> 00:58:12.370
<v Speaker 5>I put my hand up just in time.</v>

2189
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:13.600
<v Speaker 5>I was doing this show.</v>

2190
00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:16.390
<v Speaker 5>It was for Merv Griffin and um,</v>

2191
00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.080
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2192
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.700
<v Speaker 5>it was a law show,</v>

2193
00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:19.140
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

2194
00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.260
<v Speaker 5>like a courtroom show.</v>

2195
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:22.510
<v Speaker 5>We were going to call it like Rogan's law.</v>

2196
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.290
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

2197
00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:24.340
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't really a judge,</v>

2198
00:58:24.341 --> 00:58:25.720
<v Speaker 5>but I would like decide your cases.</v>

2199
00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:27.590
<v Speaker 5>It's been done since then again.</v>

2200
00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:28.910
<v Speaker 5>I think Paul Mooney did it.</v>

2201
00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:30.211
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2202
00:58:30.211 --> 00:58:30.880
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2203
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:31.840
<v Speaker 5>I rarely does it.</v>

2204
00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:32.921
<v Speaker 5>Comedy quarter.</v>

2205
00:58:32.921 --> 00:58:33.101
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2206
00:58:33.101 --> 00:58:33.730
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

2207
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:34.870
<v Speaker 5>And then someone else did it too.</v>

2208
00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:35.733
<v Speaker 5>There was another one,</v>

2209
00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:37.930
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember who the other comic was too.</v>

2210
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:38.710
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>

2211
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.841
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2212
00:58:38.841 --> 00:58:40.030
<v Speaker 5>so it's a funny idea.</v>

2213
00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:40.953
<v Speaker 5>It could have been fun,</v>

2214
00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.670
<v Speaker 5>but they had a bailiff or whatever.</v>

2215
00:58:42.671 --> 00:58:44.530
<v Speaker 5>It was a court reporter,</v>

2216
00:58:44.531 --> 00:58:45.364
<v Speaker 5>the court reporter,</v>

2217
00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:47.720
<v Speaker 5>and she was this chick professional hot check,</v>

2218
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:49.990
<v Speaker 5>a little worn out,</v>

2219
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.863
<v Speaker 5>little weathered,</v>

2220
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:51.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2221
00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:55.150
<v Speaker 5>not a bad girl but was partying fucking hard.</v>

2222
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:56.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean just red lining it.</v>

2223
00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.720
<v Speaker 5>And she was one of those girls that would come over and she would flirt with all</v>

2224
00:59:01.721 --> 00:59:02.920
<v Speaker 5>the writers.</v>

2225
00:59:02.921 --> 00:59:04.090
<v Speaker 5>And I mean this is like,</v>

2226
00:59:04.091 --> 00:59:05.680
<v Speaker 5>she hadn't really done anything yet.</v>

2227
00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:07.690
<v Speaker 5>She had a star on her back and I go,</v>

2228
00:59:07.691 --> 00:59:08.261
<v Speaker 5>why do you have a star?</v>

2229
00:59:08.261 --> 00:59:09.880
<v Speaker 5>She'll self fulfilling prophecy.</v>

2230
00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:11.373
<v Speaker 5>She actually said that,</v>

2231
00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:12.100
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

2232
00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.900
<v Speaker 5>that's how I mean you say whoa man.</v>

2233
00:59:13.901 --> 00:59:15.430
<v Speaker 5>But that's all a lot of actors think.</v>

2234
00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:17.620
<v Speaker 5>And I tell you before I had children,</v>

2235
00:59:17.621 --> 00:59:20.730
<v Speaker 5>I looked at it completely differently cause I used to look at it and go through</v>

2236
00:59:20.731 --> 00:59:23.870
<v Speaker 5>this fucking crazy bitch fucking self fulfilling prophecy.</v>

2237
00:59:23.871 --> 00:59:24.980
<v Speaker 5>I would go agro with it,</v>

2238
00:59:24.981 --> 00:59:25.191
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2239
00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:25.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2240
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:29.460
<v Speaker 5>But now I look at it and I see a little kid that was just raised all fucked up.</v>

2241
00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:30.290
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2242
00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:32.930
<v Speaker 5>she was only like 29 or 30 years old or something like that.</v>

2243
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:35.120
<v Speaker 5>And she looked like she was closing in on 40.</v>

2244
00:59:35.121 --> 00:59:38.330
<v Speaker 5>She looked 10 years older than her age and she was just hitting it hard.</v>

2245
00:59:38.331 --> 00:59:38.660
<v Speaker 5>And two,</v>

2246
00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:39.980
<v Speaker 5>I probably was a great girl.</v>

2247
00:59:39.981 --> 00:59:43.490
<v Speaker 5>She probably wasn't batches they all need love or something.</v>

2248
00:59:43.491 --> 00:59:46.340
<v Speaker 5>They're all broken and damaged on little children that just didn't get enough</v>

2249
00:59:46.341 --> 00:59:46.701
<v Speaker 5>attention.</v>

2250
00:59:46.701 --> 00:59:49.580
<v Speaker 5>They should change the Hollywood sign to daddy didn't love me.</v>

2251
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:50.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2252
00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:51.053
<v Speaker 5>it's true.</v>

2253
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:52.160
<v Speaker 5>That's my problem.</v>

2254
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.821
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2255
00:59:52.821 --> 00:59:53.240
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2256
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:53.750
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>

2257
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:54.110
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2258
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:54.470
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>

2259
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:58.010
<v Speaker 5>she goes out the night before we have to film and uh,</v>

2260
00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if she's nervous because this is like a,</v>

2261
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:00.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2262
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.030
<v Speaker 5>this is like the first thing that she's ever done,</v>

2263
01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:04.780
<v Speaker 5>this pilot and she gets coke,</v>

2264
01:00:04.781 --> 01:00:05.990
<v Speaker 5>does it to the gills.</v>

2265
01:00:05.991 --> 01:00:09.950
<v Speaker 5>She stays up all night and she shows up in the morning to film with no sleep,</v>

2266
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.740
<v Speaker 5>no sleep and crashing hard,</v>

2267
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:15.380
<v Speaker 5>crashing hard and going full psycho mode.</v>

2268
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:16.131
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2269
01:00:16.131 --> 01:00:18.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm the one who's got to take these cases.</v>

2270
01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.490
<v Speaker 5>So they tell me,</v>

2271
01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:20.060

2274
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:25.310
<v Speaker 5>I before I meet the people and they actually come up with the case.</v>

2275
01:00:25.311 --> 01:00:27.740
<v Speaker 5>I sit down with a notepad and I started going,</v>

2276
01:00:27.741 --> 01:00:28.080
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2277

<v Speaker 5>These people are like real issues.</v>

2279
01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:30.620

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:30.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2281
01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:34.160
<v Speaker 5>I have to really figure out what this is and what's funny about it and I'm</v>

2282
01:00:34.161 --> 01:00:35.900
<v Speaker 5>trying to make it so some sitting there writing,</v>

2283

<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

2284
01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>

2285

<v Speaker 5>I'm so tense,</v>

2286
01:00:37.951 --> 01:00:38.161

01:00:49.101 --> 01:00:49.460
<v Speaker 5>we only,</v>

2303
01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:50.630

2304
01:00:50.631 --> 01:00:51.470
<v Speaker 5>I really can't</v>

<v Speaker 6>you fucking asshole you fucking house all.</v>

2306
01:00:55.301 --> 01:00:56.680
<v Speaker 6>I just asked you to be nice.</v>

2307
01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:57.950
<v Speaker 6>I just asked you to read.</v>

2308
01:00:57.951 --> 01:00:59.940
<v Speaker 6>Now it's like I'm fucking nervous and I am,</v>

2309
01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:04.540
<v Speaker 5>and it was just complete 100% psycho.</v>

2310
01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:04.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2311
01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.960
<v Speaker 5>She just did not have any connection with reality.</v>

2312
01:01:07.961 --> 01:01:12.850
<v Speaker 5>There was no rational response to the way the conversation was going,</v>

2313
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:13.211
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2314
01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:14.740
<v Speaker 5>you should like if someone says,</v>

2315
01:01:14.741 --> 01:01:15.910
<v Speaker 5>can I have a massage?</v>

2316
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:16.691
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2317
01:01:16.691 --> 01:01:18.220
<v Speaker 5>and then you tell them that you're working,</v>

2318
01:01:18.221 --> 01:01:18.790
<v Speaker 5>they should be like,</v>

2319
01:01:18.790 --> 01:01:19.180
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2320
01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:19.511
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2321
01:01:19.511 --> 01:01:20.260
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

2322
01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:20.861
<v Speaker 5>what am I doing?</v>

2323
01:01:20.861 --> 01:01:21.730
<v Speaker 5>Asking you for a massage.</v>

2324
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:22.270
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2325
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:23.230
<v Speaker 5>laugh about it.</v>

2326
01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.220
<v Speaker 5>Like silly me,</v>

2327
01:01:24.221 --> 01:01:24.371
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2328
01:01:24.371 --> 01:01:25.031
<v Speaker 5>you're the one that needs,</v>

2329
01:01:25.031 --> 01:01:26.320
<v Speaker 5>I'll get somebody else to rub my back.</v>

2330
01:01:26.321 --> 01:01:27.154
<v Speaker 5>Don't worry about it.</v>

2331
01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.600
<v Speaker 5>But it was like this weird thing where she wanted attention.</v>

2332
01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:32.050
<v Speaker 5>She wanted like sexual attention.</v>

2333
01:01:32.051 --> 01:01:33.610
<v Speaker 5>She wanted to be attractive.</v>

2334
01:01:33.611 --> 01:01:34.720
<v Speaker 5>She wanted someone to,</v>

2335
01:01:34.721 --> 01:01:34.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2336
01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.120
<v Speaker 5>to dote on her so that she would feel better.</v>

2337
01:01:37.121 --> 01:01:41.080
<v Speaker 5>But she was just whacked out from the coke or whatever the fuck she was doing</v>

2338
01:01:41.081 --> 01:01:42.190
<v Speaker 5>math or whenever it was.</v>

2339
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:46.180
<v Speaker 5>But she was clearly up all night and she was with her friend and her friend just</v>

2340
01:01:46.181 --> 01:01:46.900
<v Speaker 5>had these,</v>

2341
01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:47.290
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

2342
01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:49.060
<v Speaker 5>this thousand yard stare,</v>

2343
01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:52.270
<v Speaker 5>this just lost look in her eye.</v>

2344
01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:52.631
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2345
01:01:52.631 --> 01:01:52.871
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2346
01:01:52.871 --> 01:01:57.460
<v Speaker 5>like these bitches had just been to nom and came back with their shoes and their</v>

2347
01:01:57.461 --> 01:01:59.770
<v Speaker 5>hands barefoot walking to the parking lot,</v>

2348
01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:00.341
<v Speaker 5>looking at it,</v>

2349
01:02:00.341 --> 01:02:01.330
<v Speaker 5>take a hooker bath.</v>

2350
01:02:01.331 --> 01:02:03.850
<v Speaker 5>And the dressing room sink and I'm not bullshitting.</v>

2351
01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.530
<v Speaker 5>So she's like throwing makeup on.</v>

2352
01:02:05.531 --> 01:02:08.260
<v Speaker 5>But she's super frustrating cause she's got heavy bags under her eyes.</v>

2353
01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.970
<v Speaker 5>She's just gacked out of her head.</v>

2354
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:10.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2355
01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.141
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

2356
01:02:11.141 --> 01:02:11.291
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2357
01:02:11.291 --> 01:02:13.720
<v Speaker 5>they wound up using a girl who was an extra,</v>

2358
01:02:13.721 --> 01:02:14.381
<v Speaker 5>they fired her.</v>

2359
01:02:14.381 --> 01:02:15.310
<v Speaker 5>She took a swing at me.</v>

2360
01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:16.810
<v Speaker 5>That's what I didn't get to the point.</v>

2361
01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.260
<v Speaker 5>She took a swing at me.</v>

2362
01:02:18.261 --> 01:02:19.590
<v Speaker 5>And when you no,</v>

2363

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2390

<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

2391
01:02:41.421 --> 01:02:42.450

<v Speaker 2>you're hitting me.</v>

2397
01:02:46.171 --> 01:02:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2398
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that because that's,</v>

2399
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.010
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking a salt.</v>

2400
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:50.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2401
01:02:50.161 --> 01:02:50.994
<v Speaker 2>that's what I said to her.</v>

2402
01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:52.491
<v Speaker 2>Which way to,</v>

2403
01:02:52.491 --> 01:02:52.891
<v Speaker 2>or even more,</v>

2404
01:02:52.891 --> 01:02:53.130
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2405
01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:53.700
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

2406
01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.630
<v Speaker 2>that's illegal.</v>

2407
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:55.051
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2408
01:02:55.051 --> 01:02:55.884
<v Speaker 2>that's a assault.</v>

2409
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:57.060
<v Speaker 2>You can go to jail for that.</v>

2410
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.200
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be hitting people.</v>

2411
01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:58.770
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2412
01:02:58.770 --> 01:02:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Look man,</v>

2413
01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:01.430
<v Speaker 2>a man should certainly not hit a woman by,</v>

2414
01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:02.850
<v Speaker 2>by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

2415
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:04.260
<v Speaker 2>And then she,</v>

2416
01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:04.741
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2417
01:03:04.741 --> 01:03:05.880
<v Speaker 2>And men shouldn't hit men,</v>

2418
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:06.660
<v Speaker 2>but women,</v>

2419
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:06.891
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2420
01:03:06.891 --> 01:03:07.740
<v Speaker 2>you're hitting a man.</v>

2421
01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 2>You're crazy.</v>

2422
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.330
<v Speaker 2>That's like if I went over and punched a monkey or a gorilla or something like</v>

2423
01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:12.541
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2424
01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:13.530
<v Speaker 2>the thing that kill you,</v>

2425
01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:14.581
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

2426
01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:15.600
<v Speaker 2>You're going to hit a man.</v>

2427
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Somebody,</v>

2428
01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.700
<v Speaker 2>I just saw something that somebody said,</v>

2429
01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.920
<v Speaker 2>those bumper stickers,</v>

2430
01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:22.470
<v Speaker 2>there's never an excuse for a man to hit a woman.</v>

2431
01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.200
<v Speaker 2>And it's like there's never an excuse for anyone to hit anyone.</v>

2432
01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2433
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:26.100
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2434
01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Unless it's self defense.</v>

2435
01:03:27.781 --> 01:03:30.420
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're trying to save your life or your consciousness or,</v>

2436
01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:32.820
<v Speaker 2>or stop someone from beating somebody else up.</v>

2437
01:03:32.821 --> 01:03:33.061
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2438
01:03:33.061 --> 01:03:33.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2439
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:33.931
<v Speaker 2>I had a girlfriend,</v>

2440
01:03:33.931 --> 01:03:35.580
<v Speaker 2>her doing that to a girl doing that.</v>

2441
01:03:35.581 --> 01:03:35.821
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

2442
01:03:35.821 --> 01:03:38.400
<v Speaker 2>it's like me going up to Alistair Overeem and punching him.</v>

2443
01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:39.301
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to do that.</v>

2444
01:03:39.301 --> 01:03:40.410
<v Speaker 2>He's going to fucking kill me.</v>

2445
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.530
<v Speaker 2>I had a girlfriend punch me while I was in bed sleeping.</v>

2446
01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:44.483
<v Speaker 2>Oh my</v>

2447

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:46.873
<v Speaker 2>I tagged.</v>

2449
01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.540
<v Speaker 2>I didn't pay for it though.</v>

2450
01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.250
<v Speaker 2>Brian's all like whatever,</v>

2451
01:03:50.251 --> 01:03:51.084
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2452
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:54.570
<v Speaker 2>I woke up with this just wailing on me.</v>

2453
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2454
01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.040
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of what mine was.</v>

2455
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I kicked the girl like I,</v>

2456
01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:58.930
<v Speaker 2>she was living with me.</v>

2457
01:03:58.930 --> 01:03:59.581
<v Speaker 2>I kicked her out.</v>

2458
01:03:59.581 --> 01:04:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2459
01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:00.630
<v Speaker 2>she was just,</v>

2460
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:04.620
<v Speaker 2>she was like out all night doing coke and not coming home and shit like that and</v>

2461
01:04:04.621 --> 01:04:04.861
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2462
01:04:04.861 --> 01:04:05.790
<v Speaker 2>just fucking move.</v>

2463
01:04:05.791 --> 01:04:06.650
<v Speaker 2>Just get your shit out.</v>

2464
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.600
<v Speaker 2>So I come home one night and her dog has shit all over my house,</v>

2465
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.100
<v Speaker 2>like everywhere I go.</v>

2466
01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:13.380
<v Speaker 2>And she was supposed to be home and she just stayed out all night.</v>

2467
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.281
<v Speaker 2>Like I was out.</v>

2468
01:04:14.281 --> 01:04:17.730
<v Speaker 2>I come back and her dog shit all over my house and she didn't like,</v>

2469
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:18.331
<v Speaker 2>and I go,</v>

2470
01:04:18.331 --> 01:04:18.900
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

2471
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:19.231
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2472
01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:19.740
<v Speaker 2>And she was up,</v>

2473
01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.491
<v Speaker 2>she was hot.</v>

2474
01:04:20.491 --> 01:04:21.301
<v Speaker 2>She was super hot.</v>

2475
01:04:21.301 --> 01:04:22.111
<v Speaker 2>She was a stripper.</v>

2476
01:04:22.111 --> 01:04:23.340
<v Speaker 2>And if my fault,</v>

2477
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:23.820
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2478
01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:24.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2479
01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:25.680
<v Speaker 2>like you know what he's talking about.</v>

2480
01:04:25.681 --> 01:04:26.610
<v Speaker 2>It sounds perfect.</v>

2481
01:04:26.611 --> 01:04:27.031
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>

2482
01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:27.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2483
01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.800
<v Speaker 2>everything sounds like it's in place.</v>

2484
01:04:28.810 --> 01:04:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2485
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:31.280
<v Speaker 2>But like we've got it all when you were,</v>

2486
01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:32.041
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

2487
01:04:32.041 --> 01:04:32.970
<v Speaker 2>when your data's stripper,</v>

2488
01:04:32.971 --> 01:04:34.620
<v Speaker 2>it's like doing heroin the first time.</v>

2489
01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:34.891
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2490
01:04:34.891 --> 01:04:36.330
<v Speaker 2>all this is fucking amazing.</v>

2491
01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:39.860
<v Speaker 2>And then the next time and your friends are all shaking your head did,</v>

2492
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:40.681
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to do this.</v>

2493
01:04:40.681 --> 01:04:42.420
<v Speaker 2>It always ends up ugly.</v>

2494
01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:42.931
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

2495
01:04:42.931 --> 01:04:43.111
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2496
01:04:43.111 --> 01:04:43.231
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2497
01:04:43.231 --> 01:04:43.471
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2498
01:04:43.471 --> 01:04:43.860
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2499
01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:44.910
<v Speaker 2>this one's different.</v>

2500
01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:45.990
<v Speaker 2>This one's different.</v>

2501
01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:47.610
<v Speaker 2>So I've dated strippers,</v>

2502
01:04:47.611 --> 01:04:48.900
<v Speaker 2>it turned out to be very nice girls.</v>

2503
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.210
<v Speaker 2>But I saw,</v>

2504
01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:52.440
<v Speaker 2>and I'm friends with some girls that are dancers,</v>

2505
01:04:52.441 --> 01:04:54.600
<v Speaker 2>but this one was fucking the psycho she has,</v>

2506
01:04:54.601 --> 01:04:55.800
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of schools out there.</v>

2507
01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.370
<v Speaker 2>So I go,</v>

2508
01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:56.611
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2509
01:04:56.611 --> 01:04:56.920
<v Speaker 2>you gotta,</v>

2510
01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:57.840
<v Speaker 2>you gotta go,</v>

2511
01:04:57.841 --> 01:04:58.380
<v Speaker 2>you gotta get out.</v>

2512
01:04:58.380 --> 01:04:59.610
<v Speaker 2>I called her on the front.</v>

2513
01:04:59.611 --> 01:05:02.130
<v Speaker 2>I go and put in your shit outside my house and,</v>

2514
01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:03.930
<v Speaker 2>and just come and get it and go.</v>

2515
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:04.980
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't have a lot of stuff.</v>

2516
01:05:04.981 --> 01:05:05.281
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2517
01:05:05.281 --> 01:05:07.510
<v Speaker 2>just come get your stuff and go somewhere and go,</v>

2518
01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:07.571
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2519
01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:09.110
<v Speaker 2>that's what you fucked up because you,</v>

2520
01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.200
<v Speaker 2>you made her come to you.</v>

2521
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:11.070
<v Speaker 2>You should never do that.</v>

2522
01:05:11.071 --> 01:05:14.370
<v Speaker 2>We were supposed to do is have it brought to her by the blackest dude,</v>

2523
01:05:14.371 --> 01:05:15.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2524
01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't realize the biggest,</v>

2525
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:17.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2526

2528
01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:19.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2529
01:05:19.481 --> 01:05:19.690
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2530
01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:21.160
<v Speaker 3>if you don't get a black Samoan,</v>

2531
01:05:21.161 --> 01:05:23.380
<v Speaker 3>we'll do angry looking Simone,</v>

2532
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.590
<v Speaker 3>hopefully with some fucking visible tattoos near his neck.</v>

2533
01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:27.810
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2534
01:05:27.810 --> 01:05:28.540
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2535
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:29.860
<v Speaker 3>I came home and I was just like,</v>

2536
01:05:29.861 --> 01:05:31.060
<v Speaker 3>fuck the dog and shit.</v>

2537
01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:31.721
<v Speaker 3>I was so mad.</v>

2538
01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:32.350
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2539
01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:33.370
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't do it.</v>

2540
01:05:33.371 --> 01:05:34.540
<v Speaker 3>I didn't put her stuff outside,</v>

2541
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:40.090
<v Speaker 3>but she came home and raged and I'm just in bed sleeping and she just starts</v>

2542
01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:41.110
<v Speaker 3>wailing on me.</v>

2543
01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:41.891
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

2544
01:05:41.891 --> 01:05:42.161
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

2545
01:05:42.161 --> 01:05:42.970
<v Speaker 3>you're lucky.</v>

2546
01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:43.420
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

2547
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:46.000
<v Speaker 3>I almost called the cops and told them you had a gun.</v>

2548
01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:47.230
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2549
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:52.210
<v Speaker 3>they would have taken me to jail like w how crazy are you?</v>

2550
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:55.210
<v Speaker 3>And a funny thing is I broke up with her since then and,</v>

2551
01:05:55.211 --> 01:05:55.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2552
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:56.530
<v Speaker 3>like years ago.</v>

2553
01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:57.280
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2554
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.010
<v Speaker 3>I just googled her to see what's going on.</v>

2555
01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.130
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I could find,</v>

2556
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:03.220
<v Speaker 3>he said she was arrested for assault.</v>

2557
01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm like some other dude.</v>

2558
01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

2559
01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:06.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2560
01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:06.761
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2561
01:06:06.761 --> 01:06:09.310
<v Speaker 3>some people grow up thinking it's okay to hit people,</v>

2562
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.940
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2563
01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:11.410
<v Speaker 3>Especially like in the household,</v>

2564
01:06:11.411 --> 01:06:13.450
<v Speaker 3>if they see their mom and her dad beating each other up,</v>

2565
01:06:13.451 --> 01:06:16.270
<v Speaker 3>they grow up in that environment and they think that that's how relationships</v>

2566
01:06:16.271 --> 01:06:16.780
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

2567
01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:17.740
<v Speaker 3>You get mad at someone,</v>

2568
01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:19.630
<v Speaker 3>you lash out at them like a child.</v>

2569
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.240
<v Speaker 3>I have one girlfriend do it,</v>

2570
01:06:22.241 --> 01:06:23.530
<v Speaker 3>but she didn't really do it.</v>

2571
01:06:23.531 --> 01:06:25.090
<v Speaker 3>She kind of halfheartedly did it.</v>

2572
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:28.570
<v Speaker 3>She just is mad at me and she was young and we were both young and she was like</v>

2573
01:06:28.571 --> 01:06:31.210
<v Speaker 3>20 I was like 21 she sorta took a swing at him.</v>

2574
01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.980

2651
01:08:50.841 --> 01:08:51.890
<v Speaker 2>you should punch her in the face.</v>

2652
01:08:51.891 --> 01:08:52.620
<v Speaker 2>If you can't,</v>

2653
01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:55.160
<v Speaker 2>it's the way to save your life to say that you shouldn't.</v>

2663
01:09:10.311 --> 01:09:11.300
<v Speaker 2>for some people,</v>

2665
01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:16.100
<v Speaker 2>like I get accused sometimes of being a misogynist because I'm just honest about</v>

2666
01:09:16.101 --> 01:09:16.191
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2667
01:09:16.191 --> 01:09:17.900
<v Speaker 2>But no one loves women more than me.</v>

2668
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:19.130
<v Speaker 2>My house is filled with women.</v>

2669
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:20.540
<v Speaker 2>My daughters are all women.</v>

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.473
<v Speaker 2>I love women.</v>

2673
01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.200
<v Speaker 2>I just don't,</v>

2674
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.470
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like I do girls ever.</v>

2675
01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:27.650
<v Speaker 2>My house has half pink,</v>

2676
01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:29.860
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like cons.</v>

2677
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:30.410
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

2678
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:31.101

2683
01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:39.920
<v Speaker 2>but it bears noting and re repeating.</v>

2684
01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that if you have a problem with guys,</v>

2685
01:09:43.101 --> 01:09:44.570
<v Speaker 2>nobody ever says you hate men.</v>

2686
01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2687
01:09:45.230 --> 01:09:45.920
<v Speaker 2>there's not even a,</v>

2688
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.880
<v Speaker 2>there is a word for it.</v>

2689
01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:47.870
<v Speaker 2>Because I brought this up once.</v>

2690
01:09:47.871 --> 01:09:48.111
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2691
01:09:48.111 --> 01:09:48.801
<v Speaker 2>there's no word.</v>

2692
01:09:48.801 --> 01:09:49.760
<v Speaker 2>I tried to write a joke about it.</v>

2693
01:09:49.761 --> 01:09:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2694
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2695
01:09:50.631 --> 01:09:52.190
<v Speaker 2>there's a word for hating women saw,</v>

2696
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.980
<v Speaker 2>but there's no word for hating men other than lesbian.</v>

2697
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:56.143
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2700
01:09:59.450 --> 01:10:00.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever the word is,</v>

2701
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:01.124
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows it.</v>

2702
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:03.440
<v Speaker 2>But the important thing is it's not respected.</v>

2703
01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:04.761
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing.</v>

2704
01:10:04.761 --> 01:10:07.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like when women are allowed to,</v>

2705
01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:07.570

2725
01:10:30.921 --> 01:10:32.870
<v Speaker 2>accident when I was in high school.</v>

01:10:37.351 --> 01:10:39.260
<v Speaker 2>He killed his buddy in a drunk driving accident.</v>

2733
01:10:39.261 --> 01:10:40.160
<v Speaker 2>It was devastating.</v>

2734
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.851
<v Speaker 2>And I remember,</v>

2736
01:10:41.631 --> 01:10:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Tim and I,</v>

2737
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.600
<v Speaker 2>we lived in the same neighborhood and I was walking down the street and it was</v>

2738
01:10:44.601 --> 01:10:45.830
<v Speaker 2>like a couple of weeks after it happened,</v>

2739
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:47.720
<v Speaker 2>he still had the marks all over his face.</v>

2740
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:49.060
<v Speaker 2>He was walking up the street.</v>

2741
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:50.270
<v Speaker 2>I was walking down the street.</v>

2742
01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I looked at him and I said,</v>

2743
01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:54.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2744
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:55.011
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2745
01:10:55.011 --> 01:10:55.700
<v Speaker 2>what's up to him?</v>

2746
01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:56.533
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2747
01:10:57.190 --> 01:10:59.200
<v Speaker 2>and he just walked past me and I,</v>

2748
01:10:59.260 --> 01:10:59.630
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2749
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.871
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2750
01:10:59.871 --> 01:11:04.871
<v Speaker 2>the fucking palpable feeling of sadness and regret and shame and horror.</v>

2751
01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:11.040
<v Speaker 2>And the story was he was drunk and he crashed his car and the cops were standing</v>

2752
01:11:11.721 --> 01:11:13.590
<v Speaker 2>over him when he woke up in the hospital</v>

2753
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.630
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>

2754
01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:16.830
<v Speaker 5>the cop said something,</v>

2755
01:11:16.831 --> 01:11:17.461
<v Speaker 5>something like,</v>

2756
01:11:17.461 --> 01:11:18.450
<v Speaker 5>congratulations.</v>

2757
01:11:18.451 --> 01:11:18.781
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

2758
01:11:18.781 --> 01:11:19.220
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2759
01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:19.650
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

2760
01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.720
<v Speaker 5>He goes and regulations that you killed your friend,</v>

2763
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:28.650
<v Speaker 5>So he tried to jump out the window and they grabbed him and stopped him from</v>

2764
01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:29.730
<v Speaker 5>trunk jumping out the window.</v>

2871
01:14:03.951 --> 01:14:04.620
<v Speaker 1>and sweat.</v>

01:14:20.051 --> 01:14:20.800
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2881
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Some dude's just,</v>

2882
01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:21.930
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2883
01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:22.170
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2884
01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:22.961
<v Speaker 2>they're born in this,</v>

2885
01:14:22.961 --> 01:14:25.840
<v Speaker 2>this crazy life with a weak hand.</v>

2886
01:14:26.050 --> 01:14:26.890
<v Speaker 2>Everything's week.</v>

2887
01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.120
<v Speaker 2>Their parents are weak.</v>

2888
01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Their genetics are weak,</v>

2889
01:14:29.321 --> 01:14:30.640
<v Speaker 2>their situations week or out,</v>

2890
01:14:30.641 --> 01:14:31.280
<v Speaker 2>it looks weak.</v>

2891
01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Their characters week,</v>

2892
01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:33.490
<v Speaker 2>their discipline is weak.</v>

2893
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:34.780
<v Speaker 2>They don't accomplish what they want.</v>

2894
01:14:34.781 --> 01:14:35.920
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the courage to go after.</v>

2895
01:14:35.921 --> 01:14:37.330
<v Speaker 2>They want what they want to achieve.</v>

2896
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:39.400
<v Speaker 2>That I'd ever become the man they wish they could be.</v>

2897
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:43.180
<v Speaker 2>So all they do along the way is try to define the boundaries for everybody else</v>

2898
01:14:43.181 --> 01:14:45.340
<v Speaker 2>and tell everybody else how they should think it should not behave.</v>

2899
01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:49.270
<v Speaker 2>And the guys that they hide behind unfortunately is a good one.</v>

2900
01:14:49.271 --> 01:14:50.920
<v Speaker 2>The guys that you should be a nice person.</v>

2901
01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:52.330
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be an asshole.</v>

2902
01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:53.051
<v Speaker 2>Hates women.</v>

2903
01:14:53.051 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2904
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:54.040
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>

2905
01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I've been around people that hate women.</v>

2906
01:14:55.391 --> 01:14:55.931
<v Speaker 2>It's an ugly,</v>

2907
01:14:55.931 --> 01:14:57.700
<v Speaker 2>ugly thing when you hate all women.</v>

2908
01:14:57.701 --> 01:14:58.990
<v Speaker 2>That's a really gross thing.</v>

2909
01:14:58.991 --> 01:15:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that at all.</v>

2910
01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.100
<v Speaker 2>We've got a lot of those fans on our podcast that you do.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's one of the greatest comedy performances of all.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He was claiming the Olympic weightlifting is like second to a soccer around the</v>

3001
01:17:29.931 --> 01:17:30.890
<v Speaker 4>world as a sport.</v>

3002
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:32.900
<v Speaker 4>And it's just not recognized really in America.</v>

3003
01:17:32.901 --> 01:17:35.360
<v Speaker 4>It's not a big sport in America and around the world.</v>

3004
01:17:35.361 --> 01:17:35.961
<v Speaker 4>It's massive.</v>

3005
01:17:35.961 --> 01:17:38.360
<v Speaker 4>Like in Russia and China,</v>

3006
01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.281
<v Speaker 4>China will,</v>

3007
01:17:39.281 --> 01:17:42.920
<v Speaker 4>there's 2 billion people in China and it's a fucking massive sport in China and</v>

3008
01:17:42.921 --> 01:17:43.191
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

3009
01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:45.680
<v Speaker 4>just wait till these fuckers get into crossfit.</v>

3010
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:46.251
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

3011
01:17:46.251 --> 01:17:48.760
<v Speaker 4>just wait cause they're there and it's all,</v>

3012
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:50.330
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking the same thing with MMA.</v>

3013
01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.313
<v Speaker 4>I mean are they,</v>

3014
01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.520
<v Speaker 4>do they have a history because,</v>

3015
01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:53.810
<v Speaker 4>because China also,</v>

3016
01:17:53.811 --> 01:17:54.650
<v Speaker 4>the way they,</v>

3017
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:57.680
<v Speaker 4>they put money into a sport and they like pull you out of your life.</v>

3018
01:17:57.710 --> 01:17:57.891
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3019
01:17:57.891 --> 01:17:59.720
<v Speaker 4>it's Kinda like Russia used to and they're like,</v>

3020
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.720
<v Speaker 4>you are going to be a javelin thrower.</v>

3021
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:04.510
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're going to do for the rest of you.</v>

3022
01:18:04.511 --> 01:18:06.080
<v Speaker 4>You are going to be known as a javelin thrower.</v>

3023
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.790
<v Speaker 4>Like if,</v>

3024
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.150
<v Speaker 4>if they start doing the same kind of thing with MMA where it's like they're</v>

3025
01:18:11.151 --> 01:18:14.210
<v Speaker 4>taking young kids that look like they have the size to build the speed,</v>

3026
01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:15.290
<v Speaker 4>everything and going,</v>

3027
01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:16.180
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

3028
01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:16.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3029
01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:17.071
<v Speaker 4>here we go.</v>

3030
01:18:17.071 --> 01:18:17.960
<v Speaker 4>Have time to train you.</v>

3031
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:19.220
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't always work though.</v>

3032
01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:19.761
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

3033
01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:22.190
<v Speaker 4>The funny thing is it's like giving someone welfare.</v>

3034
01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:24.410
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times you got to have the drive yourself.</v>

3035
01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:24.621
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3036
01:18:24.621 --> 01:18:24.981
<v Speaker 4>You got it.</v>

3037
01:18:24.981 --> 01:18:25.681
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes the,</v>

3038
01:18:25.681 --> 01:18:30.540
<v Speaker 4>the guys who make it through like having shitty jobs and getting to the top</v>

3039
01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:30.771
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

3040
01:18:30.771 --> 01:18:32.720
<v Speaker 4>So like Anderson Silva worked at Mcdonald's.</v>

3041
01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:33.913
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3042
01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:34.980
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3043
01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:36.270
<v Speaker 1>there's something about that,</v>

3044
01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:36.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3045
01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones was a bouncer with a,</v>

3046
01:18:38.770 --> 01:18:41.310
<v Speaker 1>a young girlfriend who with a child,</v>

3047
01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:41.970
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3048
01:18:41.970 --> 01:18:42.803
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3049
01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:46.590
<v Speaker 1>That's why that dude like gutted it up and became warrior.</v>

3050
01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3051
01:18:47.130 --> 01:18:47.790
<v Speaker 1>But it's true.</v>

3052
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the real story.</v>

3053
01:18:48.751 --> 01:18:51.020
<v Speaker 1>John has two children and that's what he would,</v>

3054
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:52.350
<v Speaker 1>that's why he dropped out of it</v>

3055
01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:52.741
<v Speaker 4>college.</v>

3056
01:18:52.741 --> 01:18:54.360
<v Speaker 4>He was going to wrestle for Iowa.</v>

3057
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:55.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3058
01:18:55.201 --> 01:18:55.430
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3059
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:56.263
<v Speaker 4>but if,</v>

3060
01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:58.840
<v Speaker 4>if you gave them like more of a,</v>

3061
01:18:58.841 --> 01:18:59.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3062
01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:01.920
<v Speaker 4>like a foundation as a young kid,</v>

3063
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:04.710
<v Speaker 4>let's say they had it as a kid and they weren't,</v>

3064
01:19:04.890 --> 01:19:05.810
<v Speaker 4>they weren't pushed into it,</v>

3065
01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:08.490
<v Speaker 4>but they were doing it a lot younger at w what age do kids start?</v>

3066
01:19:08.491 --> 01:19:09.430
<v Speaker 4>Like a damage?</v>

3067
01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:09.810
<v Speaker 4>It too.</v>

3068
01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:10.950
<v Speaker 4>Some of them start really young.</v>

3069
01:19:10.951 --> 01:19:11.460
<v Speaker 4>Some stuff,</v>

3070
01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:12.870
<v Speaker 4>four or five really.</v>

3071
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:16.380
<v Speaker 4>Somebody told me it's not good to have a kid do it cause they don't have the uh,</v>

3072
01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:17.543
<v Speaker 4>the cognitive,</v>

3073
01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:20.030
<v Speaker 1>a two year olds and my four year old choke each other.</v>

3074
01:19:20.031 --> 01:19:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I teach them that chose each other.</v>

3075
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:24.680
<v Speaker 1>I teach them how to tap out cause they knew.</v>

3076
01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:26.600
<v Speaker 1>They naturally start wrestling on the yeah.</v>

3077
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:27.740
<v Speaker 1>So while the rest of them on the bed,</v>

3078
01:19:27.741 --> 01:19:30.560
<v Speaker 1>I teach them what this is I control and this is how you get out of the guard.</v>

3079
01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.140
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be here because he or she can control you.</v>

3080
01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I teach them really young so this is a part of their,</v>

3081
01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:36.561
<v Speaker 1>their way,</v>

3082
01:19:36.561 --> 01:19:37.670
<v Speaker 1>their body's moving.</v>

3083
01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Like what if you see my two year old and my four year old,</v>

3084
01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:44.360
<v Speaker 1>they have Jiu Jitsu matches my two year old Mount Sir and my four year old hip</v>

3085
01:19:44.361 --> 01:19:46.370
<v Speaker 1>escapes and she'll pull guard.</v>

3086
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:48.170
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking pretty wild to see.</v>

3087
01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.050
<v Speaker 1>But it's just from showing them little natural moves.</v>

3088
01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't teach them how to finish each other but they do anyway.</v>

3089
01:19:53.451 --> 01:19:54.320
<v Speaker 1>They choke each other.</v>

3090
01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Especially the two year old,</v>

3091
01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:56.600
<v Speaker 1>the two year old,</v>

3092
01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:01.400
<v Speaker 1>she favors a fade or a million encode style rear naked choke where she grips</v>

3093
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:03.440
<v Speaker 1>like this and pulls it across the trake.</v>

3094
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:04.690
<v Speaker 1>She likes to trick,</v>

3095
01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:05.533
<v Speaker 1>choke you.</v>

3096
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't go for like the Jujitsu leverage.</v>

3097
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Once she,</v>

3098
01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:11.850
<v Speaker 3>she goes for a real nasty catch lock sort of choke</v>

3099
01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.393
<v Speaker 3>is cats.</v>

3100
01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:16.470
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

3101
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:17.303
<v Speaker 3>it's natural.</v>

3102
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:17.941
<v Speaker 3>It's natural.</v>

3103
01:20:17.941 --> 01:20:21.600
<v Speaker 3>The kids roll around and play together and teach them how to get into better</v>

3104
01:20:21.601 --> 01:20:22.210
<v Speaker 3>positions.</v>

3105
01:20:22.210 --> 01:20:23.970
<v Speaker 3>That's another reason I wouldn't do Jujitsu.</v>

3106
01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:24.973
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3107
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I used to when I was a kid,</v>

3108
01:20:27.511 --> 01:20:29.190
<v Speaker 3>when guys would like wrestle in the pool.</v>

3109
01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:32.310
<v Speaker 3>I hated that because I always had this like fear,</v>

3110
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:37.020
<v Speaker 3>like I surf a lot and when I get hold downs it makes me go fucking like,</v>

3111
01:20:37.021 --> 01:20:37.860
<v Speaker 3>I gotta go sit.</v>

3112
01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:42.940
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about that guy that got killed recently in South Africa?</v>

3113
01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:44.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3114
01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I've surfed down there.</v>

3115
01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:48.060
<v Speaker 3>You ever Seen Sharks while you're surfing?</v>

3116
01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:52.320
<v Speaker 3>The other day I was surfing and I went to a duck dive under a wave.</v>

3117
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.680
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

3118
01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.960
<v Speaker 3>and it was about four to six feet or something.</v>

3119
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:57.790
<v Speaker 3>I go to duck dive and you ducked out,</v>

3120
01:20:58.010 --> 01:21:00.330
<v Speaker 3>you dip your board below you so it doesn't,</v>

3121
01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:04.430
<v Speaker 3>the wave doesn't catch it and then you go kind of under the wave and the waves</v>

3122
01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:09.440
<v Speaker 3>coming up on me in the face of the wave and I just see a fucking giant fish</v>

3123
01:21:10.050 --> 01:21:11.940
<v Speaker 3>shoot across in front of me.</v>

3124
01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:16.900
<v Speaker 3>So it's like pulling away from me and all I can do is rather than like continue</v>

3125
01:21:16.901 --> 01:21:17.521
<v Speaker 3>my duck dive,</v>

3126
01:21:17.521 --> 01:21:20.010
<v Speaker 3>which would have been probably the smartest thing to do,</v>

3127
01:21:20.490 --> 01:21:23.130
<v Speaker 3>I lifted like back then,</v>

3128
01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.460
<v Speaker 3>thus like throwing me into a back flip like the board May,</v>

3129
01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.131
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

3130
01:21:27.131 --> 01:21:28.170
<v Speaker 3>like board first,</v>

3131
01:21:28.171 --> 01:21:29.520
<v Speaker 3>then my legs back over,</v>

3132
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:29.941
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

3133
01:21:29.941 --> 01:21:30.121
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

3134
01:21:30.121 --> 01:21:30.421
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

3135
01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:31.980
<v Speaker 3>Like getting held down.</v>

3136
01:21:31.981 --> 01:21:33.330
<v Speaker 3>You know what is a duck dive?</v>

3137
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:38.220
<v Speaker 3>You pushed the board under the nose of the board under the wave and so that the</v>

3138
01:21:38.221 --> 01:21:40.620
<v Speaker 3>wave goes over you and doesn't take you with it.</v>

3139
01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.300
<v Speaker 3>You actually don't take the force of the wave and you get through the wave and</v>

3140
01:21:45.301 --> 01:21:46.230
<v Speaker 3>you end up on the other side.</v>

3141
01:21:46.231 --> 01:21:47.310
<v Speaker 3>This is on your paddle out.</v>

3142
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:47.951
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3143
01:21:47.951 --> 01:21:48.271
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>

3144
01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:48.541
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>

3145
01:21:48.541 --> 01:21:48.960
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

3146
01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:52.140
<v Speaker 3>So as I'm about to duck dive through it on the face of the wave,</v>

3147
01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:53.160
<v Speaker 3>I see the fish go,</v>

3148
01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:55.260
<v Speaker 3>how big,</v>

3149
01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:55.830
<v Speaker 3>how many feet?</v>

3150
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:59.610
<v Speaker 3>It must've been like four or five feet and I went away from you or long long.</v>

3151
01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:01.470
<v Speaker 3>And I just went ah,</v>

3152
01:22:01.471 --> 01:22:03.690
<v Speaker 3>and went backwards and flip.</v>

3153
01:22:03.691 --> 01:22:06.600
<v Speaker 3>Then as I'm getting tumbled in the Whitewater and going through the wash,</v>

3154
01:22:06.601 --> 01:22:07.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm like fuck,</v>

3155
01:22:07.831 --> 01:22:08.490
<v Speaker 3>like I'm,</v>

3156
01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:10.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting held down so no breath.</v>

3157
01:22:10.531 --> 01:22:11.131
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like fuck,</v>

3158
01:22:11.131 --> 01:22:14.820
<v Speaker 3>trying to get to the surface so I can start swimming as fast as I can.</v>

3159
01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:16.043
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3160
01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.160
<v Speaker 3>I pull up and I looked back to see if I see a fin or something and it's a seal</v>

3161
01:22:20.610 --> 01:22:21.443
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>

3162
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:22.830
<v Speaker 3>it's like laughing at me.</v>

3163
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:24.960
<v Speaker 3>I caught a seal once accidentally.</v>

3164
01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:25.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3165
01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.380
<v Speaker 3>I cut the line when I saw was a CEO.</v>

3166
01:22:27.381 --> 01:22:29.200
<v Speaker 3>We're were fishing and uh,</v>

3167
01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:29.701
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

3168
01:22:29.701 --> 01:22:32.730
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what we're trying to catch when we were fishing with bait also on the</v>

3169
01:22:32.731 --> 01:22:33.391
<v Speaker 3>line poles.</v>

3170
01:22:33.391 --> 01:22:35.280
<v Speaker 3>Big giant fish.</v>

3171
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:35.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3172
01:22:35.401 --> 01:22:36.234
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking big.</v>

3173
01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:36.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3174
01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:37.440
<v Speaker 3>it's a seal.</v>

3175
01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.540
<v Speaker 3>But I've seen a of sucks though.</v>

3176
01:22:39.541 --> 01:22:40.380
<v Speaker 3>You feel like shit,</v>

3177
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:42.780
<v Speaker 3>it'd be terrible to sketch burger king.</v>

3178
01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.450
<v Speaker 3>What is it as a seal or a sea lion?</v>

3179
01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:46.981
<v Speaker 3>What do they see?</v>

3180
01:22:46.981 --> 01:22:47.580
<v Speaker 3>Lines or see,</v>

3181
01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:48.720
<v Speaker 3>I think there are two different things.</v>

3182
01:22:49.890 --> 01:22:51.930
<v Speaker 3>The things that you see off of California,</v>

3183
01:22:51.931 --> 01:22:52.141
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3184
01:22:52.141 --> 01:22:53.580
<v Speaker 3>Aren't they see sea lions?</v>

3185
01:22:53.581 --> 01:22:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3186
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:54.031
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3187
01:22:54.031 --> 01:22:55.950
<v Speaker 3>but I think what I saw the other day was a seal.</v>

3188
01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it was a seal.</v>

3189
01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.290
<v Speaker 3>You know what's really fucked up,</v>

3190
01:22:58.291 --> 01:22:58.561
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

3191
01:22:58.561 --> 01:22:59.730
<v Speaker 3>Those leopard seals.</v>

3192
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:01.260
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen those things?</v>

3193
01:23:01.261 --> 01:23:02.580
<v Speaker 3>See Leopard sharks all the time?</v>

3194
01:23:02.850 --> 01:23:03.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3195
01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:04.530
<v Speaker 3>Leopard seal is like,</v>

3196
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem like a real animal.</v>

3197
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Leopard seal seems like something from Star Wars.</v>

3198
01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:13.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a seal that's super predatory and as giant teeth and it's fucking hugely,</v>

3199
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:13.951
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3200
01:23:13.951 --> 01:23:14.890
<v Speaker 2>it was in that movie,</v>

3201
01:23:14.891 --> 01:23:15.724
<v Speaker 2>happy feet.</v>

3202
01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:16.511
<v Speaker 2>It was like the,</v>

3203
01:23:16.511 --> 01:23:16.631
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3204
01:23:16.631 --> 01:23:17.770
<v Speaker 2>the enemy in the movie.</v>

3205
01:23:17.771 --> 01:23:18.604
<v Speaker 2>Happy feet.</v>

3206
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:20.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I found out about it.</v>

3207
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Real.</v>

3208
01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3209
01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:22.420
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3210
01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:22.841
<v Speaker 2>Or it was,</v>

3211
01:23:22.841 --> 01:23:22.931
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3212
01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:23.820
<v Speaker 2>was it happy feeder was,</v>

3213
01:23:23.821 --> 01:23:24.011
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3214
01:23:24.011 --> 01:23:26.170
<v Speaker 2>it was the actual march of the penguins.</v>

3215
01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:28.210
<v Speaker 2>It was actually march of the penguins because,</v>

3216
01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:28.361
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3217
01:23:28.361 --> 01:23:28.810
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3218
01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:29.361
<v Speaker 2>that's their,</v>

3219
01:23:29.361 --> 01:23:30.190
<v Speaker 2>their main enemy.</v>

3220
01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:31.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what leopard seals eat.</v>

3221
01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Penguins.</v>

3222
01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:34.180
<v Speaker 2>That's like their main food.</v>

3223
01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:35.650
<v Speaker 2>They're so scary.</v>

3224
01:23:35.651 --> 01:23:36.550
<v Speaker 2>They kill people.</v>

3225
01:23:36.670 --> 01:23:38.910
<v Speaker 2>They've killed people that they recently killed a photographer,</v>

3226
01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:40.330
<v Speaker 2>someone that got attacked and mauled.</v>

3227
01:23:40.331 --> 01:23:40.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3228
01:23:40.481 --> 01:23:41.314
<v Speaker 2>There's all kinds of things.</v>

3229
01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I've got clients or photography,</v>

3230
01:23:42.731 --> 01:23:43.750
<v Speaker 2>lazy stories of a Dolphin.</v>

3231
01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:44.650
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a,</v>

3232
01:23:44.651 --> 01:23:45.760
<v Speaker 2>have you ever seen a leopard seal?</v>

3233
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>

3234
01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:46.460
<v Speaker 2>I've never told him.</v>

3235
01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Pull up a photo man.</v>

3236
01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:47.650
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda,</v>

3237
01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:48.371
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of freaky.</v>

3238
01:23:48.371 --> 01:23:51.550
<v Speaker 2>I had the shark alarm went off on me in Bondai Australia.</v>

3239
01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:51.881
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>

3240
01:23:51.881 --> 01:23:52.714
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

3241
01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm surfing and all of a sudden I hear</v>

3242
01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:56.853
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

3243
01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:57.520
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3244
01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:01.300
<v Speaker 2>And I just start looking around and every surfer's paddling out of the water.</v>

3245
01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:02.800
<v Speaker 2>And so my heart started beating.</v>

3246
01:24:02.801 --> 01:24:04.480
<v Speaker 2>I start paddling as fast as I can,</v>

3247
01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:06.700
<v Speaker 2>and I'm thinking it's probably a regular current.</v>

3248
01:24:06.730 --> 01:24:08.680
<v Speaker 2>I've surfed in Australia probably a hundred times.</v>

3249
01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3250
01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:10.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3251
01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:12.130
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of shark alarm,</v>

3252
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:14.680
<v Speaker 2>but maybe this is a common thing on a crowded beach.</v>

3253
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:15.850
<v Speaker 2>So I started paddling.</v>

3254
01:24:15.851 --> 01:24:18.010
<v Speaker 2>I look over at the guy next to me and I go,</v>

3255
01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:18.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3256
01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.980
<v Speaker 2>and just to see what his reaction is.</v>

3257
01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.193
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

3258
01:24:23.290 --> 01:24:24.040
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

3259
01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:24.910
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

3260
01:24:24.911 --> 01:24:25.840
<v Speaker 2>that's so scary.</v>

3261
01:24:25.841 --> 01:24:27.130
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't even look real.</v>

3262
01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:27.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3263
01:24:27.701 --> 01:24:28.870
<v Speaker 2>that does look scary.</v>

3264
01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:32.230
<v Speaker 2>The one of them click on the one with the big mouth because most people can't</v>

3265
01:24:32.231 --> 01:24:33.040
<v Speaker 2>see what the fuck that is.</v>

3266
01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:33.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3267
01:24:33.221 --> 01:24:34.054
<v Speaker 2>that one in the center.</v>

3268
01:24:34.090 --> 01:24:35.200
<v Speaker 2>That does look scary.</v>

3269
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:37.090
<v Speaker 2>Looking at those fucking teeth,</v>

3270
01:24:37.091 --> 01:24:38.320
<v Speaker 2>that shit is ridiculous.</v>

3271
01:24:38.650 --> 01:24:40.090
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like a real animal.</v>

3272
01:24:40.091 --> 01:24:41.090
<v Speaker 2>That's what's weird about it.</v>

3273
01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:44.200
<v Speaker 2>It seems like some something that someone invented in a movie.</v>

3274
01:24:44.290 --> 01:24:46.360
<v Speaker 2>Well a seal that the,</v>

3275
01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.373
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

3276
01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:48.461
<v Speaker 2>the alarms going off.</v>

3277
01:24:48.461 --> 01:24:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I look at this dude and I go,</v>

3278
01:24:49.541 --> 01:24:50.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3279
01:24:50.230 --> 01:24:51.220
<v Speaker 2>I look at him and he goes,</v>

3280
01:24:51.230 --> 01:24:52.900
<v Speaker 2>haven't heard that in a long time.</v>

3281
01:24:53.410 --> 01:24:54.430
<v Speaker 2>So I just start paddling.</v>

3282
01:24:54.431 --> 01:24:56.890
<v Speaker 2>It was like when you think you'd like fly out of the water,</v>

3283
01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:58.780
<v Speaker 2>it just seemed like an eternity,</v>

3284
01:24:58.930 --> 01:24:59.261
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

3285
01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:01.240
<v Speaker 2>And then I got out and they said somebody,</v>

3286
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:04.480
<v Speaker 2>somebody called and said they spotted like a four foot shark or something and</v>

3287
01:25:04.481 --> 01:25:06.100
<v Speaker 2>they have to get you out of the water.</v>

3288
01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:06.731
<v Speaker 2>But they're out there.</v>

3289
01:25:06.731 --> 01:25:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Like I've pictures a guy that owns horizon surf shop in Santa Monica,</v>

3290
01:25:10.751 --> 01:25:12.130

3291
01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.200
<v Speaker 2>the end where sunset comes out to the PCH,</v>

3292
01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:15.520
<v Speaker 2>a fucking giant,</v>

3293
01:25:15.521 --> 01:25:17.440
<v Speaker 2>great white breaching right there.</v>

3294
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:18.281

01:25:18.281 --> 01:25:18.821
<v Speaker 2>And My iPhone.</v>

3297
01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Please show it to me and I've gone down where that guy died last week.</v>

3298
01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.400
<v Speaker 2>That's in Cape Town.</v>

3299
01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.421
<v Speaker 2>I've gone there.</v>

3300
01:25:25.421 --> 01:25:28.960
<v Speaker 2>I went down in the cage with the great whites and saw them.</v>

3301
01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:30.730
<v Speaker 2>I would never surf there.</v>

3302
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:31.833
<v Speaker 2>I know it's crazy.</v>

3303
01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:36.490
<v Speaker 2>There's only like five deaths a year worldwide from sharks and three of them are</v>

3304
01:25:36.491 --> 01:25:36.940
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3305
01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:38.230
<v Speaker 2>South Africa's fucking,</v>

3306
01:25:38.231 --> 01:25:39.240
<v Speaker 2>they're all over the,</v>

3307
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:42.400
<v Speaker 2>they happen here to the Santa Barbara Guy got killed just two years ago.</v>

3308
01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Even seriously five people a year.</v>

3309
01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean more people died by dogs in California here,</v>

3310
01:25:48.071 --> 01:25:48.611
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

3311
01:25:48.611 --> 01:25:52.660
<v Speaker 2>You don't think how few people are in the fucking ocean tiny number and you look</v>

3312
01:25:52.661 --> 01:25:52.841
<v Speaker 2>at it.</v>

3313
01:25:52.841 --> 01:25:54.100
<v Speaker 2>If the whole world was in the ocean,</v>

3314
01:25:54.101 --> 01:25:55.090
<v Speaker 2>God dammit dude,</v>

3315
01:25:55.091 --> 01:25:57.760
<v Speaker 2>it would be a thousand deaths if you can find it.</v>

3316
01:25:57.761 --> 01:25:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Some guy,</v>

3317
01:25:58.660 --> 01:25:59.560
<v Speaker 2>they talked about your odds.</v>

3318
01:25:59.561 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like one in 7 million are worth 700 billion of attacked by sharp.</v>

3319
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:07.250
<v Speaker 3>Some guy did the odds then like he said,</v>

3320
01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.360
<v Speaker 3>if you're wearing a wetsuit,</v>

3321
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.691
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3322
01:26:08.691 --> 01:26:09.950
<v Speaker 3>you look more like a seal.</v>

3323
01:26:10.190 --> 01:26:11.560
<v Speaker 3>If you're on a surfboard,</v>

3324
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:12.950
<v Speaker 3>it looks more like a fish.</v>

3325
01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.760
<v Speaker 3>So if you're by a river mouth where there they go to feed,</v>

3326
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:18.200
<v Speaker 3>you're increasing your chances.</v>

3327
01:26:18.201 --> 01:26:19.280
<v Speaker 3>If you're alone,</v>

3328
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:20.143
<v Speaker 3>you're increasing your,</v>

3329
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:23.140
<v Speaker 3>he does the odds and increases a cha and it's,</v>

3330
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:24.080
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking not,</v>

3331
01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.510
<v Speaker 3>it's like one in 10,000 La,</v>

3332
01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:30.230
<v Speaker 3>one in like 5,000 and this guy met.</v>

3333
01:26:30.231 --> 01:26:31.850
<v Speaker 3>So like I surf every,</v>

3334
01:26:31.851 --> 01:26:34.010
<v Speaker 3>but like I've gone through logical man,</v>

3335
01:26:34.011 --> 01:26:35.720
<v Speaker 3>whoever you are it where they go,</v>

3336
01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:37.310

3343
01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:43.270

3345
01:26:46.731 --> 01:26:51.410
<v Speaker 3>island in Australia where we had to swim across the shark pit to get to the</v>

3346
01:26:51.411 --> 01:26:52.244
<v Speaker 3>break.</v>

3347
01:26:52.270 --> 01:26:52.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3348
01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:56.000
<v Speaker 3>We just swim across the shark pit where the guys I was surfing with had seen a</v>

3349
01:26:56.001 --> 01:26:59.540
<v Speaker 3>great white and they told me about how they got off and got out of the water and</v>

3350
01:26:59.541 --> 01:27:00.800
<v Speaker 3>they'd climb up on the rocks.</v>

3351
01:27:01.230 --> 01:27:01.731
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:19.940
<v Speaker 3>But then it's fun.</v>

3425
01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.113
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>

3426
01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:23.180
<v Speaker 3>I hang out with Brazilians in Australia.</v>

3427
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:26.690
<v Speaker 3>And it's funny because there's kind of like an Australian Brazilian kind of</v>

3428
01:28:26.691 --> 01:28:28.260
<v Speaker 3>clash and there is,</v>

3429
01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:28.841
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3430
01:28:28.841 --> 01:28:29.030
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3431
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.660
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3432
01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:30.040
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3433
01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:30.870
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

3434
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:34.970
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of Brazilians come to Australia and then they surf and they're</v>

3435
01:28:34.971 --> 01:28:38.600
<v Speaker 3>kind of aggressive and there's a whole like culture clash between the two of</v>

3436
01:28:38.601 --> 01:28:38.990
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3437
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:40.760
<v Speaker 3>But I thought of aggression on the beach,</v>

3438
01:28:40.761 --> 01:28:41.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3439
01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:41.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3440
01:28:41.341 --> 01:28:41.501
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3441
01:28:41.501 --> 01:28:41.781
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3442
01:28:41.781 --> 01:28:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Like supposedly like I serve Venice breakwater every day,</v>

3443
01:28:45.351 --> 01:28:48.080
<v Speaker 3>which is supposed to be legendary for,</v>

3444
01:28:48.230 --> 01:28:50.090
<v Speaker 3>for all this fucking crazy,</v>

3445
01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:51.680
<v Speaker 3>a localism.</v>

3446
01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:56.740
<v Speaker 3>And I've probably had like three or four incidents in my life where we've almost</v>

3447
01:28:56.991 --> 01:28:58.220
<v Speaker 3>gotten out of the water and fought,</v>

3448
01:28:58.280 --> 01:28:59.031
<v Speaker 3>this is my friend,</v>

3449
01:28:59.031 --> 01:29:00.680
<v Speaker 3>you need to take some Jujitsu.</v>

3450
01:29:00.730 --> 01:29:01.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3451
01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.220

3452
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:05.510
<v Speaker 1>friends sit down with you and just show you basic position.</v>

3453
01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:08.790
<v Speaker 1>One Dude was fucking give me shit one day and all I did was he goes,</v>

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.890
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna beat the fuck out of me?</v>

3460
01:29:13.891 --> 01:29:14.161

3472
01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:22.710
<v Speaker 1>You Bitch.</v>

3473
01:29:22.710 --> 01:29:23.400
<v Speaker 1>And he went,</v>

3474
01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.090
<v Speaker 1>he went,</v>

3475
01:29:24.090 --> 01:29:24.923
<v Speaker 1>he went,</v>

3476
01:29:25.190 --> 01:29:26.023
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3477
01:29:26.210 --> 01:29:27.043
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3478
01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:27.780
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3479
01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:28.350
<v Speaker 1>So silly.</v>

3480
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:31.410
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work like that off duty cops don't have like some sort of a special</v>

3481
01:29:31.411 --> 01:29:32.490
<v Speaker 1>license to be cons,</v>

3482
01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:33.200
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3483
01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:33.751
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

3484
01:29:33.751 --> 01:29:34.950
<v Speaker 1>he was being the current.</v>

3485
01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:35.730
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

3486
01:29:35.730 --> 01:29:37.590
<v Speaker 1>there's some locals that just fucking take it like,</v>

3487
01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:38.330
<v Speaker 1>hey sure he was,</v>

3488
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is our fucking area.</v>

3489
01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:40.530
<v Speaker 1>You can't surf here.</v>

3490
01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:41.400
<v Speaker 1>That's so silly.</v>

3491
01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:43.740
<v Speaker 1>But I was as a cop ever done that.</v>

3492
01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I've never personally had a problem ever in Australia though with like</v>

3493
01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Australians are totally cool about like,</v>

3494
01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:49.981
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3495
01:29:49.981 --> 01:29:51.180
<v Speaker 1>it's more of an American thing.</v>

3496
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:54.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the localism I've seen in American way works.</v>

3497
01:29:54.930 --> 01:29:55.381
<v Speaker 1>Why is it,</v>

3498
01:29:55.381 --> 01:29:57.000
<v Speaker 1>is it because there's a shortage of waves?</v>

3499
01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:57.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3500
01:29:57.391 --> 01:30:00.840
<v Speaker 1>there's totally a shortage waves and because everything's on the computer now,</v>

3501
01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:02.160
<v Speaker 1>like there's all these sites,</v>

3502
01:30:02.161 --> 01:30:03.420
<v Speaker 1>it'll tell you where the good waves are.</v>

3503
01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has gone to the same places and so really only one person can catch a</v>

3504
01:30:08.671 --> 01:30:09.210
<v Speaker 1>wave.</v>

3505
01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Does it easier to learn how to surf now though?</v>

3506
01:30:11.341 --> 01:30:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Like cause you can kinda like get lessons online.</v>

3507
01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Are there more people surfing?</v>

3508
01:30:15.850 --> 01:30:20.100
<v Speaker 1>It's somebody just twittered me today and said tell Jody of Kelly Slater on the</v>

3509
01:30:20.101 --> 01:30:20.640
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

3510
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:20.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3511
01:30:20.821 --> 01:30:21.511
<v Speaker 1>I met Kelly.</v>

3512
01:30:21.511 --> 01:30:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed him at one of the UFC is really,</v>

3513
01:30:23.791 --> 01:30:24.780
<v Speaker 1>he loves you if say,</v>

3514
01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:25.081
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3515
01:30:25.081 --> 01:30:27.990
<v Speaker 1>he's a good friends with Bj Penn and he trains too.</v>

3516
01:30:28.050 --> 01:30:28.350
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3517
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:32.130
<v Speaker 1>that's Bj Penn I think is the one that did the crossfit workout.</v>

3518
01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.410
<v Speaker 1>That named it fight gone bad.</v>

3519
01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:34.350
<v Speaker 1>That might be who it was.</v>

3520
01:30:34.351 --> 01:30:35.101
<v Speaker 1>It probably makes sense.</v>

3521
01:30:35.101 --> 01:30:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3522
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3523
01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3524
01:30:36.150 --> 01:30:36.983
<v Speaker 1>Bj,</v>

3525
01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Bj apparently is thinking about making a comeback.</v>

3526
01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:42.300
<v Speaker 1>He decided to take a lot of time off after the Nick Diaz fight,</v>

3527
01:30:42.301 --> 01:30:43.710
<v Speaker 1>but apparently the,</v>

3528
01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:45.630
<v Speaker 1>the rumor is that,</v>

3529
01:30:45.631 --> 01:30:45.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3530
01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Dana talked to him.</v>

3531
01:30:46.711 --> 01:30:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I haven't spoken to day and a couple of days,</v>

3532
01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:49.950
<v Speaker 1>but Dana talked to him and he said he wants to fight.</v>

3533
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.880
<v Speaker 1>That'd be awesome.</v>

3534
01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.560
<v Speaker 1>That'd be nice if he wants to,</v>

3535
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:53.730
<v Speaker 1>if he actually wants to,</v>

3536
01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:54.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3537
01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:55.770
<v Speaker 1>but if he's not motivated,</v>

3538
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:56.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3539
01:30:56.110 --> 01:30:58.560
<v Speaker 1>there's two Bj's is Bj the world beaters,</v>

3540
01:30:58.561 --> 01:31:00.060
<v Speaker 1>like one of the greatest fighters of all time.</v>

3541
01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:03.480
<v Speaker 1>And then there's unmotivated Bj who just doesn't find as well.</v>

3542
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really that simple.</v>

3543
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:05.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like Tyson after,</v>

3544
01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard,</v>

3545
01:31:07.111 --> 01:31:07.670
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3546
01:31:07.670 --> 01:31:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Bj has been at the top for so long.</v>

3547
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:12.410
<v Speaker 1>You know how hard it must be to try to keep the motivation up to,</v>

3548
01:31:12.630 --> 01:31:13.740
<v Speaker 1>to train so hard.</v>

3549
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Your body,</v>

3550
01:31:14.130 --> 01:31:15.600
<v Speaker 1>any supernatural too.</v>

3551
01:31:15.601 --> 01:31:16.171
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>

3552
01:31:16.171 --> 01:31:18.840
<v Speaker 1>he's not fucking around with growth or anything funky.</v>

3553
01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:19.350
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3554
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.710
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3555
01:31:19.710 --> 01:31:21.000
<v Speaker 1>he's 100% natural.</v>

3556
01:31:21.001 --> 01:31:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean it takes vitamins and supplements,</v>

3557
01:31:22.591 --> 01:31:26.130
<v Speaker 1>but he's not fucking around with anything that's going to aid in his recovery.</v>

3558
01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:29.760
<v Speaker 1>His motivation sucks because everyone else is probably doing that.</v>

3559
01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:33.420
<v Speaker 1>A lot of dudes do that Todd Duffy guy that we were talking about,</v>

3560
01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:36.090
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the youngest guys that's a got a,</v>

3561
01:31:36.091 --> 01:31:36.361
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

3562
01:31:36.361 --> 01:31:38.670
<v Speaker 1>an exemption for hormone replacement.</v>

3563
01:31:38.730 --> 01:31:39.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3564
01:31:39.001 --> 01:31:40.260
<v Speaker 1>in some guys have it,</v>

3565
01:31:40.290 --> 01:31:40.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3566
01:31:40.530 --> 01:31:42.630
<v Speaker 1>because of head trauma.</v>

3567
01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:43.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3568
01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.720
<v Speaker 1>some guys have hormone replacement because when you're,</v>

3569
01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:50.760
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a sport like football or boxing or MMA as well,</v>

3570
01:31:50.761 --> 01:31:52.200
<v Speaker 1>when you're getting tagged in the head,</v>

3571
01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:56.150
<v Speaker 1>it's very possible to damage the pituitary gland and the studies that they've</v>

3572
01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:57.140
<v Speaker 1>been doing on,</v>

3573
01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:57.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3574
01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:57.780
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

3575
01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:58.170
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

3576
01:31:58.170 --> 01:32:00.910
<v Speaker 1>on high level combat athletes,</v>

3577
01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:05.560
<v Speaker 1>those seem to indicate that there's a certain amount of head trauma will lead to</v>

3578
01:32:05.561 --> 01:32:07.180
<v Speaker 1>a drop in your testosterone,</v>

3579
01:32:07.181 --> 01:32:08.110
<v Speaker 1>a significant drop.</v>

3580
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:11.680
<v Speaker 1>And it's not from guys that abused it's guys that were clean.</v>

3581
01:32:11.710 --> 01:32:12.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>

3582
01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.750
<v Speaker 1>there's two ways to damage your system.</v>

3583
01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:13.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3584
01:32:13.871 --> 01:32:14.501
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of ways,</v>

3585
01:32:14.501 --> 01:32:15.850
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is that you can,</v>

3586
01:32:15.851 --> 01:32:16.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3587
01:32:16.121 --> 01:32:17.440
<v Speaker 1>disease obviously get damage you,</v>

3588
01:32:17.441 --> 01:32:18.310
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is,</v>

3589
01:32:18.311 --> 01:32:19.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3590
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:19.451
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

3591
01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:19.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3592
01:32:19.630 --> 01:32:22.210
<v Speaker 1>do steroids when you're young and you do a lot of steroids in your balls,</v>

3593
01:32:22.211 --> 01:32:22.850
<v Speaker 1>just quit.</v>

3594
01:32:22.850 --> 01:32:24.130
<v Speaker 1>You just shut them down and break them.</v>

3595
01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:25.720
<v Speaker 1>And so then you need hormones.</v>

3596
01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Literally they have to ingest.</v>

3597
01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:27.450
<v Speaker 1>These are strong.</v>

3598
01:32:27.450 --> 01:32:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3599
01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:28.301
<v Speaker 1>But those guys,</v>

3600
01:32:28.301 --> 01:32:30.520
<v Speaker 1>it's always like I'm stirred,</v>

3601
01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:31.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3602
01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:32.580
<v Speaker 1>crazy looking dudes,</v>

3603
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime type dudes where it's like there's no way to</v>

3604
01:32:35.981 --> 01:32:39.550
<v Speaker 1>achieve those levels without like completely jolting your body,</v>

3605
01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:40.451
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3606
01:32:40.451 --> 01:32:41.530
<v Speaker 1>So that's one way.</v>

3607
01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:42.580
<v Speaker 1>There's another way you could,</v>

3608
01:32:42.581 --> 01:32:46.480
<v Speaker 1>if you get bit by the resilient and wandering spider that kills your Dick shot</v>

3609
01:32:46.481 --> 01:32:47.210
<v Speaker 1>up forever.</v>

3610
01:32:47.210 --> 01:32:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Spider called the Brazilian wondering spider called a Brazilian wandering</v>

3611
01:32:51.551 --> 01:32:53.890
<v Speaker 1>spiders that when it stings you,</v>

3612
01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:59.040
<v Speaker 1>it gives you an unbelievably painful hard on where your body,</v>

3613
01:32:59.351 --> 01:33:01.750
<v Speaker 1>your dick is literally spliting like,</v>

3614
01:33:01.751 --> 01:33:05.110
<v Speaker 1>like a hot dog that you sliced and then put it on the grill.</v>

3615
01:33:05.170 --> 01:33:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3616
01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:06.311
<v Speaker 1>lumps.</v>

3617
01:33:06.311 --> 01:33:07.144
<v Speaker 1>When you cook it,</v>

3618
01:33:07.570 --> 01:33:09.040
<v Speaker 1>your whole body's in mass.</v>

3619
01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:10.563
<v Speaker 1>In the Amazon.</v>

3620
01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:13.360
<v Speaker 1>It's the most toxic spider known to man.</v>

3621
01:33:13.361 --> 01:33:13.811
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3622
01:33:13.811 --> 01:33:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3623
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:15.280
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't kill you,</v>

3624
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:17.830
<v Speaker 1>it breaks your Dick here that Australia,</v>

3625
01:33:17.831 --> 01:33:22.831
<v Speaker 1>they even have the fucking and that too because that's clearly,</v>

3626
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:23.850
<v Speaker 1>it's got some pretty bad ass.</v>

3627
01:33:23.851 --> 01:33:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Wider.</v>

3628
01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Australia is missing good drugs.</v>

3629
01:33:25.930 --> 01:33:26.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what Australia is missing.</v>

3630
01:33:27.010 --> 01:33:28.150
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the Iowasca there.</v>

3631
01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:28.993
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>

3632
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:30.550
<v Speaker 1>they have something similar.</v>

3633
01:33:30.551 --> 01:33:32.120
<v Speaker 1>There's an aboriginal uh,</v>

3634
01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Elixir that's,</v>

3635
01:33:33.231 --> 01:33:34.720
<v Speaker 1>it's just not nearly as common,</v>

3636
01:33:34.721 --> 01:33:37.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's very similar in the fact that it is a,</v>

3637
01:33:37.271 --> 01:33:39.280
<v Speaker 1>it's based on conduct.</v>

3638
01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:39.840
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3639
01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.380
<v Speaker 1>the two elements,</v>

3640
01:33:41.381 --> 01:33:44.540
<v Speaker 1>having a Mao inhibitor and having a,</v>

3641
01:33:44.541 --> 01:33:46.300
<v Speaker 1>a DMT that you can take orally.</v>

3642
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

3643
01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I haven't spent much time with like aboriginal people in Australia,</v>

3644
01:33:49.841 --> 01:33:52.960
<v Speaker 1>but my next trip over a and I go about twice a year,</v>

3645
01:33:53.010 --> 01:33:53.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3646
01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:57.010
<v Speaker 1>I've got a buddy who's decided he was a pro basketball player and he's,</v>

3647
01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.260
<v Speaker 1>he now has like his new thing,</v>

3648
01:33:59.261 --> 01:34:00.100
<v Speaker 1>he's filming documentary.</v>

3649
01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:00.934
<v Speaker 1>He's about,</v>

3650
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.890
<v Speaker 1>he goes way into the Bush,</v>

3651
01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:06.100
<v Speaker 1>into the fucking Bush and he's filming documentaries and I'm going to go with</v>

3652
01:34:06.101 --> 01:34:07.320
<v Speaker 1>them and kind of,</v>

3653
01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:10.990
<v Speaker 1>I've gone up to Darwin to the northern territory and just like kind of</v>

3654
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:13.720
<v Speaker 1>like looked around and stuff,</v>

3655
01:34:13.721 --> 01:34:15.420
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't gotten into it and I lost it.</v>

3656
01:34:15.730 --> 01:34:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Australia is a huge continent and as big as American,</v>

3657
01:34:18.551 --> 01:34:20.650
<v Speaker 1>but most of the people live along the coast,</v>

3658
01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:20.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3659
01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3660
01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:23.110
<v Speaker 1>There's only 20 million people like we have,</v>

3661
01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:23.681
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

3662
01:34:23.681 --> 01:34:24.491
<v Speaker 1>like 300 million?</v>

3663
01:34:24.491 --> 01:34:25.510
<v Speaker 1>They have like 20 million.</v>

3664
01:34:25.570 --> 01:34:26.021
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3665
01:34:26.021 --> 01:34:27.310
<v Speaker 1>And they all live around the coast.</v>

3666
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:28.210
<v Speaker 1>So great there.</v>

3667
01:34:28.210 --> 01:34:31.200
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing what a great fucking contrasts plays ever.</v>

3668
01:34:31.210 --> 01:34:31.601
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

3669
01:34:31.601 --> 01:34:32.500
<v Speaker 1>When we were in Sydney,</v>

3670
01:34:32.501 --> 01:34:33.334
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3671
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.761
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

3672
01:34:33.761 --> 01:34:34.594
<v Speaker 1>what did I say?</v>

3673
01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:35.501
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

3674
01:34:35.501 --> 01:34:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I would say if I was in Sydney,</v>

3675
01:34:36.650 --> 01:34:37.483
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3676
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:39.340
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't go into the bush.</v>

3677
01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:39.701
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3678
01:34:39.701 --> 01:34:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I would say I could live there.</v>

3679
01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Great place to me because everywhere we go,</v>

3680
01:34:43.841 --> 01:34:44.231
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

3681
01:34:44.231 --> 01:34:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Like when we were in Atlanta,</v>

3682
01:34:45.431 --> 01:34:45.820
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3683
01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:47.080
<v Speaker 1>well you sit and I only say it,</v>

3684
01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:48.640
<v Speaker 1>but you'd like to be on the radio station that morning.</v>

3685
01:34:48.641 --> 01:34:48.881
<v Speaker 1>We like,</v>

3686
01:34:48.881 --> 01:34:51.480
<v Speaker 1>I think I might live here fairly seriously.</v>

3687
01:34:51.481 --> 01:34:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Head problems convincing.</v>

3688
01:34:54.161 --> 01:34:54.701
<v Speaker 1>Mrs Rogan,</v>

3689
01:34:54.701 --> 01:34:55.540
<v Speaker 1>obviously I moved,</v>

3690
01:34:55.541 --> 01:34:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I moved to Colorado.</v>

3691
01:34:56.441 --> 01:34:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I was ready to,</v>

3692
01:34:57.190 --> 01:34:58.023
<v Speaker 1>how'd you read</v>

3693
01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.631

3694
01:34:59.631 --> 01:35:00.380
<v Speaker 3>I want to know that.</v>

3695
01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Why you went to the Colorado?</v>

3696
01:35:01.401 --> 01:35:02.870
<v Speaker 3>I did want to live in Los Angeles anymore.</v>

3697
01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:02.991
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3698
01:35:02.991 --> 01:35:03.824
<v Speaker 3>I don't blame you.</v>

3699
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:04.401
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I do the UFC.</v>

3704
01:35:06.681 --> 01:35:07.101

3706
01:35:07.611 --> 01:35:07.971
<v Speaker 3>I travel.</v>

3707
01:35:07.971 --> 01:35:09.290

3708
01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:10.820

<v Speaker 1>Johnny Sanchez is a very funny guy and a great dude.</v>

3853
01:38:45.130 --> 01:38:45.451

01:38:46.530 --> 01:38:50.160
<v Speaker 1>And he had this great joke about a neighbor that actually really happened to</v>

3856
01:38:50.161 --> 01:38:51.090
<v Speaker 1>them like this.</v>

3857
01:38:51.091 --> 01:38:54.480
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy Persian guy who would always accused people parking in this</v>

3858
01:38:54.481 --> 01:38:55.640
<v Speaker 1>parking spot and he,</v>

3859
01:38:55.641 --> 01:38:58.110
<v Speaker 1>he gets pissed and he speaks his broken English.</v>

3860
01:38:58.111 --> 01:38:59.040
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny.</v>

3861
01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:02.030
<v Speaker 1>This mother fucker does the bit like as he's bringing,</v>

3862
01:39:02.031 --> 01:39:03.270
<v Speaker 1>oh it was Johnny's closing bits.</v>

3863
01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:05.280
<v Speaker 1>So he's going on to a television show that he does.</v>

3864
01:39:05.490 --> 01:39:07.260
<v Speaker 1>He does his closing bit.</v>

3865
01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.780
<v Speaker 1>That's beyond like,</v>

3866
01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:10.260
<v Speaker 1>like just trying to get a laugh.</v>

3867
01:39:10.261 --> 01:39:11.610
<v Speaker 1>That's like sociopathic.</v>

3868
01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:11.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3869
01:39:11.851 --> 01:39:12.270
<v Speaker 1>it's called.</v>

3870
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:12.651
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

3871
01:39:12.651 --> 01:39:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3872
01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.190
<v Speaker 1>There's a pathology there for sure.</v>

3873
01:39:14.191 --> 01:39:14.321
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

3874
01:39:14.321 --> 01:39:14.820
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

3875
01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:14.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3876
01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:15.813
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>

3877
01:39:15.930 --> 01:39:16.411
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3878
01:39:16.411 --> 01:39:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard anything about it year,</v>

3879
01:39:17.670 --> 01:39:17.911
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>

3880
01:39:17.911 --> 01:39:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping he's not doing any morning.</v>

3881
01:39:19.231 --> 01:39:20.400
<v Speaker 1>He's got his shit together now.</v>

3882
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:21.510
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3883
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.751
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3884
01:39:21.751 --> 01:39:22.290
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>

3885
01:39:22.290 --> 01:39:24.240
<v Speaker 1>So when you would happen just a total accident?</v>

3886
01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:24.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3887
01:39:24.301 --> 01:39:25.134
<v Speaker 1>it was total accident,</v>

3888
01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:25.891
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3889
01:39:25.891 --> 01:39:28.710
<v Speaker 1>at the time I'd probably only been doing comedy like six years or so,</v>

3890
01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:29.430
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just like,</v>

3891
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.610
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3892
01:39:29.610 --> 01:39:31.150
<v Speaker 1>that's devastating off fuck here.</v>

3893
01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:31.561
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3894
01:39:31.561 --> 01:39:34.490
<v Speaker 1>like you don't even have like good stage legs in the first six years now.</v>

3895
01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:37.250
<v Speaker 1>And I was throw it all wa but it's,</v>

3896
01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:38.041
<v Speaker 1>it's more than that.</v>

3897
01:39:38.041 --> 01:39:38.341
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

3898
01:39:38.341 --> 01:39:40.890
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole fucking TV aspect of it where you're like,</v>

3899
01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.020
<v Speaker 1>well what if I change my final bit now?</v>

3900
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Are they going to get mad?</v>

3901
01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Cause you have to have everything approved.</v>

3902
01:39:45.610 --> 01:39:46.291
<v Speaker 1>You do a bit.</v>

3903
01:39:46.291 --> 01:39:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Can you do a star wars bit after he does it?</v>

3904
01:39:48.031 --> 01:39:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible?</v>

3905
01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:49.770
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

3906
01:39:49.770 --> 01:39:51.150
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of window that sales.</v>

3907
01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3908
01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:52.081
<v Speaker 1>I really did.</v>

3909
01:39:52.081 --> 01:39:52.410
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

3910
01:39:52.410 --> 01:39:53.880
<v Speaker 1>and it was a shitty joke anyways,</v>

3911
01:39:53.881 --> 01:39:54.091
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3912
01:39:54.091 --> 01:39:54.924
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3913
01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:55.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3914
01:39:55.321 --> 01:39:55.891
<v Speaker 1>looking back,</v>

3915
01:39:55.891 --> 01:39:56.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3916
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:57.780
<v Speaker 1>we were in Vegas and,</v>

3917
01:39:57.781 --> 01:39:58.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3918
01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:01.350
<v Speaker 1>it was me and I think it was Joey Diaz,</v>

3919
01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:02.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe Eddie Bravo,</v>

3920
01:40:02.341 --> 01:40:02.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

3921
01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:06.360
<v Speaker 1>But we were there for some fights and Harlan was playing at the palms,</v>

3922
01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:07.403
<v Speaker 1>so we went to see him.</v>

3923
01:40:08.150 --> 01:40:08.591
<v Speaker 1>Great Guy.</v>

3924
01:40:08.591 --> 01:40:09.424
<v Speaker 1>I Love Harlem.</v>

3925
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Every time I see him,</v>

3926
01:40:10.681 --> 01:40:10.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3927
01:40:10.831 --> 01:40:12.510
<v Speaker 1>he's just say there fella.</v>

3928
01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:15.180
<v Speaker 1>He's like super friendly just as a warm guy.</v>

3929
01:40:15.210 --> 01:40:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

3930
01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:17.760
<v Speaker 1>he goes on and he's fucking killing.</v>

3931
01:40:17.761 --> 01:40:18.750
<v Speaker 1>We're having a great time.</v>

3932
01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:19.141
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

3933
01:40:19.141 --> 01:40:22.160
<v Speaker 1>The fire alarm goes on like a tension,</v>

3934
01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:22.860
<v Speaker 1>you know something?</v>

3935
01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:23.460
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

3936
01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:23.761
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3937
01:40:23.761 --> 01:40:24.150
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

3938
01:40:24.150 --> 01:40:26.940
<v Speaker 1>was it a fire alarm or an emergency alarm?</v>

3939
01:40:26.941 --> 01:40:28.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it was like there was,</v>

3940
01:40:28.530 --> 01:40:29.363
<v Speaker 1>but there was a,</v>

3941
01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:32.870
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3942
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:33.900
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

3943
01:40:33.901 --> 01:40:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Really loud thing.</v>

3944
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:37.580
<v Speaker 1>And Harlan played through it for 10 minutes.</v>

3945
01:40:37.630 --> 01:40:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3946
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:38.760

3947
01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:39.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3948
01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I've watched him deal with every,</v>

3949
01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:42.090
<v Speaker 1>like he's that guy that's funny.</v>

3950
01:40:42.091 --> 01:40:43.660
<v Speaker 1>And every circumstance,</v>

3951
01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:44.371
<v Speaker 1>you know what he is,</v>

3952
01:40:44.371 --> 01:40:45.780
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't get mad about shit.</v>

3953
01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:46.351
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3954
01:40:46.351 --> 01:40:47.580
<v Speaker 1>like he really didn't get mad.</v>

3955
01:40:47.581 --> 01:40:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3956
01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:51.420
<v Speaker 1>And it was kind of funny that this guy was in the middle of his show and he was</v>

3957
01:40:51.421 --> 01:40:51.840
<v Speaker 1>never like,</v>

3958
01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:54.400
<v Speaker 1>but it was really fucked up was we were just sitting there like,</v>

3959
01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:56.230
<v Speaker 1>this ain't real like a real terrorism drug.</v>

3960
01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:00.610
<v Speaker 1>They could have been fucking oh Taliban running in with machine guns and shit.</v>

3961
01:41:00.670 --> 01:41:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3962
01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:01.571
<v Speaker 1>fucking the,</v>

3963
01:41:01.571 --> 01:41:05.950
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese tsunami would happen and I'd be sitting on the beach because I</v>

3964
01:41:05.951 --> 01:41:07.090
<v Speaker 1>don't trust any,</v>

3965
01:41:07.110 --> 01:41:08.680
<v Speaker 1>like anytime they're like,</v>

3966
01:41:08.681 --> 01:41:10.120
<v Speaker 1>we need to evacuate.</v>

3967
01:41:10.121 --> 01:41:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3968
01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:11.500
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

3969
01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time in college I stayed eight like my 22nd floor dorm room.</v>

3970
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3971
01:41:17.681 --> 01:41:18.940
<v Speaker 1>a fire alarm was going.</v>

3972
01:41:18.941 --> 01:41:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

3973
01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:21.280
<v Speaker 1>they're crazy.</v>

3974
01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Because they would always make her go down.</v>

3975
01:41:23.441 --> 01:41:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Come back up.</v>

3976
01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:26.220
<v Speaker 1>That's better than burning to death.</v>

3977
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:27.103
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>

3978
01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:27.881
<v Speaker 1>you're silly.</v>

3979
01:41:27.881 --> 01:41:28.750
<v Speaker 1>You're a silly man.</v>

3980
01:41:29.170 --> 01:41:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't trust them.</v>

3981
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.971
<v Speaker 1>I want to know that.</v>

3982
01:41:30.971 --> 01:41:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Why you went to Colorado so that well,</v>

3983
01:41:32.671 --> 01:41:34.300
<v Speaker 1>well I just didn't want to live in la anymore.</v>

3984
01:41:34.301 --> 01:41:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I think my theory is,</v>

3985
01:41:36.311 --> 01:41:37.780
<v Speaker 1>this would have always said is that there's,</v>

3986
01:41:38.230 --> 01:41:42.220
<v Speaker 1>there's too many human beings in one spot and it's just like rat population</v>

3987
01:41:42.221 --> 01:41:45.430
<v Speaker 1>density studies where they take rats and they put two rats in this cage and</v>

3988
01:41:45.431 --> 01:41:48.340
<v Speaker 1>they're fine and they put four and then by the time you have a bunch,</v>

3989
01:41:48.341 --> 01:41:49.130
<v Speaker 1>you have all these,</v>

3990
01:41:49.130 --> 01:41:50.620
<v Speaker 1>these crazy behaviors,</v>

3991
01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:51.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3992
01:41:51.401 --> 01:41:54.670
<v Speaker 1>rats sit in the corner shaking and the nutty rats,</v>

3993
01:41:54.671 --> 01:41:55.481
<v Speaker 1>aggressive rats.</v>

3994
01:41:55.481 --> 01:41:56.800
<v Speaker 1>And I just think there's a,</v>

3995
01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:58.270
<v Speaker 1>there's without a doubt,</v>

3996
01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:00.370
<v Speaker 1>you get a certain amount of energy from people.</v>

3997
01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:02.680
<v Speaker 1>You get a certain amount of energy from the people that you're around.</v>

3998
01:42:02.681 --> 01:42:03.940
<v Speaker 1>And if you're in a tense neighborhood,</v>

3999
01:42:03.941 --> 01:42:05.740
<v Speaker 1>you absorb a certain amount of that tension.</v>

4000
01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:07.270
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to relax.</v>

4001
01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:10.720
<v Speaker 1>And whenever I've been to places that have a lighter population,</v>

4002
01:42:10.721 --> 01:42:12.220
<v Speaker 1>like boulder for example,</v>

4003
01:42:12.490 --> 01:42:12.821
<v Speaker 1>boulder,</v>

4004
01:42:12.821 --> 01:42:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Colorado is only a hundred thousand so where you were living and they drive</v>

4005
01:42:16.241 --> 01:42:16.691
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

4006
01:42:16.691 --> 01:42:18.010
<v Speaker 1>everyone's driving slow,</v>

4007
01:42:18.011 --> 01:42:18.940
<v Speaker 1>no one's tense.</v>

4008
01:42:18.941 --> 01:42:20.360
<v Speaker 1>There's no one running red lights.</v>

4009
01:42:20.361 --> 01:42:23.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not all the continents of Los Angeles doesn't exist there.</v>

4010
01:42:23.741 --> 01:42:24.041
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

4011
01:42:24.041 --> 01:42:25.270
<v Speaker 1>you've got to deal with some snow,</v>

4012
01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:27.460
<v Speaker 1>but you deal with a nicer class of people.</v>

4013
01:42:27.461 --> 01:42:30.700
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's people that aren't under the gun and you take people out of</v>

4014
01:42:30.701 --> 01:42:34.360
<v Speaker 1>this environment like me and you put them over there and you calm down cause you</v>

4015
01:42:34.361 --> 01:42:34.720
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

4016
01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:36.040
<v Speaker 1>ask anybody about Los Angeles.</v>

4017
01:42:36.041 --> 01:42:39.250
<v Speaker 1>There was just a study that people hate people from Los Angeles and I said</v>

4018
01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.600
<v Speaker 1>that's cause we always tell you,</v>

4019
01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:42.280
<v Speaker 1>you know what the temperature is.</v>

4020
01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:42.521
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

4021
01:42:42.521 --> 01:42:43.354
<v Speaker 1>when you call someone,</v>

4022
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:43.891
<v Speaker 1>Hey I'm man,</v>

4023
01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Boston,</v>

4024
01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:45.940
<v Speaker 1>really 70 degrees here,</v>

4025
01:42:45.941 --> 01:42:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing shorts.</v>

4026
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:47.531
<v Speaker 1>You know there's that.</v>

4027
01:42:47.531 --> 01:42:48.364
<v Speaker 1>But please,</v>

4028
01:42:48.370 --> 01:42:50.710
<v Speaker 1>this is a real issue with why people come here.</v>

4029
01:42:50.711 --> 01:42:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Like what you said they should call it.</v>

4030
01:42:52.211 --> 01:42:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Daddy doesn't love me on the side and their shits taxing after awhile.</v>

4031
01:42:55.630 --> 01:42:57.670
<v Speaker 1>It's taxing and it's also that,</v>

4032
01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:59.320
<v Speaker 1>that overpopulation thing,</v>

4033
01:42:59.321 --> 01:43:01.780
<v Speaker 1>like you take away the traffic out of La,</v>

4034
01:43:01.890 --> 01:43:02.220
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4035
01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:04.030
<v Speaker 1>it take away the population.</v>

4036
01:43:04.031 --> 01:43:05.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty nice place,</v>

4037
01:43:05.230 --> 01:43:08.560
<v Speaker 1>beautiful mountains and oceans and it's great.</v>

4038
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:09.910
<v Speaker 1>But fuck,</v>

4039
01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:11.170
<v Speaker 1>it's not as nice as boulder though.</v>

4040
01:43:11.250 --> 01:43:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Not as nice as Australian looking at the,</v>

4041
01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.800
<v Speaker 1>the visuals of boulder.</v>

4042
01:43:14.801 --> 01:43:17.860
<v Speaker 1>But it was amazing to me was that you could drive around and you'd look at these</v>

4043
01:43:17.861 --> 01:43:18.251
<v Speaker 1>mountains.</v>

4044
01:43:18.251 --> 01:43:18.521
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

4045
01:43:18.521 --> 01:43:19.354
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

4046
01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:21.010
<v Speaker 1>if this was a painting,</v>

4047
01:43:21.011 --> 01:43:22.510
<v Speaker 1>it would be worth $1 billion.</v>

4048
01:43:22.511 --> 01:43:26.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like the most incredible natural piece of artwork and it's in front of you</v>

4049
01:43:26.201 --> 01:43:27.034
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

4050
01:43:27.190 --> 01:43:28.023
<v Speaker 1>It's like that is,</v>

4051
01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:28.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4052
01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:31.480
<v Speaker 1>and it has a tangible effect when you're looking at mountains,</v>

4053
01:43:31.481 --> 01:43:34.120
<v Speaker 1>like there's a place in Colorado I really liked called evergreen.</v>

4054
01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:39.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a suburb of Denver and my God,</v>

4055
01:43:39.071 --> 01:43:39.461
<v Speaker 1>the view,</v>

4056
01:43:39.461 --> 01:43:40.480
<v Speaker 1>there's insane.</v>

4057
01:43:40.570 --> 01:43:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I looked through this one house and I just sat on the porch and I couldn't even</v>

4058
01:43:43.781 --> 01:43:46.000
<v Speaker 1>fucking believe that they would allow you to live there.</v>

4059
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:46.510
<v Speaker 1>How long,</v>

4060
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:49.810
<v Speaker 1>how long did you stay for months and why'd you leave?</v>

4061
01:43:49.811 --> 01:43:50.800
<v Speaker 1>So my wife got pregnant.</v>

4062
01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4063
01:43:51.330 --> 01:43:51.660
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

4064
01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:52.280
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

4065
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.470
<v Speaker 1>We were way high in the mountains we were at,</v>

4066
01:43:54.471 --> 01:43:55.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4067
01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:58.340
<v Speaker 1>where we were was 3000 feet above boulder,</v>

4068
01:43:58.460 --> 01:43:59.420
<v Speaker 1>so it was 8,000,</v>

4069
01:43:59.421 --> 01:44:00.171
<v Speaker 1>500 feet.</v>

4070
01:44:00.171 --> 01:44:01.004
<v Speaker 1>It's really high.</v>

4071
01:44:01.010 --> 01:44:01.631
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

4072
01:44:01.631 --> 01:44:01.850
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4073
01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:03.320
<v Speaker 1>you can't be pregnant up there.</v>

4074
01:44:03.321 --> 01:44:04.100
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4075
01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:07.580
<v Speaker 1>even regular women that live in boulder itself,</v>

4076
01:44:07.581 --> 01:44:09.260
<v Speaker 1>which is 5,000 feet in Denver,</v>

4077
01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:09.590
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>

4078
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:12.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a really high rate of premature births.</v>

4079
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

4080
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Because of the oxygen,</v>

4081
01:44:14.631 --> 01:44:15.200
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

4082
01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:16.250
<v Speaker 1>there's no air up there,</v>

4083
01:44:16.251 --> 01:44:17.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4084
01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:21.620
<v Speaker 1>I would work out in my yard and do these kettle bell drills that I do and it's</v>

4085
01:44:21.650 --> 01:44:22.060
<v Speaker 1>you'd,</v>

4086
01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you'd really feel like there's not enough air in the world.</v>

4087
01:44:24.441 --> 01:44:25.330
<v Speaker 1>You can't get any air.</v>

4088
01:44:25.331 --> 01:44:25.971
<v Speaker 1>It's thin,</v>

4089
01:44:25.971 --> 01:44:28.400
<v Speaker 1>like walk up the stairs and you're tired.</v>

4090
01:44:28.610 --> 01:44:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really thin up there.</v>

4091
01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:32.060
<v Speaker 1>So for her it was brutal.</v>

4092
01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:32.511
<v Speaker 1>It was the,</v>

4093
01:44:32.511 --> 01:44:34.790
<v Speaker 1>the morning sickness was intolerable.</v>

4094
01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:35.960
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>

4095
01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:39.380
<v Speaker 1>it's just a real trick you up there when it's snowing and we were in the</v>

4096
01:44:39.381 --> 01:44:42.230
<v Speaker 1>mountains and mountain lions and bears and shit.</v>

4097
01:44:42.231 --> 01:44:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of real study of cats.</v>

4098
01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Why a dog got killed,</v>

4099
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:46.340
<v Speaker 1>killed by mountain lions.</v>

4100
01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:47.690
<v Speaker 1>That happens a lot.</v>

4101
01:44:47.691 --> 01:44:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Drink.</v>

4102
01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:49.093
<v Speaker 1>That sucks.</v>

4103
01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:50.570
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>

4104
01:44:51.230 --> 01:44:54.410
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare that it happens because there's so much for them to eat up there.</v>

4105
01:44:54.530 --> 01:44:54.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4106
01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.930
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare that one will attack a human.</v>

4107
01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:59.960
<v Speaker 1>But you every now and then could be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</v>

4108
01:44:59.961 --> 01:45:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And you find an old one that has like,</v>

4109
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:02.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4110
01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.010
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have sharp teeth anymore,</v>

4111
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:05.150
<v Speaker 1>but it could still kill Ya.</v>

4112
01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

4113
01:45:05.690 --> 01:45:06.800
<v Speaker 1>that would kill me if my dog,</v>

4114
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:08.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's so gorgeous up there,</v>

4115
01:45:08.541 --> 01:45:08.811
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4116
01:45:08.811 --> 01:45:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

4117
01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:11.150
<v Speaker 1>my wife says is the calmest I've ever been.</v>

4118
01:45:11.151 --> 01:45:13.020
<v Speaker 1>She's ever known me and my life was when we were living at,</v>

4119
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:14.120
<v Speaker 1>you need to go to Australia.</v>

4120
01:45:15.090 --> 01:45:15.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4121
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.951
<v Speaker 1>Australia is cool,</v>

4122
01:45:15.951 --> 01:45:16.784
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

4123
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:17.271
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

4124
01:45:17.271 --> 01:45:17.721
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

4125
01:45:17.721 --> 01:45:18.471
<v Speaker 1>it's not America.</v>

4126
01:45:18.471 --> 01:45:19.460
<v Speaker 1>So that would bum me out.</v>

4127
01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:20.271
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

4128
01:45:20.271 --> 01:45:20.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4129
01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:22.040
<v Speaker 1>it's Cunty as America could be.</v>

4130
01:45:22.041 --> 01:45:23.210
<v Speaker 1>It's still where I was born.</v>

4131
01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm used to it here.</v>

4132
01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:26.330
<v Speaker 1>I could get used to it.</v>

4133
01:45:26.331 --> 01:45:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Like in terms of like,</v>

4134
01:45:27.291 --> 01:45:29.690
<v Speaker 1>if America was the apocalypse in Australia was the way it is.</v>

4135
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:30.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4136
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:32.960
<v Speaker 4>That kind of happened to me where I went there and I was like,</v>

4137
01:45:32.961 --> 01:45:33.111

4139
01:45:33.621 --> 01:45:35.360
<v Speaker 4>I still have family here.</v>

4140
01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:36.111
<v Speaker 4>And that's the thing.</v>

4141
01:45:36.111 --> 01:45:38.630
<v Speaker 4>I can't be that far from my family otherwise.</v>

4142
01:45:38.631 --> 01:45:39.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

01:45:39.921 --> 01:45:40.680

4145
01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:41.630
<v Speaker 4>You went and he's,</v>

4146
01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:42.361
<v Speaker 4>he lives there.</v>

4147
01:45:42.361 --> 01:45:43.194
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4148
01:45:43.670 --> 01:45:47.440

4149
01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:48.283
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4150
01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.630
<v Speaker 4>People don't understand what a big superstar he is.</v>

4151
01:45:50.631 --> 01:45:53.150
<v Speaker 4>Like if you walk down the street here in America with like a famous,</v>

4152
01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:53.860

<v Speaker 4>how often would you get recognized?</v>

4159
01:46:01.101 --> 01:46:03.830
<v Speaker 4>Depends on if there's a bunch of young dudes with tattoos.</v>

4160
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:07.640
<v Speaker 4>Obviously young dudes tattoos most likely.</v>

4161
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:09.020

<v Speaker 4>Cause you,</v>

4174
01:46:32.690 --> 01:46:37.190
<v Speaker 4>cause you think about it like that's back before people had 500 channels and</v>

4175
01:46:37.191 --> 01:46:41.830
<v Speaker 4>before people had the internet and before like where you only watch like like</v>

4176
01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:43.250
<v Speaker 4>five things on TV.</v>

4177
01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:44.570
<v Speaker 4>That's what they had back then.</v>

4178
01:46:45.230 --> 01:46:46.640
<v Speaker 4>Well they've just lately,</v>

4179
01:46:46.641 --> 01:46:47.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean they used to have,</v>

4180
01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:48.493
<v Speaker 4>they don't have cable.</v>

4181
01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:50.490
<v Speaker 4>They do have cable but not a lot of people have it.</v>

4182
01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:51.390
<v Speaker 4>Do they,</v>

4183
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:52.560
<v Speaker 4>do they get American channels?</v>

4184
01:46:52.590 --> 01:46:53.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah they do.</v>

4185
01:46:53.431 --> 01:46:54.470
<v Speaker 4>And now everybody,</v>

4186
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:55.440
<v Speaker 4>because of the Internet,</v>

4187
01:46:55.470 --> 01:46:58.620
<v Speaker 4>everybody's watching everything on the Internet and DVDs and everything and,</v>

4188
01:46:58.890 --> 01:46:59.600
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>

4189
01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:03.570
<v Speaker 4>they take a lot of our movies and put Monte but shitty movies and Shitty sitcoms</v>

4190
01:47:03.571 --> 01:47:03.900
<v Speaker 4>and stuff.</v>

4191
01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:07.380
<v Speaker 4>Like when it was impossible or give you at a DVD from there it was a different</v>

4192
01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:09.030
<v Speaker 4>villages still is.</v>

4193
01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:12.090
<v Speaker 4>What does that at pal and NTSC I don't know.</v>

4194
01:47:12.091 --> 01:47:15.420
<v Speaker 4>But wait a minute pal and NTSC doesn't not exist with a VHS.</v>

4195
01:47:15.450 --> 01:47:17.300
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that VHS DVDs,</v>

4196
01:47:17.301 --> 01:47:17.731
<v Speaker 4>DVDs,</v>

4197
01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:18.564
<v Speaker 4>DVDs,</v>

4198
01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:20.730
<v Speaker 4>game with VHS.</v>

4199
01:47:20.731 --> 01:47:22.200
<v Speaker 4>There was an issue with that too,</v>

4200
01:47:22.201 --> 01:47:22.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4201
01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:23.413
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't there?</v>

4202
01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:24.151
<v Speaker 4>It's always been,</v>

4203
01:47:24.151 --> 01:47:27.550
<v Speaker 4>it's a signal that I believe that there are TVs you so I think,</v>

4204
01:47:27.570 --> 01:47:28.630
<v Speaker 4>cause I remember I got a,</v>

4205
01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:33.640
<v Speaker 4>an multi-region DVD player just so I could watch the Ali g show from England</v>

4206
01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:37.590
<v Speaker 4>cause this is a totally different kind of DVD if you play like on my Mac,</v>

4207
01:47:37.710 --> 01:47:41.930
<v Speaker 4>if I play a pal DVD it'll say you only have five more feedback.</v>

4208
01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:43.230
<v Speaker 4>And then it and my,</v>

4209
01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:43.980
<v Speaker 4>my old,</v>

4210
01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:45.420
<v Speaker 4>my old Max switched over.</v>

4211
01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:47.040
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is that man?</v>

4212
01:47:47.250 --> 01:47:50.520
<v Speaker 4>What does that Bull Shit I had to buy like software to convert it back.</v>

4213
01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:53.670
<v Speaker 4>And it was like really you it was a third party software.</v>

4214
01:47:53.671 --> 01:47:54.750
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking crazy.</v>

4215
01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:55.770
<v Speaker 4>That's so stupid.</v>

4216
01:47:55.771 --> 01:47:57.030
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

4217
01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.040
<v Speaker 4>It has something to do with the cameras.</v>

4218
01:47:59.041 --> 01:48:02.040
<v Speaker 4>Cause I remember we were editing when I made my movie,</v>

4219
01:48:02.041 --> 01:48:06.150
<v Speaker 4>we had some cameramen overseas and then we'd have to have all those,</v>

4220
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:09.340
<v Speaker 4>all that tape we are shooting on mini DV at the time we'd have it have a</v>

4221
01:48:09.341 --> 01:48:10.660
<v Speaker 4>converted and,</v>

4222
01:48:10.690 --> 01:48:12.690
<v Speaker 4>and it was such a process and I'd go why?</v>

4223
01:48:12.691 --> 01:48:13.110
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

4224
01:48:13.110 --> 01:48:15.960
<v Speaker 4>actually I think there's more pixels or something.</v>

4225
01:48:15.961 --> 01:48:16.770
<v Speaker 4>And a pal.</v>

4226
01:48:16.770 --> 01:48:17.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>

4227
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:19.890
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense that there's two different formats so it didn't agree on and</v>

4228
01:48:19.891 --> 01:48:20.011
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

4229
01:48:20.011 --> 01:48:22.380
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't make sense as your computer can switch back and forth,</v>

4230
01:48:22.381 --> 01:48:23.550
<v Speaker 4>but only five times.</v>

4231
01:48:24.020 --> 01:48:25.530
<v Speaker 4>Why do you Brian,</v>

4232
01:48:25.531 --> 01:48:26.190
<v Speaker 4>do you know?</v>

4233
01:48:26.190 --> 01:48:26.671
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

4234
01:48:26.671 --> 01:48:27.504
<v Speaker 4>I never saw that before.</v>

4235
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:28.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure we're going to get,</v>

4236
01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:32.370
<v Speaker 4>all of us are going to get emails and twitters and I'm sure the tweets and I'm</v>

4237
01:48:32.371 --> 01:48:33.150
<v Speaker 4>going to get to come roll.</v>

4238
01:48:33.150 --> 01:48:35.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get yelled at for something was inaccurate.</v>

4239
01:48:35.970 --> 01:48:37.320

4240
01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:39.900
<v Speaker 1>well and gets the abuse Calli guess when he comes on here.</v>

4275
01:49:37.621 --> 01:49:42.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like we never really took advantage of the resource that was us in our</v>

4276
01:49:42.241 --> 01:49:44.880
<v Speaker 1>friendships until podcasts came along.</v>

4277
01:49:45.090 --> 01:49:45.331
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4278
01:49:45.331 --> 01:49:45.630
<v Speaker 1>pot,</v>

4279
01:49:45.630 --> 01:49:46.980
<v Speaker 1>like when we had radio shows,</v>

4280
01:49:47.050 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 1>if you would go on someone's</v>

4281
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:48.521
<v Speaker 4>radio show,</v>

4282
01:49:48.521 --> 01:49:51.250
<v Speaker 4>it's very rare that you could just bring it all your friends with you on the</v>

4283
01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:52.690
<v Speaker 4>radio show and put on,</v>

4284
01:49:53.170 --> 01:49:55.240
<v Speaker 4>you have to interact with these djs.</v>

4285
01:49:55.241 --> 01:49:56.920
<v Speaker 4>And that was their thing and that was it.</v>

4286
01:49:57.070 --> 01:50:00.910
<v Speaker 4>So it's like you never really got a chance to like sit down purposely.</v>

4287
01:50:00.911 --> 01:50:02.500
<v Speaker 4>Like we're gonna meet at three o'clock,</v>

4288
01:50:02.501 --> 01:50:03.430
<v Speaker 4>we're all gonna sit down,</v>

4289
01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:04.570
<v Speaker 4>we're going to smoke some weed,</v>

4290
01:50:04.571 --> 01:50:05.620
<v Speaker 4>we're going to drink some coffee,</v>

4291
01:50:05.790 --> 01:50:07.600
<v Speaker 4>let's talk some shit about all kinds of things.</v>

4292
01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:09.430
<v Speaker 4>Like that would be a great thing to do.</v>

4293
01:50:09.490 --> 01:50:12.100
<v Speaker 4>But nobody ever schedule shit talking sessions.</v>

4294
01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:16.030
<v Speaker 4>But because the fact that everyone is going to hear about this and it's going to</v>

4295
01:50:16.031 --> 01:50:18.700
<v Speaker 4>be something that goes on the Internet and people going to enjoy it.</v>

4296
01:50:18.701 --> 01:50:20.620
<v Speaker 4>And then we started doing it.</v>

4297
01:50:20.650 --> 01:50:21.640
<v Speaker 4>And the coolest thing about it,</v>

4298
01:50:21.641 --> 01:50:24.220
<v Speaker 4>like what I love about your podcast is you,</v>

4299
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:27.160
<v Speaker 4>you guys like you just talk.</v>

4300
01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.730
<v Speaker 4>And comics are interesting people because we have a lot of time on our hands.</v>

4301
01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:31.893
<v Speaker 4>So we,</v>

4302
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:35.020
<v Speaker 4>most people have to do their job and that's why they're really good at their job</v>

4303
01:50:35.021 --> 01:50:35.854
<v Speaker 4>because they do it,</v>

4304
01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:40.290
<v Speaker 4>we do our stand up and then we have a lot of extra time and our,</v>

4305
01:50:40.350 --> 01:50:44.740
<v Speaker 4>our standup comes from our extra time of us thinking and philosophizing.</v>

4306
01:50:44.890 --> 01:50:45.910
<v Speaker 4>And in doing so,</v>

4307
01:50:45.911 --> 01:50:48.490
<v Speaker 4>we all acquire lots of hobbies and lots of things.</v>

4308
01:50:48.491 --> 01:50:50.080
<v Speaker 4>We get into and we're,</v>

4309
01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:52.330
<v Speaker 4>we're all of a kind of weird kind of mindset.</v>

4310
01:50:52.331 --> 01:50:55.300
<v Speaker 4>Like to be a comic you have to be a bit OCD,</v>

4311
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:56.590
<v Speaker 4>a bit neurotic.</v>

4312
01:50:56.591 --> 01:50:58.180
<v Speaker 4>There's all these different aspects of it.</v>

4313
01:50:58.330 --> 01:50:59.620
<v Speaker 4>So you compile all that,</v>

4314
01:50:59.621 --> 01:51:02.320
<v Speaker 4>you've got like a certain type of individual.</v>

4315
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:04.100
<v Speaker 4>And so we all have a knowledge base.</v>

4316
01:51:04.101 --> 01:51:06.040
<v Speaker 4>It's like we have generalized knowledge,</v>

4317
01:51:06.041 --> 01:51:07.750
<v Speaker 4>not a lot of specialized knowledge and,</v>

4318
01:51:07.751 --> 01:51:11.170
<v Speaker 4>but we have a general knowledge of all these different things and then we're</v>

4319
01:51:11.171 --> 01:51:13.330
<v Speaker 4>able to also spend humor into it.</v>

4320
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:14.201
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking,</v>

4321
01:51:14.201 --> 01:51:15.880
<v Speaker 4>it's like the greatest people that hang out with.</v>

4322
01:51:15.881 --> 01:51:16.080
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4323
01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:16.870
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>

4324
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:18.010
<v Speaker 4>And I'm glad that everyone,</v>

4325
01:51:18.011 --> 01:51:18.311
<v Speaker 4>people go,</v>

4326
01:51:18.311 --> 01:51:19.270
<v Speaker 4>aren't there too many podcasts?</v>

4327
01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:19.571
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4328
01:51:19.571 --> 01:51:20.560
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking great.</v>

4329
01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:21.730
<v Speaker 4>Well not only that,</v>

4330
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:22.030
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4331
01:51:22.030 --> 01:51:26.080
<v Speaker 4>I think it's really cool that right from the beginning everyone has a sort of</v>

4332
01:51:26.081 --> 01:51:29.080
<v Speaker 4>helped each other out and everyone has promoted each other.</v>

4333
01:51:29.081 --> 01:51:29.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4334

4365
01:51:55.871 --> 01:51:56.970
<v Speaker 4>It's our podcast.</v>

4366
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.641
<v Speaker 4>This is no line.</v>

4367
01:51:57.641 --> 01:51:58.301
<v Speaker 4>I'm not blowing smoke.</v>

4368
01:51:58.301 --> 01:52:01.240
<v Speaker 4>We get to see the numbers on Libsyn and how we're doing.</v>

4369
01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:04.390
<v Speaker 4>We get our biggest spikes when we win.</v>

4370
01:52:04.391 --> 01:52:05.380
<v Speaker 4>Like I'll do your show,</v>

4371
01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:05.800
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4372

<v Speaker 4>that's awesome.</v>

4374
01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:06.551
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4375
01:52:06.551 --> 01:52:07.240
<v Speaker 4>when I do,</v>

4376
01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Jim gets on your show and never talks about our podcasts.</v>

4377
01:52:10.150 --> 01:52:11.470
<v Speaker 4>So fucking nothing happened.</v>

4378
01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:14.590
<v Speaker 4>He sells more DVDs if got,</v>

4379
01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:15.850
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

4380
01:52:15.850 --> 01:52:18.270
<v Speaker 4>but I get on here and plug talking Shit and uh,</v>

4381
01:52:18.570 --> 01:52:19.720
<v Speaker 4>seriously it,</v>

4382
01:52:19.721 --> 01:52:24.030
<v Speaker 4>like you can see and what happens is it spikes and then it'll plateau for a</v>

4383
01:52:24.031 --> 01:52:27.850
<v Speaker 4>while and then I'll do like your show or Jamiel wars or Corollas or something</v>

4384
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:28.990
<v Speaker 4>and then it'll spike again.</v>

4385
01:52:28.991 --> 01:52:33.310
<v Speaker 4>So it's showing that like the audience is coming and they like it and they stay.</v>

4386
01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:35.860
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I always tell other guys with pockets,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4445
01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:13.520

4446
01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:17.060
<v Speaker 3>people didn't realize how brilliant he really is because they see him on stage.</v>

4447
01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:18.320
<v Speaker 3>He's talking about eating ass,</v>

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4488
01:55:04.371 --> 01:55:06.020
<v Speaker 3>about why he hates Dane Cook.</v>

4489
01:55:06.021 --> 01:55:07.010
<v Speaker 3>And you're not allowed to.</v>

4490
01:55:07.870 --> 01:55:08.190
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4491

<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

4495
01:55:14.931 --> 01:55:15.651
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the day,</v>

4496
01:55:15.651 --> 01:55:20.180
<v Speaker 3>if I saw Dane Cook in like an airport lobby or whatever and I saw you,</v>

4497
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:21.710
<v Speaker 3>I'd go hang out with Dane Cook.</v>

4498
01:55:21.730 --> 01:55:22.130
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4499
01:55:22.130 --> 01:55:22.461
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

4500
01:55:22.461 --> 01:55:23.294
<v Speaker 3>cause I'd have,</v>

4501
01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:25.820
<v Speaker 3>cause I'd have more in common with Dane Cook.</v>

4502
01:55:25.821 --> 01:55:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Then you and I could talk to Dane and we have shit to talk about.</v>

4503
01:55:29.391 --> 01:55:29.751
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

01:55:30.481 --> 01:55:31.610
<v Speaker 3>you know you're a fan.</v>

<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

4509
01:55:32.961 --> 01:55:36.700
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird way of separating yourself from all your people.</v>

4510
01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:37.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4511

<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4514
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:41.420
<v Speaker 3>The point Stan hope was making was he was saying like that everybody,</v>

4515
01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:46.260
<v Speaker 3>like he had a problem with Dane and his problem was Dane called him a hater and</v>

4516
01:55:46.261 --> 01:55:47.220
<v Speaker 3>said that he was jealous of him.</v>

4517
01:55:47.221 --> 01:55:47.581
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

4518
01:55:47.581 --> 01:55:48.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm not jealous of you.</v>

4519
01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:49.471
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4520
01:55:49.471 --> 01:55:49.990

01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.250
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

4522
01:55:50.250 --> 01:55:52.380
<v Speaker 3>he explained why and it was a valid,</v>

4523
01:55:52.381 --> 01:55:52.711
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

4524
01:55:52.711 --> 01:55:53.130
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

4525
01:55:53.130 --> 01:55:56.490
<v Speaker 3>nobody was jealous of Chris rock or Jon Stewart or Dave Chappelle.</v>

4526
01:55:56.491 --> 01:55:57.390
<v Speaker 3>When they got famous,</v>

4527
01:55:57.391 --> 01:55:58.110
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

4528
01:55:58.110 --> 01:56:01.740
<v Speaker 3>we're not jealous of you were angry with Annie and it was a problem because they</v>

4529
01:56:01.741 --> 01:56:03.780
<v Speaker 3>had this thing over stand up,</v>

4530
01:56:03.781 --> 01:56:05.880
<v Speaker 3>calling them on the phone and it was just does,</v>

4531
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:06.750
<v Speaker 3>it's a whole long thing.</v>

4532
01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:08.670
<v Speaker 3>But at the end of the day he was saying,</v>

4533
01:56:08.671 --> 01:56:08.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4534
01:56:08.911 --> 01:56:13.260
<v Speaker 3>like here's my problems with them and it's a comic having a problem with a comic</v>

4535
01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:14.430
<v Speaker 3>over comic issues.</v>

4536
01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:15.091
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>

4537
01:56:15.091 --> 01:56:19.020
<v Speaker 3>people that don't like Dane now like you fans that don't like Dang you're</v>

4538
01:56:19.021 --> 01:56:21.870
<v Speaker 3>jumping on the bandwagon not knowing why</v>

4539
01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:22.980
<v Speaker 1>as sort of,</v>

4540
01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:24.181
<v Speaker 1>I disagree though,</v>

4541
01:56:24.181 --> 01:56:26.580
<v Speaker 1>because I think a lot of people don't like people cause it's just not their</v>

4542
01:56:26.581 --> 01:56:27.151
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

4543
01:56:27.151 --> 01:56:29.490
<v Speaker 1>And if you like a certain type of music and I don't like it,</v>

4544
01:56:29.491 --> 01:56:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I'll shit all over that music.</v>

4545
01:56:31.170 --> 01:56:31.800
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4546
01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:32.041
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4547
01:56:32.041 --> 01:56:33.390
<v Speaker 1>But I mean that's just what people do.</v>

4548
01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4549
01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:35.250
<v Speaker 1>But I sounded lightened thing to do.</v>

4550
01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:35.611
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4551
01:56:35.611 --> 01:56:36.301
<v Speaker 3>I think there's though,</v>

4552
01:56:36.301 --> 01:56:41.301
<v Speaker 3>now in comedy there's so many people are aware of not just comedy,</v>

4553
01:56:42.481 --> 01:56:43.151
<v Speaker 3>like what they like,</v>

4554
01:56:43.151 --> 01:56:44.310
<v Speaker 3>but the clicks of comedy</v>

4555
01:56:44.410 --> 01:56:46.720
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] who's an easy target.</v>

4556
01:56:46.721 --> 01:56:47.411
<v Speaker 1>A safe target.</v>

4557
01:56:47.411 --> 01:56:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4558
01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:49.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

4559
01:56:49.150 --> 01:56:50.990
<v Speaker 1>it's like for a while Dan was getting bashed,</v>

4560
01:56:50.991 --> 01:56:52.270
<v Speaker 1>show hard that I wanted,</v>

4561
01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:53.810
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to get on the other side.</v>

4562
01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:55.210
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like Jane supporter.</v>

4563
01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:57.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure people would have loved to have bath.</v>

4564
01:56:57.011 --> 01:57:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Chris rock if he had like a chink in his armor or even Dave Chappelle,</v>

4565
01:57:00.551 --> 01:57:02.140
<v Speaker 1>if he had something like wrong with Woodward,</v>

4566
01:57:02.141 --> 01:57:02.651
<v Speaker 1>he was doing,</v>

4567
01:57:02.651 --> 01:57:03.970
<v Speaker 1>they'd like to go after him too.</v>

4568
01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:04.541
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4569
01:57:04.541 --> 01:57:05.540
<v Speaker 1>I think when,</v>

4570
01:57:05.541 --> 01:57:06.700
<v Speaker 1>when people look,</v>

4571
01:57:06.701 --> 01:57:08.410
<v Speaker 1>when you're real successful and they look,</v>

4572
01:57:08.411 --> 01:57:10.260
<v Speaker 1>if they find something fucking other,</v>

4573
01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:11.113
<v Speaker 1>they're going to harp on it.</v>

4574
01:57:11.410 --> 01:57:12.970
<v Speaker 1>But if they don't find something,</v>

4575
01:57:13.090 --> 01:57:14.440
<v Speaker 1>then you're Chris Rock.</v>

4576
01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:15.161
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4577
01:57:15.161 --> 01:57:15.700
<v Speaker 1>And you're just,</v>

4578
01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:16.830
<v Speaker 1>you're just a brilliant comedian.</v>

4579
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:17.721

4580
01:57:17.721 --> 01:57:20.170
<v Speaker 1>And not stealing is not not a bullshit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4583
01:57:21.490 --> 01:57:25.330
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's really where it's at because it's not just black guys.</v>

4584
01:57:25.330 --> 01:57:27.580
<v Speaker 1>It's what Louis C K nobody hates on Louis Ck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4644
01:58:40.521 --> 01:58:41.950
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a lot lucky guys</v>

4645
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:43.390
<v Speaker 5>and they've made it big,</v>

4646
01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:44.920
<v Speaker 5>but they've never stuck.</v>

4647
01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:47.180
<v Speaker 5>They don't stick around because they're like lottery winners.</v>

4648
01:58:47.190 --> 01:58:47.371
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4649
01:58:47.371 --> 01:58:47.740
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

4650
01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:49.270
<v Speaker 5>you got to really have it.</v>

4651
01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:52.160
<v Speaker 5>And the guys that are like you're saying like Chris Rock and well you should,</v>

4652
01:58:52.290 --> 01:58:52.901
<v Speaker 5>you'd also,</v>

4653
01:58:52.901 --> 01:58:54.730
<v Speaker 5>it has to be a passion of yours.</v>

4654
01:58:54.731 --> 01:58:55.031
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4655
01:58:55.031 --> 01:58:58.890
<v Speaker 5>I've spent a lot of time doing things that were not a passion of mine and I</v>

4656
01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:02.560
<v Speaker 5>spent a lot of time doing other people's stuff like other people's TV shows or</v>

4657
01:59:02.561 --> 01:59:04.600
<v Speaker 5>other peoples and was often times,</v>

4658
01:59:04.630 --> 01:59:08.410
<v Speaker 5>but there's this just such a massive difference between doing something that</v>

4659
01:59:08.411 --> 01:59:09.700
<v Speaker 5>you're really passionate about,</v>

4660
01:59:09.850 --> 01:59:10.151
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4661
01:59:10.151 --> 01:59:13.330
<v Speaker 5>and and putting all that energy and that reward that you get from that.</v>

4662
01:59:13.630 --> 01:59:14.560
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing like that.</v>

4663
01:59:14.561 --> 01:59:15.020
<v Speaker 5>That's what,</v>

4664
01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:16.540
<v Speaker 5>that's where real success comes from.</v>

4665
01:59:16.541 --> 01:59:19.720
<v Speaker 5>Real success comes from transferring that passion and then people go and</v>

4666
01:59:19.721 --> 01:59:21.910
<v Speaker 5>experience it and they feel it and it's pure and it's real.</v>

4667
01:59:22.210 --> 01:59:22.451
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4668
01:59:22.451 --> 01:59:22.960
<v Speaker 5>when your,</v>

4669
01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:26.890
<v Speaker 5>your standup is really just sort of a vehicle for getting out the greatness.</v>

4670
01:59:26.891 --> 01:59:28.720
<v Speaker 5>It's not inside of all of us.</v>

4671
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:29.111
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4672
01:59:29.111 --> 01:59:33.130
<v Speaker 5>whether that greatness manifest itself in piano playing or the manifests itself</v>

4673
01:59:33.131 --> 01:59:33.851
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

4674
01:59:33.851 --> 01:59:33.991
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

4675
01:59:33.991 --> 01:59:34.181
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

4678
01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:40.030
<v Speaker 5>that what that thing is just,</v>

4679
01:59:40.031 --> 01:59:42.580
<v Speaker 5>it's just finding that in yourself and,</v>

4680
01:59:42.590 --> 01:59:47.320
<v Speaker 5>and providing something to other people that gives them this energetic reaction.</v>

4681
01:59:47.321 --> 01:59:47.510
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4682
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:48.341
<v Speaker 5>they're sitting in the audience.</v>

4683
01:59:48.341 --> 01:59:49.240
<v Speaker 5>It's laughter.</v>

4684
01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:49.600
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4688
01:59:51.161 --> 01:59:51.340
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4689
01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:53.170
<v Speaker 5>it's not laughter but it's this other crazy,</v>

4690
01:59:53.171 --> 01:59:53.531
<v Speaker 5>weird,</v>

4691
01:59:53.531 --> 01:59:54.341
<v Speaker 5>satisfying thing.</v>

4692
01:59:54.341 --> 01:59:55.390
<v Speaker 5>What's beautiful music.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

01:59:56.111 --> 01:59:56.950
<v Speaker 5>it's like that,</v>

4695
01:59:57.010 --> 01:59:58.720
<v Speaker 5>that is what it's all about.</v>

4696
01:59:58.750 --> 02:00:00.670
<v Speaker 5>And unless you're doing that,</v>

4697
02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:04.570
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to be happy unless you're finding whenever the fuck it is in</v>

4698
02:00:04.571 --> 02:00:06.790
<v Speaker 5>life that makes you do something.</v>

4699
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:10.180
<v Speaker 5>And it always seems to have something to do with how other people appreciate</v>

4700
02:00:10.181 --> 02:00:10.960
<v Speaker 5>your work.</v>

4701
02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:12.250
<v Speaker 5>Cause it's like if you're a chef,</v>

4702
02:00:12.251 --> 02:00:13.840
<v Speaker 5>you want people to appreciate your food.</v>

4703
02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:14.950
<v Speaker 5>If you're a carpenter,</v>

4704
02:00:14.951 --> 02:00:16.510
<v Speaker 5>you want to appreciate someone,</v>

4705
02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:17.600
<v Speaker 5>appreciate what you've done.</v>

4706
02:00:17.601 --> 02:00:18.610
<v Speaker 5>And you built this house.</v>

4707
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:23.020
<v Speaker 5>It always seems to have something to do with giving something or producing</v>

4708
02:00:23.021 --> 02:00:25.690
<v Speaker 5>something and creating something that other people feel good about.</v>

4709
02:00:25.810 --> 02:00:28.750
<v Speaker 5>Whether you're a lawyer who gets guy out of a tricky situation because you</v>

4710
02:00:28.751 --> 02:00:29.710
<v Speaker 5>really love the law.</v>

4711
02:00:29.711 --> 02:00:31.060
<v Speaker 5>You have this passion for the law,</v>

4712
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:32.051
<v Speaker 5>like whatever it is,</v>

4713
02:00:32.051 --> 02:00:36.820
<v Speaker 5>it always seems to come down to how much passion do you have for for it and how</v>

4714
02:00:36.821 --> 02:00:39.040
<v Speaker 5>much does it have positively affect people.</v>

4715
02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:42.400
<v Speaker 5>That's like how you got to kind of structure your life and that's why a lot of</v>

4716
02:00:42.401 --> 02:00:45.070
<v Speaker 5>people get really lost and they just try to do things for themselves.</v>

4717
02:00:45.190 --> 02:00:47.860
<v Speaker 5>They just try to get ahead for themselves and just try to do well for</v>

4718
02:00:47.861 --> 02:00:48.670
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

4719
02:00:48.670 --> 02:00:52.480
<v Speaker 5>And in doing so you're like a person who's got like this and massive vitamin</v>

4720
02:00:52.481 --> 02:00:52.991
<v Speaker 5>deficiency.</v>

4721
02:00:52.991 --> 02:00:55.000
<v Speaker 5>Like you're taking all this vitamin D and you're taking all those,</v>

4722
02:00:55.001 --> 02:00:56.110
<v Speaker 5>but you don't have any sea.</v>

4723
02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:57.150
<v Speaker 5>There's no senior,</v>

4724
02:00:57.150 --> 02:00:57.611
<v Speaker 5>your system,</v>

4725
02:00:57.611 --> 02:01:00.280
<v Speaker 5>you're missing vitamin love like everything you're doing.</v>

4726
02:01:00.281 --> 02:01:02.980
<v Speaker 5>It's like a forward move me,</v>

4727
02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:04.640
<v Speaker 5>myself and Ah,</v>

4728
02:01:04.930 --> 02:01:07.270
<v Speaker 5>I will cause shellfish till you know,</v>

4729
02:01:07.271 --> 02:01:08.140
<v Speaker 5>till I make it.</v>

4730
02:01:08.230 --> 02:01:09.730
<v Speaker 5>I don't have time to be nice,</v>

4731
02:01:09.850 --> 02:01:10.571
<v Speaker 5>but you don't understand.</v>

4732
02:01:10.571 --> 02:01:11.500
<v Speaker 5>You don't have a choice.</v>

4733
02:01:11.590 --> 02:01:12.670
<v Speaker 5>You will not be happy.</v>

4734
02:01:12.671 --> 02:01:14.200
<v Speaker 5>You won't be successful if you make it,</v>

4735
02:01:14.201 --> 02:01:14.921
<v Speaker 5>you'll be miserable.</v>

4736
02:01:14.921 --> 02:01:17.620
<v Speaker 5>You wind up fucked up on booze or drugs or whatever.</v>

4737
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:18.040
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

4738
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:19.540
<v Speaker 5>you're at an imbalance point.</v>

4739
02:01:19.541 --> 02:01:21.340
<v Speaker 5>If you're thinking solely of yourself,</v>

4740
02:01:21.550 --> 02:01:25.570
<v Speaker 5>it's like your greatest work and your greatest feelings will all come and</v>

4741
02:01:25.571 --> 02:01:28.540
<v Speaker 5>creating something that you're passionate about that other people are going to</v>

4742
02:01:28.541 --> 02:01:29.220
<v Speaker 5>enjoy.</v>

4743
02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:29.981
<v Speaker 5>It seems to be,</v>

4744
02:01:29.981 --> 02:01:30.820
<v Speaker 5>that's like the,</v>

4745
02:01:30.821 --> 02:01:35.500
<v Speaker 5>that is a big key to life that it has to be to really truly be a happy person.</v>

4746
02:01:35.501 --> 02:01:38.140
<v Speaker 5>You have to be doing something that other people are enjoying as well.</v>

4747
02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:38.830
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

4748
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 5>There's fucking doubt about</v>

4749
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:40.410
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

4750
02:01:40.410 --> 02:01:42.710
<v Speaker 2>That's because like when I hear people take antidepressants,</v>

4751
02:01:42.711 --> 02:01:42.951
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4752
02:01:42.951 --> 02:01:43.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4753
02:01:43.370 --> 02:01:44.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any,</v>

4754
02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:47.060
<v Speaker 2>any imbalance and he mental about that I know of,</v>

4755
02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:49.130
<v Speaker 2>but if I do it workable,</v>

4756
02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:49.760
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

4757
02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:52.310
<v Speaker 2>But when I hear people taking things to make them happy,</v>

4758
02:01:52.311 --> 02:01:52.640
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

4759
02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:53.061
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

4760
02:01:53.061 --> 02:01:53.391
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4761
02:01:53.391 --> 02:01:53.641
<v Speaker 2>Match.</v>

4762
02:01:53.641 --> 02:01:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Then imagine not being happy.</v>

4763
02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:57.830
<v Speaker 2>Imagine like spending most of your time not being,</v>

4764
02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:59.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel that because I'm happy all the time.</v>

4765
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.561
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4766
02:02:00.561 --> 02:02:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not happy all the time.</v>

4767
02:02:01.961 --> 02:02:02.171
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4768
02:02:02.171 --> 02:02:03.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty happy person.</v>

4769
02:02:03.201 --> 02:02:04.130
<v Speaker 2>And people have said that to me.</v>

4770
02:02:04.131 --> 02:02:04.401
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

4771
02:02:04.401 --> 02:02:04.471

02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4782
02:02:12.711 --> 02:02:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4783
02:02:12.860 --> 02:02:15.590
<v Speaker 2>I tried to find all the things that make me happy.</v>

4784
02:02:15.591 --> 02:02:17.270
<v Speaker 2>I go surfing and makes me happy.</v>

4785
02:02:17.490 --> 02:02:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I go workout at the gym.</v>

4786
02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:19.130
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

4787
02:02:19.130 --> 02:02:19.941
<v Speaker 2>I love my girlfriend.</v>

4788
02:02:19.941 --> 02:02:20.751
<v Speaker 2>She makes me happy.</v>

4789
02:02:20.751 --> 02:02:21.350
<v Speaker 2>I found her,</v>

4790
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4791
02:02:21.591 --> 02:02:22.850
<v Speaker 2>like my dogs.</v>

4792
02:02:22.851 --> 02:02:23.684
<v Speaker 2>They make me happy.</v>

4793
02:02:23.810 --> 02:02:25.100
<v Speaker 2>I go out and hang out with my friends.</v>

4794
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Like do the things that make you fucking happy.</v>

4795
02:02:27.730 --> 02:02:28.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like when people go,</v>

4796
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.751
<v Speaker 2>I hate my job.</v>

4797
02:02:29.751 --> 02:02:31.340
<v Speaker 2>I hate my life fucking chain.</v>

4798
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:32.203
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

4799
02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes you can.</v>

4800
02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:34.360
<v Speaker 2>This way,</v>

4801
02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:35.193
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy.</v>

4802
02:02:35.210 --> 02:02:36.200
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly not easy to,</v>

4803
02:02:36.201 --> 02:02:37.034
<v Speaker 2>it depends on how,</v>

4804
02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:37.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4805
02:02:37.401 --> 02:02:39.620
<v Speaker 2>if you swam all the way out to the middle of the ocean and go,</v>

4806
02:02:39.621 --> 02:02:40.610
<v Speaker 2>I got to get back to shore.</v>

4807
02:02:40.670 --> 02:02:41.300
<v Speaker 2>I can't you,</v>

4808
02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:41.870

<v Speaker 2>you got here,</v>

4810
02:02:43.010 --> 02:02:44.000
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take a long time.</v>

4811
02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4812
02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:45.950
<v Speaker 2>You got to get better the same way you got sick.</v>

4813
02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4814
02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:48.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy to get back to shore,</v>

4815
02:02:48.410 --> 02:02:49.041
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4816
02:02:49.041 --> 02:02:53.090
<v Speaker 2>if you would swam only a few feet and didn't get a mortgage and didn't have kids</v>

4817
02:02:53.091 --> 02:02:55.280
<v Speaker 2>and didn't have 20 years and waiting for your pension,</v>

4818
02:02:55.281 --> 02:02:57.620
<v Speaker 2>and then if you just get out in six years,</v>

4819
02:02:57.621 --> 02:02:59.390
<v Speaker 2>then you'll have full health insurance until you're dead.</v>

4820
02:02:59.660 --> 02:02:59.931
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4821
02:02:59.931 --> 02:03:00.231
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

4822
02:03:00.231 --> 02:03:03.710
<v Speaker 2>there's people that like cannot ever pull the trigger to jettison themselves.</v>

4823
02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:07.370
<v Speaker 2>I just had this argument with a friend who was telling me they're depressed and</v>

4824
02:03:07.371 --> 02:03:07.851
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

02:03:22.521 --> 02:03:23.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to say let's,</v>

4843
02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:24.950
<v Speaker 2>let's find the past.</v>

4844
02:03:24.951 --> 02:03:25.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4845
02:03:25.371 --> 02:03:25.641
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4846
02:03:25.641 --> 02:03:26.091
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

4847
02:03:26.091 --> 02:03:26.780
<v Speaker 2>That's not the thing.</v>

4848
02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:27.261
<v Speaker 2>This is not you.</v>

4849
02:03:27.261 --> 02:03:30.090
<v Speaker 2>One universal thing you say to someone that's depressed and I haven't yet.</v>

4850
02:03:30.091 --> 02:03:32.960
<v Speaker 2>I haven't read the book about what I'm not supposed to say to people that are</v>

4851
02:03:32.961 --> 02:03:33.500
<v Speaker 2>depressed.</v>

4852
02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going on in someone's head cause I know for sure I'm wired</v>

4853
02:03:37.551 --> 02:03:38.540
<v Speaker 2>different than other people.</v>

4854
02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:41.870
<v Speaker 2>I've reacted different and how much of it is nature,</v>

4855
02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:44.990
<v Speaker 2>how much of it is nurture the fuck do I know?</v>

4856
02:03:44.991 --> 02:03:46.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think that's an exact science,</v>

4857
02:03:46.761 --> 02:03:47.211
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

4858
02:03:47.211 --> 02:03:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot,</v>

4859
02:03:48.150 --> 02:03:49.530
<v Speaker 2>a lot going on in the,</v>

4860
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:51.530
<v Speaker 2>in the school of Psychology,</v>

4861
02:03:51.531 --> 02:03:52.450
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of,</v>

4862
02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:54.200
<v Speaker 2>it's theoretical and there's a lot of,</v>

4863
02:03:54.530 --> 02:03:55.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of shit going on.</v>

4864
02:03:55.551 --> 02:03:58.460
<v Speaker 2>There's still don't know exactly why a person is the way they are.</v>

4865
02:03:58.461 --> 02:04:00.030
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what the fuck makes somebody happy.</v>

4866
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen the stuff that did the teachers,</v>

4867
02:04:02.631 --> 02:04:04.040
<v Speaker 2>the class on happiness at Harvard,</v>

4868
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:05.770
<v Speaker 2>he teaches a class.</v>

4869
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:06.710
<v Speaker 2>There's a class,</v>

4870
02:04:06.740 --> 02:04:07.281
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

4871
02:04:07.281 --> 02:04:09.860
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Harvard business school and you can watch some of his stuff.</v>

4872
02:04:09.861 --> 02:04:11.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what would make me happy.</v>

4873
02:04:11.361 --> 02:04:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Teaching a class on being happy would not make me happy.</v>

4874
02:04:15.710 --> 02:04:15.861
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4875
02:04:15.861 --> 02:04:16.250
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

4876
02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:16.420
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4877
02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:18.140
<v Speaker 2>but when he talks about some cool shit,</v>

4878
02:04:18.170 --> 02:04:22.660
<v Speaker 2>he apparently it's like the most coveted class at Harvard like itself.</v>

4879
02:04:22.730 --> 02:04:25.790
<v Speaker 2>Like it signs up and you can't get into it cause it's the first one is easy</v>

4880
02:04:25.791 --> 02:04:26.790
<v Speaker 2>credit that</v>

4881
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:29.890
<v Speaker 2>makes you happy.</v>

4882
02:04:30.190 --> 02:04:32.020
<v Speaker 2>But he's got something like he's young,</v>

4883
02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:34.850
<v Speaker 2>he's done a lot of studies on happiness,</v>

4884
02:04:34.851 --> 02:04:35.840
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty amazing.</v>

4885
02:04:35.841 --> 02:04:36.890
<v Speaker 2>And he starts stuff like,</v>

4886
02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:37.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4887
02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:38.393
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

4888
02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:39.151
<v Speaker 3>one of them was,</v>

4889
02:04:39.151 --> 02:04:41.430
<v Speaker 3>he said that after $70,000,</v>

4890
02:04:41.431 --> 02:04:42.360
<v Speaker 3>like in America,</v>

4891
02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:43.950
<v Speaker 3>after you make so many thousand dollars,</v>

4892
02:04:43.951 --> 02:04:44.760
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

4893
02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:47.280
<v Speaker 3>your happiness is not congruent with your,</v>

4894
02:04:47.370 --> 02:04:48.810
<v Speaker 3>with your financial level.</v>

4895
02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:49.530
<v Speaker 3>That's bullshit.</v>

4896
02:04:49.530 --> 02:04:50.920
<v Speaker 3>That means you've got a bad friend,</v>

4897
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:55.320
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know what the fuck you talking about.</v>

4898
02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:56.160
<v Speaker 3>Who you hanging out with,</v>

4899
02:04:56.161 --> 02:04:56.760
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

4900
02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:57.391
<v Speaker 3>what else or something.</v>

4901
02:04:57.391 --> 02:04:58.770
<v Speaker 3>We can do some damage with some money.</v>

4902
02:04:58.800 --> 02:04:59.341
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>

4903
02:04:59.341 --> 02:04:59.731
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>

4904
02:04:59.731 --> 02:05:01.170
<v Speaker 3>I got a friend who has,</v>

4905
02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:02.610
<v Speaker 3>who literally is a,</v>

4906
02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:04.350
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't even talk about this.</v>

4907
02:05:04.351 --> 02:05:04.981
<v Speaker 3>I'll let you say,</v>

4908
02:05:04.981 --> 02:05:06.540
<v Speaker 3>I've got to figure out how to filter it.</v>

4909
02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:08.460
<v Speaker 3>I got a friend with a lot of money,</v>

4910
02:05:08.730 --> 02:05:13.730
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of money and this friend use the money.</v>

4911
02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:15.180
<v Speaker 3>For awhile he didn't.</v>

4912
02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:16.141
<v Speaker 3>And then I was like,</v>

4913
02:05:16.141 --> 02:05:16.860
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

4914
02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:19.440
<v Speaker 3>do you know what you can get with what you have?</v>

4915
02:05:19.710 --> 02:05:23.840
<v Speaker 3>And then it clicked one day and then he had slipped and slides on the top floor.</v>

4916
02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:26.400
<v Speaker 3>The fucking win with chicks naked,</v>

4917
02:05:26.401 --> 02:05:27.960
<v Speaker 3>fucking running down the slip and slide.</v>

4918
02:05:28.290 --> 02:05:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Well fucking uh,</v>

4919
02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:30.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4920
02:05:30.630 --> 02:05:35.580
<v Speaker 3>midgets dressed in or little people dressed in storm trooper outfits are serving</v>

4921
02:05:35.581 --> 02:05:36.330
<v Speaker 3>him drinks.</v>

4922
02:05:36.330 --> 02:05:36.960
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

4923
02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:39.040
<v Speaker 3>Like he went and did it as a no,</v>

4924
02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:39.990
<v Speaker 3>but I mean he just,</v>

4925
02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:43.230
<v Speaker 3>he just did the Michael Jackson thing where you have so much money.</v>

4926
02:05:43.231 --> 02:05:43.500
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

4927
02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:46.610
<v Speaker 3>I want to live in a tree and I want to have a monkey and I want to have,</v>

4928
02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:47.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4929
02:05:47.071 --> 02:05:49.890
<v Speaker 3>like you just started going fucking crazy and like,</v>

4930
02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:53.170
<v Speaker 3>let's see how we can just spend this money and you know,</v>

4931
02:05:53.190 --> 02:05:53.941
<v Speaker 3>the next thing you know,</v>

4932
02:05:53.941 --> 02:05:55.500
<v Speaker 3>he's just totally fucked up.</v>

4933
02:05:55.530 --> 02:05:55.831
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4934
02:05:55.831 --> 02:05:56.530
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

4935
02:05:56.530 --> 02:05:57.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4936
02:05:57.141 --> 02:05:57.974
<v Speaker 3>there's just,</v>

4937
02:05:58.510 --> 02:06:00.090

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4939
02:06:00.541 --> 02:06:02.430
<v Speaker 3>he ended up in Rehab and all kinds of shit.</v>

4940
02:06:02.431 --> 02:06:06.090
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't happen when you're looking for that empty happiness or you're</v>

4941
02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:08.040
<v Speaker 3>looking for happiness through substances.</v>

4942
02:06:08.130 --> 02:06:08.941
<v Speaker 3>You know when people say,</v>

4943
02:06:08.941 --> 02:06:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4944
02:06:09.150 --> 02:06:10.070
<v Speaker 3>you're a hypocrite dude,</v>

4945
02:06:10.071 --> 02:06:11.160
<v Speaker 3>you're getting high all the time.</v>

4946
02:06:11.670 --> 02:06:12.480
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

4947
02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:13.710
<v Speaker 3>I take weeks off.</v>

4948
02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:15.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to get high all the time.</v>

4949
02:06:15.210 --> 02:06:16.050
<v Speaker 3>I liked it in high.</v>

4950
02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:17.333
<v Speaker 3>It's good for you.</v>

4951
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.660
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

4952
02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:21.660
<v Speaker 3>I think marijuana is one of the only vices that I really don't have any problem</v>

4953
02:06:21.661 --> 02:06:21.830
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

4954
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:25.440
<v Speaker 3>As long as you'd get all your other shit done in your life and you use it to</v>

4955
02:06:25.441 --> 02:06:27.300
<v Speaker 3>enhance things that your dad was just going to say.</v>

4956
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:32.130
<v Speaker 3>But my agent in Australia is the fucking greatest guy that's ever lived and my</v>

4957
02:06:32.131 --> 02:06:37.131
<v Speaker 3>agent gets everything done on all the time and he's fucking amazing.</v>

4958
02:06:37.171 --> 02:06:37.431
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4959
02:06:37.431 --> 02:06:37.670
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4960
02:06:37.670 --> 02:06:38.640
<v Speaker 3>and he joked with,</v>

4961
02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:42.200
<v Speaker 3>he wants and he said about like getting high like you can be productive on ma.</v>

4962
02:06:42.270 --> 02:06:43.650
<v Speaker 3>I know so many math,</v>

4963
02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:46.470
<v Speaker 3>like productive fucking people with marijuana,</v>

4964
02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:47.670
<v Speaker 3>super productive.</v>

4965
02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:52.940
<v Speaker 3>A lot of writers beyond like people get you to like the mentality I am.</v>

4966
02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:55.380
<v Speaker 3>If I smoked pot,</v>

4967
02:06:55.381 --> 02:06:59.400
<v Speaker 3>I'd be way more productive because when I used to smoke it I was better.</v>

4968
02:06:59.460 --> 02:06:59.750
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

4969
02:06:59.750 --> 02:07:00.583
<v Speaker 3>I just can't smell.</v>

4970
02:07:00.730 --> 02:07:02.810
<v Speaker 3>When you said one bad thing that too,</v>

4971
02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:03.713
<v Speaker 3>did you uh,</v>

4972
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:05.400

4973
02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:08.130
<v Speaker 3>We talked about this on the green room.</v>

4974
02:07:08.670 --> 02:07:09.341
<v Speaker 3>He tweeted me,</v>

4975
02:07:09.341 --> 02:07:10.320
<v Speaker 3>he was in horror,</v>

4976
02:07:10.690 --> 02:07:12.020
<v Speaker 3>just couch law.</v>

4977
02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Joe was my go to guy and I thought here's a guy that's going to talk me down off</v>

4978
02:07:16.801 --> 02:07:17.520

02:07:20.331 --> 02:07:21.164
<v Speaker 3>and it could be like,</v>

4983
02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:24.540
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of people say milk helps you when you have like a bachelor from</v>

4984
02:07:24.541 --> 02:07:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Sherman and even if it doesn't,</v>

4985
02:07:26.251 --> 02:07:27.061
<v Speaker 3>you have that in your head.</v>

4986
02:07:27.061 --> 02:07:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Somebody told you milk milk around,</v>

4987
02:07:29.071 --> 02:07:29.910
<v Speaker 3>you ever have that happen again?</v>

4988
02:07:29.911 --> 02:07:30.750
<v Speaker 3>You drink a glass of milk,</v>

4989
02:07:30.751 --> 02:07:31.584
<v Speaker 3>you'll feel it.</v>

4990
02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:34.380
<v Speaker 3>I started getting panic attacks from it and people told me,</v>

4991
02:07:34.381 --> 02:07:36.190
<v Speaker 3>like Bert told me to get</v>

4992
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:38.410
<v Speaker 2>a w with Xanax and I'm like,</v>

4993
02:07:38.770 --> 02:07:39.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm not taking Xanax.</v>

4994
02:07:40.140 --> 02:07:40.973
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

4995
02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:42.293
<v Speaker 2>stick with the milk.</v>

4996
02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:43.121
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

4997
02:07:43.121 --> 02:07:43.631
<v Speaker 2>take Xanax.</v>

4998
02:07:43.631 --> 02:07:43.871
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4999
02:07:43.871 --> 02:07:44.681
<v Speaker 2>I'm not taking Xanax.</v>

5000
02:07:44.681 --> 02:07:45.101
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

5001
02:07:45.101 --> 02:07:46.270
<v Speaker 2>he just put in your pocket.</v>

5002
02:07:46.271 --> 02:07:46.870
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

5003
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:47.860
<v Speaker 2>you don't ever use it,</v>

5005
02:07:48.010 --> 02:07:49.150
<v Speaker 2>but you know it's there.</v>

5006
02:07:49.151 --> 02:07:50.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's silly bitch.</v>

5007
02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:53.350
<v Speaker 2>I think Burt was the one who told me that sounds like,</v>

5008

5037
02:08:30.710 --> 02:08:32.680
<v Speaker 2>like you couldn't have fly so much,</v>

5038
02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:33.461
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

5039
02:08:33.461 --> 02:08:33.601
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

5040
02:08:33.601 --> 02:08:33.970
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

5041
02:08:33.970 --> 02:08:34.803

5043
02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:37.690
<v Speaker 2>I like when we take off.</v>

5044
02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:38.920
<v Speaker 2>I like when I don't,</v>

5045
02:08:38.921 --> 02:08:40.360
<v Speaker 2>like when we pull up the gate and they're like,</v>

5046
02:08:40.630 --> 02:08:40.871
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5047
02:08:40.871 --> 02:08:43.480
<v Speaker 2>we're not gonna be able to pull into the gate for another 20 minutes.</v>

5048
02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:44.740
<v Speaker 2>That's when I'm like,</v>

5049
02:08:44.741 --> 02:08:47.170
<v Speaker 2>what is it about complete fucking control?</v>

5050
02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:48.251
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

5051
02:08:48.251 --> 02:08:49.240
<v Speaker 2>It is a control freak.</v>

5052
02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:50.113
<v Speaker 2>He got to,</v>

5053
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:52.130
<v Speaker 2>someone said something to me a long time ago,</v>

5054
02:08:52.131 --> 02:08:53.320
<v Speaker 2>this comedian Tony v,</v>

5055
02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:54.310
<v Speaker 2>and it literally,</v>

5056
02:08:54.311 --> 02:08:56.440
<v Speaker 2>it became a tool that I use in my life.</v>

5057
02:08:56.710 --> 02:09:00.220
<v Speaker 2>He was driving back and forth from Boston to New York on a regular basis and</v>

5058
02:09:00.221 --> 02:09:01.120
<v Speaker 2>that's a long drive.</v>

5059
02:09:01.121 --> 02:09:02.230
<v Speaker 2>A couple hours at least,</v>

5060
02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:03.220
<v Speaker 2>even if you're going fast.</v>

5061
02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:04.061
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

5062
02:09:04.061 --> 02:09:04.271
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5063
02:09:04.271 --> 02:09:04.511
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

5064
02:09:04.511 --> 02:09:06.130
<v Speaker 2>how are you doing that every day?</v>

5065
02:09:06.490 --> 02:09:07.120
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

5066
02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I just go zen.</v>

5067
02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:08.771
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

5068
02:09:08.771 --> 02:09:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm in my car and I go,</v>

5069
02:09:09.821 --> 02:09:10.810
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm doing.</v>

5070
02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm driving the car.</v>

5071
02:09:11.890 --> 02:09:12.460
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

5072
02:09:12.460 --> 02:09:13.180
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

5073
02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:15.580
<v Speaker 2>that's how much time it takes and I don't worry about it.</v>

5074
02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:16.413
<v Speaker 2>I just do it.</v>

5075
02:09:16.570 --> 02:09:16.961
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

5076
02:09:16.961 --> 02:09:17.141
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

5077
02:09:17.141 --> 02:09:18.700
<v Speaker 2>that is the way to think about it.</v>

5078
02:09:18.701 --> 02:09:19.451
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>

5079
02:09:19.451 --> 02:09:20.360
<v Speaker 2>it's like you'd start doubling,</v>

5080
02:09:20.420 --> 02:09:20.951
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

5081
02:09:20.951 --> 02:09:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Why don't they pull this thing,</v>

5082
02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:25.240
<v Speaker 2>then you realize like how much energy is wasted on something that you're never</v>

5083
02:09:25.241 --> 02:09:27.070
<v Speaker 2>going to have any effect on it whatsoever.</v>

5084
02:09:27.250 --> 02:09:28.870
<v Speaker 2>And if it takes two hours to drive somewhere,</v>

5085
02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:32.830
<v Speaker 2>it takes two hours to drive somewhere unless you hit a fucking wormhole and find</v>

5086
02:09:32.831 --> 02:09:34.180
<v Speaker 2>yourself on the other side somehow,</v>

5087
02:09:34.670 --> 02:09:35.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5088
02:09:35.230 --> 02:09:36.730
<v Speaker 2>it takes two hours to drive there.</v>

5089
02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:37.950
<v Speaker 2>You just have to go zen.</v>

5090
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:38.321
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

5091
02:09:38.321 --> 02:09:39.130
<v Speaker 2>it's a tool.</v>

5092
02:09:39.130 --> 02:09:40.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a tool I use now.</v>

5093
02:09:40.450 --> 02:09:43.390
<v Speaker 2>So whenever I'm in any sort of a situation where,</v>

5094
02:09:43.391 --> 02:09:43.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5095
02:09:43.890 --> 02:09:46.330
<v Speaker 2>if it's bad weather or if it's what I just go,</v>

5096
02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:47.500
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm doing now.</v>

5097
02:09:48.070 --> 02:09:51.130
<v Speaker 3>I heard some fucked up shit recently about flying and pilots.</v>

5098
02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:52.860
<v Speaker 3>This girl I know told me that like,</v>

5099
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:53.800
<v Speaker 3>I can't say who it is,</v>

5100
02:09:53.801 --> 02:09:55.210
<v Speaker 3>I can't say what airline or whenever,</v>

5101
02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:58.270
<v Speaker 3>but she knows it's a pilot and uh,</v>

5102
02:09:58.450 --> 02:09:59.231
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

5103
02:09:59.231 --> 02:10:01.360
<v Speaker 3>he was talking about how like how you had to go to work and he,</v>

5104
02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:01.970
<v Speaker 3>and she goes,</v>

5105
02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:02.061
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5106
02:10:02.061 --> 02:10:02.681
<v Speaker 3>that sucks.</v>

5107
02:10:02.681 --> 02:10:03.790
<v Speaker 3>I get tired and she goes out.</v>

5108
02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:04.241
<v Speaker 3>He goes like,</v>

5109
02:10:04.241 --> 02:10:06.220
<v Speaker 3>that's why I can't wait to go flying's like that's what,</v>

5110
02:10:06.221 --> 02:10:07.360
<v Speaker 3>when I get the best sleep,</v>

5111
02:10:07.570 --> 02:10:09.400
<v Speaker 3>I guess like when they take off the,</v>

5112
02:10:09.410 --> 02:10:12.130
<v Speaker 3>and then the copilot is fucking sit there and push a button,</v>

5113
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:13.180
<v Speaker 3>go to sleep,</v>

5114
02:10:13.181 --> 02:10:14.560
<v Speaker 3>and they get wake woken up,</v>

5115
02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:15.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5116
02:10:15.131 --> 02:10:15.780
<v Speaker 3>when her,</v>

5117
02:10:15.780 --> 02:10:16.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5118
02:10:16.570 --> 02:10:17.710
<v Speaker 3>like near the city.</v>

5119
02:10:17.970 --> 02:10:18.803
<v Speaker 3>Why is it scary?</v>

5120
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:19.870
<v Speaker 3>Because that's just like,</v>

5121
02:10:19.871 --> 02:10:22.180
<v Speaker 3>if you imagine like going into a cockpit of an airplane,</v>

5122
02:10:22.181 --> 02:10:23.490
<v Speaker 3>everyone's fucking sleeping.</v>

5123
02:10:24.630 --> 02:10:24.840
<v Speaker 3>One</v>

5124
02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:26.550
<v Speaker 2>guy stays awake at a time.</v>

5125
02:10:26.551 --> 02:10:27.930
<v Speaker 2>I think they probably do shifts.</v>

5126
02:10:28.140 --> 02:10:28.411
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

5127
02:10:28.411 --> 02:10:28.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5128
02:10:28.710 --> 02:10:29.330
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>

5129
02:10:29.330 --> 02:10:32.010
<v Speaker 2>the way those autopilot things work,</v>

5130
02:10:32.011 --> 02:10:34.670
<v Speaker 2>unless there's a situation where they're running the crazy weather and they wake</v>

5131
02:10:34.671 --> 02:10:35.504
<v Speaker 2>right the fuck up.</v>

5132
02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:36.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't really think it's that big of a deal.</v>

5133
02:10:36.951 --> 02:10:37.850
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it should be,</v>

5134
02:10:37.851 --> 02:10:38.780
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

5135
02:10:38.781 --> 02:10:39.501
<v Speaker 2>it's just all like,</v>

5136
02:10:39.501 --> 02:10:40.940
<v Speaker 2>you're driving on a windy road,</v>

5137
02:10:40.941 --> 02:10:42.470
<v Speaker 2>you're just flying in a direction.</v>

5138
02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:44.930
<v Speaker 2>They put it on autopilot and it just fucking guess.</v>

5139
02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:48.110
<v Speaker 2>I knew a chick who's a pilot who,</v>

5140
02:10:48.490 --> 02:10:49.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5141
02:10:49.210 --> 02:10:49.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5142
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:50.720
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not going to tell you the airline,</v>

5143
02:10:50.721 --> 02:10:51.441
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>

5144
02:10:51.441 --> 02:10:52.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5145
02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:57.220
<v Speaker 2>she fucked another pilot while they were flying commercial airline.</v>

5146
02:10:57.501 --> 02:10:58.280
<v Speaker 2>What a dirty,</v>

5147
02:10:58.280 --> 02:10:59.630
<v Speaker 2>and she wasn't flying the big ones,</v>

5148
02:10:59.631 --> 02:11:03.170
<v Speaker 2>but she was flying like maybe like a two and a one like two seats on one side,</v>

5149
02:11:03.171 --> 02:11:05.420
<v Speaker 2>one on the other leagues.</v>

5150
02:11:05.450 --> 02:11:09.800
<v Speaker 2>She's up there fucking riding a dude who I know and I thought about that.</v>

5151
02:11:09.801 --> 02:11:10.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5152
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:11.090
<v Speaker 2>I would like that.</v>

5153
02:11:11.090 --> 02:11:13.910
<v Speaker 2>I would like to know that if there's a female pilot up there,</v>

5154
02:11:14.090 --> 02:11:15.380
<v Speaker 2>she's fucking up there.</v>

5155
02:11:15.381 --> 02:11:16.430
<v Speaker 2>That makes me feel good.</v>

5156
02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Are you should,</v>

5158
02:11:20.690 --> 02:11:22.670

5159
02:11:22.700 --> 02:11:23.061

<v Speaker 2>Don't do this right now.</v>

5169
02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Jim Jefferies was on a plane.</v>

5170
02:11:39.090 --> 02:11:41.040
<v Speaker 2>That dude died.</v>

02:11:45.410 --> 02:11:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

02:11:55.281 --> 02:11:59.540
<v Speaker 2>they like took him to the back and covered them with like a blanket and I'm</v>

5179
02:11:59.541 --> 02:12:00.020
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

5180

02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God fucking car.</v>

5185
02:12:06.110 --> 02:12:07.490
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine.</v>

5186
02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I watched the lady go into a seizure and was really creepy man.</v>

5187
02:12:10.431 --> 02:12:11.264
<v Speaker 2>It was weird.</v>

5188
02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:14.630
<v Speaker 2>It was right after September 11th so she was right behind on a plane.</v>

5189
02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5190
02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:17.840
<v Speaker 2>She starts to start seizuring and they go,</v>

5191
02:12:17.841 --> 02:12:18.381
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

5192
02:12:18.381 --> 02:12:19.190
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

5193
02:12:19.190 --> 02:12:19.821
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

5194
02:12:19.821 --> 02:12:22.460
<v Speaker 2>This happens sometimes I guess epileptic people,</v>

5195
02:12:22.461 --> 02:12:22.940
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

5196
02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:24.110
<v Speaker 2>they just go into seizures.</v>

5197
02:12:24.130 --> 02:12:24.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5198
02:12:24.590 --> 02:12:24.861
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5199
02:12:24.861 --> 02:12:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that a bunch.</v>

5200
02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:26.570
<v Speaker 2>My friend Jay,</v>

5201
02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Jay Helfrich,</v>

5202
02:12:27.660 --> 02:12:32.540
<v Speaker 2>he's a a pool player and spent most of his life like gambling and playing pool</v>

5203
02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:34.970
<v Speaker 2>is playing this guy and the middle is set.</v>

5204
02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:39.410
<v Speaker 2>The guy falls down to the ground and starts bucking and kick in and making these</v>

5205
02:12:39.411 --> 02:12:43.280
<v Speaker 2>noises and the guy was losing and he assumed that the guy was doing it to try to</v>

5206
02:12:43.281 --> 02:12:44.120
<v Speaker 2>get out of the game.</v>

5207
02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Cause like,</v>

5208
02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:45.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5209
02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:45.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5210
02:12:45.650 --> 02:12:45.831
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

5211
02:12:45.831 --> 02:12:47.180
<v Speaker 2>dudes will do things to shark.</v>

5212
02:12:47.180 --> 02:12:49.340
<v Speaker 2>You sure they'll do things to distract you.</v>

5213
02:12:49.490 --> 02:12:50.390
<v Speaker 2>And he was looking at it like,</v>

5214
02:12:50.391 --> 02:12:50.691
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

5215
02:12:50.691 --> 02:12:51.381
<v Speaker 2>this is a new one.</v>

5216
02:12:51.381 --> 02:12:52.970
<v Speaker 2>This guy is faking a seizure.</v>

5217
02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:56.630
<v Speaker 2>But really the guy was an epileptic and it was like a normal occurrence.</v>

5218
02:12:56.690 --> 02:12:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Like he'd be in the middle of his day and he would just fall to the ground and</v>

5219
02:12:59.841 --> 02:13:02.810
<v Speaker 2>start bucking and twitching and they didn't help him.</v>

5220
02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:04.490
<v Speaker 2>He didn't help him die.</v>

5221
02:13:04.491 --> 02:13:05.121
<v Speaker 2>Someone helped him.</v>

5222
02:13:05.121 --> 02:13:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Someone came over there.</v>

5223
02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:06.330
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

5224
02:13:06.330 --> 02:13:07.460
<v Speaker 2>there's a video on youtube,</v>

5225
02:13:07.461 --> 02:13:09.950
<v Speaker 2>I think you can find it and we played it on our podcast.</v>

5226
02:13:09.951 --> 02:13:12.290
<v Speaker 2>There's a comedian that died on stage in England,</v>

5227
02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:13.080
<v Speaker 2>died,</v>

5228
02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:14.480
<v Speaker 2>fell off the stage and died.</v>

5229
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Well fucking Gallagher's.</v>

5230
02:13:15.471 --> 02:13:16.980
<v Speaker 2>I like 18 heart attacks offstage.</v>

5231
02:13:17.110 --> 02:13:19.670
<v Speaker 2>Know this guy just fell off the back of the stage.</v>

5232
02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:21.560
<v Speaker 2>But he was that kind of comic too.</v>

5233
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:26.950
<v Speaker 2>So they think it's part of his act and then eventually his son runs on stage and</v>

5234
02:13:28.701 --> 02:13:29.451
<v Speaker 2>kind of is like,</v>

5235
02:13:29.451 --> 02:13:30.410
<v Speaker 2>this isn't a joke.</v>

5236
02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:32.160
<v Speaker 2>That'd be kind of a cool way to go.</v>

5237
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:33.143
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

5238
02:13:33.420 --> 02:13:34.320
<v Speaker 3>You know why not?</v>

5239
02:13:34.650 --> 02:13:38.490
<v Speaker 3>It's better than you would kind of ruin the show.</v>

5240
02:13:38.550 --> 02:13:39.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5241
02:13:39.330 --> 02:13:43.410
<v Speaker 3>maybe it would make it better with your bombing and that was how you pulled</v>

5242
02:13:43.411 --> 02:13:44.244
<v Speaker 3>yourself out of it.</v>

5243
02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5244
02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:47.730
<v Speaker 3>I saw a guy do that on a golf course.</v>

5245
02:13:47.731 --> 02:13:48.810
<v Speaker 3>Once he died,</v>

5246
02:13:48.811 --> 02:13:52.800
<v Speaker 3>he stayed at God know somebody misses a Putt and he just does a faint.</v>

5247
02:13:53.340 --> 02:13:56.130
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that's a fucking cool trick that like,</v>

5248
02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:00.210
<v Speaker 3>like you're going pretty far to like show how bad that affected you.</v>

5249
02:14:00.630 --> 02:14:04.680
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sitting there and all of a sudden I see a woman jump off like over the</v>

5250
02:14:04.681 --> 02:14:06.570
<v Speaker 3>railing of like a six foot high porch,</v>

5251
02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:09.420
<v Speaker 3>jump over it and just sprint down to it.</v>

5252
02:14:09.421 --> 02:14:10.254
<v Speaker 3>And I went,</v>

5253
02:14:10.290 --> 02:14:10.591
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5254
02:14:10.591 --> 02:14:11.190
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

5255
02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:13.800
<v Speaker 3>and so I just ran and called nine one one and I was like,</v>

5256
02:14:13.801 --> 02:14:14.640
<v Speaker 3>fuck man.</v>

5257
02:14:14.641 --> 02:14:15.900
<v Speaker 3>Amazone uh,</v>

5258
02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:16.530
<v Speaker 3>he died.</v>

5259
02:14:16.530 --> 02:14:18.690
<v Speaker 3>They said he was dead when he hit the ground,</v>

5260
02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:19.830
<v Speaker 3>which is heart attack or something.</v>

5261
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5262
02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:21.270
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it just stops,</v>

5263
02:14:21.271 --> 02:14:21.620
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5264
02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:25.260
<v Speaker 3>If a blow a piston in your car and just driving on the highway and bang black</v>

5265
02:14:25.261 --> 02:14:26.094
<v Speaker 3>smoke,</v>

5266
02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:28.050
<v Speaker 3>you pull over the side of the road.</v>

5267
02:14:28.110 --> 02:14:30.420
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever thought you were having a heart attack and then you burped?</v>

5268
02:14:31.140 --> 02:14:31.690
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

5269
02:14:31.690 --> 02:14:34.650
<v Speaker 3>I get indigestion and I've gotten a bad,</v>

5270
02:14:34.830 --> 02:14:37.110
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten into gestures so bad where I'm like,</v>

5271
02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:37.471
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

5272
02:14:37.471 --> 02:14:39.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting these like crippling chest pains.</v>

5273
02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:40.350
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

5274
02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:40.471
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5275
02:14:40.471 --> 02:14:41.161
<v Speaker 3>I guess this is it.</v>

5276
02:14:41.161 --> 02:14:41.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>

5277
02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:42.601
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

5278
02:14:42.601 --> 02:14:44.550
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden I'll burp and I'll be like,</v>

5279
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:45.623
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to live.</v>

5280
02:14:45.630 --> 02:14:45.841
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

5281
02:14:45.841 --> 02:14:46.051
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

5282
02:14:46.051 --> 02:14:46.550
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

5283
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:47.910
<v Speaker 3>We really have you ever had that?</v>

5284
02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:49.073
<v Speaker 3>I get it all the time.</v>

5285
02:14:49.710 --> 02:14:52.830
<v Speaker 3>I get my heart every day.</v>

5286
02:14:52.831 --> 02:14:53.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty good.</v>

5287
02:14:53.310 --> 02:14:55.740
<v Speaker 3>The heart beats freaks out.</v>

5288
02:14:56.860 --> 02:14:57.530
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

5289
02:14:57.530 --> 02:14:58.950
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly all because of like,</v>

5290
02:14:58.951 --> 02:14:59.581
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

5291
02:14:59.581 --> 02:15:00.930
<v Speaker 3>I had onions on my subway,</v>

5292
02:15:02.890 --> 02:15:04.170
<v Speaker 3>spoons can fuck shit.</v>

5293
02:15:04.171 --> 02:15:05.220
<v Speaker 3>Like that fucks me up.</v>

5294
02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:06.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5295
02:15:06.090 --> 02:15:07.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it anymore cause I'm,</v>

5296
02:15:07.650 --> 02:15:08.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm a nerd about my diet.</v>

5297
02:15:08.911 --> 02:15:10.890
<v Speaker 3>I eat the Paleo Diet and uh,</v>

5298
02:15:11.250 --> 02:15:12.570
<v Speaker 3>and I fucking am religious.</v>

5299
02:15:12.630 --> 02:15:15.930
<v Speaker 3>How did you become this fitness nut mean because you,</v>

5300
02:15:16.410 --> 02:15:19.020
<v Speaker 3>your choice of attack is like crossfit.</v>

5301
02:15:19.021 --> 02:15:20.190
<v Speaker 3>Like how did that I,</v>

5302
02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:23.730
<v Speaker 3>I ran track in college like all my life and then got into like,</v>

5303
02:15:23.731 --> 02:15:28.200
<v Speaker 3>I was an ocean lifeguard and I was doing like ocean lifeguarding competitions</v>

5304
02:15:28.201 --> 02:15:28.921
<v Speaker 3>and stuff like that.</v>

5305
02:15:28.921 --> 02:15:32.970
<v Speaker 3>And then I got into like triathlons and I was always doing it on the slide.</v>

5306
02:15:32.971 --> 02:15:35.430
<v Speaker 3>It was almost like I'd go out and party really fucking hard,</v>

5307
02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:37.620
<v Speaker 3>like really hard for like two weeks.</v>

5308
02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:38.880
<v Speaker 3>And then I would go like,</v>

5309
02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:40.950
<v Speaker 3>feel shit about myself and try to clean up.</v>

5310
02:15:41.490 --> 02:15:42.500
<v Speaker 3>And then I'd go like,</v>

5311
02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:44.190
<v Speaker 3>and it was like here and there,</v>

5312
02:15:44.191 --> 02:15:44.671
<v Speaker 3>here and there.</v>

5313
02:15:44.671 --> 02:15:46.380
<v Speaker 3>And then finally I just said,</v>

5314
02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:46.831
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

5315
02:15:46.831 --> 02:15:48.060
<v Speaker 3>this has got to fucking stop.</v>

5316
02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:48.893
<v Speaker 3>I'm a mess.</v>

5317
02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:50.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm a mess.</v>

5318
02:15:50.191 --> 02:15:51.024
<v Speaker 3>Like I was,</v>

5319
02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:51.780
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5320
02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:52.980
<v Speaker 3>when I'd go to the UK,</v>

5321
02:15:53.070 --> 02:15:56.760
<v Speaker 3>I'd spend three months over there where I would drink at lunch and we would go</v>

5322
02:15:56.761 --> 02:15:59.360
<v Speaker 3>out for lunch for beers and I would drink til show time,</v>

5323
02:15:59.610 --> 02:16:00.270
<v Speaker 3>drink,</v>

5324
02:16:00.270 --> 02:16:00.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5325
02:16:00.511 --> 02:16:03.090
<v Speaker 3>they bring me a couple of pints backstage at the show,</v>

5326
02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:03.931
<v Speaker 3>do the show,</v>

5327
02:16:03.931 --> 02:16:05.250
<v Speaker 3>and they go out and party all night.</v>

5328
02:16:05.550 --> 02:16:08.850
<v Speaker 3>And I'd come home from England just feeling like a piece of shit.</v>

5329
02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:10.073
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

5330
02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:10.801
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

5331
02:16:10.801 --> 02:16:11.210
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

5332
02:16:11.210 --> 02:16:12.300
<v Speaker 3>I better do something.</v>

5333
02:16:12.301 --> 02:16:13.230
<v Speaker 3>So I started,</v>

5334
02:16:13.231 --> 02:16:13.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5335
02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I started working out and then,</v>

5336
02:16:15.571 --> 02:16:16.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5337
02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:17.580
<v Speaker 3>I found that I was,</v>

5338
02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:18.650
<v Speaker 3>I liked bodywork.</v>

5339
02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:21.120
<v Speaker 3>Heck a body like body weight exercises like pull ups,</v>

5340
02:16:21.121 --> 02:16:21.541
<v Speaker 3>push ups,</v>

5341
02:16:21.541 --> 02:16:22.374
<v Speaker 3>sit ups stuff.</v>

5342
02:16:22.410 --> 02:16:25.260
<v Speaker 3>Cause I didn't want to get big and because I liked the run still and,</v>

5343
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:27.150
<v Speaker 3>and I found the navy seal workouts.</v>

5344
02:16:27.151 --> 02:16:30.370
<v Speaker 3>So I started doing navy seal workouts online and then they said,</v>

5345
02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:31.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5346
02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

5347
02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:32.740
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a workout today.</v>

5348
02:16:32.741 --> 02:16:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Go to crossfit.</v>

5349
02:16:33.670 --> 02:16:34.001
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

5350
02:16:34.001 --> 02:16:35.140
<v Speaker 2>what's this fucking crossfit thing?</v>

5351
02:16:35.141 --> 02:16:36.160
<v Speaker 2>So I went to crossfit.</v>

5352
02:16:36.610 --> 02:16:36.911
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5353
02:16:36.911 --> 02:16:39.160
<v Speaker 2>what is this fucking weird community of there?</v>

5354
02:16:39.490 --> 02:16:40.840
<v Speaker 2>And it's fucking weird dude.</v>

5355
02:16:40.841 --> 02:16:41.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a weird group of,</v>

5356
02:16:41.771 --> 02:16:43.570
<v Speaker 2>it was a weird group of people.</v>

5357
02:16:43.571 --> 02:16:44.110
<v Speaker 2>The ideas,</v>

5358
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:45.510
<v Speaker 2>there are different exercises every day,</v>

5359
02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:46.490
<v Speaker 2>every day you're shopping,</v>

5360
02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:49.330
<v Speaker 2>you're just a shocking your system with metabolic conditioning.</v>

5361
02:16:49.331 --> 02:16:50.740
<v Speaker 2>It's combination of gymnastics,</v>

5362
02:16:50.741 --> 02:16:52.030
<v Speaker 2>weight lifting and sprinting.</v>

5363
02:16:52.420 --> 02:16:53.380
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

5364
02:16:53.950 --> 02:16:55.120
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

5365
02:16:55.310 --> 02:16:58.090
<v Speaker 2>it's the whole idea is the prepare for the unknowing.</v>

5366
02:16:58.120 --> 02:16:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Like you never know what you're going to get.</v>

5367
02:16:59.801 --> 02:17:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Like in weightlifting,</v>

5368
02:17:00.671 --> 02:17:03.880
<v Speaker 2>you might do your legs one day and then you take a week break to let your</v>

5369
02:17:03.881 --> 02:17:04.840
<v Speaker 2>muscles recuperate.</v>

5370
02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:05.853
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a,</v>

5371
02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:06.580
<v Speaker 2>an uh,</v>

5372
02:17:06.580 --> 02:17:10.360
<v Speaker 2>mixed martial arts guy or a cop or fireman or a military guy,</v>

5373
02:17:10.570 --> 02:17:12.330
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what's happening day to.</v>

5374
02:17:12.730 --> 02:17:17.310
<v Speaker 2>So they might throw fucking legs at you day two and day three like you don't,</v>

5375
02:17:17.470 --> 02:17:18.170
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>

5376
02:17:18.170 --> 02:17:19.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not good though.</v>

5377
02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Not good in one aspect but good in another.</v>

5378
02:17:21.131 --> 02:17:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Your adaptation levels start getting higher and higher.</v>

5379
02:17:24.670 --> 02:17:25.480
<v Speaker 2>Your ligaments,</v>

5380
02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:25.750
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5381
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:26.650
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily.</v>

5382
02:17:26.651 --> 02:17:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Because if you learn good form,</v>

5383
02:17:28.541 --> 02:17:32.290
<v Speaker 2>which is what they try to teach you is learn the proper technique and then you</v>

5384
02:17:32.291 --> 02:17:35.560
<v Speaker 2>won't have the injuries and you won't have the problems but aren't you like the</v>

5385
02:17:35.561 --> 02:17:36.720
<v Speaker 2>whole idea about working out,</v>

5386
02:17:36.730 --> 02:17:38.410
<v Speaker 2>he's supposed to give your body time to recover.</v>

5387
02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Well they use it like a battle,</v>

5388
02:17:40.061 --> 02:17:42.280
<v Speaker 2>a seesaw if you like.</v>

5389
02:17:42.281 --> 02:17:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm a three day on,</v>

5390
02:17:43.181 --> 02:17:43.991
<v Speaker 2>one day off guy,</v>

5391
02:17:43.991 --> 02:17:44.651
<v Speaker 2>three days on,</v>

5392
02:17:44.651 --> 02:17:46.690
<v Speaker 2>one day off three which is what they prescribed.</v>

5393
02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:49.690
<v Speaker 2>But you look at the guys who are now the competitive level,</v>

5394
02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:53.260
<v Speaker 2>the guys that are competing on that are the top crossfitters in the world.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Usually every day.</v>

5442
02:19:32.090 --> 02:19:35.660
<v Speaker 8>I wake up at three o'clock in the morning and I run anywhere from 10 to 15 miles</v>

5443
02:19:35.661 --> 02:19:39.320
<v Speaker 8>in the morning and then I live about 25 miles from work.</v>

5444
02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:40.480
<v Speaker 8>So I,</v>

5445
02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:41.540
<v Speaker 8>I get my bicycle,</v>

5446
02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:42.680
<v Speaker 8>commute into work,</v>

02:19:50.151 --> 02:19:50.730
<v Speaker 8>eight miles,</v>

5450
02:19:50.730 --> 02:19:51.530

5451
02:19:51.530 --> 02:19:56.530
<v Speaker 8>Come back work and around five 30 I arrived back home 25 miles on my bike.</v>

5452
02:19:57.620 --> 02:19:58.640
<v Speaker 8>If I'm feeling good,</v>

5453
02:19:58.670 --> 02:20:00.070
<v Speaker 8>I've considered doing one in the house,</v>

5454
02:20:00.210 --> 02:20:03.980
<v Speaker 8>get off the bike and do like a short three or four or five mile run.</v>

5455
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:06.710
<v Speaker 8>That's my everyday life.</v>

5456
02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:09.140
<v Speaker 8>So I don't this train like an hour or so.</v>

5457
02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:13.130
<v Speaker 8>I tried it until something is uncomfortable and then national,</v>

5458
02:20:13.131 --> 02:20:13.970
<v Speaker 8>you know who you are,</v>

5459
02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:16.790
<v Speaker 8>she's fucking Christ.</v>

5460
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:19.290
<v Speaker 8>There's a thing called crossfit and</v>

5461
02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:21.920
<v Speaker 8>it just never ends.</v>

5462
02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:22.581
<v Speaker 8>This for me.</v>

5463
02:20:22.581 --> 02:20:27.581
<v Speaker 8>I've done some races where you're on a one mile track and you around for 48</v>

5464
02:20:27.951 --> 02:20:28.784
<v Speaker 8>hours straight.</v>

5465
02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:30.170
<v Speaker 8>So imagine reminder,</v>

5466
02:20:30.171 --> 02:20:32.030
<v Speaker 8>48 hours of running my mile track.</v>

5467
02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:33.850
<v Speaker 8>It's not like you're sleeping.</v>

5468
02:20:33.860 --> 02:20:34.091
<v Speaker 8>You're,</v>

5469
02:20:34.091 --> 02:20:35.800
<v Speaker 8>you're running for 48 hours,</v>

5470
02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:36.860
<v Speaker 8>70 miles you can get,</v>

5471
02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:39.570
<v Speaker 8>I want to talk about mine torture.</v>

5472
02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:43.820
<v Speaker 8>I think it's so fast.</v>

5473
02:20:43.970 --> 02:20:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Any of those dudes that are constantly trying to explore the limits of what you</v>

5474
02:20:47.831 --> 02:20:48.664
<v Speaker 2>can pull off.</v>

5475
02:20:49.300 --> 02:20:50.530
<v Speaker 2>We were just talking about this yesterday.</v>

5476
02:20:50.531 --> 02:20:54.400
<v Speaker 2>We had Andy Petranek on who owns crossfit La on our show and he was talking</v>

5477
02:20:54.401 --> 02:20:56.620
<v Speaker 2>about where it's come from and what it goes.</v>

5478
02:20:56.860 --> 02:20:58.360
<v Speaker 2>It used to be the guys,</v>

5479
02:20:58.750 --> 02:20:59.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5480
02:20:59.170 --> 02:21:03.220
<v Speaker 2>they used to give awards for if you could do like 40 pull ups like that was,</v>

5481
02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:08.520
<v Speaker 2>there's guys that blow out 107 in a row now like I can do for your straight arm.</v>

5482
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:12.820
<v Speaker 2>No we do a kipping pull up but I can do 40 in a row like w without even</v>

5483
02:21:12.821 --> 02:21:13.151
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

5484
02:21:13.151 --> 02:21:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Can you really simple?</v>

5485
02:21:14.620 --> 02:21:15.341
<v Speaker 2>Do you grab it,</v>

5486
02:21:15.341 --> 02:21:17.530
<v Speaker 2>a palms outward or pumps towards you?</v>

5487
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:21.730
<v Speaker 2>I go palms outward and it's just like when we jumped rope you jumped two at a</v>

5488
02:21:21.731 --> 02:21:22.121
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

5489
02:21:22.121 --> 02:21:22.571
<v Speaker 2>Always a,</v>

5490
02:21:22.571 --> 02:21:27.571
<v Speaker 2>now it's advancing to three at a time and like three swings under your feet each</v>

5491
02:21:27.641 --> 02:21:29.770
<v Speaker 2>jump and it's just,</v>

5492
02:21:29.771 --> 02:21:33.970
<v Speaker 2>you're learning that like man just evolves and gets better and better and adapts</v>

5493
02:21:33.971 --> 02:21:35.920
<v Speaker 2>that things like we have a workout called,</v>

5494
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:38.770
<v Speaker 2>we have a workout called Murph where you run a mile,</v>

5495
02:21:39.010 --> 02:21:40.180
<v Speaker 2>then you do 100 pull ups,</v>

5496
02:21:40.181 --> 02:21:41.440
<v Speaker 2>then you do 200 pushups,</v>

5497
02:21:41.441 --> 02:21:43.210
<v Speaker 2>300 air squats,</v>

5498
02:21:43.450 --> 02:21:46.900
<v Speaker 2>and then you run 300 air squats and then you run,</v>

5499
02:21:47.050 --> 02:21:48.280
<v Speaker 2>you can break it up in any order.</v>

5500
02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:50.260
<v Speaker 2>So like we do like five 10 15 five,</v>

5501
02:21:50.261 --> 02:21:50.900
<v Speaker 2>10 new,</v>

5502
02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:52.210
<v Speaker 2>you talking about Hindus squats,</v>

5503
02:21:52.211 --> 02:21:53.710
<v Speaker 2>we'd go all the way down to your heels.</v>

5504
02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5505
02:21:53.980 --> 02:21:56.590
<v Speaker 2>you're the crease of your hip has to break the crease of your knee.</v>

5506
02:21:56.620 --> 02:21:57.510
<v Speaker 2>So your hip has to go,</v>

5507
02:21:57.511 --> 02:21:58.060
<v Speaker 2>but you're not.</v>

5508
02:21:58.060 --> 02:21:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Your acid is not touch your heels,</v>

5509
02:21:59.750 --> 02:22:00.070
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

5510
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.490
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

5511
02:22:00.490 --> 02:22:00.940
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

5512
02:22:00.940 --> 02:22:01.601
<v Speaker 2>your hips.</v>

5513
02:22:01.601 --> 02:22:03.400
<v Speaker 2>They'll have to go below your knee crease.</v>

5514
02:22:03.940 --> 02:22:06.880
<v Speaker 2>And it's not quite as hard as Hindu squats,</v>

5515
02:22:06.881 --> 02:22:10.630
<v Speaker 2>but I can't imagine that you can do all that and do 300 so you run a mile,</v>

5516
02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:12.130
<v Speaker 2>then you do a hundred pull ups.</v>

5517
02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:12.993
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

5518
02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:14.650
<v Speaker 2>200 pushups,</v>

5519
02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:15.640
<v Speaker 2>which we do chest,</v>

5520
02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:16.900
<v Speaker 2>a hand release,</v>

5521
02:22:16.901 --> 02:22:17.590
<v Speaker 2>pushups.</v>

5522
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:18.880
<v Speaker 2>So your chest touches the ground,</v>

5523
02:22:18.910 --> 02:22:22.060
<v Speaker 2>you release your hands and then go up and you're thinking that's easier.</v>

5524
02:22:22.090 --> 02:22:22.271
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5525
02:22:22.271 --> 02:22:23.320
<v Speaker 2>it's harder to trust me.</v>

5526
02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Your chest is touching the ground on every pushup.</v>

5527
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:27.780
<v Speaker 2>And then you do 300 air squats.</v>

5528
02:22:27.780 --> 02:22:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Then you run a mile.</v>

5529
02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:29.610
<v Speaker 2>That's called Murph.</v>

5530
02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:30.743
<v Speaker 2>That's a workout.</v>

5531
02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Now add to it now a 20 pound weight vest.</v>

5532
02:22:35.310 --> 02:22:35.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5533
02:22:35.940 --> 02:22:37.710
<v Speaker 2>but without a 20 pound weight vest.</v>

5534
02:22:37.711 --> 02:22:42.711
<v Speaker 2>A guy in our gym did it in like 24 minutes and he did it like it takes me like</v>

5535
02:22:43.081 --> 02:22:44.790
<v Speaker 2>36 minutes or something to do it.</v>

5536
02:22:45.090 --> 02:22:47.700
<v Speaker 2>He didn't like 24 minutes and he did it.</v>

5537
02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5538
02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:52.380
<v Speaker 2>he was doing his miles in like five 15 or five 20,</v>

5539
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:54.000
<v Speaker 2>like a mile.</v>

5540
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:56.190
<v Speaker 2>He would run in five and then go do all that.</v>

5541
02:22:56.480 --> 02:22:58.500
<v Speaker 2>No he didn't do that one with the 20 pound vest.</v>

5542
02:22:58.810 --> 02:23:02.010
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] it goes substantially higher with the vest on,</v>

5543
02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:05.910
<v Speaker 2>but the times are just coming down and down and down.</v>

5544
02:23:05.911 --> 02:23:06.171
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

5545
02:23:06.171 --> 02:23:08.050
<v Speaker 2>the pull ups and the Po and the weight,</v>

5546
02:23:08.220 --> 02:23:09.840
<v Speaker 2>the injuries are people getting more,</v>

5547
02:23:10.260 --> 02:23:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I think people do sustain injuries just like they wouldn't MMA and everything</v>

5548
02:23:14.191 --> 02:23:14.460
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

5549
02:23:14.460 --> 02:23:15.730
<v Speaker 2>And we have a big problem with that.</v>

5550
02:23:15.860 --> 02:23:16.693
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

5551
02:23:16.930 --> 02:23:17.880
<v Speaker 2>and I think it was the NFL,</v>

5552
02:23:17.881 --> 02:23:19.260
<v Speaker 2>we talk about that on my show a lot.</v>

5553
02:23:19.261 --> 02:23:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Cause like my,</v>

5554
02:23:20.010 --> 02:23:24.900
<v Speaker 2>my girlfriend's dad's an ex NFL football player and he's got two artificial</v>

5555
02:23:24.901 --> 02:23:25.734
<v Speaker 2>hips,</v>

5556
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:29.130
<v Speaker 2>two knee surgeries and two shoulder surgeries there.</v>

5557
02:23:29.131 --> 02:23:31.380
<v Speaker 2>They become like bionic men cause dome.</v>

5558
02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:33.361
<v Speaker 2>He's pretty good.</v>

5559
02:23:33.361 --> 02:23:34.650
<v Speaker 2>He's a very successful businessman.</v>

5560
02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:35.310
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

5561
02:23:35.310 --> 02:23:38.850
<v Speaker 2>like I got a buddy who's a crossfitter who's a super bowl fucking,</v>

5562
02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:39.960
<v Speaker 2>he's a crossfitter now,</v>

5563
02:23:39.961 --> 02:23:41.130
<v Speaker 2>but he was in the Superbowl,</v>

5564
02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:42.660
<v Speaker 2>this guy's won the super bowl,</v>

5565
02:23:42.661 --> 02:23:46.470
<v Speaker 2>he's won national championship in football and Nash and the High School</v>

5566
02:23:46.470 --> 02:23:47.303
<v Speaker 2>Championship and football.</v>

5567
02:23:47.460 --> 02:23:48.630
<v Speaker 2>And he is a,</v>

5568
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:49.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5569
02:23:49.081 --> 02:23:53.910
<v Speaker 2>he's got all these injuries from football but like he'll tell you that crossfits</v>

5570
02:23:53.911 --> 02:23:57.630
<v Speaker 2>like keeping them in the game because like there's nothing better for your back</v>

5571
02:23:57.631 --> 02:23:59.490
<v Speaker 2>they say then doing deep back squats.</v>

5572
02:23:59.620 --> 02:24:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

5573
02:24:00.150 --> 02:24:00.421
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5574
02:24:00.421 --> 02:24:00.801
<v Speaker 2>like it,</v>

5575
02:24:00.801 --> 02:24:01.020
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

5576
02:24:01.020 --> 02:24:02.910
<v Speaker 2>that's fundamentally what's good for your spine.</v>

5577
02:24:02.911 --> 02:24:04.500
<v Speaker 2>Now if you're doing it with improper form,</v>

5578
02:24:04.770 --> 02:24:05.880
<v Speaker 2>you're going to fuck yourself up.</v>

5579
02:24:05.881 --> 02:24:06.360
<v Speaker 2>You're going to find,</v>

5580
02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:07.290
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go deep.</v>

5581
02:24:07.630 --> 02:24:09.600
<v Speaker 2>And when you do a deep squat,</v>

5582
02:24:09.601 --> 02:24:10.151
<v Speaker 2>like how,</v>

5583
02:24:10.151 --> 02:24:11.630
<v Speaker 2>how far down is your asco?</v>

5584
02:24:11.860 --> 02:24:12.490

<v Speaker 2>same kind of thing where I'm going to,</v>

5587
02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:17.790

5588
02:24:17.791 --> 02:24:18.990
<v Speaker 2>explosiveness at the top.</v>

5589
02:24:18.991 --> 02:24:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Like people don't understand,</v>

5590
02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:20.460
<v Speaker 2>they think,</v>

5591
02:24:20.460 --> 02:24:20.581

5593
02:24:21.511 --> 02:24:21.960
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

5594
02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:25.200
<v Speaker 2>I want to get as low down as I can because right there is where your,</v>

02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:31.360
<v Speaker 4>You should really,</v>

5688
02:26:31.361 --> 02:26:32.680
<v Speaker 4>so I chased this dude,</v>

5689
02:26:32.710 --> 02:26:33.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm like fuck,</v>

5690
02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:33.970

5691
02:26:33.970 --> 02:26:35.590
<v Speaker 4>and when I turned the corner,</v>

5692
02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:36.700
<v Speaker 4>he had just disappeared.</v>

5693
02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:40.210
<v Speaker 4>Thank God cause I live in Venice and my buddy's like,</v>

5694
02:26:40.211 --> 02:26:40.391

5695
02:26:40.391 --> 02:26:41.320
<v Speaker 4>he's a shoreline crip.</v>

5696
02:26:41.350 --> 02:26:43.960
<v Speaker 4>He would've come back that night and put a bullet in your head.</v>

5697
02:26:43.961 --> 02:26:44.920
<v Speaker 4>You're an idiot.</v>

5698
02:26:46.490 --> 02:26:47.260
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5699
02:26:47.260 --> 02:26:48.490
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

5700
02:26:48.850 --> 02:26:49.631
<v Speaker 4>in retrospect,</v>

5701
02:26:49.631 --> 02:26:49.840
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

5702
02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:50.650
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>

5703
02:26:50.650 --> 02:26:54.310
<v Speaker 4>I tell John Mayer about this is you got to read the book gift of fear.</v>

5704
02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:55.331
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

5705
02:26:55.331 --> 02:26:56.170
<v Speaker 4>read that book.</v>

5706
02:26:56.320 --> 02:26:56.950
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

5707
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:58.270
<v Speaker 4>and then go take Krav Maga.</v>

5708
02:26:58.630 --> 02:27:01.570
<v Speaker 4>So I tell Collin I'm going to crawl in the and Callen cause no,</v>

5709
02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:02.733
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5710
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:03.783
<v Speaker 4>not you.</v>

5711
02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:07.810
<v Speaker 4>You will bring it on yourself.</v>

5712
02:27:07.811 --> 02:27:08.141
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

5713
02:27:08.141 --> 02:27:09.310
<v Speaker 4>if you know how to use it,</v>

5714
02:27:09.311 --> 02:27:10.360
<v Speaker 4>it's like having a gun in your house.</v>

5715
02:27:10.390 --> 02:27:10.631
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5716
02:27:10.631 --> 02:27:11.200
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

5717
02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:12.033
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

5718
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:13.540
<v Speaker 4>So I don't have a gun.</v>

5719
02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:14.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't have fucking anything.</v>

5720
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:16.660
<v Speaker 4>That's good to tell people on the Internet.</v>

5721
02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:18.471
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what.</v>

5722
02:27:18.471 --> 02:27:19.091
<v Speaker 4>I got guns.</v>

5723
02:27:19.091 --> 02:27:19.751
<v Speaker 4>You'd come to my house.</v>

5724
02:27:19.751 --> 02:27:22.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna choke the fuck out of you if I got a hold of you.</v>

5725
02:27:23.810 --> 02:27:24.131
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

5726
02:27:24.131 --> 02:27:25.120
<v Speaker 4>I disagree with count.</v>

5727
02:27:25.170 --> 02:27:25.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5728
02:27:25.770 --> 02:27:26.550
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

5729
02:27:26.550 --> 02:27:29.070
<v Speaker 5>if anybody had a lack of self control as a young man,</v>

5730
02:27:29.071 --> 02:27:29.551
<v Speaker 5>it was me.</v>

5731
02:27:29.551 --> 02:27:32.070
<v Speaker 5>And it's one of the reasons my parents didn't actually want me doing martial</v>

5732
02:27:32.071 --> 02:27:34.230
<v Speaker 5>arts cause they were worried that I was going to start using it on people.</v>

5733
02:27:34.260 --> 02:27:36.050
<v Speaker 5>That was the number one fear in our house.</v>

5734
02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:37.530
<v Speaker 5>I had to convince them they wouldn't do that,</v>

5735
02:27:37.860 --> 02:27:39.210
<v Speaker 5>but you wouldn't do that.</v>

5736
02:27:39.211 --> 02:27:40.220
<v Speaker 5>You'd get self disciplined,</v>

5737
02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:41.430
<v Speaker 5>but it allows you,</v>

5738
02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:42.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5739
02:27:42.250 --> 02:27:44.400
<v Speaker 5>at least if that guy jumped on you,</v>

5740
02:27:44.420 --> 02:27:46.680
<v Speaker 5>attacked you or it didn't have a knife or something,</v>

5741
02:27:46.710 --> 02:27:46.901
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5742
02:27:46.901 --> 02:27:47.521
<v Speaker 5>where was a weapon?</v>

5743
02:27:47.521 --> 02:27:47.851
<v Speaker 5>You're in trouble.</v>

5744
02:27:47.851 --> 02:27:49.740
<v Speaker 5>At least you could kind of defend yourself.</v>

5745
02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:50.481
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5746
02:27:50.481 --> 02:27:50.741
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

5747
02:27:50.741 --> 02:27:54.600
<v Speaker 5>you put yourself in a better position and it's a great way to exercise a great</v>

5748
02:27:54.601 --> 02:27:55.381
<v Speaker 5>way to blow off steam.</v>

5749
02:27:55.381 --> 02:27:56.131
<v Speaker 5>And it's interesting,</v>

5750
02:27:56.131 --> 02:27:57.450
<v Speaker 5>you're actually learning something.</v>

5751
02:27:57.451 --> 02:27:58.800
<v Speaker 5>You're learning a language.</v>

5752
02:27:58.801 --> 02:27:59.790
<v Speaker 5>The language of how to,</v>

5753
02:27:59.970 --> 02:28:00.940
<v Speaker 5>how to strangle people.</v>

5754
02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:02.460
<v Speaker 5>How do we had a break arms?</v>

5755
02:28:02.461 --> 02:28:04.750
<v Speaker 5>How does he know how to get to positions and you,</v>

5756
02:28:04.751 --> 02:28:06.150
<v Speaker 5>you learn these moves.</v>

5757
02:28:06.151 --> 02:28:09.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean the interaction between two human beings and they're grappling.</v>

5758
02:28:09.511 --> 02:28:13.080
<v Speaker 5>There's an infinite number of positions and moves in different places to go to.</v>

5759
02:28:13.081 --> 02:28:13.660
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>

5760
02:28:13.660 --> 02:28:14.880
<v Speaker 5>it's a very intellectual,</v>

5761
02:28:14.881 --> 02:28:19.560
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu is really completely under appreciated as an intellectual exercise.</v>

5762
02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:21.890
<v Speaker 4>I already threatened enough go.</v>

5763
02:28:21.891 --> 02:28:22.010
<v Speaker 4>He</v>

5764
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:22.611
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't do it,</v>

5765
02:28:22.611 --> 02:28:22.881
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5766
02:28:22.881 --> 02:28:24.320
<v Speaker 1>I never threatened people.</v>

5767
02:28:24.650 --> 02:28:25.341
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't do it.</v>

5768
02:28:25.341 --> 02:28:25.701
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing,</v>

5769
02:28:25.701 --> 02:28:27.200
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing martial arts my whole life.</v>

5770
02:28:27.201 --> 02:28:27.500
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

5771
02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I fucking have.</v>

5772
02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:30.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever said I'm going to kick your fucking ass to I do it.</v>

5773
02:28:30.850 --> 02:28:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I do it on stage once a year.</v>

5774
02:28:34.310 --> 02:28:35.210
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

5775
02:28:35.220 --> 02:28:36.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll never do that.</v>

5776
02:28:36.141 --> 02:28:38.740
<v Speaker 1>At least once a year somebody will push me like um,</v>

5777
02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:40.060
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying Harlan,</v>

5778
02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:45.070
<v Speaker 1>just like I laughed through everything but at a certain point I have a snap</v>

5779
02:28:45.411 --> 02:28:46.710
<v Speaker 1>where I'm just like so dumb.</v>

5780
02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:48.440
<v Speaker 1>That's going to get you hurt man.</v>

5781
02:28:48.470 --> 02:28:49.820
<v Speaker 1>You'd come to Jujitsu with me tonight.</v>

5785
02:28:52.970 --> 02:28:53.803
<v Speaker 1>That'd be silly.</v>

5786
02:28:54.460 --> 02:28:55.293
<v Speaker 1>Where do you go?</v>
