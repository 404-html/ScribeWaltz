I said it.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.500
Charlie Murphy's here,
bitches buckle up,
but hello

7
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.740
it fill a git until the music kicks in.

8
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.410
That was voiceless to Charlie Murphy and freeze love land rich.

9
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.760
Charlie doesn't fuck around.
He brings a whole fucking posy to your house,
Dude.

10
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:50.880
That's true.
I like it.
I bought the whole camp.
Freeze.

11
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:53.490
Love is my friend from the old days of the comedy store.

12
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:57.780
I've known freeze for fuck.
I like a decade now,
if not longer,

13
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.510
if not longer.
Probably about 15 years.
Been a long time man.

14
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.700
You've been having a lot of unions is weak.
I have.

15
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410
It's been a good what's going on?
I've been in New York,

16
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:09.350
I've been in New York for like eight,
nine years now.

17
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:14.030
So this is my first time back in New York and around back in Ela,
you know?

18
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.020
Yeah.
We go way out in Ontario,
you know,
out there.
But we're in Hollywood.

19
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.560
A lot of people like,
Gee,
I thought you were dead.

20
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.240
And so you guys have been doing a lot of touring,
right?
Oh yeah.
Man.

21
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.910
All over the country.
Outside of the country.
In fact,

22
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:31.910
we're getting ready to go back to Europe again in October.
Oh yeah.

23
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.600
And then I'm doing a show down at Guantanamo Bay.

24
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.490
That's going to be big.
That's probably when we'll film my next one hour special.

25
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.600
One time.
Obey,
Huh?
Yeah.
Charlie Murphy lab to tell Holy Shit.

26
00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:49.490
So it'd be 100% soldiers.
How did we send soldiers?
Yeah.
Whoa.
Go hard to real big.

27
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:54.230
Well,
they let you talk about whatever you want as far as we know.
Yeah,
man.

28
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.360
I mean,
I was like [inaudible] you know when I come down there I'm,

29
00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:59.920
I'm not pulling no punches.
They was like,
well,
no problem.
Well,
I,

30
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.920
there was a great story that Louis C K wrote on his blog about going to,

31
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.370
going overseas to entertain the troops and how,
you know,

32
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:10.880
enthusiastic the troops are and how good it felt and everything.
Boat.
Yeah.

33
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.180
I said he kept getting in trouble.
The Shit,
he just couldn't help himself.

34
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.490
Higher-Ups.
Yeah.
Cause they didn't,

35
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.360
they wanted him to be fairly clean and they would just go dirty because he knew

36
00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:22.910
that's what they wanted to hear and then fucking trust.
Right.
Crazy.

37
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.360
And after the show,
if the general shows up and he had a problem,
I'm like,

38
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.830
well I'm not in the army so fuck you.
Keep it moving.

39
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:34.280
Some scary people you deal with.
Even though we're both veterans,
man,

40
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.570
this ray man,
you had your chance to get over.
I'm not doing pushups for you.

41
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:41.020
Then instead I'm gonna come and do my show and whoever don't lag.

42
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.930
You guys were both with military.
Yeah,
man.
Yeah.
I was in the navy.

43
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:47.570
He was in the army does,
this is a different breed man.

44
00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:50.570
People have been in the military.
You,
your eyes are more open.

45
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.440
People have been in the military are like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
this is for real.

46
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.030
Oh Shit,
this shit's for keeps everybody out there running around playing doctor,

47
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.900
you know,
want to know how the world really works.

48
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:05.350
Even like when they show him the news and they show like a live footage of a

49
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:09.820
firefight on the news.
If you was never in the military,

50
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:12.430
he was never around a real five,
five frank.

51
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.960
That's not the same thing as being there.
You know,
like what you see on the news.

52
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.130
It has an effect on you definitely.
But being there when it's going on,

53
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:22.090
it has a different effect.

54
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.660
100% of people get desensitized seeing shit.

55
00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:30.790
Exactly.
You ain't gonna be set aside and he's standing there.
Yeah.

56
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.150
And bullets are flying by and realize this could be it right now.

57
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:37.110
This could be at any moment.
That's true.
Yeah.

58
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.110
Just a different breed bound people have been involved in the military are

59
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:45.880
completely different breed that.
So it's a hard way to live,
man.

60
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.920
And for a lot of people,
you know,

61
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.990
this is not a lot of fucking options in this country.

62
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.620
You know a lot of do to jump in.
I'm gonna tell you something man,

63
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.000
if you ain't,
if you ain't got nothing going on,
it's not a bad choice.

64
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.750
Point blank.
If you ain't really doing nothing.
If you,

65
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.980
if you're sitting back going,
well that's a hard life.

66
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:06.700
I don't want to do that and you're not doing anything.

67
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.590
You need to do that.
It's better than doing nothing.
Yeah,

68
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.430
it's a that's why I went Joe,
cause I would have ended up doing nothing.

69
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.970
I was just sitting at the house getting in trouble,
you know?
Yeah.

70
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.140
Nothing was going to work it out.

71
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.220
So it was like yo go to the military and I got it together.
So if you,

72
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.260
if you're not doing nothing then that's where you need to go.
Well No,

73
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.630
men definitely need some form of discipline.
We definitely,

74
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.840
we need some form of discipline.

75
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.650
We need something to shock us out of our complacency and kept us moving and we

76
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:42.300
need something.
That's true.
Camp should be mandatory for every man.

77
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.550
Once you turn 18 whether you go to the middle of champion,

78
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.870
that I think your boot camp experience,

79
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.090
you know you should go somewhere and you know,
cause you're going to learn,

80
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.980
take something home with that.

81
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.500
<v 2>No,
you're good.</v>

82
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.530
You get in a situation where people that do not love you have complete control

83
00:05:00.081 --> 00:05:04.880
over your life.
That's a good,
that's a good understanding of life.
Right?
You know,

84
00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:08.210
these are people,
they don't,
they don't care about your feelings,
they don't care.

85
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.720
It doesn't matter.
And you're going to do what they say dude.
And if you don't,

86
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.260
the repercussions,
there are a lot like life.

87
00:05:15.261 --> 00:05:19.900
You know you right and you're going to be in a bad situation.
So on the alarm you

88
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.260
<v 0>come out strong,
you know,</v>

89
00:05:21.261 --> 00:05:24.310
like you don't trip out of other stuff like other people.

90
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.180
It's just fascinating that we like to pretend that our society is any more

91
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:32.160
evolved than the Romans or than the Greeks.
You know?

92
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.350
And then you really feel like,
you know what the military really is.
You know,

93
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:37.330
it's just design.
Our hired army,

94
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.910
the people we pay to go fuck people up and just keep it,

95
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.390
keep it smooth over here,
keep it smoothed over here.
Everything over there.

96
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.320
It's tear it up,
tear it up.
Crazy.
That's a,

97
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.690
that's not always be the situation on the planet.

98
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.310
You got as long as you got people in different countries and all that stuff

99
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.190
going to have compensation

100
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.820
<v 3>for resources and you got to have own.
I know,
but we don't,</v>

101
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.120
we don't have any idea what it must feel like to be invaded.

102
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.610
That's gotta be some trippy Shit.

103
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.790
Could you imagine if you were living in Afghanistan for say,

104
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.560
you know Afghanistan is a fairly rural place.
It's a very strange country.

105
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.880
There's only one real city cobbles the real city.
Everything else has all these,

106
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.280
these territories run by warlords.

107
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:27.281
It's very strange and fall of a sudden tanks show up giant metal tanks and

108
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:30.320
fucking jets flying overhead and you're like,

109
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:35.030
what the fuck you just out there where your goats and your Betches trying to

110
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:37.830
keep everything down.
Yeah.

111
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.850
There would be an all of a sudden ism American troops are tanks and guns even

112
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.660
more scary to imagine it happening here,
period.
Oh yeah.

113
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.200
My House of course

114
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.980
<v 4>identify with the fear would happen at my house.</v>

115
00:06:50.981 --> 00:06:55.210
But if I looked at her mom black,
nothing tanks coming up the block and all that,

116
00:06:55.211 --> 00:06:56.280
that that would be,

117
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.980
<v 3>well,
we like to pretend that we're the peak of civilization.
Right.</v>

118
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.960
But we're doing that to somebody else.
The peak,
you know,
they're easily could be,

119
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.080
uh,
an advanced race above,
you know,

120
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.480
or a advanced country rather a above this one.

121
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.990
There could be some new military power that all of a sudden starts taking over

122
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.450
and we could be in the same situation that,
you know,

123
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:18.580
other countries are as opposed to us.
Oh yeah.

124
00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:22.630
They could have definitely something.
Anything,
I mean,
things switch over time.

125
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.750
It might not be something instantaneous,
but an a,

126
00:07:25.751 --> 00:07:29.380
an a few months or a few years time.
It could get all fucked up.

127
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.190
<v 2>It could.
I'm going to tell you like my service,
I was in Berlin and uh,</v>

128
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.590
this was like in 1985,

129
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.750
86 this was all before the wall had come down.
And Berlin,

130
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.150
we were literally stationed in the heart of Berlin and Berlin is,

131
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.050
is like Manhattan of Europe.

132
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.640
So we would have tanks rolling down city streets,
right.

133
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:57.020
Past city buses.
And it was,
it felt weird.

134
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.570
It felt weird.
But how did the people respond to them or desensitize?

135
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.040
That's been that way since the,
you know,

136
00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:08.390
since they put the wall up and 61 or 62 whenever it was.

137
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.590
So they were used to it.
But even for me,
I never got used to that.

138
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:14.240
I was always weird.
Wow,

139
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:14.980
<v 4>that's good.</v>

140
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.140
That's one of the things about going at one time when they had that wall there

141
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:20.950
too,
you know,
when I,
when I was in the navy,
went to get more.

142
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.580
So when I go back to perform that,
and it was my first time there,

143
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.190
but they have that wall there with the soldiers on the wall and they paint.

144
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.990
It tells you if you approach that gate or if you tried to go through it,

145
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.520
did they shoot to kill

146
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.140
<v 3>you do both sides.
Both sides of it.</v>

147
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.790
If you tried to come to us,
they shoot him and kill him.

148
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:43.220
You tried to go get insecure.
They shooting the kid.
Isn't it fucked up that,

149
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.450
that's cool that we allow that.
Like there's,
there's some uh,

150
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.300
area 51 spot where if he crossed the line,

151
00:08:49.301 --> 00:08:52.650
there's a certain line where you get too close to area 51 they're just allowed

152
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.950
to shoot you.
It like,
yeah.
It's like you cross this line.

153
00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.140
We've seen nothing like what the fuck,
what kind of ridiculous rule is that?

154
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.220
That's,

155
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.660
that's so ridiculous that the people that are in charge of the government would

156
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:07.920
allow something like that.

157
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.670
You can just shoot someone who's driving and you don't have to explain shit,

158
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.350
you know,
security.
You might,
they think about it.
What's,
what's behind,

159
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:20.130
what's all in there and area 51 you might be like,
if you knew what it was,

160
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:23.370
he would be like,
listen,
they got to shoot anyone that comes in here.

161
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.140
And I've always wondered,

162
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.030
I always wondered whether or not it's really alien shit or whether it's just

163
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.900
secret government projects.
You know,
everybody claims Alien Shit,

164
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:37.680
but if you don't know what the fuck they're capable of and you think it's one

165
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:41.040
thing,
but it really is far more advanced,
you'd probably think it was alien.

166
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.440
And then the,
the rumors get spread.
And,

167
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.250
and if you're some scientists that's thinks he's a bad motherfucker,

168
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.270
but meanwhile do some Russians at figured out some shit that nobody else has and

169
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:54.240
we've got their information and it's in a hangar somewhere in the desert,

170
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.120
you know,
you,
you stumble upon that,
you would probably think that's alien.

171
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.640
You'd probably think,
where's this coming from?
Oh my God,

172
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.250
<v 4>you made it fully,
fully realized human being.</v>

173
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.880
You'd think he's an alien because most people in that,
you know what I'm saying?

174
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:10.010
We don't use,
we don't use our home brain bro.
We don't know.

175
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.400
We the only the only species on the planet.
No,
we only use 10% of our brains.

176
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.290
The brain capacity.
We only use 10% of ash.
Why?
Why?

177
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.920
How come elephants using,
I heard even send them it bears and their elephants.

178
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:28.170
They can't drive cars,
but we use 10% of ours and we do all this technical stuff.

179
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.490
I think that's an urban myth that I'm saying 10% I've seen it.

180
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.330
I was pretty debunked.
You started the buck.

181
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.310
It's looking it up right now he's looking at which is check cause I want to
know,

182
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.120
I've heard that before.
Now 10% of our brain we don't use,

183
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.080
we don't use our tag capacity.
Don't

184
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.570
why not?
You know what I'm saying?
Or is it could be in control.

185
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.600
<v 3>Yeah.
It's a black anything it's been,
yeah,
it's a method.
Yeah.
We,
we,</v>

186
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.210
we talked about this in the podcast once before because I had heard someone else

187
00:11:02.211 --> 00:11:04.350
say it too.
Um,
it's,

188
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.630
I misquote misquote of Albert Einstein or the misinterpretation of the work of

189
00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:10.520
Pierre for Florence

190
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:16.450
<v 4>Murphy Dismiss quoted and Stan and Pierre who Florin Florin.</v>

191
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.820
It's one of those things everybody says you waited from Roosevelt Junior,

192
00:11:19.821 --> 00:11:22.400
senior high school.
So that's the ending.

193
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.530
<v 3>Newton south class of 85.</v>

194
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.920
No.
I think a lot of people think that people,
people say this all,

195
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.610
we use 100% of my brain.
I don't think they understand it that way.
I think that,

196
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:39.500
I think we know what areas of the mind are stimulated during certain activities.

197
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.790
We can monitor the mine,
but there's a lot of the,
what is the consciousness?

198
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:44.900
Where's the consciousness store?

199
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.460
<v 4>Where's the sagging portability?
Right.</v>

200
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.220
Person is special that they just tapped into something that we all have,

201
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.740
<v 5>but we don't all use it.
You know what I'm saying?</v>

202
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.430
I think most psychics are full of shit.
Most of them.
Not all of them.
No.

203
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.640
I'll leave room cause that's what I'm saying.

204
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:07.510
When you see somebody like Michael Jordan,
the way he took away,
took basketball,

205
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.970
he was the psychic.
No,
I'm saying he tapped into something.

206
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.490
He tapped into something that nobody else tapped into as far as playing the

207
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:18.250
games,
his turn.
Yet he took him to the highest level.
Yeah.

208
00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.040
He took it to the highest level.
That means nobody else can do that.

209
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:24.820
But him or just that nobody else tapped in to what you know.
Well,

210
00:12:24.821 --> 00:12:29.080
there was also frankly,
as you know,
you know this freaks like you know,

211
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.280
like just like John Holmes had a big giant deck that's abnormal abnormal deck

212
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.700
and your world in my world.
Yeah.

213
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.990
<v 6>Who's steals a better example?
He's a black guy with a giant Dick.</v>

214
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.530
Okay,
that's a,
that's unusual

215
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:46.980
<v 5>Oregon.</v>

216
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.060
Who's to say that there is aren't brain's capable of being hyper powered like

217
00:12:51.061 --> 00:12:55.750
that?
Some guys got to fucking 20 inch Dick Brain,
you know,
and that's what it is.

218
00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:01.510
Three twenties dig brain that he's fully fully realized to us.

219
00:13:01.651 --> 00:13:05.910
He was seem like an alien.
Like this guy's so smart.
Right.
They hadn't won a news.

220
00:13:05.911 --> 00:13:10.410
He was doing all this different mathematical solutions at one time and he was,

221
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.040
he was talking like 15 people and he was telling them when it were,

222
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.330
the day they were born through asking them math questions,

223
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.450
the day that their children were born,
he was telling,

224
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.830
answering questions about their life with Matt and he had,
yeah,

225
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.990
he had a whole room full of people.
There's one guy in the world that does that,

226
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.090
but then they go,
then I have to go,

227
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.330
what is he tapping into that makes him or allows him to do that?
It's,

228
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.530
and it's all manipulation of mathematics.
Wow.

229
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.220
His grasp on understanding mathematics as he could.

230
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.060
He could do like a thousand joints,

231
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:50.190
the mathematical joints at one time and you go on one cause once to three times

232
00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:54.990
six Jesus,
while you're doing that and he's doing 1520 of them at the same time.

233
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:59.130
You ever see those dudes played chess where they played 10 games at a time and

234
00:13:59.131 --> 00:14:02.320
they'll walk,
you know,
it was a table

235
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.170
by one of those guys that fell hard.
Really horrible.
I feel like an idiot.

236
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.400
That's dude names.
When I was in the navy,
took amazing,

237
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:16.460
took the entire mess deck like 45 guys chess boards in front of us started at

238
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:18.810
the first guy that he walks to,
the last one.

239
00:14:18.811 --> 00:14:21.120
Then when he walked baked then maybe three laps,

240
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.420
which means he'd beat everybody in that room in three or four moves.
You know,
he,

241
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:30.360
he took everybody quick man,
but this guy couldn't tie his shoes though.

242
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.790
He had to wear loafers.
He never,
he never could master tiny shoes or blacks

243
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.940
really call it an idiot.

244
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.100
He was a weapons officer,
man.

245
00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:47.700
He was real smart with stuff like that when we came to common sense things,

246
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.920
glue them away.
Wow,
that's interesting.
Yeah.

247
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.480
<v 3>Life balances itself out in one way or another.
Somehow bounces.</v>

248
00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:01.180
You don't get to be super intelligent and be cool.
Right.

249
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.150
This guy that's got these real thick,

250
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:10.210
I mean super duper thick coke bottle glasses and what he does is he looks at it,

251
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:16.460
they took a picture of the New York skyline of three 60 picture of the New York

252
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:18.360
skyline and um,

253
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.800
they showed him the pictures and he's got the pitchers all up close to his,

254
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:25.490
to his eyes,
to these thick glasses.
And then he walked into,

255
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.960
he walks into a room and he paints with a pencil.

256
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.690
He draws the whole skyline.
Exactly to a tee from members.

257
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.520
That's a kid that can look out the window.
Are We?
Yeah.

258
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:38.690
We've talked about this kid before.

259
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:43.610
He can look out a window of a plane and see a city and then draw that exact

260
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:48.530
image.
Right.
It's incredible.
It's,
I'm saying they're using the same muscle.

261
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:52.280
We use the brain.
Yeah.
I think when you see something like that,
you got to say,

262
00:15:52.281 --> 00:15:56.360
okay,
well clearly there's levels of potential that haven't been tapped.

263
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.850
If we're evolving and we think we are right,

264
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.480
we think at one point in time where some lower primate and we evolve to become

265
00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:06.260
human,
we're,
we're not going to stay this.
We're going to get something else,

266
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.590
and when you see these servants,
you see these people with crazy abilities.

267
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.740
What that represents to me is potential.
This is,

268
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.430
this is a potential performance of the human body,
but what?

269
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.950
It's just not working in all of us yet,
but if this guy can do it,
yeah,
yeah.

270
00:16:18.951 --> 00:16:20.480
He shits himself and yeah.
Yeah.

271
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.110
He can't fucking watch TV without screaming and running into the walls,

272
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:28.490
but he can still take a picture with his mind and draw.
Right.
You can't do that.

273
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.170
If you could do that too and all the other stuff you do.
Wow.
Right?
Yes.

274
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:36.350
When we've evolved cause I mean if I had to take my choice,

275
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:40.370
I think I'd rather just not be able to draw on not shit my pants on myself.

276
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.470
I would say that too.
I would go with that too.
Yeah.
I don't want to be

277
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.930
extreme example that's crying all the time.
Some extreme example,

278
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.900
it can't get my shit together.
Listen to him play the violin,

279
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.270
just keep doing this cop.
He shut himself,

280
00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:57.830
only wants just keep doing these problems,

281
00:16:57.831 --> 00:17:01.490
becoming the best at something and anything and trying to become the best you

282
00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:04.040
are.
You risk becoming a fucking mad person.

283
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:08.480
You're a crazy person to get out there and to really get out there to hit the

284
00:17:08.481 --> 00:17:11.990
highest highs,
you almost have to just be fucking nuts.

285
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.850
You almost have to just let it all go.

286
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:18.200
You almost have to get you just willing to go to places that the other people

287
00:17:18.201 --> 00:17:22.430
won't go quicker than they're willing to go harder with more discipline further,

288
00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:24.650
further,
further.
And as you're doing that,
man,

289
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:28.640
that's a separate from the pack of you fed separate from humans.
Right.

290
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.150
He gets so wrapped up and trying to accomplish something and you become crazy.

291
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.580
You know,
I've seen it happen.
I've seen it,
I've seen it.

292
00:17:34.581 --> 00:17:37.970
I've seen people go crazy.
We've seen,
yeah,
he was,

293
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.590
he shot lasers at me the other day because the folks who don't know Robert

294
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.690
William and provider is a comedy store legend.

295
00:17:44.691 --> 00:17:48.530
He's a dude who used to hang around in the comedy store and he was always like

296
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:52.080
wearing like plastic bags and stuff.
He's kind of homeless and uh,

297
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.560
he would have all these one liners about weed.
He knew all this information,

298
00:17:55.561 --> 00:18:00.450
but we,
his whole act was about weed.
I mean like if she want to grow 35%,

299
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:04.140
then you need to have five clones,
but you have to catch them at the right month.

300
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:07.450
And
he bought a new suit recently.

301
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.830
Did I say things are on the up and ups with him?
All right,
I'm glad he's alive.

302
00:18:10.831 --> 00:18:14.310
Pharmaceuticals baby.
He was always very friendly.
I've never shaken his hand,

303
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.190
but we've always been very cordial and friendly to each other cause he don't,

304
00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:19.410
he won't touch,
people do want to touch people.

305
00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:22.980
And I tried to give him knuckles once.
I,
I prefer not to do that.
I prefer not to.

306
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.690
And a so he doesn't like being touched.
The poor guy and you know,

307
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:30.060
you can only speculate as to what the fuck that's all about.

308
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.650
Someone doesn't like being touched.

309
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:35.550
I mean who doesn't like a good hug every now and then?
Someone who got,
again,

310
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:40.290
this was a guy,
we want it to be a comedian so desperately.
I mean he

311
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.290
just put himself in the comedy world.
I don't,
I don't know if he was ever funny,

312
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.420
but he,
he made me laugh a few times.
Yeah,
there,
there,
there were silly,

313
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.270
he had some silly one liners that were funny and they,

314
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.080
he was molested by a fellow comic and that's what heavy did.

315
00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.620
Maybe we didn't give up the knuckles

316
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:04.030
<v 5>fat,
nasty.
Looking at fake big Dick Black Porn.</v>

317
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.820
Oh yeah,
like where it's like,
yeah,
this is a really,

318
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.850
they have the artificial dicks and they don't pull them out.

319
00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.660
They keep them in their pants and they just like pull out this fake Dick again.

320
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:18.050
That's my day.
It doesn't even look real at all,
man.
No,

321
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.920
they just do it.
This guy makes films,
he makes videos,

322
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.550
but it's a fake deck and you could buy it if you want to have a fake big black

323
00:19:24.551 --> 00:19:27.520
dick.
It's so ridiculous.
I mean,

324
00:19:27.521 --> 00:19:31.630
he doesn't do his special effects budget is very minimal because this dude

325
00:19:31.631 --> 00:19:35.140
doesn't even take his pants off.
He's just got this fake Dick Poking out of it.

326
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:35.731
The guy's name,

327
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:40.731
who was the Main Exhibit Hall Jab Time Boogie

328

Woogie Song called I brush their hair.

329
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.230
Oh my God.

330
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:54.340
We met this guy and he came to the show and he said he wanted to do 10 minutes,

331
00:19:54.341 --> 00:19:57.520
which I always let you know any communities that local would come and do some

332
00:19:57.521 --> 00:20:02.290
times she's never said that on the Internet.
What I said,
I said,

333
00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:05.710
I let them come better get busy because if you don't know what's going to
happen,

334
00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.270
so you,
that's beautiful.
You let anybody do 10 minutes anywhere.

335
00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.210
Everywhere I've been,
dude's come up to me said,
Yo man,
I'm struggling.

336
00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:16.390
I'm trying to get it cracking,
you know?
Wow.
And then you let them go.

337
00:20:16.391 --> 00:20:19.610
Up and do timeouts.
Charlie Murphy,
you're on time.

338
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.500
You're a fucking beautiful person sometimes to the audience is shit grin because

339
00:20:23.501 --> 00:20:27.460
you know sometimes it's terrible.
Wow.
This dude came up.
He had to,

340
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.810
he had to fake that going around his knee.
Okay.

341
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.470
Hopes to kill boss Dick wrapped around his knee.

342
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.670
Was that part of his act?
He was came up,

343
00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:43.780
he was prominently displaying is fake Dick and I was and I was sitting in the

344
00:20:43.781 --> 00:20:47.900
back going,
wow,
you know,
we can say,
well we want,
but that showed me this,

345
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.040
<v 4>that is so big that it's show business</v>

346
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.390
<v 5>he's on.
He's on a stage is a light on him and people looking at him,</v>

347
00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.980
he had everyone's attention.
Every

348
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.140
kid what you want to say about it,

349
00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.570
that Showbiz and therefore that could be you that could be used.

350
00:21:06.571 --> 00:21:07.750
So consider yourself,

351
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.760
consider yourself fortunate that you don't have to pull them fake big.

352
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:16.430
Stand in front of a crowd and get paid.
Harrison was songs about your chest.

353
00:21:16.431 --> 00:21:19.430
Hair.
Yeah.
You,
that's a hell of a way to make a living.

354
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.700
Being in the military is hard.
Shit.
That's hard.

355
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.550
<v 3>A hard time getting the guys offstage where they don't want to just do 10</v>

356
00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:26.510
minutes.
They want to keep going.

357
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.750
<v 5>That dude wanted to stay and he thought he was killing them.</v>

358
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:33.520
Everyone was looking at him like,
Yo,
what is this about?
Okay.
Jokes.

359
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.810
So
I think even a lighter,

360
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.730
<v 3>he was bugging man,
you took the craziest path into comedy ever,
man.</v>

361
00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:45.580
And I always admire you for doing that.

362
00:21:45.581 --> 00:21:50.570
When we met Charlie and I did this thing,
the maximum comedy tour,
Oh,

363
00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:55.410
it's Charli me and John or have fraud and we had a great fucking time.
Oh yeah.

364
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.220
And uh,
we got to become friends.
But I,

365
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:02.020
I was always impressed that you took,

366
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.920
you were an actor essentially when you went on Chappelle show,

367
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.940
you would just a guy who was really good at telling stories and a really good

368
00:22:09.941 --> 00:22:11.720
actor and the brother of a,

369
00:22:11.721 --> 00:22:15.580
the most famous standup comedian possibly of all time.
Right.

370
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.150
And you just jumped white into a headline in man.
Oh yeah.

371
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.440
That takes some crazy balls.

372
00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:26.530
I think about like when I first started doing standup,
if someone said,
okay,

373
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:30.040
now you're going to do 45 minutes,
I want to just shit all over myself.

374
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.110
You just went right in.

375
00:22:32.111 --> 00:22:35.230
You never had a moment where you were like Charlie Murphy,

376
00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:38.770
the Middle Act who toured the country and tried to do little gigs.

377
00:22:38.771 --> 00:22:42.160
Like you just went right into the fucking flame,

378
00:22:42.161 --> 00:22:45.270
which is really hard to do and said,
Eh,

379
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:49.810
<v 4>I'm going to have a freeze lovers.
Yeah.
And told me don't throw the whole bag.</v>

380
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.650
Do you?
And,
and,
and that's,
Yo,

381
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:58.400
we blend it too though is because of the age I was when I started doing standup,

382
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.080
I was like,
you don't get time for it.
You are already,
you know,
jump,

383
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:06.940
you don't have time to really opening for people and showing you don't have time

384
00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:08.940
for it.
You got to show up with something to say to you.

385
00:23:08.941 --> 00:23:11.770
You have something to say.
Okay,
we have something to say.
Let's go,

386
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.060
go iron it out and make it happen,
you know?
Yeah.
Not leaving it alone.
So you

387
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.230
<v 3>the philosophy by the time you ever got on stage.</v>

388
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.130
When I first got on stage I was 21 I was an idiot.
I didn't know shit.

389
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.220
I had no business telling anybody anything about anything.

390
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.370
So I'll just talk about pussy.
I'll just tell sex jokes.

391
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.050
I mean it was like my whole act

392
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.650
<v 4>because I wasn't the first time I got on stage home</v>

393
00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.920
and did a show and got paid for it.

394
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.120
I probably got paid wait when winning is not deserved.

395
00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.340
But once I tasted the money

396
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.823
<v 5>old was</v>

397
00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.040
<v 4>just telling me I can't go back up on that stage again.
You Dot.
Yeah man.</v>

398
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.100
I was like I'll do whatever I have to do to stay up there.

399
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.040
I was telling people no one is,
look man,
you don't understand.

400
00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:56.930
I'm going to beat you up for real.
You know what?

401
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.240
I'm really going to bust the makes them on your face.

402
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:02.630
You better let it go cause I'm not giving this job up,
you know?

403
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:06.020
And I stayed with it,
man.
How old were you when you first got on stage?

404
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:11.420
42 wow.
Wow.
What was that like?

405
00:24:11.421 --> 00:24:14.540
Man is what a giant like shift in your life.

406
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.350
Like all of the sudden Jim was here touring all over the fucking country,

407
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:22.390
personally perform on the first two years.
I didn't believe that,
uh,

408
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:27.050
that it was real.
It was like,
okay,
this is you.

409
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:30.950
They're being courteous to you because they liked you on pair of a show and,

410
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.520
and you know,
they're not booing you.
And then so go get this money and have fun,

411
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.470
but don't,
don't take it serious because at any moment it's going to disappear.

412
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.333
You know what I'm saying?

413
00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:44.180
But then that didn't happen and it became a responsibility,
like,
okay,

414
00:24:44.181 --> 00:24:46.430
this is not disappearing.
You have to,

415
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.710
it's your responsibility to take this as far as you can.
Wow.
That's a weird,

416
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.420
that's a weird way of thinking about it.

417
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.490
So why did you think that it was going to go away?

418
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.930
It was it because truth is too good to be true,
man.
Yeah.

419
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:02.640
It was too good to be true for me going into the room and soundstage,

420
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.310
but at this,
at that time,
you know,
1520 minutes and getting five grand,

421
00:25:07.311 --> 00:25:08.600
10 grams,
what?

422
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:13.370
We're talking too good to be my whatever I want to talk about.
Come on,
man.

423
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.370
It wasn't like some says you have to do liquid enacting.

424
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.120
We give you a script apart and we have to deliver this guy to the audience,

425
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:25.490
not you.
I was saying it was you,
so that was too good to be true.
I was like,

426
00:25:25.491 --> 00:25:29.450
what man?
Come on man.
What's the hardest part about starting not late?

427
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.920
Is it that you're already set in your ways and you got to shift your whole life

428
00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:36.810
around because now you're a stand up comic and know the hardest part of my

429
00:25:36.811 --> 00:25:37.644
standard starting up,

430
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.650
sorry out that late for me was that I had most of the comedians that were my

431
00:25:42.651 --> 00:25:46.880
age.
I'm 52 years old now.
Most of you look that fucking my age.

432
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.960
Crazy crowd.
A lot of fans their age,
you know what I'm saying?

433
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.910
I have fans my age,

434
00:25:52.911 --> 00:25:57.911
but have also a lot of fans that are 2118 and now because of the new show,

435
00:25:59.211 --> 00:26:03.470
I'm doing it with Terry crews.
Are we there yet?
Five or six years old again,
he's,

436
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:08.390
a lot of kids are popping up.
So when I started doing standup I was,
I was like,

437
00:26:08.391 --> 00:26:12.350
well,
who do you want to,
who are you talking to them?
You can't talk to everybody.

438
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.580
You can't talk to little kids.

439
00:26:13.581 --> 00:26:18.110
The same way he talks to adults and answer that came back was just be yourself

440
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.860
and the people who you're supposed to be talking to him on the show up.

441
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.090
Ones who you ain't supposed to be talking to will not come back.
You know?

442
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.300
And I've been doing pretty good with that and you know,
I just,
I just do me,

443
00:26:29.301 --> 00:26:29.620
I don't try.

444
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.470
That's why I've been able to go all around the world and haven't had no problem

445
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:38.450
because when we get there,
I'm not struggling with,
oh,
I'm in Stockholm now,

446
00:26:38.451 --> 00:26:41.960
so how am I going to know I'm in Stockholm.

447
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:44.370
So you're going to get the same thing in Stockholm

448
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.380
<v 5>is you're going to get and how they will that you would get in New York.
Yeah.</v>

449
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.730
Yeah.
Me and that's it.
That's all I can deliver it to me.
You know,
that's uh,

450
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.920
there's something beautiful about that that,
uh,
that's a,

451
00:26:55.921 --> 00:26:58.380
that's a wisdom and an approach,
you know,

452
00:26:58.381 --> 00:27:02.190
and you're 42 they don't necessarily have when you're 21,
you know,

453
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:04.420
when you're 21,
the first time I was doing standup,

454
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.670
you really shouldn't be talking.

455
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.520
You should be listening to your point of view is really irrelevant.
Yeah.

456
00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:13.250
You should be talking about relationships and all that stuff.
Just 21.

457
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.320
It's like stabbing man.
You only had one relationship

458
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:23.220
between black folks and white folks.
You're how old again?
Yeah,

459
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.770
exactly.
All that kind of stuff.
You know,

460
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:31.170
I think back then I wasn't,
man,
when I started I was already in a full grown man.

461
00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.470
He helped me out a lot too.
Yeah.
Cause he's standing.

462
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:38.310
Standup ultimately becomes about your point of view.
It becomes,
you know,
you,
you,

463
00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.480
you breaking down,
this is,
I've,
I've been aligned for x amount of years.

464
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.620
This is how I see it.
Boom.
You know,

465
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.060
that's what you're see your standup eventually becomes eventually.

466
00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.710
And you were already there.

467
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:53.730
You already had so much life experience that did jump in at 42,

468
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.870
you know,
I mean,
oh yeah man.
And then have the nerve to,
uh,

469
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.020
cause it's courage and the courage to stand in and,
you know,

470
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:06.480
tell people this because I think it's funny,
I'm going to hit you with it.

471
00:28:06.481 --> 00:28:07.314
You know,

472
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.810
now we all know as comedians that sometimes you don't get that explosion and you

473
00:28:11.811 --> 00:28:15.480
don't want it.
You don't want that not to happen,
but it's a possibility.

474
00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:19.290
But yet that's the risk we had to take.
Right?
Bombing Sucks bombing us.

475
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:27.100
It's what makes you sharp though.
Fear of it happening.
It's got a sharp,
it's,

476
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.310
you know,
it's much harder.
We out of here right now doing,
uh,

477
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.320
my first TV show where I'm started showing up in the midst of doing it right now

478
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.090
and we're going to be out there for six weeks.
And what does it,

479
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.590
Charlie Murphy Law.
Charlie Murphy's law.
Charlie Murphy,

480
00:28:42.591 --> 00:28:46.610
me as it is to me as a judge,
like judge Mathis or whatever.
Right.

481
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:51.560
But imagine judge Mathis when he goes home
and he has it,
uh,

482
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.410
you know,
judge matters,
his background and he's moved from the street.
Right.

483
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.260
Cause he,
he adopted this kid that's a bad kid.

484
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.820
So He's trying to mentor this kid.
It's,

485
00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.250
it's kind of like the courtship of Eddie's father with your son is not,

486
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.170
he's not soft.

487
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.230
Your son is really a problem every week it's going to be some drama with this

488
00:29:10.231 --> 00:29:13.920
kid where I may have to really,
you know,
you know what I'm saying?
Be Dad.

489
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.370
You know what I'm saying?
To knuckle up and they,
cause he's not,

490
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.370
he's not theall right.
What I'm saying.
Right,
right.
It's a real case.
Real kid.

491
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.900
He's like what most people are dealing with.
Right,
right,
right.
But it's funny,

492
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.840
you know,
so that's,
so if you mix the two,

493
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.080
thinking about night court and that blended together,

494
00:29:31.081 --> 00:29:33.890
that's what the jest of the show is.
It's going to be me and Nightcore.

495
00:29:33.891 --> 00:29:36.420
It's going to be funny stuff in courtroom scenes or whatever,

496
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.530
but it's going to be mainly about me and my relationship with my adoptive son.

497
00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:42.080
I

498
00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.220
<v 4>got to be looking to judge Matt this as your inspiration cause I love judge</v>

499
00:29:45.221 --> 00:29:48.000
Mathis.
Whoa.

500
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.000
<v 5>This is a weird how it was like watching other people go to court.</v>

501
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:57.030
Roe v Wade is that man we like watching other people go to court.

502
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.540
We be like other people to be able to go,
oh you're fucked now dude.

503
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:06.460
I can't believe he says motherfucker doesn't even have receipts.
No receipt.

504
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.753
Why?

505
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:15.040
Why do we like seeing other people fuck up?
I don't think

506
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:19.240
you can get just a nice distraction.

507
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.240
You constantly on their problems so you don't have to think about your own.

508
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.570
We've got some new thing to occupy your mind.
This is true.

509
00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.390
<v 4>I consider judge math is like school down in like it teaches me what not to do.</v>

510
00:30:29.391 --> 00:30:32.900
Just like I do with cocktails as a teaching for 48 like if I were to murder

511
00:30:32.901 --> 00:30:35.030
somebody,
like I know not to do this and that

512
00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:37.990
is begging skills.

513
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.920
He has professional badness.
I wouldn't start.
No,
no tab,

514
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:49.610
which is quick with it.
And he said some bone crushing shit,
man.
I'm telling you.

515
00:30:49.611 --> 00:30:52.700
I was in a radio station with them and his jokes back,

516
00:30:52.701 --> 00:30:56.930
but he really told that deep well that Dj's name,
I don't know,
got started.

517
00:30:56.931 --> 00:30:59.930
He came in and started thought he had to,
you know,
slept in the room.
He came,

518
00:30:59.931 --> 00:31:01.370
we keep,
first it started with Paul.

519
00:31:01.371 --> 00:31:05.450
He didn't know Paul was a comedian and he freezes and he may freeze.

520
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.890
Actually freeze after about 10 minutes.
Hey,
hey,

521
00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.830
are you a professional comedian?

522
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.550
Because the room was that glasses were knocked over and everything.

523
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.460
People were laughing at him.

524
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.660
He came in the room and started it and got blowed out.

525
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.180
It looked like it tall Gary Coleman.
Right.

526
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.540
And that's what free stuck to that whole theme,
the Gary Coleman thing.

527
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.880
This dude was about this time.
Oh Look,

528
00:31:25.881 --> 00:31:30.170
just let Gary ripped them in the room and then we went into the,
the,
the booth,

529
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.890
the actual room to do the interview.
Judge Mathis,
isn't it?

530
00:31:33.891 --> 00:31:37.010
So the guy just finished getting embarrassed by freeze.

531
00:31:37.011 --> 00:31:39.480
He wants to redeem himself.
He says something,

532
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.410
you judge Mathis and judge Mathis took it to the next level.
It was,

533
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:47.870
it was like they played a relay race where they guy but ping pong.

534
00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:50.660
He hasn't wig handing them off the judge man.

535
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:55.430
What a judge Mathis destroyed him.
He destroyed him.
Says,

536
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:59.960
first of all,
I just climb up out of that hole when you're talking.

537
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.473
<v 5>Wow.</v>

538
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.060
Judge Talking Shit to you.

539
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.940
<v 4>And then at one point my man said something about uh,</v>

540
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.200
downtown La.
Oh yeah.
He said some of my transvestites and inducing,
yeah.

541
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:26.250
Yeah,
it does.
Madness.
I know you want to go to an NCO limb transvestite.

542
00:32:26.251 --> 00:32:29.280
He didn't judge Madsen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I do want to go there.

543
00:32:29.281 --> 00:32:34.281
I met so I could watch you stand up and suck Dick and dude was like real short.

544
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:38.693
<v 5>Whoa.</v>

545
00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:44.160
Throwing him under the bus right now as this information that can get him.

546
00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.260
He's a real man in prison and shit.

547
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:51.110
That dude's awesome.
We know what to tell a short dude.

548
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.780
Sackers watch you standing up a sec.

549
00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.790
Dick that's dead was weird is the brain's was okay.
Don't,

550
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:59.960
don't get it twisted that that's what made me go judge Matt is the real deal.

551
00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:04.220
Yeah.
He hit this dude so hard man to do.
Shut up the rest of the interview.

552
00:33:04.221 --> 00:33:08.050
He was scared to talk,
man.
He was scared to ask questions.

553
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.030
He would kick me for scheduling ourself after

554
00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:15.660
great moments and criminal history.
True Hollywood stories with judgment.

555
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:23.020
I love church.
I can watch you.
I'm supposed to Tommy,

556
00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:31.490
I'm supposed to ask you about Johnny Gill who thought he could beat Oscar de la

557
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:34.900
Hoya.
Oh yeah,
man.
You know why nobody told me.
Somebody told me.

558
00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.270
How did you know about that one man?
I think it was Thompson.

559
00:33:37.271 --> 00:33:38.600
Gloria told Matt that was,
that was,

560
00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.540
that was one of the days when that's back when the was still,
you know,

561
00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:43.820
fighting too.
That's what made me really angry.

562
00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.970
Ask her was whipping somebodies ass and I'm sitting next to a balladeer,

563
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.320
you know,
I respect you.
You get singing on that,

564
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:53.860
but don't point to know frankly and go,
I could whip him.

565
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.980
I don't want to hit that man.

566
00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:58.690
He really said that vehemently man jumped up and I even,

567
00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.990
I even up to the fact that you brought it up,
it ain't like I'm snitching.

568
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.800
I told him,
if I ever see you asking him the same room,

569
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.650
making sure that ask it knows that you feel that way.

570
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.600
I want to be there.
I'm making sure he knows that you uh,

571
00:34:14.601 --> 00:34:19.440
balladeer crooner said that you can whip them out.
Yeah,
man,
that was a,

572
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:22.370
to me that was the highest incidence of the highest level man.

573
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.661
You make your money,

574
00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:27.400
you roses flat in the and all that saying you gonna look at it.

575
00:34:27.401 --> 00:34:31.850
Finding and talking about how could whip him.
Come on man.
He needs to know that.

576
00:34:31.851 --> 00:34:33.350
He needs to know you feel that way.

577
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.270
I did it with Mike tasting and ran for house.
He used to talk shit.
Oh yeah,
my,

578
00:34:40.271 --> 00:34:42.860
my mouth do this and that.
The Mac Bababababa so I,

579
00:34:42.861 --> 00:34:44.690
one day we were all together and I said,
you don't mind.

580
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:48.680
This dude told me whip your ass man.

581
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.400
He really,
he tells me all the time,
why don't you tell him Mike,

582
00:34:52.401 --> 00:34:57.200
would you be telling me
watch them turning the Koolaid,
his chair?

583
00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.420
He said,
Mike,
he didn't say nothing.
She didn't say nothing to me.

584
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.230
That was my whole point.
I mean you probably encounter before,

585
00:35:06.231 --> 00:35:09.990
I've been in the hood up in the barbershop sometime and I got to tell folks my

586
00:35:09.991 --> 00:35:14.140
and be like Yo man cause Mike,
you know Mike,
Mike,
Nothing man.
What do you,

587
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:17.570
you work for ups,
right?
Don't bring up Max names,

588
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.510
staff it bring up another truck drive.

589
00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:25.130
Cause I'll take me out to Gleason's rate now and pick out any heavyweight.

590
00:35:25.131 --> 00:35:28.970
Somebody who you've never seen on TV and he'll make you call them integrators

591
00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.910
stabbing man you don't,
you got to fire.

592
00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:33.520
You don't do what this guy does respect what he does.

593
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:35.420
I him jumping around and we'll have your truck.

594
00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.800
I'm trying to beat you on your router.
That going to happen.

595
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:45.930
<v 0>It happened man.
Let's get delusional about their ability to kick ass.</v>

596
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:51.020
He really thought he back in the day,
I don't have been.
Maybe he's more.

597
00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:56.280
Thank you.
Just think that he felt,
he felt he was more powerful,

598
00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:01.370
faster.
I said,
well,
you never boxed before as an the duty.

599
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.370
I'm talking about being a man.
I was like,
what are you

600
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:09.660
talking about being a man,

601
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.680
talking about being a man.

602
00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.850
That's a dude that doesn't understand what an eight week campus or like an eight

603
00:36:17.851 --> 00:36:19.440
week trial he was.
He was Buffy,

604
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.460
I think he was working out with bag of bars and he had a little cut on

605
00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:26.670
everything.
I was like,
you know those muscles don't translate to a win,
Bro.

606
00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:32.040
People get translate to best in show at the bodybuilding cancer context,

607
00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:35.100
not that you and to win the fight.
And if you look at real fighters,

608
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.190
they don't have the chiseled body like Gi Joe.
Know what I'm saying?

609
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.230
Look at Anderson Silva.
Look at his body looked normal man.
Yeah.

610
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.510
And look what happens when those dudes come in with the,

611
00:36:43.511 --> 00:36:46.590
you know the Gi Joe Kit Classic.

612
00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:50.850
The problem with all that muscle muscles,
it needs fuel.
Yup.
You gotta,

613
00:36:50.851 --> 00:36:53.790
you gotta feed up and see you only good for about 30 seconds,

614
00:36:53.791 --> 00:36:56.040
20 seconds of full fury.

615
00:36:56.070 --> 00:37:00.040
When you're all big like that guy can hang on to you.
It's like riding a bull,

616
00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.220
you know,
but the real bad endurance,
then you burn it.

617
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.740
You just ride them to be aware of themselves at harms.
They fill up with blood,

618
00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:10.370
then they can't move.
They get heavy.
It's crazy.

619
00:37:10.371 --> 00:37:13.470
You watch like there's a guy named Marius [inaudible],

620
00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:17.730
strong world's strongest man does those crazy fucking things where they throw

621
00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:21.470
the beer bottles in the air and the cars and shit.
You know that strong man shit.

622
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:26.100
He's one of the bunch of times and he just started doing MMA and he gets fucked

623
00:37:26.101 --> 00:37:30.180
up by fat cat.
He's throwing some punches and kicks her.

624
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:34.410
Tim Silvia beat the fuck out of that boy.
He had that dude purple.

625
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:38.310
Purple is Tim Silvia was like,
how dare you.

626
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:42.300
I was a fucking two time heavyweight champion.
We're more a maybe,
I don't know.

627
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:46.740
Either way.
It's a fucking world UFC heavyweight champion.

628
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.700
And you think that you can pick up a car so you can kick his ass.

629
00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:55.320
It was like a slow,
methodical ass kicking by.
Uh,
an overweight guy.

630
00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:59.510
Essentially.
We've got what the car's not moving cars cards,
you know,

631
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:03.240
doing techniques.
But if they can get you in those first 15 seconds,

632
00:38:03.241 --> 00:38:05.940
you can have a real big fucking problem.
Cause for those,

633
00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:09.050
those guys get street people are like,
you know,
yeah.

634
00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:13.050
That guy who could throw a car goes to the supermarket and you get an argument.

635
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.930
He could probably throw you across the meat section.
Yeah,

636
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.450
your back or something you're going to be on.

637
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:23.340
Expect it to me across the meat section.
But you ain't an MMA fighter.
You know,

638
00:38:23.341 --> 00:38:27.090
you ain't a boxer,
you ain't whatever.
Any,
any kind of professional athlete,

639
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:30.540
whatever professionally is in respected.
Don't disrespect.

640
00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:31.590
Now you're thinking today though.

641
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:36.380
Now you got me thinking about fights in supermarkets.
Yeah,
Dude.
Yeah man does.

642
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:40.630
There's no weight classes in supermarkets.
No Way.
This dude was talking about

643
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:43.310
<v 4>jumping on that was wanting to Renick bags</v>

644
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.960
and I asked him,
yeah,
it was the same size physically.
I was like,

645
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:51.710
you really think you could beat that guy?
He said,
we're the same size as I said.

646
00:38:51.711 --> 00:38:56.010
Yeah,
but I've seen him run over five guys,
his size and Mc and you run over,

647
00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.040
get a hard time going up the steps and you to mess

648
00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:03.910
<v 0>this boy.
You know what I'm saying?
You got the same size but you don't.</v>

649
00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:04.960
I ain't the same thing man.

650
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:08.930
People don't understand a super athlete understanding until that's why.

651
00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:13.270
That's why we have the ability to buck our eyes.
Express that,

652
00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.000
to express that.
When you get surprised.
Oh Shit,

653
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:23.980
I didn't mean it wasn't practicing.
Exactly.
Yeah.

654
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.560
You can't hang out with dudes and talk shit.
Talk Shit about hey,

655
00:39:27.561 --> 00:39:30.980
how they'd fight Mike Tyson.
Get those guys are useless.

656
00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.250
<v 4>But now I'm telling you,</v>

657
00:39:32.251 --> 00:39:35.220
if you come around me talking about who you could whip it,

658
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.250
cause a lot of my friends would phrase and I've seen him in the room.

659
00:39:38.251 --> 00:39:40.800
I'm not just letting them know that you feel.
That's how I,

660
00:39:40.801 --> 00:39:43.920
that's how I wrote it was funny as fuck you feel

661
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.920
<v 0>it was me,
bladder,
brack,
blah blah.
Brad Blackburn,</v>

662
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:50.830
Maury Smith and one other,

663
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:55.860
uh Oh Ivan salivary all UFC fighters or Cape kickboxers and we're all out at a

664
00:39:58.001 --> 00:40:01.700
restaurant.
And Charlie is convincing everybody that,

665
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:06.250
that the rich hand that y'all are sleeping on the ridge hand.

666
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
And he was talking about that on the Chicago Ridge hand,

667
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:14.250
the different types of rich hands.
And they were,
they were laughing.

668
00:40:14.251 --> 00:40:16.170
They would try and say,
Yay like you,
you can't even,

669
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.760
but Charlie's stuck his fucking gun
man.

670
00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.900
And one of the big first UFC joints,

671
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:28.390
my med check with Delta knocked out Yarbrough originating chocolate gum.

672
00:40:28.391 --> 00:40:32.360
Never fuck y'all bro.
He fought some big thing to Keith Hackney.
Fuck y'all bro.

673
00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:36.030
Yeah,
he did though.
He hit him.
He hit him with a Lego,
uh,

674
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:39.580
an open palm strike to the head too.
He hit him with a bunch of different things,

675
00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:43.790
but he definitely,
but I would never use it.
Raise your hand.

676
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:50.490
Open Palm.
Strike that.
That even sounds like it's just going to yell.

677
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.120
But listen to her who just,

678
00:40:52.121 --> 00:40:56.190
who just executed a beautiful over palm strike national television.

679
00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.360
All give a round of applause right now the way Rupert Murdoch,

680
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:04.220
round of applause,
man.

681
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.480
What happened to see the press conference when Rupert Murdoch was getting

682
00:41:07.481 --> 00:41:10.630
interviewed and this dude tried to come in with the Pi and hit him from the side

683
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.560
and his wife came out with the open hand palm strack and broke his nose.

684
00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:18.070
Whoa wife this young.
She's not old like him.

685
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.980
He has it like she's like in the thirties man.
Look at him.

686
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:25.990
She didn't even hit 30 year old pizza ass shows fighting bandaid on his nose and

687
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:30.510
broke his nose.
Man.
Rupert Murdoch,
you know,

688
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.820
despite of all evil intention and she's hot though.

689
00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:38.830
He's a bad motherfucker when that guy's got a lot of power in this world and in

690
00:41:39.391 --> 00:41:43.370
any Booper kick.
Yeah,
that's incredible it.
That's what you could say.

691
00:41:43.371 --> 00:41:46.280
You get it at all.
We could tell you wait,
you go take care of that day.

692
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:51.410
She comes over to us.
She knows martial laws.
By the way,

693
00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:53.600
she went straight to the palmier striker.

694
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:57.410
Wait to did a nose to beat you up with Yoga.

695
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:03.770
She came with it,
man.
What an old school move though.
Hitting somebody with a pie.

696
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.510
<v 5>Shaving cream.
We were taught what?</v>

697
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.770
What's so funny about the whole thing is not long before that we were just

698
00:42:11.771 --> 00:42:12.760
talking.
We were like,

699
00:42:12.761 --> 00:42:17.500
what is the defense with that rallies in Charlotte asked Joe First.

700
00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:19.600
Okay.
Let's say you was,
if he was doing something

701
00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:24.640
<v 0>live and somebody did that to you,
would you laugh it off?
Um,</v>

702
00:42:24.641 --> 00:42:29.260
it really depends.
Depends on if I felt a malice from them.

703
00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:32.860
If I felt like they hated me,
if I felt like,
you know,
there were,

704
00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:34.490
there were lasting Yan embarrassed,

705
00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.540
but people try to embarrass people just because they're idiots and they want

706
00:42:37.541 --> 00:42:40.360
attention.
They would,
it would all depend entirely on the moment.

707
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:44.460
But I would hope that I wouldn't do anything stupid.
So I said,
man,

708
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:47.190
I said was I would whip the person's ass.
Right?

709
00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.410
And then he just does something stupid.
This is what he pointed out and was fine.

710
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:55.390
He said,
but you have to remember this child wants to pass on your face.

711
00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:58.960
Whatever you do after that you're doing with pioneer

712
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.410
<v 5>instant comedy.</v>

713
00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.420
To me it would depend on the Pi.
It'll be delicious.
It was like,

714
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:18.920
what is that limit?
Marangu fuck.
Yeah.
Thank you sir.

715
00:43:18.921 --> 00:43:22.790
Are you going to get hit in the face?
It's going to happen.

716
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:28.140
<v 0>Yeah.
It's like you'll be fighting with paying your face.
I was
just like,</v>

717
00:43:28.141 --> 00:43:31.500
there's a lot of prior,
just like there's a lot of dummies that we'll look at.

718
00:43:31.501 --> 00:43:34.140
A guy like Mike Tyson,
I really think that they can kick his ass.

719
00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:38.190
There are people that look at a guy like you like on stage and they get upset at

720
00:43:38.191 --> 00:43:41.880
you for some reason and they get upset at you for getting that attention to get

721
00:43:41.881 --> 00:43:45.410
up so early but they feel like they should be getting what you have.

722
00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:49.020
I thank God every chair,
every time one of them have stepped up.

723
00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:53.810
I had a baseball bat of jokes,
you know my,
my,
my,

724
00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:57.030
my reaction was always right on time.

725
00:43:57.031 --> 00:44:01.910
Laser sharp and they was birthed out of the audience like a cigarette butt,

726
00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.650
you know,
and he's been in a witness it and I've been in the witness,

727
00:44:04.651 --> 00:44:07.950
you doing it.
I think you're one of the best I've ever seen do it.

728
00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:11.150
You inspired me when I seen it.
The how

729
00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:14.910
<v 5>you took it.
That was like,
well I could go much harder.</v>

730
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.410
Joe Is telling him this person man,
wow.
You know what I'm saying?
Can

731
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:20.920
<v 0>I see you evaporate?</v>

732
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:25.040
People says that me that told me that it's something that you definitely got to

733
00:44:25.041 --> 00:44:27.020
have as part of your game.

734
00:44:27.021 --> 00:44:29.210
If you're going to be standing up on the stage talking to people,

735
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.070
you have to have the ability to,
you

736
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.910
<v 4>know to do that.
If it comes up and got to shoot them down and keep it moving,</v>

737
00:44:35.911 --> 00:44:39.000
you can't be haggling with them and you know cause that's going to break the

738
00:44:39.001 --> 00:44:40.350
whole continuity of the show up.

739
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:43.140
The guys that can just hit him with the hammer and keep it moving

740
00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.420
<v 3>best.
But it's an unfortunate side effect of comedy.
But we started out freezing.</v>

741
00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.680
I were fucking comedy store veterans man.

742
00:44:50.681 --> 00:44:53.470
And that was a place that nobody patrolled.

743
00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:58.750
There was no manager Shush in the room does the comedy store was run by the guy

744
00:44:58.751 --> 00:45:02.620
on stage and occasionally dude's got kicked out because the comic would go just

745
00:45:02.621 --> 00:45:06.100
get these fucking people out of here.
God Damn.
It would get,

746
00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:09.680
it would get to the point where it was just you had to kick them out and board

747
00:45:09.681 --> 00:45:12.520
the show couldn't go on,
but there was always something there.

748
00:45:12.521 --> 00:45:14.590
That place is always drama.

749
00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:17.680
I've had glasses thrown at me on stage there.

750
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.920
I've seen I w we remembered when a Holtzman got knocked out by Martin Lawrence,

751
00:45:23.071 --> 00:45:26.770
his body.
God Damn.

752
00:45:26.771 --> 00:45:29.330
That place was chaos.
I remember.

753
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:33.280
<v 2>Wow.
I remember Eddie Griffin,
we,
we were in the main room.
We had a show.</v>

754
00:45:33.281 --> 00:45:37.600
It was Martin Luther King's birthday and after the show,

755
00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:41.020
this was the,
when the Dj came on,

756
00:45:41.021 --> 00:45:43.930
this is the first time I heard the song a no Vaseline.

757
00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:46.200
Yeah.

758
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.950
The Dj played it and Dr Dre and all of the dog pound and it was about doctor

759
00:45:50.951 --> 00:45:52.480
Joe.
Yeah.
They were all there and,

760
00:45:52.481 --> 00:45:56.260
and dre went up on stage and snatched the record off of the,

761
00:45:56.261 --> 00:46:00.980
off the turntable and snapped it in half and that kicked off a riot.

762
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.150
Trek was in there.
Tupac was in their trach,

763
00:46:04.151 --> 00:46:08.310
had that big change with the padlock on it.
He was swinging that over his head.

764
00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:12.400
Oh my God.
This went on in the main room on Martin Luther King's birthday.

765
00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:17.600
<v 3>Wow.
I remember that.
Holy Shit.</v>

766
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:20.660
Fucking crazy man.

767
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.880
<v 4>His last wave plan was your prize laughs.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

768
00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.370
Seeing that where there's women out there,
but the counties,

769
00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.760
I was in the parking lot,

770
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:33.810
Richard Pryor was performing that night and she was standing by the back door

771
00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:37.250
and this other chick came around.
It was,
it was getting any come up about her.

772
00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:39.040
She's,
they knew each other.
Harvard,
she,

773
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:43.080
she said that other chick did not tell you anything to come no more,
which shows

774
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:49.920
every time she hit it,
another piece of jury came off too.
When she got finished,

775
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:54.810
all of this women's rings and necklaces and everything and her wig was laying
on.

776
00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.100
Wow.
And they was dragging her away,
man.

777
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:03.570
And then Richard Pride when on stages that 20 minutes on what just happened.

778
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.120
<v 3>Classic took it straight to the state.</v>

779
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:11.400
What year was this?

780
00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.910
<v 4>They had to be eight in the eighties man.
You're like 89 90 something like that.</v>

781
00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.130
Could you imagine if you fucking video tape down.

782
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:23.350
Can you imagine if you had a video tape on the mom says they're not taking it to

783
00:47:23.351 --> 00:47:27.070
come no more than that,
which just shows pop pop and started firing on him.

784
00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:31.890
<v 3>How beautiful would that video be to watch that watch the ass kicking to prior</v>

785
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:35.760
walking on stage to prior talking about the ass kicking to pray all it went all

786
00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:37.930
three show.
Don't want to miss it.
Yeah,

787
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:46.030
I performed at 20 minutes but just having that in that I performed with Richard

788
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:49.510
Pryor for a few weeks right at the end.
Right when he was,

789
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.770
when he stopped performing,
when he was in a wheelchair.
My,

790
00:47:52.771 --> 00:47:55.460
when they used to carry him on stage in the or room,

791
00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:00.100
I had to go on after him for for weeks,
for weeks.
When he did that,

792
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:03.890
I always knew I was those the only spot Mitzi always gave me right after Richard

793
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:04.140
Pryor,

794
00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:09.140
you go on there to reteach you would you would eat dick like no other time.

795
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:15.320
<v 2>Yeah,
cause it wasn't,
it was sad.
It was sad,
you know?
I mean,</v>

796
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:21.000
it was cool because once Richard would open his mouth,
it was him.
Right.

797
00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:24.620
I mean,
you know,
you could tell that he's,
and then it was,

798
00:48:24.621 --> 00:48:28.190
it was a weird effect because you'd be like,
oh Yo,
he's still there.

799
00:48:28.191 --> 00:48:32.810
He's still in there.
But then you'd be like,
wait a minute,
he's in there.

800
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:36.090
That's his body now.
And that's what he's,
he's kind of,

801
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:41.280
it seemed like he was more in prison after you heard him do stand up because it

802
00:48:42.261 --> 00:48:47.261
was a realization like this is a man who has his wits but does not have his,

803
00:48:47.731 --> 00:48:52.520
his motor skills and his,
its functions is bodily functions too,

804
00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:57.620
to match up with his wit.
Right,
right.
And that was,
that just was,

805
00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:01.730
even though he was funny,
even though his sharp,
that just,
it was sad.

806
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:04.410
<v 3>It was,
it seemed to me like there was a,</v>

807
00:49:04.411 --> 00:49:06.810
there was a disconnect too towards the end.
He,

808
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:08.580
I don't think he was completely lucid.

809
00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:11.050
So when he would go on stage and talk about things like,

810
00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:15.750
they didn't always make sense.
And you know,
was,
uh,
it was,
it was,
he was dying,

811
00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:16.590
you know,

812
00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:20.430
and he would get this huge round of applause when he got offstage where people

813
00:49:20.431 --> 00:49:23.430
just say,
you know,
hey man,
when you look at him right now,
man,

814
00:49:23.431 --> 00:49:26.430
there's not much time left.
And this is one of the greatest comedians,

815
00:49:26.431 --> 00:49:29.040
maybe the greatest comedian to ever walk the face of the planet.

816
00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.860
The most influential I think of all time.

817
00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:34.440
And you're walking and watching them as they're carrying him away.

818
00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:38.430
And then they introduce you Jeff edge against on the piano.
Ladies and gentlemen,

819
00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:43.170
Joe are all getting from hardball on Fox TV.

820
00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:44.880
Please welcome Joe Rogan.

821
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:49.050
And you go on stage and you have to do stand up after Richard and it takes at

822
00:49:49.051 --> 00:49:52.980
least four or five minutes to get them out of the room cause they're walking

823
00:49:52.981 --> 00:49:55.290
with him out of the room.
They have to,
cause he can't really walk.

824
00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:59.070
So they have to carry him and walk with them really slowly and everybody's

825
00:49:59.071 --> 00:50:03.840
clapping and standing,
you know,
like a war veteran just got off stage,
you know?

826
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:08.950
<v 4>Awesome.
That's who did just get off stage.
Yeah,
it's good one.
Yeah,</v>

827
00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:13.120
definitely man.
Yeah,
I've seen that.
That type of,

828
00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:17.290
you know that work in spirit and in other artists too.

829
00:50:17.291 --> 00:50:22.291
Like Sammy Davis Jr last film he ever did was a kid who loves Christmas and I

830
00:50:23.951 --> 00:50:27.420
would happen to be in that movie and he,
that's when he was dying and

831
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.270
<v 0>I wouldn't came to work with,
he was,
he was there every day,
you know,
he was,</v>

832
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:36.770
he died like a week or two after we finished shooting.
He was advanced cancer,

833
00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.790
but he won't work anyway.
Man.
Patrick Swayze did it too.
Right.

834
00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.370
It's coming to work anyhow,
I guess.
Why not?
Fuck it.

835
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.970
Just go out doing what you like doing.
You think that's what Steve jobs is done.

836
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.590
Do you think that's why he stepped down today?

837
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.310
Do you know that Steve Jobs so stepped down from Apple Appleton?

838
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:56.960
I hope it doesn't change.
It's like,
well,
I don't know man.
Dude has like,

839
00:50:56.990 --> 00:51:00.500
he had pancreatic cancer,
didn't they?
Or liver cancer?
I think something crazy.

840
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:03.530
He had to get a liver transplant from fighting the cancer.

841
00:51:03.531 --> 00:51:04.470
Wasn't that what it was?
Yeah.

842
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:06.320
But never got fucked up from the chemo or something.

843
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:09.460
<v 7>Thank you.
Had Magic Johnson,
that shit's like quickly like this.</v>

844
00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:14.390
Now he'll pay for it and it'd be done.
He just has the,

845
00:51:14.391 --> 00:51:17.210
all the money in the road.
You think there would,
there would be,
you know,

846
00:51:17.211 --> 00:51:20.800
that's just kind of just show you that there really isn't any help for some of

847
00:51:20.801 --> 00:51:25.430
that for cancer.
You know,
you can,
you can fix aids,
but cancer,

848
00:51:25.431 --> 00:51:27.590
you can't stop it no matter how much money you have.

849
00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:30.940
<v 0>I think some people have a genetic clashing,
they can just get it.</v>

850
00:51:30.941 --> 00:51:32.430
They just have a badge and antics thing.

851
00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:36.460
They're most likely gonna die of cancer young.
That's very possible.

852
00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.300
But there's also a thing to be said for guy works as hard as Steve Jobs,

853
00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:42.640
but that shit is just not healthy.
You know,
you're,

854
00:51:42.641 --> 00:51:44.860
you're hitting that red line all the time.

855
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.140
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

856
00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:51.670
<v 0>Fucking engine is constantly going,
man.
And I don't think that's healthy.
Oh No,</v>

857
00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:56.770
this can't be,
it can't be,
that's not fun.
If it's not fun,
it's not healthy.

858
00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:01.090
You know?
It's that simple.
Do Europe,
billionaire son,
man.
Yeah.
And it's like,
Yo,

859
00:52:01.091 --> 00:52:05.740
you have done it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He really likes you really can eat some cookies.

860
00:52:05.741 --> 00:52:08.980
Works in TV.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.

861
00:52:08.981 --> 00:52:12.240
He's got eat like oatmeal cookies with like maple sugar.
Okay.

862
00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:16.570
He's got like some serious issues with his health.
He's pretty fucked up,

863
00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:19.930
you know.
And you know,
I dunno how much of that's genetic.
I Dunno.

864
00:52:19.931 --> 00:52:22.780
I Dunno about that argument.
You know,
how much is genetic,
how much of it as well.

865
00:52:22.781 --> 00:52:27.760
I think a lot of it has to do with diet man.
You know,
genetic diet,
all that.

866
00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:29.890
Yeah.
And it's also stressed and you know,

867
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:33.130
just dress a lot of executives like Hollywood executives,

868
00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.810
a lot of those older guys,

869
00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:38.770
they start getting really sick and I think it's a lot of it is just the
pressure.

870
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:40.930
You know,
I need this one guy,

871
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.340
he used to work for my ex girlfriend or my ex girlfriend used to work for him or

872
00:52:45.341 --> 00:52:50.050
other real nice guy,
just 50 years old,
had cancer,

873
00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.490
you know,
out of nowhere.

874
00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:55.540
And he was dead within weeks and it was just the weirdest thing ever.

875
00:52:55.541 --> 00:52:58.600
It just seemed like this nice guy,
like,
hey Bob,
what's going on?
Nice to see Ya.

876
00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:03.010
He's always laughing and joking around and then boom,
whatever it was,

877
00:53:03.011 --> 00:53:04.600
just hit him and hit him quick.

878
00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:10.050
And all of a sudden we had killed my father and my wife and put both of them.

879
00:53:10.481 --> 00:53:13.600
It was like,
you know,
they get sick.

880
00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.540
They went to the doctor and he was diagnosed.

881
00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.250
They went into treatment and he passed away.
She wasn't like a,
you know,

882
00:53:21.251 --> 00:53:25.080
it was a long battle.
Him,
you know,
and,

883
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:29.990
<v 4>and,
and we both of them,
like my dad,
he smoked,
but when he was young,</v>

884
00:53:29.991 --> 00:53:31.780
he was an athlete.
All right.

885
00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:37.450
My wife didn't smoke and drink and do drugs that are worked out,

886
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:42.860
drink water every day,
didn't eat meat.
Wow.
None of that.
But still,

887
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:47.440
she didn't,
she passed away before she was 40,
and it was diagnosed,

888
00:53:47.441 --> 00:53:48.274
uh,

889
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:52.900
six months after my daughter was born because he wouldn't have to keep it off

890
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:56.570
the followup checkups and then boom,
you get cancer and man.

891
00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:01.840
So it's very deadly in in its origins a are a mystery because it can be what you

892
00:54:03.561 --> 00:54:04.280
eat.

893
00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:09.280
It could be it's in your family or it could just be you or your personality.

894
00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.540
You're very tense person and you create an created within yourself.

895
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:17.830
It's deep,
very scary disease,
right?

896
00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.150
<v 0>Yeah.
Imbalance is a,
is a frightening thing when it comes to your health.</v>

897
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:24.640
You know when it really could be terminal,

898
00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.610
like you're going to have a terminal imbalance.
You could get,

899
00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.510
your whole system is so fucked up from thinking the wrong way,

900
00:54:31.511 --> 00:54:35.650
doing the wrong way,
eating the wrong way,
treating your body like shit,

901
00:54:35.651 --> 00:54:39.600
treating people like shit.
And then next thing you know it,
holding on to anger,

902
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.890
hold on,
grab all that kind of stuff.
Holding grudges,

903
00:54:41.891 --> 00:54:46.480
all of that stuff is manifest some way.
Resolving a garage,

904
00:54:46.481 --> 00:54:49.810
it's one of the best feelings ever.
When you're cool with somebody,

905
00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.090
you know when you weren't cool with them and then all of a sudden you're cool

906
00:54:52.091 --> 00:54:56.890
with them.
So a nice feeling.
It's like a,
it's a good as a human being,

907
00:54:56.891 --> 00:55:00.430
I took a good feeling,
you know?
That's most definitely.
Yeah.

908
00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:03.690
But keeping one and just thinking about this mother fucker.
If I see this,

909
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:07.210
just hold it out in the shit like that.
Going over fake arguments and you had,

910
00:55:07.211 --> 00:55:10.220
if he says this,
I don't want to say that.
It would have been

911
00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.810
for a long time.

912
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:16.420
<v 4>I would,
I,
you know,
I had to learn it.
Don't keep writing.</v>

913
00:55:16.421 --> 00:55:19.730
Just don't dwell on negative,
you know,
I had to learn it.

914
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:24.400
<v 0>Yeah.
You want to be hard.
Do you want to tell them to fuck themselves for life?</v>

915
00:55:24.401 --> 00:55:28.330
Bitch,
I was,
I was,
I was reading on Twitter the other day,

916
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.580
somebody from a tweak,

917
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:35.320
a quote from Ben Della and he said,
um,

918
00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:38.770
resentment is like,
it's like a,

919
00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:43.210
it's like drinking a bottle of poison to kill your enemy.
Whoa.

920
00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:48.130
That's deep.
That is deep.
It is true.
Tell,
Yeah.
Yeah.

921
00:55:48.131 --> 00:55:49.780
It's almost like,
you know,

922
00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:54.870
you got to figure out a way to make people like to make people that you hate.

923
00:55:55.181 --> 00:55:56.080
People that know you.

924
00:55:56.081 --> 00:56:00.220
People that only become a source of positivity to you.

925
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:02.740
Right.
Figure out a way to,

926
00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:06.790
no matter how conti somebody gets guests with you never let it affect you.

927
00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:10.470
Only take it as a source of vins ratio.
Right.

928
00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:14.020
Twitter has made me better with with that cause it's constantly asshole.

929
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:20.950
Yeah,
that drives me nuts.

930
00:56:20.951 --> 00:56:24.220
When people talk shit there and man gotten into a few people,

931
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:28.360
<v 5>then I realized
going back and forth,
this person,
man,</v>

932
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:31.180
it probably playing right now of course get lit up.

933
00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:36.380
<v 2>You said,
you explained to me,
he said,
Yo,
don't forget.
Look,</v>

934
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:41.660
somebody says some real smart allocators are some some bullshit to you and then

935
00:56:41.661 --> 00:56:44.240
you look and they got like seven followers,

936
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:47.500
but you retweeted what they said and what you're going to do to them.

937
00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:51.700
<v 5>Now.
How did you gather people's reading
or reading?</v>

938
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:55.460
I know this person.
Anyone know what's going on?
You what I'm saying?

939
00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:59.290
The best thing to do is just don't even respond.
You can't,

940
00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:03.830
you can't get just block them.
Block crazy every,
yeah,
I just block them.

941
00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:06.440
People want to talk a lot of shit.
They want to be angry,
man.

942
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:09.650
It's like you could choose to fuck what you choose to put on that.

943
00:57:09.651 --> 00:57:14.060
Twitter is a direct reflection of you as a human being.
When you send out there,

944
00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:18.360
that's you,
man.
And if you get country,
I don't need,
I don't need you and man,

945
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.860
I don't need you in the mix.
Put that block on you.

946
00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.180
You take care of that and go back.

947
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.450
You want to talk to me that the way we should meet somewhere.

948
00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.610
Do you know how to get to the dock?

949
00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:38.420
It's funny how many people out there looking to find somebody to hate.

950
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:42.590
That's a lot of people,
man,
and a lot of people looking for you to stumble.

951
00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.980
Point fingers.
You go fuck yourself.

952
00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:48.720
<v 2>I want to do that.
They want to,
you know?
I don't know.</v>

953
00:57:48.721 --> 00:57:53.100
I guess this people feel a lot of times that if you're failing,

954
00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:57.950
then that makes them doing good.
I'm doing good.
I'm not Finna see.
Look,
look,
look,

955
00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:58.390
look.

956
00:57:58.390 --> 00:58:02.730
<v 5>It failing.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's the worst.</v>

957
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:04.900
I'm happy to see him fail that piece of shit.
You're like,
man,

958
00:58:04.901 --> 00:58:08.170
you don't even know that dude.
This dude never ever met that dude.

959
00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:09.840
I'm glad it's not the opposite end.

960
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:12.250
Would hate to have everyone try to kiss you all the time.
Like,

961
00:58:12.251 --> 00:58:16.600
like write your nice little love letters every day.
Who would it be late today?

962
00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:18.610
Who Do you think would be the most annoying to be

963
00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:21.870
<v 4>in that respect?
Either one of them.
Man,</v>

964
00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:26.380
he could tell you I broke up with his girl once.
Faxing me.
Am I okay?

965
00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:30.180
She just kept saying,
Oh really?
Oh do you?
Okay.

966
00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:33.980
<v 5>Yeah,
maybe I'm fine.
I'm fine.</v>

967
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:38.960
<v 4>Why don't you go get some money?
She come back.
Are you okay?
Yeah,</v>

968
00:58:38.961 --> 00:58:42.950
I'm okay.
20 minutes later.
And then they even noticed it.

969
00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:47.870
So I finally said to her,
look,
I'm a grown man.
Why do you keep asking me?
I'm out.

970
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:49.243
<v 5>Said,</v>

971
00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:58.970
what did you say?
What

972
00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:02.183
really

973
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:14.300
helped me with my problem?
I said,
never asked me.
I'm okay again.

974
00:59:14.301 --> 00:59:15.134
Do you understand?

975
00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:19.540
<v 4>Are you okay?
Had to storm out of the room.</v>

976
00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:24.220
<v 5>Maybe she just wanted to talk,
but it wasn't a good sentence starter.
She was,</v>

977
00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:28.820
she had a problem.
She had a problem.
She had problems with.

978
00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.800
It was weird.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She was really weird.
I guess that's,

979
00:59:32.801 --> 00:59:33.634
that's the way to put it.

980
00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:36.380
As soon as dick whipped to the point where it's irritating,

981
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:40.240
he just broke her down.
She just asking.
I don't,
we all care.

982
00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:44.633
<v 1>Damn.</v>

983
00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:49.100
<v 5>Wow.
You didn't want that to be a finger.
You don't want somebody who,</v>

984
00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:52.980
you know that's too much.
She was just to India.

985
00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:56.970
Yeah mate.
Somebody that can be too in need.
You know what I mean?
It's irritating.

986
00:59:57.190 --> 01:00:02.190
Come on man.
Back up,
man.
I Dunno man.
That sounds pretty good to me.

987
01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:06.150
Yeah,
no,
just need a few of them.
You had to experience

988
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:11.610
it felt sorry because she landed the role.

989
01:00:11.611 --> 01:00:13.530
She's pacing in the hallway in front of my door.

990
01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:16.950
Whatever are you doing here at your back?
I can't see if you're okay.

991
01:00:16.951 --> 01:00:18.090
Can you see if your k

992
01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:21.790
<v 1>yeah,
she hot.</v>

993
01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:25.630
<v 5>She was nice looking with that.
Made it ugly,
man.
Oh,
you really stuff.</v>

994
01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:27.220
She did it to the point where it was like,
look,

995
01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.450
I'm avoiding it or course and did you ever tell her stop asking several times.

996
01:00:31.451 --> 01:00:34.750
She wouldn't stop.
She couldn't step.
What was the issues?
She crazy.

997
01:00:34.751 --> 01:00:38.680
She was a little,
no,
a little bit.
She's a little,
she said,

998
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:41.230
I'm obsessed with you.
I was like,
well,
it means that you have,

999
01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.470
you should go talk to a psychiatrist if you have sex with anyone,
you,

1000
01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:47.830
you shouldn't be dealing with them no more.
You know you shit.

1001
01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.900
That's not probably healthy relationship obsession.
You know what?
What?

1002
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.520
What caused the obsession?
I don't know.
Maybe like some people you can,

1003
01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.660
you just fucked the shit out of a charming dude.
You know what I'm saying?

1004
01:00:58.661 --> 01:01:01.750
With some piece of
shit.

1005
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:04.360
He girl you broke or dude,

1006
01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:09.510
you broke her phone when she was like waiting outside your dog like a dog.

1007
01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.220
Are you okay?
Okay.
You guys,

1008
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.730
she's like a bloodhound for you want something to eat?
You okay?
Okay.
Okay.

1009
01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:22.310
How long?
How many times did you have to fuck her before you broke her?

1010
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:28.060
What are you a case study from?
The first really the first session.

1011
01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:32.400
Now you a cancer game.
Okay.
Okay.

1012
01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:41.910
Charlie Murphy.
Oh,
you okay.
Breaking girls.
Wills.

1013
01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:46.920
I must caution Charlie did a Murphy.
Then I'm going to tell you something though,

1014
01:01:46.921 --> 01:01:49.940
man.
I'm tattoo.
Charlie did a really didn't emerge.

1015
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:54.570
Charlie did a movie that I thought was the same name as the coconut water,

1016
01:01:54.571 --> 01:01:59.510
isn't it?
Oh yes.
Cook out to Seel to see.
All right.
[inaudible] out too.

1017
01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:03.850
Yeah.
With Mike Tyson.
Mike Tyson is a scene in the movie.
Yeah.
Yeah,
too.

1018
01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.420
He's in it.
When's that coming out?

1019
01:02:06.421 --> 01:02:10.740
Cause that you guys from that last year or two years ago?
Two years ago.

1020
01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.810
What is it on Miami?
Yeah.
I don't,

1021
01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:15.820
I don't know where it's coming out because they,
that dude Jimmy Henchman,
he's,

1022
01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:16.530
you know.
Yeah.

1023
01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:18.990
That's what the shot Ken and I told him we was coming down in Miami.
He,

1024
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.100
he's going to do a screening.

1025
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:24.840
<v 4>Oh,
okay.
One of the producers got put away,
so I don't know.</v>

1026
01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:27.830
What's the wonderful other movies,
movies,

1027
01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.830
movies,
movies are finding me at my best.

1028
01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:35.490
My best friend was the fact that I had a chance to work with Mike.

1029
01:02:35.491 --> 01:02:38.910
I knew Mike Tyson before he was the champ.
You know what I'm saying?

1030
01:02:38.911 --> 01:02:43.911
So I seen that the whole journey from the guy who was irregular,

1031
01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:44.671
dude,

1032
01:02:44.671 --> 01:02:48.800
that was scared and you know all these people around them and tell him you could

1033
01:02:48.801 --> 01:02:53.330
do this.
And he did it and he became this bigger than life person all the way to,

1034
01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:57.000
you know,
to the end now the person that he is now,

1035
01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:00.120
because if you see Mike now,
Mike got his shit together.
You know what I'm saying?

1036
01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:03.510
He's not,
nobody could sell a,
he's outta control.
He's not out of control.

1037
01:03:03.511 --> 01:03:06.780
He's a married duty,
he's calm,
he's polite to people.

1038
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:11.660
He doesn't get in trouble no more.
He got to laughing the dude man.

1039
01:03:11.661 --> 01:03:15.630
Interesting.
Yeah,
he got his shit together now.
So I feel good about that.

1040
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.080
I got to work with them when that movie.
So that was a good feeling man.

1041
01:03:19.081 --> 01:03:23.700
Cause I hadn't seen him in years.
I seen him when I did see him,
he was back.

1042
01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:27.600
You know what I'm saying?
You've seen that documentary.
They,
I seen the document.

1043
01:03:27.601 --> 01:03:30.160
How fucking powerful was that with the purse strings?

1044
01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:32.880
We never seen that Tyson document.
Is it just called Tyson?

1045
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:38.910
When you see a man cry fucking and cried when he reflects on parts of his life.

1046
01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.950
Strong man like that.
You have to realize that whatever was on it was no joke.

1047
01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.470
Yeah,
it's an incredible,
that's a man who,

1048
01:03:46.471 --> 01:03:51.180
one time I went to his house and it was five or six limos and nobody would get

1049
01:03:51.181 --> 01:03:54.810
out the limo and I said,
I come to mind is getting out the car.
They said,
hey,

1050
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:57.330
you don't see that line standing over there.

1051
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.220
Mike tastes the lane and his front yard and says

1052
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.500
<v 5>like hangover starts.
The only man who's house avid went over.</v>

1053
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:08.160
There was a lane in the front yard loose.
Wow.

1054
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:10.530
He was on the steps like this heavyweight belt.

1055
01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:22.710
He was like,
oh no,
no.
That's not a cat.
That's a lion.
That's fucking real.

1056
01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:26.620
Make tastes a male or a female law.

1057
01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:31.140
So the main line in his front yard,
loose shit.
It was walking.

1058
01:04:31.141 --> 01:04:34.710
It was off the leash,
man.
He was not in a cake.
It was in the yard.

1059
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:39.090
Oh my God.
They came out and started wrestling with him in mind.

1060
01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.560
Jod Damn.
How big was the lion?
It was big man.

1061
01:04:43.561 --> 01:04:48.000
It was a lion man he was wrestling with and grabbed him and started tussling

1062
01:04:48.001 --> 01:04:51.380
with him and all the [inaudible] and everybody was in the limits cause the land

1063
01:04:51.381 --> 01:04:55.050
could come up to a limousine and busted window open and come in there.
I'm sorry.

1064
01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:55.620
Easy.

1065
01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:58.560
He could just go like get booth from come right in there and just having lunch.

1066
01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:01.520
So everybody was in the car.
You couldn't back out cause it was all like

1067
01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.860
<v 4>five limos.
Everybody's in the car herself.
Bad thinking.</v>

1068
01:05:04.861 --> 01:05:07.500
It makes us getting ready to be eaten by this land

1069
01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:11.190
<v 5>that isn't happy is he plays with him and he put takes him in the back.</v>

1070
01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:13.920
That comes back out and I was like,
you know what,

1071
01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:18.130
I'm never going to be in around another man in that's going to do

1072
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:18.963
<v 0>that.</v>

1073
01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:23.950
And you know what I'm saying cause to me he was it Mike Tyson.

1074
01:05:23.951 --> 01:05:26.830
Is that Elaine team?
You have everybody making working in Vegas?
No,

1075
01:05:26.831 --> 01:05:29.710
he's just the same lanes.
He had one in his front yard man.

1076
01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:35.320
But he had other cats there to Bieber would never have a lion and it'd be like

1077
01:05:35.321 --> 01:05:37.360
to chose all the way or something.
Boy,

1078
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:39.470
I can come and guide this waiting my mcats.

1079
01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:42.280
Isn't that cause we've seen wild kingdom land make.

1080
01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.270
We've seen him eat Willdabeast.

1081
01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:49.000
The Mike Tyson story is such a classic fucking story to him and goes from being

1082
01:05:49.001 --> 01:05:52.430
poor to being intensely rich.
Intentionally rich.

1083
01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:57.370
The focus of attention of literally every person on the planet when he was at

1084
01:05:57.371 --> 01:06:02.371
his peak pan and the late eighties when he beat Michael Spinks crazy.

1085
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.120
Jesus Christ.

1086
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:09.010
I don't even think people today when he ate a billboard and make ms faces made

1087
01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:13.530
an urn,
that billboard,
I don't remember that strongest billboard on sunset.

1088
01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:16.930
It's an,
it's an iron.
Mike did like his face was made.

1089
01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:20.890
An angel just makes face awesome.
Awesome.
Uh,

1090
01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:24.120
building the years like the Bruce Seldon years where Bruce Seldon,

1091
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:27.850
he didn't even like,
he missed him with a left talking cell.
Does knees buckle?

1092
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.200
He got up and just said,
what am I doing getting up?
You know what?

1093
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:35.770
I'm just knew better.
He knew all those guys who was a destroyer.

1094
01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:39.650
There's no fighter out there right now.
I think that is,

1095
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:44.050
we captured their attention since,
since him not like him,
not like him.
Since him.

1096
01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:44.831
People don't understand.

1097
01:06:44.831 --> 01:06:47.950
He was Michael [inaudible] who would be charism charismatic if he was American

1098
01:06:47.951 --> 01:06:51.240
pack yet.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I would be like that,
but if that,

1099
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.350
you know it's like that over he,
yeah.

1100
01:06:53.351 --> 01:06:57.070
If you look at the sheer numbers between the how he wasn't Tyson was,

1101
01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:00.930
he's probably right up there with Tyson right now.
Huh?
Close.
Close.

1102
01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:02.980
Not to say I definitely,

1103
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:06.760
especially in Asia.

1104
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:09.980
I mean he bought an la man.

1105
01:07:09.981 --> 01:07:14.320
Right now I'm in La and you got a wild card boxing where where he trains people

1106
01:07:14.321 --> 01:07:17.070
don't sit out there and wait for him.
They wait to find out what time man,

1107
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.360
he's going to be there.
It's like a whole crowd of people there.

1108
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:23.650
I did this thing with Daniel Tosh for Tasha is TV show where toss gets punched

1109
01:07:23.651 --> 01:07:27.700
in the head by a Manny Pacquiao.
He left honey pack.
Y'All punch him.

1110
01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:30.280
[inaudible] was very nice.
He's very nice.

1111
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:33.940
He's just like barely tapping them and we had to do it a little harder to make

1112
01:07:33.941 --> 01:07:37.150
it realistic so you can put a little pop into it,
but it was nothing.

1113
01:07:37.151 --> 01:07:38.020
It was very nice.

1114
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:43.120
But every business in that whole complex has Manny's pictures up and Manny sign

1115
01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.720
things and it's got boxing gloves on and pictures of him eating in this

1116
01:07:46.721 --> 01:07:50.080
restaurant that's right there and it's cool.
Yeah,
it's like there's a,

1117
01:07:50.081 --> 01:07:54.610
there's some,
he's huge.
He's like a super superstar and he's like,
he's a,

1118
01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.730
he deserves it.
Oh yeah.
And he's such a nice guy.

1119
01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.790
What do you think is doing women between a or teasing me?
That's a good question.

1120
01:08:00.791 --> 01:08:03.460
I was going to bring that up when we were talking about Tyson because I was

1121
01:08:03.461 --> 01:08:06.100
watching this thing on Victor Ortiz when he was talking about his childhood.

1122
01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:08.240
I was watching it right before we had the rover and he had a rough,

1123
01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:12.340
his mother when he was 12 years old or it's when he was seven years old or six

1124
01:08:12.341 --> 01:08:16.130
or seven.
His mother just left,
just took off,
never came back.
So

1125
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:19.670
<v 3>he's only raised by his dad and his dad just beat the shit out of them,</v>

1126
01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.170
hit them with sticks,
hit them with anything.

1127
01:08:21.171 --> 01:08:25.430
And then when they were 12 his dad left.
So it was him and his fucking brother,

1128
01:08:25.431 --> 01:08:30.380
like wild dogs at 12 years old taking care of themselves.
Scary shit man.

1129
01:08:30.381 --> 01:08:35.060
Like they,
they had,
they had nothing.
They had nothing.
Real fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1130
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:36.770
And you know,
to come from that man,

1131
01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.410
there's a certain amount of resolve that that kid's going to have that the

1132
01:08:39.411 --> 01:08:40.970
average person is not going to have,

1133
01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:44.880
but it's not going to be enough to deal with Floyd motherfucking Mayweather dude

1134
01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:48.800
cause flooding in,
whether it was an artist,
there's,
you know,

1135
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:53.300
love him or hate him for like his personality and the way he attracts fans and

1136
01:08:53.301 --> 01:08:57.820
the way,
you know,
gets flamboyant,
crazy skillfully.
Forget all that skillfully.

1137
01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:02.780
He's a fucking master boxer.
He's a master.
He's very rarely in any trouble.

1138
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.980
He gets hit.
He can take a shot.
Shane Mosley,
Bang,
shame on that button.

1139
01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:09.710
The division with it stop.
Well,

1140
01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:12.590
it wouldn't have been able to recover the way Mayweather did everything

1141
01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.110
appropriate to add them up.
He recovered,

1142
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:19.730
he took his time before he jumped back going.
And he was,
it was beautiful man.

1143
01:09:19.731 --> 01:09:24.470
He's just very,
very technical.
He's,
he's,
he's technically perfect.
Like he's,

1144
01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:29.060
he makes these little short movements and throws guys off little quarter turns

1145
01:09:29.061 --> 01:09:31.550
and shots from the,
from different angles that you expect.

1146
01:09:31.551 --> 01:09:33.230
And it gets through what your,
you know,

1147
01:09:33.231 --> 01:09:35.900
he finds out what you're going to step and then he's waiting for you before you

1148
01:09:35.901 --> 01:09:40.730
do it.
He sorts you out,
man.
He's a real,
he's a real technical boxer.

1149
01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:41.623
That's what I,

1150
01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:46.560
<v 4>I think what's going to happen with him or no teeth is going the distance it's</v>

1151
01:09:46.561 --> 01:09:49.120
going to be bloody and think so.
Yeah.
Or,

1152
01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:51.750
and that letting him beat him and he's coming to fight,
man.

1153
01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:54.610
He's going to have to get beat.
Yeah.
And uh,

1154
01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.730
Mayweather's it's going to be a good fight for me was,

1155
01:09:56.731 --> 01:09:57.960
I think Mayweather's going to win,

1156
01:09:57.961 --> 01:10:00.900
but he's going to have to be Mayweather to beat him.
It ain't gonna.

1157
01:10:00.901 --> 01:10:02.730
He ain't gonna be able to come in and have the night off.

1158
01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.560
That dude is the real deal.

1159
01:10:04.561 --> 01:10:09.220
I get perhaps he'd beat my friend Andre is a good friend of my Andre Berto.
Uh,

1160
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:11.370
and that was a great fight.
Great fight.

1161
01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:15.330
Woo showed me that this dude is no joke,

1162
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.490
<v 3>no Joe Andre Berto,
that's shatty dropped him with anybody else.
Don't get up.</v>

1163
01:10:20.150 --> 01:10:24.050
That guy got back up and then put him down off of that.

1164
01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:28.850
So when I put you down,
I wasn't even at 100%.
I'm drunk when I do that.

1165
01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:33.920
<v 4>Well and not so many fantasy pull that trigger be on the ground like Danny.</v>

1166
01:10:33.921 --> 01:10:34.080
Right.
I didn't

1167
01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.660
<v 3>get up and put the other guy down.
How often do you see that happen?
He's uh,</v>

1168
01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:40.770
he's definitely a a blood and guts type fighter.
You know,

1169
01:10:40.771 --> 01:10:45.180
he tells himself in a dangerous going to be a good feeling that one fight where

1170
01:10:45.181 --> 01:10:49.860
he quit.
And ever since that one fight,
he felt terrible about that.

1171
01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:53.700
He was losing his fight and he got dropped and he just call the referee off and

1172
01:10:53.701 --> 01:10:57.630
quit.
And people really heavily criticized his heart.

1173
01:10:58.050 --> 01:11:03.050
But what it was was he wasn't a hundred percent focused on either his training

1174
01:11:03.361 --> 01:11:07.770
or fighting itself or the consequences of losing or whatever the fuck it was.

1175
01:11:07.771 --> 01:11:10.980
He came into a fight out of shape and shit.

1176
01:11:10.981 --> 01:11:14.160
That happens and some shit that young guys will do,
they'll,
they'll,

1177
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:17.490
they'll fuck up and they'll have a bad camp or they needed to learn something or

1178
01:11:17.491 --> 01:11:20.910
they needed to be pushed and broken to rebuild and come back again.

1179
01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:24.510
So ever since that fight,
he's been a fucking monster.

1180
01:11:24.511 --> 01:11:26.580
That Murdo fight was insane.

1181
01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.270
I thought Berto was like the next challenger to Mayweather.
I say like,

1182
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.340
this guy is so tactical of a Berto is as well.
Berlin is a sniper.

1183
01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:38.010
<v 0>September 30th freaking went up.
He's a real accurate puncher too.</v>

1184
01:11:38.011 --> 01:11:41.760
That guy's a sniper.
He's,
yeah,
he's,
he's a bad motherfucker.

1185
01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:44.310
I thought he was going to be the next time when on warranties beat him.
I was,

1186
01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.790
I was blown away.
I kids Tov and he's got,
he got a lot better.

1187
01:11:47.791 --> 01:11:49.140
You've got a lot better from that one fight.

1188
01:11:49.141 --> 01:11:53.160
You could tell the one fight where he quit from then on his dedication is

1189
01:11:53.161 --> 01:11:57.540
obviously been way,
way more foot.
Waist.
Yeah.
Cause now he's,

1190
01:11:57.750 --> 01:12:00.630
the way he wanted it was the way he will be Berto.

1191
01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:04.000
What that does for your confidence.
Yeah,
that's,

1192
01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.690
that's it's going to be what much more than if he just came in,

1193
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:11.820
stopped them early is that he had a grueling contest with these men came out on

1194
01:12:11.821 --> 01:12:15.600
top,
you know,
so that they really just a laugh.
Forget what you,

1195
01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:17.730
do you think that there's any way that may,

1196
01:12:17.731 --> 01:12:20.790
whether it was going to be rusting because he keeps taking these like year and a

1197
01:12:20.791 --> 01:12:23.520
half breaks,
two year breaks in between fights.

1198
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:26.580
Well I think the reason why he's doing that,
it's because his hands,

1199
01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:30.840
you know what I'm saying?
That's his hands in a good,
good time between five to,

1200
01:12:30.841 --> 01:12:33.910
he'll have,
he's a holder,
you know what I'm saying?
They break really isn't right.

1201
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:38.060
His broken up my sheet lab,
sometimes hands.
So he's preserving his hands.
Yeah,

1202
01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:41.670
he's,
but he's still trains clicking a dagger doggies around the clock.

1203
01:12:41.671 --> 01:12:42.504
He's training,

1204
01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.750
you know whether he's got a fight coming up in a nice his lifestyle.

1205
01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:50.550
So I don't think he's rusty at.
So you think he's just constantly stairs?

1206
01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:54.250
They bring them in.
He whips guys answers every week man.

1207
01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:58.650
Whether you get it framed coming up and that really?
Yeah.
The guys come on,

1208
01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:03.240
I'm going to the Gym,
light him up.
He works out.
He's always in shape.

1209
01:13:03.241 --> 01:13:06.270
He doesn't get,
he doesn't get in shape during camp.

1210
01:13:06.271 --> 01:13:10.350
He's already in shape when he gets there,
you know,
just showed us everything.

1211
01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.750
They showed his training camp to show him hitting the pads.

1212
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:17.360
<v 3>It's ridiculous man.
Nobody had some has like he does too.</v>

1213
01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.370
And a lot of it is this type of puppet.
The puppet just combinations pipped up,

1214
01:13:22.371 --> 01:13:26.280
up,
up,
up,
up,
up,
up,
up,
up.
So he just wants the fucking combination.

1215
01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:29.960
Since the zone get tired,
these are just relaxed and everything's flowing.

1216
01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:36.390
Yeah.
Was ridiculous.
Routine is insane.

1217
01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:41.070
Well he's a master and he doesn't does it from a standing position.

1218
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.100
Yeah.
He doesn't take much punishment,
man.
He's a guy.

1219
01:13:44.101 --> 01:13:47.290
He's been a boxer for a long time and he looks perfect.
Lucid,

1220
01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:50.100
nothing wrong with him.
He's got no scars,
not busted up.

1221
01:13:50.101 --> 01:13:51.390
And what does that Mike Tyson,

1222
01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:55.170
Mike Tyson with his line just wrestling around with it and stuff like that in

1223
01:13:55.171 --> 01:14:00.110
the video.
I didn't make that a 19 year old,
20 year old Mike Tyson right there.

1224
01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.350
This right here.
Pass the Mike Tyson and foster a tag.
My God,

1225
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:06.660
he's got a fucking tiger.

1226
01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:10.730
<v 0>He has a line to the beginning,
but he had one them.
Oh my.</v>

1227
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.750
<v 3>How could that end?
Well,</v>

1228
01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:19.500
<v 5>yeah,
it doesn't end well.
If you eat them long enough,
it doesn't anywhere.</v>

1229
01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:23.070
They always kill it.
Right?
Eventually.
Yeah.
Come on man.
They can make a mistake.

1230
01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.210
They might not even do it on purpose.
Joe Kill you by accident.
Yeah,

1231
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.500
but he's not what happened to take freedom,
Roy,
he didn't get placed.
You and kid,

1232
01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:31.780
the Siegfried and Roy,

1233
01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:36.780
that guy got killed like one little took off side of his face.

1234
01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:38.080
Well,
he didn't he

1235
01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:42.370
<v 3>die,
right?
He,
um,
he got just got really badly wounded.
And what happened was the,</v>

1236
01:14:42.371 --> 01:14:42.940
the uh,

1237
01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:46.930
they think that the tiger got confused because a woman had feathers in her hair,

1238
01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:49.990
like some crazy peacock feathers and they think that it's higher amount of

1239
01:14:49.991 --> 01:14:53.800
freaked out and thought that was an animal.
So grabbed him to rescue him,

1240
01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:56.470
<v 5>to pull him away from that.
You got Joan Rivers.</v>

1241
01:14:57.050 --> 01:15:00.720
So the tiger lifted that feather thing and thought that was one of those fucking

1242
01:15:00.721 --> 01:15:05.310
beats from Avatar.
Sunbelt was just going to pop out of the audience.

1243
01:15:05.311 --> 01:15:06.870
Who in the hell is dead wrong?

1244
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.050
A manatee to can grabbed him by his neck and just drag it

1245
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:13.710
<v 3>them off?
Jesus Christ.
Why?</v>

1246
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:17.180
What does that feel like when you hear your bones and your neck snapping and

1247
01:15:17.181 --> 01:15:21.380
cracklin inside the mall of this enormous beast?

1248
01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:25.370
At that point,
your brain is saying this was a tiger,

1249
01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:30.710
<v 5>right?
We're in here with you.
Right?
That's what it's just reality is</v>

1250
01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:37.490
what the fuck was I thinking?
Right,
right.
Yeah.

1251
01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:40.610
<v 3>It's hard for us to really wrap our heads around the fact that shit like that</v>

1252
01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:43.560
really exists.
The Tigers and bears.

1253
01:15:43.561 --> 01:15:46.650
And did you hear about that lady in Russia that got eaten by a bear while she

1254
01:15:46.651 --> 01:15:49.320
was calling her mother on the phone?
What?

1255
01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:52.800
The fucking bears don't kill you man.
They just start eating you.

1256
01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.710
That's one of the things about maritime house and started eating it.
No,

1257
01:15:55.711 --> 01:15:56.544
they were hiking.

1258
01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:00.600
Her and her stepfather were hiking and then killed her stepfather first and she

1259
01:16:00.601 --> 01:16:03.600
got to her cell phone and she's calling the cell phone.

1260
01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:07.170
She's calling her mother while this fucking bear is eating her leg.

1261
01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:12.030
The bears eating her leg and she's screaming and screaming in the phone calls.

1262
01:16:12.031 --> 01:16:15.600
She called her like three times over a period of an hour.
Well,

1263
01:16:15.601 --> 01:16:17.220
this bear was eating her alive.

1264
01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:23.320
<v 5>Where was this?
Internet comes in Russia.
Can you hear the audio online?</v>

1265
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:25.190
Bryan Park.

1266
01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:29.470
It was a woman as a woman and she was caught.

1267
01:16:29.471 --> 01:16:33.730
She kept calling her mother while she was being eaten and I thought,
no,
no,

1268
01:16:33.731 --> 01:16:36.700
there's no audio clip.
That'd be the worst audio cleo.
But they found,
yeah,

1269
01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:39.790
<v 3>they found the body.
They found that dude dead.
And,
uh,
he,</v>

1270
01:16:39.791 --> 01:16:43.500
the bear was eating the guy when they got there and the girl had been what?

1271
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:45.400
She died from her injuries.
What was it?

1272
01:16:45.401 --> 01:16:48.410
A Russian black bear and grizzly bear rushing Christie.

1273
01:16:48.490 --> 01:16:51.050
I believe it was because I think that's what the,

1274
01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:53.560
the article I said that I wrote the side.

1275
01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:55.560
But you know any kind of bare from Kelly yet.

1276
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:58.950
<v 5>How sad is people will be going up in these areas with that's positive one.
No,</v>

1277
01:16:59.010 --> 01:17:01.780
we haven't gotten what she,
you know what I mean?
Well you didn't get have a gun.

1278
01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:04.370
I didn't have a really big one.
You got a better,
a really big one.

1279
01:17:04.371 --> 01:17:07.620
If you see a grizzly bear with a regular gun might not be good enough in his

1280
01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:10.040
mouth.
Might be good enough.
So even if

1281
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.110
<v 0>you bagged me,
I'm blowing your teeth out.
Yeah,</v>

1282
01:17:12.111 --> 01:17:16.200
maybe rang me up that full stiff in your mouth.
What about a Koala blow?

1283
01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.200
The roof of your mouth.
The is a vicious,

1284
01:17:18.201 --> 01:17:21.150
if you're a female Koala beat the crap out of me.

1285
01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.860
You fuck up a Koala Bass is what is this a fat cat?

1286
01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:30.470
Well,
we got shop clause.
Here's the move a Koala bears on the move.

1287
01:17:30.471 --> 01:17:33.860
He's headed towards you.
What's your first step?
Chicken and drop kicking him.

1288
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:38.300
Drop kicking like a photocopy pun.
Tell me a short prompt.
Him.

1289
01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:42.220
You'd have to kick him right into running into a look eucalyptus.

1290
01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:43.460
You got to hope that he doesn't.

1291
01:17:43.461 --> 01:17:47.750
Somehow another time you lifting the foot up and just run right up your pants

1292
01:17:47.751 --> 01:17:52.751
and your deck as you go to swing you just a little off timing.

1293
01:17:52.761 --> 01:17:55.790
Any stories up your leg and Joe White on your Dick.

1294
01:17:57.410 --> 01:18:02.160
Cause they only eat eucalyptus.
That's it.
That's all the,
yeah,
don't take,

1295
01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:06.340
I believe Koala bears raped the fuck out of female qualifiers.
Oh,

1296
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:08.330
so they have to be strong and they have to have a good bite.

1297
01:18:08.331 --> 01:18:12.810
If they can pull that off,
I might've made that up.
And for the boss,
I know.

1298
01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.000
Devil,
they're rapists.
They're not real.

1299
01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:22.490
That's a real answer.
Did exist.
It's a real animal.
Yeah it does.

1300
01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:26.440
I'm thinking the Tasmanian Tiger,
Tasmanian Tiger did exist.
It was in uh,

1301
01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:30.440
Australia,
but they went extinct.
But the Tasmanian devil was a real animal.
It is.

1302
01:18:30.441 --> 01:18:34.450
It is.
It looks like a little rat family type thing,
but yeah,

1303
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:40.010
they raped,
they raped the female body,
but rape man,

1304
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:41.720
half of their body is,

1305
01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:46.810
is I think like a little bit over half of their body is jaw muscle.

1306
01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:49.640
God Damn there.
Their whole,

1307
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:54.910
they're just basically a mouth walking around and they fight from birth until

1308
01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:56.210
death.
Yeah.

1309
01:18:56.220 --> 01:19:00.320
They fight any other Tasmanian invite when they're born constantly.

1310
01:19:00.321 --> 01:19:03.110
How big are they?
They're,
they're big now.

1311
01:19:03.111 --> 01:19:07.100
That's something that would like get ahold of your foot when you try to kick in.

1312
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:11.480
Yeah.
You wouldn't want to kick this ugly man.
Oh my God.

1313
01:19:11.481 --> 01:19:15.530
Look at the images this motherfucker and they yell totally shit.

1314
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:21.140
That's like a crazy cartoon pedo bare face.
Like vampire bears.

1315
01:19:21.141 --> 01:19:25.520
Look at this thing or this thing.
Thank rat bears,
right man.
Look at that thing.

1316
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:29.740
Wow.
They will fuck you up to very no jokes,

1317
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:35.900
dad.
You shouldn't be angry.
That's when I game.
Yeah,
those little,

1318
01:19:35.901 --> 01:19:40.640
there's like a few of these little type of crazy animals that scared the shit

1319
01:19:40.641 --> 01:19:41.210
out of me.

1320
01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:45.410
You know of different species like wolverines and like honey badgers and shit

1321
01:19:45.411 --> 01:19:49.160
like that.
They scare the fuck out of me man,
because they're only,

1322
01:19:49.161 --> 01:19:53.450
they might only be like 15,
20 pounds,
but they'll kill you.
Most gravity man,

1323
01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:57.580
they're like to sting rays of the forest.
They'll kill you.

1324
01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:01.820
A honey badger would kill a person.
It just would need some time.
Yeah.

1325
01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:06.530
I've never heard of a honeybadger talking about talking about them to hit one

1326
01:20:06.531 --> 01:20:07.890
sentence,
but then

1327
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:12.930
<v 5>you watch these uh,
these shows by dogs,
different breeds of dogs.</v>

1328
01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:17.190
There's a,
it's a Badgett honeybadger you're talking about.

1329
01:20:17.191 --> 01:20:21.790
There's a terrier who specializes in him and killing the honeybadger.

1330
01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:26.040
They come with like 30 of these dogs.
He may kill like the first five.
Jesus,

1331
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:27.450
Feisty.
When they come,

1332
01:20:27.451 --> 01:20:31.320
they go into his dad and they go in there and bringing out God

1333
01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:40.350
then and bring him out Dell terriers and though he may kill like the first four

1334
01:20:40.351 --> 01:20:41.430
or five to come in there.

1335
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:47.120
The other ones then that affected by the death of the reds and he's coming home.

1336
01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.130
He's like a real live Bruce Lee honeybadger.

1337
01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:54.870
All the songs are coming in and he's just fucking them up left and right.

1338
01:20:55.170 --> 01:20:57.240
Taking them out some and they drag him out and show the them.

1339
01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:01.950
They labeled and drag them out.
It says the most fearless animal on earth,

1340
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:07.380
they said about the honey badger don't give a fuck.
And the police videos

1341
01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:11.050
<v 0>the online that say honey badgers doesn't give a fuck.</v>

1342
01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:15.460
And it's like all these videos of honey badgers eaten cobras are chasing dumb.

1343
01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:18.100
Anything that's in front of them,
they kill poisons stinks all day.

1344
01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:21.400
They just too fast.
They just sneak up behind the snake,
bite him in the head,

1345
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:23.080
and sometimes they get bit,

1346
01:21:23.081 --> 01:21:25.210
they get hidden by the venom and you know what happens?

1347
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:28.390
They fall asleep and they wake up an hour later and then they eat the snake

1348
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:29.760
though he's going to kill me.

1349
01:21:29.770 --> 01:21:34.770
Blacked out from venom and these little crazy murderers body processed the venom

1350
01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:38.380
and he got up like he was drunk and you start eating that snake again,

1351
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:41.500
snake bit him with its poison and the poisoned didn't do ship and make them take

1352
01:21:41.501 --> 01:21:45.190
a fucking nap.
Wow,
honey badgers must be from Brooklyn.

1353
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.730
I can just imagine if they could talk,
they'd have a Brooklyn accent.

1354
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:52.080
Honey badges don't even speak,
Bro.
There's no need for language and their thumb.

1355
01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:52.953
They're thinking,

1356
01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:56.020
they're thinking that there's no variables and they're thinking you don't need

1357
01:21:56.021 --> 01:21:59.320
language.
Fuck kill sleep.

1358
01:21:59.350 --> 01:22:02.860
That's what the honeybadger for.
Wake up.
Do it again.

1359
01:22:02.861 --> 01:22:04.240
Just realize how weak we are.

1360
01:22:04.241 --> 01:22:09.241
Man was so flashy and too like just nothing to see planet of the apes.

1361
01:22:09.710 --> 01:22:14.040
I see.
Did you like it and laughed?

1362
01:22:14.170 --> 01:22:15.790
He laughed.
It was funny.

1363
01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.070
<v 5>I went to see planet of the apes cause I was like,</v>

1364
01:22:19.071 --> 01:22:20.700
I know it's going to be some material.

1365
01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.270
<v 0>I loved it.
I love the guests.</v>

1366
01:22:24.271 --> 01:22:29.250
Can see when he came home,
when he left the girl out,

1367
01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.320
what it was like prison stuff

1368
01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.510
<v 5>wasn't me.
It was a monkey doing the Levi's,
uh,</v>

1369
01:22:34.890 --> 01:22:38.930
James Commercial at the end of the movie though when it was last very last scene

1370
01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:42.780
and he was standing on the branch overlooking San Francisco.
That pose he had,

1371
01:22:42.781 --> 01:22:45.810
it was like,
that's not a chimp pros man.
I said,
man,

1372
01:22:45.811 --> 01:22:50.130
suppose to say he's selling some jeans or shirts,

1373
01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:52.260
doctors or something.
You know what he was doing?
He was standing there,

1374
01:22:52.261 --> 01:22:54.690
he had his hand up,
he was looking gay dads

1375
01:22:56.580 --> 01:23:00.120
looking at the Golden Gate Bridge and all that.
I was like,
Nigga,
this shit man.

1376
01:23:00.121 --> 01:23:00.954
It's true.

1377
01:23:02.130 --> 01:23:05.380
<v 0>It was weird when it sexy,
sexy money.</v>

1378
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:11.110
<v 2>Yes,
your monkey moves man.
That was the whole thing.</v>

1379
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:13.020
He was,
but he wasn't.

1380
01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:17.030
<v 3>But he was a supercharged super monkey man.
He was a monkey smartest people.</v>

1381
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:21.830
He was an alien and like,
yeah,
he was.
I just,
I'm down for any movie with Champs.

1382
01:23:21.831 --> 01:23:25.610
Fuck people up.
I love watching chimps.
I love the way they move,
man.

1383
01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:27.920
It's fucking shocking.
When you,

1384
01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.380
you ever watched any of those things where they would teach chimps,

1385
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:34.880
had a sign their own names and they can teach them how to spell things and that

1386
01:23:34.881 --> 01:23:37.070
when there would a spell it correctly,
they would get candy.

1387
01:23:37.071 --> 01:23:40.870
So they learn how to spell certain things and point certain things out.
And,
uh,

1388
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:41.691
this one chimp,

1389
01:23:41.691 --> 01:23:44.420
they would let him into the cage and the first thing they have to do is

1390
01:23:44.421 --> 01:23:46.970
establish dominance.
So as soon as you open this thing up,

1391
01:23:46.971 --> 01:23:50.240
he's a big fucking fully grown,
like eight year old male.

1392
01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:54.680
So he comes in and just starts fucking throwing himself through the air.

1393
01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:57.380
He's like a buck 60,
a buck 70,

1394
01:23:57.381 --> 01:24:01.070
just hurls himself through the kitchens,
the cage,

1395
01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:05.750
the cage back and forth.
Hurls himself through the Kachin bars.

1396
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:10.790
And you just look at the strength that he displays and you watch it happen.

1397
01:24:10.791 --> 01:24:11.140
You,

1398
01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:15.200
you watch him throw his body around and we're just realize what he could do to

1399
01:24:15.201 --> 01:24:16.840
you.
And then he sits

1400
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:20.490
<v 2>down and then a play with you.
And then it was like,
you know,</v>

1401
01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:22.960
you put this things out,
it takes his candy,
eats it,

1402
01:24:24.370 --> 01:24:27.430
but he just wants to let you know what the fuck he could do.
No,

1403
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:32.410
like he's some flowers or candy or whatever.

1404
01:24:32.411 --> 01:24:34.570
I could come over there and just smack you around.

1405
01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:37.600
I thought planet of the apes was good.
I didn't think it was that funny.

1406
01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.720
I thought I liked it.

1407
01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:46.090
I liked that gas can come on.
It was pretty funny.
Not the gorilla,

1408
01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:49.650
the gorilla.
He knew he was smart.
He looked a bit loud.

1409
01:24:50.010 --> 01:24:50.730
<v 5>Oh,
right there.</v>

1410
01:24:50.730 --> 01:24:54.690
Isn't it funny or final destination that knew I movie has the best three d yet

1411
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.470
the seeing that stupid movie three d read.

1412
01:24:57.610 --> 01:25:00.180
I do not want to see him move or as a bunch of people just dying.

1413
01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:02.880
What's creative thought it with that movie?
Yeah.

1414
01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.470
Did you ever see the old ones though?

1415
01:25:04.471 --> 01:25:06.940
Like like that not highway scene where the semis are gone.

1416
01:25:06.941 --> 01:25:10.950
Like I can like just crazy car accident.
It's pretty cool.

1417
01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:14.820
Fucking awesome movie,
but it's a fun movie I guess.
MMM.

1418
01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.640
<v 2>No,
no,
no,
no.
I don't have that kind of free time to show a thousand ways to die.</v>

1419
01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:23.460
<v 3>It's now why?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That shows kind of funny.
I was just funny.</v>

1420
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:27.090
It was hilarious.
The problem with his final destination movies to me,
he's like,

1421
01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:31.080
oh,
he is,
he's getting acupuncture.
How's it going to be?
Oh,
now he's dead.

1422
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:34.410
I respect the special effects,
but other than that,
it's like,

1423
01:25:34.411 --> 01:25:36.070
what am just watching a bunch of people died.

1424
01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:39.930
<v 5>Curse.
This new one has a bridge that's collapsing.</v>

1425
01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:43.560
It's broken in the middle and it's during rush hour and he's just like,

1426
01:25:43.561 --> 01:25:48.420
the car is skidding and he was just in three.
Wow.
So that part's cool.
I'm sure.

1427
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:50.500
But you haven't seen it.
That's what I've been told.

1428
01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:54.870
I was saying it's like awesome.
Three d if you liked that shit.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.

1429
01:25:54.871 --> 01:25:56.450
I'm not into movies just for three days.

1430
01:25:56.451 --> 01:26:00.380
I saw Conan and it wasn't three d didn't know was that the no,

1431
01:26:00.570 --> 01:26:04.060
it sucks and awesome.
And it's

1432
01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:07.580
<v 3>talks at the same time because here's the deal.
The dude is the perfect Conan,</v>

1433
01:26:07.581 --> 01:26:08.960
like physically the way he looks.

1434
01:26:08.961 --> 01:26:12.410
He looks just like Conan and me could easily be Conan like right out of the

1435
01:26:12.411 --> 01:26:16.070
robbery.
Howard books.
So you got that and then you got,

1436
01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:18.950
did you hear my kids screaming in the background?
I need a studio.

1437
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.290
This is ridiculous.
We've got that echo.
Throw some man shit down.

1438
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:32.420
Anyway,
the dude was just kidding folks.
Don't get crazy out there.

1439
01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:37.580
Um,
the,
uh,
the books,
uh,
where it was,
it was,
but it had no story.

1440
01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:40.910
It was like the,
it was like,
it was awesome in the beginning when he was a kid,

1441
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:43.640
he was a bad ass kid killing everybody and it was awesome.

1442
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:46.610
And then it got lame and then it got awesome again.
It was a couple of fights.

1443
01:26:46.611 --> 01:26:50.210
It was pretty awesome.
And then it got lame again.
It was like awesome.
And Lane.

1444
01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.700
But they needed somebody while they were making that movie to be in the room

1445
01:26:52.701 --> 01:26:54.290
with them going,
what,
what

1446
01:26:54.450 --> 01:26:57.660
<v 5>you're going to do?
What?
No,
no.
They need a company that does that.</v>

1447
01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:00.570
I want really the,
I want to be that company.

1448
01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:07.050
That's a dumb,
why would you ever do that?
You know,
this is so fake.
Konijn oh,

1449
01:27:07.051 --> 01:27:07.500
neat.

1450
01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:12.500
<v 3>A three day weekend and a lot of weed and some buddies that like those kind of</v>

1451
01:27:13.191 --> 01:27:16.010
movies and you can fucking figure that out and you could figure out a way to,

1452
01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:25.070
that was the other problem.
This dude sounded way to California.
He was like,

1453
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:27.560
there was times like in deep battle,

1454
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:31.760
he was a great Conan when he was fighting things and killing and yelling and

1455
01:27:31.761 --> 01:27:34.730
screaming.
He's a great that,
but then he was sitting down and talking.

1456
01:27:34.731 --> 01:27:35.570
It was like,
all right dude,

1457
01:27:35.571 --> 01:27:37.580
you need to work on your Coney on voice cause this shit.

1458
01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:40.420
You just sound like some dude.
I would meet at target.
You know?

1459
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:43.640
It doesn't sound like someone who came from that era at all.

1460
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:50.390
<v 5>Okay,
thanks for crashing me back into reality and is honest.</v>

1461
01:27:50.410 --> 01:27:52.400
Wasn't any point blank.
Yeah,
exactly.

1462
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:57.200
Sounds like it's going to be hard to beat that man.

1463
01:27:57.201 --> 01:27:59.490
He did performance he put down was captured.

1464
01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:04.480
<v 3>Well he showed a certain intensity,
you know,
I mean Arnold had,
first of all,</v>

1465
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:06.850
nobody is built like Arnold and the,

1466
01:28:06.970 --> 01:28:09.970
they're all going to look weak compared to how he looked when he was flying

1467
01:28:09.971 --> 01:28:12.010
around the sword.
You know,
you just don't,

1468
01:28:12.011 --> 01:28:13.600
you don't get a dude is built like that.

1469
01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:18.140
<v 5>So I wouldn't see a remake with him now with you now he spent like a good hour</v>

1470
01:28:18.141 --> 01:28:21.260
prep for it and the hour prep.
Yeah.
Army.

1471
01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.370
We went back to the gym.
You probably could pull it off.

1472
01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:29.720
<v 3>Pull off that last rocky.
I mean,
uh,
I'm Sylvester Stallone.
Messes alone.</v>

1473
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:33.210
Pull that leg.
Never really let himself go.

1474
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:37.440
Arnold is clearly let himself go this pictures and he had a heart problem too,

1475
01:28:37.441 --> 01:28:40.290
right?
Did he have a heart?
Turkey?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1476
01:28:40.291 --> 01:28:41.790
He probably can't juice up anymore.

1477
01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.880
<v 5>The next movie's going to make is Mrs Doubtfire</v>

1478
01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:51.530
lessors to loans.
You may swaths,

1479
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:56.130
namely how many by at the way?

1480
01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.180
I can see my kids.

1481
01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:02.280
<v 3>He's a fascinating guy and wow.
Wow.
Just bangs is,
it's just shooting Lowe's</v>

1482
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:06.450
<v 0>and it was made while he's the mayor or governor rather head for 10 years.
Right.</v>

1483
01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:13.090
He's just too raw.
But Decade of this is be quiet about this is,

1484
01:29:13.091 --> 01:29:17.670
is it called
banging her all day

1485
01:29:19.670 --> 01:29:21.810
long hill.
The governor loves you.

1486
01:29:25.630 --> 01:29:29.760
So weird,
man.
We imagine that poor kid has to grow up knowing that,
you know,

1487
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:33.510
the governor was just banging his mom and he had a real dad that he grew up
with,

1488
01:29:33.511 --> 01:29:36.480
but it wasn't really his dad.
They looked just like Arnold.

1489
01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:38.880
That's gotta be a mind fuck and a half man.

1490
01:29:39.230 --> 01:29:42.850
But she getting the bodybuilding figure management,
you've got the same genes,

1491
01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:46.220
man.
Go hard.
Who Your father is,

1492
01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:50.160
get get down and goes to jail because he has a different mother.
He goes,

1493
01:29:50.161 --> 01:29:54.540
he's not entitled to all that cash.
It's totally different situation.
Right?

1494
01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:58.300
He gets sick.
He gets taken care of.
Yeah.
Well she has to.
Yeah,

1495
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:59.670
he has to pay child support,

1496
01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:03.180
but I bet the kids probably not in the will and all that good stuff.

1497
01:30:03.450 --> 01:30:07.440
Oh yes he is.
You can get in the wheelchair.
It was one of his offspring,
man.

1498
01:30:08.230 --> 01:30:11.250
This point,
that kid can look at it as half empty or half full.

1499
01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:17.040
You're halfway in.
Their kid can't win halfway in there.

1500
01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.860
You can make it work.
So that's what I'm thing,
man.

1501
01:30:19.861 --> 01:30:22.380
I wonder how many kids Kennedy had on the side and nobody knew about them,

1502
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:26.700
but 70 cent.
Now think about back in those days,
man,

1503
01:30:26.701 --> 01:30:28.110
they didn't have as many abortions.

1504
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.600
They were just a woman would go live with her mom.

1505
01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:35.330
I'm going to live in Rochester,
Rochester,

1506
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:41.010
Rochester.
That's when you know this fucking podcast has fallen off.

1507
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:46.780
We can't even come up with a good comedy name for whether it's checks 11
we were,

1508
01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:51.720
we peaked with the,
the honeybadger and that was at the honeybadger.

1509
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:55.500
Charlie's checking his Twitter.
We're all falling asleep.
No I'm not.

1510
01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:57.390
I'm just making sure that that Trump,

1511
01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:03.270
listen,
I would go into that.
What's the name of the club?

1512
01:31:03.271 --> 01:31:07.440
We're going to hit 1616 what's that?

1513
01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:08.610
It's a club in downtown.

1514
01:31:08.611 --> 01:31:13.440
I'm like that's going to hit that 1616 doing comedy tonight street.

1515
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:16.590
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's where you're doing it at this place.
You ever go down there?

1516
01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:20.490
That's when I started talking about it earlier,
but we got off the subject.

1517
01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:23.370
I was talking about how you going when,
I mean we are here for six weeks,

1518
01:31:23.371 --> 01:31:27.750
so that's why every week we'd go do the laugh factory knew going,

1519
01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:31.320
getting ready to go downtown.
I don't just sit back and go,
okay,

1520
01:31:31.321 --> 01:31:33.810
I'm doing a TV show on making money.
Uh,

1521
01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:38.400
Al do comedy when it's over because I know that the county's is going to suffer.

1522
01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:42.800
What I'm saying.
You take eight weeks off and don't do no stand up.

1523
01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:46.080
No Way.
When you go back eight weeks later,

1524
01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:49.170
your next show is going to be as good as your last one.
You know what I mean?

1525
01:31:49.171 --> 01:31:52.050
True.
There's no way it's going to be,
you know,
you got to get it back,

1526
01:31:52.051 --> 01:31:55.200
get all your feet back up under you again and so to

1527
01:31:56.730 --> 01:32:00.240
take you to get your feedback on.
Yeah.
One

1528
01:32:00.810 --> 01:32:05.170
<v 4>takes one,
one,
one,
one good one.
If I stay off off the stage for like two weeks,</v>

1529
01:32:05.171 --> 01:32:09.070
I never hardly stayed or more than two weeks so I took a month off once.

1530
01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:12.250
That was the longest ever took off.
It's a weird feeling,
right?
It's weird.

1531
01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:16.530
You feel hard for atlas man.
In fact,
I went last night and we went,

1532
01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:17.830
I went on at the laugh factory.

1533
01:32:17.831 --> 01:32:21.520
That was the first time for me in three weeks and I told him on the way down and

1534
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:22.480
I was like,
Yo man,

1535
01:32:24.610 --> 01:32:27.840
I can't believe how much anxiety as fear right now.
I feel like,

1536
01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:29.810
like I'm really scared right now.
Like,

1537
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:32.380
like I'm feeling like I might get down there and go,
I'm not going up.

1538
01:32:33.250 --> 01:32:36.550
You know what I'm saying?
But I of course I went up,
but that feeling was,

1539
01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:40.240
was their man for just snap going up,
you know,
for three weeks,
man,

1540
01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:44.690
that's the number one enemy of comedy,
you know,
worry that worries.

1541
01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:47.150
They're worried,
you know,
especially if you go on,
when we went,

1542
01:32:47.250 --> 01:32:50.680
when we went to the last fat laugh factory,
the week before that scene,

1543
01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:53.850
three dynamic guys come in and blow it up,
you know,

1544
01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:57.490
and that I was taking that week off.
So when I came back the next week,
I'm like,

1545
01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.510
you're going up.

1546
01:32:58.511 --> 01:33:02.830
But you seem to dudes that come through here it is that no slouches in here,
man.

1547
01:33:02.831 --> 01:33:04.570
You know what I'm saying?
For the most part,

1548
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:06.730
you don't want to come up with the big,

1549
01:33:07.290 --> 01:33:08.380
<v 2>it's Charlie Marino</v>

1550
01:33:09.410 --> 01:33:13.940
<v 4>and then you know you ain't,
you ain't,
you worry about that a lot.</v>

1551
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:19.850
Yeah,
definitely.
So that's especially coming into the game late with a very,

1552
01:33:19.851 --> 01:33:24.140
very famous brother too.
So I don't want nobody to come say,
oh,

1553
01:33:24.141 --> 01:33:27.420
when I seen him and he was,
he was nothing,
you know,

1554
01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:32.450
I want you to say I seen him and he,
you know,
dudes,
it's working at his craft.

1555
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:36.920
He's going hard at it.
I could see the work he puts in it and he's funny.

1556
01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:41.360
So the only way I can try to,
you know,
have any plane and put the work in,

1557
01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:44.900
I can't force you to like me,
but I could work hard,
you know?

1558
01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:48.530
But you're enjoying it too,
right.
I'm loving it,
man.
I'm loving it.

1559
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:53.150
I'm loving it.
And being a part of the community of comedians and everything,

1560
01:33:53.151 --> 01:33:56.900
the whole experience,
you know,
it's uh,
it's great,
you know,

1561
01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:00.550
that is a big part of it.
And the community people that should meet,
you know,

1562
01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:05.840
in my opinion,
there are no dumb comedians,
you know,
to be a community,

1563
01:34:05.850 --> 01:34:09.560
you got to have a certain level of intelligence is very few communities that I

1564
01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:12.910
would go,
that's a dumb guy.
You know,
pretty smart people that should meet,

1565
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:17.270
you know,
and they,
we'll look at things as interesting,
you know?
Yeah.
Well,

1566
01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:20.280
they uh,
if their good especially,
you know,
it's about,

1567
01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:22.470
you could have a real issue,
a real smart,

1568
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:25.480
this was the guy's name from South Africa.
The other name.
Oh

1569
01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:30.260
<v 2>Wow.
Trevor's something smart.
Kids from smart man.</v>

1570
01:34:30.930 --> 01:34:34.050
Very Smart car.
SMART,
smart.

1571
01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.690
I love comedians like that.
Not Saying,
not taking this chair,
but he said this,

1572
01:34:39.691 --> 01:34:43.680
he said,
I flew 20 hours head from South Africa.

1573
01:34:43.681 --> 01:34:47.070
I really had a hard time and I did my research and I didn't want to offend

1574
01:34:47.071 --> 01:34:50.730
anyone.
I found this,
this one organization called the Klu Klux Klan,

1575
01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.650
very racist organization.

1576
01:34:52.651 --> 01:34:57.651
And it just baffled me that Ku Klux Klan actually means circle of brothers

1577
01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:02.850
<v 0>to be someone that hates black people.
Why would you call yourself the second</v>

1578
01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:08.780
that was fun?
The whole name down,
his name is Trevor.

1579
01:35:09.250 --> 01:35:13.460
Some Kevis sound and he broke down was Shit Klux Klan man.

1580
01:35:13.461 --> 01:35:17.240
He broke that part down.
I believe he made it to a very funny joke.

1581
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:21.390
It was very funny.
He's talking about African Americans.
He said,
he said,

1582
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:25.200
even though they're not real Africans,
right.
No one ever pointed that out.

1583
01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.760
That's funny one here.
You know what I'm saying?
Cause he's from Africa.

1584
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:33.890
So when he came and said that it was hilarious and I was watching all these

1585
01:35:33.891 --> 01:35:37.190
films and trying to get all my black lingual a Yo B,

1586
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:40.880
what up then the minute I got off the plane,

1587
01:35:40.881 --> 01:35:43.730
everyone thought that I was a Mexican because he's hilarious.

1588
01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:49.260
Light a South African dude.
That's funny.
Dude is brave man.

1589
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:52.190
He's a good dude.
Trevor's smart comedians.

1590
01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:56.570
You know guys that actually took the time to think about what they're getting

1591
01:35:56.571 --> 01:35:56.711
married.

1592
01:35:56.711 --> 01:35:59.810
Well I think people in different countries are being exposed to stand up.

1593
01:35:59.811 --> 01:36:01.130
They were never exposed to before.

1594
01:36:01.131 --> 01:36:05.810
The Internet to your standup was pretty much what your culture was like.

1595
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:08.780
The English sweep or had their own sense of humor.
The Americans,

1596
01:36:08.781 --> 01:36:11.090
different cities.
We had our own different sense of humor.

1597
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:13.700
But now because of the Internet,
everyone sends a humor,

1598
01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:15.380
gets distributed worldwide.

1599
01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:19.160
So people get influenced by all sorts of different artists from all over the

1600
01:36:19.161 --> 01:36:21.830
place.
You want me to tell you the one thing I remember about you,

1601
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:24.980
it was when you used to do the Anna Nicole Smith stuff.

1602
01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:30.620
But the thing I remember is I never knew who she was before.

1603
01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:35.390
I heard your before.
I heard your comedy on her,
your comedy,

1604
01:36:35.690 --> 01:36:38.500
and we went and sought this checkout.
Oh,
that's fun.

1605
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:40.240
You didn't know the whole story.
I didn't know anything.

1606
01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:45.600
This was way back in the day.
But you know,
you had to haul.

1607
01:36:47.370 --> 01:36:51.600
Oh Dude,
I wasn't,
it was like,
who is he talking about and,

1608
01:36:51.650 --> 01:36:55.820
and why does stripper married a billionaire?
Yeah,

1609
01:36:55.821 --> 01:36:57.890
there was no internet back then.
There was no internet.

1610
01:36:57.891 --> 01:37:02.540
We had to come get it from the horse's mouth.
You know,
that story was so awesome.

1611
01:37:02.541 --> 01:37:05.080
I mean,
I,
there was a hundred different comedians and had beds all night.

1612
01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:09.280
He couldn't pass it.
Ours was,
yeah,
yours was classic.
Nice man.
It was fun.
Stir.

1613
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:12.590
Well,
when something like that comes along for comedian for more than,
you know,

1614
01:37:12.591 --> 01:37:14.570
some people go,
oh,
the world's falling apart.

1615
01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:18.740
Comedian looks at something like that goes,
Oh yeah,
look what I got here.
Exactly.

1616
01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:21.730
I just found some money.
I went to go see playing in the games.
I was like,

1617
01:37:21.731 --> 01:37:25.250
I know I'm getting a bit at it.
Yeah.
You can't go though thinking that way.

1618
01:37:25.251 --> 01:37:28.700
You got to go and just enjoy getting in and out of it.
I was like,
there you go,

1619
01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:29.600
man.

1620
01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:33.980
He could have just smoked up and had a good fucking time like I did for,

1621
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:37.790
there'll be another movie to come along.
And they always,
they always want aliens.

1622
01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:41.480
They always read one when I sit down and watch it at home.
Okay.
Yeah.

1623
01:37:41.481 --> 01:37:45.860
I couldn't do it myself.
Thank you very much.
I couldn't make a movie myself,

1624
01:37:45.861 --> 01:37:50.290
but I'm fucking very critical,
you know,
it was a lot of movies.
Just support,

1625
01:37:50.370 --> 01:37:51.440
bore the shit out of me.

1626
01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:55.980
I can't do it myself rather than one that's not boring

1627
01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.960
<v 4>to people.
You know,
I wrote it for paramount.
It's about the movie is about,</v>

1628
01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:05.520
uh,
uh,
the sec a slasher movie,
but it's a comedy.
It's a dark comedy about,

1629
01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:09.890
uh,
these two guys that used to be pimps ready.

1630
01:38:09.891 --> 01:38:13.470
It establishes them as pimps in the beginning of the movie and they'd get out of

1631
01:38:13.471 --> 01:38:17.490
the pimping game because there's some gangster dudes that come in,

1632
01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:20.250
come to town and take over the whole industry.

1633
01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:24.830
Every industry pimping gambling.
Whenever you're doing these guys are gangsters.

1634
01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:29.580
Didn't take over the whole shit.
So how the dealers,
pimps quit,
quit,
quit pimping,

1635
01:38:29.581 --> 01:38:30.720
but before they do it,

1636
01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:34.950
they set these two guys up and these two guys get locked up.

1637
01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:36.030
They get a life sentence.

1638
01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:40.070
They said two guys up and they rob them for a $1 million.
This is,

1639
01:38:40.090 --> 01:38:44.040
it takes place like a 79 when what million dollars seem like it would last

1640
01:38:44.041 --> 01:38:47.610
forever and they give that speech.
This is the big one.
Breath,

1641
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:52.150
nothing cool Mickey.
This is enough money for my kids and my kids' kids.

1642
01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:56.250
I keep $1 million and it's two guys getting ready,

1643
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:59.250
so they set the guys up,
they get the money.

1644
01:38:59.251 --> 01:39:02.190
The guys go to jail 25 30 years later,

1645
01:39:02.191 --> 01:39:07.191
these guys get out because life is only 25 years now the other two guys are

1646
01:39:08.041 --> 01:39:12.960
totally not street.
They haven't been street with 30 years.
Then randomly guys,

1647
01:39:13.650 --> 01:39:15.060
these dudes been in prison.

1648
01:39:15.690 --> 01:39:20.690
They was hard when they went to prison and came out even worse and they figure

1649
01:39:20.851 --> 01:39:23.190
out that these guys did what they did.
They're looking for them.

1650
01:39:23.191 --> 01:39:24.180
They want their money back.

1651
01:39:24.690 --> 01:39:29.690
And these guys have to pretend that they're something that pretended that Jews

1652
01:39:30.170 --> 01:39:34.230
standing and where you really don't want to bother us because we could kill you.

1653
01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:36.900
I know you're tough and all that,
but you've been in jail.

1654
01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:41.370
You don't know what's going on out here.
Now we run this,
but it's all an act.

1655
01:39:41.371 --> 01:39:44.850
And the guys that are with them are actors from an acting school.

1656
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:48.780
And they fooled these guys very briefly in the movie.

1657
01:39:48.781 --> 01:39:53.340
But when they realize that it was a trick,
they go back to the acting school,

1658
01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.770
beat up all the actors,

1659
01:39:56.130 --> 01:40:00.210
find out who told you what the whole plan was,
how you,

1660
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:04.230
what the plan was to use the triggers.
Now that after those guys,

1661
01:40:04.650 --> 01:40:09.540
now while all this is happening,
there's a stalk and the movies serial killer,

1662
01:40:09.541 --> 01:40:11.550
it kills only pimps.

1663
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:14.830
It's called the pimp store.

1664
01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:19.170
So from the beginning of the movie all the way to the hand while the story is

1665
01:40:19.171 --> 01:40:23.280
unfolding with these two guys that stole his money and they basically trying to

1666
01:40:23.281 --> 01:40:26.600
find a way to give them money back without getting killed.
It's like,

1667
01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.090
like in that movie,
uh,

1668
01:40:28.410 --> 01:40:31.890
which way is up with a bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier,

1669
01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:35.400
the type of thing we did a Flim Flam we want to find our way out of it.

1670
01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:38.670
Give you your money back.
Get out of it while they're trying to do this.

1671
01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:40.590
There's the pimp stalker killing preamps.

1672
01:40:40.591 --> 01:40:45.340
The cops think that the two guys that are after them,
all the pimps,
stalkers.

1673
01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:50.250
What?
He's not.
They're not
Brian.
I'm loving it man.

1674
01:40:51.250 --> 01:40:55.920
I'm going to quiz you on the plot.
Yeah,
cause I'm on to Plat.
All right.
Okay,
so,

1675
01:40:55.930 --> 01:41:00.670
so there's this serial killer dude.
He hates Pam once in a murder or a mall.

1676
01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:05.170
And then there's this group of pimps that are ruined the city with these other

1677
01:41:05.171 --> 01:41:08.900
groups of guys came in and someone goes to jail for something.
Huh?
Crypt.

1678
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.050
Because 25 years life.
That's life.
That's life nowadays.

1679
01:41:14.050 --> 01:41:15.900
When do you get when you get five years is his life.

1680
01:41:16.710 --> 01:41:19.390
If I give you life in prison,
that's 25 years.
Really?

1681
01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:22.660
So after 25 years you can get out.
That's crazy.

1682
01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:25.930
Now sometimes it's life without parole.
That's what they have to say.

1683
01:41:25.931 --> 01:41:30.070
Life without parole.
They say like you can get out.
Wow.

1684
01:41:30.190 --> 01:41:31.930
So these guys get out.
You know what I'm saying?

1685
01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:36.500
And they're after these two dudes who are now like soccer dads with big guts on,

1686
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:37.940
dude works at the church,
you know,

1687
01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:42.100
you know he did that and that street people anymore and they're forced to go

1688
01:41:42.101 --> 01:41:46.600
back into the world that they snuck away from to pretend you know,

1689
01:41:46.601 --> 01:41:49.300
for a little while.
But it doesn't work.
They get caught.

1690
01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.680
You guys want their money back.
It's all,
you know.

1691
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.140
I don't want to get too deep in.
They probably already did.
The Shit is funny.

1692
01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.710
Did you write your book also or do you write up my book too?
That's awesome.

1693
01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.710
It's not your book's about you not doing it again.

1694
01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:03.800
I'm a better writer than I am a pitcher.

1695
01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:12.630
Pitcher.
I just am.
You know,
you read scribbled,

1696
01:42:12.710 --> 01:42:15.010
you would understand it a whole lot better than me sitting here.

1697
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:18.340
You know what the problem is it to you and the problem with telling us 30

1698
01:42:18.341 --> 01:42:22.830
seconds you start and then you got to keep going because then you've got express

1699
01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:25.990
things happening.
You've got a lot of shit going on,
a lot of shit.

1700
01:42:26.050 --> 01:42:28.750
It's hard to pay attention.
All that shit.
Special effects.

1701
01:42:29.110 --> 01:42:32.020
You gotta show me some shit.
Shit looking at you.

1702
01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.560
You gotta show me some Shit Shit going on in the movie.
The movie's funny.

1703
01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:40.090
The only thing that may change by the movie is the title because the word pimps

1704
01:42:40.091 --> 01:42:42.910
again,
I'm like I to have to come up with something better than that.

1705
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:45.640
The movie is not,
I don't want people to think of movies.

1706
01:42:45.641 --> 01:42:48.520
He comes to see a movie about Pam.
So that's not what it's about.

1707
01:42:48.970 --> 01:42:53.680
The movies about these two guys that went straight and then element is trying to

1708
01:42:53.681 --> 01:42:56.140
draw them back.
Charlie Murphy,
what we need is Goddamn TV.

1709
01:42:56.141 --> 01:42:58.000
She'll phone you around and talk.

1710
01:42:58.001 --> 01:43:00.180
Well and I've got something like that I'm doing with Terry crews.

1711
01:43:00.190 --> 01:43:02.210
Man called up my bed.
We're going to,

1712
01:43:02.590 --> 01:43:06.730
once I deal with the bio channel and it's going to be me and Terry crews,

1713
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:08.870
the pilot is me doing,
you know,

1714
01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:13.030
telling you a story about something that I did to a person years ago that was

1715
01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.230
fucked up,
you know,

1716
01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:19.450
and then I do a reenactment of what I did to the person and then I go back and

1717
01:43:19.451 --> 01:43:21.510
find the person and I give them their money back.

1718
01:43:23.370 --> 01:43:27.640
My idea for charming back in 74 and he thought that by written by Bob,

1719
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.630
and you thought that I was with you when I set you up to be robbed.

1720
01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.200
And it was all of that,
you know,

1721
01:43:32.201 --> 01:43:35.020
and I give the guy his money back and I'm apologizing.

1722
01:43:35.050 --> 01:43:37.960
So what are we going to do on a bio channels?
Everyone has something,

1723
01:43:37.961 --> 01:43:39.520
maybe not as extreme as me,

1724
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.950
but southern that you did is somebody in your pants that you wouldn't mind

1725
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:45.910
apologizing for saying,
Hey,

1726
01:43:45.911 --> 01:43:49.060
you know what I did Bob about and I'm sorry,

1727
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:52.400
and we're going to use all celebrities,
every celebrity guest,
somebody

1728
01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:56.210
<v 0>that he did something fucked up to.
Who Do you do something fucked up to Joe?</v>

1729
01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:58.720
Trying to think.
Why are you saying that,
that you would like to,

1730
01:43:58.910 --> 01:44:02.990
that you never apologized and she wouldn't mind apologizing.
Maybe Peter Chin.

1731
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:06.450
Oh,
I did keep him from hosting

1732
01:44:06.850 --> 01:44:11.120
<v 6>[inaudible] nuts.</v>

1733
01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:12.520
He was doing that shit as a joke.

1734
01:44:13.670 --> 01:44:16.190
<v 0>Chris Mcguire was auditioning for Mitzi.</v>

1735
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:21.590
Mitzi thinks it's funny to let Peter Chan host the open mic night.

1736
01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:26.540
Fucking brutal man is wrong.
I mean something's wrong with Peter Chan.

1737
01:44:26.570 --> 01:44:28.380
And he was fighting and he would,
uh,

1738
01:44:28.970 --> 01:44:32.030
it was almost like a parody of like the worst common camera.
Like,
you know,

1739
01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:34.400
explain,
explain Peter Chan

1740
01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:38.980
<v 2>Chin is a,
he was a nice guy offstage,</v>

1741
01:44:38.981 --> 01:44:41.190
but there's something wrong.
Yeah.
It,

1742
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:45.750
there was something wrong because his comedy was so bad that you would,

1743
01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:49.610
you would,
you would sit in the audience and literally start hating him.
Barely,

1744
01:44:50.610 --> 01:44:54.880
you know,
kind of comes aggressively guy.
He was aggressively bad.

1745
01:44:54.881 --> 01:44:59.530
Like you would be like,
why is he,
how dare this idiot?

1746
01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:03.140
And he had a,
he had,
um,
he like,
he,
he,

1747
01:45:03.141 --> 01:45:07.630
he over accented and,
uh,
his,
his accent,

1748
01:45:08.290 --> 01:45:11.460
that wasn't even a real accent.
Oh is is,
is,
uh,

1749
01:45:11.530 --> 01:45:15.100
well he had a bad English II.

1750
01:45:15.370 --> 01:45:20.130
A funny thing happened on the way to seven revenue.
Uh,

1751
01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:23.380
I was like,
Yo,
what are you doing?

1752
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:28.310
<v 0>Was any part of Don Buress is a,
she used to dad.
What is that?</v>

1753
01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:32.240
What it used to call Brian?
Ding Dong.
Ding Dong shut down.
We would have these,

1754
01:45:32.241 --> 01:45:36.350
all these,
the worst comedians possible and the country like this fish,

1755
01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:41.690
all the misfit crazy people and put together a Ding Dong show.
Yeah.
He's,

1756
01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:44.420
you know,
he's got amazing tolerance,
you know,

1757
01:45:44.421 --> 01:45:47.960
and he would always be hanging around with these cats is these characters and

1758
01:45:47.961 --> 01:45:51.590
these,
these dudes.
So there's anybody that I would apologize,
maybe that guy,

1759
01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:54.580
cause I did bump in one night at the comedy store,
but I did it for my friend.

1760
01:45:54.581 --> 01:45:58.190
That had to be another,
I mean it doesn't have to be at another entertainment.

1761
01:45:58.191 --> 01:46:01.670
It could be anyone.
Okay.
Somebody did something to in fifth grade.

1762
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:04.460
I think it's a great idea.
That's a great idea to be on the bio,

1763
01:46:04.570 --> 01:46:09.260
but it's gonna be me and Terry going with different people at the part where I

1764
01:46:09.261 --> 01:46:13.370
come in and the reenactment,
we're going to always make the reenactment comedy,

1765
01:46:13.730 --> 01:46:15.260
you know,
I think it's a great idea,

1766
01:46:15.261 --> 01:46:18.170
but I think the world's being starved from a Charlie Murphy TV show.

1767
01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:21.560
That's what I'm saying.
So he used to follow you.
We got that,
we got that.

1768
01:46:21.561 --> 01:46:26.561
And we also got the other show I'm doing and I think that's going to be rich

1769
01:46:26.631 --> 01:46:30.600
falling asleep.
But so we had,
we had,

1770
01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:33.050
there was the whole digital thing.
We get ready to build up,

1771
01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:37.000
you know it's going to be a camera.
The whole digital thing.
Yeah.

1772
01:46:37.001 --> 01:46:39.860
We gave me only a man such as Charlie Murphy can get away with saying that,

1773
01:46:39.861 --> 01:46:42.740
you know the whole digital thing.
Oh that's one thing that's going on right now.

1774
01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:43.020
Yo.

1775
01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:46.660
Nothing up building my whole digital department of know money and you started a

1776
01:46:46.661 --> 01:46:50.270
podcast.
I am.
That's all [inaudible] mom,

1777
01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:52.080
<v 4>Joe,
this all in the makings.</v>

1778
01:46:52.081 --> 01:46:55.500
But I only could do one thing at a time and what I was focusing on this year,

1779
01:46:55.530 --> 01:46:59.000
it was right in that movie.
I just finished writing and you know,

1780
01:46:59.030 --> 01:47:00.330
getting ready to do the TV show.

1781
01:47:00.331 --> 01:47:04.930
I mean we do a 20 episodes over the next six weeks.
What I'm getting,

1782
01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:07.880
I'm focusing on those two things and once that's done,
boom,

1783
01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:11.370
then it's onto the next,
the next area.
I'm not there.

1784
01:47:11.410 --> 01:47:14.390
I don't sit back on my hunches at all.
Definitely not.
You got DVDs,

1785
01:47:14.391 --> 01:47:15.230
books and movies,

1786
01:47:15.231 --> 01:47:18.350
everything and like you got to go website everything with the wife man.
Yeah,

1787
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:21.590
exactly.
I keep working hard.
I'll have one eventually.
You know,

1788
01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:25.880
it says it's going to be hard to marry after your wife dies.
What does it feel?

1789
01:47:25.881 --> 01:47:30.320
It's not going to be hard to marry.
It's hard to be single.
Being single.

1790
01:47:30.321 --> 01:47:31.370
It sucks.

1791
01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:37.220
Especially if you've got kids because like I have to sneak the APP stacks,

1792
01:47:37.221 --> 01:47:42.180
man.
Come on man.
You go through that when you were in high school.

1793
01:47:43.170 --> 01:47:46.950
But if you have your person that you're married to happens to pass away or

1794
01:47:46.951 --> 01:47:51.150
whatever,
you can't bring chicks around and bone them kids.
You can't do that man.

1795
01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:54.570
Especially not being filed or you lie,
you can't sneak them up to the room,

1796
01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:56.550
any of that.
Because when they come in and if you have a daughter,

1797
01:47:56.551 --> 01:48:00.330
she's going to go,
Hey,
who is that?
That's when my daughter got,

1798
01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:04.280
then she goes right over to the person.
Start monopolizing them.
Who are you?

1799
01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.900
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
And she makes sure,

1800
01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:11.280
so you're having a sleep over and no she's not.
So you had to sneak.

1801
01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:15.360
Yeah man.
Being singles and you know after you were married for years,
it's wack.

1802
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:20.320
Well I was married for years,
so I want to,
you know,

1803
01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:24.550
the lifestyle,
you know,
my wife is gone,
but the lifestyle,
yeah,
I missed that man.

1804
01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:30.700
Definitely being single sex,
make single checks.
Don't cook for you.

1805
01:48:30.701 --> 01:48:32.740
You don't want them to cook.
You don't even trust them.

1806
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:36.580
Especially if they suggest to you is actually spaghetti.
And I don't know.
No,
no,

1807
01:48:36.581 --> 01:48:39.460
no,
no,
no.

1808
01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:44.740
You know,
you gotta be married.
It's trusted him to,
you know,
enjoy those things.

1809
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:47.330
It's also gotta be hard when you're on the road,
you know,

1810
01:48:47.331 --> 01:48:50.420
you're on the road constantly.
It's hard to spend time with someone.

1811
01:48:50.421 --> 01:48:53.420
They get to know them once you take them with you and you can't take somebody

1812
01:48:53.421 --> 01:48:55.460
with you.
They own life going on.

1813
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:58.940
And if you say come with me and you get basically saying quit your job,

1814
01:48:58.941 --> 01:49:01.100
but I'm not telling no one to quit the job.

1815
01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:05.440
He had quit your job and come with me.
Oh No,
I'm not doing that.
So he said,

1816
01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:08.840
he say it's hard man.
Especially when you barely know them.
You know,

1817
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:10.910
cause that's really what it is.
Until you live with someone,

1818
01:49:10.911 --> 01:49:14.030
you don't really don't know him that well.
You do,
but you don't.
You don't,

1819
01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:17.480
you don't see you live with and that's a key part and that's when they can get

1820
01:49:17.481 --> 01:49:18.314
to know

1821
01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:21.870
<v 2>about a year of living with someone.</v>

1822
01:49:21.871 --> 01:49:26.640
I mean living with someone,
you got to,
you got to say at least three years,

1823
01:49:27.210 --> 01:49:29.910
cause something's going to have three years is a good time.

1824
01:49:30.130 --> 01:49:33.470
She's rails be asked at some point.
Right,
right,
right.

1825
01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:37.960
<v 4>You get to know the person,
man,
so you know,
that's,
that's like my,</v>

1826
01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:40.780
that's the paradox in my life right now.
You know,

1827
01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:44.590
people were looking go easy.
Everyone likes him,

1828
01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:48.580
he's doing great in his business and then it's showbiz and blah blah blah.
Yes,

1829
01:49:48.610 --> 01:49:53.080
that's good.
But that's not real life.
That's a job.
A real life is my family.

1830
01:49:53.081 --> 01:49:56.320
My real life is when you come home with Nate and lights go off,

1831
01:49:56.410 --> 01:50:01.410
you get on stage and that's the part where there's a big hole because my wife is

1832
01:50:02.081 --> 01:50:05.440
going and it's not as simple as one would think,

1833
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.940
oh,
it's hard.
It's harder than you would think as far as friends,

1834
01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:14.500
somebody to to fill in that area.
Of course there's plenty of people would say,

1835
01:50:14.501 --> 01:50:17.980
oh,
I would do it outcome,
but it's not the person you want.

1836
01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:21.310
You have to be very careful.
You have run the children.
Yeah man.

1837
01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:23.770
I want to slap a few of these chicks.
Okay.

1838
01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:28.870
How can I move in with you to take care of your children?
Really,
you will,
you,

1839
01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:31.330
you a horror.

1840
01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:35.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1841
01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:36.310
<v 4>What are you guys with that</v>

1842
01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:44.070
or
get confused by the accent.

1843
01:50:44.071 --> 01:50:45.920
I thought it was an inside joke that I was missing out on

1844
01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:52.960
tuition for your brother.
And while you're actually touring as a comedian,

1845
01:50:52.961 --> 01:50:56.910
that's gotta be really hard.
Yeah.
Nick is,
I got my kids with me.
At any rate,

1846
01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:59.320
I got my son sends in your living room right now.
Yeah,

1847
01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:02.890
I got my kids out here with me right there.
And you know,
schools giving a start.

1848
01:51:03.250 --> 01:51:07.450
So they're going to be with me till September 6th taking them back home,

1849
01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:08.530
hanging out with him that week.

1850
01:51:08.531 --> 01:51:12.910
School starts then you know that that was back when we get gotta get new
jerseys.

1851
01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:15.660
That's a judge.
You still in the live in New Jersey and Pennsylvania too.

1852
01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:19.370
But this was in Philly last weekend,
man.
Yeah.

1853
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:21.780
I live in having a house in Strausberg.
No,

1854
01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:25.240
but I'm just saying once that goes back into effect,

1855
01:51:25.450 --> 01:51:28.960
I'm still going to be coming.
I gotta come back out here,
work on the show.

1856
01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:34.150
I got to go to Europe,
I got to go to Cuba.
It's the jar.
We're so,

1857
01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:36.310
I can't complain,
but I'm glad I had the job.

1858
01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:39.970
But that's the part of it that the fact that their mother is that here,

1859
01:51:40.330 --> 01:51:43.720
that makes it really rough.
Yeah.
I automatically,

1860
01:51:43.721 --> 01:51:47.010
I was leaving you with your mind was I wouldn't even,
I been to get us to go.

1861
01:51:47.590 --> 01:51:50.800
Right.
I'm not leaving with you.
What's your mom's leaving you with nannies.
Right.

1862
01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:51.640
You know what I'm saying?

1863
01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:55.270
Cause my whole family lives out here on the west coast or whatever and because

1864
01:51:55.570 --> 01:51:58.450
I'm at the kind of person that,
you know,
leans on people like that,

1865
01:51:59.470 --> 01:52:00.880
I appreciate your help,

1866
01:52:00.881 --> 01:52:03.700
but I'm going to ask him for it and if you don't or if I'm,

1867
01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:06.890
I'm not going to complain about it.
I do it myself.
Yeah.

1868
01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:11.100
And that's how I raised my kids.
You know what I'm saying?
I got paid,
my name's,

1869
01:52:11.110 --> 01:52:14.500
I don't ask somebody to help me out.
I'll do what I got to do with the same time.

1870
01:52:14.501 --> 01:52:18.430
There's a feeling that goes along with that and then don't feel good,
you know,

1871
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:21.970
as,
how do you do like video conferencing with your kids?
Yeah.

1872
01:52:21.971 --> 01:52:25.460
You try to do as much as possible.
I got Skype and all that,
but that's good.
Yeah.

1873
01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:31.510
Young man.
I got a five year old daughter,
you know,
and just don't want this.

1874
01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:36.270
The thing you do is to support them.
Be The thing that,
that,
uh,
uh,
disabled.
Right?

1875
01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:39.520
You don't like when they grow up and my father was never home,

1876
01:52:39.521 --> 01:52:43.090
he was always working and blah,
blah,
blah.
And that's the reason why,
you know,

1877
01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:46.370
my life went this way.
That's my fear.
You know,
Ryan,

1878
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:50.120
I work with that one constantly.
You know,
that's the,
the fear of every father.

1879
01:52:51.230 --> 01:52:54.650
How much time can you spend in doing what you want to do for a living?

1880
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:59.810
If you don't do it,
he's getting molded or whatever.
You don't teach him,

1881
01:52:59.811 --> 01:53:03.020
he's going to learn somewhere else,
you know?
And it may be,
you know,

1882
01:53:03.021 --> 01:53:06.680
warped sense of,
uh,
like me for instance,
when I was growing up,

1883
01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:10.370
my dad was always at work,
always.

1884
01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:15.470
I was seeing one day a week Saturday and usually I wasn't big to,
you know,

1885
01:53:15.710 --> 01:53:16.351
to be nasty,

1886
01:53:16.351 --> 01:53:18.590
but that's what he was getting your ass whipped for what you did during,

1887
01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:20.360
during the week.
You know what I'm saying?
Yes.

1888
01:53:20.361 --> 01:53:25.130
When you dad showed up to whip your ass and sanity
as a result,

1889
01:53:25.670 --> 01:53:29.990
when I grew up and became a man,
when it came time for me to deal with women,

1890
01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:36.020
I learned how to deal with women by listening to guys that were in the street

1891
01:53:36.170 --> 01:53:40.960
bombs,
guys,
nick t bone is slick and big willies,

1892
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:45.470
whatever.
And because of that,
the first couple of relationships I had with women,

1893
01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:47.750
I was abusive.
Dude,
man,

1894
01:53:48.570 --> 01:53:50.990
I would think to think what you're talking back to me,

1895
01:53:50.991 --> 01:53:54.410
the answers I'm supposed to hit you because that's what slick told me.

1896
01:53:55.190 --> 01:53:58.910
That's not what you're supposed to do.
If your dad is there to teach you that,

1897
01:53:59.300 --> 01:53:59.931
you know better.

1898
01:53:59.931 --> 01:54:02.330
But if you don't grow up with that around you grew up with something else

1899
01:54:02.490 --> 01:54:04.610
because you're going to be seeking in hours,
you go,

1900
01:54:04.730 --> 01:54:06.800
you go out and do the wrong thing.
You know?

1901
01:54:07.790 --> 01:54:10.240
So that's what I think about what my kids that I want to,

1902
01:54:10.490 --> 01:54:13.760
you want to be at and make sure you did deliver all the lessons they need.

1903
01:54:14.150 --> 01:54:18.890
But then when you go to half my team is gone.
Is that not to do about that?

1904
01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:23.560
It makes it real scared.
Especially when you start looking at,

1905
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:27.870
well all the people who are talking about they want to be the replacement you go

1906
01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:32.900
must be out of your mind.
You're thinking,
what bring you bring you around.

1907
01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:37.280
I mean our relationship is fine over here,
but do you think it would bring you,

1908
01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:42.650
I think we found the show.
This is the show,
this show.

1909
01:54:42.710 --> 01:54:46.020
The show was doing so calm on what's really fucking going on in your life now.

1910
01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:50.380
Well that's why,
that's why the show I'm doing,
it's not their job to sign.

1911
01:54:50.381 --> 01:54:54.360
And that is exactly see me dealing with my kids,
man,
Ma.

1912
01:54:54.610 --> 01:54:58.050
And I'm single.
I'm going to have the same,
you know,

1913
01:54:58.051 --> 01:55:01.620
challenges as I have in my real life and I could definitely bring it,

1914
01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:06.330
uh,
uh,
experience.
Do you ever do you ever,

1915
01:55:06.670 --> 01:55:08.330
I have done it,
but my kids don't.

1916
01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:13.410
Kids don't like to be at work with you,
you know,

1917
01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:17.670
for no longer than five minutes.
When they get there,
they check it out,
but okay.

1918
01:55:17.671 --> 01:55:21.900
And then where's the toy?
Is that,
where's my world?
Where's the kitty things at?

1919
01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:25.850
So I had my kids with me on the road when their mom was alive,

1920
01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:30.350
but since she's passed away,
I haven't had them with me because I'm a horrible,

1921
01:55:30.910 --> 01:55:34.340
uh,
uh,
fun buddy for a kid.

1922
01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:39.860
We'd go to Seattle.
Oh,
let's go,
let's go check out too.
I'll be in the room going,

1923
01:55:39.861 --> 01:55:41.450
well,
if I go there,
um,

1924
01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:45.570
I have to sign autographs and take pictures.

1925
01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:50.020
I'm not going to be able to do it the way you guys,
so,
and it's gone.
It's gone.

1926
01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:53.970
You don't go to just like go to Disneyland.
I have to go on certain days,
man.

1927
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.220
You what I'm saying?
I don't go when it's,
when it's peak,

1928
01:55:56.221 --> 01:56:00.750
you know everybody's dead because then I become goofy or,
or,
or,
or Mickey Mouse.

1929
01:56:00.751 --> 01:56:04.050
You know what I'm saying?
To the people who came here on vacation.
You know,

1930
01:56:04.051 --> 01:56:09.051
like the other day we were standing on a vine on 1717 branches hotel called the

1931
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:12.390
Red Berry,
right?
It's right on the walk of fame and all that.

1932
01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:14.760
My kids in the hotel looking out the balcony,

1933
01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:18.700
we want to go for a walk and I said,
okay,
you can go for a walk with the nanny.

1934
01:56:18.701 --> 01:56:19.321
It's no way.

1935
01:56:19.321 --> 01:56:23.760
I want to walk on the walk of fame in broad daylight with my kids.

1936
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.490
And I know that that's a tourist attractions.
People on buses,
you know,

1937
01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:29.700
driving around here,
the tour buses,

1938
01:56:29.701 --> 01:56:33.110
driving around on the star searches or what have you,
and if you,

1939
01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:36.870
from Kansas or wherever you may be from him and you go to Hollywood and you see

1940
01:56:36.871 --> 01:56:38.940
someone you seen on television,
what are you going to do?

1941
01:56:39.810 --> 01:56:42.450
You're going to go crazy and you should.
So that's why I was like,

1942
01:56:42.451 --> 01:56:45.090
you better stay in your room because if you go down there with your kids,

1943
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:48.120
it's not going to be,
have you ever thought about it like disguises,

1944
01:56:48.121 --> 01:56:51.750
like blonde way?
Absolutely not.
I refuse.
I

1945
01:56:53.670 --> 01:56:57.370
really blew that actually happened on Patrick.

1946
01:56:57.980 --> 01:57:02.980
They brand new Saint Patrick's Day parade a week before that it was a blackout

1947
01:57:05.251 --> 01:57:08.670
in my town.
Had lost power my house for like a week,

1948
01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:10.770
staying in New York and in London hotel.

1949
01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:15.700
So Saint Patrick's Day was during that week.
I wasn't,
I'm an Irish email on,

1950
01:57:15.701 --> 01:57:16.590
my name is Murphy.

1951
01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:20.460
I don't see and I'll be aware of when Saint Patrick's Day is coming up,
you know,

1952
01:57:20.850 --> 01:57:23.610
so it does.
Last name is Rogan and I don't know why it's coming up.

1953
01:57:23.670 --> 01:57:24.810
I walked outside with,

1954
01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:27.900
you know my two kids and he was walking around Manhattan supposedly going to

1955
01:57:27.901 --> 01:57:30.960
walk over to central park and I see all of the hoop alone fit ma'am.

1956
01:57:30.961 --> 01:57:33.930
And I'm like,
Oh,
it's St Patrick's Day.

1957
01:57:34.590 --> 01:57:38.400
Do you kids want to go to the Saint Patrick's Day parade?
He was like,
Yeah Daddy.

1958
01:57:38.401 --> 01:57:42.540
Because they had never been.
I walked him,
just me and my two kids,
man.

1959
01:57:42.570 --> 01:57:44.250
I walked him up to the crowd,

1960
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:49.050
put my daughter on my shoulder and we were watching the parade and hurt
somebody.

1961
01:57:49.051 --> 01:57:53.280
Go,
Yo,
that's Charlie Murphy.
Yo,

1962
01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:57.420
that's Charlie Murphy.
Then it started from this side,
the left and the right.

1963
01:57:57.421 --> 01:58:00.390
And then you see the people looking at you and they're coming forward.

1964
01:58:00.391 --> 01:58:02.610
And my daughter started screaming,
man,

1965
01:58:02.611 --> 01:58:06.900
because it was a lot of people and they had a pressed on the wall,
the building

1966
01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:11.730
screaming and my daughter's screaming,
you know,
and from fear,
man,

1967
01:58:11.731 --> 01:58:16.440
I'm holding my son's arm and it had to just turn it into like an animal man.

1968
01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:21.690
Get the f out of here.
That's just pushed through the crowd.
And I looked my kids,

1969
01:58:21.691 --> 01:58:23.910
man,
and that's,
I'm doing it.
I'm going,
you're an idiot.

1970
01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:28.340
What made you think that you could stand on fifth avenue in,

1971
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:33.000
in broad daylight,
on Saint Patrick's day and of crowd with your children.

1972
01:58:33.001 --> 01:58:34.470
And that was the safe thing to do.

1973
01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:38.850
But I forgotten for that one split second what I do for a living,

1974
01:58:40.350 --> 01:58:42.710
it came,
you know what I'm saying?
You can't make the of me,
there's

1975
01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.160
blonde wig and that's what I would,

1976
01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:49.080
<v 8>yeah,
wrestling.
No one would bother you.</v>

1977
01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:53.110
Never wearing a disguise cause you're not fooling anyone.

1978
01:58:53.111 --> 01:58:56.220
They look over it and go that so and so with a disguise on.

1979
01:58:56.330 --> 01:59:00.130
I could be a furry and you would never know that Joe Rogan over there.

1980
01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:03.050
<v 4>Yeah,
that'd be a Fox.
That's what it would be.</v>

1981
01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:09.430
One of those dudes wandering around that don't mind.
People coming up to me,

1982
01:59:09.431 --> 01:59:13.450
you know,
if I'm,
I'm not with my kids,
it's part of it.
But when you were children,

1983
01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:16.120
it's different.
You were thinking about this safety or whatever,

1984
01:59:16.121 --> 01:59:17.770
especially in a crowded situation.

1985
01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:22.480
And then when you have somebody that's really not acting like an adult jumping

1986
01:59:22.481 --> 01:59:26.740
around and screaming loud,
that's hard fans who a kid,
man.
You know?

1987
01:59:26.741 --> 01:59:31.360
So yeah,
I'm really,
I'm real sensitive about that.
You know,
which I shouldn't be.

1988
01:59:31.361 --> 01:59:33.220
I'm a parent,
I guess any,
any parent would be,

1989
01:59:33.221 --> 01:59:34.960
you don't see that somebody skin shit.

1990
01:59:35.210 --> 01:59:38.600
<v 3>Jolen no,
of course.
I'm sensitive about that too.
You gotta you gotta be careful.</v>

1991
01:59:38.601 --> 01:59:43.310
But I go everywhere.
I just go places,
you know,
I beat people most,

1992
01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:45.920
most of the time people leave me alone.
And when people say,

1993
01:59:45.921 --> 01:59:48.260
how are they usually pretty nice.
And when I'm with my kids,

1994
01:59:48.261 --> 01:59:51.190
very rarely do they ask for pictures and then I just say,
man,
come on man,

1995
01:59:51.191 --> 01:59:51.610
you got my kid

1996
01:59:51.610 --> 01:59:51.970
<v 7>zero.</v>

1997
01:59:51.970 --> 01:59:56.970
And Luckily you could pretty much take care of business if you have to like,

1998
01:59:57.130 --> 01:59:57.700
let me see,

1999
01:59:57.700 --> 02:00:01.390
Louis C K had an episode last week about the same thing happening where he was

2000
02:00:01.391 --> 02:00:04.960
out with his kids and these two guys came up and started like,
yeah,

2001
02:00:04.961 --> 02:00:07.690
we're going to get you,
you know like get his kids and stuff like that.

2002
02:00:07.691 --> 02:00:11.380
It was fucking scary.
Oh Wow.
And it,
but you know,

2003
02:00:11.381 --> 02:00:15.430
Louie is not a big guy and these guys were like big and the show and stuff.

2004
02:00:15.431 --> 02:00:17.080
But that's too scary.

2005
02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:20.980
<v 4>I had that thing where,
you know,
the way most people became and know me,</v>

2006
02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:25.810
the way my nap name was pronounced to them as it stream is the way they say it

2007
02:00:25.811 --> 02:00:29.590
back.
Okay.
You're not screaming men just because they excited.

2008
02:00:29.890 --> 02:00:31.430
That's the way it Charlie Murphy,

2009
02:00:31.590 --> 02:00:35.430
<v 8>were you supposed to say it?
How you supposed to say?</v>

2010
02:00:35.850 --> 02:00:39.090
<v 4>So when you get 10 people doing it from different directions and you're holding</v>

2011
02:00:39.091 --> 02:00:41.670
your kid who doesn't even,
you know,

2012
02:00:42.690 --> 02:00:44.490
understanding any of the dynamics of that,

2013
02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:48.430
it's going to scare the shit out your kid.
You talked to Dave Chappelle.
Yeah,

2014
02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:51.690
I talked to him last week,
man.
David,
how's he doing?
He's doing it right.

2015
02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:56.720
He's still doing some stand up,
you know,
uh,
and uh,

2016
02:00:56.770 --> 02:01:00.460
that's divided as far as what I know that he's involved in.

2017
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:03.210
I heard a rumor that he was doing something on the Internet,

2018
02:01:03.211 --> 02:01:04.170
but I don't think that's true.

2019
02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:05.440
<v 3>Yeah,
I heard that wrong.
And Chubb,</v>

2020
02:01:05.710 --> 02:01:09.220
I just wish the guy would do more standup and I wish it would put out some DVDs

2021
02:01:09.221 --> 02:01:12.460
or something,
you know,
cause a brilliant comedian man.

2022
02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:16.310
Just when's the last time you heard that one of his bed though?
You know,

2023
02:01:16.330 --> 02:01:18.670
it's just,
it's unfortunate,
you know,
I mean,

2024
02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:22.420
I love a guy like Louis C K and puts out a new,
a DVD every year or so,

2025
02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:25.180
but I just wished,
you know,
David puts something out.

2026
02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:30.570
<v 4>Well,
you know,
I would think that eventually he's going to have to,
you know,</v>

2027
02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:33.510
because yes.
To be doing something.
I mean,

2028
02:01:33.511 --> 02:01:36.170
he may have had a lot of money when he first walked away.
What?

2029
02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:39.680
You're spending any money?
Eventually you had to do something right.
You know,

2030
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:41.570
you had to put something out and do something.

2031
02:01:42.010 --> 02:01:42.471
<v 0>Can you just go,</v>

2032
02:01:42.471 --> 02:01:44.930
I'm going to have enough went into the red last the rest of my life.

2033
02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:49.400
When you had kids,
she got four kids.
All right.

2034
02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:53.840
Exactly.
Dave.
Dave lives in Ohio,
right?
Yeah.

2035
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:58.250
Even when even in Ohio,
$1 million ain't gonna last you very long,
man.

2036
02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:01.610
<v 4>A couple of million dollars.
But you know,</v>

2037
02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:05.460
you got to work with what's Ohio all about?
Why is live out there?
Oh,

2038
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:09.880
it was very sheltered life.
You got money moved to Ohio.
Kids are going to be,

2039
02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:14.960
you have to worry about nothing,
man.
What do you mean safe man?
It's,
it's,
it's,

2040
02:02:15.010 --> 02:02:19.040
you know,
it's not a fast moving place.
Oh,
I says not a lot of,
you know,

2041
02:02:19.470 --> 02:02:23.520
crime and all that other stuff.
I grew up in Ohio.
Oh.
He lives on a farm.

2042
02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:28.320
Really?
He lives near hippies like silver springs or high or whatever.

2043
02:02:28.321 --> 02:02:32.650
It's like a lot of the hippies over there.
Really good skiing.

2044
02:02:33.250 --> 02:02:34.083
Yeah.

2045
02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:36.300
<v 0>Hippies in a farm.
All right folks.</v>

2046
02:02:36.330 --> 02:02:39.420
That's how we're going to end this hippies in the farm.
So the good life,

2047
02:02:39.810 --> 02:02:41.580
you'll never see me do it,
Charlie.

2048
02:02:43.930 --> 02:02:46.680
It's been a lot of fun being your friend,
man.
It's been a lot of fun meeting you.

2049
02:02:46.830 --> 02:02:49.820
Had a great time doing that and we're going to do it.
Cool.

2050
02:02:49.890 --> 02:02:51.630
We're going to do it again,
man.
I'm gonna do something.

2051
02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:53.040
I would love to have something with you.

2052
02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:56.700
I'm just glad we got this done because we've been trying to do this for about

2053
02:02:56.701 --> 02:02:57.511
two years.
Yeah,

2054
02:02:57.511 --> 02:03:01.550
we've been talking about feeling like Joe Joe at this point probably thinks that

2055
02:03:01.551 --> 02:03:06.240
I'm foot as age.
Nah,
man.
Joe,
I'm want to come through your podcast.

2056
02:03:06.241 --> 02:03:09.480
I want to come through and come through Joe and,
but we were never here.

2057
02:03:09.570 --> 02:03:10.710
I know your business.
Fucking,

2058
02:03:10.711 --> 02:03:12.960
I know you've got kids cause I'm busy as fuck and I got kids.

2059
02:03:12.961 --> 02:03:15.930
I know what it never here man.
No worries.
Dude.
It was fun about it.

2060
02:03:15.931 --> 02:03:20.240
NTU in Hawaii too.
That was kind of crazy.
Just reel me in Hawaii.

2061
02:03:20.241 --> 02:03:23.790
It was when I first started writing it movie that just fits on that.

2062
02:03:23.791 --> 02:03:27.680
On that vacation is when I started writing.
That's what ruined the vacation.

2063
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:30.430
I don't know where we were staying at the same hotel together,

2064
02:03:30.630 --> 02:03:33.200
brainstorming and all that small roles.
Relaxing

2065
02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:36.160
<v 4>man.
And that was with a girl who I,</v>

2066
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:40.780
I don't know if you've seen her.
I was in love with that girl or that girl,

2067
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:45.400
the one I took the away fell in love with the girl then with the kids and I was

2068
02:03:45.401 --> 02:03:48.640
like,
this is going to be the one that introduced to my children.

2069
02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:53.440
And she was perfect.
And then we had a conversation and she told me,

2070
02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:55.060
uh,
you know,

2071
02:03:55.090 --> 02:03:59.080
I just realized from observing you and your children that you're a pussy of a

2072
02:03:59.081 --> 02:04:03.640
father.
Well,
how's like,
well what did she tell you?
Give your kids are,

2073
02:04:03.641 --> 02:04:05.890
that would be one.
And it's two reasons why.

2074
02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:09.640
One is because they lost the mom and the other ones because you feel guilty

2075
02:04:09.641 --> 02:04:10.630
because you go on the road.

2076
02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:14.320
But when I meet your kids and when they introduced in the tough love and I was

2077
02:04:14.321 --> 02:04:17.590
like,
really?
All right,
well I talked to you later.

2078
02:04:18.250 --> 02:04:20.420
I've never talked to him again since then.
And that was the girl.

2079
02:04:20.421 --> 02:04:22.600
I hadn't Hawaii anytime.
Wow.

2080
02:04:22.630 --> 02:04:26.110
What do you mean going to introduce my kids to tough love.
Whoa.

2081
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:30.870
<v 0>Yeah,
that's instinctual.
The mothers don't like other children.
You know,
the,
the,</v>

2082
02:04:30.910 --> 02:04:35.800
the new wife doesn't like the,
uh,
the,
the children of the lost mother.
Natural.

2083
02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:38.130
It's natural.
It's very,
you're going to have to find

2084
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:39.900
<v 3>a powerful woman.
You know,</v>

2085
02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:44.880
a woman who a is really pure and honest and loving and you know someone who

2086
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.360
really is going to love and respect those kids.
Let's fucking do this.

2087
02:04:49.230 --> 02:04:52.740
<v 5>Let them know if you're doing anything to my kids.
If you are a defendant,</v>

2088
02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:56.490
was anything I'm going to match.
We're gonna match your contribution to you.

2089
02:04:56.700 --> 02:04:57.720
How many evil stepmother

2090
02:04:59.110 --> 02:05:03.270
<v 3>in the,

Stepmothers.

2092

You come around my kids,
if my kids tell me anything,
I hear you said it did.

2093
02:05:11.841 --> 02:05:15.060
And then when I was not around,
I'm taking your word for it.

2094
02:05:16.230 --> 02:05:19.630

that's,
you know,
that's what I,

2095
02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:20.151
I'll look at it.

2096
02:05:20.151 --> 02:05:23.370
