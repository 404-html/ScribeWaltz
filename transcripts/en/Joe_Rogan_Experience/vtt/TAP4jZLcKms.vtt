<v Speaker 1>you were going through this breakup,</v>

8
00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:11.810
<v Speaker 1>you'd kind of reassessed your whole life.</v>

9
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.430
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting to watch.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you came when you called me up and you were really bummed out and she kicked you</v>

13
00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>out and you were at a hotel room.</v>

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:24.680
<v Speaker 1>just a little frazzled.</v>

00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:40.970
<v Speaker 1>it's like just fucking feeling of shit.</v>

41
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a home anymore.</v>

42
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.101
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

43
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>where am I sleeping now?</v>

44
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.621
<v Speaker 2>Civ like,</v>

45
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:45.951
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

46
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.150
<v Speaker 2>towards your direction,</v>

48
00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:48.320
<v Speaker 2>change complete.</v>

49
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.170
<v Speaker 2>You've been living this certain way along enough to,</v>

50
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.210
<v Speaker 2>to get used to it and then all of a sudden everything absolutely changes,</v>

51
00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.220
<v Speaker 2>like just a huge torque turn that you probably thought could happen.</v>

52
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:01.640
<v Speaker 2>But you're,</v>

53
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

54
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.450
<v Speaker 2>trying to imagine that it wasn't even a possibility and it happens.</v>

55
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.261
<v Speaker 2>Well that,</v>

56
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:06.591
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

57
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 2>that's like you go into shock,</v>

58
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 2>you're attached to a certain rhythm,</v>

59
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.500
<v Speaker 2>a certain pattern,</v>

60
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 2>a certain set of surroundings that massively changes you.</v>

61
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 2>You go into shock and that is the perfect time to get in a fucking flotation</v>

62
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:23.600
<v Speaker 2>tank when everything's discombobulated and floating around inside of you and all</v>

63
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:24.650
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>

64
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.041
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

65
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 2>weird assemblage of emotions.</v>

66
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:29.120
<v Speaker 2>And more than anything though,</v>

67
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.880
<v Speaker 2>what's cool about that shit is you get a real taste of truth.</v>

68
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what truth is right there.</v>

69
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:36.380
<v Speaker 2>That's like the experience of truth,</v>

70
00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:37.370
<v Speaker 2>which is change,</v>

71
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 2>which is dramatic.</v>

72
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.030
<v Speaker 2>Radical change.</v>

73
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Fucking unavoidable happens all the time.</v>

74
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.711
<v Speaker 1>Did the,</v>

75
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>the isolation tank keeps you from distracting yourself and makes you think about</v>

76
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:48.710
<v Speaker 1>your life?</v>

77
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>It makes you think about what's going on.</v>

79
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 1>So for me it was so fascinating having you here at a real low point.</v>

80
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Speaker 1>And watching you pull right out of it right out of it,</v>

81
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>like very quickly,</v>

82
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.730
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

83
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

84
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>you got into that tank within a few weeks,</v>

85
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

86
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you were laughing about shit and joking around about it.</v>

87
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.981
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

88
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:07.814
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

89
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

90
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:08.901
<v Speaker 2>They always cool.</v>

91
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

92
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.801
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

93
00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 2>it definitely,</v>

94
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 2>definitely helps.</v>

95
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:17.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's why this is my friends are so important because like if you don't</v>

96
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.130
<v Speaker 2>have friends and you get into that predicament oh,</v>

97
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.731
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

98
00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:24.950
<v Speaker 2>So worst feeling more it feel completely alone.</v>

99
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

100
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:25.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

101
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

102
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.320
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

103
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:28.370
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't have friends,</v>

104
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:30.350
<v Speaker 2>you can still pull yourself out of it,</v>

105
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:31.250
<v Speaker 2>but you have to,</v>

106
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.500
<v Speaker 2>I guess really Wa you know,</v>

107
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:33.770
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

108
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 2>you have to want to,</v>

109
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

110
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

111
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.710
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

112
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.031
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

113
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:37.211
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

114
00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:37.691
<v Speaker 1>it's mean,</v>

115
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:37.931
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

116
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:38.141
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

117
00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:41.410
<v Speaker 1>anyone can can improve their surroundings so you can improve your situation.</v>

118
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:44.980
<v Speaker 1>But it was really interesting for me watching you because it was a such an</v>

119
00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:48.100
<v Speaker 1>unusual opportunity for both of us.</v>

120
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.370
<v Speaker 1>It was an unusual opportunity for me to watch someone who didn't have a lot of</v>

121
00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:52.480
<v Speaker 1>experience with a tank,</v>

122
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>but who was such a curious person and psychedelically experience like you and</v>

123
00:02:57.581 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>then have access to this thing a on a daily basis,</v>

124
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.091
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

125
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>And for me to watch you go from this like really low point to like,</v>

126
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>they're like really like gaining ground.</v>

127
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Like you came out of it like stronger.</v>

128
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.510
<v Speaker 1>It was so fucking cool</v>

129
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 2>climbing out of that thing in that state of being in the,</v>

130
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 2>in the state of like having had,</v>

131
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.870
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

132
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 2>so I could,</v>

133
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.530
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics are not limited it drugs.</v>

134
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 2>There are many ways to induce a psychedelic state of mind.</v>

135
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 2>The tank being one of them.</v>

136
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

137
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 2>another way to induce a psychedelic state of mine is to have dramatic change</v>

138
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:38.431
<v Speaker 2>happened in your life that rips back whatever delusion you are living by and</v>

139
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 2>shows you</v>

140
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.190
<v Speaker 1>the true universe.</v>

141
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

142
00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:45.660
<v Speaker 1>People turn to the term psychedelic to a lot of people means like seeing things</v>

143
00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:47.490
<v Speaker 1>that aren't their hallucinations,</v>

144
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.600
<v Speaker 1>dancing mice,</v>

145
00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:48.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:49.501
<v Speaker 1>Shit like that.</v>

147
00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Pink elephants flying in the sky.</v>

148
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.370
<v Speaker 1>That's not a real psychedelic state.</v>

149
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 1>The real psychedelic state is the dissolution of cultural conformity and the,</v>

150
00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>the Ah,</v>

151
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.540
<v Speaker 1>your ideas of the universe,</v>

152
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.660
<v Speaker 1>all your predetermined patterns of thinking all your,</v>

153
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.700
<v Speaker 1>you're adopted behavior patterns,</v>

154
00:04:05.701 --> 00:04:09.360
<v Speaker 1>all that gets stripped away and you're left with the core of you and your</v>

155
00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:10.260
<v Speaker 1>decisions and,</v>

156
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.101
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>

157
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:12.660
<v Speaker 1>what you can and can't change.</v>

158
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.380
<v Speaker 1>And how you led yourself into a position where you were so weak in the first</v>

159
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:17.011
<v Speaker 1>place that you,</v>

160
00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:17.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:18.780
<v Speaker 1>you needed saving from.</v>

162
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

163
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.281
<v Speaker 1>what were,</v>

164
00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:21.870
<v Speaker 1>why did you have no foundation?</v>

165
00:04:21.871 --> 00:04:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Why did you fall apart?</v>

166
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it about,</v>

167
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.050
<v Speaker 1>life and about trying to get by in this world that leaves us so fucking</v>

169
00:04:28.051 --> 00:04:32.730
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable sometimes and so in need of other human beings is to to stack us up</v>

170
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:37.110
<v Speaker 1>and to hold us up and watching you man was really fucking cool.</v>

171
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.820
<v Speaker 1>It was really cool because you really used it,</v>

172
00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:39.001
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

173
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:40.050
<v Speaker 1>You got in there all the time,</v>

174
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.891
<v Speaker 1>and you are,</v>

176
00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:42.720
<v Speaker 1>you are getting out and talking about it.</v>

177
00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:43.141
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

178
00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:44.070
<v Speaker 1>it was fucking trip.</v>

179
00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:44.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

180
00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you wrote it about it in the thing because I didn't read it.</v>

181
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

182
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I've had that thing for years that they didn't even take a look at that.</v>

183
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I read to him over the phone and then he made me stop and I said,</v>

184
00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:54.421
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

185
00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I won't read any more of it.</v>

186
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.760
<v Speaker 1>I was just eight years ago,</v>

187
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I got a thing has been sitting in my fucking,</v>

188
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.730
<v Speaker 1>my office for tariff.</v>

189
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like 2004 so what year was this?</v>

190
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Wait til I didn't date it.</v>

191
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.760
<v Speaker 1>2004 or 2005 I believe it was.</v>

192
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.851
<v Speaker 1>It's cool though.</v>

194
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:12.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

195
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

196
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.880
<v Speaker 1>you got a window into a certain time in your life.</v>

197
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.840
<v Speaker 1>You know where you were.</v>

198
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.610
<v Speaker 1>You were in the shifts.</v>

199
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

200
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you man,</v>

201
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 2>that unfortunately happens.</v>

202
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.970
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

203
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.511
<v Speaker 1>you say that,</v>

204
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's unfortunate at all.</v>

205
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.101
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

206
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

207
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 1>If you were stuck with that chick now,</v>

208
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

209
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.153
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

210
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.121
<v Speaker 1>Think about that.</v>

211
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about your situation now and thinking about your situation then,</v>

212
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:34.350
<v Speaker 1>how much happier you are now,</v>

213
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:34.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

214
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>You could have been stuck.</v>

215
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Me Ma,</v>

216
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.001
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

217
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>if you talked her into taking you back or something gross.</v>

218
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.683
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

219
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>with a child or something.</v>

220
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ right there.</v>

221
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.071
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

222
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how you're a different human now then.</v>

223
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

224
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>you're so much more confident.</v>

225
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.321
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

226
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that I saw when you went up in Montreal,</v>

227
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

228
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I keeping your sats now you're so much more confident.</v>

229
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.831
<v Speaker 1>You go up there,</v>

230
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:57.820
<v Speaker 1>you're much more,</v>

231
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

232
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 1>you're so much more,</v>

233
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.540
<v Speaker 1>what's the word you,</v>

234
00:06:01.541 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

235
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 1>you were re resigned to who?</v>

236
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:05.280
<v Speaker 1>You are not,</v>

237
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.021
<v Speaker 1>not resigned.</v>

238
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Rather you're,</v>

239
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.483
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

240
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's not resigned that,</v>

241
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 1>cause that sounds like you're giving up.</v>

242
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.481
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

243
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>that's not what I mean.</v>

244
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.421
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

245
00:06:12.421 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 1>you are completely aware of who you are.</v>

246
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the best way of saying it.</v>

247
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 1>And that when you're going on stage now you're going on stage,</v>

248
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 1>not trying to convince them of anything.</v>

249
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.860
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>

250
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 1>this is me and this is what I'm doing is what I have to say.</v>

251
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Whereas before you were like,</v>

252
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:26.511
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

253
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 1>I hope you like me.</v>

254
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.851
<v Speaker 1>Do you like me?</v>

255
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:29.511
<v Speaker 1>You don't like me?</v>

256
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:29.781
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

257
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 1>here I'm going to say something,</v>

258
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

259
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.263
<v Speaker 1>I guess that,</v>

260
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

261
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason the word resigned popped out of your mouth first is because I</v>

262
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:40.000
<v Speaker 2>think there is a certain level of being,</v>

263
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.310
<v Speaker 2>and it sounds like it's like I'm giving up,</v>

264
00:06:42.311 --> 00:06:46.420
<v Speaker 2>but resigned can also be like a kind of surrender where you're like,</v>

265
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm just no longer going to spend time,</v>

266
00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:53.680
<v Speaker 2>whether on stage or off stage.</v>

267
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to spend time anymore trying to convince myself or other people</v>

268
00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:01.720
<v Speaker 2>that I'm some certain way and I'm going to start trying to approach people from</v>

269
00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:02.560
<v Speaker 2>where I'm at.</v>

270
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

271
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.730
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>

272
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.420
<v Speaker 2>which is not a perfect place for most people.</v>

273
00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Most most of us are,</v>

274
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

275
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.400
<v Speaker 2>have fucked up things that we do.</v>

276
00:07:12.401 --> 00:07:13.360
<v Speaker 2>And why wouldn't you?</v>

277
00:07:13.361 --> 00:07:13.601
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

278
00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:15.490
<v Speaker 2>you're going to look at where you're at.</v>

279
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.481
<v Speaker 2>Like you say,</v>

280
00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:19.120
<v Speaker 2>we're in a fucking ball flying through fucking space.</v>

281
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.850
<v Speaker 2>How are you supposed to adapt to this?</v>

282
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.440
<v Speaker 2>And some brilliant way,</v>

283
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.880
<v Speaker 2>right off the bat,</v>

284
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:25.550
<v Speaker 2>you know you,</v>

285
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

286
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.650
<v Speaker 2>it's a champ.</v>

287
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.850
<v Speaker 2>You're in this insane dimension where were getting rocketed through space where</v>

288
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:31.870
<v Speaker 2>you're to die.</v>

289
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.100
<v Speaker 2>You're surrounded by people who call themselves your family that you're supposed</v>

290
00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:37.480
<v Speaker 2>to have attachments to,</v>

291
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:38.830
<v Speaker 2>they're going to die.</v>

292
00:07:38.831 --> 00:07:42.670
<v Speaker 2>You're in a life where you've just adopted certain modes of being.</v>

293
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:43.990
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a baby,</v>

294
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.250
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get married,</v>

295
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.720
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people do when they weren't ready and they weren't supposed to and</v>

296
00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:54.070
<v Speaker 2>they get married and they have a baby and they are theoretically for this</v>

297
00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:54.904
<v Speaker 2>incarnation,</v>

298
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
<v Speaker 2>pretty fucking trapped there in</v>

299
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:57.930
<v Speaker 1>lot of people are,</v>

300
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.270
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have yet they have all kinds of weird situations where the</v>

301
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.040
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

302
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.500
<v Speaker 1>they're stuck somehow or another,</v>

303
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:06.600
<v Speaker 1>whether it's because of a mortgage or because of a business that they started</v>

304
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:07.443
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

305
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.930
<v Speaker 2>a mental idea of how things are supposed to do with some person or you give</v>

306
00:08:10.931 --> 00:08:15.931
<v Speaker 2>birth to a child that has like a a melted brain and you've got to take care of</v>

307
00:08:16.571 --> 00:08:21.571
<v Speaker 2>like a little like sick kid for 12 years or like there's so many different ways</v>

308
00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:27.421
<v Speaker 2>that your particular DNA can get reverberated down into a shitty trap where</v>

309
00:08:28.961 --> 00:08:30.360
<v Speaker 2>you're just like there.</v>

310
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.151
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

311
00:08:31.151 --> 00:08:32.230
<v Speaker 2>that's why I liked that movie.</v>

312
00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:35.230
<v Speaker 2>You said you didn't want to see it and I'm sorry if you've seen it in like it,</v>

313
00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:37.270
<v Speaker 2>but what was that hundred and 27 hours?</v>

314
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>

315
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.271
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

316
00:08:38.271 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it because I knew the story and I,</v>

317
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to wash them.</v>

319
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Did</v>

320
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:42.720
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

321
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 2>That's just a torture movie.</v>

322
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.020
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to watch.</v>

323
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Everybody says that it's a torture movie.</v>

324
00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Like it was fixated on the Gore or the,</v>

325
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:50.781
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't,</v>

326
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking metaphor,</v>

327
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:52.574
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>

328
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:53.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

329
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 2>some times doing the,</v>

330
00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.350
<v Speaker 2>you love to do whatever it is and that's for a lot of people's fucking doing the</v>

331
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 2>thing you love most,</v>

332
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.070
<v Speaker 2>you can end up getting your goddamn arm pen down.</v>

333
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.400
<v Speaker 1>You're connecting someone,</v>

334
00:09:07.401 --> 00:09:09.230
<v Speaker 1>having a baby to cutting your arm off.</v>

335
00:09:09.231 --> 00:09:09.680
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

336
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.101
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

337
00:09:10.101 --> 00:09:10.934
<v Speaker 2>I'm kidding.</v>

338
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

339
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm not connecting.</v>

340
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.110
<v Speaker 2>If you have a baby for the right reason.</v>

341
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.311
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

342
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying for the wrong reasons.</v>

343
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:15.871
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

344
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:16.490
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>

345
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Like you were saying what a lot of single people with no children say.</v>

346
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.030
<v Speaker 1>And what you're saying is,</v>

347
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:21.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

348
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:24.540
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about our friend who tweeted something about having a child is</v>

349
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:26.670
<v Speaker 1>like the exact opposite of winning the lottery.</v>

350
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

351
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I used to think the exact same way until I had children,</v>

352
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 1>but my situation is very different in that,</v>

353
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:33.781
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

354
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm older,</v>

355
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I've had more experience in life and um,</v>

356
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm secure financially and happy in the relationship.</v>

357
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 1>So it was all good things at a good time.</v>

358
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 1>But when I look back on past relationships,</v>

359
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:46.970
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>

360
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.990
<v Speaker 1>there was a bunch of relationships that I've been in,</v>

361
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

362
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.880
<v Speaker 1>like way back in the day when I was younger and I really didn't know what the</v>

363
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:56.430
<v Speaker 1>fuck I was doing and I was hanging around with chicks that I probably really</v>

364
00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 1>didn't even like that much,</v>

365
00:09:57.541 --> 00:09:59.070
<v Speaker 1>but I was still having sex with them.</v>

366
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.910
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you'd have like a crazy fucking breakup or we're crazy bad</v>

367
00:10:02.911 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

368
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 1>That person could be out there with your kid and then you have to deal with all</v>

369
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:09.390
<v Speaker 1>kinds of the nonsense that comes with that.</v>

370
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:09.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

371
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:11.390
<v Speaker 1>we all know somebody that has kids.</v>

372
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.590
<v Speaker 1>You know some shit situation.</v>

373
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:14.821
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

374
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:16.110
<v Speaker 1>I hear what you're saying man.</v>

375
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.340
<v Speaker 2>What did that so what yeah,</v>

376
00:10:18.341 --> 00:10:20.650
<v Speaker 2>what I'm really saying is like the,</v>

377
00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.790
<v Speaker 2>the idea and it goes back to what we're being comfortable resigned to who you</v>

378
00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:25.624
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

379
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 2>That's where I didn't like the way I said resign though I didn't mean reside is</v>

380
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:31.540
<v Speaker 2>just sometimes you hard to be resigned.</v>

381
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.321
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

382
00:10:32.321 --> 00:10:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Not all of us are fucking Charlie Sheen,</v>

383
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.640
<v Speaker 2>not all stars from Mars.</v>

384
00:10:36.641 --> 00:10:37.191
<v Speaker 2>Not all of us,</v>

385
00:10:37.191 --> 00:10:38.930
<v Speaker 2>sort of a freaking rock star from Mars.</v>

386
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Some of us are like,</v>

387
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.330
<v Speaker 2>we all are trying to pretend that I'm not special or fucked up.</v>

388
00:10:43.331 --> 00:10:44.420
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of ways man,</v>

389
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:44.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

390
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.280
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

391
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.061
<v Speaker 2>if you start from,</v>

392
00:10:46.061 --> 00:10:46.894
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

393
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

394
00:10:47.861 --> 00:10:49.210
<v Speaker 2>one thing that I would try to do,</v>

395
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:51.130
<v Speaker 2>and I used to work out and it's like when I,</v>

396
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.610
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

397
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.170
<v Speaker 2>when I first started working out,</v>

398
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.210
<v Speaker 2>I would try to lift weight that was so much more heavy than what I should have</v>

399
00:10:58.211 --> 00:11:02.320
<v Speaker 2>been lifting out of this sense of like I could lift heavy weights.</v>

400
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.540
<v Speaker 2>And so now I'm like trying to live like way too well.</v>

401
00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:07.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't like why should it be at the fucking pink weights?</v>

402
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.820
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like trying to take a quick,</v>

403
00:11:09.821 --> 00:11:10.301
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

404
00:11:10.301 --> 00:11:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do like really fucking heavy weights cause it's like this is how I</v>

405
00:11:13.721 --> 00:11:17.880
<v Speaker 2>see myself down the line after I've been lifting pink waits for awhile.</v>

406
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.450
<v Speaker 2>That's how you get to the heavyweights.</v>

407
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.770
<v Speaker 2>But if you start off right away trying to pump those fucking heavyweights,</v>

408
00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.270
<v Speaker 2>then it's disaster.</v>

409
00:11:25.271 --> 00:11:28.660
<v Speaker 2>You're going to pull your fucking muscles like people how,</v>

410
00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:30.610
<v Speaker 2>you know like due to lifting weights.</v>

411
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.690
<v Speaker 2>One guy think came up to me,</v>

412
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.750
<v Speaker 2>he's like looking at me like what are you doing?</v>

413
00:11:34.751 --> 00:11:37.900
<v Speaker 2>He's like that's way too much weight.</v>

414
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.010
<v Speaker 2>And so this is like having a kid when you're 16 having a kid when you were 16 or</v>

415
00:11:42.011 --> 00:11:47.011
<v Speaker 2>deciding that you're a famous comedian before you are getting on stage after a</v>

416
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.020
<v Speaker 2>couple of months and getting in your fucking head that you're like you've been</v>

417
00:11:50.021 --> 00:11:55.021
<v Speaker 2>doing standup for 15 years or being a fucking when and like just immediately</v>

418
00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:56.500
<v Speaker 2>thinking you're a great painter.</v>

419
00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Cause I've had friends who've gotten into painting,</v>

420
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

421
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.440
<v Speaker 2>And they've only painted for a year and they show me some of their paintings and</v>

422
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:03.610
<v Speaker 2>the look on their face is like,</v>

423
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:04.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to react to it.</v>

424
00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm seeing a Picasso or something.</v>

425
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:08.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like I hate</v>

426
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.900
<v Speaker 1>almost everyone that shows me things that I'm supposed to look at that they did</v>

427
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.210
<v Speaker 1>almost every time someone does that to me.</v>

428
00:12:14.211 --> 00:12:15.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

429
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>are you really going to do this to me man,</v>

430
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm these.</v>

431
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:17.683
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

432
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.930
<v Speaker 1>don't make me read your fucking script.</v>

433
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Don't ask me to read your script.</v>

434
00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:25.490
<v Speaker 1>You fuck take you read my script row.</v>

435
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.473
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst.</v>

436
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.310
<v Speaker 1>The worst is when it's bad.</v>

437
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.500
<v Speaker 1>And then you're obligated to talk to them and go,</v>

438
00:12:30.501 --> 00:12:30.741
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

439
00:12:30.741 --> 00:12:31.730
<v Speaker 1>here's the situation.</v>

440
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.301
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

441
00:12:32.301 --> 00:12:37.301
<v Speaker 1>you basically did men and black meets back to the future written by a 12 year</v>

442
00:12:37.461 --> 00:12:38.060
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

443
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:38.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

444
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:38.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

445
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:39.703
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

446
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:41.280
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that.</v>

447
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.170
<v Speaker 1>We can't even say that.</v>

448
00:12:42.171 --> 00:12:42.501
<v Speaker 1>You have to go,</v>

449
00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:42.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

450
00:12:42.771 --> 00:12:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm as pretty good man.</v>

451
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.833
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good.</v>

452
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Well now then you're gonna see that's the thing.</v>

453
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.990
<v Speaker 2>That's where you get and I think kind of what we're talking about,</v>

454
00:12:48.991 --> 00:12:52.230
<v Speaker 2>which is like at some point you have to make a decision.</v>

455
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to spend the rest of my life lying to the world?</v>

456
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to spend the rest of my life men trying to manipulate people around</v>

457
00:13:01.411 --> 00:13:05.630
<v Speaker 2>me because I'm too lazy to tell them the truth or am I just going to start</v>

458
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:06.620
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth?</v>

459
00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.521
<v Speaker 1>But what if it though,</v>

460
00:13:07.521 --> 00:13:09.680
<v Speaker 1>if it's a friend that's written something really cool though,</v>

461
00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.190
<v Speaker 1>what if someone has got a script and it means,</v>

462
00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:13.940
<v Speaker 1>so that's the problem with all the shitheads that want you to read their scripts</v>

463
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.300
<v Speaker 1>and makes you super skeptical for the occasional rare person that actually write</v>

464
00:13:17.301 --> 00:13:18.830
<v Speaker 1>something good and it's just like,</v>

465
00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:18.951
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

466
00:13:18.951 --> 00:13:19.860
<v Speaker 1>I think this is pretty good.</v>

467
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.140
<v Speaker 1>You want to read it and then you're like,</v>

468
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

469
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:21.801
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

470
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll read it.</v>

471
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.791
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

472
00:13:22.791 --> 00:13:23.210
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

473
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.110
<v Speaker 1>how many of those are there?</v>

474
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.340
<v Speaker 2>People I know who are really good at things,</v>

475
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.020
<v Speaker 2>they don't ask me to look at it.</v>

476
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.960
<v Speaker 2>I ended up looking at it cause I want to like my friend email,</v>

477
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:34.410
<v Speaker 2>he just visited like his music's fucking good.</v>

478
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.660
<v Speaker 2>So like I tried to get new cds of his,</v>

479
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.980
<v Speaker 2>cause I wanna listen to it.</v>

480
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.600
<v Speaker 2>That's really fucking good.</v>

481
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.020
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes somebody else sends you something</v>

482
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.440
<v Speaker 1>or somebody be in their car if they're a musician and then they'll put their</v>

483
00:13:45.441 --> 00:13:45.830
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

484
00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.000
<v Speaker 2>don't have to listen to it.</v>

485
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:54.950
<v Speaker 2>That is never let a musician drive and never let them get in your car with a CD.</v>

486
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:56.363
<v Speaker 2>It's in your hand,</v>

487
00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.043
<v Speaker 2>your fucking hand,</v>

488
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.550
<v Speaker 2>because you're suddenly,</v>

489
00:14:01.551 --> 00:14:06.200
<v Speaker 2>you're forced suddenly not just to evaluate how miserable and artists they are,</v>

490
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.300
<v Speaker 2>how close Shane shitty their music is.</v>

491
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.350
<v Speaker 2>But also you have to,</v>

492
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.910
<v Speaker 2>you realize that the fact that they felt comfortable playing this for you means</v>

493
00:14:13.911 --> 00:14:14.840
<v Speaker 2>they think it's good.</v>

494
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.770
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

495
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.270
<v Speaker 2>they're so diluted and sell.</v>

496
00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:17.691
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

497
00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:17.991
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

498
00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:18.680
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

499
00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.011
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

500
00:14:19.011 --> 00:14:19.221
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

501
00:14:19.221 --> 00:14:21.140
<v Speaker 2>they've been waiting all day to play their music.</v>
