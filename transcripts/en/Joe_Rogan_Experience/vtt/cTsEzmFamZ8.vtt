1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.600
To me.

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.990
I have four.

3
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:02.940
We'll talk about it.

4
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.773
Three.

5
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:06.930
Yes.

6
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.470
And we're live.

7
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.280
Hello.

8
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.970
Hey Joe,

9
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.420
welcome.

10
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.253
Thank you.

11
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.540
Oh,

12
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.281
that's great to be here.

13
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:12.000
Thanks for having me.

14
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.833
My pleasure.

15
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.310
Sam Harris sends his regards.

16
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:14.821
Yeah.

17
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.050
Sam's a beautiful man.

18
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.590
He is.

19
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.423
I love that guy.

20
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.500
And he's one of the reasons why you're here.

21
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.363
Um,

22
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.290
so universal basic income.

23
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.460
This is what this is all about.

24
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.773
Yes,

25
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.360
that's what my campaign for president is all about.

26
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.433
That's uh,

27
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.910
an interesting,

28
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.140
like a focus of a campaign and very unusual.

29
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:37.740
And I mean four years ago you'd never even thought that that would have a chance

30
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:38.574
at all.

31
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.700
But this is a subject that has been gained momentum and it made it,

32
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.540
I made a big shift because a,

33
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:49.380
I had my friend Eddie Wong on once and he was the first person to bring it up

34
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:52.590
and my initial knee jerk reaction was get the fuck out of here.

35
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.470
Like universal basic income,

36
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.340
just getting to give people money that just going to be lazy.

37
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:57.330
Nothing's ever going to get done.

38
00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:58.260
That's a terrible idea.

39
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.070
And then I started paying attention to the rise of AI.

40
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:05.780
And automation and how many jobs are going to get taken away.

41
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.370
And then once you see the actual numbers,

42
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.660
it's pretty staggering.

43
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.481
Yeah,

44
00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:11.370
and that's how I got there,

45
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:11.910
Joe.

46
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.030
Like I spent the last seven years running an organization that I had started

47
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:16.380
called venture for America,

48
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.920
and we helped create about 3000 jobs in Detroit,

49
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.760
Cleveland,

50
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.660
Saint Louis,

51
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.523
Birmingham,

52
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.011
New Orleans,

53
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:24.180
other cities around the country.

54
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.170
And I saw that were pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole of ripped

55
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.004
in the bottom,

56
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.630
and that for every five,

57
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:33.900
10 50 jobs that my entrepreneurs are going to create,

58
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:36.450
we're going to lose five 10 50,000 jobs.

59
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.550
It's not something that people intuitively suspect could be a real issue either.

60
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.090
It's one of the ones where you kind of have to like go shake people like,

61
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:45.600
hey,

62
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.231
look at this.

63
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:47.064
This is coming.

64
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.030
There's a cliff.

65
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.680
We're going towards this cliff.

66
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.120
It's darker still.

67
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:51.510
And that,

68
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.670
so when I was digging into the numbers,

69
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.390
I found that it's not this cliff that we're heading towards.

70
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:00.780
It's actually more of a curve that we're on or what I've been telling people is

71
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:05.460
that we're in the third inning now where one of the main reasons why Donald

72
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.460
Trump won in 2016 is that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs that

73
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:11.700
were based in Michigan,

74
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.690
Pennsylvania,

75
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.823
Ohio,

76
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.850
Wisconsin,

77
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:15.361
Missouri,

78
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:15.661
Iowa,

79
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:18.030
all the swing states he needed to win in the center of the country.

80
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.370
And a lot of that was just manufacturing work.

81
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:21.360
And if you go to a factory,

82
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:23.820
you'll see it's this giant robot arms as far as the eye can see.

83
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.000
So it's not just that you have artificial intelligence on the horizon,

84
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.380
it's that we've been eating away at the most common jobs in the u s economy,

85
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.070
uh,

86
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.110
for almost 20 years now.

87
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.340
And it's just now hitting a point where it's pushing more and more unskilled men

88
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:39.630
in particular out of the workforce.

89
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.243
Now.

90
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.120
Are there other alternatives that you've considered other than just universal

91
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:45.960
basic income,

92
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:50.961
like educating people about this being a real issue and perhaps pushing them or

93
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.440
directing them towards other occupations?

94
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.071
Yeah,

95
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:57.610
so that that's the uh,

96
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.070
recipe that people are attracted

97
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.610
<v 1>to.</v>

98
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.000
So I just want to unpack the numbers a little bit more so people have a sense of

99
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:04.570
it.

100
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.230
I was just with a bunch of truck drivers in Iowa last week and there's a Guy

101
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.290
Dennis,

102
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.610
but gasky that gave me a ride from Altoona at Grinnell in Iowa where I had been

103
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:13.444
campaigning.

104
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.740
And the truth of it,

105
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:14.981
Joe,

106
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:18.730
is that there are three and a half million truck drivers in this country right

107
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.680
now is the most common job in 29 states.

108
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.210
And the average trucker is a 49 year old guy with a high school education,

109
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.650
maybe ex military,

110
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:28.330
like Dennis was a,

111
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:29.980
they're making like $50,000 a year.

112
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.001
So then if you say,

113
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:31.391
Hey,

114
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:36.391
I'm going to retrain half a million truck drivers for what exactly is like issue

115
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:38.014
number one.

116
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.680
And then these guys didn't love school 30 years ago.

117
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:45.940
It's not like driving a truck has made them really excited about the idea and

118
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:47.230
then the new job you're training them.

119
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.370
Before I looked into the data as to how good we were at retraining.

120
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.300
Let's say displaced manufacturing workers in the Midwest when we started

121
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.530
decimating their jobs and we're terrible at like according to independent

122
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:00.364
studies,

123
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.400
government funded retraining programs had a success rate of between zero and 15%

124
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.460
in real life.

125
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.240
Like this is what actually happened to the workers of Michigan and Indiana and

126
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:11.074
Ohio.

127
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.330
And so if you say we're going to retrain these people,

128
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:17.800
then you also have to come up with a way for us to become amazing at something

129
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:18.790
that right now we're really,

130
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:19.624
really bad at.

131
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.220
And if you were an employer,

132
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.083
which you are,

133
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.680
would you rather employ a 50 year old former truck driver with health problems

134
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:28.240
who got some certificate program?

135
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.140
What would you rather higher a 25 year old kid who went to community college is

136
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:33.160
probably cheaper,

137
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:38.161
has lower expectations and his skills are natively going to be a little fresher.

138
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.981
I mean,

139
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:40.000
if you were an employer,

140
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:41.080
you'd probably choose number two.

141
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.090
<v 2>I agree.</v>

142
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.780
Um,

143
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.720
but I,

144
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.250
I'm,

145
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.410
I mean I'm trying to look at this through rose colored glasses,

146
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:48.210
I guess.

147
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.570
Awesome.

148
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.020
Thank you.

149
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.430
If there's a way that these people can adapt,

150
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.671
<v 1>you know what I mean?</v>

151
00:04:52.671 --> 00:04:56.300
Some will for sure you can retrain and rescale some people,

152
00:04:56.301 --> 00:04:59.780
but if you look at even the conversations we're having around this where people

153
00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:03.020
legitimately talking about retraining coal miners to be software engineers,

154
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.720
stuff that on the face of it makes no sense.

155
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.980
But the reason why we're stretching for that is because we're looking for some

156
00:05:09.981 --> 00:05:13.790
kind of retraining oriented solution when the numbers show that that's just not

157
00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:15.020
going to be the recipe.

158
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.000
Therefore actual sex

159
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.760
<v 2>SAS,</v>

160
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.593
and this is where,

161
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.050
where this whole learn to code controversies coming out online where people are

162
00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:23.670
actually getting banned for riding,

163
00:05:23.671 --> 00:05:24.540
learn to code.

164
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.880
It's a really a hot subject on Twitter and it's very confusing too.

165
00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:33.450
And I haven't really gotten an explanation for why that's such an offensive

166
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:34.021
thing to say,

167
00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:36.200
but people are getting banned for economists.

168
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.210
This I know joking around saying learn to code and it's very weird.

169
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.470
But the idea behind it is that it's kind of preposterous to ask someone who

170
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:50.880
doesn't have an education to do something that's as difficult as code computer

171
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:51.714
language.

172
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.021
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

173
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:55.500
And unfortunately we're going to get to a point where AI can do some basic

174
00:05:55.501 --> 00:05:57.240
coding at a certain level.

175
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.990
So if you think about the impulse to say,

176
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:00.824
learn to code,

177
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.090
what it's really saying is you need to do something that the market values,

178
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.050
it's like,

179
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.291
Hey,

180
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:07.370
being a truck driver,

181
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.910
the market's not going to value that much when the trucks are driving themselves

182
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:12.800
in the next five to 10 years.

183
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.630
So what does the market value?

184
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.471
And then people are like,

185
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:16.250
well,

186
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.600
coding and stem and,

187
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:18.434
and uh,

188
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.370
engineering skills.

189
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:21.980
And so there's a drive to try and push people in those directions.

190
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.600
But if you look at the numbers,

191
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.963
uh,

192
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.420
about 8% of American jobs right now are in stem fields,

193
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:30.320
like in technology,

194
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:30.771
engineering,

195
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:31.080
math,

196
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.030
etc. So you're talking about 92% of the population that is not in those fields.

197
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.360
And it's unrealistic to expect that 92% to somehow shift into the 8% right in

198
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:41.240
there,

199
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.980
even be places for them.

200
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.050
Yeah,

201
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.780
that's true too.

202
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.160
Even if they perfectly seamlessly transition,

203
00:06:47.161 --> 00:06:48.890
there's too many people for those jobs.

204
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.431
Yeah.

205
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:53.000
So I've been driven to universal basic income in part because I've been looking

206
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:53.840
at the numbers.

207
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.340
The five most common jobs in the United States right now are administrative and

208
00:06:58.341 --> 00:06:59.270
clerical work,

209
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.680
retail and sales,

210
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.390
food service and food prep,

211
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.760
truck driving and transportation and manufacturing.

212
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.270
Those five jobs comprise about half of all American jobs.

213
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.480
Only 32% of Americans graduate from college.

214
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.780
So the average is a high school grad doing one of these five jobs.

215
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.921
And if you look at it,

216
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:19.010
technology is already doing a number on each of these jobs.

217
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.400
Like the first administrative and clerical includes call center workers.

218
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:25.790
And Ai is in the process of taking over that job.

219
00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:26.720
Retail and sales,

220
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:29.120
30% of malls are closing in the next four years.

221
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.131
So the,

222
00:07:30.131 --> 00:07:34.730
the danger here is to think of it as artificial intelligence is coming.

223
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.470
It's actually already eating up the most common jobs in our economy and it's

224
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.880
driving Americans into distress in various ways in the numbers.

225
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.710
Now when you talking about universal basic income too,

226
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.890
there's two questions that come up.

227
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.260
How much money and where's it coming from?

228
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.153
Yeah.

229
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.580
So first I want to say that if you look at the heritage of universal basic

230
00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:56.130
income,

231
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.600
it's a deeply American idea where Thomas Paine was forward at the founding of

232
00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:02.090
the country and then Martin Luther King was for it.

233
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.051
Milton Friedman,

234
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:05.990
the godfather of conservative economist was for it.

235
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.590
And one state has had it in effect for 37 years,

236
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:13.280
where everyone in that state gets between one and $2,000 a year,

237
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:14.150
no questions asked.

238
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:14.984
And this is Alaska,

239
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.621
Alaska,

240
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:16.850
and they funded with a oil money.

241
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.300
And what I'm going around telling people is that technology is the oil of the

242
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:21.170
21st century.

243
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.470
So I know you spoke to another guest about,

244
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:24.890
hey,

245
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.723
how do you get,

246
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.170
let's say approximately $3 trillion a year to fund universal basic income?

247
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.330
And a great thing is that it's,

248
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:32.631
well,

249
00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:34.700
the first thing is that it's not actually 3 trillion.

250
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.490
And the reason why it's not 3 trillion is that if you look at what we're

251
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:38.420
currently doing,

252
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.460
we have a,

253
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:44.840
we're spending about one point 5 trillion right now on 126 welfare programs and

254
00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:45.674
social security.

255
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.350
And so if you show up to someone's door and say,

256
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:49.184
hey,

257
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.890
here's a dividend of $1,000 a month,

258
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.920
but if you're already getting more than a thousand and stuff,

259
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:57.480
we're not just going to stack it on top.

260
00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:58.351
Uh,

261
00:08:58.351 --> 00:08:58.651
you know,

262
00:08:58.651 --> 00:08:58.911
we're going,

263
00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:00.570
just going to say you're guaranteed a thousand.

264
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.150
And if you're already getting more than this doesn't touch you,

265
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:04.410
you can keep your current stuff.

266
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.500
If you're getting 700 and food stamps and whatnot,

267
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.120
then you can just get 300 on top.

268
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.890
So the 3 trillion actually shrinks a lot very fast because of the fact that

269
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:16.800
about half of Americans are already getting various,

270
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.460
uh,

271
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.110
income support from the government.

272
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.380
So the real price tag is closer to about one point 8 trillion.

273
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.460
If you say everyone who's 18 and up now for context,

274
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.280
the entire US economy is now 20 trillion,

275
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.680
5 trillion in the last 12 years,

276
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.360
and the federal budgets 4 trillion.

277
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.700
So you're looking at one point 8 trillion.

278
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.953
It's a lot of money.

279
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:37.760
Uh,

280
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.170
but it's actually manageable.

281
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:45.150
And one of the things that I haven't heard discussed here with you is that when

282
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:46.650
you put money into people's hands,

283
00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:47.940
the money doesn't disappear.

284
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.490
Like if I gave you 1000 bucks a month,

285
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.070
it probably would not make a big difference in the economy because they're just

286
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.010
go into your account somewhere and you know nothing would happen.

287
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.360
But we all know that right now most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.

288
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.950
57% of Americans can't afford an unexpected $500 bill.

289
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.650
So you put $1,000 a month and then their hands,

290
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.330
it's going to go right back into the economy.

291
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.310
They're going to spend it on food,

292
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.413
childcare,

293
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.750
car repairs have been putting off the occasional night out,

294
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.050
and then all of those businesses end up hiring more people.

295
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:22.380
And then we ended up getting some of the money back as tax revenues.

296
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.730
So of the one point 8 trillion we're going to get back,

297
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.620
let's call it 400 billion in new tax receipts because everyone's going to be

298
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:32.520
spending more money.

299
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.300
We're going to save one to 200 billion on things like incarceration and

300
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:41.400
homelessness services and emergency room healthcare.

301
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.230
I was in New Hampshire last month and a prison guard said to me,

302
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:47.064
there's a prison guard.

303
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.001
He said,

304
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:51.600
we should pay people to stay out of jail because we waste so much money when

305
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:52.434
they're in jail.

306
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.140
Like he sees all the waste in the system.

307
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.830
So if you imagine a society where everyone's getting a thousand bucks a month,

308
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.240
that's like a,

309
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.920
it's a great incentive to try and stay out of jail because you know,

310
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.040
you stopped getting it if you wind up in jail,

311
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.000
uh,

312
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.670
and it reduces recidivism because when you come out of jail,

313
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:09.300
at least you have,

314
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.540
you know,

315
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.110
1000 bucks a month waiting for you and then you're less inclined to,

316
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.920
to commit a crime and head back in.

317
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.870
How much crime do you think you would actually prevent though,

318
00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:17.430
by giving people $1,000 a month?

319
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:17.940
Let me think.

320
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.520
Most of the people that are doing crime,

321
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.750
whether it's thieve,

322
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.630
thievery or assault,

323
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.340
they're not thinking this out.

324
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:27.090
You know,

325
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:27.481
this is,

326
00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:30.210
this is just either a way of life for them either,

327
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.690
you know,

328
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.523
they're,

329
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.810
they've got real mental issues or a pattern of behavior that they can't break.

330
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.230
I'm really don't think that $1,000 a month it's going to fix any of that.

331
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.610
How's that going to fix all of it?

332
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:42.150
For sure.

333
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.351
I mean,

334
00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:43.290
we'll still have jails.

335
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.213
It's not like,

336
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.671
you know,

337
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:45.504
silver bullet,

338
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:51.170
but at the margins would it keep like that person who's falling through the

339
00:11:51.361 --> 00:11:55.150
cracks and feels like they have no place society and maybe they,

340
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:55.391
you know,

341
00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:57.100
it's like the people around them are also like,

342
00:11:57.101 --> 00:11:57.431
hey,

343
00:11:57.431 --> 00:11:57.690
you know,

344
00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.340
you don't have any value and then you get 1000 bucks a month maybe.

345
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.540
Like it keeps them off at the margins and everything we're talking about is at

346
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:05.141
the margins.

347
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:05.321
I mean,

348
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:09.280
everything's like this statistical curve and you're taking the people who are,

349
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:14.281
let's call it like the last 10 to 20% but if you reduce our incarcerated

350
00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:16.270
population by 10 to 20%,

351
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.370
I mean that's billions and billions of dollars.

352
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.780
So you,

353
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.690
you're saving money on a bunch of things.

354
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.940
We spend about a trillion dollars on right now,

355
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:25.750
like healthcare,

356
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.411
incarceration,

357
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:27.340
homelessness services,

358
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.740
and then the,

359
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:33.580
the magic is that if you have 1000 bucks a month and you're a parent,

360
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.570
so you feel this,

361
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.140
that studies have shown that your kids are healthier,

362
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.580
better nourished,

363
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.360
more likely to graduate from high school and get further education.

364
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.280
Mental health improves,

365
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.940
uh,

366
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.410
relationships improve.

367
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.180
Domestic violence goes down,

368
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.020
hospital visits go down and your worker productivity goes up.

369
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.770
Mean you're an entrepreneur and CEO.

370
00:12:56.771 --> 00:12:56.981
So,

371
00:12:56.981 --> 00:12:57.401
you know,

372
00:12:57.401 --> 00:12:58.330
when you run a company,

373
00:12:58.331 --> 00:12:59.110
you say,

374
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.430
I'm going to invest in my people.

375
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.300
I'm going to like treat them well and try and train them and give them resources

376
00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:04.691
because you know,

377
00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:07.300
that'll increase your productivity as an organization.

378
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.950
In the public sector,

379
00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:11.560
we have the opposite approach where like,

380
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:15.820
if I can just avoid spending money on you that you know,

381
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:19.480
I'm going to somehow save money when we end up spending that money and very,

382
00:13:19.481 --> 00:13:20.320
very dark,

383
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.430
costly,

384
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.740
counterproductive ways in the backend because they wind up,

385
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:24.551
you know,

386
00:13:24.551 --> 00:13:25.330
uh,

387
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:25.840
uh,

388
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.010
in our institutions and our institutions just spend a,

389
00:13:28.011 --> 00:13:28.990
a truck load of money.

390
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.320
So if you look at the cost savings and the value gains and the economic growth

391
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.040
that actually gets you back about a trillion dollars or the 1.8 this is like the

392
00:13:39.041 --> 00:13:41.560
trickle up economy because none of the money disappears.

393
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.360
It goes right back into the economy.

394
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:48.400
And the way you get the last 800 billion or so is related to what we think is

395
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:50.710
happening with AI and all these advanced technologies.

396
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:56.070
Because if you look at who's going to win with AI and self driving cars and

397
00:13:56.081 --> 00:13:56.914
trucks,

398
00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.040
that the savings from robot trucks are estimated to be $168 billion a year just

399
00:14:02.321 --> 00:14:03.154
from that one thing.

400
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.540
So the problem is that the American public is going to see very little of that

401
00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:08.340
money,

402
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:08.620
uh,

403
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.950
because the winners are going to be the trillion dollar tech companies that are

404
00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:12.191
great.

405
00:14:12.191 --> 00:14:13.540
It just not paying a lot of taxes.

406
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.520
They'll move it through Ireland.

407
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.250
Amazon will say it didn't make any money this quarter.

408
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.750
No reason to pay taxes.

409
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.410
And so what we need to do is we need to put in a new tax that actually gets the

410
00:14:23.411 --> 00:14:26.590
American public a slice of every robot,

411
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:27.520
truck mile,

412
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.020
Amazon transaction,

413
00:14:29.021 --> 00:14:29.890
Facebook ad,

414
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.610
and every other industrialized country already has this tax.

415
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:35.110
It's called a value added tax.

416
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.150
And because our economy is so vast,

417
00:14:37.151 --> 00:14:39.010
at 20 trillion of value added tax,

418
00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:43.420
that even half the European level generates about 800 billion in new revenue and

419
00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:44.620
that gets you all the way there.

420
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.910
So this is much more achievable and affordable than most people think when they

421
00:14:48.911 --> 00:14:51.650
start unpacking how the numbers workout.

422
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.950
So essentially it would be the biggest corporations,

423
00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:59.540
the the companies that gain or that have the largest revenue,

424
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.280
they're going to be paying most of this.

425
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.701
Yeah,

426
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:03.020
but they're going to get some of that money back,

427
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:03.680
obviously,

428
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.660
because one of the things I say to the CEOs,

429
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.990
it's like if everyone in Missouri is getting 1000 bucks,

430
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:09.171
you know,

431
00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:12.230
Amazon's going to see some of that because they're just going to buy more stuff.

432
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.690
That's true for all of the big companies.

433
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:15.980
What I say to CEOs,

434
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:18.230
and I've spoken to groups of dozens of CEOs.

435
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.410
What's really bad for your businesses when people don't have money to spend?

436
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:21.910
What,

437
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.540
what's good for your businesses when they do.

438
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.750
So they're gonna give up some money at the top end,

439
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:28.460
but then there's going to end up getting it back,

440
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.761
uh,

441
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:32.630
when their consumers end up spending a bit more been actually fleshed out.

442
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:35.990
Like the real numbers are the projections of how much they're going to get back.

443
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:36.460
Yeah.

444
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:36.890
Yeah.

445
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:37.460
Like the,

446
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.550
so the Roosevelt Institute study this plan of everyone getting 1000 bucks a

447
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:43.520
month and projected it would create 2 million new jobs,

448
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:44.330
uh,

449
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.090
and grow the economy by eight to 10%.

450
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.630
And then you can model out what that means to each business.

451
00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:54.290
Because in that climate they're going to see a similar uptick in revenues.

452
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.900
Did they factor in all the jobs that are going to be lost?

453
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.880
So one of the things that's a misconception about universal basic income is that

454
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.600
a,

455
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.600
it's somehow we'll like facilitate job loss.

456
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.070
Job losses though,

457
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.530
is the reason for universal basic income in the first place,

458
00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:09.711
right?

459
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:09.880
Yeah,

460
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.100
yeah.

461
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.401
Which way?

462
00:16:10.401 --> 00:16:11.330
In the midst of right now,

463
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:11.871
like right now,

464
00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:12.950
as we're sitting here together,

465
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.630
the labor force participation rate in the United States is 63%,

466
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.570
which is the same levels as El Salvador in the Dominican Republic.

467
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.433
That's right now,

468
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:22.010
like,

469
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:22.843
uh,

470
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.110
94 million or so Americans have left the workforce over the last number of

471
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:27.800
years.

472
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.130
Now,

473
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.230
a lot of that's natural demographics,

474
00:16:30.231 --> 00:16:32.000
a lot of that people in school,

475
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.420
but about 5 million of it is unskilled men who've gotten pushed out in the

476
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:36.254
workforce.

477
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.333
So,

478
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.520
uh,

479
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.001
so again,

480
00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:38.980
this is not like a,

481
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:39.260
you know,

482
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.240
we're going to solve a problem that's coming down the pike.

483
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.940
Like we're actually in the middle of this problem.

484
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:47.090
So if you put 1000 bucks a month into people's hands,

485
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:49.280
it actually grows the economy and creates jobs,

486
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:49.970
uh,

487
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.340
because of more economic activity.

488
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.031
Now,

489
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:55.430
when you say a problem that's coming down the pike,

490
00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:56.030
what,

491
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.940
what are the projections in terms of like the timeline?

492
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.013
Yes.

493
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.100
So,

494
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:01.933
uh,

495
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.170
there are a lot of,

496
00:17:03.171 --> 00:17:05.210
the projections are actually pretty consistent with each other,

497
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.560
which means they're probably right.

498
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.940
So the,

499
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:08.990
uh,

500
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.120
so banes says you're looking at,

501
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:11.420
uh,

502
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.800
between 20 and 30% of jobs subject to automation by 2030,

503
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:17.150
which is pretty soon.

504
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.170
It's like 11 years from now.

505
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.170
Mckinsey says about 25%.

506
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:22.610
Uh,

507
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:23.780
the Obama White House,

508
00:17:23.781 --> 00:17:26.390
literally I think their last day in office they issued a report saying,

509
00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:27.224
hey guys,

510
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.430
we're going to automate away all the jobs and then like,

511
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.050
you know,

512
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:30.883
turn the lights off.

513
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.580
Um,

514
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.570
they said 83% of jobs that make less than $20 an hour will be subject to

515
00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:37.610
automation by 2030.

516
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.980
Mit is saying the same thing.

517
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:40.761
Uh,

518
00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:45.761
and so we have 11 years to try and accelerate meaningful solutions and this 11

519
00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:47.661
years,

520
00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:49.070
it's not like it all happens on 20.

521
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.880
It's going to happen between now and then progressively according to all of the

522
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:55.380
major institutions that have looked at this.

523
00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:00.020
<v 2>Now when you take a guy who's working as a truck driver and he's making $50,000</v>

524
00:18:00.021 --> 00:18:03.530
a year and you tell him that automation is going to take away his job,

525
00:18:03.531 --> 00:18:04.370
but good news,

526
00:18:04.371 --> 00:18:06.170
we're going to give you $12,000 a year.

527
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:11.160
That's a substantial loss in income and it leaves them in.

528
00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:11.720
Yeah.

529
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.720
It also leaves them with his feeling of uselessness or hopelessness that they're

530
00:18:16.761 --> 00:18:17.541
not contributing.

531
00:18:17.541 --> 00:18:17.751
You know,

532
00:18:17.751 --> 00:18:22.751
I think one of the things that people enjoy is a earning their own way.

533
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.481
You know,

534
00:18:23.481 --> 00:18:23.720
they,

535
00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.230
they,

536
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.063
people don't,

537
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.810
it sounds counterintuitive.

538
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.220
People don't like free money.

539
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.070
They'd like a feeling of satisfaction of a job.

540
00:18:31.071 --> 00:18:34.040
Well done that they've created something that they've done something right.

541
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:34.831
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

542
00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:35.760
You're 100% right.

543
00:18:35.761 --> 00:18:38.100
It's one reason why we call this the freedom dividend.

544
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:38.791
We say,

545
00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:39.570
look,

546
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.500
it's not money for nothing.

547
00:18:40.501 --> 00:18:44.190
You're an owner and chair holder of the richest country in the history of the

548
00:18:44.191 --> 00:18:44.550
world.

549
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.670
Just like when I buy Verizon or Microsoft,

550
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:48.840
they send me a dividend.

551
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.550
Like I don't complain about that.

552
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:55.290
Like your now a shareholder in this great nation and you get a dividend.

553
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.300
But when I was with Dennis,

554
00:18:57.301 --> 00:19:00.420
the trucker who owns his own trucking company in Iowa,

555
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.100
uh,

556
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:02.933
the,

557
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.400
the role that job's playing in trucker is lives is vital.

558
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.271
And again,

559
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:14.271
I'm a very data driven guy where men deal with joblessness is very,

560
00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:15.414
very poorly.

561
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.960
By the numbers we spend between 40 and 75% of our time on the computer playing

562
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:22.830
video games or doing other things.

563
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.080
Uh,

564
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.130
we are substance abuse goes up,

565
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.170
are volunteering in the community,

566
00:19:28.171 --> 00:19:28.711
goes down,

567
00:19:28.711 --> 00:19:33.711
even though we have more time and we generally spiral into antisocial and self

568
00:19:34.021 --> 00:19:34.920
destructive behaviors.

569
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.790
Now this is not something that's uh,

570
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.790
experienced by women in the same levels like women and joblessness.

571
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.440
Women actually a more adaptable,

572
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.860
they're more likely to go back to school and volunteer.

573
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:49.500
They don't spend all their time on the computer is the way that we do.

574
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.660
So there's a real problem.

575
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.320
Uh,

576
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:57.320
and the purpose of universal basic income is not meant to be a job replacement

577
00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.350
for those truckers because right now those truckers,

578
00:20:01.351 --> 00:20:02.720
and when I talked to the truck drivers,

579
00:20:02.721 --> 00:20:05.700
so I've been campaigning for president now for a number of months.

580
00:20:05.701 --> 00:20:06.960
So I spent a lot of time in Iowa,

581
00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:08.670
which is a really huge trucking hub.

582
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:10.350
And you go to them and say,

583
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:10.741
hey guys,

584
00:20:10.741 --> 00:20:12.450
you worried about robot trucks taking your jobs?

585
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.930
They're like,

586
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.940
there's no way a robot could take my job like that.

587
00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:15.330
That's,

588
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:15.610
you know,

589
00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:16.890
that's like totally matter of fact,

590
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.281
they're like,

591
00:20:17.281 --> 00:20:17.851
they're like,

592
00:20:17.851 --> 00:20:19.950
this is not something that they worry about.

593
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:25.070
Their attitude has transitioned from that somewhat too.

594
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:25.950
Uh,

595
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.280
we should make robot trucks illegal or we should make it so that a robot truck

596
00:20:29.281 --> 00:20:31.080
cannot displace me.

597
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.980
So that's been a big shift because a year ago they were like,

598
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.293
it's impossible.

599
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:42.490
<v 2>The idea that an American would say we should make a robot job illegal.</v>

600
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:44.443
Like it's,

601
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.480
we should have some laws that keep you from being free to use robots for your

602
00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:52.480
business instead of person.

603
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:56.500
Like you should be forced to highly mandatory unionization or something.

604
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.970
That sounds pretty ridiculous.

605
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.521
<v 1>Well,</v>

606
00:20:58.521 --> 00:21:00.360
that's where a lot of the Marjoe uh,

607
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.990
so only 13% of truckers are unionized.

608
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:07.220
So 87% are like Dennis where there are small independent firms.

609
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:09.260
And a lot of them actually,

610
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.130
uh,

611
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.570
bought or leased their own trucks.

612
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:12.400
Uh,

613
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.950
so they took out tens of thousands of dollars in the equivalent of a mortgage to

614
00:21:15.951 --> 00:21:16.940
get this truck.

615
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.090
And so if they have to compete against a robot truck,

616
00:21:20.091 --> 00:21:21.050
that doesn't stop,

617
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.113
that's like,

618
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:22.821
you know,

619
00:21:22.821 --> 00:21:25.040
that's existential level stuff.

620
00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:29.840
And right now truck drivers have time use regulations where they cannot drive

621
00:21:29.841 --> 00:21:31.400
more than 14 hours a day.

622
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:32.270
Uh,

623
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.050
so you can't,

624
00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.920
you literally cannot compete because the robot trucks just going to keep going.

625
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.671
Our 15,

626
00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:38.031
16,

627
00:21:38.031 --> 00:21:39.770
17 et cetera.

628
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.140
So these guys make,

629
00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.460
some of them make really good money.

630
00:21:43.461 --> 00:21:44.420
Like some of them make 70,

631
00:21:44.421 --> 00:21:45.830
75 $80,000.

632
00:21:45.831 --> 00:21:47.660
It's one of the higher paying jobs for,

633
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:48.953
uh,

634
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.470
men without a college degree.

635
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.320
And so if you look at what they're facing,

636
00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.390
it's not so crazy that they're like,

637
00:21:56.391 --> 00:21:57.050
hey,

638
00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:00.560
you need to make the robots illegal because for them,

639
00:22:00.561 --> 00:22:05.060
what is the next best economic alternative if the robot trucks take over that

640
00:22:05.061 --> 00:22:05.510
job?

641
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:06.470
Like what sound go for it.

642
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:06.701
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

643
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:07.900
It's not crazy for them,

644
00:22:07.901 --> 00:22:11.530
but it's a crazy idea to tell a company that they can't do something that's more

645
00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:12.220
efficient,

646
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.053
safer,

647
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.790
and probably economically more viable.

648
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.291
<v 1>Oh yeah.</v>

649
00:22:16.291 --> 00:22:16.651
Again,

650
00:22:16.651 --> 00:22:21.651
the savings from automating truck driving are estimated to be $168 billion per

651
00:22:22.771 --> 00:22:23.580
year.

652
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.540
And not just labor savings but also equipment utilization because the trucks

653
00:22:27.541 --> 00:22:30.960
never stop fuel efficiency because the trucks can daisy chain together.

654
00:22:30.961 --> 00:22:35.961
So there's less wind resistance you accidents cause right now truck accidents

655
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.330
kill about 4,000 people a year so you'd probably save lives.

656
00:22:39.331 --> 00:22:39.811
There's a very,

657
00:22:39.811 --> 00:22:43.830
very powerful argument for the fact that we should be trying to automate this

658
00:22:43.831 --> 00:22:44.664
stuff.

659
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.150
But on the other side you have literally three and a half million truckers who

660
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.250
rely upon this for their livelihoods to support their family and there's going

661
00:22:52.251 --> 00:22:54.180
to be a lot of passion,

662
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.560
a lot of resistance to this.

663
00:22:55.561 --> 00:22:57.930
Anyone who thinks the truck drivers are just going to shrug and be like,

664
00:22:57.931 --> 00:22:58.440
all right,

665
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.210
I guess I had a good run.

666
00:23:00.211 --> 00:23:01.680
I'm just going to go home and figure it out.

667
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.390
That's not going to be their response.

668
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:03.780
Right.

669
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.810
It's going to be much more likely that they say you need to make these robot

670
00:23:06.811 --> 00:23:10.770
trucks illegal or they're just going to park their trucks across the highway,

671
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:11.910
get their guns out.

672
00:23:11.911 --> 00:23:14.220
Cause a lot of these guys are ex military and just be like,

673
00:23:14.221 --> 00:23:15.000
Hey,

674
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.830
like I'm not moving my truck until uh,

675
00:23:16.831 --> 00:23:17.250
you know,

676
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.460
I get my job back and that there'll be a lot of truckers in the same situation.

677
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:21.840
You really think that would happen?

678
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.513
Well I think

679
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.770
<v 2>the highway for their job back that's less efficient,</v>

680
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.030
kills more people.

681
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.770
<v 1>So I was with these truckers in the truck stop in Altoona,</v>

682
00:23:31.771 --> 00:23:33.420
Iowa and Joe,

683
00:23:33.421 --> 00:23:34.111
they have really,

684
00:23:34.111 --> 00:23:35.790
really difficult jobs.

685
00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:36.031
I mean,

686
00:23:36.031 --> 00:23:38.100
I don't know if you knew truckers where you were,

687
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:42.480
but they have this 14 hour window where they're allowed to drive their truck and

688
00:23:42.481 --> 00:23:43.350
they drive most of that.

689
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.340
So they have these other 10 hours and they sleep in their truck.

690
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.510
Two trucks have a bed,

691
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.370
they go into the truck stop,

692
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.540
they take a shower,

693
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.100
you know,

694
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:56.100
there's a laundry and they're like plugged into this machine of this truck and

695
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:57.973
the industry,

696
00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:58.551
you know,

697
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:00.020
they spend days,

698
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:02.090
sometimes weeks on the road.

699
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.620
<v 2>A lot of them listened to podcasts.</v>

700
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.330
Probably a lot of them listening right now.

701
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.060
<v 1>A lot of them listened to podcasts and,</v>

702
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.870
uh,

703
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.890
they're doing it primarily because it's a more lucrative opportunity than the

704
00:24:12.891 --> 00:24:14.810
other jobs that are available to them.

705
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.360
A lot of them have families that like,

706
00:24:16.361 --> 00:24:16.760
you know,

707
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.170
like the supporting their families.

708
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:19.011
Uh,

709
00:24:19.011 --> 00:24:20.750
and so if you say,

710
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:21.381
hey guys,

711
00:24:21.381 --> 00:24:21.920
like,

712
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.221
you know,

713
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:23.810
Time's up for,

714
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.550
for this way of life.

715
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.880
Most of them I think will not like,

716
00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:29.090
uh,

717
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.760
like I actually,

718
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.400
I look at how much they frankly,

719
00:24:31.401 --> 00:24:32.700
they like into your,

720
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:37.670
there's so much endurance baked into that job that I think most of them will be

721
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.940
like some of the guys you and I know where they're much more likely to like

722
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.530
implode or like,

723
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:43.280
you know,

724
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.360
do something where,

725
00:24:44.361 --> 00:24:48.600
where it's self destructive than they would be to take their truck,

726
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:49.280
you know,

727
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.360
park it across the highway.

728
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:54.110
But you're talking about a population of hundreds of thousands,

729
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.430
including many small business owners and small business owners have a different

730
00:24:58.431 --> 00:25:00.170
mentality very often.

731
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:00.591
Like,

732
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:01.640
I've been an entrepreneur,

733
00:25:01.641 --> 00:25:03.890
I'm a serial entrepreneur for the last 20 years.

734
00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:06.440
Like you're an entrepreneur and if you saw this happen,

735
00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:07.071
you might say,

736
00:25:07.071 --> 00:25:07.790
Hey,

737
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:08.541
I'm adaptable.

738
00:25:08.541 --> 00:25:09.410
I'll figure it out.

739
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:10.190
Um,

740
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:11.120
or you might say,

741
00:25:11.121 --> 00:25:11.954
Hey,

742
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.390
I think I can do something about this.

743
00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.180
Like if I parked my truck this way,

744
00:25:17.181 --> 00:25:20.240
like that's going to cause such havoc that it's,

745
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:20.691
you know,

746
00:25:20.691 --> 00:25:24.860
it's like hundreds of millions of dollars worth of economic harm very,

747
00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:25.694
very fast.

748
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.970
And if you look at the industrial revolution,

749
00:25:28.971 --> 00:25:31.670
which people cite as the precursor to what we're going through,

750
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.770
there were mass riots in the industrial revolution that killed dozens of people,

751
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.750
caused billions of dollars worth of damage.

752
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.050
Labor Day's a holiday today because of those riots.

753
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:47.750
And then we implemented universal high school in 1911 and part as a response to

754
00:25:47.751 --> 00:25:48.584
these riots.

755
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.810
So according to the estimates,

756
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:54.740
this is called the fourth industrial revolution and we're going to displace jobs

757
00:25:54.741 --> 00:25:58.370
at three to four times the rate of that industrial revolution.

758
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.510
And that industrial revolution included mass riots.

759
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:06.890
So thinking that this one will not strikes me as really,

760
00:26:06.891 --> 00:26:09.620
really optimistic and perhaps unrealistic.

761
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.753
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

762
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.040
What do you see coming when,

763
00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:13.970
when you,

764
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:18.530
when you think that these jobs are going to be automated and then universal

765
00:26:18.531 --> 00:26:21.440
basic income is going to supplement their in,

766
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.030
it's going to give them some money,

767
00:26:23.031 --> 00:26:24.140
$1,000 a month,

768
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.240
but where do they go from there?

769
00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:26.600
I mean,

770
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.970
how do people exist on $12,000 a year?

771
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.110
Like what do they do?

772
00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.180
Like how do they adapt to this new world?

773
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.320
<v 1>Right?</v>

774
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.470
So the first thing you have to do is you have to look at what lies ahead if we

775
00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:37.190
do nothing,

776
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.690
right?

777
00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:37.970
Uh,

778
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:38.541
so the,

779
00:26:38.541 --> 00:26:42.890
the way it's going to play out is that self driving trucks are slowly going to

780
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.733
start Hamal highways.

781
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.810
Amazon's testing them out right now and the first age is going to be that there

782
00:26:47.811 --> 00:26:50.490
is a human driver just sitting there as a fail safe and the truck's going to

783
00:26:50.491 --> 00:26:51.324
drive itself.

784
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.290
Uh,

785
00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:56.310
now my friends in Silicon Valley are working on tele operators,

786
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:57.690
which is,

787
00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.010
so the trucks have right now,

788
00:26:59.011 --> 00:27:01.770
like a 98% accuracy level,

789
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.390
which is not very high because you can't have 2% semi trucks like running into

790
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.340
things like go,

791
00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:07.570
go,

792
00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:07.830
go,

793
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.120
go the roads.

794
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:09.820
So,

795
00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.250
so the way they're trying to get the last percenter.

796
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.750
So is there equipping trucks with tele operating software,

797
00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:17.610
which means that a trucker,

798
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.160
a tele operator in Nevada or Arizona,

799
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.650
we'll beam into the truck and just be able to see out the front,

800
00:27:22.651 --> 00:27:23.484
like a video game,

801
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:24.510
uh,

802
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.220
like uh,

803
00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:25.410
let,

804
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:26.490
you know it's like drone operating,

805
00:27:26.491 --> 00:27:30.870
but instead of the truck and you beam in and then you just steer the truck until

806
00:27:30.871 --> 00:27:31.390
the computers.

807
00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:32.880
Like I got it from here and then you beam out.

808
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:37.530
That's what they're working on to try and catch that last bit of uncertainty.

809
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:38.580
Uh,

810
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.500
so the innovations are happening and again,

811
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:40.651
Joe,

812
00:27:40.651 --> 00:27:42.630
we're talking about $168 billion a year.

813
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.220
Like everything becomes possible when you're looking at that much money.

814
00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.920
So in the absence of anyone doing anything,

815
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:54.510
the robot trucks will start reducing shifts of various truckers.

816
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.660
I would say six to 10 years from now.

817
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.060
And so then there'll be a bunch of reactions.

818
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:01.140
Now,

819
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.860
trucking firms already have massive shortages.

820
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:06.420
They can't find enough people.

821
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:10.830
That's one reason why they're trying to automate this job as fast as they are

822
00:28:10.831 --> 00:28:12.270
because they're literally like,

823
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.260
you know,

824
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.380
they're short like a couple of hundred thousand truckers right now.

825
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.800
And people don't want to go into this field for a variety of reasons.

826
00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:20.581
The main thing being,

827
00:28:20.581 --> 00:28:22.620
it's like extraordinarily brutal on new,

828
00:28:22.621 --> 00:28:24.000
physically very,

829
00:28:24.001 --> 00:28:25.620
very bad for your family life too,

830
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:26.970
because you're away all the time.

831
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:27.833
Yeah.

832
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:28.410
Uh,

833
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:32.790
something like 88% of truckers have an early marker for chronic disease,

834
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:33.630
like,

835
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:34.220
oh,

836
00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.250
like substance abuse,

837
00:28:35.251 --> 00:28:36.090
diabetes,

838
00:28:36.091 --> 00:28:36.511
obesity,

839
00:28:36.511 --> 00:28:38.460
high blood pressure or something along those lines.

840
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.520
And now people think that the jobs going to disappear in the next five to 10

841
00:28:41.521 --> 00:28:41.730
years.

842
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:42.600
You can't get people in.

843
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:44.970
So if you play out,

844
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:48.150
what happens when the robot trucks start reducing shifts,

845
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.540
then there'll be people trying to flee the field of trucking.

846
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.620
And then if it becomes really dramatic where the robot start driving,

847
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:58.920
let's say between western Pennsylvania and Nevada,

848
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.090
and then human beings get in in those states and then take it the rest of the

849
00:29:03.091 --> 00:29:07.260
way because the robots won't be reliable enough to drive an urban areas.

850
00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:10.740
There'll be reliable enough to drive on an interstate or they just have to make

851
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:11.820
a few decisions.

852
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:13.200
Uh,

853
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.460
then there'll be a massive depletion of truck driving opportunities.

854
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.590
And then in my mind,

855
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.120
a lot of suicides,

856
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.190
a lot of,

857
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.500
uh,

858
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.370
self destruction.

859
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.630
And I don't say that lightly.

860
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.600
I say that based upon the fact that that's what happened in the manufacturing

861
00:29:27.601 --> 00:29:31.140
workers where if you unpack what happened to the manufacturing workers of

862
00:29:31.141 --> 00:29:31.621
Michigan,

863
00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:32.454
Ohio,

864
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:33.983
Indiana,

865
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:38.520
suicide rates spiked to a point where now our life expectancy as a country has

866
00:29:38.521 --> 00:29:42.340
declined for the last three years because of suicide and drug overdoses.

867
00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:42.940
Uh,

868
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:47.560
it's the first time that's happened since the great flu pandemic of 1918 like,

869
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:50.830
we are actually coming apart as a country by the numbers.

870
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.580
So what happened to the manufacturer?

871
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.690
It grows will then happen to the truckers,

872
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.533
but at a,

873
00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.430
an even more dramatic scale.

874
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:02.050
So you'll see truckers going home and drinking themselves to death or,

875
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:02.530
uh,

876
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:05.560
doing drugs and overdosing or killing themselves.

877
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:06.370
Uh,

878
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:10.450
and then eventually there'll be an outbreak of violence because some truckers

879
00:30:10.451 --> 00:30:10.721
will say,

880
00:30:10.721 --> 00:30:11.740
and so killing myself,

881
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:13.600
how about I go bust up a robot truck?

882
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.410
Uh,

883
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:18.670
and there are already truckers that are doing things like blocking Tesla

884
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:20.950
recharging stations and electronic vehicle,

885
00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.310
a battery stations because they don't like electronic trucks.

886
00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.160
<v 2>Sure.</v>

887
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:25.500
Dah.

888
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.880
Those are pickup trucks though.

889
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:27.990
Those are assholes.

890
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:28.920
I mean,

891
00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.990
this is not like people doing it because they,

892
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.410
they think that these Tesla recharge stations are taking jobs away.

893
00:30:34.411 --> 00:30:35.550
They're just being dickheads.

894
00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.651
<v 1>Exactly.</v>

895
00:30:36.651 --> 00:30:37.280
Joe.

896
00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.380
So if you're going to be a dickhead,

897
00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.660
even though it really has nothing to do with you,

898
00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:45.080
imagine when you actually think your livelihood is being threatened.

899
00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:45.380
Right.

900
00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:45.830
Good point.

901
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:47.720
Then you can see it getting revved up,

902
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:48.291
you know,

903
00:30:48.291 --> 00:30:49.730
to like a much higher level.

904
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:50.390
Yeah.

905
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:51.223
So,

906
00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.770
so I'm running for president in large part because I think we need to get in

907
00:30:54.771 --> 00:30:56.030
front of this set of problems.

908
00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.201
We have to say,

909
00:30:57.201 --> 00:30:57.830
look,

910
00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.680
if we're going to save $168 billion a year,

911
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.520
maybe some of that should go to the truckers and give them a soft landing.

912
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.690
Maybe we should have this universal basic income where everyone feels like

913
00:31:08.691 --> 00:31:09.950
they're getting 1000 bucks a month,

914
00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:11.320
which is not a work replacement.

915
00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.160
It's not going to make their lives easy.

916
00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.480
They still need to work,

917
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:16.640
but at least it takes the edge off.

918
00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.160
It takes like the existential threat off.

919
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:19.900
Um,

920
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.170
and also their kids getting it.

921
00:31:21.171 --> 00:31:21.681
So they feel like,

922
00:31:21.681 --> 00:31:21.981
okay,

923
00:31:21.981 --> 00:31:24.200
my kid actually has some kind of path to the future.

924
00:31:24.201 --> 00:31:26.720
And it's not like if I lose this trucking job,

925
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.640
not only am I going to,

926
00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:29.420
you know,

927
00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.320
struggle and suffer,

928
00:31:30.321 --> 00:31:31.370
but my kid will too.

929
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:32.450
So,

930
00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:33.110
uh,

931
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:35.920
my plan as president is to install a trucker.

932
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:37.970
Transitions are and say,

933
00:31:37.971 --> 00:31:38.600
look,

934
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.020
it is your job to try and manage this transition for the three and a half

935
00:31:42.021 --> 00:31:42.854
million truckers.

936
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:43.551
And Joe,

937
00:31:43.551 --> 00:31:48.170
we haven't even talked about the 5 million Americans who work at truck stops,

938
00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.550
motels,

939
00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:50.990
diners,

940
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:55.640
retail establishment is all the places where the truckers stop every day just to

941
00:31:55.641 --> 00:31:56.180
get out,

942
00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:56.961
eat a meal.

943
00:31:56.961 --> 00:31:57.471
And you know,

944
00:31:57.471 --> 00:31:59.510
like live a life mean.

945
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.030
If you imagine those communities,

946
00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:03.800
when the trucks don't stop,

947
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:08.750
there's going to be a drying up of economic vitality on a level that's

948
00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.640
unprecedented in many of these communities.

949
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.700
This is something that I,

950
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.350
<v 2>I'm just becoming aware of over the last year or two.</v>

951
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:16.220
Um,

952
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:16.761
how,

953
00:32:16.761 --> 00:32:19.820
when when you were out on the campaign trail and you know,

954
00:32:19.821 --> 00:32:22.340
you're talking to media and you're discussing this with people,

955
00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.030
how many people have no idea that this is coming?

956
00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:27.111
<v 1>Well,</v>

957
00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:27.921
what I say to people,

958
00:32:27.921 --> 00:32:28.161
Joe,

959
00:32:28.161 --> 00:32:28.551
is I say,

960
00:32:28.551 --> 00:32:28.731
Hey,

961
00:32:28.731 --> 00:32:30.710
have you noticed stores closing on your main street?

962
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.360
And then they say yes.

963
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.860
And then I asked them why is that?

964
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.800
And then they reflect for a minute and then they say Amazon.

965
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:37.131
And I'm like,

966
00:32:37.131 --> 00:32:37.281
yeah,

967
00:32:37.281 --> 00:32:38.114
that's right.

968
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:43.680
It was getting $20 billion of commerce every year and it's now tipping your

969
00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.500
malls and main street stories into oblivion.

970
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.780
And like is that going to get better or worse?

971
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.660
Cause so some people say it's like how the robots,

972
00:32:50.661 --> 00:32:52.460
like the robots are years away and then you're like,

973
00:32:52.461 --> 00:32:52.641
no,

974
00:32:52.641 --> 00:32:55.610
it's not robots actually like walking around your neighborhood.

975
00:32:55.611 --> 00:32:57.230
I mean of course that's unlikely.

976
00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:01.490
But Amazon soaking up the business that used to go to your mall,

977
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.890
if you go to their fulfillment center,

978
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.970
it's robots as far as the eye can see if you go to their uh,

979
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:09.470
their warehouse,

980
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:09.801
you know,

981
00:33:09.801 --> 00:33:11.960
it's also robots as far as far as the eye can see.

982
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.680
So when you ask how aware are people that this is happening,

983
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.560
it's one of those truths that as soon as you pointed out,

984
00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.370
they're like,

985
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:19.940
oh yeah,

986
00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.291
like I,

987
00:33:20.291 --> 00:33:23.540
I knew that was what was up is just for whatever reason,

988
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.870
I'm like the only person just laying out the facts and being like,

989
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:27.704
guys,

990
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.240
it's not your imagination.

991
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:34.130
Like we actually are getting rid of the most common jobs in the U s economy

992
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:38.330
filled by high school graduates and then replacing them with a handful of jobs

993
00:33:38.331 --> 00:33:41.090
for higher skilled people in different places.

994
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:46.040
And then we're pretending that the first population is somehow going to access

995
00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:50.540
the new opportunities when the odds of them getting up and moving to Seattle or

996
00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:55.541
whatnot and becoming a web designer or like logistics manager or a big data

997
00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:59.570
scientist or something like essentially near zero.

998
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:04.100
And so this is what gave rise to a lot of the anger that got Donald Trump

999
00:34:04.101 --> 00:34:06.500
elected because they looked around their communities and we're like,

1000
00:34:06.501 --> 00:34:07.334
hey,

1001
00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.020
I used to work in this manufacturing plant.

1002
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.590
This manufacturing plant no longer exists for whatever reason.

1003
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.850
Like I'm being told that it's somehow like my fault that I wasn't adaptable

1004
00:34:16.851 --> 00:34:17.300
enough.

1005
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.080
Like I didn't,

1006
00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:18.913
you know,

1007
00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.980
I didn't somehow become a coder or something ridiculous and not to say Joe,

1008
00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:28.220
and this is something that I've picked up from Dennis and part.

1009
00:34:28.221 --> 00:34:30.650
So I'm with this trucker in Iowa and he says to me,

1010
00:34:30.651 --> 00:34:32.030
he says like,

1011
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.880
I don't think that Democrats care about people like me.

1012
00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:35.660
Uh,

1013
00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:38.870
and he says that to me while I'm in his truck and I'm just like,

1014
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:40.820
I can understand why he feels that way.

1015
00:34:40.821 --> 00:34:45.821
But that's incredibly destructive because there is a point at which Democratic

1016
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.541
Party used to be very,

1017
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:51.020
very heavily aligned with working class Americans.

1018
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:56.500
And there's now some kind of a pathology that if the person who's suffering is a

1019
00:34:56.991 --> 00:34:59.480
white man of a certain background,

1020
00:34:59.481 --> 00:35:02.630
then the suffering somehow is like somehow like diminished.

1021
00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.870
Like it doesn't count as much if they're a trucker.

1022
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:06.670
Uh,

1023
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:11.270
and that's something that I find really destructive.

1024
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:15.590
It's like we have to start acknowledging the sources of the problems.

1025
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:16.610
One thing I'm saying to people is like,

1026
00:35:16.611 --> 00:35:16.761
look,

1027
00:35:16.761 --> 00:35:18.650
it's not immigrants that are taking these jobs away.

1028
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:19.970
Like just facts.

1029
00:35:19.971 --> 00:35:20.930
It is not immigrants.

1030
00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:25.880
It is the fact that technology is pushing our economy in a direction that makes

1031
00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:29.300
it harder and harder for many Americans to get by based upon this current,

1032
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:32.060
I trade my time for money model.

1033
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:35.150
Now truckers seemed to be the big one,

1034
00:35:35.151 --> 00:35:35.690
right?

1035
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:36.380
Yeah.

1036
00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.680
Cashiers are another one.

1037
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:38.420
Yeah.

1038
00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:38.850
Um,

1039
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:39.810
what are the other job?

1040
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.680
The jobs that are going to be killed by automation.

1041
00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.240
So the,

1042
00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.160
the next obvious one is call center workers.

1043
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:47.630
Uh,

1044
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.460
of course where there are two and a half million call center worker is still in

1045
00:35:50.461 --> 00:35:51.300
the United States.

1046
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.900
Generally high school graduates,

1047
00:35:52.901 --> 00:35:54.270
they make about $14 an hour.

1048
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.260
Now when you and I call a company were like pounding keys trying to get a human

1049
00:35:58.261 --> 00:36:00.360
because the AI is so annoying.

1050
00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:00.840
Yeah.

1051
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.140
You know,

1052
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.531
it's like,

1053
00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:01.831
Hey,

1054
00:36:01.831 --> 00:36:02.281
but you know,

1055
00:36:02.281 --> 00:36:03.450
just like gimme gimme a person.

1056
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:04.560
Yeah.

1057
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.390
But over the next number of months,

1058
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.690
AI is going to become industry indistinguishable from a person.

1059
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:09.861
Yeah.

1060
00:36:09.861 --> 00:36:13.710
Like the new Google answering service that comes with the pixel phones.

1061
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.490
It's amazing.

1062
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:15.323
Yes.

1063
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.740
And so that two and a half million call center population's gonna shrink a ton

1064
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.410
because after you get AI software,

1065
00:36:22.411 --> 00:36:24.120
that's better than one of them.

1066
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:24.691
You know,

1067
00:36:24.691 --> 00:36:26.430
it can be most all of them.

1068
00:36:26.431 --> 00:36:26.670
You know,

1069
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.110
that's not like 5,000 jobs.

1070
00:36:28.111 --> 00:36:30.340
That's potentially 500,000 jobs.

1071
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:36.060
I was at a conference of CEOs and I asked how many of them are looking at having

1072
00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:39.840
AI replace back office workers like various clerical functions.

1073
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.400
Every single hand went up.

1074
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.080
There's going to be a lot of

1075
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.840
clerical work,

1076
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.780
having systems talk to each other that's going to disappear.

1077
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:54.110
And one CIO type of like a major bank said that his estimate was,

1078
00:36:55.141 --> 00:36:58.860
adds about 30% of the bank's workers fall into that category.

1079
00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.720
So you're looking at call center workers,

1080
00:37:00.721 --> 00:37:02.280
you're looking at back office workers,

1081
00:37:02.281 --> 00:37:03.930
you're looking at insurance brokers.

1082
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.980
Insurance is a very highly automateable industry cause it's a lot of information

1083
00:37:07.981 --> 00:37:09.150
getting passed back and forth.

1084
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:10.261
Cashiers,

1085
00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:11.094
as you said,

1086
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.360
truck drivers,

1087
00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:13.320
delivery drivers,

1088
00:37:13.321 --> 00:37:14.220
Uber drivers.

1089
00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.153
Uh,

1090
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:17.700
it goes even as far as medical procedures.

1091
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:19.890
There was a recent automated,

1092
00:37:19.891 --> 00:37:22.920
a medical procedure where they did surgery on a grape.

1093
00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:23.730
Yes.

1094
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:23.880
Yeah.

1095
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.540
You see that?

1096
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:24.781
Yeah,

1097
00:37:24.781 --> 00:37:25.531
I saw that.

1098
00:37:25.531 --> 00:37:30.531
And China's already had just a complete automated dental implantation because

1099
00:37:30.961 --> 00:37:33.750
China actually has a real shortage of surgeons.

1100
00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:37.350
And so their incentives to try and automate this are very,

1101
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:38.184
very high.

1102
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.810
Now the interesting thing here,

1103
00:37:39.811 --> 00:37:40.051
Joe,

1104
00:37:40.051 --> 00:37:42.780
is that let's say I made a robot surgeon tomorrow that was awesome,

1105
00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:44.460
could do better work than a lot of people.

1106
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.480
Right now the economic incentives still are not necessarily for everyone to use.

1107
00:37:48.481 --> 00:37:53.220
My robot surgeon because the regulations aren't there yet in the u s and so

1108
00:37:53.221 --> 00:37:54.810
healthcare is a really interesting one.

1109
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.960
Another one that's very clearly going to get taken up by Ai is radiology and

1110
00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:01.560
looking at tumors on a film,

1111
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:06.330
because it turns out that AI can see shades of gray that a human eye cannot.

1112
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.070
And it can reference millions of films where the most experienced doctor can

1113
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:12.240
probably reference thousands.

1114
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.370
And so radiology,

1115
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.270
I'll tell you,

1116
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:18.600
medical students are running from radiology as fast as they can because they

1117
00:38:18.601 --> 00:38:21.480
know that's gonna get taken up by AI.

1118
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:22.110
Man,

1119
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.900
this is such a bleak forecast.

1120
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.050
It's very strange when we stop and think about all the different things that

1121
00:38:28.051 --> 00:38:31.830
human beings find value in as far as their occupation.

1122
00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:32.041
Like,

1123
00:38:32.041 --> 00:38:32.371
Hey,

1124
00:38:32.371 --> 00:38:33.031
I'm a this,

1125
00:38:33.031 --> 00:38:33.551
I'm a that.

1126
00:38:33.551 --> 00:38:34.384
This is what I do.

1127
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.970
And that the idea that these things are all gonna go away,

1128
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:37.661
it's very,

1129
00:38:37.661 --> 00:38:38.680
it's kind of disturbing.

1130
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.021
Oh,

1131
00:38:39.021 --> 00:38:39.161
it.

1132
00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:40.870
And when I was digging into the research show,

1133
00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:42.850
it's been happening and it's tearing us apart.

1134
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:43.331
I mean,

1135
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:44.590
I referenced the fact that,

1136
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.260
so here's some things that are all taught at halt all time.

1137
00:38:47.261 --> 00:38:49.810
Our multi decade highs right now in the United States of America,

1138
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:51.363
suicide,

1139
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:52.850
drug overdoses,

1140
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.593
uh,

1141
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:56.050
anxiety and depression,

1142
00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:57.730
mental problems,

1143
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.450
uh,

1144
00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:59.710
financial insecurity,

1145
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.720
people being unable to pay their bills,

1146
00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:06.160
all of these things are at record highs in one thing I know you've talked about

1147
00:39:06.161 --> 00:39:09.790
in the past that I think you'd really find fascinating.

1148
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.440
So there's been there,

1149
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.530
there've been studies as to what happens to your mind when you can't pay your

1150
00:39:14.531 --> 00:39:15.640
bills and,

1151
00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.110
and when you can't pay your bills,

1152
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:18.310
you're like stressing out.

1153
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.491
It's like,

1154
00:39:18.491 --> 00:39:19.031
if I pay this,

1155
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:19.900
I can't pay that.

1156
00:39:19.901 --> 00:39:20.980
And there's always the time,

1157
00:39:20.981 --> 00:39:21.731
money trade off.

1158
00:39:21.731 --> 00:39:22.001
It's like,

1159
00:39:22.001 --> 00:39:22.061
Oh,

1160
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:23.950
if I spend extra time commuting,

1161
00:39:23.951 --> 00:39:24.441
maybe I can say,

1162
00:39:24.441 --> 00:39:24.651
well,

1163
00:39:24.651 --> 00:39:25.630
a couple of bucks.

1164
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:26.280
Uh,

1165
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.800
and so what it does is it actually constrains your bandwidth to a point that

1166
00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:34.390
your functional Iq goes down by 13 points or one standard deviation.

1167
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.190
So just if you say to someone,

1168
00:39:36.191 --> 00:39:36.491
Hey,

1169
00:39:36.491 --> 00:39:37.630
here's a bill you can't pay.

1170
00:39:37.631 --> 00:39:38.920
And then you give them an Iq test it,

1171
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:42.310
their score actually goes down by 13 points a lot.

1172
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.900
That's like a really huge effect.

1173
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:45.880
And so what we're doing right now,

1174
00:39:45.881 --> 00:39:46.121
Joe,

1175
00:39:46.121 --> 00:39:49.510
is we're actually making our population less rational,

1176
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:50.740
less reasonable,

1177
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.120
more impulsive,

1178
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.130
more subject to bad ideas,

1179
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:55.240
Nastier,

1180
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:58.000
more subject to things like racism and misogyny too,

1181
00:39:58.001 --> 00:40:01.360
because it turns out what happens with most of us is you need executive

1182
00:40:01.361 --> 00:40:04.180
functioning to resist like racist and massage,

1183
00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.740
misogynistic impulses.

1184
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.280
And so if I make you cash strapped and make it so you can't pay your bills,

1185
00:40:09.281 --> 00:40:10.360
you're actually more likely to be like,

1186
00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:11.100
yeah,

1187
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:11.933
yeah.

1188
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:12.370
Like,

1189
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:12.640
yeah,

1190
00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.630
like blame them.

1191
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.860
So what you're,

1192
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:16.930
what we're talking about,

1193
00:40:16.931 --> 00:40:17.231
again,

1194
00:40:17.231 --> 00:40:18.760
it's not this speculative future,

1195
00:40:18.761 --> 00:40:22.300
it's that we've been doing this for years and it's actually pushing our

1196
00:40:22.301 --> 00:40:25.930
population into a mindset of scarcity of nastiness.

1197
00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:30.970
And that's why universal basic income is so crucial because it gets the boot off

1198
00:40:30.971 --> 00:40:35.020
of people's throats and it replaces the mindset of scarcity with a mindset of

1199
00:40:35.021 --> 00:40:40.021
abundance and rationality and optimism and capacity.

1200
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:42.640
Like I'm an entrepreneur.

1201
00:40:42.641 --> 00:40:43.510
You're an entrepreneur.

1202
00:40:43.511 --> 00:40:44.081
I'll tell you,

1203
00:40:44.081 --> 00:40:44.351
very,

1204
00:40:44.351 --> 00:40:48.010
very few entrepreneurs start businesses at a scarcity where they're like,

1205
00:40:48.011 --> 00:40:48.131
oh,

1206
00:40:48.131 --> 00:40:49.030
I can't pay my bills.

1207
00:40:49.031 --> 00:40:50.500
I guess I'm not like starting a new company,

1208
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.180
you know,

1209
00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:51.850
like,

1210
00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:52.720
like most of them.

1211
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:57.100
But $1,000 a month isn't even enough money for most people to pay for the rent.

1212
00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:57.971
Well,

1213
00:40:57.971 --> 00:40:58.571
the great thing is,

1214
00:40:58.571 --> 00:40:58.901
again,

1215
00:40:58.901 --> 00:41:00.940
this thousand dollars is yours no matter what.

1216
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:02.440
So right now,

1217
00:41:02.441 --> 00:41:03.191
let's say you're,

1218
00:41:03.191 --> 00:41:04.720
you're doing a normal job.

1219
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:05.561
Um,

1220
00:41:05.561 --> 00:41:07.060
so if you make $1 million a year,

1221
00:41:07.061 --> 00:41:08.470
he's still got $1,000 a month.

1222
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:08.891
Yes.

1223
00:41:08.891 --> 00:41:09.490
Yes you do.

1224
00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:09.731
I mean,

1225
00:41:09.731 --> 00:41:12.100
it's opt in so you could opt in and take it,

1226
00:41:12.101 --> 00:41:14.620
which most Americans would because it's still 1000 bucks a month.

1227
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:15.400
Yeah.

1228
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.300
People get greedy.

1229
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.871
Yeah.

1230
00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:17.704
For sure.

1231
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.910
Yeah.

1232
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:20.830
Thousand Dollars to get my nails done.

1233
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.023
Yes.

1234
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:23.111
Or give it away.

1235
00:41:23.111 --> 00:41:23.651
If they were they,

1236
00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:23.891
you know,

1237
00:41:23.891 --> 00:41:24.710
they felt like it.

1238
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:25.300
Yeah.

1239
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:25.541
Yeah.

1240
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:26.710
But the,

1241
00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:27.460
this,

1242
00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.190
so those are the things that are at all time highs.

1243
00:41:30.191 --> 00:41:32.650
It's like all these negative social indicators here,

1244
00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:33.680
things that are at all time,

1245
00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:34.514
lows,

1246
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:35.690
<v 0>getting married,</v>

1247
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:37.730
starting a business,

1248
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:39.080
having a kid,

1249
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.180
moving for a new job.

1250
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.350
All of those things are at historic lows in the United States of America having

1251
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:45.890
children.

1252
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:46.370
Really?

1253
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:46.611
Yeah.

1254
00:41:46.611 --> 00:41:50.330
We're at record low birth rates right now and it's largely because people feel

1255
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.070
too strapped to have kids.

1256
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:52.341
I mean,

1257
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:53.360
that's literally where we are.

1258
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.230
When you say record low by like what percentage you can look up right now.

1259
00:41:57.231 --> 00:41:57.600
Jamie,

1260
00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.880
I don't know if you want to look this up.

1261
00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.390
Uh,

1262
00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:03.530
but stories have come out over this last year saying that Americans are now at

1263
00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:05.570
the lowest rate of childbirth.

1264
00:42:05.571 --> 00:42:08.390
That has been the case in decades or ever.

1265
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:08.901
Yeah,

1266
00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:11.540
that's a conversation that I have with people whenever they say that a,

1267
00:42:11.541 --> 00:42:13.040
they're worried about population.

1268
00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.090
The population is growing so fast and overpopulate here it goes.

1269
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.900
1.8 births per woman,

1270
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:23.330
2016 what does that mean?

1271
00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:29.530
So it's dropping from 1970 at a high.

1272
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:31.260
Well,

1273
00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.360
it seems fairly,

1274
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.300
fairly similar from 1980 to today.

1275
00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.353
That's still,

1276
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:41.290
it's actually if it goes from 1.8 till like uh,

1277
00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:46.500
if it goes from even something like 1.9 to 1.8 is like a pretty significant drop

1278
00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:52.330
us birth dip to 30 or low fertility rates sink further below replacement level.

1279
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.200
And so you think it's about the thought is that this is because of education and

1280
00:42:57.201 --> 00:43:00.740
this is because of people are waiting longer to have children and that this is a

1281
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:05.770
byproduct of industrialization and modern world and that the more educated and

1282
00:43:05.781 --> 00:43:06.830
affluent people get,

1283
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.730
the less likely they are to have children then it's not the same as far as what

1284
00:43:10.731 --> 00:43:15.320
everything I've read about it is that it's not a symptom of people doing poorly.

1285
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.090
It's a symptom of people doing well.

1286
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:18.720
You know there,

1287
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.800
there are definitely cases where Richard countries just have fewer kids and

1288
00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:27.110
that's cool because they concentrate on their careers right now the idea,

1289
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.051
but the,

1290
00:43:28.051 --> 00:43:29.420
the darker part of this Joe,

1291
00:43:29.421 --> 00:43:34.421
is that right now if you're a non college educated person in the United States,

1292
00:43:35.091 --> 00:43:38.720
the odds of you are ever getting married less than 50% now for the first time

1293
00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:39.620
ever.

1294
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.180
And then people are having fewer kids.

1295
00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.800
To play devil's advocate though,

1296
00:43:42.801 --> 00:43:43.160
the,

1297
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.890
the marriage thing might be people looking at it and go,

1298
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.311
God,

1299
00:43:46.311 --> 00:43:47.540
my parents got divorced,

1300
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:48.740
my brother got divorced,

1301
00:43:48.741 --> 00:43:49.820
everybody else got divorced.

1302
00:43:49.821 --> 00:43:51.050
What the fuck am I doing?

1303
00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.520
There are a lot of good reasons for it.

1304
00:43:52.521 --> 00:43:53.500
It's just,

1305
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.540
you know,

1306
00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:54.921
as a,

1307
00:43:54.921 --> 00:43:56.870
as a happily married man myself,

1308
00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:57.650
me as well,

1309
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:59.060
I always tell people don't do it.

1310
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.800
I tell people don't do it.

1311
00:44:00.801 --> 00:44:01.281
It's just,

1312
00:44:01.281 --> 00:44:02.114
it's too risky.

1313
00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:02.380
Yeah.

1314
00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:03.080
So,

1315
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.370
so you can look at,

1316
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:05.540
to me,

1317
00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:06.470
certainly to me,

1318
00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:10.340
me getting married and having kids like an act of like prosperity or optimism,

1319
00:44:10.341 --> 00:44:12.260
there are reasons why it's going down otherwise.

1320
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.720
But if you look at things like starting a new business,

1321
00:44:14.721 --> 00:44:16.520
I mean that being at multi decade lows,

1322
00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:18.080
it's like no positive spin on that,

1323
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.950
right?

1324
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:21.940
People moving between states is now what?

1325
00:44:21.941 --> 00:44:25.250
Multi decade lows people moving for a new job,

1326
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:29.570
multi decade lows like do you think this is the product of automation or it's a

1327
00:44:29.571 --> 00:44:31.950
product of a bunch of factors like

1328
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:37.290
<v 1>Internet but purchasing and marketing and think people buying most of their</v>

1329
00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:39.180
goods and clothes and stuff on.

1330
00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:40.470
It's a range of factors,

1331
00:44:40.471 --> 00:44:41.700
but one of the big problems,

1332
00:44:41.701 --> 00:44:42.511
and keep in mind,

1333
00:44:42.511 --> 00:44:47.511
I spent seven years helping entrepreneurs grow businesses in 18 cities around

1334
00:44:48.211 --> 00:44:48.721
the country.

1335
00:44:48.721 --> 00:44:51.540
Between 2011 2017 that was actually my job.

1336
00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:53.430
My job was to be the job creator guy.

1337
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:56.580
And so when you go out to these places,

1338
00:44:56.970 --> 00:45:01.970
you see that the dynamism is getting sucked up by certain markets to a level

1339
00:45:02.251 --> 00:45:05.040
that's unprecedented in our history like that,

1340
00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:10.041
that the disparities between Cleveland and San Francisco or Saint Louis and La

1341
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.911
are much,

1342
00:45:11.911 --> 00:45:15.990
much higher than they've been at any other historical period,

1343
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.360
both by the numbers end,

1344
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:20.070
like after you actually go to the places you're like,

1345
00:45:20.071 --> 00:45:20.341
wow,

1346
00:45:20.341 --> 00:45:23.850
like this is not a flourishing the way that you'd hoped.

1347
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.060
Do you feel like an economic Paul revere in a certain sense,

1348
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:29.040
like the robots are coming,

1349
00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:30.000
the robots are coming?

1350
00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:30.930
I do.

1351
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:31.440
Uh,

1352
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:31.981
it's weird,

1353
00:45:31.981 --> 00:45:32.600
man.

1354
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.450
The comparison I make is that if the United States economy is like an elephant,

1355
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:37.591
you know,

1356
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:39.270
the parable of like the people like,

1357
00:45:39.271 --> 00:45:39.421
you know,

1358
00:45:39.421 --> 00:45:41.190
blind people touching the elephant.

1359
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:42.030
Um,

1360
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.860
so I'm,

1361
00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:43.890
I'm an entrepreneur.

1362
00:45:43.891 --> 00:45:48.120
I sold a company to a public company that was a national education company is

1363
00:45:48.121 --> 00:45:48.954
based in New York.

1364
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:51.390
And what is the parable of blind people touching an elephant?

1365
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:51.650
Uh,

1366
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:52.710
so what happens is a,

1367
00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:52.991
they're,

1368
00:45:52.991 --> 00:45:55.620
they're like seven blind men and they get asked like,

1369
00:45:55.621 --> 00:45:56.370
what does the l,

1370
00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:57.480
what does an elephant look like?

1371
00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.450
And then one of them is touching the trunk and it's like an elephant looks like

1372
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:03.330
a snake and another one's touching his leg and it's like an elephant looks like

1373
00:46:03.331 --> 00:46:04.164
a tree trunk.

1374
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:04.950
Uh,

1375
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.950
so that's the way most people experience the economy is that they're like

1376
00:46:07.951 --> 00:46:09.600
touching a part of the economy and they're like,

1377
00:46:09.601 --> 00:46:11.430
this is what it looks like or feels like.

1378
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.780
So I've had this really strange set of experiences where I sold,

1379
00:46:15.781 --> 00:46:16.280
uh,

1380
00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.630
a national education company to a public company.

1381
00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:23.040
I lived by coastally between New York and San Francisco for the last five years.

1382
00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:25.800
I've operated in 18 cities around the country.

1383
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:26.461
I was,

1384
00:46:26.461 --> 00:46:26.790
uh,

1385
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:29.760
I was an appointee in the Obama administration in DC.

1386
00:46:29.761 --> 00:46:31.260
So I've actually seen the elephant,

1387
00:46:31.261 --> 00:46:32.094
if you know what I mean.

1388
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.220
Like I holo.

1389
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:33.661
Yeah.

1390
00:46:33.661 --> 00:46:34.051
Like I'm,

1391
00:46:34.051 --> 00:46:35.370
I'm like hanging out with,

1392
00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:36.151
uh,

1393
00:46:36.151 --> 00:46:38.760
the tech wizards and Silicon Valley and I'm like,

1394
00:46:38.761 --> 00:46:39.121
Hey,

1395
00:46:39.121 --> 00:46:39.320
you know,

1396
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.380
we can automate these jobs away.

1397
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:40.651
And they're like,

1398
00:46:40.651 --> 00:46:40.951
oh yeah,

1399
00:46:40.951 --> 00:46:41.241
we're going on.

1400
00:46:41.241 --> 00:46:42.074
I made the job.

1401
00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:43.600
Like it's,

1402
00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:44.300
you know,

1403
00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:44.750
so it's,

1404
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:46.440
it's not a mystery and they're not bad people.

1405
00:46:46.441 --> 00:46:46.801
It's like,

1406
00:46:46.801 --> 00:46:46.951
Hey,

1407
00:46:46.951 --> 00:46:48.200
it's my job to like make it.

1408
00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:53.160
And if you gave me a choice between making things work better and creating

1409
00:46:53.161 --> 00:46:55.050
abundant opportunities for the other people,

1410
00:46:55.051 --> 00:46:56.040
I would choose that.

1411
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:57.480
But I do not have that choice.

1412
00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:58.620
I have a job to do,

1413
00:46:58.650 --> 00:46:59.071
you know,

1414
00:46:59.071 --> 00:46:59.970
this is my job.

1415
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:01.770
And what I tell people is like,

1416
00:47:01.771 --> 00:47:05.070
whose responsibility then is it to go tell the people,

1417
00:47:05.071 --> 00:47:05.904
look,

1418
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:06.810
it's technology.

1419
00:47:06.811 --> 00:47:10.530
It's transformed the economy in fundamental ways and we need to make it so that

1420
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.820
everyone benefits.

1421
00:47:11.821 --> 00:47:15.020
And it's not just that this like hyper concentrated set of winners and then this

1422
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:16.950
like huge army of,

1423
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:20.250
of relative losers and it's the government's job.

1424
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.400
But at this point we've given up on our government as anything.

1425
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.440
Like it can't really do anything.

1426
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:26.970
And so now it's no one's job.

1427
00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:28.980
And so somehow Joe,

1428
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.040
it has become my

1429
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.230
<v 2>job and it blows my mind too sometimes.</v>

1430
00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:33.423
Now

1431
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:39.220
coming from a place of being a serial entrepreneur to this presidential

1432
00:47:39.221 --> 00:47:43.630
candidate has kind of warning people about the upcoming technological apocalypse

1433
00:47:43.631 --> 00:47:44.464
as it were.

1434
00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:45.220
Um,

1435
00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:48.730
how did you make that transition and what w what was your motivation to get

1436
00:47:48.731 --> 00:47:49.391
involved in this?

1437
00:47:49.391 --> 00:47:51.910
To the point we are actually running for president on this platform.

1438
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:52.601
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1439
00:47:52.601 --> 00:47:53.680
So uh,

1440
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:59.050
so sell solid company in 2009 and that was the financial crisis.

1441
00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:03.490
Like Wall Street had crashed the economy and I had personally taught these kids

1442
00:48:03.491 --> 00:48:05.790
who'd worked at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and,

1443
00:48:05.791 --> 00:48:06.521
and Mckinsey.

1444
00:48:06.521 --> 00:48:06.971
And I was like,

1445
00:48:06.971 --> 00:48:07.151
man,

1446
00:48:07.151 --> 00:48:10.090
we need smart kids to do something other than just head to Wall Street and

1447
00:48:10.091 --> 00:48:12.850
Silicon Valley and we need to have them go to Detroit,

1448
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:14.140
St Louis,

1449
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.741
Baltimore,

1450
00:48:14.741 --> 00:48:15.071
New Orleans,

1451
00:48:15.071 --> 00:48:15.904
start businesses.

1452
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.350
So I quit my job,

1453
00:48:17.351 --> 00:48:21.370
I donated a low six figures to start this new organization.

1454
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:24.940
And then we trained hundreds of entrepreneurs and helped create several thousand

1455
00:48:24.941 --> 00:48:25.774
jobs.

1456
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.460
So that was like my wholesome give back.

1457
00:48:27.461 --> 00:48:27.911
I was like,

1458
00:48:27.911 --> 00:48:28.151
Hey,

1459
00:48:28.151 --> 00:48:28.984
I'm like the,

1460
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.650
you know the guy who just believes in entrepreneurship because just like you,

1461
00:48:32.651 --> 00:48:34.150
I freaking love entrepreneurs.

1462
00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.260
And I was like,

1463
00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:35.861
so here's the joke.

1464
00:48:35.861 --> 00:48:36.251
I used to tell,

1465
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:36.941
I went to law school,

1466
00:48:36.941 --> 00:48:38.530
I was an unhappy lawyer for five months.

1467
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:39.703
Uh,

1468
00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:43.240
and so what I tell people is like if you're a clueless,

1469
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:48.160
ambitious 22 year old who came out of college and you say to your parents,

1470
00:48:48.161 --> 00:48:48.281
Hey,

1471
00:48:48.281 --> 00:48:49.210
I'm going to go to law school,

1472
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.520
they're going to say that's great.

1473
00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:55.040
It's really easy to find the law school cause they're just there.

1474
00:48:55.041 --> 00:48:58.600
You just apply to it and the government will give you $100,000 loan,

1475
00:48:58.601 --> 00:48:59.500
no questions asked.

1476
00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:01.480
And then if you say to your parents,

1477
00:49:01.481 --> 00:49:01.601
Hey,

1478
00:49:01.601 --> 00:49:02.740
I want to be an entrepreneur,

1479
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:04.540
your parents will think that's stupid.

1480
00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.690
It's hard to find and no one's going to give you $100,000 loan.

1481
00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:12.550
So we have this huge oversupply of indebted a law school graduates.

1482
00:49:12.551 --> 00:49:15.850
And the huge under supply of entrepreneurs was my thinking.

1483
00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:16.481
And so I was like,

1484
00:49:16.481 --> 00:49:16.781
okay,

1485
00:49:16.781 --> 00:49:17.680
how do we fix that?

1486
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.890
So I started this organization venture for America to try and fix that.

1487
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.660
And so imagine being this guy,

1488
00:49:22.661 --> 00:49:26.080
getting medals and awards for helping create jobs around the country and then

1489
00:49:26.081 --> 00:49:30.490
realizing that automation is coming like a tidal wave and that your efforts that

1490
00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:34.060
you're getting applauded for are really not going to do the trick.

1491
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:38.740
And then Donald Trump wins the election in 2016 and for whatever reason,

1492
00:49:38.741 --> 00:49:39.521
in my opinion,

1493
00:49:39.521 --> 00:49:42.190
the media is just not being honest about all the economic drivers.

1494
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.470
They're blaming racism,

1495
00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:45.460
Russia,

1496
00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:46.720
Facebook,

1497
00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:47.830
the FBI.

1498
00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:51.580
And if you look at the voter district data on a district by district basis,

1499
00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:56.080
there's a straight line up between the adoption of industrial robots in that

1500
00:49:56.081 --> 00:49:58.600
voting district and the movement towards Trump.

1501
00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:03.970
Like it's a straight economic story where we blasted away for a million

1502
00:50:03.971 --> 00:50:08.530
manufacturing jobs in the swing states and Donald Trump is our president.

1503
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:12.190
So imagine being me and in seeing that and being like,

1504
00:50:12.191 --> 00:50:13.024
okay,

1505
00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.140
I get it.

1506
00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:15.190
This is an economic,

1507
00:50:15.191 --> 00:50:16.390
technological story.

1508
00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:19.030
And then I went to people in Washington DC.

1509
00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:19.601
I was like,

1510
00:50:19.601 --> 00:50:19.991
hey guys,

1511
00:50:19.991 --> 00:50:20.680
what are we going to do?

1512
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:24.250
We're in the third inning of the greatest economic and technological

1513
00:50:24.251 --> 00:50:26.170
transformation in the history of our country.

1514
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.520
And the inning has brought us Donald Trump,

1515
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:29.631
the fourth,

1516
00:50:29.631 --> 00:50:29.931
fifth,

1517
00:50:29.931 --> 00:50:31.880
sixth endings are going to be horrific.

1518
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:33.650
What are we going to do?

1519
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:38.180
And then the answers I got were somewhere between disappointing and horrifying,

1520
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.820
where if you go to mainstream politicians and you're like,

1521
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:41.654
what are we going to do?

1522
00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:44.390
The answers I got were literally number one.

1523
00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:45.620
We cannot talk about that.

1524
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:47.481
Number two,

1525
00:50:47.481 --> 00:50:48.470
we should study that.

1526
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:50.020
We cannot talk about that.

1527
00:50:50.021 --> 00:50:50.270
That was,

1528
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:51.620
that's verbatim really.

1529
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:52.460
Yeah.

1530
00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:53.570
And why were they saying that?

1531
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.220
Because it seems alarmists like anti progress or like,

1532
00:50:58.221 --> 00:50:59.010
you know,

1533
00:50:59.010 --> 00:50:59.571
you're like,

1534
00:50:59.571 --> 00:51:00.380
uh,

1535
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:00.770
you know,

1536
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:02.570
throwing stones at it like,

1537
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:04.910
like big tech companies and it's like,

1538
00:51:04.911 --> 00:51:05.750
I'm not throwing stones at anyone.

1539
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:06.770
I'm just pointing out the fact.

1540
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.390
So number one is,

1541
00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.140
uh,

1542
00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:09.801
so number one was,

1543
00:51:09.801 --> 00:51:10.634
can't talk about it.

1544
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:11.930
Number two was need to study it.

1545
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:14.810
And the number three was the point you made a originally,

1546
00:51:14.811 --> 00:51:17.810
which was we must educate and retrain Americans for the jobs of the future.

1547
00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.220
And then when I was like,

1548
00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:19.461
Hey,

1549
00:51:19.461 --> 00:51:21.950
we're terrible at that by the numbers,

1550
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.420
then they'd literally be like,

1551
00:51:23.421 --> 00:51:23.601
well,

1552
00:51:23.601 --> 00:51:25.280
I guess we'll learn to get better at it then.

1553
00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:25.940
And then I,

1554
00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.910
so I came back to my home in New York City and I was like,

1555
00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:29.773
oh my gosh,

1556
00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.620
we are so backward and far gone as a,

1557
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.030
as it certainly as a government.

1558
00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:35.840
Um,

1559
00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:38.810
and so then I was grappling with it and I'm a parent like you are.

1560
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:40.550
And I looked at my kids and I was like,

1561
00:51:40.551 --> 00:51:42.740
am I really gonna bring them up in this shit show?

1562
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.050
Like is this really that?

1563
00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:45.080
Is this really the plan?

1564
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:46.610
And so then I was like,

1565
00:51:46.611 --> 00:51:47.360
okay,

1566
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.360
how would you actually solve this problem if you,

1567
00:51:50.361 --> 00:51:51.380
if you had to do so?

1568
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.550
And so then I said,

1569
00:51:52.551 --> 00:51:53.384
okay,

1570
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:54.620
universal basic income,

1571
00:51:54.621 --> 00:51:57.560
rebranded the freedom dividend after we did a bunch of tests because it tests

1572
00:51:57.561 --> 00:52:00.860
much better as the freedom dividend than universal basic income.

1573
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:02.263
And,

1574
00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.310
and then try and make the,

1575
00:52:04.311 --> 00:52:08.270
the rules of the economy work better for more people as fast as we can before

1576
00:52:08.271 --> 00:52:10.850
this automation wave really crescendos.

1577
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.713
What do you mean by that?

1578
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:12.741
Well,

1579
00:52:12.741 --> 00:52:13.431
to me like,

1580
00:52:13.431 --> 00:52:17.630
you know what I'm saying is like retail and truck driving are the two major,

1581
00:52:17.631 --> 00:52:18.230
major,

1582
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:20.930
obvious sectors that are going to get displaced.

1583
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:24.950
Being a retail worker is the most common job in the United States right now.

1584
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:26.600
The average retail workers,

1585
00:52:26.601 --> 00:52:30.740
a 39 year old woman with a high school education making between 11 and $12 an

1586
00:52:30.741 --> 00:52:31.400
hour.

1587
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.240
So what do those workers do when 30% of the malls and stores close in the next

1588
00:52:35.241 --> 00:52:36.074
five years?

1589
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:36.621
You know,

1590
00:52:36.621 --> 00:52:38.240
and then truckers are next in line,

1591
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.960
you know,

1592
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.340
by the five to 10 year mark.

1593
00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:45.520
So it was like we have to get our acts together before these populations end up

1594
00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:46.730
getting displaced.

1595
00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.300
And we know Americans don't have a ton of savings to fall back on.

1596
00:52:50.301 --> 00:52:51.134
It's not like they'll be like,

1597
00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:51.471
oh,

1598
00:52:51.471 --> 00:52:51.711
like,

1599
00:52:51.711 --> 00:52:51.951
you know,

1600
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:54.880
let me take a month off to like think about that.

1601
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.780
That's not the real life situation.

1602
00:52:56.781 --> 00:53:00.560
Most Americans live and experience.

1603
00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:01.520
So,

1604
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.450
so this is all 2017 where I'm like doing the data research and saying like,

1605
00:53:05.451 --> 00:53:06.284
okay,

1606
00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.760
like what's the plan?

1607
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:10.550
And then when I went to various politicians,

1608
00:53:10.551 --> 00:53:10.911
I was like,

1609
00:53:10.911 --> 00:53:12.920
there is no appetite for making this case.

1610
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:15.650
There's no appetite for anyone even talking about this.

1611
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:20.950
So the only thing I can see that would have a realistic chance of accelerating

1612
00:53:20.961 --> 00:53:25.830
meaningful solutions to this automation wave in a five to 10 year timeframe is

1613
00:53:25.831 --> 00:53:28.650
if I run for president and I either win,

1614
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:30.060
which is very doable,

1615
00:53:30.061 --> 00:53:30.894
I can win,

1616
00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:31.530
um,

1617
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:36.390
or I mainstream this set of considerations to a point where other politicians

1618
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:40.080
are willing to tackle something like universal basic income and make it a

1619
00:53:40.081 --> 00:53:41.780
reality in that timeframe.

1620
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.493
Um,

1621
00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:44.730
anyone can win,

1622
00:53:44.731 --> 00:53:45.180
right?

1623
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.620
I mean it is possible.

1624
00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.750
I mean there are voters,

1625
00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:49.710
people are voting,

1626
00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:52.440
but do you really believe that you can win?

1627
00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:52.981
Well,

1628
00:53:52.981 --> 00:53:53.610
Joe,

1629
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:55.140
I'm going to be running if you wouldn't,

1630
00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:55.471
right.

1631
00:53:55.471 --> 00:53:56.191
I believe that,

1632
00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:56.700
but,

1633
00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:57.930
but if you were not,

1634
00:53:57.931 --> 00:53:58.764
you

1635
00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:01.200
know,

1636
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:01.361
I,

1637
00:54:01.361 --> 00:54:06.361
I appreciate the question and I've been very up front the whole time is that if

1638
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:11.520
my ideas and policies become front and center and we get this done,

1639
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.220
then if I'm not pressing the United States,

1640
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:16.200
like I'm perfectly happy with that.

1641
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:17.490
Like I'm on the record just being like,

1642
00:54:17.491 --> 00:54:18.630
I'm just trying to solve problems.

1643
00:54:18.631 --> 00:54:21.870
I'm an entrepreneur trying to solve a problem that said,

1644
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:22.620
uh,

1645
00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:24.570
I'm already pulling at 1% nationally.

1646
00:54:24.571 --> 00:54:27.780
I'm tied with Kirsten Gillibrand and other national politicians right now as

1647
00:54:27.781 --> 00:54:28.380
we're sitting here.

1648
00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.213
I have no idea.

1649
00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.290
Do you Kirsten Gillibrand,

1650
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.550
she's a senator from New York,

1651
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.920
so that was nice to be like an a national politician.

1652
00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:37.800
Normal morons like myself are not aware of that.

1653
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.380
Like I wouldn't have known that you were running if it wasn't for Sam.

1654
00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:41.640
I appreciate that man.

1655
00:54:41.641 --> 00:54:42.151
But now,

1656
00:54:42.151 --> 00:54:44.370
happily everyone who's a fan of yours,

1657
00:54:44.371 --> 00:54:47.900
which is apparently everybody now knows I'm reading.

1658
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.900
Um,

1659
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.190
but so you're,

1660
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.980
you're right that most people have never heard of Andrew Yang and I'm already

1661
00:54:52.981 --> 00:54:55.950
pulling at 1% enough for me to make the debates.

1662
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:57.240
Are you running as an independent?

1663
00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:01.320
I'm running as a Democrat because the mechanics make it such that that is

1664
00:55:01.321 --> 00:55:04.200
necessary for you to be able to actually succeed and win.

1665
00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:08.160
But I can go through with you the mechanics and you might enjoy this because I

1666
00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:08.850
know you,

1667
00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:12.690
you and Sam another sometimes talk politics in presidential politics.

1668
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:14.063
So,

1669
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:14.880
uh,

1670
00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:15.750
I'm an operator,

1671
00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:16.643
I'm an entrepreneur.

1672
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:17.910
And so you get to and be like,

1673
00:55:17.911 --> 00:55:18.181
okay,

1674
00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:19.170
what does it take to be president?

1675
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.450
So there are two rules to run for president.

1676
00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:24.000
One is you have to be 35 years or older check.

1677
00:55:24.001 --> 00:55:27.180
And then the second is natural born citizen check only rules.

1678
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.193
That's it.

1679
00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:30.480
So then you get into the process and you say,

1680
00:55:30.481 --> 00:55:31.314
okay,

1681
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.570
the first two states to vote Iowa and New Hampshire,

1682
00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:37.320
now they're going to be about 20 people running for president as a democrat.

1683
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:38.393
This cycle,

1684
00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:39.151
you probably knew that,

1685
00:55:39.151 --> 00:55:39.984
right?

1686
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.393
So,

1687
00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:41.870
uh,

1688
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:44.280
you look at the Iowa Caucus.

1689
00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:46.920
Iowa has a population of 3.1 million,

1690
00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:52.520
but only 171,000 Iowans participated in the caucus in 2016 because it's on a

1691
00:55:53.591 --> 00:55:54.660
very high investment.

1692
00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.210
Now they changed the rules.

1693
00:55:56.211 --> 00:55:57.570
So this year it's going to be closer to like,

1694
00:55:57.571 --> 00:55:59.160
let's call it 250,000.

1695
00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:05.210
But if you have 20 candidates to finish top three in a field at 20 you probably

1696
00:56:05.551 --> 00:56:09.570
need about 40 to 50,000 Iowans to get onboard.

1697
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:11.011
So you say,

1698
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:11.281
Hey,

1699
00:56:11.281 --> 00:56:12.640
do do I think I can be present?

1700
00:56:12.641 --> 00:56:13.474
The United States,

1701
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.090
the threshold question is this,

1702
00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:19.230
can I get 40 to 50,000 Iowans on board with the idea that them and their family

1703
00:56:19.231 --> 00:56:23.010
members getting $1,000 a month is a good idea that that would actually help

1704
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:23.853
improve their lives?

1705
00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:24.011
<v 2>Well,</v>

1706
00:56:24.011 --> 00:56:26.680
I'm sure it would help improve their lives and I'm sure they would agree with

1707
00:56:26.681 --> 00:56:26.980
you.

1708
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:27.880
The question is,

1709
00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:29.260
what are the other thing?

1710
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:30.170
See,

1711
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:33.940
I don't think most people are aware that this is coming.

1712
00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:38.530
And I think you educating people and explaining all these statistics and seeing

1713
00:56:38.531 --> 00:56:39.241
the forecast,

1714
00:56:39.241 --> 00:56:42.520
particularly from your position as a serial entrepreneur who has a deep

1715
00:56:42.521 --> 00:56:45.130
background in business and you have a deep understanding of this,

1716
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.911
you're,

1717
00:56:45.911 --> 00:56:48.910
you're helping in a tremendous way by educating people.

1718
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.920
But I think most people have,

1719
00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:53.620
it may be a logically,

1720
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:55.450
but they have different concerns.

1721
00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.050
So how do you address these other concerns?

1722
00:56:59.051 --> 00:56:59.410
Like,

1723
00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:00.850
I bet if you polled people,

1724
00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:02.050
what are the issues?

1725
00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:07.000
What are the issues in this upcoming 2020 presidential race that you know who's

1726
00:57:07.001 --> 00:57:08.050
going to beat Donald Trump?

1727
00:57:08.051 --> 00:57:08.980
How do you do it?

1728
00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:11.050
And this is like on the democratic side,

1729
00:57:11.051 --> 00:57:12.640
the idea is like anyone but Trump,

1730
00:57:12.641 --> 00:57:12.990
right?

1731
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:13.360
Yeah.

1732
00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:13.870
This is,

1733
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:18.370
I mean there would be so happy if fill in the blank Tulsi Gabard you,

1734
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.740
whoever on the Republican side,

1735
00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:23.890
obviously it's Trump unless someone comes along or he goes to jail,

1736
00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:24.220
right?

1737
00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:25.480
Those are the two possibilities.

1738
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:31.390
What of the other issues and that you feel that people are really concerned

1739
00:57:32.951 --> 00:57:37.480
about that you can perhaps shed some unique light on?

1740
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.881
<v 1>So the,</v>

1741
00:57:38.881 --> 00:57:42.810
the three big policy is I'm running on our one the freedom dividend cause a lot

1742
00:57:42.811 --> 00:57:45.960
of Americans are seeing their paychecks not keep up with their expenses.

1743
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:51.470
Number two is we need to get healthcare off the backs of businesses and families

1744
00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:53.400
and move towards a single payer system.

1745
00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:54.750
Medicare for all.

1746
00:57:54.751 --> 00:57:58.710
Because as an entrepreneur it makes it harder to hire people.

1747
00:57:58.711 --> 00:57:59.730
When you do hire people,

1748
00:57:59.731 --> 00:58:02.550
you want to make them contractors and not fulltime employees.

1749
00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:05.580
It makes it harder for people to start businesses because they're concerned

1750
00:58:05.581 --> 00:58:07.410
about keeping their health care for their families.

1751
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:11.550
So we've got to get health care off the backs of businesses and families and try

1752
00:58:11.551 --> 00:58:13.110
and make the economy more dynamic.

1753
00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:16.950
And we spent twice as much on healthcare as other countries do to worst results.

1754
00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.290
Like it's right now we're in like the worst of all worlds.

1755
00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:22.050
And the third thing is,

1756
00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:24.780
and I referenced my wife when I talk about this,

1757
00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:26.490
but my wife was at home with our two boys,

1758
00:58:26.491 --> 00:58:27.091
six and three,

1759
00:58:27.091 --> 00:58:28.290
one of whom is autistic.

1760
00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:29.850
And when I say is like,

1761
00:58:29.851 --> 00:58:32.490
what is her work valued at in GDP?

1762
00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:34.590
And then people think about it and they're like,

1763
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:35.131
I don't know.

1764
00:58:35.131 --> 00:58:36.660
And then like zero as GDP,

1765
00:58:36.661 --> 00:58:40.530
like doesn't consider that actual economic contribution.

1766
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:41.461
Uh,

1767
00:58:41.461 --> 00:58:42.131
and then I say we,

1768
00:58:42.131 --> 00:58:46.110
we have to do is we have to actually evolve from GDP as a measuring stick

1769
00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.660
because it actually doesn't work for us.

1770
00:58:48.661 --> 00:58:50.370
It's almost a hundred years old.

1771
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.170
We made it up during the Great Depression.

1772
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:55.140
Self driving trucks are going to drive GDP way up,

1773
00:58:55.141 --> 00:58:55.980
but it's going to be very,

1774
00:58:55.981 --> 00:58:58.050
very bad for many people and communities.

1775
00:58:58.350 --> 00:59:00.870
So we have to actually change the measuring sticks to something that would

1776
00:59:00.871 --> 00:59:03.450
actually make our economy work for us,

1777
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:03.761
make,

1778
00:59:03.761 --> 00:59:07.470
make it so that the market serves us instead of all us being inputs to the

1779
00:59:07.471 --> 00:59:08.250
market.

1780
00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:09.960
Because if we're all inputs in the market,

1781
00:59:09.961 --> 00:59:14.280
we lose to robots and AI [inaudible] hands down and it's not like it doesn't

1782
00:59:14.281 --> 00:59:16.740
matter if you were like a really conscientious,

1783
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:19.410
hardworking truck driver or like a really lazy,

1784
00:59:19.411 --> 00:59:19.831
sloppy one.

1785
00:59:19.831 --> 00:59:20.520
It doesn't matter.

1786
00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:20.941
Like you know,

1787
00:59:20.941 --> 00:59:22.010
it matter if you were like a really

1788
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.690
<v 0>diligent radiologist or like,</v>

1789
00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:24.110
uh,

1790
00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:24.943
it doesn't matter.

1791
00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:30.100
So we have to shift the market's emphasis to actually fuel our wellbeing and

1792
00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:32.090
change from GDP,

1793
00:59:32.091 --> 00:59:32.601
which is again,

1794
00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:35.040
this archaic measurement we made up to,

1795
00:59:35.110 --> 00:59:38.720
to things that would actually correspond to how we're doing things like health,

1796
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:40.490
how childhood success rates,

1797
00:59:40.491 --> 00:59:41.720
environmental quantify,

1798
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:42.551
<v 2>how do you,</v>

1799
00:59:42.551 --> 00:59:47.140
how would you quantify that in a way that would be translatable to the average

1800
00:59:47.141 --> 00:59:47.960
voter?

1801
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:48.171
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1802
00:59:48.171 --> 00:59:49.910
so we have measurements for most of these things.

1803
00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:50.811
And again,

1804
00:59:50.811 --> 00:59:52.670
if you look at our numbers right now,

1805
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.481
you'd see,

1806
00:59:53.481 --> 00:59:53.751
it's like,

1807
00:59:53.751 --> 00:59:54.080
what?

1808
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:57.140
Like how many people listening to this know that America is life expectancy is

1809
00:59:57.141 --> 00:59:58.370
declined for the last three years.

1810
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:59.060
You know,

1811
00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.190
that to me would be like a pretty important measurement.

1812
01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:05.010
<v 2>Is it cause as suicide?</v>

1813
01:00:05.011 --> 01:00:10.011
Is it because of drug overdose it because of obesity diet?

1814
01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:10.580
What is it?

1815
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:10.830
<v 0>The,</v>

1816
01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:14.960
the two causes that people point to the most are that drug overdoses and

1817
01:00:14.961 --> 01:00:18.290
suicides have overtaken be [inaudible] deaths as,

1818
01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.920
as the most frequent deaths in the United States.

1819
01:00:21.921 --> 01:00:23.440
I didn't know that suicide was on that list.

1820
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:24.720
I knew that drug overdose said,

1821
01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:28.280
taken obesity with suicides of o overtaken obesity as well.

1822
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:29.860
Suicides of overtaken,

1823
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.230
uh,

1824
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:31.063
car accidents.

1825
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:32.023
I'm not sure about it.

1826
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.571
I'm sorry.

1827
01:00:32.571 --> 01:00:32.990
I meant

1828
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.801
<v 2>I'm at car accidents.</v>

1829
01:00:33.801 --> 01:00:34.370
I misspoke.

1830
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:37.640
So car accidents used to be number one.

1831
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:38.150
Yeah.

1832
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:41.330
Suicides are higher than car accidents now.

1833
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:42.223
Yeah.

1834
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:44.270
So suicides,

1835
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:46.340
drug overdoses,

1836
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:50.540
and then car accidents or suicides and drug overdoses.

1837
01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:52.250
<v 0>I think drug overdose and number one,</v>

1838
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:52.760
number one,

1839
01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.660
and then suicides,

1840
01:00:53.661 --> 01:00:54.410
number two.

1841
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:55.100
Wow.

1842
01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:55.430
Uh,

1843
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:58.070
and so that's why life expectancy has declined for the last,

1844
01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:00.770
you think that the suit and very much likely,

1845
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:05.330
there's at least some of the number of the suicides are related to economic

1846
01:01:05.331 --> 01:01:06.164
disparity.

1847
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:06.651
Oh,

1848
01:01:06.651 --> 01:01:07.130
yeah.

1849
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:07.371
I mean,

1850
01:01:07.371 --> 01:01:12.371
if you look at the suicide rate in it's particularly pronounced in 50 to 50 year

1851
01:01:12.651 --> 01:01:13.220
old,

1852
01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:15.290
50 to 54 year old white Americans,

1853
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:17.060
which are the population that,

1854
01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:17.211
I mean,

1855
01:01:17.211 --> 01:01:18.044
you resemble that.

1856
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:18.590
That's me.

1857
01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:18.801
Yeah.

1858
01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:19.310
That's you,

1859
01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:22.490
which resembles the population that right now is as reaching a point where

1860
01:01:22.491 --> 01:01:22.851
they're like,

1861
01:01:22.851 --> 01:01:23.061
hey,

1862
01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:24.650
my job skills don't have any,

1863
01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:25.970
uh,

1864
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:26.540
you know,

1865
01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.010
like utility,

1866
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:28.380
uh,

1867
01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.213
in the marketplace.

1868
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:30.650
And then they go home and they just like,

1869
01:01:30.651 --> 01:01:30.921
you know,

1870
01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:32.180
start looking around and being like,

1871
01:01:32.181 --> 01:01:33.014
what am I doing?

1872
01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:33.351
I mean,

1873
01:01:33.351 --> 01:01:33.551
it's,

1874
01:01:33.551 --> 01:01:34.790
it's really dark.

1875
01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.541
It's punitive,

1876
01:01:35.541 --> 01:01:36.374
it's punishing.

1877
01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:41.450
And we've put our citizens in this situation where we all see ourselves as

1878
01:01:41.451 --> 01:01:42.590
economic inputs,

1879
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.170
what the market says we're worth is what we're worth.

1880
01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.410
And if we're worth less than it's our fault.

1881
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:50.120
And so the next move is to say,

1882
01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:50.391
okay,

1883
01:01:50.391 --> 01:01:51.740
I guess you know this place.

1884
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:51.951
Uh,

1885
01:01:51.951 --> 01:01:52.970
there's no place for me here.

1886
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.770
I don't mean to sound skeptical,

1887
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:59.920
but I just don't believe that $1,000 in a month is going to fix that.

1888
01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:04.400
It seems like that would be a good thing.

1889
01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:07.220
Certainly not moving in the wrong direction,

1890
01:02:07.221 --> 01:02:08.750
certainly moving in the right direction,

1891
01:02:08.751 --> 01:02:13.280
but it seems that there needs to be some sort of a massive rethinking of

1892
01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.990
civilization itself.

1893
01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.100
If you're going to have that many things that are going to be automated and that

1894
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:19.651
people,

1895
01:02:19.651 --> 01:02:24.540
they're going to be out of jobs and feeling that the world that they prepared

1896
01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:26.040
for no longer exists.

1897
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:26.903
Yes.

1898
01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.090
It seems like we need a step further,

1899
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:32.640
another move a hundred percent brother.

1900
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.160
And that's one reason why the freedom dividends not like,

1901
01:02:35.161 --> 01:02:35.520
uh,

1902
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:35.731
like,

1903
01:02:35.731 --> 01:02:36.050
uh,

1904
01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:36.990
it doesn't solve the problem.

1905
01:02:36.991 --> 01:02:37.680
Right?

1906
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.680
The problem is fundamentally one of reconstituting means of structure,

1907
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:45.600
purpose and fulfillment in people's lives,

1908
01:02:45.601 --> 01:02:47.370
particularly in men's lives.

1909
01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:48.510
How do we do that?

1910
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:49.343
Right?

1911
01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.440
So one important aspect of that is to actually start measuring how we are doing

1912
01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:57.180
as a society.

1913
01:02:57.181 --> 01:02:59.160
And saying that's actually where we're trying to go.

1914
01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:01.080
So instead of using GDP,

1915
01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:06.100
using some sort of other quantifiable method of measuring health and happiness

1916
01:03:07.201 --> 01:03:08.100
and fulfillment,

1917
01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:08.880
yes,

1918
01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.500
levels of engagement with work,

1919
01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:12.183
uh,

1920
01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:13.440
in mental health,

1921
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:14.131
I mean you can,

1922
01:03:14.131 --> 01:03:15.630
we have measurements for that.

1923
01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.280
We are sophisticated enough to do that.

1924
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:18.720
And then if we say,

1925
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:19.681
then as president,

1926
01:03:19.681 --> 01:03:21.630
I'm going to be up there in 2021 being like,

1927
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:21.721
Oh,

1928
01:03:21.721 --> 01:03:24.450
here's the state of the Union and here's like the data and then we're going to

1929
01:03:24.451 --> 01:03:24.541
say,

1930
01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:25.291
you don't want to try and do,

1931
01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:28.530
we're actually going to try and move those measurements in the right direction.

1932
01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:33.300
So let's try and get drug overdoses down by 50% in two years.

1933
01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:36.350
Let's try and get our mental health up a little bit like in,

1934
01:03:36.351 --> 01:03:40.860
in these ways and then make it so that that person who was at home being like,

1935
01:03:40.861 --> 01:03:41.251
okay,

1936
01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:41.730
like,

1937
01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:42.480
you know,

1938
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.010
like there's not a job for me.

1939
01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:45.900
I'm getting 1000 bucks a month.

1940
01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.850
That does not solve all my problems.

1941
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:49.170
It takes the edge off,

1942
01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:53.490
but then we can hopefully start re constituting what that person's,

1943
01:03:54.210 --> 01:03:54.880
uh,

1944
01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.060
purpose is in their community,

1945
01:03:57.061 --> 01:03:58.080
in their neighborhood.

1946
01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:03.300
And so one of the things that I'm going to point out is that if you pump 1000

1947
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.010
bucks a month into that neighborhood,

1948
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.470
it ends up creating a whole new rung of opportunities for the people in that

1949
01:04:10.471 --> 01:04:11.304
community.

1950
01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:13.350
Like some of that money goes to,

1951
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:14.430
you know,

1952
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:18.780
like youth leagues and churches and nonprofits,

1953
01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:19.370
uh,

1954
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:21.960
and creates jobs right there in that community.

1955
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.990
One of the examples I use is like if you're in a town in Missouri with 50,000

1956
01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:25.824
people,

1957
01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:27.360
and let's say you really like to bake,

1958
01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:31.590
but starting a bakery is a dumb idea because people just do not have money in

1959
01:04:31.591 --> 01:04:32.880
that town to buy your baked goods.

1960
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:38.450
But then I pumped $60 million a year into that economy and a lot of that just

1961
01:04:38.881 --> 01:04:40.770
circulates right there in that town.

1962
01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.660
Then if I start a bakery,

1963
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:44.100
it's a good idea.

1964
01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:45.840
And I know if my bakery fails,

1965
01:04:45.841 --> 01:04:46.710
I'm not going to die.

1966
01:04:46.711 --> 01:04:49.260
I can at least go home and get my dividend.

1967
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:50.880
And then if I go to other people and say,

1968
01:04:50.881 --> 01:04:51.061
hey,

1969
01:04:51.061 --> 01:04:52.480
you want to like help me out with this?

1970
01:04:52.481 --> 01:04:54.480
And then they also think it's a better idea than they would have.

1971
01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:57.030
So the money is not the solution.

1972
01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.840
The money helps set the stage for the solutions.

1973
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:02.280
So does the measurements.

1974
01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.120
So it is if you,

1975
01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:06.480
cause right now if like you don't even know that your life expectancy is

1976
01:05:06.481 --> 01:05:08.400
declining and it's kind of hard to solve that problem.

1977
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.361
So if you say,

1978
01:05:09.361 --> 01:05:09.661
look,

1979
01:05:09.661 --> 01:05:11.850
this is actually how we measure how we're doing.

1980
01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:15.240
And then you go in and say okay like local government,

1981
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.440
Ngo,

1982
01:05:16.441 --> 01:05:19.600
entrepreneur cause right now like our entrepreneurs don't,

1983
01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.810
none of our entrepreneurs are working on trying to make that dude's life better

1984
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:23.920
right now.

1985
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.161
You know,

1986
01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:26.080
it's like that that's not only do so much.

1987
01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:27.970
Most entrepreneurs are just trying to succeed.

1988
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.920
I mean it's very difficult to start a business,

1989
01:05:29.921 --> 01:05:30.161
right?

1990
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:32.080
And then they actually have it work out.

1991
01:05:32.081 --> 01:05:32.914
Well,

1992
01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:35.500
the idea that they're going to look out for truck drivers,

1993
01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:37.570
it's not realistic,

1994
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:42.190
but it at least we can start moving ourselves in that general direction if we

1995
01:05:42.191 --> 01:05:42.760
start.

1996
01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.080
Because as a CEO,

1997
01:05:44.081 --> 01:05:44.591
you know this,

1998
01:05:44.591 --> 01:05:45.550
you make what you measure,

1999
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:46.691
you're not measuring it,

2000
01:05:46.691 --> 01:05:47.800
you have no chance.

2001
01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:48.190
Right?

2002
01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:49.270
If you start measuring it,

2003
01:05:49.271 --> 01:05:51.910
you at least start to open up the chance.

2004
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.010
But what you're saying is the most profound,

2005
01:05:54.011 --> 01:05:57.490
which is like we need to reconstitute and meaning for many,

2006
01:05:57.491 --> 01:05:58.600
many Americans.

2007
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:59.770
And that's what,

2008
01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:00.604
to me,

2009
01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.280
the most destructive aspect of that.

2010
01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:03.521
You know,

2011
01:06:03.521 --> 01:06:03.851
again,

2012
01:06:03.851 --> 01:06:04.580
like the,

2013
01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:08.140
the mental health indicators and like the suicides and the rest of it is like

2014
01:06:08.141 --> 01:06:09.610
there's a real loss of meaning.

2015
01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:10.390
Uh,

2016
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.901
for many,

2017
01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:12.340
many people here in this country,

2018
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:15.340
well obviously we're talking about a large scale,

2019
01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:19.990
but if you go back to the time before trucks and truck drivers,

2020
01:06:19.991 --> 01:06:22.510
that was not a viable occupation.

2021
01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:24.070
It wasn't something people did,

2022
01:06:24.071 --> 01:06:26.140
but yet they still found a way to occupy their time.

2023
01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:31.140
Do you think that there needs to be some sort of an education and some,

2024
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:32.131
some sort of a,

2025
01:06:32.131 --> 01:06:37.131
a method of explaining to young people in particular that you have to think of

2026
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:42.490
something to do because most of the things that you think you can do won't

2027
01:06:42.491 --> 01:06:43.324
exist.

2028
01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.460
So we have to think of what are the other possibilities and be creative and do

2029
01:06:48.461 --> 01:06:52.330
something with your life that only a human being can do.

2030
01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:56.770
Which is a really weird way to think about it because most of the things you

2031
01:06:56.830 --> 01:07:00.520
used to be able to thank that a human being could do for a living are now going

2032
01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:01.720
to be done by robots.

2033
01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.490
But I don't think,

2034
01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:07.960
I think there's a giant gap between the understanding that you have and the

2035
01:07:07.961 --> 01:07:12.340
understanding that the average person has and this could be a real problem and

2036
01:07:12.341 --> 01:07:14.890
trying to expand this platform.

2037
01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:15.281
Well,

2038
01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:15.820
we have to,

2039
01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.020
to inform him.

2040
01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:17.910
I got to tell you though,

2041
01:07:17.911 --> 01:07:18.101
Joe,

2042
01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:19.120
when I say this to people,

2043
01:07:19.121 --> 01:07:19.511
they're like,

2044
01:07:19.511 --> 01:07:20.500
that makes perfect.

2045
01:07:20.501 --> 01:07:21.800
So that does make perfect sense.

2046
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:22.960
That's what scary about it.

2047
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:23.950
But I'm not,

2048
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:25.510
I'm not disagreeing with you in any way,

2049
01:07:25.511 --> 01:07:26.170
shape or form.

2050
01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:26.370
I'm,

2051
01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:27.910
I'm just thinking man,

2052
01:07:27.911 --> 01:07:29.080
for young kids,

2053
01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:30.310
for young kids and you know,

2054
01:07:30.311 --> 01:07:30.911
you're a parent.

2055
01:07:30.911 --> 01:07:31.600
I'm a parent.

2056
01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.170
But what,

2057
01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:33.790
so our education system,

2058
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:34.840
um,

2059
01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.160
has a lot to be desired.

2060
01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:37.870
And one of the things I'm saying is like,

2061
01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:38.280
uh,

2062
01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:42.370
is it's making all these kids think that college is the end all be all and it is

2063
01:07:42.371 --> 01:07:43.204
not.

2064
01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:45.790
And so that's one issue is that,

2065
01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:46.480
uh,

2066
01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.920
we need to try and prepare kids for different kinds of paths instead of saying

2067
01:07:50.921 --> 01:07:51.311
college,

2068
01:07:51.311 --> 01:07:51.641
College,

2069
01:07:51.641 --> 01:07:52.474
college,

2070
01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:54.160
because they're going to college,

2071
01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.920
they're getting loaded up with record levels of debt.

2072
01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:59.260
College has gone two and a half times more expensive,

2073
01:07:59.261 --> 01:08:01.210
even though it has not gone two and a half times better.

2074
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:02.230
Uh,

2075
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:05.730
and the reason why it's gotten so expensive is because they've just gotten

2076
01:08:05.770 --> 01:08:07.360
really bloated administratively.

2077
01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:08.680
And what would you do about that?

2078
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:09.010
Like,

2079
01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:09.311
you know,

2080
01:08:09.311 --> 01:08:14.311
Bernie Sanders wants to have some sort of a free college free university.

2081
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:15.411
Yeah.

2082
01:08:15.411 --> 01:08:15.531
They,

2083
01:08:15.531 --> 01:08:15.811
the,

2084
01:08:15.811 --> 01:08:17.540
he wants to do it across the board,

2085
01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:20.030
have education to be 100% free.

2086
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:21.380
I mean,

2087
01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:21.621
look,

2088
01:08:21.621 --> 01:08:22.990
I love that on paper I,

2089
01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:27.050
one of the things that I hate is talking to my friends about college debt.

2090
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:31.130
You know friends that are in their thirties and forties is this following them

2091
01:08:31.131 --> 01:08:31.490
around?

2092
01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:31.761
Yeah,

2093
01:08:31.761 --> 01:08:32.120
it just,

2094
01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.750
it just stays with them like a wet blanket that you can never get out of.

2095
01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:37.730
I used to call my school loans,

2096
01:08:37.731 --> 01:08:38.331
my mistress,

2097
01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:41.080
cause I was writing a check to like another family and another town.

2098
01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:41.511
I was like,

2099
01:08:41.511 --> 01:08:42.470
I hope they're enjoying themselves.

2100
01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.550
It's like I think like $900 above to buy loans.

2101
01:08:46.551 --> 01:08:50.210
And what's crazy is that if something devastating happens to you and any other

2102
01:08:50.211 --> 01:08:52.580
form you can file for bankruptcy,

2103
01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:56.300
but you never escape your student loans no matter what happens to you.

2104
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:58.340
That was just some lobbying on the part of the,

2105
01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.630
the financial companies,

2106
01:08:59.631 --> 01:08:59.841
man,

2107
01:08:59.841 --> 01:09:01.850
there's a lot of the crap out of it that is dirty,

2108
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:02.990
that's really dirty.

2109
01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:08.020
When you think about how many people that run corporations that have racked up,

2110
01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:12.350
I mean just think about what happened with the savings and loan crisis lately,

2111
01:09:12.351 --> 01:09:12.710
man.

2112
01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:14.870
And those guys skated.

2113
01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:15.793
Woo.

2114
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:17.840
The vast majority have,

2115
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:20.000
they're carrying around zero,

2116
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.740
zero burden from that.

2117
01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.820
The vast majority,

2118
01:09:22.821 --> 01:09:24.050
no one went to jail step.

2119
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:29.110
A few people in a really anybody real criminals like Bernie Madoff went to jail.

2120
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:29.931
You know,

2121
01:09:29.931 --> 01:09:31.110
a few people went to jail.

2122
01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.690
But that's about it.

2123
01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:33.501
You know,

2124
01:09:33.501 --> 01:09:36.170
you'd have to be a real fucking thief to go to jail.

2125
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:38.360
And these people that just,

2126
01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:43.620
they did this and got away with it and profited and redistributed all this money

2127
01:09:43.621 --> 01:09:45.110
into their own personal accounts and,

2128
01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.120
and stop the whole economy sideways.

2129
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:50.300
But heaven forbid you take out a bunch of school loans and then things go south.

2130
01:09:50.301 --> 01:09:51.140
Like you can't get out of it.

2131
01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:51.770
I mean,

2132
01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:55.460
I know a guy who's in his fifties who's an ophthalmologist,

2133
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:57.590
who's a deeply in debt still.

2134
01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:58.810
So amazing.

2135
01:09:58.810 --> 01:09:59.030
Yeah,

2136
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.811
it is crazy.

2137
01:09:59.811 --> 01:10:01.700
And if you look at it just economically,

2138
01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:05.690
it's a massive burden on people starting businesses,

2139
01:10:05.691 --> 01:10:06.890
starting families,

2140
01:10:06.891 --> 01:10:08.990
buying homes instead of hospital with their parents.

2141
01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:09.830
Is it possible?

2142
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:11.240
It's possible to fix for sure.

2143
01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:16.460
So the first thing you do is you go to the people that are currently in a debt

2144
01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:17.211
and say,

2145
01:10:17.211 --> 01:10:17.481
look,

2146
01:10:17.481 --> 01:10:20.270
we're going to give you a path out and there are ways to do it.

2147
01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:20.870
Uh,

2148
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:21.111
you know,

2149
01:10:21.111 --> 01:10:22.520
you can have a payment plan.

2150
01:10:22.521 --> 01:10:26.060
One of the things I'm proposing it as like a 10 by 10 where if you commit 10% of

2151
01:10:26.061 --> 01:10:27.740
your wages for 10 years and you're debt free,

2152
01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:29.870
and that means like if you're not making a lot of money,

2153
01:10:29.871 --> 01:10:31.250
then you can save a whole lot.

2154
01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:35.560
And the schools at this point have long since forgotten about this,

2155
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:36.201
these loans,

2156
01:10:36.201 --> 01:10:37.610
cause they got paid off already.

2157
01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:40.880
This is just these financial companies that are holding the loans.

2158
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:43.070
That's important for people to understand because people think,

2159
01:10:43.071 --> 01:10:44.450
well if you don't pay them in,

2160
01:10:44.451 --> 01:10:45.710
the colleges are going to go away.

2161
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:45.981
No,

2162
01:10:45.981 --> 01:10:46.191
no.

2163
01:10:46.191 --> 01:10:47.690
So if you're the government,

2164
01:10:47.691 --> 01:10:48.201
you can be like,

2165
01:10:48.201 --> 01:10:49.400
hey loan loan company.

2166
01:10:49.401 --> 01:10:50.234
Guess what?

2167
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.740
Good News.

2168
01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:51.580
We're to like take this out.

2169
01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.270
It's a stimulus because like you said,

2170
01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.030
we've done a lot of things that we're supposed to be a stimulus,

2171
01:10:56.031 --> 01:10:58.760
like give $4 trillion to the banks and be like,

2172
01:10:58.761 --> 01:10:59.930
that'll stimulate the economy.

2173
01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:03.860
Nothing's going to stimulate the economy better than getting student loans off

2174
01:11:03.861 --> 01:11:06.200
the backs of freaking young people because they'll actually do what they're

2175
01:11:06.201 --> 01:11:06.801
supposed to do,

2176
01:11:06.801 --> 01:11:08.450
which is I actually spend money,

2177
01:11:08.451 --> 01:11:11.570
the economy take chances to take chances and start businesses.

2178
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:12.140
And the rest of it,

2179
01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:12.740
I mean,

2180
01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:16.800
one of the reasons why our business formation rates are at multi decade lows

2181
01:11:16.801 --> 01:11:20.460
that we are up to one point $5 trillion in school debt.

2182
01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.200
It's like 38 k ahead.

2183
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:27.500
That was like a hundred billion in like 1999 so we've like gone up 15 x since

2184
01:11:28.411 --> 01:11:29.940
then and it's crippling us.

2185
01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:30.900
It's like insane.

2186
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:33.510
Anyone who thinks that that's not burdening the economy,

2187
01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:34.520
I mean you just got to so,

2188
01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:36.000
so president Yang will be like,

2189
01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:36.541
hey guys,

2190
01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:37.231
it's a stimulus,

2191
01:11:37.231 --> 01:11:40.260
but this time it's a stimulus that people were going to forgive some of the

2192
01:11:40.261 --> 01:11:42.840
student loan debt because half that stuff was generated immorally morally.

2193
01:11:42.841 --> 01:11:43.230
Anyway,

2194
01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:44.490
a lot of it was just schools,

2195
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.570
you know,

2196
01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:47.830
lying about it.

2197
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:49.020
Does it get people in the door?

2198
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:51.870
The second thing you do is you go to the schools and say,

2199
01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:52.351
hey guys,

2200
01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:54.540
why aren't you two and a half times more expensive than you used to be?

2201
01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.310
That's kind of weird cause like as far as I can tell,

2202
01:11:56.311 --> 01:12:01.230
there's been no massive quality change and the reason is that they've hired a

2203
01:12:01.231 --> 01:12:02.040
lot of administrators.

2204
01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.480
It has not gone to faculty.

2205
01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:05.310
It has not gone to facilities.

2206
01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:09.870
It has gone to just administrative access and bloat and then say,

2207
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.231
okay,

2208
01:12:10.231 --> 01:12:11.190
you can do whatever you want,

2209
01:12:11.191 --> 01:12:12.870
but if you want access to federal loans,

2210
01:12:12.871 --> 01:12:14.880
which they all rely upon for their life's blood,

2211
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:15.391
like without it,

2212
01:12:15.391 --> 01:12:16.224
they die.

2213
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:19.260
If you want your students have access to federal loans,

2214
01:12:19.261 --> 01:12:24.261
you have to bring your administrator to student ratio in line with what it was

2215
01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:29.580
like in the 1990s and then the schools would scream bloody murder.

2216
01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.473
They'd be like,

2217
01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.051
I can't do that.

2218
01:12:31.051 --> 01:12:31.651
That's impossible.

2219
01:12:31.651 --> 01:12:31.981
And you'd be like,

2220
01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:32.341
well,

2221
01:12:32.341 --> 01:12:33.720
I have a feeling you're going to figure it out,

2222
01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:35.080
that they,

2223
01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.610
they would start bringing it down and you would realize it doesn't impact the

2224
01:12:38.611 --> 01:12:39.810
student experience at all.

2225
01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:44.700
Like I understand it because I've run a large nonprofit organization that I had

2226
01:12:44.701 --> 01:12:48.690
started and your very natural tendency is just to hire excellent people.

2227
01:12:48.691 --> 01:12:49.530
And then before you know it,

2228
01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:50.100
you're like,

2229
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:50.970
have excellent people,

2230
01:12:50.971 --> 01:12:51.240
like,

2231
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:51.690
you know,

2232
01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:52.740
vice deans of everything.

2233
01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.550
But then over time that ends up building a very large cost structure,

2234
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:57.150
uh,

2235
01:12:57.150 --> 01:12:58.680
that gets passed along to the public.

2236
01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:01.080
So you'd bring the costs down.

2237
01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.310
Now you've said before,

2238
01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:03.800
Bernie's like free college for everyone.

2239
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:07.830
The problem with that solution is it pretends that college solves the employment

2240
01:13:07.831 --> 01:13:08.880
problems of young people.

2241
01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:12.000
And anyone who's coming out of college knows that that's not real.

2242
01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.790
The underemployment rate for recent college graduates today,

2243
01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:15.750
it's 44%.

2244
01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.040
So you have like a 50,

2245
01:13:17.041 --> 01:13:18.890
50 shot if you come out of college or doing a job,

2246
01:13:18.891 --> 01:13:23.891
it doesn't really require a degree and 94% of new jobs created right now our gig

2247
01:13:24.271 --> 01:13:27.990
temporary or contract or jobs that don't have real paths forward or health care

2248
01:13:27.991 --> 01:13:28.980
benefits of the rest of it.

2249
01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:29.551
Yeah.

2250
01:13:29.551 --> 01:13:30.241
I was reading something,

2251
01:13:30.241 --> 01:13:30.470
something

2252
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:31.010
<v 2>about,</v>

2253
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:31.520
um,

2254
01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:36.520
people actually it might've been in that a book that I was just telling you

2255
01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:40.010
about Yuval Noah Harari.

2256
01:13:40.011 --> 01:13:40.251
Yeah.

2257
01:13:40.251 --> 01:13:41.520
21st century and yeah,

2258
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:42.703
it was,

2259
01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.600
I would say that guy's name wrong.

2260
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:45.770
It's a tricky name.

2261
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:47.610
You evolve Noah Herati yeah.

2262
01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:48.320
Uh,

2263
01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.790
21 lessons for 21st century.

2264
01:13:49.791 --> 01:13:54.791
I think he was talking about how many people plan on not being in the same job

2265
01:13:56.691 --> 01:14:01.370
in 10 years because that job won't exist anymore versus what it used to be used

2266
01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:01.581
to be.

2267
01:14:01.581 --> 01:14:04.540
The people would think that they were going to get a job and they would stay

2268
01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:05.150
with that job.

2269
01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:05.411
Yeah,

2270
01:14:05.411 --> 01:14:05.750
I know.

2271
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:09.440
And now they're planning that they're going to have to move,

2272
01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:11.620
that they're not going to be able to keep the job.

2273
01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:14.170
And as automation kicks in,

2274
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:15.980
this is obviously going to bottleneck.

2275
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:16.863
It's gonna get even,

2276
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.950
it's going to give him worse.

2277
01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:18.430
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2278
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:18.611
yeah,

2279
01:14:18.611 --> 01:14:19.444
completely.

2280
01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:23.620
So the ideal is that you end up training young people to be really,

2281
01:14:23.621 --> 01:14:27.280
really adaptable and have low cost structures and just be able to,

2282
01:14:27.281 --> 01:14:27.490
you know,

2283
01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:28.420
become entrepreneurs.

2284
01:14:28.421 --> 01:14:30.970
And I spent seven years trying to train young people to do just that.

2285
01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:35.560
But one of the things I've discovered is that we're over emphasizing college and

2286
01:14:35.561 --> 01:14:39.640
what were under emphasizing his technical vocational and apprenticeship work.

2287
01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:41.020
Because a lot of that work,

2288
01:14:41.021 --> 01:14:41.501
believe it or not,

2289
01:14:41.501 --> 01:14:42.760
it's actually really hard to automate.

2290
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.930
Like uh,

2291
01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:44.260
you know,

2292
01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:47.680
we're not going to automate an air conditioning repair person or plumber anytime

2293
01:14:47.681 --> 01:14:49.510
soon and for sure craftsmen,

2294
01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:53.080
people who build things and as good for your mental health.

2295
01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:53.380
Yeah.

2296
01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:54.370
And a bunch of other things.

2297
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:55.331
So right now,

2298
01:14:55.331 --> 01:14:59.410
only 6% of American high school students are in technical or vocational training

2299
01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:00.251
in Germany.

2300
01:15:00.251 --> 01:15:01.300
That's 59%.

2301
01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:02.620
Give you a sense of what the,

2302
01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:06.640
the gap can be to what we're doing is we're overprescribing college were saying

2303
01:15:06.641 --> 01:15:07.001
college,

2304
01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:07.271
College,

2305
01:15:07.271 --> 01:15:08.110
college for everyone.

2306
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:12.040
It's not really working that well and then we're still treating people who are

2307
01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:15.130
working in trades and everything is somehow uh,

2308
01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:15.611
you know,

2309
01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:19.060
like not in great careers when a lot of those careers are actually really

2310
01:15:19.061 --> 01:15:22.000
awesome and they pay great and that people enjoy them.

2311
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:23.230
They're persistent.

2312
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:25.510
So right now we're going to automate away.

2313
01:15:25.511 --> 01:15:30.511
It's a lot easier to automate away a lot of repetitive cognitive work than it is

2314
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:36.190
a non repetitive manual work because like actual robot digits,

2315
01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:36.461
you know,

2316
01:15:36.461 --> 01:15:39.580
it's like if you can imagine what it would take to have a robot plumber like

2317
01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:40.211
coming to your house,

2318
01:15:40.211 --> 01:15:41.560
I mean that stuff's really,

2319
01:15:41.561 --> 01:15:44.440
really tricky and there's a lot of fine motor work.

2320
01:15:44.441 --> 01:15:47.710
They have to like unscrew pipes and like stuff that stuff's not going to get

2321
01:15:47.711 --> 01:15:48.970
automated for a long time.

2322
01:15:49.190 --> 01:15:50.710
You know what is going to get automated?

2323
01:15:50.711 --> 01:15:54.400
A lot of like entry level cognitive tasks because a lot of journalism tasks,

2324
01:15:54.401 --> 01:15:57.700
a lot of bookkeeping and a lot of stuff that college graduates think they're

2325
01:15:57.701 --> 01:16:00.820
going to get a job in and then those jobs are going to disappear.

2326
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:04.870
I was a corporate attorney for those five unhappy months and my friends are

2327
01:16:04.871 --> 01:16:05.704
working on

2328
01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.340
AI that can automate away a lot of basic legal work,

2329
01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:09.971
you know,

2330
01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:10.660
so these colleges,

2331
01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:11.411
these college grads,

2332
01:16:11.411 --> 01:16:11.621
they're like,

2333
01:16:11.621 --> 01:16:12.550
oh snap,

2334
01:16:12.551 --> 01:16:13.141
don't know what to do man.

2335
01:16:13.141 --> 01:16:13.871
I'll go to law school.

2336
01:16:13.871 --> 01:16:17.390
Didn't like load up with another 120 k in debt and then like the,

2337
01:16:17.391 --> 01:16:19.060
the legal jobs are not going to be there for him.

2338
01:16:19.210 --> 01:16:22.720
<v 2>It's often the problem of the parents giving them pressure to go into college as</v>

2339
01:16:22.721 --> 01:16:24.550
well because they didn't want the kid to become a loser.

2340
01:16:24.551 --> 01:16:25.270
And if the kid,

2341
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:27.790
you know like where I grew up in Boston,

2342
01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.320
if you went into the trades,

2343
01:16:29.321 --> 01:16:32.860
if you abandoned like the idea of higher learning,

2344
01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:36.460
going to college and just went right into like learning to be a carpenter or

2345
01:16:36.461 --> 01:16:37.091
something like that.

2346
01:16:37.091 --> 01:16:38.110
People look at you like,

2347
01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:39.010
ah,

2348
01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:40.480
he's sold yourself short.

2349
01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:45.130
But there's so many people that I know that went to school that just got

2350
01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:48.580
university degrees and then they got out and they were fucked.

2351
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:49.120
Yeah.

2352
01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:49.551
I mean it's,

2353
01:16:49.551 --> 01:16:50.410
it's so common.

2354
01:16:50.411 --> 01:16:55.030
It's so common that they thought that there was going to be this path and this

2355
01:16:55.031 --> 01:16:56.020
path to sit and exist.

2356
01:16:56.021 --> 01:16:57.250
Once they got out or it was,

2357
01:16:57.251 --> 01:16:57.791
it was far,

2358
01:16:57.791 --> 01:16:59.950
far more difficult than it was then.

2359
01:16:59.951 --> 01:17:00.784
They were led to believe.

2360
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.991
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2361
01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:01.711
If you look at it,

2362
01:17:01.711 --> 01:17:05.610
about 32% of Americans graduated from college right now and that level has been

2363
01:17:05.611 --> 01:17:07.590
more or less constant for a long time.

2364
01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:08.491
It's not like,

2365
01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:08.791
Hey,

2366
01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:10.880
I've another 20% I could get into college.

2367
01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.500
Like right now the college completion rate in six years,

2368
01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:19.460
about 59% so like four out of 10 people who start college are not graduating in

2369
01:17:19.461 --> 01:17:21.770
six years and a lot of them are just not going to finish ever.

2370
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:27.160
So like the people that have other pads available,

2371
01:17:27.701 --> 01:17:29.120
then we have to build those paths up.

2372
01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:32.420
And this is one reason why I'm so into the freedom dividend instead of something

2373
01:17:32.421 --> 01:17:35.510
like free college cause why would you subsidize something that only the top

2374
01:17:35.511 --> 01:17:37.340
third of the population is going to use?

2375
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:38.241
You know,

2376
01:17:38.241 --> 01:17:38.751
an end.

2377
01:17:38.751 --> 01:17:40.820
It's a highly inefficient costly system anyway.

2378
01:17:40.821 --> 01:17:42.140
Like counting money into that.

2379
01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.980
You're much better off putting a thousand bucks a month to every 18 year olds

2380
01:17:45.981 --> 01:17:46.760
hands.

2381
01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:47.900
Didn't they go to college?

2382
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:49.420
Great colleges partially paid for.

2383
01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:50.360
They go to trade school,

2384
01:17:50.361 --> 01:17:51.950
great trade schools partially paid for.

2385
01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:53.390
They start their own business,

2386
01:17:53.391 --> 01:17:54.530
they do something creative,

2387
01:17:54.531 --> 01:17:55.880
like they want to do something to help.

2388
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:57.290
That's great too.

2389
01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.710
Like you can actually start building more varied paths and make it so that

2390
01:18:00.711 --> 01:18:04.130
people don't feel like I need to get into this institution or else my life's

2391
01:18:04.131 --> 01:18:04.940
going to be over.

2392
01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:05.121
Now.

2393
01:18:05.121 --> 01:18:08.660
What are the primary concerns that people have outside of what you're talking

2394
01:18:08.661 --> 01:18:10.430
about so far with automation,

2395
01:18:10.431 --> 01:18:12.080
taking away jobs and,

2396
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:13.491
and you know,

2397
01:18:13.491 --> 01:18:15.050
student loan debt and these things.

2398
01:18:15.051 --> 01:18:17.270
What are the other things that you think you're going to have to talk about in

2399
01:18:17.271 --> 01:18:19.640
order to get people to take you really seriously?

2400
01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:20.751
I know a,

2401
01:18:20.751 --> 01:18:21.021
I mean,

2402
01:18:21.021 --> 01:18:21.831
the hot button issues,

2403
01:18:21.831 --> 01:18:22.611
you know what they all are,

2404
01:18:22.611 --> 01:18:26.390
it's like immigration and climate change is a really big one.

2405
01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:27.230
Uh,

2406
01:18:27.230 --> 01:18:27.771
and you know,

2407
01:18:27.771 --> 01:18:27.981
I mean,

2408
01:18:27.981 --> 01:18:28.910
I can talk about those,

2409
01:18:28.911 --> 01:18:29.510
uh,

2410
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:30.320
at length.

2411
01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:30.501
Um,

2412
01:18:30.501 --> 01:18:30.820
so my,

2413
01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:34.520
my father and mother met as immigrants from Taiwan at UC Berkeley.

2414
01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.860
My father is a phd in physics.

2415
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:41.510
He generated 69 us patents for GE and IBM over his career.

2416
01:18:41.511 --> 01:18:44.720
So I'd like immigrants are awesome immigrants come in and you know,

2417
01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:48.590
it's like big stuff happen for big American companies.

2418
01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:49.191
Uh,

2419
01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:52.580
so I'm very pro immigrant and I think people would expect that just to look at

2420
01:18:52.581 --> 01:18:53.120
me.

2421
01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:53.420
Um,

2422
01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:58.220
and so what I say is first it makes no sense to educate international students

2423
01:18:58.221 --> 01:19:00.800
and US universities and then send them home to compete against us.

2424
01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:01.880
That makes no sense.

2425
01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.440
Like if they're going to come to the US and study,

2426
01:19:03.441 --> 01:19:05.600
we should just staple a green card to the diploma and be like,

2427
01:19:05.601 --> 01:19:06.310
Hey,

2428
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:07.250
you got a diploma,

2429
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:07.971
great news.

2430
01:19:07.971 --> 01:19:08.960
You can stay here and work.

2431
01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:13.640
Because I personally know tons of awesome internationals who would definitely

2432
01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:18.260
help make the US more dynamic and competitive that go home and start the

2433
01:19:18.261 --> 01:19:19.100
companies there and you're like,

2434
01:19:19.101 --> 01:19:19.701
oh no.

2435
01:19:19.701 --> 01:19:20.620
Like how that happens.

2436
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:22.123
Uh,

2437
01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.100
that's great for people come from a privileged background who has the

2438
01:19:25.101 --> 01:19:27.650
opportunity to come here and become educated.

2439
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:32.730
But what about people who are poor or trying to make it here from South America

2440
01:19:32.731 --> 01:19:37.731
owns want Amala there are three paths available to you for the approximately 12

2441
01:19:38.210 --> 01:19:38.901
million people who are here,

2442
01:19:38.901 --> 01:19:39.650
undocumented,

2443
01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:42.770
many of whom from Mexico and Latin America would not like the,

2444
01:19:42.771 --> 01:19:43.011
you know,

2445
01:19:43.011 --> 01:19:43.371
frankly,

2446
01:19:43.371 --> 01:19:44.204
like they're not,

2447
01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:44.930
um,

2448
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:46.970
the profile I just described for the most part.

2449
01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.160
So there are three approaches.

2450
01:19:49.161 --> 01:19:53.060
Number one is you can pretend to deport them because it's completely unfeasible

2451
01:19:53.061 --> 01:19:54.560
to deport 12 million people.

2452
01:19:54.561 --> 01:19:57.080
I mean like whole regional economies would collapse.

2453
01:19:57.081 --> 01:19:58.400
Like you can't do it practically.

2454
01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.390
Like it doesn't make any sense.

2455
01:19:59.391 --> 01:20:00.210
Right?

2456
01:20:00.210 --> 01:20:00.620
Um,

2457
01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:04.760
number two is you do nothing,

2458
01:20:04.761 --> 01:20:05.720
which is our current paths.

2459
01:20:06.170 --> 01:20:09.180
And then you have massive problems too cause they're constantly interacting with

2460
01:20:09.181 --> 01:20:13.260
your schools and your hospitals and they're getting into car accidents and like,

2461
01:20:13.290 --> 01:20:13.501
you know,

2462
01:20:13.501 --> 01:20:15.060
it's like just not knowing who the heck is,

2463
01:20:15.061 --> 01:20:19.770
who is an untenable situation for any advanced society.

2464
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:23.550
So number three is you create a pathway to citizenship and then you integrate

2465
01:20:23.551 --> 01:20:24.780
them into society.

2466
01:20:24.781 --> 01:20:29.781
But it's like a long term path that takes a number of years and you need to keep

2467
01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:34.791
your nose clean and pay taxes and work hard and do most to be the most feasible.

2468
01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:35.820
Yeah.

2469
01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.140
And so that's where we should go.

2470
01:20:37.141 --> 01:20:40.980
And some Republicans were on board with that until they paid a political price

2471
01:20:40.981 --> 01:20:42.150
and then they ran the other direction.

2472
01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:47.820
So that is really the right path for people who are here undocumented.

2473
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.430
But I say to people a lot,

2474
01:20:50.431 --> 01:20:53.670
but the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian guy who likes math.

2475
01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.500
So Donald Trump's like build a wall.

2476
01:20:58.501 --> 01:20:59.041
And I'm like,

2477
01:20:59.041 --> 01:20:59.370
look,

2478
01:20:59.370 --> 01:20:59.670
like,

2479
01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:00.091
I mean I'm,

2480
01:21:00.091 --> 01:21:00.360
I'm,

2481
01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.310
we got enforced the a strong border,

2482
01:21:02.311 --> 01:21:05.550
like especially in a world where everyone every is getting 1000 bucks a month.

2483
01:21:05.551 --> 01:21:07.020
Like you got enforced it strong border.

2484
01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:08.490
But at the same time,

2485
01:21:08.491 --> 01:21:08.761
you know,

2486
01:21:08.761 --> 01:21:10.320
like people who are here,

2487
01:21:10.321 --> 01:21:14.340
they're making our communities a lot more entrepreneurial and dynamic.

2488
01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:17.640
Many of them mean at the high end,

2489
01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.290
half of the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are either immigrants or children of

2490
01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:20.124
immigrants.

2491
01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:20.670
Um,

2492
01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:21.430
and that's true,

2493
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.640
uh,

2494
01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:25.290
in a different way in terms of like the dynamism of these immigrant communities.

2495
01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.300
So what I say to people is like,

2496
01:21:27.330 --> 01:21:28.260
if I'm president,

2497
01:21:28.261 --> 01:21:30.660
people will see that you come to this country,

2498
01:21:30.661 --> 01:21:31.321
you work hard,

2499
01:21:31.321 --> 01:21:33.390
you're a son or daughter can become president United States.

2500
01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:37.830
Now what do you do though in this scenario that you just described?

2501
01:21:37.831 --> 01:21:42.450
If someone comes here and they don't work hard and they don't keep their nose

2502
01:21:42.451 --> 01:21:46.050
clean and they are still here and they're not a citizen yet.

2503
01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.130
Yeah.

2504
01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:47.963
So,

2505
01:21:48.090 --> 01:21:48.361
you know,

2506
01:21:48.361 --> 01:21:48.780
so then,

2507
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:53.120
then they operate in the informal economy and the way that they have ended,

2508
01:21:53.121 --> 01:21:55.020
the truth is that even if we have this pathway,

2509
01:21:55.021 --> 01:21:57.960
they're going to be a significant proportion of people who just do not trust us

2510
01:21:57.961 --> 01:21:59.670
enough to say,

2511
01:21:59.671 --> 01:21:59.881
Hey,

2512
01:21:59.881 --> 01:22:00.410
I'll be here.

2513
01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:01.650
I to like enter the pipeline.

2514
01:22:01.651 --> 01:22:02.670
There's gotta be a lot of,

2515
01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.513
uh,

2516
01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:05.280
they're gonna be a lot of people that,

2517
01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:06.000
um,

2518
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.710
don't subscribe.

2519
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:10.470
But that's where it is right now.

2520
01:22:10.471 --> 01:22:12.540
We're not making this situation actively worse.

2521
01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:17.070
We can at least improve the situation for a really significant proportion of

2522
01:22:17.071 --> 01:22:17.730
them.

2523
01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:18.030
Yeah.

2524
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:19.440
For a significant proportion of them.

2525
01:22:19.441 --> 01:22:20.131
And you know,

2526
01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:22.710
the other situation would be tax revenue.

2527
01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:25.920
How many people that are here illegally or not paying taxes.

2528
01:22:25.921 --> 01:22:27.270
I would imagine it's a,

2529
01:22:27.271 --> 01:22:28.650
an enormous number.

2530
01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:29.071
Yeah.

2531
01:22:29.071 --> 01:22:31.920
There'd be a real economic boost if we can integrate them into the formal

2532
01:22:31.921 --> 01:22:34.530
economy because there's a lot of just cash going back and forth.

2533
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:35.290
Right.

2534
01:22:35.290 --> 01:22:37.920
And that's what I'm saying is that a lot of people might decide,

2535
01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:38.161
hey,

2536
01:22:38.161 --> 01:22:38.671
you know what,

2537
01:22:38.671 --> 01:22:41.430
I don't even want to be a citizen because of I'm a citizen and I have to pay

2538
01:22:41.431 --> 01:22:44.970
taxes or I could work as a laborer or work as a,

2539
01:22:44.971 --> 01:22:45.804
you know,

2540
01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:47.520
on construction sites or whatever.

2541
01:22:47.521 --> 01:22:50.460
Whoever's willing to hire them and work for free.

2542
01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:51.030
Yes.

2543
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:52.680
Work rather with a free taxes.

2544
01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:53.041
Yeah.

2545
01:22:53.041 --> 01:22:53.551
And yeah,

2546
01:22:53.551 --> 01:22:56.550
and so I mean that that would still be going on like that.

2547
01:22:56.551 --> 01:22:57.600
There are limits to,

2548
01:22:57.601 --> 01:22:58.010
you know,

2549
01:22:58.010 --> 01:23:01.600
like what sort of appeal you can have in terms of having people raise their

2550
01:23:01.601 --> 01:23:01.980
hand,

2551
01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:04.590
have a path to real prosperity,

2552
01:23:04.591 --> 01:23:06.520
have a real path to citizenship

2553
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.390
<v 2>would be very nice.</v>

2554
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:08.400
<v 0>And it'd be enormous for them.</v>

2555
01:23:08.401 --> 01:23:11.520
Cause a lot of them have kids and a lot of them kids who don't know no other

2556
01:23:11.521 --> 01:23:12.091
life but,

2557
01:23:12.091 --> 01:23:12.924
but here.

2558
01:23:13.050 --> 01:23:17.280
So another issue I think you'll like that comes up on the campaign trail is what

2559
01:23:17.281 --> 01:23:18.360
to do about marijuana.

2560
01:23:18.361 --> 01:23:19.880
And I'm for full legalization,

2561
01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:23.310
remove it from the federal controlled substance list.

2562
01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.210
And I would go a step further and pardon everyone who's in jail for a low level

2563
01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:31.080
nonviolent drug offense because it makes no sense to me to have people behind

2564
01:23:31.081 --> 01:23:33.660
bars for things that are legal in parts of the country.

2565
01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:39.050
So my plan as president is on April 20th of 2021 I'm going to mass pardon in

2566
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:45.060
everyone who's in jail for nonviolent drug related offense.

2567
01:23:45.061 --> 01:23:47.520
I'm going to high five them on the way out and I'm gonna be a very popular man

2568
01:23:47.521 --> 01:23:47.950
that day.

2569
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:49.620
Going to be a lot of travel and the high five,

2570
01:23:49.621 --> 01:23:50.454
all those folks,

2571
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:54.180
I know I'm going to have to go to a lot of places and high five but I really

2572
01:23:54.181 --> 01:23:55.550
want to high five them generally.

2573
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:56.251
Yeah,

2574
01:23:56.251 --> 01:23:58.470
I mean that would be the funnest freaking occasion.

2575
01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.220
Uh,

2576
01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:00.053
so,

2577
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.330
you know,

2578
01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:04.230
that's something that comes up that to me it's obvious that marijuana,

2579
01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:05.520
um,

2580
01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.090
you know,

2581
01:24:06.090 --> 01:24:07.110
is an important,

2582
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:08.183
uh,

2583
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:10.330
remedy for many people who are like in,

2584
01:24:10.331 --> 01:24:11.164
in various,

2585
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:12.263
um,

2586
01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:13.413
uh,

2587
01:24:13.650 --> 01:24:15.960
struggling with various like health problems and everything else.

2588
01:24:15.961 --> 01:24:17.670
I have friends who were in that situation,

2589
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.900
um,

2590
01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:21.060
and that it's certainly much less dangerous than,

2591
01:24:21.061 --> 01:24:21.631
for example,

2592
01:24:21.631 --> 01:24:24.820
some of the opiates that have been getting prescribed for the same same things.

2593
01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:25.541
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2594
01:24:25.541 --> 01:24:26.920
What do you do about that?

2595
01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:28.870
That's a question that I have because,

2596
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.350
um,

2597
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:34.350
I was just reading something about some new approved drug that's more powerful

2598
01:24:35.621 --> 01:24:36.454
than fentanyl,

2599
01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:39.040
which seems to me to be completely insane.

2600
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:41.830
Like we already have fentanyl and you just,

2601
01:24:41.831 --> 01:24:42.280
you,

2602
01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:44.000
you make a mistake on what,

2603
01:24:44.010 --> 01:24:44.560
you know,

2604
01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:47.740
one of the things that happens with people that overdose is especially old

2605
01:24:47.741 --> 01:24:51.700
people that are in pain when they're using fentanyl or using any kind of opiate

2606
01:24:51.701 --> 01:24:52.534
on a regular basis.

2607
01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:55.600
They sometimes forget if they took it and,

2608
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:56.200
you know,

2609
01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:56.500
look,

2610
01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:57.610
it's a fucking opion.

2611
01:24:57.611 --> 01:24:58.690
I mean those,

2612
01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:59.980
they're very powerful.

2613
01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:03.400
And if you're high on that stuff and you forget whether or not you took it and

2614
01:25:03.401 --> 01:25:04.360
you go and take it again,

2615
01:25:04.361 --> 01:25:05.130
you're dead.

2616
01:25:05.130 --> 01:25:05.530
Yes.

2617
01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:06.101
And that,

2618
01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:08.380
that's a giant issue there too.

2619
01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:09.490
Damn powerful.

2620
01:25:09.491 --> 01:25:13.060
And the idea that you need something that's more powerful than that seems to be

2621
01:25:13.061 --> 01:25:13.894
insane.

2622
01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:14.741
<v 0>I agree with you.</v>

2623
01:25:14.741 --> 01:25:14.941
It's,

2624
01:25:14.941 --> 01:25:16.090
it's irresponsible.

2625
01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:20.920
The entire opiate crisis was generated in part by the fact that the feds let

2626
01:25:20.921 --> 01:25:25.720
Purdue Pharma just go crazy prescribing hundreds of thousands of oxycontin

2627
01:25:25.721 --> 01:25:27.850
prescriptions and that company,

2628
01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:32.170
that company got fined 635 million would sounds like a lot until you realize

2629
01:25:32.171 --> 01:25:33.610
they made like 16 billion.

2630
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.991
So,

2631
01:25:34.991 --> 01:25:36.130
and those drop in the bucket.

2632
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:36.311
Yeah.

2633
01:25:36.311 --> 01:25:36.671
So those,

2634
01:25:36.671 --> 01:25:39.460
those people are now some of the richest people in the country on the backs of

2635
01:25:39.461 --> 01:25:40.330
American communities.

2636
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:42.070
And it just keeps morphing.

2637
01:25:42.071 --> 01:25:44.080
Cause I went from oxy to heroin defense,

2638
01:25:44.081 --> 01:25:44.501
Anil,

2639
01:25:44.501 --> 01:25:47.230
and then you have people who are struggling with this addiction.

2640
01:25:47.231 --> 01:25:48.064
So to me,

2641
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:49.090
uh,

2642
01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:52.150
to me it was federal negligence that I'll unleashed this plague.

2643
01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:55.270
I mean you got to hold the Sadler's and Purdue Pharma accountable.

2644
01:25:55.271 --> 01:25:58.450
Cause literally now they're profiting from one of the treatment drugs.

2645
01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:00.730
It's really obscene what they're doing.

2646
01:26:00.731 --> 01:26:01.241
And they're just like,

2647
01:26:01.241 --> 01:26:02.050
hey,

2648
01:26:02.050 --> 01:26:06.500
my non addictive wonder drug turns out it caused a super plague of lethal

2649
01:26:06.501 --> 01:26:09.230
addiction for a hundreds of thousands of Americans.

2650
01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:11.160
But now I'm going to sell you a new drug and you know,

2651
01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:12.980
try and make money on the backend too.

2652
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:18.170
So you've got to get as much money as we possibly can from that family in

2653
01:26:18.171 --> 01:26:19.004
particular.

2654
01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:19.471
Uh,

2655
01:26:19.471 --> 01:26:24.060
but then you have to make resources available and try and get people to,

2656
01:26:24.061 --> 01:26:25.670
to depend on these drugs.

2657
01:26:25.671 --> 01:26:28.400
Less like on the front end from the doctor end.

2658
01:26:28.401 --> 01:26:28.761
It's just like,

2659
01:26:28.761 --> 01:26:28.971
look,

2660
01:26:28.971 --> 01:26:32.240
why are you prescribing like the these opiates when like was a doctor I quoted

2661
01:26:32.241 --> 01:26:37.241
in my book where he's like you have never seen a lethality rate for something

2662
01:26:37.821 --> 01:26:39.980
prescribed for like a non life threatening condition.

2663
01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:43.190
It's like literally like a nontrivial percentage of people you prescribe an

2664
01:26:43.191 --> 01:26:43.880
opiate to.

2665
01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.220
We'll be dead in five years.

2666
01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:50.450
And the thing that came to you and you know in the hospital wasn't life

2667
01:26:50.451 --> 01:26:51.284
threatening.

2668
01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.280
It makes no sense.

2669
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:53.223
It's crazy.

2670
01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:56.240
So we have to make treatment resources available.

2671
01:26:56.241 --> 01:26:57.680
But this is a very human problem.

2672
01:26:57.710 --> 01:26:59.000
It's not a money problem.

2673
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.631
Like you know,

2674
01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:01.610
you can throw money at some problems and it works.

2675
01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:05.750
This thing we should throw money at to try and give people a fighting chance,

2676
01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:09.170
but then you have to support the people coming out cause it's a brutal,

2677
01:27:09.171 --> 01:27:11.640
brutal process trying to uh,

2678
01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:14.120
become whole and healthy if you're an addict.

2679
01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.970
<v 2>It is an unbelievably brutal process and it's,</v>

2680
01:27:17.290 --> 01:27:21.380
I have family members that are affected by it and people with hurt backs that

2681
01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:23.660
got on these pills and next thing you know,

2682
01:27:23.661 --> 01:27:24.680
they can't get off of them.

2683
01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:25.580
And it's just,

2684
01:27:25.581 --> 01:27:27.380
it's devastating and it's so common.

2685
01:27:27.381 --> 01:27:29.990
It's just all through our country and to everyone,

2686
01:27:29.991 --> 01:27:31.040
no prescribing you for nothing.

2687
01:27:31.041 --> 01:27:32.180
I hadn't my nose fixed.

2688
01:27:32.181 --> 01:27:34.500
I had a deviated septum and uh,

2689
01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:37.640
the doctor prescribed me two different kinds of opiates and I said,

2690
01:27:37.641 --> 01:27:38.540
I'm not in any pain.

2691
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:39.471
And he said,

2692
01:27:39.471 --> 01:27:39.650
uh,

2693
01:27:39.650 --> 01:27:39.891
yeah,

2694
01:27:39.891 --> 01:27:41.210
but you could be so here.

2695
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:41.781
And I'm like,

2696
01:27:41.781 --> 01:27:43.400
but I don't think this is a good idea.

2697
01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:43.791
I'm like,

2698
01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:44.780
I don't even want anything.

2699
01:27:45.170 --> 01:27:45.591
He goes,

2700
01:27:45.591 --> 01:27:45.741
well,

2701
01:27:45.741 --> 01:27:49.550
just take these just in case I'm on to tell you I'm not playing tough guy.

2702
01:27:49.551 --> 01:27:50.384
It just didn't hurt.

2703
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.810
Yeah,

2704
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:52.430
it was a little annoying.

2705
01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:52.820
It was like,

2706
01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.110
oh my nose feels weird,

2707
01:27:54.111 --> 01:27:56.180
but I didn't need fucking opiates.

2708
01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:57.073
Seriously man.

2709
01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.550
They're just willing like here you go,

2710
01:27:58.610 --> 01:27:58.971
come on.

2711
01:27:58.971 --> 01:27:59.790
What are you in pain?

2712
01:27:59.790 --> 01:28:00.230
You Go,

2713
01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:00.690
come on,

2714
01:28:00.690 --> 01:28:01.371
take a little of this,

2715
01:28:01.371 --> 01:28:02.204
take a little of that.

2716
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:02.711
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2717
01:28:02.711 --> 01:28:03.031
And I,

2718
01:28:03.031 --> 01:28:06.790
I have a guarantee for you that their incentives drive them more towards

2719
01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:07.870
dispensing those dragons.

2720
01:28:07.871 --> 01:28:08.710
The did not expensive.

2721
01:28:08.730 --> 01:28:09.280
Those drugs.

2722
01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:09.760
Yes.

2723
01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.850
And it's in large part because the incentive structure of our healthcare system

2724
01:28:12.851 --> 01:28:13.684
is so,

2725
01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:14.410
uh,

2726
01:28:14.410 --> 01:28:15.243
revenue oriented.

2727
01:28:15.250 --> 01:28:15.700
Yes.

2728
01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:17.260
It's like if I do more stuff,

2729
01:28:17.261 --> 01:28:18.400
but by give you more stuff,

2730
01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:19.270
I make more money.

2731
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:20.980
If I decide you don't need it,

2732
01:28:20.981 --> 01:28:21.910
I make less money.

2733
01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:25.090
And that is one of the things that's driving us all into this,

2734
01:28:25.150 --> 01:28:29.710
this unhealth is that if you went to a doctor who legitimately was like,

2735
01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:30.693
you know,

2736
01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:31.481
I don't think you need this,

2737
01:28:31.481 --> 01:28:32.440
stuff like that.

2738
01:28:32.441 --> 01:28:37.420
That would be the way many of them would see the problem if their paycheck was

2739
01:28:37.421 --> 01:28:40.480
unrelated to the amount of activity that they were doing.

2740
01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:41.590
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2741
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:42.250
Um,

2742
01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:47.200
when you look at all the issues that plague this country and you think about the

2743
01:28:47.201 --> 01:28:49.600
possibility of you actually winning and becoming president,

2744
01:28:49.601 --> 01:28:54.160
and then you look at what happens to presidents when they win and the amount of

2745
01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:57.010
just aging happens to them.

2746
01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:58.210
Do you worry about that?

2747
01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:58.480
Well,

2748
01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:58.841
first of all,

2749
01:28:58.841 --> 01:29:00.490
Asians age very well.

2750
01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:00.980
Yeah.

2751
01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:02.100
We've got that going for you

2752
01:29:02.850 --> 01:29:03.421
<v 0>that you know,</v>

2753
01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:03.681
and I'm,

2754
01:29:03.681 --> 01:29:04.710
I'm married and you know,

2755
01:29:04.711 --> 01:29:06.600
we've got two kids so I don't think she's going anywhere.

2756
01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:09.300
It can be like kind of tough for her to start over at this point.

2757
01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:10.693
Uh,

2758
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:11.071
you know,

2759
01:29:11.071 --> 01:29:12.000
I mean one of my,

2760
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:17.030
my nightmare scenarios is I win and then like I can't get stuff done the way

2761
01:29:17.851 --> 01:29:18.540
that he goes.

2762
01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:19.373
That's the fear.

2763
01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:22.800
You've talked about this too where good people go in and government,

2764
01:29:22.801 --> 01:29:26.310
he gets stuck like flies and amber because the system is just designed to keep

2765
01:29:26.311 --> 01:29:27.300
you from getting anything done.

2766
01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:30.900
But one thing I will say is that if you imagine a scenario where the Asian man

2767
01:29:30.901 --> 01:29:33.300
who wants to give everyone 1000 bucks a month becomes president,

2768
01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:37.650
the United States in 2021 everyone's going to know what how I want.

2769
01:29:37.651 --> 01:29:38.041
It will be like,

2770
01:29:38.041 --> 01:29:38.551
all right guys,

2771
01:29:38.551 --> 01:29:41.910
it's dividend time and then Democrats will be like,

2772
01:29:41.911 --> 01:29:42.331
yeah,

2773
01:29:42.331 --> 01:29:43.980
I like money for families.

2774
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:46.170
That's great and here's the great thing Joe,

2775
01:29:46.171 --> 01:29:47.120
is that then Republicans,

2776
01:29:47.130 --> 01:29:47.881
it'll look at it and be like,

2777
01:29:47.881 --> 01:29:48.690
wait a minute,

2778
01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:52.680
this is a net transfer for rural areas for red states on the interior.

2779
01:29:52.681 --> 01:29:56.970
Am I really going to stand in the way that constituents getting this dividend?

2780
01:29:56.971 --> 01:29:59.160
And you can imagine me being like,

2781
01:29:59.161 --> 01:29:59.371
Hey,

2782
01:29:59.371 --> 01:30:00.760
what state wants to pilot this first?

2783
01:30:00.761 --> 01:30:01.021
If we can,

2784
01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:02.820
every state would be into it.

2785
01:30:02.821 --> 01:30:04.260
We can actually get this done.

2786
01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:05.880
This is a bipartisan thing.

2787
01:30:05.881 --> 01:30:07.410
It's not left or right.

2788
01:30:07.411 --> 01:30:08.244
It's forward.

2789
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:12.840
And keep in mind the state that has been demonstrated to love this dividend is

2790
01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:13.441
Alaska,

2791
01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:15.480
which is a deep red conservative state.

2792
01:30:15.930 --> 01:30:18.960
It was a Republican governor that passed the plan in the first place.

2793
01:30:18.961 --> 01:30:19.770
He said,

2794
01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:21.030
who'd you rather get the oil money?

2795
01:30:21.031 --> 01:30:24.390
That government was just going to screw it up or are you the people of Alaska?

2796
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:26.220
And then people will ask about like us please.

2797
01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:30.570
It wasn't that 10 cent device people to support the idea of drilling and some

2798
01:30:30.630 --> 01:30:31.710
controversial areas.

2799
01:30:31.711 --> 01:30:32.770
Though there,

2800
01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:33.660
there was probably,

2801
01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:33.991
you know,

2802
01:30:33.991 --> 01:30:35.850
a whole basket of motivations,

2803
01:30:35.851 --> 01:30:40.290
but now that thing has been in effect for 37 years as wildly popular.

2804
01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:42.300
So I'm what I'm suggesting when you say like,

2805
01:30:42.301 --> 01:30:42.481
Hey,

2806
01:30:42.481 --> 01:30:43.300
you become president,

2807
01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:44.190
you can't get anything done.

2808
01:30:44.191 --> 01:30:49.191
It's like I can get one big thing done because I think it's going to be really

2809
01:30:49.351 --> 01:30:52.100
popular among not just uh,

2810
01:30:52.210 --> 01:30:54.300
progressive's but also independents.

2811
01:30:54.301 --> 01:30:57.510
Libertarians like Milton Friedman who was the patron saint of Libertarian

2812
01:30:57.511 --> 01:31:01.920
economists loved this plan because what Libertarians and conservatives hate is

2813
01:31:01.921 --> 01:31:03.720
government making people's decisions.

2814
01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:06.330
What they like is economic freedom and autonomy.

2815
01:31:06.331 --> 01:31:09.930
I just spoke at a libertarian conference like Liberty Khan and was like,

2816
01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:15.380
guys like the freedom dividend would help people enjoy actual economic freedom

2817
01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:17.520
because you get 1000 bucks a month.

2818
01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:17.890
Like,

2819
01:31:17.890 --> 01:31:18.210
you know,

2820
01:31:18.210 --> 01:31:19.980
that makes you more free to do all sorts of things.

2821
01:31:19.981 --> 01:31:20.814
Like you can like,

2822
01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:21.480
you know,

2823
01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:22.380
you can,

2824
01:31:22.381 --> 01:31:23.100
uh,

2825
01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:24.390
like make better choices.

2826
01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:25.020
Um,

2827
01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:28.140
and as long as the government is completely like,

2828
01:31:28.141 --> 01:31:28.381
you know,

2829
01:31:28.381 --> 01:31:30.570
it's like what you do is your business.

2830
01:31:30.930 --> 01:31:31.680
So,

2831
01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:32.310
uh,

2832
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:34.440
this can actually become something we can get done.

2833
01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:36.480
The freedom dividends a great name too.

2834
01:31:36.481 --> 01:31:38.220
It's like the Patriot Act like,

2835
01:31:38.221 --> 01:31:38.431
yeah,

2836
01:31:38.431 --> 01:31:38.800
man,

2837
01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:39.420
excited,

2838
01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:40.020
freedom.

2839
01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:40.860
We're all about freedom.

2840
01:31:40.861 --> 01:31:43.410
Who can be against freedom isn't vote against that.

2841
01:31:43.650 --> 01:31:43.861
Yeah.

2842
01:31:43.861 --> 01:31:45.390
Who could be against the freedom dividend?

2843
01:31:45.391 --> 01:31:45.780
Come on.

2844
01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:46.440
What kind of,

2845
01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.010
uh,

2846
01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:47.400
you know,

2847
01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:48.233
asphalt do you have to beat?

2848
01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:52.500
This is gotta be taking up a tremendous amount of your time.

2849
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:53.423
Like what

2850
01:31:54.630 --> 01:31:55.171
are you doing?

2851
01:31:55.171 --> 01:31:57.120
Anything else in addition to doing this?

2852
01:31:57.121 --> 01:31:59.860
Are you setting aside everything else in your life other than your family

2853
01:31:59.861 --> 01:32:00.694
obligations?

2854
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:01.541
I have two jobs,

2855
01:32:01.541 --> 01:32:01.810
man.

2856
01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:02.643
One,

2857
01:32:03.010 --> 01:32:07.210
help accelerate society to try and deal with this historic transition wherein

2858
01:32:07.570 --> 01:32:08.590
and to stay married.

2859
01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:09.940
Those only things I'm about.

2860
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:11.013
Wow,

2861
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.530
that's a,

2862
01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:13.840
that's a powerful path.

2863
01:32:14.170 --> 01:32:14.770
Um,

2864
01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:15.281
now when,

2865
01:32:15.281 --> 01:32:18.250
when you're looking at the opposition and you look in all the other people that

2866
01:32:18.251 --> 01:32:20.920
are running for president and wonder whether or not they're going to be there by

2867
01:32:20.921 --> 01:32:22.390
the time the elections roll around,

2868
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:23.170
what,

2869
01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:24.550
what are you saying that's,

2870
01:32:24.551 --> 01:32:25.750
it's really interesting,

2871
01:32:25.751 --> 01:32:26.260
Joe.

2872
01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:27.250
Holy Cow.

2873
01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:30.520
That one of the funnest things about running for president is you run into all

2874
01:32:30.521 --> 01:32:33.400
the other candidates on the trail in Iowa,

2875
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:34.151
in New Hampshire.

2876
01:32:34.151 --> 01:32:37.510
So I'm like just hanging out backstage with like the gang,

2877
01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:37.840
right?

2878
01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.580
It's so interesting and fun.

2879
01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:41.890
It is weird sometimes,

2880
01:32:41.891 --> 01:32:45.010
but I really liked most of them and so sometimes people will ask me like,

2881
01:32:45.011 --> 01:32:45.161
Hey,

2882
01:32:45.161 --> 01:32:46.450
who do you want your running mate to be?

2883
01:32:46.450 --> 01:32:47.021
And I'm just like,

2884
01:32:47.021 --> 01:32:51.190
it really depends upon who I click with best because we're just going to be on

2885
01:32:51.191 --> 01:32:52.840
the trail all the time together.

2886
01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:54.580
So having met a bunch of them,

2887
01:32:54.581 --> 01:32:59.260
I got to say most of the candidates are really genuine patriots who just want to

2888
01:32:59.261 --> 01:33:00.590
try and do something positively.

2889
01:33:00.610 --> 01:33:02.230
See the country's heading in the wrong direction.

2890
01:33:02.231 --> 01:33:03.610
I could work with most all of them.

2891
01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:04.540
Uh,

2892
01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:04.781
Theresa,

2893
01:33:04.781 --> 01:33:06.250
who I think is going to be there in the end.

2894
01:33:06.251 --> 01:33:06.551
Man,

2895
01:33:06.551 --> 01:33:07.870
it's really interesting.

2896
01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:08.770
Uh,

2897
01:33:08.770 --> 01:33:08.951
I mean,

2898
01:33:08.951 --> 01:33:09.041
one,

2899
01:33:09.041 --> 01:33:10.810
one reason I like,

2900
01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:14.620
I will say that apparently the mainstream press had it out for Bernie last time

2901
01:33:14.621 --> 01:33:15.341
where they were just going to,

2902
01:33:15.341 --> 01:33:15.880
like,

2903
01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:17.650
I have a friend who worked in the media and they were like,

2904
01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:18.521
just like,

2905
01:33:18.521 --> 01:33:18.740
you know,

2906
01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:19.610
kneecap Bernie

2907
01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:22.213
kneecap brain.

2908
01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.420
Um,

2909
01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:24.030
know it's like,

2910
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:28.600
like there's definitely something going on where like certain corporate media

2911
01:33:28.601 --> 01:33:30.790
companies have certain candidates,

2912
01:33:30.791 --> 01:33:34.300
they kind of want to tip the scales for a little people that they want to like

2913
01:33:34.301 --> 01:33:35.050
tip it against.

2914
01:33:35.050 --> 01:33:35.171
Well,

2915
01:33:35.171 --> 01:33:37.510
they thought that Bernie was gonna get in the way of Hillary winning.

2916
01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:38.344
Is that the idea?

2917
01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:38.771
Yeah.

2918
01:33:38.771 --> 01:33:38.951
Yeah.

2919
01:33:38.951 --> 01:33:39.341
I mean they,

2920
01:33:39.341 --> 01:33:39.670
they,

2921
01:33:39.670 --> 01:33:41.970
they were in the Hillary camp for sure.

2922
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:42.190
Yeah.

2923
01:33:42.190 --> 01:33:43.510
And so that wasn't just the media,

2924
01:33:43.511 --> 01:33:44.830
that was also the DNC,

2925
01:33:44.831 --> 01:33:45.910
which is now on the record.

2926
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:48.700
So now happily,

2927
01:33:48.701 --> 01:33:52.240
certainly the DNC has turned a totally different leaf where the DNC is like,

2928
01:33:52.241 --> 01:33:56.500
we're not going to do anything that your with Eddie Woods prospects.

2929
01:33:56.620 --> 01:34:00.910
Well what they did was a disaster and disaster in terms of public image too.

2930
01:34:01.170 --> 01:34:01.430
Yeah.

2931
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.631
Yeah.

2932
01:34:01.631 --> 01:34:05.110
It was both substantively and like perception was the disaster for them.

2933
01:34:05.111 --> 01:34:06.430
So this time I got to say,

2934
01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:09.130
and that the team has turned over almost entirely,

2935
01:34:09.131 --> 01:34:10.570
like it's almost totally different people.

2936
01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:12.400
And then the media,

2937
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:14.830
we have the sense that you know,

2938
01:34:14.831 --> 01:34:15.281
they're,

2939
01:34:15.281 --> 01:34:19.090
they're still feeling out who they're going to try and put the thumb on the

2940
01:34:19.091 --> 01:34:21.800
scale for a Bernie.

2941
01:34:21.850 --> 01:34:22.900
Bernie is still running though,

2942
01:34:22.901 --> 01:34:23.420
right?

2943
01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:24.010
Um,

2944
01:34:24.010 --> 01:34:24.843
it looks like he's running it.

2945
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:26.470
You want to know something that's really stupid,

2946
01:34:26.471 --> 01:34:27.670
but it changed my opinion of him.

2947
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.480
He was being grilled by someone at the airport with a camera and he was

2948
01:34:31.481 --> 01:34:32.830
pretending to talk on the phone.

2949
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:34.540
But you could tell he wasn't really on the phone

2950
01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:37.390
and I saw that and I was like,

2951
01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:38.020
oh,

2952
01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:39.370
you can't do that.

2953
01:34:39.610 --> 01:34:40.271
You can't do that.

2954
01:34:40.271 --> 01:34:40.781
You could say,

2955
01:34:40.781 --> 01:34:42.940
I'm not giving impromptu interviews.

2956
01:34:42.941 --> 01:34:45.190
Thank you very much and keep walking.

2957
01:34:45.191 --> 01:34:46.450
Like if you want to interview me,

2958
01:34:46.810 --> 01:34:49.150
do it through the correct channels.

2959
01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:50.410
But he didn't do that.

2960
01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:51.970
He pretended to be on the phone.

2961
01:34:52.210 --> 01:34:55.360
It's a weird thing cause if you're willing to do that,

2962
01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:56.260
like that's just,

2963
01:34:56.650 --> 01:34:58.130
this is deceptive

2964
01:34:58.720 --> 01:34:59.091
<v 2>actually.</v>

2965
01:34:59.091 --> 01:35:00.830
If you can actually see the deception,

2966
01:35:00.831 --> 01:35:04.820
which I mean clearly you can see the video of the fucking phone is not on,

2967
01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:05.953
it's like he's,

2968
01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:07.910
it's like you could see his text messages

2969
01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:12.020
and he's like in the guy saying to him,

2970
01:35:12.021 --> 01:35:12.831
you're not on the phone.

2971
01:35:12.831 --> 01:35:13.970
I can tell you're not on the phone.

2972
01:35:13.971 --> 01:35:14.600
It's like,

2973
01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:15.550
and he keeps walking.

2974
01:35:15.570 --> 01:35:16.220
It's like,

2975
01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.980
I know that's a stupid thing to,

2976
01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:18.711
but it's like,

2977
01:35:18.711 --> 01:35:19.544
Huh,

2978
01:35:20.050 --> 01:35:20.560
<v 0>we are,</v>

2979
01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:20.800
you know,

2980
01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:23.840
we all sass out details about different people in different areas,

2981
01:35:23.841 --> 01:35:24.280
you know.

2982
01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:24.950
And like,

2983
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:25.180
you know,

2984
01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:25.570
it's like,

2985
01:35:25.570 --> 01:35:29.220
I think one reason I'm so grateful for this opportunity as,

2986
01:35:29.221 --> 01:35:29.501
as like,

2987
01:35:29.501 --> 01:35:29.980
you know,

2988
01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:33.670
like you actually can get a sense of different people in different environments

2989
01:35:33.671 --> 01:35:35.230
and it does end up impacting your,

2990
01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:36.041
your perception.

2991
01:35:36.041 --> 01:35:36.701
So I mean,

2992
01:35:36.701 --> 01:35:40.180
people made decisions on much lesser data points in that,

2993
01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:42.100
that way.

2994
01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:45.070
I'll remember what the fuck's his name from Vermont who uh,

2995
01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:45.730
Howard Dean,

2996
01:35:45.730 --> 01:35:46.720
the Dean scream man.

2997
01:35:47.410 --> 01:35:49.360
What he's from where he was from Vermont.

2998
01:35:49.630 --> 01:35:49.990
Vermont.

2999
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.620
Yeah.

3000
01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:51.670
That scream killed them.

3001
01:35:51.671 --> 01:35:52.340
Sank him.

3002
01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:53.860
Do you remember the Chappelle show parody?

3003
01:35:53.861 --> 01:35:54.420
The Chappelle show

3004
01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:55.770
<v 2>party of that was hysterical.</v>

3005
01:35:55.771 --> 01:35:56.604
It's for me,

3006
01:35:56.670 --> 01:35:59.570
but the fact that that it was just because it was a loud,

3007
01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:00.460
like a,

3008
01:36:00.810 --> 01:36:03.360
as a person who works in front of audiences a lot,

3009
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:05.730
when you're yelling into a microphone,

3010
01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:07.320
like the,

3011
01:36:07.321 --> 01:36:07.680
the,

3012
01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.210
you hear like,

3013
01:36:09.211 --> 01:36:11.580
especially if you don't have monitors in front of you,

3014
01:36:11.850 --> 01:36:14.190
what you hear is like everything.

3015
01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:15.780
You hear the crowd screaming,

3016
01:36:15.781 --> 01:36:16.614
you hear everything.

3017
01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:18.630
And if you're yelling into that microphone,

3018
01:36:18.631 --> 01:36:22.850
you're not realizing what it sounds like as a recording with him is like,

3019
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:25.710
and that was it.

3020
01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:26.880
One scream.

3021
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.110
I imagine,

3022
01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:33.350
imagine that one scream literally changed the course of that man's life.

3023
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:35.220
One,

3024
01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:38.130
most of them might have changed the course of the nation's history.

3025
01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.300
Might have crazy.

3026
01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.730
I don't know if that would happen today.

3027
01:36:41.731 --> 01:36:43.710
I think especially post Trump,

3028
01:36:43.711 --> 01:36:47.700
one thing that has happened is we're willing to forgive so much more,

3029
01:36:48.330 --> 01:36:49.163
you know?

3030
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.960
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

3031
01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:51.481
In some ways,

3032
01:36:51.481 --> 01:36:51.661
no,

3033
01:36:51.661 --> 01:36:51.961
man.

3034
01:36:51.961 --> 01:36:52.171
I mean,

3035
01:36:52.171 --> 01:36:52.980
I feel like,

3036
01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:53.341
you know,

3037
01:36:53.341 --> 01:36:53.821
like some,

3038
01:36:53.821 --> 01:36:54.654
some people,

3039
01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:55.673
uh,

3040
01:36:55.690 --> 01:36:56.010
uh,

3041
01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:57.870
more forgiving than are those for different things.

3042
01:36:57.871 --> 01:36:59.550
And for sure there's certainly,

3043
01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:00.330
yeah,

3044
01:37:00.330 --> 01:37:01.200
it varies.

3045
01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:04.380
But it would be interesting to imagine what a,

3046
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:06.540
what the dean scream would result in today.

3047
01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:09.790
Hopefully I'm not the person that tested out scream.

3048
01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:11.430
Please don't scream.

3049
01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:12.653
Um,

3050
01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:13.920
so what's next?

3051
01:37:13.921 --> 01:37:14.671
Now you,

3052
01:37:14.671 --> 01:37:15.030
you,

3053
01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:16.860
you're trying to elevate your profile.

3054
01:37:16.861 --> 01:37:19.650
You're trying to make people aware of your platform and what you're,

3055
01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.513
how you're running.

3056
01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:21.480
What does next,

3057
01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:22.201
it's good fun,

3058
01:37:22.201 --> 01:37:22.411
man.

3059
01:37:22.411 --> 01:37:24.420
I'm enjoying running for president more than I thought I would.

3060
01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:25.890
That's a great thing to hear.

3061
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.520
Yeah.

3062
01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:30.990
Like it's so one thing is that when you talk to Americans and you know like

3063
01:37:31.050 --> 01:37:34.110
rural Iowa or Manchester New Hampshire,

3064
01:37:34.111 --> 01:37:36.150
it's like the really good people like you know,

3065
01:37:36.151 --> 01:37:38.550
it's like the stuff that you might imagine,

3066
01:37:38.551 --> 01:37:38.791
it's like,

3067
01:37:38.791 --> 01:37:38.971
oh,

3068
01:37:38.971 --> 01:37:39.510
people know.

3069
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:40.650
It's like really good,

3070
01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:41.581
honest,

3071
01:37:41.581 --> 01:37:44.190
genuine people just trying to make their lives better.

3072
01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:45.001
People.

3073
01:37:45.001 --> 01:37:46.620
I really love hanging out with our union guys,

3074
01:37:46.621 --> 01:37:48.390
like handed the truckers was fun hanging out with,

3075
01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:51.830
I hung out with these union metalworkers the other day in New Hampshire.

3076
01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:52.081
I was like,

3077
01:37:52.081 --> 01:37:52.291
Hey,

3078
01:37:52.291 --> 01:37:53.100
I need like,

3079
01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:53.371
you know,

3080
01:37:53.371 --> 01:37:54.270
robots going on,

3081
01:37:54.890 --> 01:37:55.770
you're in your fields.

3082
01:37:55.771 --> 01:37:56.970
And then one of them was like,

3083
01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:57.181
yeah,

3084
01:37:57.181 --> 01:37:57.871
I actually like,

3085
01:37:57.871 --> 01:38:01.680
we used to take five to eight guys to bend this rebar to reinforce a bridge.

3086
01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:02.940
Now they bring in a robot,

3087
01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:05.070
does it overnight and then they're like,

3088
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.941
and they're like,

3089
01:38:05.941 --> 01:38:06.091
hey,

3090
01:38:06.091 --> 01:38:06.930
good for you guys.

3091
01:38:06.931 --> 01:38:07.860
You don't have to do this.

3092
01:38:07.861 --> 01:38:08.520
And then we're like,

3093
01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:10.710
we just lost a free country day's pay.

3094
01:38:10.711 --> 01:38:11.131
They were like,

3095
01:38:11.131 --> 01:38:12.500
why are we supposed to be happy about this?

3096
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:14.550
So then when I go in,

3097
01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.590
I talked to them about what's going on in the economy.

3098
01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:16.981
They're like,

3099
01:38:16.981 --> 01:38:17.611
oh man.

3100
01:38:17.611 --> 01:38:17.791
Yeah.

3101
01:38:17.791 --> 01:38:18.271
Like yeah,

3102
01:38:18.271 --> 01:38:19.470
that's like a real problem.

3103
01:38:19.471 --> 01:38:21.120
And unions have been losing for years.

3104
01:38:21.121 --> 01:38:22.590
Like they don't know it like the,

3105
01:38:22.591 --> 01:38:22.890
you know,

3106
01:38:22.890 --> 01:38:24.090
membership's gone and half.

3107
01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:25.380
Uh,

3108
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:30.380
so just a on the campaign trail making the case to two different people.

3109
01:38:31.291 --> 01:38:34.620
I was on the daily show last week and that's going to fill in pretty soon.

3110
01:38:35.190 --> 01:38:39.360
The next big benchmark for the campaign is the Democratic primary debates in

3111
01:38:39.361 --> 01:38:41.700
June where they're going to bring all the candidates up.

3112
01:38:41.701 --> 01:38:45.150
And this is something the DNC halfly seems like they're being really,

3113
01:38:45.151 --> 01:38:47.480
really open about it.

3114
01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:48.181
It's not like,

3115
01:38:48.181 --> 01:38:48.391
hey,

3116
01:38:48.391 --> 01:38:49.021
you need to,

3117
01:38:49.021 --> 01:38:49.570
you know,

3118
01:38:49.570 --> 01:38:49.871
like,

3119
01:38:49.871 --> 01:38:50.190
uh,

3120
01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:51.450
like have particular things.

3121
01:38:51.451 --> 01:38:52.284
So I'm,

3122
01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:56.640
I'm very confident that we'll be on that debate stage and then we can just keep

3123
01:38:56.641 --> 01:38:58.980
on making the case to the American people.

3124
01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:00.180
When you're going to do something like that.

3125
01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:01.013
How do you prepare?

3126
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:05.190
Do you do have someone throw fake questions at you and you practice them and

3127
01:39:05.191 --> 01:39:06.270
practice the answers?

3128
01:39:06.271 --> 01:39:07.200
Do you work with a coach?

3129
01:39:07.201 --> 01:39:07.321
Like,

3130
01:39:07.321 --> 01:39:07.860
how does that,

3131
01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:09.390
how are you going to do that for that?

3132
01:39:09.391 --> 01:39:10.650
Given the enormity of the occasion.

3133
01:39:10.651 --> 01:39:12.480
I'm sure we will have something like that,

3134
01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:15.630
but I want to double back on a conversation you had recently with a guy named

3135
01:39:15.631 --> 01:39:17.640
Lawrence Lessig about campaign finance reform.

3136
01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:22.830
And like there are all these interrelated problems in our society.

3137
01:39:22.831 --> 01:39:23.641
And in my opinion,

3138
01:39:23.641 --> 01:39:26.490
the automation wave is like driving a lot of them because it's making people

3139
01:39:26.491 --> 01:39:27.440
less functional,

3140
01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:30.660
making people less able to focus on the big problems in the future.

3141
01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:31.980
Um,

3142
01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:36.360
and then part of it is that our political system is held captive by a rich

3143
01:39:36.361 --> 01:39:39.420
corporations and Billy and like mega wealthy individuals.

3144
01:39:39.421 --> 01:39:41.820
And like the average voter feels like my vote doesn't matter.

3145
01:39:42.330 --> 01:39:42.661
Uh,

3146
01:39:42.661 --> 01:39:43.380
and so,

3147
01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:43.561
uh,

3148
01:39:43.561 --> 01:39:43.801
you know,

3149
01:39:43.801 --> 01:39:45.180
I was talking to Lawrence Lessig is like,

3150
01:39:45.181 --> 01:39:45.301
hey,

3151
01:39:45.301 --> 01:39:45.901
how do we fix it?

3152
01:39:45.901 --> 01:39:47.250
And I heard your conversation with them.

3153
01:39:47.670 --> 01:39:49.110
And so a solution would be,

3154
01:39:49.111 --> 01:39:54.111
we give every American adult $100 democracy dollars that can only be contributed

3155
01:39:55.171 --> 01:39:56.640
to a political campaign.

3156
01:39:57.090 --> 01:40:00.960
And then you end up counterbalancing and washing out a lot of the corporate

3157
01:40:00.961 --> 01:40:04.230
money because all of a sudden if I get 10,000 people on board with me,

3158
01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.540
that's like a freaking million bucks.

3159
01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:06.691
Now.

3160
01:40:06.691 --> 01:40:07.560
That's very interesting.

3161
01:40:07.561 --> 01:40:08.700
That's an interesting idea.

3162
01:40:08.701 --> 01:40:10.430
I liked that a lot because the,

3163
01:40:10.431 --> 01:40:10.560
the,

3164
01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:13.890
the problem Joe was that a lot of our regulatory approaches right now or like

3165
01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:14.850
the negative approach,

3166
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.230
it's like don't do this,

3167
01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:17.093
don't do that.

3168
01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.490
And the fact is a lot of the time it's really hard to like actually like a

3169
01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:23.250
regulate away a lot of this stuff.

3170
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.720
And so Lawrence was like,

3171
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:25.583
you know what,

3172
01:40:25.650 --> 01:40:27.450
let's just put money into people's hands.

3173
01:40:27.451 --> 01:40:30.360
I can only go into the political system and then it makes it,

3174
01:40:30.361 --> 01:40:33.720
so if someone like me appeals to humans,

3175
01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:37.980
then I get money as opposed to making it so that the people in the money or like

3176
01:40:37.981 --> 01:40:40.170
two different sides of the equation.

3177
01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:40.961
And I,

3178
01:40:40.961 --> 01:40:42.460
I got to say we were talking a,

3179
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:46.440
as a team about being here and like you have like the biggest audience of just

3180
01:40:46.441 --> 01:40:49.380
about any media platform in the country right now.

3181
01:40:49.381 --> 01:40:50.510
Like bigger than cable news,

3182
01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:51.390
bigger than anything.

3183
01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:52.831
Oh fuck.

3184
01:40:52.831 --> 01:40:53.664
Did that happen?

3185
01:40:53.770 --> 01:40:54.050
Uh,

3186
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:54.461
you know,

3187
01:40:54.461 --> 01:40:54.870
I mean,

3188
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:55.703
uh,

3189
01:40:56.130 --> 01:40:57.130
to me you're like a,

3190
01:40:57.190 --> 01:41:00.070
you're the primary voice of reason right now in our society,

3191
01:41:00.071 --> 01:41:00.904
man.

3192
01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.340
No one step up and take that please.

3193
01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:06.600
I think it's used for the time being brother books.

3194
01:41:06.710 --> 01:41:08.540
But what I was saying was that like,

3195
01:41:08.541 --> 01:41:08.890
if,

3196
01:41:08.890 --> 01:41:13.870
if people that listen to this conversation donate 10 20 bucks to my campaign,

3197
01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:15.610
they're like 10 million people are gonna listen to this.

3198
01:41:15.611 --> 01:41:17.530
That's like 100 to $200 million.

3199
01:41:17.531 --> 01:41:19.980
And that's enough for me to go in and break the,

3200
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.311
the,

3201
01:41:20.311 --> 01:41:21.280
the moneyed system.

3202
01:41:21.370 --> 01:41:23.200
I can go in there and just say,

3203
01:41:23.201 --> 01:41:23.740
all right,

3204
01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:24.970
let's get money out of politics.

3205
01:41:24.971 --> 01:41:27.190
And the way we're going to do it is we're going to actually just give people

3206
01:41:27.191 --> 01:41:30.250
money to be able to restore democracy in a real way.

3207
01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.260
Do you have a patrion page or anything like that?

3208
01:41:32.450 --> 01:41:33.100
Um,

3209
01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:35.380
my website's Yang 20 twenty.com.

3210
01:41:35.670 --> 01:41:35.910
Uh,

3211
01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:38.500
and so our average donation is only $19.

3212
01:41:38.501 --> 01:41:40.600
So we joke that my fans are even cheaper than Bernie's.

3213
01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:45.340
The thing with people is you gotta make it easy,

3214
01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:46.301
make it easy,

3215
01:41:46.301 --> 01:41:48.160
like having an Amazon one click button.

3216
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:48.671
Oh,

3217
01:41:48.671 --> 01:41:50.360
we were taking Venmo for awhile,

3218
01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:50.691
so,

3219
01:41:50.691 --> 01:41:51.110
you know,

3220
01:41:51.110 --> 01:41:51.911
we were like working on it.

3221
01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:54.550
It was a bit of a pain in the neck administratively.

3222
01:41:55.150 --> 01:41:56.290
Also want to say one other thing.

3223
01:41:56.291 --> 01:41:58.360
I did that I think we'll entertain the heck out of you.

3224
01:41:59.040 --> 01:41:59.500
Um,

3225
01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:02.410
I'm giving 1000 bucks a month to a family in New Hampshire,

3226
01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:02.891
uh,

3227
01:42:02.891 --> 01:42:03.820
Anna family of Iowa,

3228
01:42:03.821 --> 01:42:04.750
just out of my own pocket.

3229
01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:05.501
Just to illustrate,

3230
01:42:05.501 --> 01:42:05.740
you know,

3231
01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:08.890
what $1,000 a month I'll actually like do you and your household?

3232
01:42:08.891 --> 01:42:09.724
Good.

3233
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:11.710
And I got clearance with these people.

3234
01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:15.070
We had a bunch of submissions a on online for New Hampshire and Iowa.

3235
01:42:15.071 --> 01:42:16.240
We're still taking some mission.

3236
01:42:16.241 --> 01:42:17.920
So if you know people in Iowa,

3237
01:42:18.250 --> 01:42:19.780
they could use 1000 bucks a month,

3238
01:42:19.810 --> 01:42:20.471
just go to Yang,

3239
01:42:20.471 --> 01:42:20.681
20,

3240
01:42:20.681 --> 01:42:21.041
29,

3241
01:42:21.041 --> 01:42:22.990
come nominate them and then we'll,

3242
01:42:22.991 --> 01:42:25.540
we'll pick someone and there's no obligation.

3243
01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:27.100
So it's out of my own pocket.

3244
01:42:27.570 --> 01:42:27.911
Uh,

3245
01:42:27.911 --> 01:42:29.620
and there's no obligation.

3246
01:42:29.621 --> 01:42:30.610
So the FTC was like,

3247
01:42:30.611 --> 01:42:30.911
well,

3248
01:42:30.911 --> 01:42:31.121
you know,

3249
01:42:31.121 --> 01:42:31.691
no problem.

3250
01:42:31.691 --> 01:42:34.420
It's just a like an act of philanthropy or like,

3251
01:42:34.421 --> 01:42:34.661
you know,

3252
01:42:34.661 --> 01:42:35.494
a gift.

3253
01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:41.160
And then a family in south Georgia was so touched by my campaign that they're

3254
01:42:41.561 --> 01:42:45.220
now is applying 1000 bucks a month to a family in South Carolina,

3255
01:42:45.670 --> 01:42:46.330
uh,

3256
01:42:46.330 --> 01:42:50.320
in honor of Martin Luther King who was for a basic income.

3257
01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:53.530
So we're really inverting this mindset of scarcity and take,

3258
01:42:53.531 --> 01:42:53.741
take,

3259
01:42:53.741 --> 01:42:54.521
take and being like,

3260
01:42:54.521 --> 01:42:54.930
look,

3261
01:42:54.930 --> 01:42:56.260
this is like plenty to go around.

3262
01:42:56.261 --> 01:42:59.740
We like the richest and most advanced society in the history of the world and

3263
01:42:59.741 --> 01:42:59.980
uh,

3264
01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:04.000
we can make lives better just by coming together as a people.

3265
01:43:04.001 --> 01:43:08.230
There's nothing stopping the majority of citizens in a democracy from voting

3266
01:43:08.231 --> 01:43:09.070
ourselves a dividend.

3267
01:43:09.970 --> 01:43:10.930
I love the idea,

3268
01:43:10.931 --> 01:43:11.440
man.

3269
01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:12.273
I really do.

3270
01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:17.280
And I love the idea of trying to find solutions to this obvious issue that's

3271
01:43:18.190 --> 01:43:18.970
impending.

3272
01:43:18.970 --> 01:43:20.830
And then I just seems like we're not going to escape.

3273
01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:22.660
I mean it seems like automation is coming.

3274
01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:24.490
There's no way to get around it.

3275
01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:25.353
No Way.

3276
01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:27.280
There's no way around it for sure.

3277
01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.770
I mean it's here with us already.

3278
01:43:30.130 --> 01:43:31.210
It's inevitable.

3279
01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:34.510
And the danger we're in right now is that if we don't respond to it,

3280
01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:35.950
then there's going to be a lot of,

3281
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:37.263
uh,

3282
01:43:37.670 --> 01:43:41.500
a lot of anger about the changes that are coming our way.

3283
01:43:41.530 --> 01:43:45.580
And so a bunch of techies are actually supporting my campaign because a lot of

3284
01:43:45.581 --> 01:43:47.050
techies are not jerks.

3285
01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:47.591
They're just like,

3286
01:43:47.591 --> 01:43:48.401
I'm doing my job.

3287
01:43:48.401 --> 01:43:48.941
I'm just like,

3288
01:43:48.941 --> 01:43:49.091
you know,

3289
01:43:49.091 --> 01:43:50.020
my job actually just,

3290
01:43:50.021 --> 01:43:52.400
it tends to result and other people losing their jobs.

3291
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:53.360
Right.

3292
01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:55.370
And so what I say to them and they agree,

3293
01:43:55.371 --> 01:43:58.100
it's like this is enlightened self interest for us all.

3294
01:43:58.490 --> 01:44:01.220
It's like progress should be something we're excited about.

3295
01:44:01.610 --> 01:44:04.610
There is a world where we're celebrating the fact that the truckers are getting

3296
01:44:04.611 --> 01:44:09.260
liberated from their trucks because that's a really difficult punishing job,

3297
01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:11.570
especially on their backs.

3298
01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:12.493
Yes.

3299
01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:13.231
And so the,

3300
01:44:13.231 --> 01:44:18.140
the goal is to try and make it so that people are actually able to be happy

3301
01:44:18.141 --> 01:44:20.000
about the inevitable.

3302
01:44:20.490 --> 01:44:20.630
Uh,

3303
01:44:20.630 --> 01:44:20.891
you know,

3304
01:44:20.891 --> 01:44:21.080
it's,

3305
01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:22.130
it was a quote in my book,

3306
01:44:22.131 --> 01:44:23.090
Bismarck was like,

3307
01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:25.340
if we're going to go through a revolution,

3308
01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:28.280
you'd rather undertake it than undergo it.

3309
01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:29.271
You know,

3310
01:44:29.271 --> 01:44:29.660
it's like,

3311
01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:31.010
like if the revolution is coming,

3312
01:44:31.011 --> 01:44:35.540
then we need to get in front of it and start making it work for us instead of

3313
01:44:35.541 --> 01:44:37.430
just waiting for it to tear us apart.

3314
01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:38.390
Well,

3315
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:40.190
I love the idea and uh,

3316
01:44:40.230 --> 01:44:41.540
it'd be amazing if you won.

3317
01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:42.080
I mean,

3318
01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:43.280
really it would be fascinating.

3319
01:44:43.281 --> 01:44:43.940
And like I said,

3320
01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:44.090
I've,

3321
01:44:44.090 --> 01:44:47.120
I've done a complete one 80 on the idea of universal basic income,

3322
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:51.290
particularly once I started talking to Elon about it when he was saying that

3323
01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:54.020
it's inevitable that you're going to need something like that,

3324
01:44:54.410 --> 01:44:56.690
that it's coming close on this man.

3325
01:44:56.690 --> 01:44:57.523
It's like,

3326
01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:57.951
okay,

3327
01:44:57.951 --> 01:44:59.600
so if you accept what Ilan said,

3328
01:44:59.601 --> 01:45:00.261
that it's inevitable,

3329
01:45:00.261 --> 01:45:01.340
which I 100% agree with.

3330
01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:03.650
Let's say you go too early.

3331
01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:05.360
What is the downside?

3332
01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:05.841
Well,

3333
01:45:05.841 --> 01:45:06.201
let's see.

3334
01:45:06.201 --> 01:45:08.120
You alleviate untold,

3335
01:45:08.690 --> 01:45:13.130
pointless human misery and you have more time to build the institutions and help

3336
01:45:13.131 --> 01:45:13.964
us adapt.

3337
01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:15.920
That's the downside of you go too early.

3338
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:17.181
What's the downside?

3339
01:45:17.181 --> 01:45:18.050
If you go too late?

3340
01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:23.360
The downside if you go too late is literal disintegration and catastrophe

3341
01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:27.950
because it's not like society will magically reorder itself if you're like,

3342
01:45:27.951 --> 01:45:28.641
okay guys,

3343
01:45:28.641 --> 01:45:29.600
we're a little bit late to this,

3344
01:45:29.601 --> 01:45:30.620
but like now we're going to start,

3345
01:45:30.650 --> 01:45:35.000
you know like putting checks into people's hands like so the incentive to go

3346
01:45:35.001 --> 01:45:38.420
early are pretty much all the incentives.

3347
01:45:38.421 --> 01:45:41.960
It's like going to late is literally society ending.

3348
01:45:42.230 --> 01:45:44.780
So if you accept what Ilan says,

3349
01:45:44.781 --> 01:45:45.860
which I agree with that look,

3350
01:45:45.861 --> 01:45:46.700
this is inevitable,

3351
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:52.090
then there's no point in trying to like time it right now.

3352
01:45:53.090 --> 01:45:57.380
Put particularly if you accept the fact that all of the signs you would expect

3353
01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:01.730
if we were displacing labor already there men leaving the workforce like drug

3354
01:46:01.731 --> 01:46:02.540
overdoses,

3355
01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:03.380
video games,

3356
01:46:03.381 --> 01:46:06.080
like all like it's all right there in front of us.

3357
01:46:06.081 --> 01:46:08.780
If you just like take the rock and like flip it over.

3358
01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:10.770
And the thing I'm going to say I,

3359
01:46:10.771 --> 01:46:11.151
you know,

3360
01:46:11.151 --> 01:46:12.680
a friend of mine Andy Stern said,

3361
01:46:12.681 --> 01:46:16.700
is that our government is terrible at most things but it is excellent at sending

3362
01:46:16.701 --> 01:46:21.140
large numbers of checks to large numbers of people properly and reliably.

3363
01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:25.910
We have to lean into one of the only core competencies our government has that

3364
01:46:25.911 --> 01:46:29.090
we can trust and then it will let us make our own decisions.

3365
01:46:29.370 --> 01:46:34.370
Like this is very much about human empowerment and the alternative is too

3366
01:46:34.971 --> 01:46:36.440
terrible to contemplate.

3367
01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:41.860
Last question because I guess no discussion of presidential policy and the,

3368
01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:45.220
the possibility of someone like you running this countries.

3369
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:50.370
How do you feel about international relations and

3370
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:55.290
<v 2>the obvious issues of dealing with other countries and what's going on with</v>

3371
01:46:55.291 --> 01:46:59.100
China and Russia and the interference of our democracy and all the different

3372
01:46:59.101 --> 01:47:02.790
various issues that we've experienced over the last,

3373
01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:05.220
particularly over the last couple of years with Russia.

3374
01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:05.761
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

3375
01:47:05.761 --> 01:47:06.061
sure.

3376
01:47:06.061 --> 01:47:08.940
So about Russia and you and I were talking about this before we went on air.

3377
01:47:09.930 --> 01:47:10.860
When I'm president,

3378
01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:11.611
I will say,

3379
01:47:11.611 --> 01:47:12.444
look,

3380
01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:13.553
Russia,

3381
01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:14.753
I get it.

3382
01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.270
We have tampered with other people's elections for years and decades.

3383
01:47:18.530 --> 01:47:19.830
Like we in America have done that.

3384
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:23.280
You've done it to us for the last number of years.

3385
01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:25.380
It is going to stop right now.

3386
01:47:25.770 --> 01:47:29.970
And if we have any credible evidence that you are tampering with our information

3387
01:47:29.971 --> 01:47:30.721
and our democracy,

3388
01:47:30.721 --> 01:47:34.950
we will take that as an act of hostility and aggression and we will retaliate in

3389
01:47:34.951 --> 01:47:36.210
some way that will make your life very,

3390
01:47:36.211 --> 01:47:37.500
very painful and inconvenient.

3391
01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:40.500
And the people of United States will support me on this.

3392
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:42.720
And so here is your drop dead date,

3393
01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:44.400
like turn off the bots.

3394
01:47:44.730 --> 01:47:47.910
And if we find that your bots are still going after this date,

3395
01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:49.230
I will just bring the evidence,

3396
01:47:49.231 --> 01:47:51.240
the American people and then we will act.

3397
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:52.860
And you will not like it one bit.

3398
01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:53.910
Now if,

3399
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:57.830
if I mean I'm thinking 80 90% of Americans would get behind that,

3400
01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:58.351
it'd be like,

3401
01:47:58.351 --> 01:48:00.210
how are we just like looking at it being like,

3402
01:48:00.211 --> 01:48:01.050
what are we going to do?

3403
01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:02.160
What are we going to do?

3404
01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:03.031
And in this one,

3405
01:48:03.031 --> 01:48:06.690
I actually feel a little bit for the tech companies because it's very difficult

3406
01:48:06.691 --> 01:48:08.160
for the tech companies to,

3407
01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:09.180
uh,

3408
01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:09.630
to prevent

3409
01:48:09.630 --> 01:48:09.960
<v 2>this.</v>

3410
01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:10.890
Almost impossible,

3411
01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:11.661
almost impossible,

3412
01:48:11.661 --> 01:48:13.410
almost impossible to identify.

3413
01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:16.020
And if you go back to Sam Harris podcast,

3414
01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:17.010
so we were discussing,

3415
01:48:17.011 --> 01:48:20.070
which is called the war of information that I think that's what's called

3416
01:48:20.071 --> 01:48:23.520
information war or war of information for a recent podcast in the last couple of

3417
01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:23.810
weeks.

3418
01:48:23.810 --> 01:48:24.420
Um,

3419
01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:29.420
they detail how there's essentially just giant groups of people that work for

3420
01:48:30.151 --> 01:48:35.040
the Russian government that pretend to be people that are involved in black

3421
01:48:35.041 --> 01:48:38.790
lives matter or pretend to be people that are involved in Texas culture,

3422
01:48:38.791 --> 01:48:39.780
southern culture.

3423
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:44.990
And they're just sowing seeds of argument and descent and they are laughing

3424
01:48:45.631 --> 01:48:48.450
their asses all laughing and making funny memes.

3425
01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:50.820
Like some of their memes are really hilarious,

3426
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.320
but,

3427
01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:54.210
but to them this is the greatest Roi they've ever seen.

3428
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:56.640
They didn't even like return on investment.

3429
01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:57.513
Okay.

3430
01:48:58.890 --> 01:48:59.723
Entrepreneur,

3431
01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:00.870
Youtube,

3432
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:01.703
man,

3433
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:03.240
I don't have a man hangar.

3434
01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:05.460
I haven't normal freaking house.

3435
01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:07.073
So,

3436
01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:08.230
<v 0>uh,</v>

3437
01:49:08.230 --> 01:49:10.620
like they invested not even that much money like,

3438
01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:13.450
but they've found like this underbelly they can just speak in,

3439
01:49:13.451 --> 01:49:15.800
slice into and so they,

3440
01:49:15.810 --> 01:49:17.600
they've spent best essence,

3441
01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:21.670
like low tens of millions of dollars and it's caused us how much damage,

3442
01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:23.980
how much harm a real impact in town.

3443
01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:24.790
Like you know,

3444
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:29.140
I mean you couldn't even put a dollar figure on it so you have to just say like

3445
01:49:29.141 --> 01:49:29.470
look,

3446
01:49:29.470 --> 01:49:32.410
I get the tech companies are going to try but they're not going to be able to

3447
01:49:32.411 --> 01:49:32.861
pull it off.

3448
01:49:32.861 --> 01:49:36.850
So just like go on and just say to like the world and say hey this is to Russia.

3449
01:49:36.851 --> 01:49:37.780
But anyone else,

3450
01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:38.471
same thing.

3451
01:49:38.471 --> 01:49:40.810
Like if you tamper with our democracy,

3452
01:49:40.811 --> 01:49:44.140
we are going to come down on you like a ton of bricks and if we're not quite

3453
01:49:44.141 --> 01:49:46.060
sure we're still going to come down on you.

3454
01:49:46.061 --> 01:49:46.840
Like a ton of bricks.

3455
01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:48.940
Like don't need like 100% certainty on this.

3456
01:49:48.941 --> 01:49:49.774
I need like,

3457
01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:50.291
you know,

3458
01:49:50.291 --> 01:49:51.280
like a legal standard.

3459
01:49:51.281 --> 01:49:56.281
I need like 80 85% and the American people would be like about time because you

3460
01:49:57.101 --> 01:49:57.341
know the,

3461
01:49:57.341 --> 01:50:00.850
if we can't trust ourselves or each other or what we're seeing,

3462
01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:03.490
and this is before deep fakes and the rest of it starts hitting.

3463
01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:06.700
Like if you're actually going to believe in democracy,

3464
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:10.420
then you have to start protecting our information as fast as possible.

3465
01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:12.640
And you also in my mind have to start,

3466
01:50:12.970 --> 01:50:14.050
and this is a local issue,

3467
01:50:14.051 --> 01:50:16.450
but I'm in New Hampshire and Iowa talking about this stuff,

3468
01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:18.340
their local newspapers are all dying.

3469
01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:22.360
It's like thousands of local papers is winking out of existence because they

3470
01:50:22.361 --> 01:50:23.770
used to rely on classified ads.

3471
01:50:23.771 --> 01:50:25.180
There are no classified ads anymore.

3472
01:50:25.181 --> 01:50:26.110
It's all Craig's list.

3473
01:50:26.111 --> 01:50:27.040
And so they all die.

3474
01:50:27.670 --> 01:50:29.560
And if you believe in democracy,

3475
01:50:29.561 --> 01:50:32.840
how the heck can anyone vote on anything if they have no idea what's going on

3476
01:50:32.841 --> 01:50:33.660
right there.

3477
01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:34.110
So,

3478
01:50:34.110 --> 01:50:35.890
so there are a lot of interrelated issues.

3479
01:50:35.891 --> 01:50:36.031
I mean,

3480
01:50:36.031 --> 01:50:36.821
one thing I'm saying is like,

3481
01:50:36.821 --> 01:50:37.360
look,

3482
01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:41.440
we had a happy time where local newspapers were supported by classified ads.

3483
01:50:41.441 --> 01:50:42.274
It's over now,

3484
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:43.870
but we're still a democracy.

3485
01:50:43.871 --> 01:50:45.670
You still need some information to vote.

3486
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:50.080
So we need to try and find new ways for you to get quality information like

3487
01:50:50.081 --> 01:50:50.301
that.

3488
01:50:50.301 --> 01:50:51.460
Those thrown our hands up and being,

3489
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:52.600
I guess the Russians are going to,

3490
01:50:52.601 --> 01:50:52.931
you know,

3491
01:50:52.931 --> 01:50:56.710
like in like just misinform us with bots and I guess all the local newspapers

3492
01:50:56.711 --> 01:50:57.544
are going to die.

3493
01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:58.151
Like you said,

3494
01:50:58.151 --> 01:51:01.450
like these are problems and we have to start solving them.

3495
01:51:01.810 --> 01:51:06.250
If you still believe that democracy is the best form of government and that's

3496
01:51:06.251 --> 01:51:07.130
what we're going to carry forward with,

3497
01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.380
would you obviously have to believe,

3498
01:51:08.381 --> 01:51:11.290
like you have to go with that as your model.

3499
01:51:11.530 --> 01:51:13.590
And so it's all interrelated,

3500
01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.430
but we have to start thinking much,

3501
01:51:15.431 --> 01:51:18.280
much bigger about what we can get done because things are slipping away.

3502
01:51:18.281 --> 01:51:19.750
Things are trending in a terrible,

3503
01:51:19.751 --> 01:51:20.584
terrible direction.

3504
01:51:21.190 --> 01:51:21.371
Well,

3505
01:51:21.371 --> 01:51:22.204
Andrew,

3506
01:51:22.270 --> 01:51:23.140
good luck to you.

3507
01:51:23.170 --> 01:51:24.100
You're a good man.

3508
01:51:24.130 --> 01:51:25.150
I wish you well.

3509
01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:26.470
Thank you for being here.

3510
01:51:26.471 --> 01:51:29.950
I think your message is excellent and I hope you really make an impact.

3511
01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:30.810
Thank you Joseph.

3512
01:51:30.810 --> 01:51:31.530
Really appreciate it,

3513
01:51:31.530 --> 01:51:31.810
man.

3514
01:51:31.810 --> 01:51:33.130
President Yang Man,

3515
01:51:33.131 --> 01:51:33.431
if I,

3516
01:51:33.431 --> 01:51:34.270
if I win,

3517
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:35.081
if I win,

3518
01:51:35.081 --> 01:51:36.310
you can do a special,

3519
01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:37.010
uh,

3520
01:51:37.010 --> 01:51:39.160
Ari from the White House and that would be a blast.

3521
01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:40.033
Let's do it.

3522
01:51:40.050 --> 01:51:40.720
Thanks sir.

3523
01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:41.231
Appreciate it,

3524
01:51:41.231 --> 01:51:41.470
man.
