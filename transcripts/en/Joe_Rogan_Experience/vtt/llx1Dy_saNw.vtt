00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>freak bitches.</v>

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.561
<v Speaker 1>Can You keep it real?</v>

4
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Can You keep it?</v>

5
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.380
<v Speaker 1>100.</v>

6
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.213
<v Speaker 1>Look at that lady.</v>

7
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.050
<v Speaker 1>What is she doing?</v>

8
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Is She doing the Dab?</v>

9
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Dab It on him.</v>

10
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.661
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>

11
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>She's dabbled.</v>

12
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>She just doing Tai Chi in the park.</v>

13
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Deafness says it on her shirt on a shirt that she doesn't know she's wearing.</v>

14
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.680
<v Speaker 1>She didn't realize that she can't read the blind.</v>

15
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

16
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 50,000 years old lawyers keep pounding.</v>

17
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Have we think it's so funny when old people talk as if they were ever young and</v>

18
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>fucking like as if they've never had sex.</v>

19
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Like that lady probably at one point in time was a Dick connoisseur.</v>

20
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>He's out there in the park not knowing what the fuck she's wearing.</v>

21
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 1>The addict connoisseur in the park.</v>

22
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the best place probably to be sampling Dick.</v>

23
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Probably hard to get a good one though when you're at that age is probably real</v>

24
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>tough because it's all about enthusiasm.</v>

25
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Like dudes are pretty down with old ladies.</v>

26
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Like old dudes.</v>

27
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.951
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

28
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:53.431
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

29
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Well that's an issue.</v>

30
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm a friend of mine.</v>

31
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.371
<v Speaker 1>Go on.</v>

32
00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:01.371
<v Speaker 1>One of his buddies worked at a old folks home and said that one of the big</v>

33
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 1>issues was these old guys would get Viagra and these old ladies,</v>

34
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>they didn't give a fuck and a lot of them are on antidepressants,</v>

35
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>so they're like la La la who gives a shit like they're on Xanax and getting stds</v>

36
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

37
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was that.</v>

38
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.690
<v Speaker 1>That's something that I heard about,</v>

39
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>like it's rampant because that's happening.</v>

40
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

41
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>that's probably really bad when you're old,</v>

42
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:23.724
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Like your body doesn't heal so good.</v>

44
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>No list when you're fucking 98.</v>

45
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

46
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 1>herpes is like an attack on your immune system.</v>

47
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 1>There it goes.</v>

48
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>The new erotic frontier,</v>

49
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>sex in nursing homes.</v>

50
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Until recently,</v>

51
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>nursing homes frowned on sex.</v>

52
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Now increasingly they smile.</v>

53
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

54
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>it didn't make sense.</v>

55
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

56
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Why shouldn't we have fun?</v>

57
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

58
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.730
<v Speaker 1>When Aubrey Davidson age 85 minutes,</v>

59
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>special guy at the Hebrew home in Riverdale in the Bronx,</v>

60
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:52.501
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>

61
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:55.560
<v Speaker 1>they did more than sit next to each other in the dining room.</v>

62
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Then he invited her to his room.</v>

63
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>They hung a do not disturb sign on the door and at breakfast the next morning,</v>

64
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.530
<v Speaker 1>they both sported broad smiles,</v>

65
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.650
<v Speaker 1>terrible writing like a fourth grade,</v>

66
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>but also calling it.</v>

67
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.370
<v Speaker 1>What are the top say that you see the new erotic frontier.</v>

68
00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

69
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.751
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

70
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's like sex and nursing homes.</v>

71
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

72
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

73
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>there goes the boner.</v>

74
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>it sounded so hot.</v>

76
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

77
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>that's not.</v>

78
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not exciting for me,</v>

79
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.650
<v Speaker 1>but there's a whole category on youporn that so old people do.</v>

80
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Some people do like watching old people.</v>

81
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:28.944
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

82
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:29.941
<v Speaker 1>when I watched the other day,</v>

84
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:30.661
<v Speaker 1>I'm not proud of it,</v>

85
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>but I will admit it to you.</v>

86
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I watched an old thing,</v>

87
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:34.284
<v Speaker 1>my special.</v>

88
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I watched an old porn stars still at it.</v>

89
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what he provides.</v>

90
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Exercise or this topic,</v>

91
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>and at the time of life,</v>

92
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>when many elderly feel cold sleeping as a payer provides warmth.</v>

93
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

94
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>that's cute.</v>

95
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Look at this though.</v>

96
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Killed back to that.</v>

97
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Relationships make people happier and that happiness reduces stress and</v>

98
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>irritability and improves mood,</v>

99
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>appetite,</v>

100
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>

101
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>sociability and immune function.</v>

102
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Plants.</v>

103
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Read that first.</v>

104
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

105
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>how dare you read the first sentence says the Hebrew home,</v>

106
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 1>that first one at the bottom of the Hebrew home does more than tolerate resident</v>

107
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:12.364
<v Speaker 1>nookie.</v>

108
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.880
<v Speaker 1>The faculty hope probably someone who works at the Hebrew home propaganda that</v>

109
00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>faculty holds regular happy hours,</v>

110
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.011
<v Speaker 1>dances,</v>

111
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>and even organized a dating service for residents.</v>

112
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.563
<v Speaker 1>Gy Date,</v>

113
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>g four grandparents.</v>

114
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.393
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

115
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to force you into bringing up that subject.</v>

116
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

117
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>the other problem with the second season of fear factor,</v>

118
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:36.200
<v Speaker 1>and I can say this now because it didn't happen as I was worried we were going</v>

119
00:03:36.201 --> 00:03:37.034
<v Speaker 1>to kill somebody.</v>

120
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I was really worried.</v>

121
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 1>It seemed too dangerous.</v>

122
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>They were ramping up the stents and they were making things like way more</v>

123
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>spectacular and you're,</v>

124
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>you're just taking bigger chances and there was a lot of downtime in between.</v>

125
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of preparation.</v>

126
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of like checks and balances and they really wanted to make sure</v>

127
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>that everything was tested and tested and they really mapped it out well,</v>

128
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>but it was still.</v>

129
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>There were some hair raising things he's fucking people had to do.</v>

130
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Maybe fear was too far,</v>

131
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>maybe it should've been like mildly uncomfortable factor where you put people</v>

132
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>like an mildly uncomfortable situations.</v>

133
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

134
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.481
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

135
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>I want you to go over and talk to that woman.</v>

136
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>She seems kind of attractive.</v>

137
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.820
<v Speaker 1>What I mean.</v>

138
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of a mildly uncomfortable and you.</v>

139
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to die.</v>

140
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.170
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to mind if she kills you there.</v>

141
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

142
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>they're doing a new one with ludicrous.</v>

143
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda that way.</v>

144
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a new fear factor and ludicrous.</v>

145
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>The rapper is the host and like some of the fears like forgetting your cell</v>

146
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 1>phone somewhere like for like,</v>

147
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

148
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.841
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

149
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Something stupid like that.</v>

150
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And they don't have to eat anything gross.</v>

151
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.393
<v Speaker 1>Which was,</v>

152
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 1>it was really dumped and keep that out because that was one of the most popular</v>

153
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>parts of the original series that was gigantic.</v>

154
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Like the eating gross shit part as huge.</v>

155
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I have to be honest with you.</v>

156
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:00.930
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

157
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't watch that.</v>

158
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>That was the hard part for me.</v>

159
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.573
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

160
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.483
<v Speaker 1>I hear you,</v>

161
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.580
<v Speaker 1>it was hard for me to watch somebody do something because I wouldn't eat it or</v>

163
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:12.431
<v Speaker 1>drink it.</v>

164
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Then I don't want to watch somebody else do that,</v>

165
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>

166
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.963
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>

167
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

168
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have won.</v>

169
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

170
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.603
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

171
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I watched somebody sent me a clip of Steve Hoe with a gas mask on and I tweeted</v>

172
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:27.364
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

173
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.860
<v Speaker 1>some guy farting into a tube and it goes right into Steve [inaudible] face and</v>

174
00:05:32.861 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 1>he threw up into the mask and I laughed so hard that I retweeted it</v>

175
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>and send it to me.</v>

176
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.090
<v Speaker 1>It was actually quite rude of him,</v>

177
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.470
<v Speaker 1>but it was in response to allies of slessinger his appearance yesterday,</v>

178
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>the podcast.</v>

182
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] face like this.</v>

185
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I almost threw up right there.</v>

186
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:11.204
<v Speaker 1>I almost threw up.</v>

200
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Let's make some real entertainment.</v>

201
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 2>And the radio program director came into my town knew and you know if you've</v>

202
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:55.491
<v Speaker 2>ever been in radio,</v>

203
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 2>when they come into town,</v>

204
00:06:56.331 --> 00:06:58.320
<v Speaker 2>knew the first thing they're going to do is change everything because they got</v>

205
00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:00.140
<v Speaker 2>to put their own stamp on it or why are they there?</v>

206
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 2>So this guy comes in and he goes,</v>

207
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna rebrand you.</v>

208
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.741
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

209
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 2>I want everyone to think of your name and instantly think of the brand and I'm</v>

210
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:07.551
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>

211
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

212
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:08.430
<v Speaker 2>brand.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

214
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:08.841
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

215
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 2>So here's what he said.</v>

216
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 2>So I hate to say this because this will become a meme online that I will have to</v>

217
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:13.754
<v Speaker 2>live with the rest of it,</v>

218
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's an absolutely true story.</v>

219
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.250
<v Speaker 2>So the guy says to me,</v>

220
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:16.491
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

221
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 2>listen to imagine a billboard that says Dan Carlin,</v>

222
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.840
<v Speaker 2>he fucks chickens.</v>

223
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.951
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

224
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:22.491
<v Speaker 2>excuse me?</v>

225
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:22.761
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

226
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:22.941
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

227
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

228
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.070
<v Speaker 2>so that anytime anybody thought they would think,</v>

229
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:25.311
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

230
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 2>he's the chicken fucker and I'm going,</v>

231
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:27.520
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

232
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.920
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

233
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.800
<v Speaker 2>He really said that.</v>

234
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:29.900
<v Speaker 2>And I said to him,</v>

235
00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

236
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 2>I said two things dude.</v>

237
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.091
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

238
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:34.220
<v Speaker 2>the first thing is I got to live in this town,</v>

239
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

240
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 2>So really you want that to be the first thing people think.</v>

241
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:37.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

242
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.090
<v Speaker 2>The second thing is I got to have a career after this stupid idea of yours</v>

243
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:41.924
<v Speaker 2>fails,</v>

244
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

245
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

246
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.191
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

247
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand where we're building up a mental image,</v>

248
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 2>you will be a household name.</v>

249
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:46.911
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

250
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:47.121
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

251
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 2>I'll be the household name.</v>

252
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:49.180
<v Speaker 2>The guy who fucks chickens</v>

253
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.740
<v Speaker 2>and finding no,</v>

254
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:51.981
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

255
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 2>After that I finally.</v>

256
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:53.601
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

257
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

258
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.210
<v Speaker 2>do you want to step outside right now?</v>

259
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.540
<v Speaker 2>My wife laughed at me because I'm already an old man when I'm saying she goes,</v>

260
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.321
<v Speaker 2>that would have been great.</v>

261
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:00.531
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

262
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:00.651
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

263
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:00.920
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

264
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 2>this guy was as old as I was,</v>

265
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:07.151
<v Speaker 2>but I was so incensed and so angry that this guy would be so cavalier with your</v>

266
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.960
<v Speaker 2>future and as a human being in every family.</v>

267
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

268
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.383
<v Speaker 2>my kids,</v>

269
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.240
<v Speaker 2>how are they going to spell fucker on billboards?</v>

270
00:08:15.241 --> 00:08:15.651
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

271
00:08:15.651 --> 00:08:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Pets have really good credit they might have had as a euphemism,</v>

272
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:18.801
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

273
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:19.461
<v Speaker 2>you think about that.</v>

274
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:19.701
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

275
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:20.300
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

276
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:20.901
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

277
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 2>this guy's career depends on him making a difference.</v>

278
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a tool in his career.</v>

279
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

280
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 2>So you start to realize that when you did the podcast and it's your podcast,</v>

281
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 2>the person that you're worried about here is you and not just that,</v>

282
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.250
<v Speaker 2>the ideas that are coming from your.</v>

283
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Not just yours alone,</v>

284
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:38.324
<v Speaker 2>but you own them.</v>

285
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:38.781
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

286
00:08:38.781 --> 00:08:39.100
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

287
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 2>so when I say something that's stupid,</v>

288
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:41.811
<v Speaker 2>I own that.</v>

289
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not like some stations said,</v>

290
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 2>oh listen,</v>

291
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.180
<v Speaker 2>push.</v>

292
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:44.421
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

293
00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I got into a fight over the Oj Simpson thing when the Oj Simpson trial is going</v>

294
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:48.441
<v Speaker 2>on and everybody,</v>

295
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:49.490
<v Speaker 2>it's all you hear anywhere,</v>

296
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.260
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't talk about it and so they got on me about not talking about it.</v>

297
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 2>I had a big fight and I walked into the studio and I said,</v>

298
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.821
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

299
00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:57.391
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk about it.</v>

300
00:08:57.391 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

301
00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

302
00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 2>the whole topic was,</v>

303
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 2>isn't there just too much?</v>

304
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Damn Oj Simpson everywhere you go.</v>

305
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:02.671
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

306
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:02.970
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

307
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

308
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.110
<v Speaker 2>they were at the,</v>

309
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

310
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 2>there was a window.</v>

311
00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 2>We were like zoo creatures and I had this window,</v>

312
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:10.500
<v Speaker 2>they could bring all the sales clients to watch us perform and I'm doing there</v>

313
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.530
<v Speaker 2>and there's like five executives in the window just waiting till the next</v>

314
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:15.850
<v Speaker 2>commercial break because we're going to be what I mean,</v>

315
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.540
<v Speaker 2>that's why radio is so awful for me and I didn't get fired.</v>

316
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 2>I must've done a good enough job to stay employed,</v>

317
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.530
<v Speaker 2>but it was go home and pull your hair out.</v>
