<v Speaker 1>the belly room and we were in the green </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

7
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his voice is so commercial.</v>

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Like it sounds like that God damn car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll never be able to separate them.</v>

9
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Now I know I shouldn't say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial.</v>

10
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Just say that series of commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of those fucking things you'd </v>

11
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.640
<v Speaker 1>done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

13
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.631

<v Speaker 1>I just do sessions and then they do </v>

14
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should do other shit man.</v>

15
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>If you were just doing that and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>became the verizon guy,</v>

16
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you hear me now?</v>

17
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's fucked.</v>

18
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Fuck fucked.</v>

19
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>You're getting a dell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that guy's fucked.</v>

20
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.690
<v Speaker 1>How about the girl?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The insurance girl.</v>

21
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>It's always know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a name?</v>

22
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they.</v>

23
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>At least they keep making those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is fucked once she's done though,</v>

24
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>but she's probably made a killing by </v>
<v Speaker 1>this point.</v>

25
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it worth it?</v>

26
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.830
<v Speaker 1>The first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that guy from that fucking </v>

27
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>commercial that always gets in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidents and falls down and gets hurt,</v>

28
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>you know that a handsome gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

29
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:06.520
<v Speaker 1>they cast him in a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in movies too.</v>

30
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>He's always in movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in John Wick.</v>

31
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>He's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Wick was good,</v>

32
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

33
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>What I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

34
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I just haven't watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's no like brilliant,</v>

35
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>like super creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undeniable work of art.</v>

36
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>But it's funny shit as far as like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really wild,</v>

37
00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:26.470
<v Speaker 1>crazy entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

38
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.360
<v Speaker 1>it's like crazy action sequence.</v>

39
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.400
<v Speaker 1>The craziest is the guy who directed it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a fight coordinator apparently,</v>

40
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.320
<v Speaker 1>so he just had ideas for like the ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd never given people I think.</v>

41
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he was like,</v>

42
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>eh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we just saved it.</v>

43
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>He needs a sandbag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must have worked for and then and </v>

44
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.060
<v Speaker 1>then unleashed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not work with writers like </v>

45
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.091
<v Speaker 1>you're a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that work with writers </v>

46
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:53.091
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you see like,</v>

47
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>like specific writers are writing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else,</v>

48
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>like a monologue or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're getting at.</v>

49
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

50
00:01:58.801 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

51
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>There are certain jokes that like if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing for like rock or something,</v>

52
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>it's usually for like the bet awards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like a.</v>

53
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:14.391
<v Speaker 1>It would have done that in my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have done that topical joke </v>

54
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:16.941
<v Speaker 1>about usher in my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about monologues,</v>

55
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like pretty disposable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

56
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>I know I every now and then people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>snl that sucked as writers and then they</v>

57
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>became cast members and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit a lot of good ideas.</v>

58
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.730
<v Speaker 1>They just store them all like squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Just like totally sandbag because comics</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like inherently kind of self </v>

60
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>obsessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:39.621
<v Speaker 1>and the idea of like writing selflessly </v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone else and making them much </v>

62
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:44.691
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to somebody about this </v>

63
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we,</v>

64
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.780
<v Speaker 1>it's an accepted thing in comedy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the accepted caste system that</v>

65
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>rock is basically saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

66
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm funnier than you and I'm hosting </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelves.</v>

67
00:02:55.961 --> 00:03:00.961
<v Speaker 1>So fucking Gimme jokes it based on what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world saying.</v>

68
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's that explicit.</v>

69
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.920
<v Speaker 1>There is at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something flattering about the </v>

70
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.920
<v Speaker 1>fact that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best comics wants me to run,</v>

71
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also something about like,</v>

72
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>you come here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rub my back,</v>

73
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>hey other MMA fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come rub my back,</v>

74
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.370
<v Speaker 1>this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ranked higher than you.</v>

75
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 1>So come around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My bug was just like,</v>

76
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:22.680
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can pay and all that stuff.</v>

77
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Think of it that way at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of it as,</v>

78
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

79
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't.</v>

80
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.370
<v Speaker 1>It's very intelligent for him because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the smart way to do it in a lot of </v>

81
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>people don't do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't bring in other people to help</v>

82
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>them and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're working kind of suffer,</v>

83
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's pretty smart in that way that </v>

84
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>he's like looking at objects that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other strong people around.</v>

85
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>If I bring them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll make my already strong act.</v>

86
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Even do it for his act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll do it for a TV show monologue.</v>

87
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.200
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's not.</v>

88
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing with rock is it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally you write stuff for him.</v>

89
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>And sent it to him so that he can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>confident in his shit.</v>

90
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

91
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:03.860
<v Speaker 1>my shit's better than this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fun.</v>

92
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Well you just need like a giant mound of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit to chop away at.</v>

93
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 1>And then you find where the gems are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you only have like a few,</v>

94
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 1>like pretty decent ideas and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to build them up,</v>

95
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:20.041
<v Speaker 1>that's way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way less effective than an enormous </v>

96
00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>catalog of ideas need to turn to present</v>
<v Speaker 1>x ones.</v>

97
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a rock.</v>

98
00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Always says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

100
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have comedy writers around the way </v>

101
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 1>rappers have gold chains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's all he spent his money on.</v>

102
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if he's gonna,</v>

103
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>he's not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not gonna buy a chain.</v>

104
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:38.131
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just have a writer write for </v>

105
00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 1>fucking a movie with Marisa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's smart.</v>

106
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why he's Chris Rock.</v>

107
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>He's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

108
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:46.741
<v Speaker 1>as effective strategy for optimizing all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his shows and all of the sets and </v>

109
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:47.390
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.400
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows the fee on the thing that I </v>

111
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.400
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

112
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>When you were saying about having other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people come in.</v>

113
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that a lot of guys,</v>

114
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>comedian wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get to the theater level,</v>

115
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.450

<v Speaker 1>it's basically all your audiences are </v>

116
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 1>henpecked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of your audiences are predisposed to</v>

117
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 1>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever scan?</v>

118
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>What I found is a lot of people when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they go to theaters,</v>

119
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 1>they're acting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're plateaus or gets worse.</v>

120
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever specifically go to rooms </v>

121
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 1>where they don't know you're coming to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a better read on shit?</v>

122
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

123
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:29.431
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of sets during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like regular sets at the Improv or the </v>

124
00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 1>store where they're there to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a wide variety of people.</v>

125
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think those are important,</v>

126
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.390
<v Speaker 1>I think sets at the store important </v>
<v Speaker 1>period because it's a fucking jaded </v>

127
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.480
<v Speaker 1>group down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful and magical,</v>

128
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:41.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's jaded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

129
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.410
<v Speaker 1>It's the hardest thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Belly Room.</v>

130
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might as well be doing standup for </v>

131
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.700
<v Speaker 1>one person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

132
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.130
<v Speaker 1>People are right in front of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst part of the belly room is </v>

133
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.070
<v Speaker 1>there's people to the right that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>just charge the stage right there.</v>

134
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Fucking it.</v>

135
00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also,</v>

136
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 2>they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great though,</v>

137
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 2>like what we're all were saying about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing,</v>

138
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:10.391
<v Speaker 2>like the worst part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even the worst part about it is </v>

139
00:06:10.391 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 2>magic because that room is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>magic,</v>

140
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That belly room,</v>

141
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 2>if you get something to work and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>belly room.</v>

142
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.350
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about this last night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's the belly room and the Ice </v>

143
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 2>House and the Ice House is maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best club ever.</v>

144
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 2>It's got the rep and having done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the easiest,</v>

145
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.070
<v Speaker 2>easiest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

146
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well let's just set up.</v>

147
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

148
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 2>The ceiling is low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's stuffed in there.</v>

149
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 2>It's very contagious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laughter is great.</v>

150
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:38.351
<v Speaker 2>Acoustics saw wood everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The laughter really reverberates and </v>

151
00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:42.881
<v Speaker 2>it's got whatever the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifty years of comedy burned into the </v>

152
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 2>walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the oldest club in the country.</v>

153
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it's older than 50 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

154
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>

155
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like 55 years old or </v>

156
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the irl.</v>

157
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.160
<v Speaker 2>It's essentially the oldest comedy club </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Earth because the oldest clubs for </v>

158
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.560
<v Speaker 2>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in America,</v>

159
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.720
<v Speaker 2>so the oldest one in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's the oldest,</v>

160
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:03.290
<v Speaker 2>longest running club ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's super rare place,</v>

161
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's way easier than like the Olr or</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the belly room.</v>

162
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Different kind of Louis say in</v>

163
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.830
<v Speaker 3>an interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when he does,</v>

164
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.690
<v Speaker 3>when he's in La,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll go,</v>

165
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.990
<v Speaker 3>he'll do like an alternative show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he'll do the Improv or the laugh </v>

166
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:23.800
<v Speaker 3>factory and then he'll do the store and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like if it works,</v>

167
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.340
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything will work on alternative </v>

168
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.021
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some stuff will work at the Improv and </v>

169
00:07:31.021 --> 00:07:33.180
<v Speaker 3>one thing will work at the store and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing that works with the store that</v>

170
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.170
<v Speaker 3>keeps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's smart.</v>

171
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

172
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:41.730
<v Speaker 2>So you need all of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when I was just doing the store </v>

173
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.130
<v Speaker 2>only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my ax suffered a little bit.</v>

174
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.930
<v Speaker 2>I think where does it go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the thing.</v>

175
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:44.760
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to</v>

176
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 3>the psychographic of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think they [inaudible] I still </v>

177
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.180
<v Speaker 3>couldn't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having been working there six,</v>

178
00:07:51.181 --> 00:07:56.181
<v Speaker 3>seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still couldn't tell you like the </v>

179
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:57.921
<v Speaker 3>psychology of that kind of part of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of the average of the audience's </v>

180
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.360
<v Speaker 3>collective unconscious.</v>

181
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

182
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 2>let me just say this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way better now.</v>

183
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 2>The second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my second run of the store from 2007 on.</v>

184
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I started up again December 14.</v>

185
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.020
<v Speaker 2>It's way better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just better.</v>

186
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a better club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The young guys coming up are better.</v>

187
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:19.730
<v Speaker 2>There's a better vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The audiences are better.</v>

188
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was there in the,</v>

189
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.640
<v Speaker 2>in the early two thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

190
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I was a war zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all old.</v>

191
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.120
<v Speaker 2>It was all old timers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

192
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:28.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a lot of world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was also.</v>

193
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:33.131
<v Speaker 2>The audience was just like monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of months like rapey dm </v>

194
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.280
<v Speaker 2>hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goalie,</v>

195
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.620
<v Speaker 2>drunky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No crowd control at all.</v>

196
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:41.621
<v Speaker 2>They have real crowd control now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll kick people out if they're </v>

197
00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:41.621
<v Speaker 2>retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

198
00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 2>They didn't use to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll kick people out.</v>

199
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.990
<v Speaker 2>If they say eight things you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

200
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.090
<v Speaker 2>You have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

201
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Ate any of these gloves like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's fucking get them out.</v>

203
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.250
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they say more than one thing,</v>

204
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:53.960
<v Speaker 2>get them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kicked the guy out at the ice house</v>

<v Speaker 2>while the bit was going on and I </v>

<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

212
00:09:06.651 --> 00:09:11.651
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about the thing on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>part because we're not having a </v>

213
00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:11.651
<v Speaker 2>conversation is a fucking show.</v>

215
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when the bouncers come over to </v>

216
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:16.760
<v Speaker 2>take him away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

217
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.660
<v Speaker 2>are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was helping.</v>

218
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just picked you.</v>

219
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 2>They just randomly picked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy decided to fuck with them.</v>

220
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said the other day to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman who was yelling.</v>

221
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to fucking Katy Perry concert,</v>

222
00:09:27.431 --> 00:09:30.120
<v Speaker 1>sit at the bar at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and just sing along with her.</v>

223
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't need your help.</v>

224
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.120
<v Speaker 1>They didn't book the show and go those </v>
<v Speaker 1>four guys and then hopefully someone </v>

225
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.120
<v Speaker 1>will come and heckle them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

226
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.951
<v Speaker 1>but a Katy Perry concert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go and sit there and sing along </v>

227
00:09:42.951 --> 00:09:42.951
<v Speaker 1>with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably flatter area.</v>

228
00:09:42.951 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're trying to,</v>

229
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.830
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're at the foot of the stage doing</v>

230
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:51.831
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the worst would be if you </v>

231
00:09:51.831 --> 00:09:51.831
<v Speaker 1>were saying don't sing that song </v>
<v Speaker 1>precise.</v>

232
00:09:51.831 --> 00:09:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Don't you have another song?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which mayor was telling me the name drop</v>

233
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:01.370
<v Speaker 1>a was saying that the biggest issue at </v>
<v Speaker 1>his shows now girls running to the foot </v>

234
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:08.001
<v Speaker 1>of the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turning their back to them and taking a </v>

235
00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:08.001
<v Speaker 1>selfie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 1>he's at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he has security to like stop it.</v>

237
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like if I didn't stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'd be hundreds of people every year</v>

238
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:20.080
<v Speaker 1>and it's hugely distracting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing starting at the thing </v>

239
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.080
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at.</v>

240
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

241
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.111
<v Speaker 2>don't you find distracting when you look</v>
<v Speaker 2>out into the crowd and you see like 10 </v>

242
00:10:24.111 --> 00:10:27.651
<v Speaker 2>phones up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the photos of you or taking a </v>

243
00:10:27.651 --> 00:10:28.470
<v Speaker 2>selfie or taking picture with Neil </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brune.</v>

244
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.500
<v Speaker 2>She'll kill it at Hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag winning.</v>

245
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:38.721
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag tiger blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many people want to </v>

246
00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:41.640
<v Speaker 2>take pictures now that Hannibal burress </v>
<v Speaker 2>did some weird thing at one of his shows</v>

247
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.530
<v Speaker 2>where they have some new technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a pouch and they give you this</v>

248
00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:47.640
<v Speaker 2>pouch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close it.</v>

249
00:10:47.641 --> 00:10:52.641
<v Speaker 2>And when you're inside the club the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pouch doesn't open so you can't get to </v>

250
00:10:52.641 --> 00:10:53.970
<v Speaker 2>your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if your phone rings,</v>

251
00:10:53.971 --> 00:10:57.330
<v Speaker 2>if you feel like you must answer it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to leave the venue and then the</v>

252
00:10:57.331 --> 00:11:02.331
<v Speaker 2>patch will open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it works on some sort of like a </v>

253
00:11:02.331 --> 00:11:04.970
<v Speaker 2>frequency if you're past like one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those electronic dog collars,</v>

254
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:05.700
<v Speaker 2>you know those things.</v>

255
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

256
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:10.200
<v Speaker 2>the reaction to it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

257
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 2>I was reading all the reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I tweeted it.</v>

258
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

259
00:11:15.121 --> 00:11:16.350
<v Speaker 2>because I saw the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

260
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.220
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of interesting.</v>

261
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:19.890
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how people feel about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that I would implement it,</v>

262
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.740
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the streisand effect is in </v>

263
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:25.740
<v Speaker 2>effect the streisand effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

264
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Barbara Streisand,</v>

265
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.910
<v Speaker 2>they found her house and they put her </v>
<v Speaker 2>house online like they,</v>

266
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone took a photo of it and like</v>

267
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.260
<v Speaker 2>this is where Barbara streisand's </v>
<v Speaker 2>houses.</v>

268
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.060
<v Speaker 2>And so she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

269
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.670
<v Speaker 2>was offended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She made this big deal and she's like,</v>

270
00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:40.890
<v Speaker 2>fuck you take my house down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and that.</v>

271
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.280
<v Speaker 2>And because she put so much effort into </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting the fact that our house was </v>

272
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.391
<v Speaker 2>down way more people knew about her </v>
<v Speaker 2>house and they all attacked and went </v>

273
00:11:50.391 --> 00:11:54.161
<v Speaker 2>after her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you tell people she can't </v>

274
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:54.161
<v Speaker 2>bring your cell phone to my show,</v>

<v Speaker 4>glasses that has the lens in the sense </v>

<v Speaker 4>that's the way to deal with it.</v>

349
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.290
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then the girl could say,</v>

350
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:51.920
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was</v>

351
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 1>thinking we're going to make out and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as I signed it,</v>

352
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:55.990
<v Speaker 1>he just started raping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

353
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>

354
00:14:57.531 --> 00:14:58.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

358
00:15:06.141 --> 00:15:09.380

<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

359
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.300
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all bets are off,</v>

360
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:14.270

<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

361
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I would think that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but an opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If bill cosby's raping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what chance did the rest of us have?</v>

465
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Does that the biggest shock that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever heard in all my years of.</v>

466
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

467
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Because I met him 20 years ago and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a fucking dick and when his show </v>

468
00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 1>started the sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

469
00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

470
00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I promise you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a 10 year old,</v>

471
00:19:59.971 --> 00:20:00.960
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that guy.</v>

472
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.870
<v Speaker 1>It's Just a fucking ego maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it from the mit.</v>

473
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm rarely that write about something.</v>

474
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Rarely do I not like someone and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn out to be like a serial rapist,</v>

475
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:14.070
<v Speaker 1>but usually you're just kind of a dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to become a c,</v>

476
00:20:14.071 --> 00:20:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

477
00:20:14.581 --> 00:20:16.680
<v Speaker 1>that totally makes sense for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever made it,</v>

478
00:20:16.681 --> 00:20:18.180
<v Speaker 1>met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had this,</v>

479
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.260
<v Speaker 1>you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd made them?</v>

480
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figured it out.</v>

481
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't never liked the sitcom.</v>

482
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Thought i was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

483
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I went to college,</v>

484
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
<v Speaker 1>nyu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an essay in some english lit </v>

485
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.971
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say explaining what the formula for the </v>

486
00:20:34.971 --> 00:20:36.920
<v Speaker 1>show was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was um,</v>

487
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.540
<v Speaker 1>the kids have an original idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

488
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:46.660
<v Speaker 1>an original design and original idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then bill cosby spends the episode </v>

489
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.820
<v Speaker 1>chopping them down and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

490
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what every episode was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hated it just as a kid.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

503
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.251
<v Speaker 1>I was a doorman down here and went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>and met the woman who works at the </v>

504
00:21:29.691 --> 00:21:34.050
<v Speaker 1>arcenio and through dave and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was like,</v>

505
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.220
<v Speaker 1>and whenever there's somebody cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>launch,</v>

506
00:21:35.221 --> 00:21:40.221
<v Speaker 1>it's like come and meet someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So met him and he was talking about </v>

507

<v Speaker 1>slavery and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was me,</v>

509
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.430
<v Speaker 1>he because he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the dutch man came and pointed </v>

510
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.720
<v Speaker 1>at me and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not dutch,</v>

511
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:54.920
<v Speaker 1>but he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

512
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.620
<v Speaker 1>close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that he would point them in</v>

513
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:57.820
<v Speaker 1>because we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what are the odds?</v>

515
00:21:58.931 --> 00:22:03.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that he just pointed at me </v>

516
00:22:03.931 --> 00:22:07.270
<v Speaker 1>and was any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a predator like wildly smug guy.</v>

517

<v Speaker 1>Wildly smug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

520
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.380
<v Speaker 1>smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not as.</v>

521
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.500
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those guys will talk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then say in other words,</v>

522
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.940
<v Speaker 1>four times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

523
00:22:18.941 --> 00:22:20.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making the same point for them.</v>

524
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Like I got it the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

525
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.100
<v Speaker 1>To impress themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

526
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.050
<v Speaker 1>In my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

527
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smart.</v>

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Like really smart people at god damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>w w,</v>

529
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.910
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing here with wrestling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we having a conversation like,</v>

530
00:22:33.911 --> 00:22:35.020
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they're not,</v>

531
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:36.830
<v Speaker 1>you're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

532
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:42.390
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter who they're talking </v>

533
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.390
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just a warm.</v>

534
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.390
<v Speaker 1>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

535
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.600
<v Speaker 1>if they're the predator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just like fucking red.</v>

536
00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Like you're just a thing that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking at.</v>

537
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the heat signature.</v>

538
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:50.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

539
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.830
<v Speaker 1>you're a walking heats so they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking die.</v>

540
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that to me was the only thing that </v>

541
00:22:59.840 --> 00:22:59.840
<v Speaker 1>made sense about this.</v>

542
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like how could someone drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody like that.</v>

543
00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:07.351
<v Speaker 1>And I've thought about and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet if you have lived decade after </v>

544
00:23:07.351 --> 00:23:11.611
<v Speaker 1>decade of people just kissing her ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone around you is like some </v>

545
00:23:11.611 --> 00:23:16.051
<v Speaker 1>weird form of a yes man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have a whole industry behind </v>

546
00:23:16.051 --> 00:23:16.051
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

547
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:21.210
<v Speaker 1>but he's on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like think about he has all the </v>

548
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.061
<v Speaker 1>production assistants and the producers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the executive producers and the </v>

549
00:23:24.061 --> 00:23:25.550
<v Speaker 1>cameraman and the sound guys and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>makeup people and everyone is just,</v>

550
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:31.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mr cosby and that's your existence and </v>

551
00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.810
<v Speaker 1>you get onstage in front of that crowd </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're making this show and he's </v>

552
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.990
<v Speaker 1>american killer comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fUcking killer.</v>

553
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm saying he's,</v>

554
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:43.890
<v Speaker 1>he's a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And think that you just developed this </v>

555
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 1>sort of like really distorted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotic view</v>

556
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.950
<v Speaker 2>of yourself in relationship to the rest </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world?</v>

557
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so because he's the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>famous person that's,</v>

558
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.390
<v Speaker 3>I think he had the pathology before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was famous.</v>

559
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.990
<v Speaker 3>the idea that I've never heard of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>famous person like,</v>

560
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.200
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my shit now is I got to the drug </v>

561
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:05.870
<v Speaker 3>bitches in and rape them when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>asleep level.</v>

562
00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Like that's not a level that's not like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a known itself.</v>

563
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.290
<v Speaker 3>So I think it was the thing that he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>

564
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:18.580
<v Speaker 3>In some ways I don't feel bad for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what do you do you know,</v>

565
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 3>any sexual desire you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eventually going to do.</v>

566
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:29.540
<v Speaker 3>You can quell it for four nights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you say like if you have that,</v>

567
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.160
<v Speaker 3>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of creepy.</v>

568
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a this american life </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a guy who was a pedophile.</v>

569
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.000
<v Speaker 3>He was 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a pedophile.</v>

570
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.300
<v Speaker 3>One of the had sexual feelings for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>

571
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 3>12 year old boys hadn't acted on It and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

572
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.770
<v Speaker 3>what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus christ.</v>

573
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.130
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why when people go so and so like</v>

574
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.480
<v Speaker 3>prostitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

575
00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:52.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like a transvestite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

576
00:24:52.551 --> 00:24:56.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like poor him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in some ways it's like you're gonna</v>

577
00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:00.710
<v Speaker 3>your dick makes you do awful shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I believe he had that before.</v>

578
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Before he was famous or anything I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's.</v>

579
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that part is</v>

580
00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:11.620
<v Speaker 2>that this was a more commonly accepted </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice because he had a bit that he </v>

581
00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:11.670
<v Speaker 2>used to do about.</v>

582
00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

583
00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.960
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if like people didn't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was that big of a deal or as big</v>

584
00:25:18.961 --> 00:25:23.961
<v Speaker 2>of a deal as they think of now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe people didn't think of </v>

585
00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:25.030
<v Speaker 2>hitting someone with a mickey that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>called.</v>

586
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.870
<v Speaker 2>They had a cute lIttle name for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas now it's like drug raids.</v>

587
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

588
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me that spanish fly argument was a.</v>

589
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.830
<v Speaker 3>That just sounded like one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember back in the day,</v>

590
00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:41.831
<v Speaker 3>but it's like remember speaking spell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of those bits for </v>

591
00:25:41.831 --> 00:25:41.831
<v Speaker 3>regeneration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

592
00:25:41.831 --> 00:25:44.330
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was way more like there was,</v>

593
00:25:44.331 --> 00:25:49.331
<v Speaker 3>I was reading about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the girls who lived at hugh </v>

594
00:25:49.331 --> 00:25:51.641
<v Speaker 3>hefner's house and he offered her a loot</v>
<v Speaker 3>and saId back in the old days they used </v>

595
00:25:51.641 --> 00:25:54.380
<v Speaker 3>to call these lego openers or thigh </v>
<v Speaker 3>openers.</v>

596
00:25:54.381 --> 00:25:56.250
<v Speaker 3>And it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it.</v>

597
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:59.080
<v Speaker 3>I believe that they use vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

598
00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

599
00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:04.250
<v Speaker 3>women even 30 years ago didn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of rights,</v>

600
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.880
<v Speaker 3>like sexual harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the first sexual </v>

601
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.850
<v Speaker 3>harassment suit was tilt if I'm at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earliest.</v>

602
00:26:10.851 --> 00:26:11.870
<v Speaker 3>It was the late seventies.</v>

603
00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.980
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how much things have </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>

604
00:26:14.981 --> 00:26:18.820
<v Speaker 2>And how quickly things have changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were reading yesterday on the podcast</v>

605
00:26:18.821 --> 00:26:20.140
<v Speaker 2>was yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>day before yesterday,</v>

606
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.490
<v Speaker 2>this speech by lincoln when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>debating like 18,</v>

607
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.970
<v Speaker 2>58 to be debating the rights of black </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

608
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:33.160
<v Speaker 2>And even lincoln back then was saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he didn't think that they should be</v>

609
00:26:33.161 --> 00:26:37.690
<v Speaker 2>allowed to serve on juries or vote or </v>
<v Speaker 2>even intermarry with whites.</v>

610
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:39.000
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

611
00:26:39.001 --> 00:26:40.750
<v Speaker 2>like that's not that long ago.</v>

612
00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.970
<v Speaker 3>I thought that there were four fifths of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person.</v>

613
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 3>Like you're</v>

614
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.910
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

615
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.840
<v Speaker 2>you're not three fifths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not fun either.</v>

616
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.440
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument is,</v>

617
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.560
<v Speaker 2>well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to put it into context like his</v>

618
00:26:52.561 --> 00:26:55.280
<v Speaker 2>time during his time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was revolutionary.</v>

619
00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.630
<v Speaker 2>That was progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's incredibly progressive.</v>

620
00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that long ago,</v>

621
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:01.120
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so long ago at all.</v>

622
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:06.410
<v Speaker 2>That's done even 200 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's cool is that peer that we're </v>

623
00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:09.471
<v Speaker 2>living in now as you can get rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this shit is like the gay rights </v>

624
00:27:09.481 --> 00:27:10.430
<v Speaker 2>movement and the trans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

625
00:27:10.431 --> 00:27:12.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a movement like this.</v>

626
00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:17.550
<v Speaker 2>Them get traction writes things amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

627
00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.860
<v Speaker 2>They're starting to get gay marriage all</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the country.</v>

628
00:27:19.861 --> 00:27:21.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like popping up pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>

629
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:21.970
<v Speaker 2>pop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

630
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.760
<v Speaker 2>it's a cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was stupid anyway,</v>

631
00:27:23.761 --> 00:27:25.920
<v Speaker 2>but first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest.</v>

632
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.120
<v Speaker 2>Marriage is pretty fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Retarded.</v>

633
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.400
<v Speaker 2>This is coming from a married person.</v>

634
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of like you're going to sign a </v>

635
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.430
<v Speaker 2>contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of based on romance.</v>

636
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

637
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>

638
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.770
<v Speaker 2>I get that you'd want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd want some sort of security,</v>

639
00:27:37.771 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 2>but if you're gay and you can't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>

640
00:27:39.811 --> 00:27:44.640
<v Speaker 2>People can't even get pregnant unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys figure out how to eat.</v>

641
00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.820
<v Speaker 2>You have to get a surrogate or you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talkIng about,</v>

642
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:53.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe friends that are also lesbians </v>

643
00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.091

<v Speaker 2>how do you work it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to be your kids.</v>

646
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.480
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that wasn't about that.</v>

647
00:28:00.481 --> 00:28:02.610
<v Speaker 2>It was about like you also couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>visit.</v>

648
00:28:02.611 --> 00:28:06.230
<v Speaker 2>You're over the hump so you couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't get insurance rights,</v>

649
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.050
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

650
00:28:07.051 --> 00:28:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't want to get married,</v>

651
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a quality.</v>

652
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:17.540
<v Speaker 2>You know you want to be able to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to fucking law that says </v>

653
00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:18.340

<v Speaker 2>Can't marry another man that he loves.</v>

654
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.720
<v Speaker 2>That's gross and stupid and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that was common until really </v>

655
00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:27.570
<v Speaker 2>recently and the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it aIn't writing well,</v>

656
00:28:27.571 --> 00:28:29.700
<v Speaker 2>that's not a fucking art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ain't right.</v>

657
00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:32.670
<v Speaker 2>It's not a legal argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still been going on today.</v>

658
00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:35.010
<v Speaker 2>These guys that are running for </v>
<v Speaker 2>republican office,</v>

659
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.100
<v Speaker 2>it's still happening today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

660
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Rick santorum was just talking about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>

664
00:28:50.241 --> 00:28:53.001

665
00:28:53.001 --> 00:28:54.150
<v Speaker 2>to that stupidity that are still on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their side for now.</v>

666
00:28:54.151 --> 00:28:59.151
<v Speaker 2>They're like the last fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>confederate flag holdouts and is it is </v>

667
00:28:59.151 --> 00:29:03.741
<v Speaker 2>there or is there not something in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bible about it because I've heard some </v>

668
00:29:03.741 --> 00:29:05.310
<v Speaker 2>men are not supposed to lie down with </v>
<v Speaker 2>men and it's an abomination.</v>

669
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:09.690
<v Speaker 2>That's what it saYs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it says who you're dealing with.</v>

670
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.530
<v Speaker 2>MulTiple translations was to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

671
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:14.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

672
00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:17.190
<v Speaker 2>there's more than 2000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oldest versions of the bible that we</v>

673
00:29:17.191 --> 00:29:20.850
<v Speaker 2>know of today are the dead sea scrolls </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the dead sea scrolls,</v>

674
00:29:20.851 --> 00:29:25.851
<v Speaker 2>the only bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only version of the bible that's an </v>

675
00:29:25.851 --> 00:29:26.540
<v Speaker 2>aramaic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when they try to translate it,</v>

676
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.770
<v Speaker 2>like if the stories are similar but </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

677
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:33.950
<v Speaker 2>so all sorts of wacky shit in the dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>sea scrolls that isn't in any of the </v>

678
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.911
<v Speaker 2>other books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew the religious texts and then you </v>

679
00:29:37.911 --> 00:29:38.670
<v Speaker 2>go to the oldest versions of the bible </v>
<v Speaker 2>is all in ancient hebrew.</v>

680
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Little fuck speaks ancient hebrew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to translate that to latin </v>

681
00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:47.440
<v Speaker 2>and they translated that to greek and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of shit gets missing in the process.</v>

682
00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:52.730
<v Speaker 2>When they wrote ancient hebrew to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient hebrew letters and numbers were </v>

683
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:54.550
<v Speaker 2>interchangeable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like words had numerical value to them,</v>

684
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:55.780
<v Speaker 2>like there was no number.</v>

685
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.360
<v Speaker 2>So the letter a was also the number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

686
00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:02.830
<v Speaker 2>so it's just such a different context is</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

687
00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:07.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a different meaning to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything they were saying like the </v>

688
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.531
<v Speaker 2>word god and the word love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have the same numerical value and </v>

689
00:30:10.531 --> 00:30:13.090
<v Speaker 2>numerical values are actually important </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the.</v>

690
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.580
<v Speaker 2>When you're saying a sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

691
00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:18.100
<v Speaker 2>you say a sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's tone,</v>

692
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:21.490
<v Speaker 2>there's sarcasm there so you can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in it.</v>

693
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.340
<v Speaker 2>That's why textIng is hard to exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you mad at me like no man,</v>

694
00:30:25.341 --> 00:30:26.120
<v Speaker 2>we were fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

695
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:27.870
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people don't know I'm mad at </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

696
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
<v Speaker 2>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in ancient hebrew apparently it's hard </v>

697
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.430
<v Speaker 2>for us to put it in perspective and kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of understand the way they communicated,</v>

698
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.700
<v Speaker 2>but when they wrote things down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was inherent new miracle quality </v>

699
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.130
<v Speaker 2>to the census.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had lIke a,</v>

700
00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.240
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was worth the sentence,</v>

701
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.620
<v Speaker 2>had numbers to it and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>

702
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:53.670
<v Speaker 2>There are 50 arguments against why the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bible is real and there's one pro </v>

703
00:30:55.931 --> 00:30:59.530
<v Speaker 2>argument which is I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me feel good.</v>

704
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.410
<v Speaker 2>That's the only argument you can give.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

705
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:06.430
<v Speaker 2>the idea that gOd would write one book a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time ago to one dude and then go </v>

706
00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:11.620
<v Speaker 2>off to manage grasshopper populations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and make sure her gains happen.</v>

707
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where have you been man?</v>

708
00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:18.210
<v Speaker 2>How come you don't tell us agaIn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you understand there's 30 </v>

709
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:18.850
<v Speaker 2>different versions of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you want to carry it up?</v>

710
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a dick at this point.</v>

711
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Like if you made a quote like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was a controversial issue that </v>

712
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:25.320
<v Speaker 2>came up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

713
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.580
<v Speaker 2>and you made a quote and then a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people took that quote and butchered it </v>

714
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.860
<v Speaker 2>and twisted it up 15 different ways to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunday and you are aware of it,</v>

715
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:35.860
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you want to correct that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to come back and Go,</v>

716
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:36.170
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

717
00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.640
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see you have to eat babies that</v>

718
00:31:39.641 --> 00:31:40.810
<v Speaker 2>are the color of orange.</v>

719
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:42.580
<v Speaker 2>THat is not what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you guys are.</v>

720
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.540
<v Speaker 2>You guys fucked the whole thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

721
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.350
<v Speaker 2>But not this god guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

722
00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.380
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you.</v>

723
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you.</v>

724
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you once I'm not and I'm not </v>

725
00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:53.660
<v Speaker 2>going to tell you again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did all these people that are lying</v>

726
00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.750
<v Speaker 2>about what you said?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to figure out.</v>

727
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not my problem.</v>

728
00:31:56.231 --> 00:31:57.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not my game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

729
00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:57.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

730
00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>

731
00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:01.570
<v Speaker 2>There's so you believe in a god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't not believe,</v>

732
00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:07.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be super arrogant to </v>

733
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:07.530
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in god.</v>

734
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.810
<v Speaker 2>I've seen so many things on psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs that don't make any sense at all.</v>

735
00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how?</v>

736
00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:16.831
<v Speaker 2>Why would I ever be so cocky as to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have the whole framework of the </v>

737
00:32:16.831 --> 00:32:18.310
<v Speaker 2>universe spelled out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's purely speculation.</v>

738
00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Even for scientists like for scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>and scientists are studying the very </v>

739
00:32:24.011 --> 00:32:29.011
<v Speaker 2>nature of matter itself down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>subatomic particles and quasars and </v>

740
00:32:29.011 --> 00:32:33.430
<v Speaker 2>supernovas and gas clouds and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things that they're studying.</v>

741
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.120
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all they are really,</v>

742
00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 2>truly aware of is what they can perceive</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own senses in this existence.</v>

743
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.850
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what happens when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

744
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.500
<v Speaker 2>They don't know if it's just a gateway </v>
<v Speaker 2>to another new completely different kind</v>

745
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:50.270
<v Speaker 2>of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know,</v>

746
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.110
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that it's not that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just death and it's black and darkness.</v>

747
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:59.290
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where did you come from in the first </v>

748
00:32:59.290 --> 00:32:59.290
<v Speaker 2>place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you even here?</v>

749
00:32:59.290 --> 00:32:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Why are you even here as a conscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>entity?</v>

750
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Like why is the idea of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you thinking about you?</v>

751
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:07.390
<v Speaker 2>that is a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what purpose does it serve and why </v>

752
00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:10.841
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does it exist and is it possible </v>

753
00:33:10.841 --> 00:33:12.410
<v Speaker 2>that this whole thing is just a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

754
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:15.530
<v Speaker 2>sort of like a seed goes into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>

755
00:33:15.531 --> 00:33:20.531
<v Speaker 2>water gets on that seed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this seed sprouts pops through the </v>

756
00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:23.030
<v Speaker 2>ground becomes a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tree gives fruit,</v>

757
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.060
<v Speaker 2>the fruit drops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fruit that fruit goes into the ground,</v>

758
00:33:26.061 --> 00:33:27.230
<v Speaker 2>becomes new trees.</v>

759
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Animals eat those treats or nutrients </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the next generation part of this </v>

760
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:36.251
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy ecosystem and the ecosystem that </v>

761
00:33:36.251 --> 00:33:39.940
<v Speaker 2>has that has created a human being with </v>
<v Speaker 2>all their creativity and self awareness </v>

762
00:33:40.251 --> 00:33:45.251
<v Speaker 2>and all their ability to reflect and </v>
<v Speaker 2>change and this crazy desire for </v>

763
00:33:45.251 --> 00:33:47.030
<v Speaker 2>innovation like to have the newest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest shit.</v>

764
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.620
<v Speaker 2>The biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coolest thing,</v>

765
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.590
<v Speaker 2>the fastest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the smartest thing,</v>

766
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:56.591
<v Speaker 2>the most advanced thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're constantly searching for this </v>

767
00:33:56.591 --> 00:33:56.591
<v Speaker 2>newer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better product.</v>

768
00:33:56.591 --> 00:34:01.360
<v Speaker 2>It would seem to me that all of that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of some almost inescapable </v>

769
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:06.800
<v Speaker 2>process of change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change and improvement and change.</v>

770
00:34:06.801 --> 00:34:09.980
<v Speaker 2>It seems like the whole thing is always </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing,</v>

771
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:15.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a cloud forms or rather a planet </v>

772
00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:19.511
<v Speaker 2>forms out of clouds and dust and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of shit and eventually turns into </v>

773
00:34:19.511 --> 00:34:23.951
<v Speaker 2>a planet eventually acquires water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually has an atmosphere and then </v>

774
00:34:23.951 --> 00:34:28.391
<v Speaker 2>life comes out of it in that life </v>
<v Speaker 2>spreads out into other planets and all </v>

775
00:34:28.391 --> 00:34:32.141
<v Speaker 2>of it seems to be this constant state of</v>
<v Speaker 2>either improvement or death improvement </v>

776
00:34:32.141 --> 00:34:37.031
<v Speaker 2>and death improvement in death and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that it's not building towards </v>

777
00:34:37.031 --> 00:34:37.220
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

778
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:38.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck do you know?</v>

779
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:39.710
<v Speaker 2>How do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

780
00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:44.711
<v Speaker 2>we literally might be building towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>heaven and if human beings with all of </v>

781
00:34:45.201 --> 00:34:48.980
<v Speaker 2>our interest in trans rights and gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights and being progressive,</v>

782
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.340
<v Speaker 2>I really contemplate this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about this all day.</v>

783
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:56.930
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if what we're doing by this </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement that you say what's like,</v>

784
00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.480
<v Speaker 2>some of it's exaggerated and ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some.</v>

785
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Some of the people that are involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it are ultimately really shitty people </v>

786
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.930
<v Speaker 2>that have attached themselves to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting idea,</v>

787
00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:11.140
<v Speaker 2>but the trend seems to be inescapable </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the trend of technological </v>

788
00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.040
<v Speaker 2>innovation as well as a trend of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness.</v>

789
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:14.990
<v Speaker 2>They might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you extrapolate,</v>

790
00:35:14.991 --> 00:35:17.390
<v Speaker 2>you look at where they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a thousand years now,</v>

791
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.350
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years now,</v>

792
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:23.300
<v Speaker 2>it might reach a point of really like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologically created heaven.</v>

793
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:29.080
<v Speaker 2>It is totally possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a technologically creative having </v>

794
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:29.080
<v Speaker 2>created by human beings.</v>

795
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.700
<v Speaker 2>It's created by whatever the fuck fuels </v>
<v Speaker 2>a human being.</v>

796
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.860
<v Speaker 2>We will look at it as us like human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

797
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:35.400
<v Speaker 2>We did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what is the what?</v>

798
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.440
<v Speaker 2>The what is a human being?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a bunch of different </v>

799
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.400
<v Speaker 2>instincts and a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>desires that are sort of sown into the </v>

800
00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.900
<v Speaker 2>existence of being a person and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>unacceptable,</v>

801
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:45.920
<v Speaker 2>inexorable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

802
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.550
<v Speaker 2>you have them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're living in the jungle,</v>

803
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.730
<v Speaker 2>you have them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're living in the city you have.</v>

804
00:35:49.731 --> 00:35:54.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean people just have this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inescapable desire to do a bunch of core</v>

805
00:35:54.781 --> 00:35:55.860
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

806
00:35:55.861 --> 00:36:00.861
<v Speaker 2>maybe those core things are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important and key ingredients towards </v>

807
00:36:00.861 --> 00:36:04.671
<v Speaker 2>creating technology and towards creating</v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness and connection of ideas and </v>

808
00:36:04.671 --> 00:36:08.700
<v Speaker 2>information from entity to entity until </v>
<v Speaker 2>the the entire thing.</v>

809
00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:13.701
<v Speaker 2>Thanks as one to the entire thing thinks</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one and has massive technological </v>

810
00:36:13.701 --> 00:36:18.471
<v Speaker 2>capabilities and literally can escape </v>
<v Speaker 2>the very dimension that is currently </v>

811
00:36:18.471 --> 00:36:20.700
<v Speaker 2>trapped in the dimension that it thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>is all that there is.</v>

812
00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:24.150
<v Speaker 2>This is all that there is because I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>knock on it with my knuckles and I could</v>

813
00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:27.810
<v Speaker 2>put it on a scale and I could run a tape</v>
<v Speaker 2>measure by and tell you exactly how long</v>

814
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:29.730
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what is real,</v>

815
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:35.030
<v Speaker 2>but that's not even what's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's real right now that you </v>

816
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:37.911
<v Speaker 2>can experience and we might be a part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>one continual never ending cycle that </v>

817
00:36:39.361 --> 00:36:42.000
<v Speaker 2>ultimately leads to god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

818
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Possible.</v>

819
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:47.430
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing I don't find to say you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't say I don't believe.</v>

820
00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so either.</v>

821
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:49.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

822
00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:50.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it's arrogant to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

823
00:36:50.881 --> 00:36:51.660
<v Speaker 2>there's no go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>

824
00:36:51.661 --> 00:36:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no good,</v>

825
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.070
<v Speaker 2>but say I don't believe in god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

826
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

827
00:36:55.621 --> 00:36:58.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in god either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't not believe in god.</v>

828
00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>

829
00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:01.350
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

830
00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've met some crazy shit and psychedelic</v>

831
00:37:04.321 --> 00:37:05.580
<v Speaker 2>trips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

832
00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:05.910
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

833
00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I've had a couple of examples if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

834
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm things that knew everything that </v>

835
00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I've ever done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that I've ever said and who I</v>

836
00:37:13.651 --> 00:37:17.400
<v Speaker 2>was exactly down to the core thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean things?</v>

837
00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Entities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're can see right through you now.</v>

838
00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:22.520
<v Speaker 2>What are those entities or this trip or </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

839
00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.100
<v Speaker 2>this is like you meet this guy and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows everything.</v>

840
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Well you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not meeting a guy.</v>

841
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:32.220
<v Speaker 2>You're meeting like a geometric pattern </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is like you can't.</v>

842
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Especially dmt trips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't really isolate what something </v>

843
00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.310
<v Speaker 2>looks like because it only looks like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that for the briefest of moments and </v>

844
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:44.721
<v Speaker 2>then it changes and looks like something</v>
<v Speaker 2>else and it changes and as you think </v>

845
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:48.081
<v Speaker 2>about what it is it alters and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like some bizarre lesson in </v>

846
00:37:48.081 --> 00:37:52.941
<v Speaker 2>perception and the and your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitions of the world around you that</v>

847
00:37:52.981 --> 00:37:54.540
<v Speaker 2>you are in some way.</v>

848
00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:59.570
<v Speaker 2>BY the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you interface with the world changing </v>

849
00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:01.470
<v Speaker 2>the very nature of the world itself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like some weird lesson that they</v>

850
00:38:01.471 --> 00:38:04.410
<v Speaker 2>try to teach you while you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>WhIle you're involved in these trips,</v>

851
00:38:04.411 --> 00:38:06.980
<v Speaker 2>it seems like they're trying to explain </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you there's.</v>

852
00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:11.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not just you have a bad attitude or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just anybody has a bad attitude.</v>

853
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:15.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get tied up in the momentum of those</v>

854
00:38:15.871 --> 00:38:20.871
<v Speaker 2>bad attitudes and the mistakes caused by</v>
<v Speaker 2>those bad attitudes and the energy </v>

855
00:38:20.871 --> 00:38:23.430
<v Speaker 2>that's put out and the ripple effect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that energy and how's it,</v>

856
00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:28.460
<v Speaker 2>how it goes out into the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population and how it comes back to you </v>

857
00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.690
<v Speaker 2>and you get trapped like a goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiderweb and explains it to you.</v>

858
00:38:30.691 --> 00:38:35.691
<v Speaker 2>That literally the way that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>interface with the world changes the </v>

859
00:38:35.691 --> 00:38:36.430
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changes your world,</v>

860
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 2>changes the people that are in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

861
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:43.440
<v Speaker 2>but also changes how those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with other people in the world </v>

862
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.660
<v Speaker 2>as this very freaky fucking bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to have that be told to you by </v>

863
00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:53.130
<v Speaker 2>gestures like giant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like gestures who have like </v>

864
00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:55.310
<v Speaker 2>multidimensional head that's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning around and giving me the finger</v>

865
00:38:55.311 --> 00:38:55.490
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

866
00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:58.780
<v Speaker 2>But I would say that's just your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own consciousness.</v>

867
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.750
<v Speaker 2>It may be that as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may be,</v>

868
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.430
<v Speaker 2>or an entity or a wall or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally possible.</v>

869
00:39:03.431 --> 00:39:05.890
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness really means.</v>

870
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

871
00:39:06.641 --> 00:39:07.330
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

872
00:39:07.331 --> 00:39:12.331
<v Speaker 2>a human being is not an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every human being is a host of an </v>

873
00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:17.460
<v Speaker 2>unknown variable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like literally an uncountable </v>

874
00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.851
<v Speaker 2>number of bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the amount of parasites and the </v>

875
00:39:20.851 --> 00:39:24.100
<v Speaker 2>amount of different bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say there's more cola in a person's</v>

876
00:39:24.101 --> 00:39:26.590
<v Speaker 2>body than there have ever been people </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

877
00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.980
<v Speaker 2>So think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does this what?</v>

878
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Just to just to stop and think about and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need that.</v>

879
00:39:32.951 --> 00:39:35.990
<v Speaker 2>If that's not in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked some shit.</v>

880
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Like the fact that we even know what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>call is like,</v>

881
00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:42.010
<v Speaker 2>science is fucking like the last 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 years.</v>

882
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:43.360
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

883
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

884
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:49.200
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to do even the fuck did you get </v>

885
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.200
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had Brian Cox on the professor who's </v>

886
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.750
<v Speaker 2>brilliant guy who works at cern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who works at the large hadron collider.</v>

887
00:39:55.751 --> 00:39:58.290
<v Speaker 2>And he was trying to explain to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

888
00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:01.240
<v Speaker 2>searching for the hadron in searching </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

889
00:40:01.241 --> 00:40:06.241
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the higgs boson particle and it halfway </v>

890
00:40:06.241 --> 00:40:06.430
<v Speaker 2>into the conversation like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

891
00:40:06.431 --> 00:40:08.650
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you guys find this out?</v>

892
00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Who did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you do?</v>

893
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:16.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just a couple of hundred years </v>

894
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:16.040
<v Speaker 2>away from a guy making fire with steel </v>
<v Speaker 2>and flint.</v>

895
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.440
<v Speaker 2>That's the onlY way they made fire </v>
<v Speaker 2>clink,</v>

896
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.400
<v Speaker 2>clink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clink.</v>

897
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.310
<v Speaker 2>That's how they had to make fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you guys have figured this out.</v>

898
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck,</v>

899
00:40:22.721 --> 00:40:23.710
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

900
00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>

901
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.910
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to believe.</v>

902
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

903
00:40:28.781 --> 00:40:30.330
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard to wrap your head around.</v>

904
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.260
<v Speaker 2>What are they going at with the higgs </v>
<v Speaker 2>boson,</v>

905
00:40:32.261 --> 00:40:33.710
<v Speaker 2>by them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they trying to figure out?</v>

906
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.700
<v Speaker 2>What will that lead to while they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to recreate?</v>

907
00:40:36.701 --> 00:40:41.701
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have apparently recreated the </v>

908
00:40:41.701 --> 00:40:44.431
<v Speaker 2>conditions milliseconds after the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>bang and prove that there is this one </v>

909
00:40:44.431 --> 00:40:48.980
<v Speaker 2>particle that was theoretical up until </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently and they've measured it there </v>

910
00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:53.800
<v Speaker 2>like 99 point nine percent sure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've isolated this particle and </v>

911
00:40:54.281 --> 00:40:56.620
<v Speaker 2>measured it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but along the way they've also,</v>

912
00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:02.670
<v Speaker 2>they've also identified a bunch of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that they weren't sure if it was </v>

913
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:05.440
<v Speaker 2>real or or created some things that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>just theoretical.</v>

914
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:10.710
<v Speaker 2>One is this stuff called clark cork glue</v>
<v Speaker 2>on cork glue on plasma that's insanely </v>

915
00:41:12.731 --> 00:41:17.731
<v Speaker 2>heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if You had a bowling ball full of </v>

916
00:41:17.731 --> 00:41:17.731
<v Speaker 2>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be heavier than the world.</v>

917
00:41:17.731 --> 00:41:22.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they've figured out how to isolate </v>

918
00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:22.630
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also the same sort of thing.</v>

919
00:41:22.631 --> 00:41:25.960
<v Speaker 2>It's something that exists like </v>
<v Speaker 2>milliseconds after the big bang.</v>

920
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:30.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like a part of the very creation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe itself.</v>

921
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.970
<v Speaker 2>So there won't necessarily be like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if this is then</v>

922
00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.240
<v Speaker 4>we'll then all get the floating </v>
<v Speaker 4>skateboard.</v>

923
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.200
<v Speaker 4>You see the floating skateboard </v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday did of unbelievable.</v>

924
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:44.260
<v Speaker 4>But I'll pull up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's funny is how long it took me to </v>

925
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:44.260
<v Speaker 4>get used to it though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

926
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.381
<v Speaker 4>oh good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a floating skateboard and I </v>

927
00:41:47.381 --> 00:41:47.381
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you just go back to your dumb life.</v>

928
00:41:47.381 --> 00:41:48.080
<v Speaker 4>You're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh fuck,</v>

929
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.320
<v Speaker 4>we got to get good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

930
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:53.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll be totally normal.</v>

931
00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:56.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean a car is fucking insane.</v>

932
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:58.910
<v Speaker 4>If you didn't have a car and somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>gave you a car,</v>

933
00:41:58.911 --> 00:42:03.911
<v Speaker 4>is this it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lexus has created a real rideable </v>

934
00:42:03.911 --> 00:42:03.911
<v Speaker 4>hoverboard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

935
00:42:03.911 --> 00:42:08.261
<v Speaker 4>So here's a guy with a skateboard and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets off and he stamps on it says there </v>

936
00:42:10.041 --> 00:42:14.030
<v Speaker 4>is no such thing as impossible and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking.</v>

937
00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:15.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a,</v>

938
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:17.450
<v Speaker 4>that's an after effect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's stupid.</v>

939
00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.610
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it's the best part of this ad.</v>

940
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.820
<v Speaker 4>Put it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy is never going to smoke.</v>

941
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:26.720
<v Speaker 4>It's just a matter of figuring out how.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's going to stand on this now.</v>

942
00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.230
<v Speaker 4>Lexis hoveR the not showing you any more</v>
<v Speaker 4>than that.</v>

947
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:39.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Japanese engineering.</v>

948
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:42.350
<v Speaker 4>It's a little slightly different than </v>
<v Speaker 4>the german engineering.</v>

949
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:44.360
<v Speaker 4>All Of it's pretty fucking bad ass </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

956
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why the rx?</v>

<v Speaker 4>they're fucking amazing.</v>

959
00:42:59.271 --> 00:43:00.710
<v Speaker 4>Driving living room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

961
00:43:02.991 --> 00:43:05.930
<v Speaker 4>It's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Floaty floats down the highway.</v>

962
00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:11.990
<v Speaker 4>They make amazing automobiles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you think about the fact that the </v>

963
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:15.581
<v Speaker 4>automobile has only been around for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little over 100 years to the amount of </v>

964
00:43:15.581 --> 00:43:15.581
<v Speaker 4>innovation that's happened with that.</v>

965
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:18.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's when It's in maths.</v>

966
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:21.590
<v Speaker 4>Even retarded by other industries like </v>
<v Speaker 4>it should be further along.</v>

967
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:27.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think with this tesla shit like this </v>

968
00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.680
<v Speaker 4>elon musk character getting involved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy's making an suv now that's </v>

969
00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.570
<v Speaker 4>going to be an all electric.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's making a two door also.</v>

970
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.900
<v Speaker 4>He's making a bunch of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that bigger thing that he </v>

971
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:37.900
<v Speaker 4>did was he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He like,</v>

972
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.620
<v Speaker 4>he basically gave up all his patents </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

973
00:43:39.621 --> 00:43:43.970
<v Speaker 4>Just let's make it good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's make this an actual thing.</v>

974
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like a real life tOny stark type </v>

975
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:49.000
<v Speaker 4>character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

976
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.130
<v Speaker 4>He's got that new thing for the wall to </v>
<v Speaker 4>new battery system for,</v>

977
00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.610
<v Speaker 4>for solar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For houses.</v>

978
00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:57.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you can't get the thing that I </v>

979
00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:57.620
<v Speaker 4>didn't realize about solar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She can't get.</v>

980
00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:59.300
<v Speaker 4>He can't get it at night unless you </v>
<v Speaker 4>store it.</v>

981
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:00.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>

982
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:02.510
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really hard to store.</v>

983
00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:07.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the time you have these solar </v>

984
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:07.960
<v Speaker 4>rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a,</v>

985
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.070
<v Speaker 4>there was a cabin a that a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mine has in Colorado and she's got these</v>

986
00:44:12.501 --> 00:44:17.501
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like solar batteries hooked up to the </v>

987
00:44:17.501 --> 00:44:18.050
<v Speaker 4>cabin and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a room.</v>

988
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:20.480
<v Speaker 4>Y'all gotta go into the battery rooM,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see what's going on.</v>

989
00:44:20.481 --> 00:44:22.450
<v Speaker 4>And the batteries were dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking awful.</v>

990
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:24.940
<v Speaker 4>But it was a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy who was staying in the cabinet,</v>

991
00:44:24.941 --> 00:44:25.780
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

992
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:27.500
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

995
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:32.910
<v Speaker 4>It just wasn't working correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But with this ian Must thing.</v>

996
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.070
<v Speaker 4>Elon musk's is very small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that big.</v>

997
00:44:36.071 --> 00:44:39.950
<v Speaker 4>It's like a half about this guy and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>half the table.</v>

998
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.470
<v Speaker 4>LIke a small coffee table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.430
<v Speaker 4>And you can put it on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you put it on the wall?</v>

1000
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:44.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1002
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.010
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Power wall.</v>

1003
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:48.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See how it's got.</v>

1004
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.720
<v Speaker 4>It's up there at mounts to the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cool to home battery.</v>

1005
00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:56.721
<v Speaker 4>That charges using electricity generated</v>
<v Speaker 4>from solar panels or when utility rates </v>

1006
00:44:56.721 --> 00:44:57.840
<v Speaker 4>are low and powers your home in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>evening,</v>

1007
00:44:57.841 --> 00:45:01.320
<v Speaker 4>it also fortifies your home against </v>
<v Speaker 4>power outages by providing a backup.</v>

1008
00:45:01.321 --> 00:45:03.670
<v Speaker 4>Electricity supply.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Provable.</v>

1009
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.730
<v Speaker 4>That's goiNg to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a volt.</v>

1010
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:11.240
<v Speaker 4>I was going to get a tesla and I got the</v>
<v Speaker 4>chevy volt because someone pointed out </v>

1011
00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.960
<v Speaker 4>what if there's a power outage?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1012
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.940
<v Speaker 4>That'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1013
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.440
<v Speaker 4>The volt takes both,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1014
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.150
<v Speaker 4>Is that the deal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1015
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.890
<v Speaker 4>the volt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1016
00:45:17.891 --> 00:45:18.980
<v Speaker 4>The volt takes both it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1017
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.150
<v Speaker 4>I can go to gas when the revolution </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes.</v>

1018
00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:22.830
<v Speaker 4>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a smart move right now.</v>

1019
00:45:22.831 --> 00:45:25.410
<v Speaker 4>You've got your feet in both worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little bit of both.</v>

1020
00:45:25.411 --> 00:45:27.900
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you,</v>

1021
00:45:27.901 --> 00:45:30.600
<v Speaker 4>when you put it up with gas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it charge the battery?</v>

1022
00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:36.650
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it basically you get 40 miles of </v>

1023
00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:36.750
<v Speaker 4>electric,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just sure electric.</v>

1024
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:38.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then once you.</v>

1025
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:40.350
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm being honest.</v>

1026
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:45.470
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean not enough?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The average person drives 36 miles a </v>

1027
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:49.671
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what about those extra four miles </v>

1028
00:45:49.671 --> 00:45:49.671
<v Speaker 4>and you'd go to get a sandwich and </v>
<v Speaker 4>throw,</v>

1029
00:45:49.671 --> 00:45:52.920
<v Speaker 4>which is a drip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A gas station were cast out.</v>

1030
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:58.280
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're telling me when the revolution </v>

1031
00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:58.280
<v Speaker 4>comes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1032
00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:58.280
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what to tell you.</v>

1033
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:01.460
<v Speaker 4>You better have a power wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to have one of them yellow.</v>

1034
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:02.580
<v Speaker 4>Elon musk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1035
00:46:02.581 --> 00:46:04.150
<v Speaker 4>But even then it's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although no,</v>

1036
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:08.250
<v Speaker 4>if you have the solar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well solar is only going to work as long</v>

1037
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:10.140
<v Speaker 4>as the fucking weather stays exactly the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same.</v>

1038
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.390
<v Speaker 4>If you have solar and you live in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>place like columbus,</v>

1039
00:46:12.391 --> 00:46:14.310
<v Speaker 4>Ohio in the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good luck.</v>

1040
00:46:14.311 --> 00:46:15.300
<v Speaker 4>Fuck face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1041
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:20.390
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to get much power </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless they develop some sort of new </v>

1042
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.390
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1043
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:21.820
<v Speaker 4>BuT if your skies are gray,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like where I grew up in boston winters,</v>

1044
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.520
<v Speaker 4>all gray,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's gray.</v>

1045
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:26.370
<v Speaker 4>You're not gonna met and put maybe those</v>
<v Speaker 4>new ones actually,</v>

1046
00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:31.770
<v Speaker 4>they're better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got to be getting better with </v>

1047
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:34.190
<v Speaker 4>overcast shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not like being out in the </v>

1048
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.190
<v Speaker 4>desert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>palm springs,</v>

1049
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:35.370
<v Speaker 4>no shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could just power the whole world from</v>

1050
00:46:35.371 --> 00:46:35.850
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1051
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:38.700
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully that'll happen in the next 15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years.</v>

1052
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:43.760
<v Speaker 4>What's amazing when you look at la,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the one resource that we have in </v>

1053
00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.460
<v Speaker 4>abundance is sunshine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is the,</v>

1054
00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:49.600
<v Speaker 4>our research really nothing with it very</v>
<v Speaker 4>little because we don't have to because </v>

1055
00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:53.520
<v Speaker 4>the dwp has a monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you worried about the water?</v>

1056
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.570
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1057
00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:57.030
<v Speaker 4>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How could you not be like,</v>

1058
00:46:57.031 --> 00:46:58.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1059
00:46:58.801 --> 00:47:00.860
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to have much water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1060
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:04.930
<v Speaker 4>that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a new normal thing now.</v>

1061
00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:10.330
<v Speaker 4>Like essentially we're a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're a giant desert city and they're </v>

1062
00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:10.950
<v Speaker 4>going to try actually admitting what </v>
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>

1063
00:47:10.951 --> 00:47:11.940
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1064
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.850
<v Speaker 4>well we're a desert city that had </v>
<v Speaker 4>intermittent rainfall,</v>

1065
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:17.250
<v Speaker 4>intermittent rainfall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reason why la was created in the</v>

1066
00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:22.251
<v Speaker 4>first place as a hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a movie production place was because </v>

1067
00:47:22.251 --> 00:47:23.470
<v Speaker 4>it was so consistent with its winter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the whole meat.</v>

1068
00:47:23.471 --> 00:47:25.860
<v Speaker 4>That means you live in a place that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sucks.</v>

1069
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's great for the sun,</v>

1070
00:47:27.571 --> 00:47:28.040
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1071
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 4>it's not good for life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

1072
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.180
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not supposed to be here.</v>

1073
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1074
00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:34.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not inhabitable unless you do a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of shit,</v>

1075
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.630
<v Speaker 1>unless you'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to reroute the Colorado.</v>

1076
00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:38.470
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1077
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we just just stay near the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado river.</v>

1078
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's interestinG is with climate </v>

1079
00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:49.021
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I'm keeping an eye on </v>

1080
00:47:49.021 --> 00:47:49.021
<v Speaker 1>iS what happens to seattle's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether,</v>

1081
00:47:49.021 --> 00:47:50.650
<v Speaker 1>because I have a buddy who just moved up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to seattle theory about that.</v>

1082
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he fucking said this.</v>

1083
00:47:52.481 --> 00:47:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Winter was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1084
00:47:54.641 --> 00:47:55.990

1086
00:48:00.991 --> 00:48:00.991
<v Speaker 1>brooklyn.</v>

1087
00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:06.180
<v Speaker 1>portland and seattle become la and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vancouver becomes san francisco too.</v>

<v Speaker 1>looks and more worried about.</v>

1112
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I think they're just more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually like care if you're nice </v>

<v Speaker 1>Well their whole culture is just so </v>

1114
00:49:08.281 --> 00:49:11.920
<v Speaker 1>different because it didn't come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>this marauding take over the world.</v>

1115
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.130
<v Speaker 1>sort of a mentality that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>

1116
00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:20.140
<v Speaker 1>as you know in the United States has </v>
<v Speaker 1>this leader of the world go fuck </v>

1117
00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:20.350
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they don't have any of that.</v>

1120
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:30.050
<v Speaker 1>I lot of times I think like the military</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial complex is just because we </v>

1121
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.940
<v Speaker 1>have the bumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1122
00:49:30.941 --> 00:49:32.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got the bumps.</v>

1123
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:36.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like we got the avocados,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gotta make some fucking guacamole,</v>

1124
00:49:36.131 --> 00:49:38.340
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fucking paid for the bumps.</v>

1125
00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:41.350
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking use these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about a cycle.</v>

1126
00:49:41.351 --> 00:49:46.351
<v Speaker 1>That's the cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't not extract that </v>

1127
00:49:46.351 --> 00:49:46.750
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that are making bombs and the</v>

1128
00:49:46.751 --> 00:49:49.360
<v Speaker 1>people that are involved in the and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't not do that.</v>

1129
00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.460
<v Speaker 1>If they see that they're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>

1130
00:49:51.461 --> 00:49:53.390
<v Speaker 1>it's too much money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to stop asking.</v>

1131
00:49:53.391 --> 00:49:54.520
<v Speaker 1>We just have to stop giving it to them.</v>

1132
00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:57.940
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of the thing of like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1133
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.890
<v Speaker 1>the thing of light lost jobs because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1134
00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:04.960
<v Speaker 1>that's not an argument to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lost jobs from the military industrial </v>

1135
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:05.760
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we ain't got away.</v>

1136
00:50:05.761 --> 00:50:06.460
<v Speaker 1>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1137
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I got 8,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in my district and all that shit.</v>

1138
00:50:08.891 --> 00:50:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1139
00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:11.530
<v Speaker 1>fucking having to do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with coal.</v>

1140
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.600
<v Speaker 1>They say that about coal industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said about horseshoes.</v>

1141
00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1142
00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely.</v>

1143
00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1144
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:18.770
<v Speaker 1>what about the blacksmiths?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1145
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:23.500
<v Speaker 1>He put in a lot of black students at </v>
<v Speaker 1>your fancy fucking fancy car.</v>

1146
00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing is when computers</v>

1147
00:50:25.781 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 1>and robots take over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there</v>

1148
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:33.070
<v Speaker 4>will be blue collar people breaking into</v>
<v Speaker 4>factories to beat up the robots.</v>

1149
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:40.160
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really go in the sledge hammers and</v>

1150
00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:43.040
<v Speaker 4>they'll start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I believe is the,</v>

1151
00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:46.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the definition of a,</v>

1152
00:50:46.611 --> 00:50:51.611
<v Speaker 4>a what a luddite is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are people that were so anti.</v>

1153
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:54.860
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Robot that they beat them up.</v>

1154
00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:56.360
<v Speaker 4>They beat machines up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1155
00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:01.440
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was so fucking wrong.</v>

1156
00:51:01.671 --> 00:51:02.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not wrong.</v>

1157
00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:03.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

1158
00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.970
<v Speaker 4>that was like during the industrial age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1159
00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.240
<v Speaker 4>Look at this member of any bands of </v>
<v Speaker 4>english workers who destroyed machinery,</v>

1160
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:13.390
<v Speaker 4>especially in cotton and woolen mills </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they believe with threatening their </v>

1161
00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:14.840
<v Speaker 4>jobs in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>11 to 18,</v>

1162
00:51:14.841 --> 00:51:16.040
<v Speaker 4>60.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That will be,</v>

1163
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:20.330
<v Speaker 4>that will be a he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that will be a huge thing.</v>

1164
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:22.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like.</v>

1165
00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.330
<v Speaker 4>But stan hopes you ever hear stainless </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit about like should,</v>

1166
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.090
<v Speaker 4>where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1167
00:51:26.091 --> 00:51:28.190
<v Speaker 4>it's only a five percent unemployment.</v>

1168
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:33.220
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't we be going for hundred </v>

1169
00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:33.710
<v Speaker 4>percent unemployment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like don't we all just not want to work?</v>

1170
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:38.740
<v Speaker 4>Like why are we going toward this </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking dumb work thing when we could </v>

1171
00:51:38.871 --> 00:51:40.700
<v Speaker 4>just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we all figure it out?</v>

1172
00:51:40.701 --> 00:51:45.701
<v Speaker 4>So we'd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>none of us have to work because people </v>

1173
00:51:45.701 --> 00:51:48.311
<v Speaker 4>have associated working with making </v>
<v Speaker 4>money and making money with staying </v>

1174
00:51:48.311 --> 00:51:52.121
<v Speaker 4>alive and the only way you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>contribute as if you work and the only </v>

1175
00:51:52.121 --> 00:51:53.870
<v Speaker 4>way you can get money to stay alive as </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were in this.</v>

1176
00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:55.250
<v Speaker 4>The one thing that everybody's worried </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

1177
00:51:55.251 --> 00:51:56.720
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's worried about not being able</v>

1178
00:51:56.721 --> 00:51:59.000
<v Speaker 4>to pay their bills and starving to </v>
<v Speaker 4>death.</v>

1179
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:04.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>HavIng their children go hungry and </v>

1180
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.030
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

1181
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:05.951
<v Speaker 4>what if we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if we live like the places that we </v>

1182
00:52:05.951 --> 00:52:08.471
<v Speaker 4>know exist all over the world and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>place is all over the world where </v>

1183
00:52:08.471 --> 00:52:08.471
<v Speaker 4>children go hungry.</v>

1184
00:52:08.471 --> 00:52:13.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also that protestant work ethic </v>

1185
00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:13.060
<v Speaker 4>thing where it's like it's next to </v>
<v Speaker 4>godliness.</v>

1186
00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:16.010
<v Speaker 4>It becomes one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two gods smiled.</v>

1187
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.840
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when the man work,</v>

1188
00:52:17.841 --> 00:52:22.841
<v Speaker 4>like that's a huge tenant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well don't you think that that's one of </v>

1189
00:52:22.841 --> 00:52:22.940
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those tenants that those existed because</v>

1190
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:27.970
<v Speaker 4>they were trying to instill this idea of</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to stay alive and so it's good </v>

1191
00:52:28.371 --> 00:52:29.360
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to work hard.</v>

1192
00:52:29.361 --> 00:52:32.120
<v Speaker 4>It's nobody wants to fucking farm and </v>
<v Speaker 4>plow the fields,</v>

1193
00:52:32.121 --> 00:52:34.550
<v Speaker 4>but if you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all going to fucking star,</v>

1194
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.240
<v Speaker 4>so let's make it a religious ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's make it a super important thing to</v>

1195
00:52:38.241 --> 00:52:40.900
<v Speaker 4>god really likes and when you plow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>god loves it.</v>

1196
00:52:40.901 --> 00:52:42.410
<v Speaker 4>When you plant seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sow the seed.</v>

1197
00:52:42.411 --> 00:52:43.330
<v Speaker 4>Go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1198
00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:46.310
<v Speaker 4>I'd loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it even possible to have,</v>

1199
00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:49.010
<v Speaker 4>would that be possible to have it 100 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent unemployment?</v>

1200
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.780
<v Speaker 4>You know like could society.</v>

1201
00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:54.160
<v Speaker 4>Society is based on bartering and </v>
<v Speaker 4>trading and.</v>

1202
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:59.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's also work that people like </v>

1203
00:52:59.240 --> 00:52:59.240
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about that?</v>

1204
00:52:59.240 --> 00:52:59.640
<v Speaker 4>What if you're a dentist and you enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing dentistry?</v>

1205
00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:03.380
<v Speaker 4>You want 100 percent employment </v>
<v Speaker 4>placement and I have all these clients.</v>

1206
00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:05.870
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy fixing their teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the fucking robots,</v>

1207
00:53:05.871 --> 00:53:07.220
<v Speaker 4>bro?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to school for it.</v>

1208
00:53:07.221 --> 00:53:08.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got robots though,</v>

1209
00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:13.910
<v Speaker 4>but you didn't go to school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you didn't go to school.</v>

1210
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.900
<v Speaker 4>You didn't have people that are car </v>
<v Speaker 4>enthusiasts that fix cars.</v>

1211
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:21.500
<v Speaker 4>What about people that make clothes that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are really into designing clothes?</v>

1212
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:26.870
<v Speaker 4>I you still do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that you have to do it to </v>

1213
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.870
<v Speaker 4>survive,</v>

1214
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:28.530
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just an intro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't disagree with them.</v>

1215
00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that you'd want someone in this </v>

1216
00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:34.110
<v Speaker 3>robot's someone would have to make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>robots.</v>

1217
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:35.460
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's work,</v>

1218
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.880
<v Speaker 3>but at some point someone's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to work in the robots.</v>

1219
00:53:38.881 --> 00:53:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Even if there's robots making robots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone has to serve as the superhero.</v>

1220
00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:47.940
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like so someone's going to have to work </v>

1221
00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:50.810
<v Speaker 3>and then that guy is going to want shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the work he did and then it just </v>

1222
00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:50.810
<v Speaker 3>becomes a bartering society.</v>

1223
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:54.150
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like it's ever possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to 100 percent,</v>

1224
00:53:54.151 --> 00:53:57.000
<v Speaker 2>but you might be able to get down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 10 percent plus robots.</v>

1225
00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:00.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get down to 10 percent working 90</v>

1226
00:54:00.361 --> 00:54:05.361
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an imposing sentence by blank </v>

1227
00:54:05.361 --> 00:54:05.361
<v Speaker 2>blank plus robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:54:05.361 --> 00:54:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Because once you've got robots in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mix,</v>

1229
00:54:05.881 --> 00:54:10.881
<v Speaker 2>everything changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need a whole lot of people to </v>

1230
00:54:10.881 --> 00:54:13.161
<v Speaker 2>run the robot because you get robots </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fix robots and the robots to fix </v>

1231
00:54:13.161 --> 00:54:13.620
<v Speaker 2>the robot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix the robots.</v>

1232
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Who watches the watch with water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is robots.</v>

1233
00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:22.821
<v Speaker 2>The robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you would have to make sure that </v>

1234
00:54:22.821 --> 00:54:24.170
<v Speaker 2>also that the people that did do all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>work were they,</v>

1235
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:29.180
<v Speaker 2>that you kept a steady supply of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and kept them educated because if you </v>

1236
00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.010
<v Speaker 2>didn't and then we ran out of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that knew how to fix the robots and then</v>

1237
00:54:32.011 --> 00:54:34.680
<v Speaker 2>we're just scrambling like we have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>relearn how to fix robots.</v>

1238
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:40.230
<v Speaker 3>There was a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a white noise,</v>

1239
00:54:40.231 --> 00:54:41.730
<v Speaker 3>don delillo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it talked about like,</v>

1240
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.750
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't fucking fix a clock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't fix it.</v>

1241
00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.870
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't fix the light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't fix any if something.</v>

1242
00:54:48.871 --> 00:54:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Like if I was the last guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I couldn't fix shit at all.</v>

1243
00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:58.440
<v Speaker 2>We know how to hold bit about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about dumb people like not realizing </v>

1244
00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:03.351
<v Speaker 2>they're dumb because they buy a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart things that other people figured </v>

1245
00:55:03.351 --> 00:55:06.291
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>then one day the power goes out and I'm </v>

1246
00:55:06.291 --> 00:55:06.291
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do when the power goes out?</v>

1247
00:55:06.291 --> 00:55:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I usually do is I sit around and </v>

1248
00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:09.920
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured someone's fixing that shit.</v>

1249
00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Then that person is that person's dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one would know what happened to.</v>

1250
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

1251
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:20.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that job was if I left you </v>

1252
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:21.771
<v Speaker 2>alone alone in the woods with a hatchet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long before you could send me an </v>

1253
00:55:21.771 --> 00:55:21.771
<v Speaker 2>email like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1254
00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:26.930
<v Speaker 2>how long would it take?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows how to make a fucking </v>

1255
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:26.930
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows how to build an engine.</v>

1256
00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:29.580
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows how to forge metal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull it,</v>

1257
00:55:29.581 --> 00:55:32.420
<v Speaker 2>pull it out of the ground and turn into </v>
<v Speaker 2>a cash buyer.</v>

1258
00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:34.020
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>

1259
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:36.570
<v Speaker 2>I meAn I would literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I started a fire,</v>

1260
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:39.450
<v Speaker 2>it would be based on shit I saw on </v>
<v Speaker 2>survivor.</v>

1261
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I swear to god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I could start a fire if I have </v>

1262
00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:48.231
<v Speaker 2>the right stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to make sure you have the </v>

1263
00:55:48.231 --> 00:55:49.440
<v Speaker 2>right stuff and it wouldn't be easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy at all.</v>

1264
00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd have to have rope and a stick</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stick.</v>

1265
00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that sort of thing that they do.</v>

1266
00:55:56.910 --> 00:56:00.740
<v Speaker 3>It becomes a bow and then like it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when to like</v>

1267
00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.290
<v Speaker 2>yo go over to the thing to the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1268
00:56:03.291 --> 00:56:04.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy on,</v>

1269
00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:05.360
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1270
00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:10.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a show called life below zero </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this fucking dude doesn't bring </v>

1271
00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:12.030
<v Speaker 2>matches with him because he doesn't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to rely on matches because what if I,</v>

1272
00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:13.510
<v Speaker 2>what if I run out of matches?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1273
00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:14.760
<v Speaker 2>I would if I rely on live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

1274
00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:17.530
<v Speaker 2>his mouthpiece thAt he puts in and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a stick,</v>

1275
00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:19.300
<v Speaker 2>put cv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a video of it.</v>

1276
00:56:19.301 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 2>His name is glenn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull up glenn from life below zero,</v>

1277
00:56:24.071 --> 00:56:27.130
<v Speaker 2>makes a fire on youtube and he puts this</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>

1278
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:31.990
<v Speaker 2>is this piece in his mouth and the piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>like clamps down on the top of the stick</v>

1279
00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:35.560
<v Speaker 2>so that he could use the bow with two </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands and really get a lot of friction.</v>

1280
00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:40.600
<v Speaker 2>so you as the bow that's wrapped around </v>
<v Speaker 2>those string of the bose wrapped around </v>

1281
00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.470
<v Speaker 2>the stick and he's going right to left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to left,</v>

1282
00:56:41.471 --> 00:56:42.400
<v Speaker 2>right to left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to left.</v>

1283
00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:44.710
<v Speaker 2>And as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it spins,</v>

1284
00:56:44.711 --> 00:56:49.711
<v Speaker 2>the friction starts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see little smoke and he's pushing like </v>

1285
00:56:49.711 --> 00:56:52.770
<v Speaker 2>dry can tinder in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he gets like a little ball of </v>

1286
00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:54.900
<v Speaker 2>fire and then he builds it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long have you see it?</v>

1287
00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.520
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1288
00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:58.750
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make too much to carry around</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your mouth,</v>

1289
00:56:59.070 --> 00:56:59.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1290
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:01.090
<v Speaker 2>It has to be online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's not online,</v>

1291
00:57:01.091 --> 00:57:02.680
<v Speaker 2>they should be fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

1292
00:57:02.681 --> 00:57:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy,</v>

1293
00:57:03.881 --> 00:57:05.290
<v Speaker 2>this is how he does it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give it some,</v>

1294
00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:06.790
<v Speaker 2>some volume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll see.</v>

1295
00:57:06.791 --> 00:57:09.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't use a headlamp because what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens if I run out of headlamps?</v>

1296
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:11.500
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 40 below zero waste.</v>

1297
00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Filming what this mouthpiece is made out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of caribou.</v>

1298
00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:20.220
<v Speaker 2>This guy's supported living so gangster </v>
<v Speaker 2>up there.</v>

1299
00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:23.190
<v Speaker 2>So he holds his caribou antler piece in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his mouth.</v>

1300
00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Then he wraps a string around his </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucker.</v>

1301
00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Watch how he does this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is pretty wild.</v>

1302
00:57:31.930 --> 00:57:33.560
<v Speaker 2>So he's pulling right left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1303
00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:34.140
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1304
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.000
<v Speaker 2>And watch how quick it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1305
00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that nuts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1306
00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:44.470
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he has this fire starting thing.</v>

1307
00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Any reuse it over and over again because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more he does it,</v>

1308
00:57:47.541 --> 00:57:50.000
<v Speaker 2>his teeth are ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should point out yes.</v>

1309
00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Either fart bite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not caribou antlers.</v>

1310
00:57:52.241 --> 00:57:57.241
<v Speaker 2>Bitch was trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then he reuses that the little </v>

1311
00:57:57.281 --> 00:58:00.400
<v Speaker 2>thin plate of wood that he has </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath it.</v>

1312
00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Reuse that over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of blAck and charred,</v>

1313
00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.550
<v Speaker 2>which makes it a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>flammable.</v>

1314
00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:07.510
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was never suicidal.</v>

1398
01:01:41.271 --> 01:01:43.870
<v Speaker 4>It was never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just like kind of a,</v>

1399
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:48.940
<v Speaker 4>like the best I could feel what I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel his adrenaline and ego,</v>

1400
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:53.150
<v Speaker 4>do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was never like joy,</v>

1401
01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.100
<v Speaker 4>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of,</v>

1402
01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:59.840

<v Speaker 4>It just didN't happen.</v>

1404
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.910
<v Speaker 4>No joy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no happiness.</v>

1405
01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:06.200
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1406
01:02:06.201 --> 01:02:08.680
<v Speaker 4>not but not miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1407
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:13.690

<v Speaker 4>while this is going on and great things </v>

1408
01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:13.690

1411
01:02:15.501 --> 01:02:16.430
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

1412
01:02:16.431 --> 01:02:18.410
<v Speaker 4>the greatest sketch comedy the world's </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever known.</v>

1413
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:19.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that was a great thing.</v>

1414
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:21.000

<v Speaker 4>was there joy?</v>

1416

<v Speaker 3>adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was never.</v>

1418
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.770
<v Speaker 3>It never felt like my brain would like </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk me out of it.</v>

1419
01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:41.460

01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:51.850
<v Speaker 3>but after awhile it just stopped </v>
<v Speaker 3>working.</v>

1495
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Now when it stopped working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I or when I would try to go off it,</v>

1496
01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:01.920
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would get like a tension in my.</v>

1497
01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:07.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fucking temple that literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't like a knot in my template.</v>

1498
01:06:09.051 --> 01:06:12.340
<v Speaker 3>Like if you needed to get massaged it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would just form.</v>

1499
01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:17.850
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I knew like oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking depressed again because it </v>

1500
01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:17.850
<v Speaker 3>would just form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1501
01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.140
<v Speaker 2>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>

1502
01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:22.140
<v Speaker 2>when you said it wasn't working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was the shift?</v>

1503
01:06:22.141 --> 01:06:24.120
<v Speaker 2>It starteD working in beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

1504
01:06:24.121 --> 01:06:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1505
01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.830
<v Speaker 3>there is a term for it and I always </v>
<v Speaker 3>forget it,</v>

1506
01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.750
<v Speaker 3>but it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just stopped.</v>

1507
01:06:29.751 --> 01:06:32.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like an efficacy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>longterm efficacy.</v>

1508
01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:32.830
<v Speaker 3>Just</v>

1509
01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:34.720
<v Speaker 2>tampers decreases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1510
01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:37.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's specific to zoloft.</v>

1511
01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.600
<v Speaker 3>It's all them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>

1512
01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.800
<v Speaker 3>It can be all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1513
01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:46.180
<v Speaker 3>so then I switched to a I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then probably the last four or five </v>

1514
01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.180
<v Speaker 3>years I've switched a bunch because all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones I tried had some side effect.</v>

1515
01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:53.660
<v Speaker 2>What is the feeling though that you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>on them?</v>

1516
01:06:53.661 --> 01:06:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Is it like a feeling of you have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>more energy?</v>

1517
01:06:57.501 --> 01:06:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a little more enthusiasm?</v>

1518
01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:03.730
<v Speaker 3>You have more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have like more generosity of spirit,</v>

1519
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:04.850
<v Speaker 3>if that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1520
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:08.710
<v Speaker 3>just like you want your less of like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hater.</v>

1521
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.420
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1522
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:14.560
<v Speaker 3>because you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't feel so depleted yourself that</v>

1523
01:07:14.561 --> 01:07:15.530
<v Speaker 3>you can actually be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1524
01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:17.230
<v Speaker 3>that's good man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking awesome.</v>

1525
01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.220
<v Speaker 2>What's hard for people to be happy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people?</v>

1526
01:07:19.221 --> 01:07:24.221
<v Speaker 2>If they're not happy about 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard because no one's mean </v>

1527
01:07:24.221 --> 01:07:24.680
<v Speaker 2>because they're in a good mood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1528
01:07:24.681 --> 01:07:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Like other people don't deserve </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness.</v>

1529
01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.200
<v Speaker 2>You can't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1530
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck did you get it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1531
01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:33.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's like any troll.</v>

1532
01:07:33.111 --> 01:07:35.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like you just see it's because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're unhappy man.</v>

1533
01:07:35.001 --> 01:07:40.001
<v Speaker 3>It's like I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just don't take my success isn't your </v>

1534
01:07:40.001 --> 01:07:43.901
<v Speaker 3>failure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's how it feels because you </v>

1535
01:07:43.901 --> 01:07:43.901
<v Speaker 3>can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even get.</v>

1536
01:07:43.901 --> 01:07:45.510
<v Speaker 3>Not can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only can you not do standard,</v>

1537
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.940
<v Speaker 3>whatever the thing they're mad at you </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1538
01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.970
<v Speaker 3>they can't even feel what they imagine </v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel from doing it.</v>

1539
01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:51.860
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1540
01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:57.310
<v Speaker 3>so I tried a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last four or five years they would </v>

1541
01:07:57.310 --> 01:07:57.710
<v Speaker 3>work with are some side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nausea,</v>

1542
01:07:58.290 --> 01:08:03.290
<v Speaker 3>a one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like gaining weight and I wasn't </v>

1543
01:08:03.290 --> 01:08:03.290
<v Speaker 3>eating and I was gaining weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1544
01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so weird.</v>

1545
01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:09.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm a shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the last one was um,</v>

1546
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:15.020
<v Speaker 3>nausea and my dick was in a coma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1547
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:20.080
<v Speaker 3>like literally I took a fucking pro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the boner drug and um,</v>

1548
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:22.620
<v Speaker 3>agora.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1549
01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:24.530
<v Speaker 3>it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1550
01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:26.480
<v Speaker 3>generally how fucking like</v>

1551
01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.870
<v Speaker 4>dan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like literally,</v>

1552
01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:32.240
<v Speaker 4>it's like put the bucket and chart what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fucking clear.</v>

1553
01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:34.530
<v Speaker 4>Clear back nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1554
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:37.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you had to get off that immediately.</v>

1555
01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the.</v>

1556
01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:39.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so important.</v>

1557
01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:42.540
<v Speaker 4>Happiness or boners?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1558
01:08:42.541 --> 01:08:44.070
<v Speaker 4>what was interesting is it was,</v>

1559
01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:49.170
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was interesting for the few months </v>

1560
01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:51.430
<v Speaker 3>that I had it to not have to worry aBout</v>
<v Speaker 3>boners boners are pursuing,</v>

1561
01:08:51.431 --> 01:08:55.000
<v Speaker 3>girls are fucking texting and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1562
01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:57.820
<v Speaker 3>and tendering and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like I don't give a shit.</v>

1563
01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:01.880
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now when they seem like nice people,</v>

1564
01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:06.050
<v Speaker 4>now what does it do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it,</v>

1565
01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.840
<v Speaker 4>does it somehow another deplete your </v>
<v Speaker 4>testosterone?</v>

1566
01:09:08.841 --> 01:09:10.550
<v Speaker 4>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why that.</v>

1567
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:11.870
<v Speaker 4>The thing about antidepressants,</v>

1568
01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:15.750
<v Speaker 3>they don't know why they work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know that they work.</v>

1569
01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:19.080
<v Speaker 3>They have theories about why they work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the.</v>

1570
01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:22.650
<v Speaker 3>I was on a class of antidepressants </v>
<v Speaker 3>called ssrs,</v>

1571
01:09:22.651 --> 01:09:26.940
<v Speaker 3>which are short for a selective </v>
<v Speaker 3>serotonin reuptake inhibitor,</v>

1572
01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:30.420
<v Speaker 3>which means it's basically a double </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative,</v>

1573
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:34.500
<v Speaker 3>a re uptake inhibitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's basically when you,</v>

1574
01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:37.290
<v Speaker 3>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the serotonin goes out,</v>

1575
01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.420
<v Speaker 3>usually it gets collected quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you take this drug,</v>

1576
01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:44.970
<v Speaker 3>it leaves the serotonin out in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain longer.</v>

1577
01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:47.960
<v Speaker 3>I believe sarah re uptake inhibitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1578
01:09:47.961 --> 01:09:50.970
<v Speaker 3>So it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it inhibits the uptake so it like,</v>

1579
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:51.870
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay out.</v>

1580
01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>run around a little bit,</v>

1581
01:09:53.401 --> 01:09:54.480
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saratoga.</v>

1582
01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:56.910
<v Speaker 3>So if you take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take the drug,</v>

1583
01:09:56.911 --> 01:10:01.911
<v Speaker 3>I think if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't take the drug it would be a,</v>

1584
01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it was my brain would collect it</v>

1585
01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:07.380
<v Speaker 3>super quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm of the mind that I don't have enough</v>

1586
01:10:07.381 --> 01:10:09.060
<v Speaker 3>serotonin to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I just have,</v>

1587
01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.940
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I have a serotonin </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficiency naturally,</v>

1588
01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:14.280
<v Speaker 3>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So uh,</v>

1589
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:19.310
<v Speaker 3>so I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my dick was in a coma and I was </v>

1590
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:21.290
<v Speaker 3>throwing up like pretty regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how often?</v>

1591
01:10:21.291 --> 01:10:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Like three Days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1592
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:25.890
<v Speaker 3>I just be driving and go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1593
01:10:25.891 --> 01:10:30.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to throw up and throw up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then be fine.</v>

1594
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:36.110
<v Speaker 4>So essentially what these drugs you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to somehow or another reengineer </v>

1595
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:38.580
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your neuro chemical makeup?</v>

1596
01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1597
01:10:40.071 --> 01:10:41.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're trying to help it </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>

1598
01:10:41.931 --> 01:10:45.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can reengineer it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get to the reengineering,</v>

1599
01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:48.440
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think with the drugs you just go like,</v>

1600
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:51.320
<v Speaker 3>it's basically a bandaid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just like,</v>

1601
01:10:51.321 --> 01:10:52.820
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reroute ain't go over there.</v>

1602
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.080
<v Speaker 3>It's never like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking synapses are in different</v>

1603
01:10:57.081 --> 01:10:57.740
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1604
01:10:57.741 --> 01:10:58.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1605
01:10:58.150 --> 01:11:01.910
<v Speaker 4>but it's amazing that they're doing this</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're not exactly sure as you say,</v>

1606
01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.460
<v Speaker 4>how they work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1607
01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:04.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

1608
01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.730
<v Speaker 3>They really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have theory.</v>

1609
01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Obviously they know that ssrs radio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they selectively,</v>

<v Speaker 3>up to the whatever fucking.</v>

1611

<v Speaker 3>But they don't know exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't even know if,</v>

1612
01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.790
<v Speaker 3>if it'S in your brain or if it's in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>stomach,</v>

1613
01:11:23.791 --> 01:11:26.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an article in the atlantic two</v>

1614
01:11:26.011 --> 01:11:29.160
<v Speaker 3>days ago that's saying a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1615
01:11:29.161 --> 01:11:32.130
<v Speaker 3>you're all of like all those chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about,</v>

1616
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.590
<v Speaker 3>lIke sarah tunnel and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly in your stomach.</v>

1617
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which people don't know.</v>

1618
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they are basically saying like,</v>

1619
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:41.580
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1620
01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:46.660
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're lookIng in people's feces and </v>

1621
01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:50.390
<v Speaker 3>they think that the amount of chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 3>or combinations you have in your </v>

1622
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.390
<v Speaker 3>stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can affect mood.</v>

1623
01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:51.560
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1624
01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:56.800
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what the concept behind </v>

1625
01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:56.800
<v Speaker 4>probiotics affecting the mood are 100 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent.</v>

1626
01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.480
<v Speaker 4>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was getting a bunch of colds and I </v>

1627
01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.850
<v Speaker 4>started taking probiotics and haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>got one to die harm.</v>

1628
01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.610
<v Speaker 4>I almost never get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1629
01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:06.550
<v Speaker 4>I drink kombucha everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1630
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.780
<v Speaker 4>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gts kombucha,</v>

1631
01:12:08.781 --> 01:12:12.950
<v Speaker 4>the kind that you have to have an id to </v>
<v Speaker 4>show because it is moRe than one half of</v>

1632
01:12:12.951 --> 01:12:14.660
<v Speaker 4>one percent of our.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all it is.</v>

1633
01:12:14.661 --> 01:12:15.350
<v Speaker 4>A tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tiny.</v>

1634
01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.790
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to drInk like 30 of them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>catch the bus you'd get from one beer,</v>

1635
01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:21.910
<v Speaker 4>but it's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1636
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:24.130
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1637
01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.700
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a stupid law,</v>

1638
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:30.850
<v Speaker 4>but the probiotic effect of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fermentation of this live cultures,</v>

1639
01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:31.980
<v Speaker 4>it's causing the alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1640
01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:33.560
<v Speaker 4>But it's so good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1641
01:12:33.561 --> 01:12:35.420
<v Speaker 4>YeAh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been crazy.</v>

1642
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:37.280
<v Speaker 4>Changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like traveling.</v>

1643
01:12:37.281 --> 01:12:38.030
<v Speaker 4>you should make me sick.</v>

1644
01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:40.010
<v Speaker 4>It was always getting sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get sick anymore.</v>

1645
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:42.800
<v Speaker 4>If I do get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very quick in and out.</v>

1646
01:12:42.801 --> 01:12:43.910
<v Speaker 4>So quick turnaround.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1647
01:12:43.911 --> 01:12:46.720
<v Speaker 4>I would highly recommend it because if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're traveling all the time on a,</v>

1648
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:49.730
<v Speaker 4>as a comIc on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your immune system takes a fucking.</v>

1649
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:52.160
<v Speaker 4>Even in firstclass gel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>

1650
01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:56.570
<v Speaker 4>Even first class I wrote coach the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>day for the first time in a long time,</v>

1651
01:12:57.650 --> 01:12:59.230
<v Speaker 4>people were touching me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting there,</v>

1652
01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:04.240
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are you touchIng your leg is </v>

1653
01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:04.240
<v Speaker 4>touching my leg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever you get.</v>

1654
01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:04.580
<v Speaker 4>It's obviously something comforting </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>

1655
01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.430
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's touching each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's sitting there and you're,</v>

1656
01:13:07.431 --> 01:13:12.431
<v Speaker 4>you know that your arm's gonna touch the</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy next to you and everybody accepts </v>

1657
01:13:12.431 --> 01:13:12.431
<v Speaker 4>that we're all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the world we're living in.</v>

1658
01:13:12.431 --> 01:13:13.670
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1659
01:13:13.671 --> 01:13:18.671
<v Speaker 4>why is that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as everyone's arm is touching </v>

1660
01:13:18.671 --> 01:13:18.671
<v Speaker 4>everyone.</v>

1661
01:13:18.671 --> 01:13:18.671
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm cool.</v>

1662
01:13:18.671 --> 01:13:20.120
<v Speaker 4>And as long as no one gets greedy with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1663
01:13:20.121 --> 01:13:22.670
<v Speaker 4>as long as everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>friendly with the space,</v>

1664
01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:27.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't man spread and bop into the </v>

1665
01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:30.530
<v Speaker 4>other guy's side and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also hygiene,</v>

1666
01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:35.710
<v Speaker 4>that's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's huge because if you touch them </v>

1667
01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:35.710
<v Speaker 4>people and they stink,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking brutal.</v>

1668
01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:39.350
<v Speaker 4>And I've had that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long the flight was two flights.</v>

1669
01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:41.390
<v Speaker 4>What happened was I'm to vegas or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1670
01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:42.530
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was to Canada.</v>

1671
01:13:42.531 --> 01:13:45.880
<v Speaker 4>I fucked up and I'm so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>just donor move.</v>

1672
01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:50.960
<v Speaker 4>My flight takes off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took off at a certain time.</v>

1673
01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.470
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had it written the time I was supposed</v>

1674
01:13:54.471 --> 01:13:56.340
<v Speaker 4>to get up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1675
01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.400
<v Speaker 4>had reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So instead of thinking that I was </v>

1676
01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:04.380
<v Speaker 4>supposed to get up at 9:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>flight,</v>

1677
01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.530
<v Speaker 4>the flight was at 9:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

1678
01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.530
<v Speaker 4>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I thought the flight was at like 11</v>

1679
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 4>and I got there in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

1680
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.060
<v Speaker 3>you should just go based on what time of</v>
<v Speaker 3>flight leaves.</v>

1681
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:18.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't leave it up to the airline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what time you should wake up,</v>

1682
01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:24.520
<v Speaker 2>what was just such a boneheaded move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had too many different things </v>

1683
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.850
<v Speaker 2>going on and I wrote it down somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just incorrectly wrote it down.</v>

1684
01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1685
01:14:28.291 --> 01:14:30.120
<v Speaker 2>point being I had to switch the flights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah blah.</v>

1686
01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:35.180
<v Speaker 2>And I was thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kinda like the only time where </v>

1687
01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:35.760
<v Speaker 2>people ever touched people that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know except jujitsu class maybe,</v>

1688
01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:37.740
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you try to kill each other.</v>

1689
01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.260
<v Speaker 2>Mass transit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass transit.</v>

1690
01:14:40.261 --> 01:14:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Especially like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tokyo,</v>

1691
01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.680
<v Speaker 2>tokyo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather that they push people in.</v>

1692
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000
<v Speaker 2>They literally have guys whose jobs are </v>
<v Speaker 2>to shove people deeper and deeper into </v>

1693
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:49.290
<v Speaker 2>those boxes.</v>

1694
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're made,</v>

1695
01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:53.270
<v Speaker 3>they make six figures doing that.</v>

1696
01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:56.940
<v Speaker 2>People get depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people get depressed from a lack of</v>

1697
01:14:56.941 --> 01:14:57.900
<v Speaker 2>human contact.</v>

1698
01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.580
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get to that in a second.</v>

1699
01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:02.410
<v Speaker 3>UM,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

1700
01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:07.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was just like taking like the last </v>

1701
01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:07.620
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1702
01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:10.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sick of fucking taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] the thing with </v>

1703
01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:14.040
<v Speaker 3>antidepressant pills is that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a complete guessing it what's gonna</v>

1704
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:20.310
<v Speaker 3>work for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the one I was taking that was </v>

1705
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:22.210
<v Speaker 3>making my dick fall asleep and make me </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw up was supposed to have the lowest</v>

1706
01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:25.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>side effect profile of all of them.</v>

1707
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:30.870
<v Speaker 3>But I've had ones that had more that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were supposed to do worship shit and </v>

1708
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.930
<v Speaker 3>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1709
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:32.770
<v Speaker 3>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sick of this,</v>

1710
01:15:32.771 --> 01:15:35.830
<v Speaker 3>so I just started looking up other shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

1711
01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:37.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

1712
01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:42.930
<v Speaker 3>the big one that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kept coming up that I saw was </v>

1713
01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:43.750

<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't really,</v>

1715
01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:48.610
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was like a party drug and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't really know that much about it.</v>

1716
01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.250
<v Speaker 3>It's a very weird party drugs.</v>

<v Speaker 3>about this guy on.</v>

1724
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:07.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1725
01:16:07.451 --> 01:16:10.000
<v Speaker 3>I think I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1726
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1728
01:16:11.201 --> 01:16:13.990
<v Speaker 3>the guy's name he mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind if you.</v>

1729
01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:15.280
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1730
01:16:15.610 --> 01:16:16.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he,</v>

1731
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:22.000
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was an anesthesiologist who basically</v>

1732
01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:25.780
<v Speaker 3>came up with a Regimen for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for depression and he's,</v>

1733
01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:27.070
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not the only one.</v>

1734
01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:32.100
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's probably hundreds in America </v>

1735
01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:32.100
<v Speaker 3>right now that are doIng this with </v>
<v Speaker 3>ketamine.</v>

1736
01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1737
01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:36.950
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you go on reddit or um,</v>

1738
01:16:37.330 --> 01:16:42.330
<v Speaker 3>and he liked the ending of the boards </v>
<v Speaker 3>and any kind of like a antidepressant </v>

1739
01:16:42.330 --> 01:16:42.340
<v Speaker 3>boards or whatever.</v>

1740
01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:47.820
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people that did it and there's </v>

1741
01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.401
<v Speaker 3>another one called tms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the other one that's making a </v>

1742
01:16:50.401 --> 01:16:51.130
<v Speaker 3>comeback is just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cuckoo's nest one,</v>

1743
01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:55.480
<v Speaker 3>the electrical shock therapy because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were doing it wrong apparently.</v>

1744
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:58.200
<v Speaker 3>And there a way to do it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you just,</v>

1745
01:16:58.590 --> 01:16:59.210
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1746
01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:04.460
<v Speaker 3>the amperage was too high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was just fucking fry cooking if</v>

1747
01:17:06.041 --> 01:17:07.240
<v Speaker 3>you cook it a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1748
01:17:07.241 --> 01:17:08.420
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to it.</v>

1749
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:09.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Precisely.</v>

1750
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.080
<v Speaker 3>You little something steam it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1751
01:17:12.081 --> 01:17:14.010
<v Speaker 3>You can punch in a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you should throw an egg on you,</v>

1752
01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:15.610
<v Speaker 3>your fucking website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1753
01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:20.660
<v Speaker 3>that's made a comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's another one called </v>

1754
01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:22.340
<v Speaker 3>transcranial magnetic stimulation where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they just basically shoot magnet,</v>

1755
01:17:22.341 --> 01:17:23.960
<v Speaker 3>said your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1756
01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:29.260
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's five days a week for five </v>

1757
01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:30.860
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>academy kids.</v>

1758
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:36.100
<v Speaker 3>The treatment is you do six sessions in </v>
<v Speaker 3>two weeks.</v>

1759
01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:37.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

1760
01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.860
<v Speaker 3>So it's monday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wednesday,</v>

1761
01:17:39.861 --> 01:17:44.861
<v Speaker 3>friday of two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I did it last week and the week </v>

1762
01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:47.840
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first time I go in a and again,</v>

1763
01:17:47.841 --> 01:17:49.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I could have researched </v>
<v Speaker 3>it all.</v>

1764
01:17:49.941 --> 01:17:54.941
<v Speaker 3>I knew that was what then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go in you have basically when </v>

1765
01:17:54.941 --> 01:17:57.890
<v Speaker 3>you do ketamine you have like an out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>body sort of experienced meaning,</v>

1766
01:17:57.891 --> 01:18:01.310
<v Speaker 3>like a dissociative experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So which seems pretty vague.</v>

1767
01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:02.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1768
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:07.750
<v Speaker 3>so he hooks the ivy up and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and within 15 seconds I was like gone.</v>

1769
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Like at first you just get sleepy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I was in the trip that you were </v>

1770
01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:23.270
<v Speaker 3>talking about things to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>geometric shapes,</v>

1771
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:28.540
<v Speaker 3>all kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing about tripping that I forgot </v>

1772
01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:29.340
<v Speaker 3>is how good the transitions are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like it'll go from geometric safety,</v>

1773
01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:34.360
<v Speaker 3>like a bear's face to just like just </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit for 45 minutes.</v>

1774
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:41.800
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you come out of it and you </v>

1775
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.390
<v Speaker 3>slowly come out of it and you were like </v>
<v Speaker 3>noise canceling headphones.</v>

1776
01:18:44.391 --> 01:18:46.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm just at a doctor's office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in a weird,</v>

1777
01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:52.120
<v Speaker 3>not even weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like those like 19 seventies doctors' </v>

1778
01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:55.751
<v Speaker 3>offices that you see in la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just sort of a shitty elevator and </v>

1779
01:18:55.751 --> 01:18:55.870
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1780
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:58.970
<v Speaker 3>so when I came out of the first one I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

1781
01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:02.240
<v Speaker 3>it was rough because I didn't know it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to trip like that.</v>

1782
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:04.670
<v Speaker 3>And b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had been,</v>

1783
01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:08.030
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get a ton of sleep the night </v>
<v Speaker 3>before and uh,</v>

1784
01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.980
<v Speaker 3>so I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd flown that day.</v>

1785
01:19:09.981 --> 01:19:14.981
<v Speaker 3>I was just kind of groggy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I felt really shitty and it took me </v>

1786
01:19:15.711 --> 01:19:17.420
<v Speaker 3>like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after I was done,</v>

1787
01:19:17.421 --> 01:19:20.570
<v Speaker 3>I probably laid in the bed there for </v>
<v Speaker 3>like an hour,</v>

1788
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:22.850
<v Speaker 3>so it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do shit right now.</v>

1789
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:24.830
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could barely stand.</v>

1790
01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:30.640
<v Speaker 3>So the first day was rough and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that I still felt shitty that night </v>

1791
01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.320
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm going to do it again.</v>

1792
01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.580
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was too rough.</v>

1793
01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:40.150
<v Speaker 3>And then I woke up tuesday morning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>felt fucking great.</v>

1794
01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:42.500
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1795
01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:44.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to do it again,</v>

1796
01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.360
<v Speaker 3>felt great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt clear.</v>

1797
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:49.060
<v Speaker 3>Here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways my,</v>

1798
01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:54.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression manifested itself was like,</v>

1799
01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:59.080
<v Speaker 3>I felt my head felt heavy and I felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had like,</v>

1800
01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:03.730
<v Speaker 3>I had like a lead weight on my forehead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1801
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:06.050
<v Speaker 3>that's the way I felt when I did </v>
<v Speaker 3>ecstasy.</v>

1802
01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:11.360
<v Speaker 3>You say after the day after I felt it </v>
<v Speaker 3>felt amazing when I did it.</v>

1803
01:20:11.410 --> 01:20:13.830
<v Speaker 3>And that's what it is because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>depletes.</v>

1804
01:20:13.831 --> 01:20:15.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get all the serotonin's gun.</v>

1805
01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:20.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's basically what people with </v>

1806
01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:21.660
<v Speaker 3>depression a lot of times are like just </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday isn't just like a headwind.</v>

1807
01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:23.760
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like fucking,</v>

1808
01:20:23.761 --> 01:20:28.761
<v Speaker 3>could thIs be a little bit easier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not asking for a miracle and </v>

1809
01:20:28.761 --> 01:20:30.780
<v Speaker 3>just like I'm just sick of having to </v>
<v Speaker 3>walk into the wind all the time.</v>

1810
01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:33.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit uphill into the windows.</v>

1811
01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.110
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

1812
01:20:34.650 --> 01:20:39.650
<v Speaker 3>So I did it again that wednesday and </v>
<v Speaker 3>every time I did it,</v>

1813
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:42.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1814
01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:43.190
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing that,</v>

1815
01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.030
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways that they kind of gauge </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as,</v>

1816
01:20:45.031 --> 01:20:48.690
<v Speaker 3>do you do like a inventory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a questionnaire,</v>

1817
01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:53.720
<v Speaker 3>like a 25 question questionnaire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you feel about your future?</v>

1818
01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:56.700
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like not good,</v>

1819
01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:58.410
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neutral,</v>

1820
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:59.710
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1821
01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:04.320
<v Speaker 3>each one has a point value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They add it up if it's like in the teens</v>

1822
01:21:04.321 --> 01:21:07.830
<v Speaker 3>or high teens or twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means you're depressed if you're in</v>

1823
01:21:07.831 --> 01:21:09.260
<v Speaker 3>the under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1824
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:10.770
<v Speaker 3>the low teens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're good,</v>

1825
01:21:10.771 --> 01:21:15.771
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think mine went from low twenties </v>

1826
01:21:15.771 --> 01:21:19.260
<v Speaker 3>to like single digits in the two weeks.</v>

1827
01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:23.760
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only downside,</v>

1828
01:21:23.761 --> 01:21:28.761
<v Speaker 3>and I can't get it like perfectly clear </v>
<v Speaker 3>read because I'm quitting the ssri when </v>

1829
01:21:29.191 --> 01:21:29.480
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1830
01:21:29.481 --> 01:21:30.690
<v Speaker 3>the one that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the deq killer,</v>

1831
01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:34.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm quitting that at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm just like,</v>

1832
01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:39.230
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of having withdrawal from that </v>

1833
01:21:39.230 --> 01:21:39.230
<v Speaker 3>and the way it was manifesting itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a couple of weeks was like,</v>

1834
01:21:39.230 --> 01:21:44.181
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like I had the flu but not </v>

1835
01:21:44.181 --> 01:21:44.181
<v Speaker 3>coughing or sneezing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like rundown.</v>

1836
01:21:44.181 --> 01:21:48.950
<v Speaker 3>When you wean yourself off of an ssri,</v>

<v Speaker 3>itself now is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my eyes is a little flight.</v>

<v Speaker 2>days afterwards did you feel great?</v>

01:23:27.330 --> 01:23:28.450
<v Speaker 3>laid in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on my account.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

1878
01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:34.360
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1879

1880
01:23:37.321 --> 01:23:39.420
<v Speaker 3>that feeling.</v>

1881
01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Was it possible that it was the stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the experience?</v>

1882
01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Because you didn't know?</v>

1883
01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1884
01:23:46.151 --> 01:23:49.270
<v Speaker 3>because you ever haD anesthesia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to come out of it.</v>

1885
01:23:50.050 --> 01:23:52.840
<v Speaker 3>It feels that's like my least favorite </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling in the world.</v>

1886
01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:56.200
<v Speaker 3>That's basically what it was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling of like,</v>

1887
01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:58.630
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>

1889
01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:04.860
<v Speaker 2>So it could be a bunch of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have the same feeling every time </v>

1890
01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:04.860

<v Speaker 3>wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a nap and did a spot that night.</v>

1897
01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.660
<v Speaker 3>We talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was at the improv.</v>

1898
01:24:24.661 --> 01:24:29.010

<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>

1903
01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:44.180

<v Speaker 3>what was interesting was every session </v>

1904
01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:44.970
<v Speaker 3>it would take me longer to go into the </v>

01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:46.950
<v Speaker 3>meaning like my body was getting used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1906
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:50.010
<v Speaker 3>It was building up a tolerance for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the ketamine.</v>

01:27:04.481 --> 01:27:07.870
<v Speaker 2>all these different ideas and like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just frustrating.</v>

1952
01:27:07.871 --> 01:27:08.740
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1953
01:27:08.741 --> 01:27:12.550
<v Speaker 2>So you do it the first time and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next day you feel great.</v>

1954
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:16.710
<v Speaker 2>You are still on the ssri or your </v>
<v Speaker 2>window?</v>

1955
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I was done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean i'vE done now withdrawing off of </v>

1956
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:23.290
<v Speaker 2>them because this is something that is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big issue with iowasca.</v>

1957
01:27:23.770 --> 01:27:24.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the I say,</v>

1958
01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:26.750
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to john bosco.</v>

1959
01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take iowasca guilt die,</v>

1960
01:27:31.391 --> 01:27:31.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1961
01:27:31.901 --> 01:27:36.901
<v Speaker 2>it's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ssri or dangerous with iowasca with </v>

1962
01:27:36.901 --> 01:27:40.741
<v Speaker 2>dimethyltryptamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with in mushrooms are very closely </v>

1963
01:27:40.741 --> 01:27:42.300
<v Speaker 2>related to d to dimethyltryptamine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:47.760
<v Speaker 2>There's people that take mushrooms and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they also are taking an ssri and I've </v>

1965
01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:48.280
<v Speaker 2>heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of funky too.</v>

1966
01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think if I've ever done </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1967
01:27:50.530 --> 01:27:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Ari was on ssri I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was taking mushrooms,</v>

1968
01:27:53.441 --> 01:27:55.810
<v Speaker 2>so I think I've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he was on a different kind of.</v>

1969
01:27:55.811 --> 01:27:59.170
<v Speaker 2>I think I've met a pagan ssri.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know for a fact are.</v>

1970
01:27:59.171 --> 01:28:02.890
<v Speaker 2>He did ask his doctor and told him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently the type of medication he was</v>

1971
01:28:02.891 --> 01:28:04.360
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was fine with nordstrom's.</v>

1972
01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:07.590
<v Speaker 2>The ta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I did it once or twice on ssr is</v>

1973
01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:12.640
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which really dangerous apparently is if </v>

1974
01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:16.051
<v Speaker 2>you take a prescription mao inhibitor </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you take mushrooms or you take </v>

1975
01:28:16.331 --> 01:28:18.480
<v Speaker 2>iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's super fucking devic.</v>

1976
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Mio.</v>

1977
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:24.590
<v Speaker 3>Mao inhibitors have a big profile which </v>
<v Speaker 3>like don't take it to the other shit </v>

1978
01:28:24.930 --> 01:28:29.930
<v Speaker 3>that has more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's on more warning for the most </v>

1979
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:29.930
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1980
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:29.930
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1981
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:31.410
<v Speaker 3>I believe I've read this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like 98 percent sure I read this.</v>

1982
01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.050
<v Speaker 3>Most people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1983
01:28:34.051 --> 01:28:35.250
<v Speaker 3>I did read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

1984
01:28:35.251 --> 01:28:37.350
<v Speaker 3>this guy Carl Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who'd be a great guest.</v>

1985
01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1986
01:28:38.281 --> 01:28:38.910
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

1987
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:44.510
<v Speaker 3>That guy's fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm said that most people that die of </v>

1988
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:48.681
<v Speaker 3>heroin overdoses are drunk like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most of the overdoses are because </v>

1989
01:28:49.261 --> 01:28:51.030
<v Speaker 3>they combined it with alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

1990
01:28:51.090 --> 01:28:51.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1991
01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:54.190
<v Speaker 2>He was on o'reilly the other day and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>texted him.</v>

1992
01:28:54.610 --> 01:28:56.740
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck do you do that?</v>

1993
01:28:57.010 --> 01:28:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Like you talked for five seconds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's touching you,</v>

1994
01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:04.760
<v Speaker 2>and then they caught away him for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking news report on the lady getting</v>

1995
01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:07.920
<v Speaker 2>arraigned and upstate New York for </v>
<v Speaker 2>helping the prisoners escape.</v>

1996
01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.100
<v Speaker 2>There's a panel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's him and a bunch of other people.</v>

1997
01:29:11.101 --> 01:29:13.740
<v Speaker 2>They're all talking about drugs and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>barely got a chance to talk.</v>

1998
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.460
<v Speaker 2>It's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what good does that shit too.</v>

1999
01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:18.210
<v Speaker 2>That's what I always wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when they go,</v>

2000
01:29:18.211 --> 01:29:19.950
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to come on a panel on cnn?</v>

2001
01:29:19.951 --> 01:29:20.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2002
01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to change any minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also shitty way of community.</v>

2003
01:29:24.111 --> 01:29:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2004
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:26.940
<v Speaker 2>This is the way to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2005
01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:31.980
<v Speaker 2>This is the best way in woodland hills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hit it off as part.</v>

2006
01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's shitty.</v>

2007
01:29:32.851 --> 01:29:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Office park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the way to do it,</v>

2008
01:29:35.071 --> 01:29:35.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Under lighting.</v>

2009
01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:41.570
<v Speaker 2>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you go and you do it the first time </v>

2010
01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:44.490
<v Speaker 2>that day afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start to feel better in the way.</v>

2011
01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:50.020
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would compare the trip in and of </v>

2012
01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:51.450
<v Speaker 3>itself the actual trip like lsd,</v>

2013
01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:53.590
<v Speaker 2>lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ellis without the speed.</v>

2014
01:29:53.710 --> 01:29:56.500
<v Speaker 2>But with a lot of visuals though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All visuals.</v>

2015
01:29:56.670 --> 01:29:57.590
<v Speaker 2>All visual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2016
01:29:57.790 --> 01:30:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way mckenna described ketamine,</v>

2017
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I've never done ketamine the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2018
01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:07.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makenna and john lilly was a huge </v>

2019
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.830
<v Speaker 2>pioneer of ketamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2020
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:12.430
<v Speaker 2>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John lilly's the guy who invented the </v>

2021
01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:13.741
<v Speaker 2>isolation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of his things that he used to like </v>

2022
01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:14.840
<v Speaker 2>to do is shoot ketamine in a muscularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intramuscularly,</v>

2023
01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:18.160
<v Speaker 2>shove it right into his fucking muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what I did.</v>

2024
01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:23.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the intramuscular is a slower </v>

2025
01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:26.881
<v Speaker 2>release and apparent last for hours and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he would bang whack himself and climate </v>

2026
01:30:26.981 --> 01:30:31.981
<v Speaker 2>of the tank and be gone for a fun day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just zoom around crazy and mckenna </v>

2027
01:30:31.981 --> 01:30:36.721
<v Speaker 2>described it like he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very interesting way of </v>

2028
01:30:36.721 --> 01:30:40.350
<v Speaker 2>describing psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believed whether or not I was to </v>

2029
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:43.671
<v Speaker 2>correct it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he believed that every psychedelic </v>

2030
01:30:43.671 --> 01:30:43.800
<v Speaker 2>you take your.</v>

2031
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:48.830
<v Speaker 2>You're experiencing not just your trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the trip of all the people who've </v>

2032
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:51.190
<v Speaker 2>ever tripped on that psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're taking mushrooms,</v>

2033
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:53.920
<v Speaker 2>you're not just experiencing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushroom,</v>

2034
01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:59.100
<v Speaker 2>you're experiencing the mushroom as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has interfaced with countless human </v>

2035
01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:00.070
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all throughout humanity,</v>

2036
01:31:00.071 --> 01:31:05.071
<v Speaker 2>all the different people have taken the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms and had these beautiful </v>

2037
01:31:05.071 --> 01:31:08.011
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You experienced those experiences as </v>

2038
01:31:08.011 --> 01:31:08.011
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2039
01:31:08.011 --> 01:31:08.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2040
01:31:08.011 --> 01:31:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't disagree.</v>

2041
01:31:08.471 --> 01:31:10.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with that because I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>put it seems like.</v>

2042
01:31:10.751 --> 01:31:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's possible,</v>

2043
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:16.830
<v Speaker 2>but what he said about ketamine was he </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt like ketamine was a new drug and </v>

2044
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:20.621
<v Speaker 2>these felt like when he took ketamine </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was in a giant office building </v>

2045
01:31:20.621 --> 01:31:23.200
<v Speaker 2>that was empty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a vacant office building.</v>

2046
01:31:23.410 --> 01:31:28.410
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would walk around and there was no </v>

2047
01:31:28.410 --> 01:31:28.410
<v Speaker 2>one there who would like look around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was cubicles,</v>

2048
01:31:28.410 --> 01:31:30.400
<v Speaker 2>there was lights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this big open spaces,</v>

2049
01:31:30.401 --> 01:31:35.401
<v Speaker 2>but there was no one in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just devoid of the kind of </v>

2050
01:31:35.401 --> 01:31:37.840
<v Speaker 2>experience that you have when you take </v>
<v Speaker 2>other sorts of psychedelics.</v>

2051
01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Did you expire within</v>

2052
01:31:39.850 --> 01:31:44.850
<v Speaker 3>the things that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember one of the things I remember </v>

2053
01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:47.430
<v Speaker 3>was like getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would start on me and then just pull </v>

2054
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:48.330
<v Speaker 3>out wide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

2055
01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:53.420
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like google maps or in my head it was </v>

2056
01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:53.460
<v Speaker 3>more like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2057
01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:58.040
<v Speaker 3>grand theft auto and like where I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2058
01:31:58.120 --> 01:31:59.320
<v Speaker 3>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2059
01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:01.350
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in santa monica and I just go,</v>

2060
01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:02.710

<v Speaker 3>there's whatever.</v>

2061
01:32:02.711 --> 01:32:03.780
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2062
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:08.800
<v Speaker 3>I was aware of every sort of your whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience of people that I went to high</v>

2063
01:32:08.801 --> 01:32:12.510
<v Speaker 3>school with people that I know now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just every woman's sort of,</v>

2064
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:15.460
<v Speaker 3>they're not like actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sort of,</v>

2065
01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:16.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about them.</v>

2066
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it was like I was in the matrix</v>

2067
01:32:22.781 --> 01:32:25.750
<v Speaker 3>is too simplistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you,</v>

2068
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:28.630
<v Speaker 3>did you see the new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2069
01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:33.660
<v Speaker 3>lAnded the last perhaps will pharrel </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just a weird black void scene.</v>

2070
01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like basically a black void </v>
<v Speaker 3>with like a tron floor.</v>

2071
01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was like a,</v>

2072
01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:43.050
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2073
01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:45.280
<v Speaker 3>there was no tron floor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

2074
01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:46.930
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a white sort of,</v>

2075
01:32:46.931 --> 01:32:49.450
<v Speaker 3>it was more of a disco floor actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>then have white.</v>

2076
01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:54.780
<v Speaker 3>This was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have the disco floor but I did </v>

2077
01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:56.611
<v Speaker 3>have the sort of black void and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit would form out of that and it was </v>

2078
01:32:56.611 --> 01:33:01.201
<v Speaker 3>sort of lit the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was like the fill lighting as </v>

2079
01:33:01.201 --> 01:33:05.031
<v Speaker 3>they call it would be green.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like the way your walls red it would </v>

2080
01:33:05.031 --> 01:33:05.530
<v Speaker 3>be great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2081
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:08.060
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was a very,</v>

2082
01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:11.360
<v Speaker 3>he just made a great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm back there.</v>

2083
01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:16.900
<v Speaker 3>So the trip was pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was never like,</v>

2084
01:33:16.901 --> 01:33:18.310
<v Speaker 3>I've never freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never.</v>

2085
01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:23.760
<v Speaker 4>Did you experience at entities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does anything that you were </v>

2086
01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:24.310
<v Speaker 4>communicating with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was all just shapes?</v>

2087
01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:25.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was all shapes.</v>

2088
01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:30.900
<v Speaker 4>So it was just shapes and feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like shapes and like I would think of </v>

2089
01:33:30.971 --> 01:33:35.971
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you say you would think of </v>

2090
01:33:35.971 --> 01:33:38.161
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the stuff that you would think of </v>

2091
01:33:38.161 --> 01:33:38.610
<v Speaker 4>related to depression?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it related to that?</v>

2092
01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:41.590
<v Speaker 4>Because what I'm trying to do right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

2093
01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:47.040
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like what kind of stuff was going </v>

2094
01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:47.040
<v Speaker 4>through your head while you're having </v>
<v Speaker 4>this?</v>

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.900
<v Speaker 3>like love and fucking like the time I </v>
<v Speaker 3>went in the hulk music on,</v>

2097
01:33:51.650 --> 01:33:54.900
<v Speaker 3>into anytime someone starts the time I </v>
<v Speaker 3>did the,</v>

2098
01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:59.960
<v Speaker 3>the float labs thing made me get a dog </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I went to float labs and I </v>

2099

<v Speaker 3>floated and I was in the middle of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got you got to love something man.</v>

2100

<v Speaker 3>And I got it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2101
01:34:07.530 --> 01:34:12.530
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that dog has been the bane of my </v>

2102

<v Speaker 3>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting that dog has bit more people</v>

2103
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:16.630

<v Speaker 3>Old ladies.</v>

2104
01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.150
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2105
01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:19.950
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

2106
01:34:19.951 --> 01:34:21.480
<v Speaker 3>I thought about life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just think about it,</v>

2107
01:34:21.481 --> 01:34:24.000
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>

2108
01:34:24.001 --> 01:34:24.810
<v Speaker 3>it was more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2109
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:29.870
<v Speaker 3>I thought about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if there's an earthquake also like </v>

2110
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:32.700
<v Speaker 3>fucking if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're tripping on,</v>

2111
01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:35.190
<v Speaker 3>on like ketamine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gone.</v>

2112
01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:36.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my eyes are closed.</v>

2113
01:34:36.781 --> 01:34:41.781
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't open them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I wouldn't physically been able to </v>

2114
01:34:41.781 --> 01:34:44.961
<v Speaker 3>open them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously what if there's an </v>

2115
01:34:44.961 --> 01:34:44.961
<v Speaker 3>earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I just feel like,</v>

2116
01:34:45.010 --> 01:34:47.530
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a weird thing to focus on.</v>

2117
01:34:47.531 --> 01:34:50.790
<v Speaker 4>So you try to sell it to my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would just come into my like,</v>

2118
01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:52.150
<v Speaker 4>don't you get that when you're on weed </v>
<v Speaker 4>though?</v>

2119
01:34:52.151 --> 01:34:53.980
<v Speaker 4>sometimes I don't do weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh that's right.</v>

2120
01:34:54.930 --> 01:34:59.600
<v Speaker 4>We will let you consider all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible fuckups that could go wrong.</v>

2121
01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:01.040
<v Speaker 4>even the earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2122
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:02.870
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get demolished till you die.</v>

2123
01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:05.270
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It felt like more of like a.</v>

2124
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:10.390
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was going to be like the san andreas </v>

2125
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.390
<v Speaker 4>and the rock would not say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2126
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:13.490
<v Speaker 4>what would they think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it comes to psychedelic experiences</v>

2127
01:35:13.491 --> 01:35:18.491
<v Speaker 4>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's your thing about psychedelic </v>

2128
01:35:18.491 --> 01:35:20.950
<v Speaker 4>experiences that's universal is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>eagle dissolving properties of it and </v>

2129
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:24.341
<v Speaker 4>they think that a lot of this wood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that feeling is when you're trying to,</v>

2130
01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:30.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to try to think about all the things </v>

2131
01:35:30.190 --> 01:35:31.731
<v Speaker 4>that go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost your ego not wanting to let </v>

2132
01:35:31.731 --> 01:35:31.731
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

2133
01:35:31.731 --> 01:35:35.701
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need the man because one of the </v>

2134
01:35:35.701 --> 01:35:35.701
<v Speaker 4>flood and earthquake happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or what if you know,</v>

2135
01:35:35.701 --> 01:35:39.180
<v Speaker 4>what if something's happening right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if someone's breaking into your </v>

2136
01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:39.560
<v Speaker 4>car?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about the paranoia and the fear?</v>

2137
01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:42.230
<v Speaker 4>The survival instinct as a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ego.</v>

2138
01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.220
<v Speaker 4>It felt like</v>

2139
01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:47.670
<v Speaker 3>I was backstage in my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense,</v>

2140
01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:51.310
<v Speaker 3>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was seeing the mechanations I was</v>

2141
01:35:51.311 --> 01:35:56.311
<v Speaker 3>feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd also like see the see like how </v>

2142
01:35:56.311 --> 01:35:56.311
<v Speaker 3>it got there.</v>

2143
01:35:56.311 --> 01:35:57.570
<v Speaker 4>So you can see the wiring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2144
01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.510
<v Speaker 4>that's what I always feel like when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

2145
01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:01.280
<v Speaker 4>When I did lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I.</v>

2146
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:03.230
<v Speaker 4>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I did the ketamine,</v>

2147
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:04.010
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2148
01:36:04.011 --> 01:36:06.290
<v Speaker 4>it feels like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels like my brain.</v>

2149
01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:09.020
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I'm like getting a tour of </v>
<v Speaker 4>my brain.</v>

2150
01:36:09.170 --> 01:36:14.170
<v Speaker 4>So what supposed to be the mechanism for</v>
<v Speaker 4>repair or for and another thing that </v>

2151
01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:15.690
<v Speaker 4>they don't know</v>

2152
01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:20.820
<v Speaker 3>really know they don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can tell you that it worked like </v>

2153
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:29.440
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt I felt better every day.</v>

2154
01:36:30.010 --> 01:36:35.010
<v Speaker 3>It has to do with the ssrs for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I Also feel like the thing that's </v>

2155
01:36:35.010 --> 01:36:36.700
<v Speaker 3>been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been noticing is,</v>

2156
01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:40.930
<v Speaker 3>and thIs is such a weird symptom of </v>
<v Speaker 3>improvement,</v>

2157
01:36:41.410 --> 01:36:46.410
<v Speaker 3>I've been laughing at my own jokes more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which sounds like it's fucking.</v>

2158
01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're an egomaniac.</v>

2159
01:36:48.190 --> 01:36:53.190
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just enjoying the idea as like an </v>

2160
01:36:53.441 --> 01:36:55.060
<v Speaker 3>independent thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2161
01:36:55.090 --> 01:37:00.090
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm having fun like me and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>person are playing for lack of a better </v>

2162
01:37:00.090 --> 01:37:00.090
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>LIke we're just fucking around,</v>

2163
01:37:00.090 --> 01:37:01.060
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

2164
01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:05.540
<v Speaker 3>So that to me is a symptom of feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>better and I also physical</v>

2165
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:07.760
<v Speaker 4>please feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2166
01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:10.370
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the first one makes you feel better.</v>

2167
01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:12.350
<v Speaker 4>Is there an increase every time you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

2168
01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:15.140
<v Speaker 4>Two through six.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't tell me.</v>

2169
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:17.210
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm betting there was.</v>

2170
01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:19.660
<v Speaker 4>You mean an increase in dosage?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm at an eight.</v>

2171
01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:21.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2172
01:37:21.811 --> 01:37:22.440
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2173
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Because I feel it would take me longer </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get into the trip and then the </v>

2174
01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:30.660
<v Speaker 3>hangover would be way less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think last friday I didn't take a</v>

2175
01:37:30.661 --> 01:37:31.970
<v Speaker 3>nap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2176
01:37:32.050 --> 01:37:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact I know it didn't take a nap </v>

2177
01:37:37.050 --> 01:37:37.080
<v Speaker 3>cause I got it at four and I had like an</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

2178
01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:39.270
<v Speaker 3>15.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I did.</v>

2179
01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:44.300
<v Speaker 3>I was tripping from 4:15</v>
<v Speaker 3>to five and then figured out how to go </v>

2180
01:37:45.570 --> 01:37:48.060
<v Speaker 3>and had a good set.</v>

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:54.560
<v Speaker 4>So is this something that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have to repeat or is it supposed to </v>

2183
01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.830
<v Speaker 4>be like you whack it out and point?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2188
01:38:04.591 --> 01:38:07.020
<v Speaker 3>can be a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did tell me,</v>

2189
01:38:07.021 --> 01:38:12.021
<v Speaker 3>he said this will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the things that will make it </v>

2190
01:38:12.021 --> 01:38:12.021
<v Speaker 3>last longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Diet,</v>

<v Speaker 3>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obvious sleep.</v>

2192
01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:17.160

<v Speaker 3>It's like let wake up early if you can.</v>

2193
01:38:17.161 --> 01:38:19.380
<v Speaker 3>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And another doctor told me that like,</v>

2194
01:38:19.381 --> 01:38:22.260
<v Speaker 3>more serotonin is produced early in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>day than,</v>

2195
01:38:22.261 --> 01:38:23.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than late.</v>

<v Speaker 2>early to rise.</v>

2197
01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's basically like,</v>

2198
01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:31.460
<v Speaker 2>that's better for your mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keeps him helped.</v>

2199
01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

2200
01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:36.370
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if like going to bed,</v>

2201
01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:38.020
<v Speaker 2>what are you trying to wake up at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven or eight.</v>

2202
01:38:38.110 --> 01:38:39.250
<v Speaker 2>But how are you going to go to bed </v>
<v Speaker 2>early?</v>

2203
01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.840
<v Speaker 2>You're a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't yet.</v>

2204
01:38:41.010 --> 01:38:42.500
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2205
01:38:42.710 --> 01:38:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Just going to be tired all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2206
01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:46.210
<v Speaker 2>but I can go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're weeks,</v>

2207
01:38:46.210 --> 01:38:48.170
<v Speaker 2>days during the week I go to bed at </v>
<v Speaker 2>midnight or one.</v>

2208
01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I do feel like there's ideas that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>available to you when you wake up early </v>

2209
01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:54.370
<v Speaker 2>in the morning that aren't available to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you at any other time of the day.</v>

2210
01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:59.660
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I forced myself to get up </v>

2211
01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:01.860
<v Speaker 2>early in the morning just to sit down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and write because I think sometimes I </v>

2212
01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:02.260
<v Speaker 2>forced myself awake.</v>

2213
01:39:02.290 --> 01:39:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll set my alarm for six and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get up and I'll sit in front of the</v>

2214
01:39:06.101 --> 01:39:11.101
<v Speaker 2>computer at 6:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>AM all cloudy I'd but then somewhere on </v>

2215
01:39:11.101 --> 01:39:11.290
<v Speaker 2>like six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>26,</v>

2216
01:39:11.291 --> 01:39:16.291
<v Speaker 2>45,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six slash 15 slash 20 minutes later I </v>

2217
01:39:16.291 --> 01:39:16.291
<v Speaker 2>start getting ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2218
01:39:16.291 --> 01:39:17.860
<v Speaker 2>And then they start coming out and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

2219
01:39:17.861 --> 01:39:22.861
<v Speaker 2>this is initial wake up and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee hits in and is initial wakeup </v>

2220
01:39:22.861 --> 01:39:26.881
<v Speaker 2>ideas I think are almost different </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're really connected to the </v>

2221
01:39:26.881 --> 01:39:30.211
<v Speaker 2>sleep world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were just sleeping just a small </v>

2222
01:39:30.211 --> 01:39:32.350
<v Speaker 2>amount of time ago and you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have defenses at that point.</v>

2223
01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:34.300
<v Speaker 2>You can't be like stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just like,</v>

2224
01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:39.320
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's one of the reasons why </v>

2225
01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:39.320
<v Speaker 2>people like write like writing really </v>
<v Speaker 2>silly shit late at night.</v>

2226
01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Like the news radio writers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even start working until </v>

2227
01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:44.580
<v Speaker 2>like 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning.</v>

2228
01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that was mostly paul.</v>

2229
01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paul,</v>

2230
01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:47.950
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul had been in his twenties and it was</v>

2231
01:39:47.951 --> 01:39:52.951
<v Speaker 2>also a method to his madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like paul knew what he was doing and </v>

2232
01:39:52.951 --> 01:39:54.760
<v Speaker 2>they would write the silliest shit cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were barely awake.</v>

2233
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:57.940
<v Speaker 2>They were just like laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd always heard that that show,</v>

2234
01:39:57.941 --> 01:40:00.110
<v Speaker 2>they just play video games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's mostly what the writers,</v>

2235
01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:05.200
<v Speaker 2>they got me addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a local area network set up </v>

2236
01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:09.061
<v Speaker 2>with computers playing quake on them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would go there and we'd all played </v>

2237
01:40:09.061 --> 01:40:09.070
<v Speaker 2>real time against each other and talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2238
01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:11.710
<v Speaker 2>laugh and oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so addictive.</v>

2239
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:13.390
<v Speaker 2>I liked being up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

2240
01:40:13.391 --> 01:40:15.550
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I don't like getting up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like being a right,</v>

2241
01:40:15.551 --> 01:40:18.260
<v Speaker 2>getting up as the hard part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>forcing yourself to get up out of bed.</v>

2242
01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:20.720
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a thing on my phone that's really</v>

2243
01:40:20.721 --> 01:40:24.050
<v Speaker 3>funny and like it's either for you or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

2244
01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:25.280
<v Speaker 3>It's called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an app called.</v>

2245
01:40:25.281 --> 01:40:27.260
<v Speaker 3>I can't wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2246
01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:29.030
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an alarm clock.</v>

2247
01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:32.300
<v Speaker 3>It goes off it like plays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>music or whatever,</v>

2248
01:40:32.301 --> 01:40:33.710
<v Speaker 3>chime or vibrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2249
01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:39.410
<v Speaker 3>In order to turn it off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to basically enter a code,</v>

2250
01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:45.350
<v Speaker 3>so it's like a 25 or 30 character code </v>
<v Speaker 3>caps numbers.</v>

2251
01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:48.770
<v Speaker 3>Lower case takes fucking 55 seconds</v>

2252
01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.960
<v Speaker 2>and by the time you're done you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

2253
01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

2254
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:59.220
<v Speaker 4>If you're doing that next to a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're dating a girl and she doesn't </v>

2255
01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:02.000
<v Speaker 4>have to get up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'd be so mad at you fucking asshole.</v>

2256
01:41:02.001 --> 01:41:05.790
<v Speaker 4>He just out of the battery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2257
01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:07.840

<v Speaker 4>it's really funny.</v>

2258
01:41:07.841 --> 01:41:08.590
<v Speaker 4>And it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>

2259
01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:11.140
<v Speaker 4>I have no problem getting up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like it,</v>

2260
01:41:11.141 --> 01:41:12.340
<v Speaker 4>but I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2261
01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:15.430
<v Speaker 4>But I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up getting up every day because I</v>

2262
01:41:15.431 --> 01:41:20.350
<v Speaker 4>had a paper route for the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Was like 17 till I was like 21,</v>

2263
01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:24.330
<v Speaker 4>maybe even 22.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kept it until um,</v>

2264
01:41:24.331 --> 01:41:27.160
<v Speaker 4>so I guess I'm used to just get up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get up,</v>

2265
01:41:27.970 --> 01:41:30.010

2267
01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:34.150

<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

2268
01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:37.780
<v Speaker 4>it was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was at the fair talk therapy.</v>

2269
01:41:38.230 --> 01:41:40.420
<v Speaker 4>Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a thing with therapy?</v>

2270
01:41:40.421 --> 01:41:43.030
<v Speaker 4>I got so sick of talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2271
01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:46.420
<v Speaker 4>I need a physical cure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I know what the problems are.</v>

2272
01:41:46.890 --> 01:41:47.630
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2273
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:49.920
<v Speaker 4>it's not making me feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

2274
01:41:49.930 --> 01:41:51.940
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking physical issue.</v>

2275
01:41:51.941 --> 01:41:53.890
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I promise you because that's pretty much</v>

2276
01:41:53.891 --> 01:41:54.880
<v Speaker 4>been established,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2277
01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:59.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's pretty much established that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are large majority of people or a large </v>

2278
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:03.230
<v Speaker 4>number of people that have depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There iS a dip.</v>

2279
01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:06.340
<v Speaker 4>There's a depleted amount of serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2280
01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.480
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2282
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:10.390
<v Speaker 4>As far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's established,</v>

2283
01:42:10.690 --> 01:42:15.690
<v Speaker 4>but they don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there are certain therapies,</v>

2284
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:21.750
<v Speaker 4>cbt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cognitive behavioral therapy that works </v>

<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2289
01:42:28.901 --> 01:42:31.900
<v Speaker 4>do they measure your serotonin?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take your blood and they have.</v>

2290
01:42:31.930 --> 01:42:33.580
<v Speaker 4>They don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have a measurement for it.</v>

2291
01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:34.660

01:42:36.461 --> 01:42:38.620
<v Speaker 4>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've googled it because I've been like,</v>

2294
01:42:38.621 --> 01:42:40.000
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck do I prove this?</v>

2295
01:42:40.030 --> 01:42:42.370
<v Speaker 4>But theY can't have serotonin syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2296
01:42:42.371 --> 01:42:47.371
<v Speaker 4>Where you were taking five htp and an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ssri and it gives you too much </v>

2297
01:42:47.371 --> 01:42:47.590
<v Speaker 4>serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It cAn really fuck with you.</v>

2298
01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:52.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how do they know it's given you too </v>

2299
01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:52.680
<v Speaker 4>much there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think by the symptoms,</v>

2300
01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.580
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seems like,</v>

2301
01:42:54.730 --> 01:42:59.730
<v Speaker 4>it seems weird that they don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way of measuring what your levels are </v>

2302
01:42:59.730 --> 01:42:59.760
<v Speaker 4>because can they originally level the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dope?</v>

2303
01:42:59.761 --> 01:43:01.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

2304
01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:05.530
<v Speaker 4>The brain is so fucking calm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2305
01:43:05.531 --> 01:43:10.531
<v Speaker 4>they know nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know nothing about it because it's </v>

2306
01:43:10.531 --> 01:43:10.531
<v Speaker 4>impossible to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no.</v>

2307
01:43:10.531 --> 01:43:11.740
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can look at a heart.</v>

2308
01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:14.170
<v Speaker 4>Most of it that's physical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like blood,</v>

2309
01:43:14.171 --> 01:43:15.880
<v Speaker 4>the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the liquid goes in,</v>

2310
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:17.950
<v Speaker 4>then it comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's mechanical,</v>

2311
01:43:17.951 --> 01:43:20.080
<v Speaker 4>whereas the brain is not mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 4>will.</v>

2312
01:43:20.081 --> 01:43:22.270
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that you brought up </v>
<v Speaker 4>was Carl Hart,</v>

2313
01:43:22.271 --> 01:43:23.230
<v Speaker 4>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carl Hart,</v>

2314
01:43:23.231 --> 01:43:28.231
<v Speaker 4>and there's a lot of really brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 4>people today that are trying to get </v>

2315
01:43:28.231 --> 01:43:29.670
<v Speaker 4>people to understand addictions and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2316
01:43:29.671 --> 01:43:31.480
<v Speaker 4>what are the root cause of addiction.</v>

2317
01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:35.920
<v Speaker 4>And gabor montay had uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some interesting stuff to say about that</v>

2318
01:43:35.921 --> 01:43:40.420
<v Speaker 4>too in the movie the culture high and </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the main issues are talking about</v>

2319
01:43:40.421 --> 01:43:45.421
<v Speaker 4>is that a lot of these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>addicted that deal with addictions or </v>

2320
01:43:45.421 --> 01:43:49.591
<v Speaker 4>people that are depressed and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have like these moments in their </v>

2321
01:43:49.591 --> 01:43:52.711
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to get over the hump </v>

2322
01:43:52.711 --> 01:43:54.570
<v Speaker 4>there dealing with childhood abuse or </v>
<v Speaker 4>their ge dealing with childhood stress </v>

2323
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:59.050
<v Speaker 4>or really trying to tell me I have ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2324
01:43:59.130 --> 01:44:01.220
<v Speaker 4>A lot of therapists will minute will you</v>
<v Speaker 4>had,</v>

2325
01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.650
<v Speaker 4>you didn't have the easiest childhood?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2326
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:07.100
<v Speaker 4>I think it's partially like my dad never</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit me,</v>

2327
01:44:07.101 --> 01:44:09.620
<v Speaker 4>but he used to beat the shit out of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>brothers and I was like three,</v>

2328
01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:12.890
<v Speaker 4>so I think that must have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2329
01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.870
<v Speaker 4>traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How could it not be?</v>

2330
01:44:15.170 --> 01:44:16.660
<v Speaker 4>How could it not be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2331
01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:19.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean I can imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even imagine that.</v>

2332
01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:20.930
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was shitty.</v>

2333
01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:23.720
<v Speaker 4>It's just a shitty way to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then like there's so many kids,</v>

2334
01:44:23.721 --> 01:44:26.570
<v Speaker 4>you don't get enough nutrients </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically.</v>

2335
01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:27.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

2336
01:44:27.531 --> 01:44:29.030
<v Speaker 4>And they say like a lot of that,</v>

2337
01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:32.340
<v Speaker 3>a lot of serotonin levels are based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>

2338
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:34.220
<v Speaker 3>That early shit</v>

2339
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:36.200
<v Speaker 4>can only.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It only makes sense.</v>

2340
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:41.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It only makes sense that your brain is </v>

2341
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:42.980
<v Speaker 4>programmed based on the experiences that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to deal with.</v>

2342
01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:44.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if you're dealing with,</v>

2343
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:47.510
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the things they sAy about </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely violent neighborhoods.</v>

2344
01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:50.960
<v Speaker 4>Kids that grow up in violent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like michael irvin was telling me this,</v>

2345
01:44:51.170 --> 01:44:54.590
<v Speaker 4>the kids that grow up in violent </v>
<v Speaker 4>families and around violence,</v>

2346
01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:59.740
<v Speaker 4>tHey'd literally from the womb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mother as she's dealing with high </v>

2347
01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:00.740
<v Speaker 4>cortisol levels and stress levels and </v>
<v Speaker 4>adrenaline.</v>

2348
01:45:00.741 --> 01:45:05.741
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The mother is programming the child </v>

2349
01:45:05.741 --> 01:45:05.741
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the time it's inside of our body to</v>

2350
01:45:05.741 --> 01:45:10.511
<v Speaker 4>be more reactive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to explode till I feel like cortisol at </v>

2351
01:45:10.511 --> 01:45:11.730
<v Speaker 4>an early age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like killed serotonin.</v>

2352
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:14.390
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could be making that up,</v>

2353
01:45:14.391 --> 01:45:16.510
<v Speaker 4>but it sounds right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So d,</v>

2354
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:21.550
<v Speaker 4>would you categorize what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>by having these experiences with </v>

2355
01:45:21.981 --> 01:45:25.150
<v Speaker 4>ketamine?</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a rewiring do you think you read?</v>

2356
01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:27.380
<v Speaker 4>So that's what you're saying earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think I'm cRazy,</v>

2357
01:45:27.410 --> 01:45:30.380
<v Speaker 4>but there have been times in the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>week,</v>

2358
01:45:31.130 --> 01:45:36.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I can feel my brain physically not</v>

2359
01:45:36.571 --> 01:45:40.070
<v Speaker 3>moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like adjusting,</v>

2360
01:45:40.090 --> 01:45:40.910
<v Speaker 3>dealing</v>

2361
01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:45.360
<v Speaker 4>like maybe looks like certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy was inside that area,</v>

2362
01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:46.150
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2363
01:45:46.770 --> 01:45:51.770
<v Speaker 3>He fucking knows what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like theY know about like dendrites and </v>

2364
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:53.120
<v Speaker 3>fucking and nerve endings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that shit.</v>

2365
01:45:53.121 --> 01:45:55.250
<v Speaker 3>But they don't know About.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't really know.</v>

2366
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:58.280
<v Speaker 3>They just know chemicals and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the synopsis that's.</v>

2367
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:59.990
<v Speaker 3>But they don't know exactly how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>interact.</v>

2368
01:45:59.991 --> 01:46:04.991
<v Speaker 3>Even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I felt my brain is felt different.</v>

2369
01:46:05.271 --> 01:46:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Physical and my sleep has been all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the place.</v>

2370
01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:14.020
<v Speaker 3>One night I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I woke up at six and couldn't get back </v>

2371
01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:16.811
<v Speaker 3>to sleep like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then another day I slept till like </v>

2372
01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:19.040
<v Speaker 3>11 in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2373
01:46:19.041 --> 01:46:21.530
<v Speaker 3>Or 11 and 12 like late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's been all over the place.</v>

2374
01:46:21.531 --> 01:46:24.620
<v Speaker 3>which let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's an adjustment going on.</v>

2375
01:46:24.930 --> 01:46:27.690
<v Speaker 4>Do you get sun in your bedroom?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2376
01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:29.880
<v Speaker 4>You don't sleep with curtains now </v>
<v Speaker 4>closed.</v>

2377
01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:31.680
<v Speaker 4>So when the sun comes in and you wake </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

2378
01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:32.950
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

2379
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:34.480
<v Speaker 4>Do it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're supposed to do.</v>

2380
01:46:35.290 --> 01:46:37.750
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That goes to that waking up sunshine.</v>

2381
01:46:37.751 --> 01:46:37.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2382
01:46:38.530 --> 01:46:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2383
01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:45.800
<v Speaker 3>and the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other symptom that I feel like it's </v>

2384
01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:46.290
<v Speaker 3>about as I've been writing more like </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking thank god.</v>

2385
01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:51.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you for not just writing more but </v>

2386
01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:51.760

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2388
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:55.230
<v Speaker 4>And you don't strike me as a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be lazy,</v>

2389
01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:55.700
<v Speaker 4>like not</v>

2390

<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2391
01:46:56.820 --> 01:46:58.800
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2392
01:46:58.880 --> 01:46:59.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

2393
01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:01.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I don't have an idea,</v>

2394
01:47:01.801 --> 01:47:02.700
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2395
01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:04.020
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not one of these people like,</v>

2396
01:47:04.090 --> 01:47:07.050
<v Speaker 3>nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something funny about the sky,</v>

2397
01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:10.530
<v Speaker 3>like let's figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of how it's been for me.</v>

2398
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.010
<v Speaker 4>I draw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I write entries,</v>

2399
01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:18.380
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like blog entries or essaYs and then I </v>

2400
01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:19.910
<v Speaker 4>extract funny ideas from what I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing that I feel like if I sit down and</v>

2401
01:47:19.911 --> 01:47:21.710
<v Speaker 4>just try to write joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>joke jokes,</v>

2402
01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:25.040
<v Speaker 4>it's not my style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the most effective way.</v>

2403
01:47:25.041 --> 01:47:28.920
<v Speaker 4>Like I create a lot of like a pulp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of nonsense.</v>

2404
01:47:29.130 --> 01:47:34.130
<v Speaker 4>Don't fucking tell me about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have accepted that as a part of </v>

2405
01:47:34.130 --> 01:47:34.950
<v Speaker 4>the process that like mining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2406
01:47:34.970 --> 01:47:37.250
<v Speaker 4>LIke you don't just tap into a mountain </v>
<v Speaker 4>and go,</v>

2407
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:38.600
<v Speaker 4>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all gold,</v>

2408
01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:42.500
<v Speaker 4>no gold mixed in with rock and bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you got to find it.</v>

2409
01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:47.590
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think some people are just better at </v>

2410
01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:48.170
<v Speaker 4>distilling their shit or they are shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to the more distilled.</v>

2411
01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:51.110
<v Speaker 4>But don't you think though that for me </v>
<v Speaker 4>at least,</v>

2412
01:47:51.111 --> 01:47:54.290
<v Speaker 4>almost all of it sucks until I bring it </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the stage.</v>

2413
01:47:54.530 --> 01:47:57.200
<v Speaker 4>Like almost I have to find out what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>really is.</v>

2414
01:47:57.290 --> 01:48:00.290
<v Speaker 4>I have to like push it out in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2415
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:04.140
<v Speaker 4>I got this new bit that I worked out </v>
<v Speaker 4>last night for the first time ever died,</v>

2416
01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:06.650
<v Speaker 4>ice house and as I was working in I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2417
01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:07.790
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>finally.</v>

2418
01:48:07.791 --> 01:48:10.160
<v Speaker 4>I know because I didn't know like </v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

2419
01:48:10.161 --> 01:48:11.600
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there something in this?</v>

2420
01:48:11.650 --> 01:48:13.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if there's anything in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

2421
01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:15.110
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing about comedy is you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>never sure.</v>

2422
01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:16.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never fucking sure.</v>

2423
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:19.510
<v Speaker 4>So I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I literally go on with this guy.</v>

2424
01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:20.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2425
01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:25.510
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you ask me to bet I'd lose money a </v>

2426
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:28.961
<v Speaker 4>lot and then sometimes it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>tagline as the funniest guy in the huge </v>

2427
01:48:28.961 --> 01:48:30.160
<v Speaker 4>laugh and you're lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh all right.</v>

2428
01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:31.910
<v Speaker 4>Or a throwaway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll set it.</v>

2429
01:48:34.490 --> 01:48:37.310
<v Speaker 4>Taking the credit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take the current figure was where I</v>

2430
01:48:37.311 --> 01:48:40.090
<v Speaker 4>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that that attitude that,</v>

2431
01:48:40.091 --> 01:48:45.091
<v Speaker 4>that thinking about the credit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what we're talking about before </v>

2432
01:48:45.091 --> 01:48:48.250
<v Speaker 4>that was the boost that you got was you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would get ego and you would get </v>

2433
01:48:48.250 --> 01:48:48.250
<v Speaker 4>adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't get the joy.</v>

2434
01:48:48.250 --> 01:48:50.840
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that it's detrimental to </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on the credit?</v>

2435
01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:53.770
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that it's better to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a state?</v>

2436
01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:55.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's the thing of like,</v>

2437
01:48:55.121 --> 01:48:55.220
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

2438
01:48:55.230 --> 01:48:57.900
<v Speaker 3>the thing I've said on here before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when me and david did the show,</v>

2439
01:48:57.901 --> 01:49:01.050
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't tell people who wrote what </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause it was like,</v>

2440
01:49:01.290 --> 01:49:03.870
<v Speaker 3>it's none of your business because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to use it to judge.</v>

2441
01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:05.790
<v Speaker 3>The person didn't write it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who didn't come up with it.</v>

2442
01:49:05.791 --> 01:49:07.170
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

2443
01:49:07.171 --> 01:49:07.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2444
01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:13.380
<v Speaker 3>for whenever I'm with a group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm writing in a room,</v>

2445
01:49:14.610 --> 01:49:19.610
<v Speaker 3>my feeling is generally how it works </v>
<v Speaker 3>with me is I don't pitch anything for </v>

2446
01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:22.660
<v Speaker 3>awhile upfront and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2447
01:49:22.661 --> 01:49:24.140
<v Speaker 3>you fucking pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pissed.</v>

2448
01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:29.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then by the end I've either caught </v>

2449
01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:30.510
<v Speaker 3>up or beat most of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like because I,</v>

2450
01:49:31.710 --> 01:49:33.630
<v Speaker 3>I just want to contribute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I meAn?</v>

2451
01:49:33.631 --> 01:49:35.730
<v Speaker 3>Like just I just want to contribute to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right.</v>

2452
01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:37.920
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea,</v>

2453
01:49:37.921 --> 01:49:39.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't get to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>

2454
01:49:39.630 --> 01:49:44.630
<v Speaker 3>I want to hold my own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not like I'm going to fucking </v>

2455
01:49:44.630 --> 01:49:45.270
<v Speaker 3>vanquish these motherfuckers because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's comedy.</v>

2456
01:49:45.271 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's silly and like how you </v>
<v Speaker 3>come up</v>

2457
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:52.600
<v Speaker 1>with it as come so communal that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in that sense,</v>

2458
01:49:52.601 --> 01:49:55.060
<v Speaker 1>but I'm talking about in the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually writing things for you,</v>

2459
01:49:55.090 --> 01:49:57.010
<v Speaker 1>for you on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not in the writer's room.</v>

2460
01:49:57.011 --> 01:49:58.450
<v Speaker 1>We write for a sitcom or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2461
01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:01.750
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about like you coming up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the tagline out of nowhere and go,</v>

2462
01:50:01.751 --> 01:50:02.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it.</v>

2463
01:50:02.531 --> 01:50:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I still want credit for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2464
01:50:05.110 --> 01:50:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm joking about it in that.</v>

2465
01:50:07.570 --> 01:50:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's like the ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

2466
01:50:09.761 --> 01:50:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that was thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the guy who invents,</v>

2467
01:50:13.150 --> 01:50:14.950
<v Speaker 1>that happens a lot with pharmaceuticals </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

2468
01:50:15.190 --> 01:50:17.570
<v Speaker 1>They think it's for high blood pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it ends up being for,</v>

2469
01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:18.980
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2470
01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

2471
01:50:20.891 --> 01:50:25.891
<v Speaker 1>oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I Don't whether the credit thing I </v>

2472
01:50:25.891 --> 01:50:26.740
<v Speaker 1>don't get too hung up with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like glad that I came up with it,</v>

2473
01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:27.790
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were.</v>

2474
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:30.070
<v Speaker 1>There's such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2475
01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:32.650
<v Speaker 1>chaff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just fucking nothing.</v>

2476
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's what's nice is when you </v>

2477
01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:40.801
<v Speaker 1>have a thought or like a long held idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>about something and then eight years </v>

2478
01:50:41.981 --> 01:50:43.740
<v Speaker 1>later you come with a joke for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2479
01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And for me also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I find puzzle pieces and they,</v>

2480
01:50:47.591 --> 01:50:50.620
<v Speaker 1>they're like little islands and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect,</v>

2481
01:50:50.621 --> 01:50:53.260
<v Speaker 1>click together and they have a bridge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they become awesome.</v>

2482
01:50:53.290 --> 01:50:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I know where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

2483
01:50:55.001 --> 01:50:58.090
<v Speaker 1>you puzzle buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on now you're exciting.</v>

2484
01:50:58.091 --> 01:50:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Now you're a part of a little little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2485
01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>YeS.</v>

2486
01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Not an island anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2487
01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Because after a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have enough bits in your act,</v>

2488
01:51:05.591 --> 01:51:09.070
<v Speaker 1>if you have like five or six ideas or </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight or whatever,</v>

2489
01:51:09.370 --> 01:51:14.370
<v Speaker 1>then you can just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll just end up filling up those </v>

2490
01:51:14.370 --> 01:51:15.190
<v Speaker 1>eight more than like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to come with two more.</v>

2491
01:51:15.550 --> 01:51:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Just like the eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get longer.</v>

2492
01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:19.270
<v Speaker 1>With this little puzzle pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2493
01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:24.480
<v Speaker 1>after doing these six treatments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you anticipate this being like a </v>

2494
01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:26.280
<v Speaker 1>quarterly thing that you do to just keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2495
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:31.310
<v Speaker 1>your brain charts in the state told me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a guy who does it once a </v>

2496
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:35.430
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether he feels like it needs it or </v>

2497
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.430
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2498
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.680
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say it's 600 bucks a treatment.</v>

2499
01:51:36.130 --> 01:51:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2500
01:51:37.210 --> 01:51:38.040
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2501
01:51:38.530 --> 01:51:40.780
<v Speaker 1>So you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the way,</v>

2502
01:51:40.781 --> 01:51:42.370
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 3,500</v>

2503
01:51:42.371 --> 01:51:42.910
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2504
01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you name your price if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to work,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll give you half my life saving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

2506
01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:49.510
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2507
01:51:49.511 --> 01:51:53.110
<v Speaker 1>it's none of this shit means anything if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not happy.</v>

2508
01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an artist,</v>

2509
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:57.760
<v Speaker 1>as someone who is more productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're happy.</v>

2510
01:51:57.761 --> 01:51:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth a shitload of money.</v>

2511
01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 100 percent true.</v>

2512
01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:03.970
<v Speaker 1>And also more productive when your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain's working properly.</v>

2513
01:52:04.030 --> 01:52:05.920
<v Speaker 1>How long has this gentleman been doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

2514
01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't ask,</v>

2515

<v Speaker 1>but he has one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anesthesiologists,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The first thing I said when I came out </v>

2521
01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:24.640
<v Speaker 1>of the trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2522
01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe the fda approved that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did they know?</v>

2523
01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:27.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2524
01:52:27.850 --> 01:52:30.010
<v Speaker 1>cause it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he said,</v>

2525
01:52:30.011 --> 01:52:35.011
<v Speaker 1>it's like 70 to 80 percent of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that works with the depression with,</v>

2526
01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:38.230
<v Speaker 1>with persistent depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like persistent,</v>

2527
01:52:38.231 --> 01:52:41.500
<v Speaker 1>kind of mildly untreatable depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if people aren't depressed?</v>

2528
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:43.510
<v Speaker 1>What about a guy like me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2529
01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno know,</v>

2530
01:52:46.210 --> 01:52:49.730
<v Speaker 4>continue the monkey in which you fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>neurology there.</v>

2531
01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:51.200
<v Speaker 4>Yogan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they might,</v>

2532
01:52:51.201 --> 01:52:56.201
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it'll fucks me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it will fuck you up </v>

2533
01:52:56.201 --> 01:52:56.201
<v Speaker 4>anymore than dmt or flipped me over </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2534
01:52:56.201 --> 01:52:58.730
<v Speaker 4>I was scared or anything I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do iowasca.</v>

2535
01:52:58.990 --> 01:53:01.460
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the more I read about it,</v>

2536
01:53:01.461 --> 01:53:02.150
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eh.</v>

2537
01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:08.080
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's my really throwing up for hours </v>

2538
01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:10.700
<v Speaker 4>and fighting diarrhea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it alSo seemed like nebulous in</v>

2539
01:53:10.701 --> 01:53:11.960
<v Speaker 4>terms of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

2540
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:14.330
<v Speaker 4>that what happens or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've only done dmt.</v>

2541
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:19.390
<v Speaker 4>I've done the pure extract,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what would iowasca is a slow </v>

2542
01:53:19.390 --> 01:53:21.290
<v Speaker 4>release version of dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2543
01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:23.900
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is with dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2544
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:27.310
<v Speaker 4>they get it down to this freebase form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just essentially they,</v>

2545
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:32.350
<v Speaker 4>they process it down to the rock </v>
<v Speaker 4>crystals and you smoke that and you get </v>

2546
01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:34.160
<v Speaker 4>pure dmt or the way rick strassman did </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2547
01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:39.490
<v Speaker 4>Rick strassman finally we rescheduled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His health is doing much better and </v>

2548
01:53:39.490 --> 01:53:41.660
<v Speaker 4>he'll be here on august thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to be here in august.</v>

2549
01:53:42.230 --> 01:53:43.370
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2550
01:53:43.371 --> 01:53:46.580
<v Speaker 4>but he wrote a great book called dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the spirit molecule.</v>

2551
01:53:46.581 --> 01:53:47.720
<v Speaker 4>It's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made a documentary,</v>

2552
01:53:47.721 --> 01:53:48.380
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2553
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:50.920
<v Speaker 4>And I hosted the documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in my queue.</v>

2554
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:51.410
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2555
01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:53.960
<v Speaker 4>we'll go watch a beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2556
01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:55.310
<v Speaker 4>and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

2557
01:53:55.420 --> 01:54:00.420
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it means you're connected to rick's </v>

2558
01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:02.831
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was a lot of other experts and </v>

2559
01:54:02.831 --> 01:54:05.051
<v Speaker 4>dennis mckenna on a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>people interviewed talking about the </v>

2560
01:54:05.051 --> 01:54:05.930
<v Speaker 4>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what he found,</v>

2561
01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:08.840
<v Speaker 4>he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is all fda approved as well.</v>

2562
01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:11.960
<v Speaker 4>And if they did these trials out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>university of New Mexico where they gave</v>

2563
01:54:11.961 --> 01:54:16.961
<v Speaker 4>people intravenous dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is just like they're doing the </v>

2564
01:54:16.961 --> 01:54:17.280
<v Speaker 4>intravenous ketamine with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2565
01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:22.540
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right into the bloodstream and longterm </v>

2566
01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:22.810
<v Speaker 4>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like your experience.</v>

2567
01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:25.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a 45 minute trip as opposed to</v>

2568
01:54:25.341 --> 01:54:26.760
<v Speaker 4>dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like 50 weed.</v>

2569
01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:28.850
<v Speaker 4>You smoke it rather,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like 15 minutes.</v>

2570
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:32.030
<v Speaker 4>So the aiw osca,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they've done is they've figured out</v>

2571
01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:37.031
<v Speaker 4>a way to have dmt and mao inhibitor and </v>
<v Speaker 4>natural mao inhibitor because monoamine </v>

2572
01:54:38.271 --> 01:54:41.330
<v Speaker 4>oxidase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is mao dissolve dmt in the gut.</v>

2573
01:54:41.331 --> 01:54:43.970
<v Speaker 4>So if you try to take it orally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body just breaks it down.</v>

2574
01:54:43.971 --> 01:54:48.971
<v Speaker 4>And one of the reasons for that is a dmt</v>
<v Speaker 4>exists in so many different plants that </v>

2575
01:54:48.971 --> 01:54:52.230
<v Speaker 4>it was just orally active on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would get high every time you get no</v>

2576
01:54:52.250 --> 01:54:54.170
<v Speaker 4>salad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will you be tripping your balls off,</v>

2577
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:55.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

2578
01:54:55.130 --> 01:54:57.500
<v Speaker 4>it would be edible and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd be freaking out.</v>

2579
01:54:57.501 --> 01:55:02.501
<v Speaker 4>You're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your neurotransmitter levels would go </v>

2580
01:55:02.501 --> 01:55:02.501
<v Speaker 4>through the fucking roof every time you </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat vegetables.</v>

2581
01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:07.490
<v Speaker 4>So he um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they figured out how to do it with,</v>

2582
01:55:07.590 --> 01:55:09.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't know in a hospital setting,</v>

2583
01:55:09.951 --> 01:55:12.160
<v Speaker 4>just like sort of a year to a doctor's </v>
<v Speaker 4>office setting.</v>

2584
01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:15.800
<v Speaker 4>So like what you're doing and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had know really,</v>

2585
01:55:15.801 --> 01:55:20.801
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really profound results with it to the </v>

2586
01:55:20.801 --> 01:55:23.120
<v Speaker 4>point where it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really life changing shit for the people</v>

2587
01:55:23.121 --> 01:55:24.160
<v Speaker 4>that were a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2588
01:55:24.210 --> 01:55:26.470
<v Speaker 4>because it's just like a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like having a law.</v>

2589
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:27.050
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2590
01:55:27.051 --> 01:55:29.510
<v Speaker 4>when you'd see boxers working with like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a weighted vest,</v>

2591
01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:35.100
<v Speaker 4>take the vesta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's what you feel like after you </v>

2592
01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:35.100
<v Speaker 4>got out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2593
01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:35.100
<v Speaker 4>Take the vest off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>YeAh.</v>

2594
01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:36.950
<v Speaker 4>And he took the vest off more and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>every time you did it.</v>

2595
01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:38.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the sixth one,</v>

2596
01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:43.900
<v Speaker 4>after the sixth one's over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Describe what it's like the next day </v>

<v Speaker 3>The um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I've never had a runner's high.</v>

2680
01:59:11.490 --> 01:59:14.360
<v Speaker 4>The fuck you talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll require sarah town.</v>

2681
01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:17.440

<v Speaker 4>runner's high too.</v>

2682
01:59:17.441 --> 01:59:19.410
<v Speaker 4>You've got to be exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2683
01:59:20.250 --> 01:59:21.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a.</v>

2684
01:59:21.851 --> 01:59:24.670
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember what the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the mechanIsm is,</v>

2685
01:59:24.671 --> 01:59:25.390
<v Speaker 4>why you get it.</v>

2686
01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:28.270
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of those things where your</v>
<v Speaker 4>body thinks you're dying or something.</v>

2687
01:59:28.570 --> 01:59:33.570
<v Speaker 4>My buddy cameron hanes just ran a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking 24 hour run a mile track.</v>

2688
01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:36.940
<v Speaker 4>Twenty four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did 106 laps.</v>

2689
01:59:37.330 --> 01:59:41.740
<v Speaker 4>He ran 106 miles in 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His legs swelled up twice.</v>

2690
01:59:41.741 --> 01:59:44.710
<v Speaker 4>Their size.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Feet are fucking bleed.</v>

2691
01:59:44.711 --> 01:59:48.460
<v Speaker 4>He said videos on instagram of him than </v>
<v Speaker 4>popping these,</v>

2692
01:59:48.461 --> 01:59:50.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blood volcanoes and his feet pop.</v>

2693
01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:55.920
<v Speaker 4>It squirts up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did he do it for it to be an </v>

2694
01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:57.920
<v Speaker 4>asshole so that everybody knows that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>can run 100 miles.</v>

2695
01:59:57.940 --> 01:59:59.500
<v Speaker 4>Body hoped out afterward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2696
01:59:59.501 --> 02:00:01.270
<v Speaker 4>I guess we're a hope now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>

2697
02:00:01.271 --> 02:00:03.550
<v Speaker 4>Let's hook up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He pushes himself.</v>

2698
02:00:03.551 --> 02:00:05.440
<v Speaker 4>He's really into pushing himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2699
02:00:05.441 --> 02:00:07.510
<v Speaker 4>like testing is meant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mental toughness.</v>

2700
02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:10.720
<v Speaker 4>Testing is his mental boundaries because</v>
<v Speaker 4>he ran 100,</v>

2701
02:00:10.721 --> 02:00:13.750
<v Speaker 4>six miles fucking psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's crazy.</v>

2702
02:00:14.650 --> 02:00:17.620
<v Speaker 4>He's a professional bowhunter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a crazy guy.</v>

2703
02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:19.120
<v Speaker 4>Was it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He saId no more.</v>

2704
02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:24.240
<v Speaker 4>He regularly throws a hundred and 35 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pound rock and his backpack and climbs </v>

2705
02:00:24.731 --> 02:00:29.731
<v Speaker 4>up hills to simulate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look what it's like the pack out meat </v>

2706
02:00:29.731 --> 02:00:31.100
<v Speaker 4>when you're hunting because you got to </v>
<v Speaker 4>these mountain hunters.</v>

2707
02:00:31.190 --> 02:00:36.190
<v Speaker 4>Mountain hunting is incredibly difficult</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do physically when you did.</v>

2708
02:00:36.670 --> 02:00:41.670
<v Speaker 4>I've done it a couple times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the climbing up was the most </v>

2709
02:00:41.670 --> 02:00:41.710
<v Speaker 4>shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how tireD you get.</v>

2710
02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:43.780
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I work out all the time.</v>

2711
02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:46.080
<v Speaker 4>I'll climb that mountain bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he goes,</v>

2712
02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:48.530
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy fuck you if you.</v>

2713
02:00:48.620 --> 02:00:51.880
<v Speaker 4>If you're not doing thAt specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like constantly climbing,</v>

2714
02:00:52.150 --> 02:00:57.150
<v Speaker 4>you get fucking exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he gets an [inaudible] and then you </v>

2715
02:00:57.150 --> 02:00:58.040
<v Speaker 4>miss out on opportunities and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>professional.</v>

2716
02:00:58.041 --> 02:00:59.380
<v Speaker 4>That's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he does it.</v>

2717
02:00:59.630 --> 02:01:04.630
<v Speaker 4>He gets in shape literally for that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then along the way got addicted to </v>

2718
02:01:04.630 --> 02:01:05.050
<v Speaker 4>getting in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2719
02:01:05.050 --> 02:01:08.700
<v Speaker 4>And then you get addicted to results and</v>
<v Speaker 4>addicted to perform them came to new.</v>

2720
02:01:09.490 --> 02:01:14.490
<v Speaker 4>The other thing I was going to mention </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the sense taking the ketamine.</v>

2721
02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:18.050
<v Speaker 4>My recall has gotten better memory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2722
02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:23.240
<v Speaker 4>Because that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing that is sort of an unsung </v>

2723
02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:24.230
<v Speaker 4>about depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It fucks your memory up.</v>

2724
02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:26.830
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't recall words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2725
02:01:26.831 --> 02:01:31.831
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense because memories </v>
<v Speaker 4>increased by upping your </v>

2726
02:01:31.831 --> 02:01:31.831
<v Speaker 4>neurotransmitters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2727
02:01:31.831 --> 02:01:36.300
<v Speaker 4>When you take nootropics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the things that we found </v>

2728
02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:36.300
<v Speaker 4>when we did the double blind placebo </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies on,</v>

2729
02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:39.230
<v Speaker 4>at the boston center for memory with um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alpha brain.</v>

2730
02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 4>Was that one of the</v>

2731
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:42.410
<v Speaker 2>big markers that had increased in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>memory,</v>

2732
02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:45.710
<v Speaker 2>memory and even reaction time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>executive function,</v>

2733
02:01:45.711 --> 02:01:46.500
<v Speaker 2>all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2734
02:01:46.590 --> 02:01:48.860
<v Speaker 2>You attaching to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the,</v>

2735
02:01:48.861 --> 02:01:53.861
<v Speaker 2>the opposite of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were attaching to depressing this </v>

2736
02:01:53.861 --> 02:01:54.240
<v Speaker 2>slowness is drag this weight.</v>

2737
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:56.130
<v Speaker 3>Yet the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last night,</v>

2738
02:01:56.180 --> 02:02:01.180
<v Speaker 3>last two nights when I've been at clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember everyone's name normally.</v>

2739
02:02:01.201 --> 02:02:01.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2740
02:02:02.230 --> 02:02:04.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I know your name.</v>

2741
02:02:04.291 --> 02:02:09.291
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't tell you what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I could see their name next to </v>

2742
02:02:09.291 --> 02:02:09.980
<v Speaker 3>their face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2743
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:15.430
<v Speaker 3>switch again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the weird thing that you don't </v>

2744
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.430
<v Speaker 3>think about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when it happened,</v>

2745
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.630
<v Speaker 3>like fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2746
02:02:15.631 --> 02:02:17.310
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought my memory's fucked up.</v>

2747
02:02:17.470 --> 02:02:22.470
<v Speaker 2>If I couldn't remember how.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the way you treat people,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Because it's not about the product.</v>

2832
02:05:52.011 --> 02:05:53.610
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't been about the product and </v>

<v Speaker 1>something that's an actual solution.</v>

2918
02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:38.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That at least in this one run I've had,</v>

2919
02:09:38.570 --> 02:09:43.570
<v Speaker 1>have had people have um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have people had an issue similar to way </v>

2920
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:47.600
<v Speaker 1>you were saying that these ssri is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would work for a little while,</v>

2921
02:09:47.650 --> 02:09:48.520
<v Speaker 1>then they stop working.</v>

2922
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Have people had an issue with like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>with ketamine?</v>

2923
02:09:51.170 --> 02:09:56.170
<v Speaker 1>I think they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my feeling personally is like at a </v>

2924
02:09:57.791 --> 02:10:01.600
<v Speaker 1>certain point I'll do something else but</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2925
02:10:02.110 --> 02:10:04.240
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>quitting.</v>

2926
02:10:04.241 --> 02:10:09.241
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what would have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would be like the ssri </v>

2927
02:10:09.241 --> 02:10:10.090
<v Speaker 1>thing is your eight chemicals leaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>

2928
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:13.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the withdrawal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which creates like any drug withdrawal.</v>

2929
02:10:13.121 --> 02:10:15.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just your body's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compensate.</v>

2930
02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm with this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

2932
02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:24.940
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe ketamine creates something in your</v>

2933
02:10:24.941 --> 02:10:27.220
<v Speaker 1>brain that whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

<v Speaker 1>in your brain,</v>

2937

<v Speaker 1>some shit off to the side.</v>

2939

<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like going back saturday.</v>

2946
02:10:50.690 --> 02:10:55.690
<v Speaker 1>of where your behavior is coming from </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're saying that you see their </v>

2947
02:10:55.690 --> 02:10:55.690

<v Speaker 1>I don't really see.</v>

2954

2955
02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:19.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know pov from porn as a pov shot </v>

2956
02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:22.850
<v Speaker 1>of me basically laying in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>position as I was on the bed,</v>

2957
02:11:22.851 --> 02:11:24.040
<v Speaker 1>which is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2958
02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:29.210
<v Speaker 1>sitting up in the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was just me basically at one point</v>

2959
02:11:29.211 --> 02:11:31.490
<v Speaker 1>it became like a little rollercoaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2960
02:11:31.491 --> 02:11:34.550
<v Speaker 1>but a fun kind of smooth like water </v>
<v Speaker 1>ride.</v>

2961
02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just me kind of going through </v>

2962
02:11:39.940 --> 02:11:40.410
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2964
02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:45.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

2965
02:11:45.890 --> 02:11:49.760
<v Speaker 1>and you go into it with a mindset where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to cure your depression or</v>

2966
02:11:49.761 --> 02:11:54.260
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to eliminate it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitigate it or like I didn't.</v>

2967
02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:54.920

<v Speaker 1>but I'm supposed to catch me while I'm </v>

2992
02:12:48.341 --> 02:12:50.060

<v Speaker 1>So let's say this is be under.</v>

2993
02:12:50.170 --> 02:12:51.440

<v Speaker 1>how they get cut down there.</v>

2996
02:12:55.431 --> 02:12:56.150
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2997
02:12:56.540 --> 02:12:58.970
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a nurse watching you and then</v>

2998
02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:04.120
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also use ketamine for pain </v>

2999
02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:07.211
<v Speaker 1>management.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people have had chronic pain that </v>

3000
02:13:07.211 --> 02:13:07.211
<v Speaker 1>they can't Get rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real they.</v>

3001
02:13:07.250 --> 02:13:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ketamine treatment.</v>

3002
02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Why my academy for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same fucking thing.</v>

3003
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Something's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3004
02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:16.790
<v Speaker 1>The not knowing why it's effective is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange.</v>

3005
02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the dosage,</v>

3006
02:13:18.141 --> 02:13:23.141
<v Speaker 1>my understanding is the dosage is way </v>
<v Speaker 1>less than people would take on the </v>

3007
02:13:23.141 --> 02:13:23.141
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that it's Weightless.</v>

3008
02:13:23.141 --> 02:13:27.810
<v Speaker 1>The people taking the street and I Was </v>
<v Speaker 1>still fucking tripping my balls off is,</v>

3009
02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happens on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>will the street ones they're taking,</v>

3010
02:13:31.921 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 1>they're</v>

3011
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.620
<v Speaker 4>snorting it or they're smoking it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

3012
02:13:34.621 --> 02:13:37.200
<v Speaker 4>So it's less so maybe it gets cut down </v>
<v Speaker 4>by the body.</v>

3013
02:13:37.770 --> 02:13:40.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I imagine it's getting processed by your</v>

3014
02:13:40.351 --> 02:13:41.480
<v Speaker 4>stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3015
02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:43.910

<v Speaker 4>your organs and all that jazz.</v>

3016
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:45.450
<v Speaker 4>You're just shooting it right into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>blood.</v>

3017
02:13:45.451 --> 02:13:46.950
<v Speaker 4>You probably need way less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3104
02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:27.120
<v Speaker 1>nose breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to breathe through my nose </v>

3105
02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:27.970
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like 40 or 39.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You guys got to know what to do.</v>

3111
02:17:44.170 --> 02:17:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just nice to be able to breathe </v>

3112
02:17:49.170 --> 02:17:49.180
<v Speaker 1>just to be able to breathe in your nose </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your mouth closed.</v>

3113
02:17:49.181 --> 02:17:50.960
<v Speaker 1>That was a mouth breather most of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

3114
02:17:51.350 --> 02:17:55.060
<v Speaker 1>but I apparently it's not an easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery and some people just,</v>

3115
02:17:55.061 --> 02:17:57.130
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work right on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3116
02:17:57.130 --> 02:18:02.130
<v Speaker 1>And some people grow back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing I heard you goes </v>

3117
02:18:02.130 --> 02:18:05.890
<v Speaker 1>back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it just repeats.</v>

3118
02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Know mine hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3119
02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Milo on seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's amazing.</v>

3120
02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3121
02:18:10.750 --> 02:18:15.750
<v Speaker 1>they trim your turbinates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're called those big bones </v>

3122
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:17.200
<v Speaker 1>in there and they also cut out a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>calcified blood on me.</v>

3123
02:18:17.590 --> 02:18:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3124
02:18:18.580 --> 02:18:23.410
<v Speaker 1>mine was all like they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like an extra that goes like I</v>

3125
02:18:23.411 --> 02:18:26.110
<v Speaker 1>don't think you need anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he showed he did like the x ray</v>

3126
02:18:26.590 --> 02:18:31.590
<v Speaker 1>and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was so much like cartilage or </v>

3127
02:18:31.590 --> 02:18:33.970
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like it was cinnamon buns to fit.</v>

3128
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess he took that uP,</v>

3129
02:18:36.071 --> 02:18:40.570
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't take out enough shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that there's a large percentage</v>

3130
02:18:40.571 --> 02:18:45.571
<v Speaker 1>of people that deal with block septums </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's super confident because your </v>

3131
02:18:45.571 --> 02:18:45.880
<v Speaker 1>nose is so fragile.</v>

3132
02:18:46.180 --> 02:18:51.180
<v Speaker 1>You whacked it on a door and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden it's bent and now you don't </v>

3133
02:18:51.180 --> 02:18:51.180
<v Speaker 1>breathe right for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get an operation.</v>

3134
02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:56.360
<v Speaker 1>The I've heard whether it's true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like a lot of it has to do with </v>

3135
02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:56.980
<v Speaker 1>inbreeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really have.</v>

3136
02:18:57.070 --> 02:19:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the jewish people and irish </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have fucked up noses from </v>

3137
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.070
<v Speaker 1>inbreeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3138
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you read that?</v>

02:19:03.411 --> 02:19:06.330
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think I bucket or it?</v>

3140
02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how fighters get cauliflower </v>

3141
02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:12.360
<v Speaker 1>ear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3142
02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:12.360
<v Speaker 1>rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get that with their nose as well.</v>

3143
02:19:13.150 --> 02:19:15.000
<v Speaker 1>You get it with your nose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inside of your nose.</v>

3144
02:19:15.010 --> 02:19:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inside is soft tissue inside your </v>

3145
02:19:20.010 --> 02:19:22.021
<v Speaker 1>nose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bleeds and swells and fills with blood </v>

3146
02:19:22.021 --> 02:19:24.301
<v Speaker 1>and that blood hardens and calcifies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing you can kind of get in </v>

3147
02:19:24.301 --> 02:19:28.021
<v Speaker 1>there and scrape it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to get an operation if you don't do </v>

3148
02:19:28.021 --> 02:19:28.021
<v Speaker 1>anything for cauliflower ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3149
02:19:28.021 --> 02:19:28.760
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cut,</v>

3150
02:19:28.761 --> 02:19:33.761
<v Speaker 4>the cut the ear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they flay it open and then they scrape </v>

3151
02:19:33.761 --> 02:19:37.100
<v Speaker 4>out all the calcification and stitch it </v>
<v Speaker 4>right by the ear.</v>

3152
02:19:37.220 --> 02:19:42.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just blood that becomes calcified </v>

3153
02:19:42.220 --> 02:19:45.131
<v Speaker 4>when blood leaks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you have breaks in the blood </v>

3154
02:19:45.131 --> 02:19:46.790
<v Speaker 4>vessels apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's under the surface of the skin.</v>

3155
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:52.000
<v Speaker 4>It swells up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like fills up with blood and then that </v>

3156
02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:52.070
<v Speaker 4>blood hardens and becomes like calcium.</v>

3157
02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:53.590
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3158
02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:58.690
<v Speaker 3>someone I know was telling me that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>woke up with vertigo and it turned out,</v>

3159
02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:08.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because a friend of hers had had it for </v>

3160

<v Speaker 3>months and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3161
02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:11.510

<v Speaker 3>dust in my inner ear.</v>

3162
02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:15.110
<v Speaker 3>So basicaLly if you ever wake up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>vertigo,</v>

3163
02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:20.140
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways you get rid of it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally like trying to get water out </v>

3164
02:20:20.140 --> 02:20:23.591
<v Speaker 3>of your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to just jar the dust or </v>

3165

<v Speaker 3>you're just sick of it,</v>

3207
02:22:07.110 --> 02:22:09.090
<v Speaker 3>I was just sick enough of it that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3208
02:22:09.150 --> 02:22:14.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't name the price named the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hardship because there's nothing.</v>

3209
02:22:15.330 --> 02:22:16.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm just sick of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3210
02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:18.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kudos to you for keeping.</v>

3211
02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:23.600
<v Speaker 3>Keep searching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The transcranial magnetic stimulation is</v>

3212
02:22:24.331 --> 02:22:28.380
<v Speaker 3>covered by some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With magnets on your head.</v>

3213
02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they don't know how it works,</v>

3214
02:22:30.660 --> 02:22:33.540
<v Speaker 3>but they got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was on a show the other night,</v>

3215
02:22:33.541 --> 02:22:36.330
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a science show,</v>

3216
02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:41.360
<v Speaker 3>science slash comedy show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the panelists that were scientists </v>

3217
02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:43.320
<v Speaker 3>panels over comics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A woman on the panel,</v>

3218
02:22:44.190 --> 02:22:45.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has,</v>

3219
02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:50.660
<v Speaker 3>she's involved in a magnet thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>increases people's sex drive for ever </v>

3220
02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:54.720
<v Speaker 3>fucking chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3221
02:22:55.560 --> 02:22:57.930
<v Speaker 3>Shoot magnets and your way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hornier.</v>

3222
02:22:57.970 --> 02:22:59.920
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think who?</v>

3223
02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:02.700
<v Speaker 3>But I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think men need it.</v>

3224
02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the judge fuck your life.</v>

3225
02:23:05.420 --> 02:23:06.880
<v Speaker 3>The idea is you give it to women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3226
02:23:06.930 --> 02:23:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a spanish fly and magnet </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>

3227
02:23:09.151 --> 02:23:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So while you check is asleep,</v>

3228
02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:15.740
<v Speaker 3>he put a fucking kitchen magnets out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe people online that was saying they </v>

3229
02:23:16.711 --> 02:23:17.790
<v Speaker 3>can make it at home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the,</v>

3230
02:23:17.850 --> 02:23:20.240
<v Speaker 3>not the sex one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the transcranial one.</v>

3231
02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:25.280
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's been all sorts of magnetic </v>

3232
02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:25.280
<v Speaker 3>pulse to ease depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3233
02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:26.790
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3234
02:23:26.791 --> 02:23:27.390
<v Speaker 3>What does It say?</v>

3235
02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Noninvasive procedure to help fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression called transcranial magnetic </v>

3236
02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:38.031
<v Speaker 2>stimulation or tms uses magnetic pulse </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stimulate brain cells that control </v>

3237
02:23:38.031 --> 02:23:43.011
<v Speaker 2>moot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they use that transcranial </v>

3238
02:23:43.011 --> 02:23:43.011
<v Speaker 2>stimulation for a lot of different shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3239
02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:46.500
<v Speaker 2>There Was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not magnetics but electric.</v>

3240
02:23:46.750 --> 02:23:51.750
<v Speaker 2>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had these electrodes they were </v>

3241
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.750
<v Speaker 2>attaching to people's brains that helped</v>
<v Speaker 2>them learn shit quicker.</v>

3242
02:23:51.900 --> 02:23:56.900
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of weird little hacks </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can use that helps stimulate </v>

3243
02:23:56.900 --> 02:23:59.400
<v Speaker 2>little areas of the brain that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>covered on radio lab.</v>

3244
02:23:59.401 --> 02:24:04.401
<v Speaker 2>There was a radio lab episode about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman who went through a sniper school </v>

3245
02:24:04.401 --> 02:24:05.220
<v Speaker 2>tests when I heard that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that one?</v>

3246
02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one was a main.</v>

3247
02:24:06.690 --> 02:24:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Or listen to that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one was amazing because she did it </v>

3248
02:24:11.690 --> 02:24:11.690
<v Speaker 2>and then she did it the second time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

3249
02:24:11.690 --> 02:24:12.860
<v Speaker 2>everything was in slow motion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel.</v>

3250
02:24:12.900 --> 02:24:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Felt like it only took five minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was 20 minutes later,</v>

3251
02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:18.610
<v Speaker 3>the eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A zone the zone now.</v>

3252
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:20.350
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3253
02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:21.910
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3254
02:24:22.290 --> 02:24:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I love this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that there's so many people </v>

3255
02:24:27.290 --> 02:24:29.301
<v Speaker 2>working on all these different ways to </v>
<v Speaker 2>improve the way the brain functions and </v>

3256
02:24:29.301 --> 02:24:29.310
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of still in this infancy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

3257
02:24:29.311 --> 02:24:31.550
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking with it and adding </v>
<v Speaker 2>pills.</v>

3258
02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:34.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm grateful for the shit they've done </v>
<v Speaker 3>so far.</v>

3259
02:24:34.371 --> 02:24:36.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like fucking thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even for the pills that didn't work.</v>

3260
02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3261
02:24:38.900 --> 02:24:42.320
<v Speaker 2>That's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a depression issue.</v>

3262
02:24:42.321 --> 02:24:47.321
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think I might've when I was </v>

3263
02:24:47.321 --> 02:24:47.321
<v Speaker 2>really young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have it.</v>

3264
02:24:47.321 --> 02:24:48.850
<v Speaker 2>I definitely don't have it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

3265
02:24:48.851 --> 02:24:53.851
<v Speaker 2>I sympathize with it and I know a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have had it and I know a lot </v>

3266
02:24:53.851 --> 02:24:55.490
<v Speaker 2>of people have had it and they've come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and they're much better.</v>

3267
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:56.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our fears.</v>

3268
02:24:56.331 --> 02:25:01.331
<v Speaker 2>One that I always point to ari was </v>
<v Speaker 2>severely depressed at one point in time </v>

3269
02:25:01.331 --> 02:25:02.720
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now he's just amazing.</v>

3270
02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.340
<v Speaker 2>He's happiest fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3271
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:07.070
<v Speaker 2>From what terms you think that a lot to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with it.</v>

3272
02:25:07.071 --> 02:25:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Success had a lot to do with it or he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really successful now and you know,</v>

3273
02:25:10.641 --> 02:25:12.290
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't feel like he's on the outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

3274
02:25:12.291 --> 02:25:13.970
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he felt like,</v>

3275
02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.280
<v Speaker 2>I think for awhile like that he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>being recognized,</v>

3276
02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:18.470
<v Speaker 2>he was being recognized by us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3277
02:25:18.471 --> 02:25:23.471
<v Speaker 2>like all of our friends and like crowds </v>
<v Speaker 2>would laugh at them but the industry </v>

3278
02:25:23.471 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 2>doesn't take them or he wasn't.</v>

3279
02:25:24.530 --> 02:25:27.020
<v Speaker 3>YeAh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had another brain thing over two days.</v>

3280
02:25:27.260 --> 02:25:29.270
<v Speaker 3>I think it was earlier this week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3281
02:25:29.750 --> 02:25:34.750
<v Speaker 3>where one day I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking no one cares about you and the </v>

3282
02:25:34.750 --> 02:25:37.820
<v Speaker 3>next day I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a professional gripe,</v>

3283
02:25:37.821 --> 02:25:38.680
<v Speaker 3>warm legacy field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting,</v>

3284
02:25:38.710 --> 02:25:43.710
<v Speaker 3>doing good enough it to all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the next day I had the same </v>

3285
02:25:43.710 --> 02:25:45.350
<v Speaker 3>thought and then it was followed by like</v>
<v Speaker 3>will then fight,</v>

3286
02:25:45.890 --> 02:25:46.580
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3287
02:25:47.530 --> 02:25:49.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like yeah,</v>

3288
02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:50.810
<v Speaker 3>it was like then fucking do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

3289
02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:52.790
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the day before I was just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>hopeless.</v>

3290
02:25:52.810 --> 02:25:57.810
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the thing is like one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression thinks just like learned </v>

3291
02:25:57.810 --> 02:26:01.061
<v Speaker 3>helplessness is a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that was one of the things </v>

3292
02:26:01.061 --> 02:26:03.890
<v Speaker 3>that like that was a behavioral thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's like you have to like when,</v>

3293
02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:07.520
<v Speaker 3>when mice couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they realized they couldn't get out</v>

3294
02:26:07.521 --> 02:26:09.080
<v Speaker 3>of a box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just stopped trying,</v>

3295
02:26:10.010 --> 02:26:15.010
<v Speaker 3>but then there were certain meds that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they gave I think a chemical to that </v>

3296
02:26:15.010 --> 02:26:15.010
<v Speaker 3>would keep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would like just fight,</v>

3297
02:26:15.010 --> 02:26:15.090
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

3298
02:26:15.270 --> 02:26:17.350
<v Speaker 3>fight until he died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they.</v>

3299
02:26:17.390 --> 02:26:19.070
<v Speaker 3>But that was the thing of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3300
02:26:19.250 --> 02:26:21.020
<v Speaker 3>like I wasn't getting out a month ago.</v>

3301
02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:25.000
<v Speaker 2>That learned vIctim mentality is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

3302
02:26:25.001 --> 02:26:30.001
<v Speaker 2>a groove that's like carved in people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some people it's become so </v>

3303
02:26:30.001 --> 02:26:30.760
<v Speaker 2>prominent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3304
02:26:30.930 --> 02:26:33.330
<v Speaker 2>They just automatically drop right into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3305
02:26:33.331 --> 02:26:34.630
<v Speaker 2>And then they're a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3306
02:26:34.650 --> 02:26:36.970
<v Speaker 2>And they search for that and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>use it.</v>

3307
02:26:36.971 --> 02:26:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Look for situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also use it in arguments,</v>

3308
02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:41.550
<v Speaker 2>like they become a victim in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

3309
02:26:42.060 --> 02:26:45.330
<v Speaker 2>It's super common and it's so self </v>
<v Speaker 2>defeating,</v>

3310
02:26:45.331 --> 02:26:49.650
<v Speaker 2>but so it's so enormous part of really </v>
<v Speaker 2>weak thinking.</v>

3311
02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:52.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But having said that,</v>

3312
02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:57.540
<v Speaker 3>a lot of some of week thinking is as </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical problem is fucking diabetes.</v>

3313
02:26:58.650 --> 02:26:59.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3314
02:26:59.620 --> 02:27:00.280
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3315
02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:03.010
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everybody has the same exact fuckIng</v>

3316
02:27:03.011 --> 02:27:06.700
<v Speaker 2>childhood and growing up experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your,</v>

3317
02:27:06.701 --> 02:27:11.701
<v Speaker 2>your formative experiences that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>having with it's shaping your </v>

3318
02:27:11.701 --> 02:27:14.431
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what giant percentage of them are </v>

3319
02:27:14.431 --> 02:27:17.221
<v Speaker 2>completely out of your control and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrogant is it to assume that everybody </v>

3320
02:27:17.221 --> 02:27:19.180
<v Speaker 2>had the experiences that you had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've gotten through them.</v>

3321
02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henry Rollins needs to pull themselves </v>

3322
02:27:24.420 --> 02:27:24.420
<v Speaker 2>up by their bootstraps and not fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot themselves.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he actually wrote a paper about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about people that have gone through very</v>

3340
02:28:15.581 --> 02:28:20.581
<v Speaker 2>significant operations where they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been under anesthesia for long periods </v>

<v Speaker 1>experience and pretty significant </v>

3343
02:28:27.550 --> 02:28:30.731
<v Speaker 1>depression after it's over and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it has to do with hormonal </v>

3344
02:28:30.731 --> 02:28:33.380
<v Speaker 1>imbalances that occur after these </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3372
02:29:31.310 --> 02:29:36.310

<v Speaker 1>it was on a public radio station in New </v>

3373
02:29:36.310 --> 02:29:36.500
<v Speaker 1>York and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be saying faggot and all that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3376
02:29:42.050 --> 02:29:43.260
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was talking about on,</v>

3377
02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:46.310
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on alex pod podcast and it was like,</v>

3378
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:51.790
<v Speaker 1>he went on him shortly after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he had shingles too,</v>

3379
02:29:53.180 --> 02:29:54.260
<v Speaker 1>and he was just miserable.</v>

3380
02:29:54.900 --> 02:29:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were like going in and he's </v>

3381
02:29:59.900 --> 02:29:59.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

3382
02:29:59.900 --> 02:29:59.900
<v Speaker 1>And he said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3383
02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the analogy was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

3384
02:30:00.590 --> 02:30:05.590
<v Speaker 1>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like I'd clumpy hair that I </v>

3385
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:05.960
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get a comb through and now I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could get the comfort with or something.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but some similar to that,</v>

3387
02:30:07.761 --> 02:30:10.100
<v Speaker 1>but he's kind of chubby and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3390
02:30:13.251 --> 02:30:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm taLking about letterman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>letterman,</v>

3391
02:30:15.230 --> 02:30:17.440
<v Speaker 1>letterman would talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ios podcast,</v>

3392
02:30:17.900 --> 02:30:20.420
<v Speaker 1>not on antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These podcasts.</v>

3393
02:30:20.450 --> 02:30:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3394

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3396
02:30:25.370 --> 02:30:29.150
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'd heard stories about him where he</v>

3397
02:30:29.151 --> 02:30:29.810
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3398
02:30:29.811 --> 02:30:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I'd hear stories where he wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy with the monologue.</v>

3399
02:30:32.161 --> 02:30:33.770
<v Speaker 1>And he used to be banging his head </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the wall.</v>

3400
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard that too.</v>

3401
02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:36.740
<v Speaker 1>I heard that from my friend who's his </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistant.</v>

3402
02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fucking hated everything he did.</v>

3403
02:30:39.430 --> 02:30:41.420
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the reasons why he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>

3404
02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the way it is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

3407
02:30:45.410 --> 02:30:46.970
<v Speaker 1>there was a story in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3409
02:30:52.780 --> 02:30:55.391
