1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you watch those movies and shake your head?</v>

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.211
<v Speaker 1>I like him.</v>

4
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:07.680
<v Speaker 1>I just knew I liked science fiction,</v>

5
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:07.860
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

6
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.781
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

9
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I didn't sit there.</v>

10
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I grew up with star wars.</v>

11
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>That was my,</v>

12
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.240
<v Speaker 1>when I was nine years old or some finances.</v>

13
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.213
<v Speaker 1>I'm not having this.</v>

15
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

16
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.661
<v Speaker 1>I did a,</v>

17
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>an argument with Neil,</v>

18
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.290
<v Speaker 1>the grass tight,</v>

19
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.821
<v Speaker 1>not an argument,</v>

20
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>but a debate with him about lightsabers ones cause I claimed that they're</v>

21
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:26.340
<v Speaker 1>physically the in principle there possible.</v>

22
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>and he was trying to say that they aren't,</v>

24
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>but they are what did have to loop back around cause the light's not continuing</v>

25
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 1>to like the fact that it goes to a certain distance and pauses.</v>

26
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a mirror or something,</v>

27
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:38.911
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

28
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:39.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Something that's true to be the end of it.</v>

30
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:40.621
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

31
00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

32
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.590
<v Speaker 1>So it wouldn't,</v>

33
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.830
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a different kind of light.</v>

34
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>So the only point was making is that photons,</v>

35
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>particles of light can bounce off each other.</v>

36
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>So we see that in really high energy experiments in particle accelerators.</v>

37
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>We can collide photons together.</v>

38
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>So my point was a bit of a pedantic physicist one but he's,</v>

39
00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.491
<v Speaker 1>cause he,</v>

40
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>it is true that light can bounce off.</v>

41
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>It can hit light but very,</v>

42
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:05.334
<v Speaker 1>very high energy.</v>

43
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>But when they press that button to a certain distance,</v>

44
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.523
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>

45
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.453
<v Speaker 1>that's engineering.</v>

46
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

47
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.921
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

48
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:14.754
<v Speaker 1>The distance thing,</v>

49
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>I agree mass to it.</v>

50
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

51
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>So as you're swinging it around,</v>

52
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have the leverage of a long thing.</v>

53
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>So why not make it really long?</v>

54
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause it wouldn't be difficult to swing around.</v>

55
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Like you could stab someone with a lightsaber a mile away.</v>

56
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.943
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

57
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Well I shoot a laser in it.</v>

58
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

59
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Like why,</v>

60
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>why make it so short?</v>

61
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.971
<v Speaker 1>You have to swing,</v>

62
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:40.920
<v Speaker 1>you got to be close to hitting a person with it.</v>

63
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a silly,</v>

64
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>silly design.</v>

65
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>You are picking holes correctly in the engineering.</v>

66
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:47.664
<v Speaker 1>Part of my,</v>

67
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>the only point I was making is that physics is,</v>

68
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>that we shutting is quite interesting is it light can bounce off light.</v>

69
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.221
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

70
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:57.041
<v Speaker 1>but it would have to do,</v>

71
00:01:57.041 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>it would have to be something that causes it to stop at the very end.</v>

72
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

73
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

74
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.303
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

75
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.271
<v Speaker 1>Which would be,</v>

76
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:03.691
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

77
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>you'd have a merit,</v>

78
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>but he wouldn't look cool with it if there was a no kind of thing within,</v>

79
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>which drives me crazy about star wars is not the light sabers.</v>

80
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.670
<v Speaker 1>It's the lasers when they're shooting the guns.</v>

81
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

82
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>why can I see that when I can't see bullets?</v>

83
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.920
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

84
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to be way faster than a bullet.</v>

85
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Like easy to see this because it's like George,</v>

87
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.323
<v Speaker 1>you could duck,</v>

88
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>you can get out of the way.</v>

89
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Those things,</v>

90
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.543
<v Speaker 1>they really slow.</v>

91
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm so angry.</v>

92
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I feel like this is so dumb.</v>

93
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I could go warp speed in this Millennium Falcon and travel the speed of light,</v>

94
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:36.120
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason,</v>

95
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>these lasers are so slowly you could duck out of the way of them.</v>

96
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>That's so dumb.</v>

97
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.790
<v Speaker 1>And he's not only star wars is,</v>

98
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>it's everything.</v>

99
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

100
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 2>the epigenome is quite difficult.</v>

101
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.723
<v Speaker 2>Different.</v>

102
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.720
<v Speaker 2>The epigenome is that the structure of how the DNA is looped around.</v>

103
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.770
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the chromosome,</v>

104
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:50.430
<v Speaker 2>you're not seeing the gene Amil.</v>

105
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:55.431
<v Speaker 2>It really basically saying epigenome and what w what I think is causing aging is</v>

106
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:58.160
<v Speaker 2>not that you're losing the DNA structure,</v>

107
00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 2>you're not having mutations.</v>

108
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 2>You're actually changing the epigenome,</v>

109
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:03.244
<v Speaker 2>which is the,</v>

110
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 2>the reader of the genes.</v>

111
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.303
<v Speaker 2>To put another way,</v>

112
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 2>a compact disc,</v>

113
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.763
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

114
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

115
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 2>for the young audience,</v>

116
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

117
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.821
<v Speaker 2>come back.</v>

118
00:03:10.821 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Discs are little things we used to put music on.</v>

119
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.111
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

120
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

121
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 2>these are digital information of course.</v>

122
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 2>And the reason we switched to digital in the first place is that it's very</v>

123
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 2>copyable and it doesn't wear out.</v>

124
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Whereas a,</v>

125
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 2>a cassette tape,</v>

126
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

127
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 2>people our age know that if you try to copy that a thousand times,</v>

128
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 2>there's not much left at the end.</v>

129
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 2>So that the compact disc inflammation is the genome.</v>

130
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 2>The epigenome is the reader of the CD,</v>

131
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 2>that little laser that goes around.</v>

132
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 2>And what I think is causing aging is not the loss of the digital information,</v>

133
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's the reader at the analog pot.</v>

134
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's like a cassette tape that eventually runs out.</v>

135
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.350
<v Speaker 2>So what we,</v>

136
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 2>what's going on really is that your cells are losing the ability to read the</v>

137
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 2>right genes the way they did when you were 20.</v>

138
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 2>And that's basically noise,</v>

139
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 2>informational noise that gathers over time.</v>

140
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

141
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 2>and so what we end up with when we're 80 is a compact disc or DVD that</v>

142
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 2>scratched.</v>

143
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 2>So the reader cannot read the right genes,</v>

144
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 2>the right time,</v>

145
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 2>and the cells become dysfunctional.</v>

146
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Now what we're working on is how do you Polish that CD or that DVD to get that</v>

147
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 2>information back again?</v>

148
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.241
<v Speaker 2>And if you could do that,</v>

149
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really the best way to reset your age.</v>

150
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

151
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 2>we haven't published it yet,</v>

152
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:25.691
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

153
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

154
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.370
<v Speaker 2>we're working on ways to actually reset that genome,</v>

155
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 2>actually get back the information that we once had when we were 20.</v>

156
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 2>So what is happening to the epigenome when you're going through those scanners?</v>

157
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

158
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 2>so what we found is the biggest disruptor of the epigenome is,</v>

159
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:41.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

160
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 2>a broken chromosome and DNA break.</v>

161
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know about scanners,</v>

162
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 2>that's just an abundance of caution.</v>

163
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 2>But an x ray will damage your DNA,</v>

164
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.943
<v Speaker 2>no question.</v>

165
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

166
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 2>even going out in the sun,</v>

167
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 2>we'll do a bit of that.</v>

168
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 2>And we think that the cells reaction to that break having to unwrap the DNA from</v>

169
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:00.281
<v Speaker 2>its Chromatin,</v>

170
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:01.114
<v Speaker 2>we call it,</v>

171
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.841
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

172
00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 2>and then rewrap it is what eventually disrupts the ability to read the right</v>

173
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:07.511
<v Speaker 2>gene at the right place.</v>

174
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:11.420
<v Speaker 2>So Dna damage is essentially a s a little scratch on,</v>

175
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 2>on the DVD.</v>

176
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 2>And that accumulates over time.</v>

177
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.550
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are not willing to learn how to do that because they want the</v>

178
00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:18.420
<v Speaker 1>fast track out,</v>

179
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.280
<v Speaker 1>take a drug and pass out.</v>

180
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.091
<v Speaker 1>That is the thing,</v>

181
00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:21.331
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

182
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:22.260
<v Speaker 1>They just want a pill.</v>

183
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

184
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.680
<v Speaker 1>It's very unfortunate that those things exist in that,</v>

185
00:05:25.681 --> 00:05:28.260
<v Speaker 1>that that sort of thinking is,</v>

186
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.260
<v Speaker 1>it's reinforced.</v>

188
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

189
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.721
<v Speaker 1>It's encouraged.</v>

191
00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:34.220
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

192
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

193
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.210
<v Speaker 1>all these ads and all these doctors and different people,</v>

194
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>well if you have a hard time sleeping,</v>

195
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll just write your prescription.</v>

196
00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:43.140
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing you know,</v>

197
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.090
<v Speaker 1>and I mean you look at the animal world,</v>

198
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:46.290
<v Speaker 1>like they self medicate,</v>

199
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:49.140
<v Speaker 1>they'll use clay for parasites and you know,</v>

200
00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:51.750
<v Speaker 1>dogs leak grass for stomach issues.</v>

201
00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:55.860
<v Speaker 1>And you know that I guess birds now are putting like nicotine and cigarettes and</v>

202
00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>their nests cause there's some of benefit to that and you see animals</v>

203
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 1>self-medicating,</v>

204
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 1>you see our ancestors using everything from you know,</v>

205
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 1>cannabis to Ceylon cinnamon to you know,</v>

206
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different derivatives for thousands of years.</v>

207
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like supplementation or self medication or the or the whole creation</v>

208
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>of pharmaceuticals is something that's unnatural or not acceptable human</v>

209
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:19.214
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

210
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.260
<v Speaker 1>But once you start to use it as a crutch,</v>

211
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where you run into issues like once,</v>

212
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:28.931
<v Speaker 1>once you deny the human body's ability to be able to heal itself or to be able</v>

213
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.070
<v Speaker 1>to decrease stress on its own,</v>

214
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 1>you begin to rely on these exogenous chemicals.</v>

215
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where you start playing with fire.</v>

216
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.950
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you're going to be this balance,</v>

217
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 1>chilled out person and still be a fucking world.</v>

218
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Smasher good luck with that.</v>

219
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm the farthest thing from relaxed and chill.</v>

220
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

221
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>I try to learn now,</v>

222
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.230
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

223
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 1>but when you're training and when you look,</v>

224
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a mindset that's required to beat the best guys,</v>

225
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 1>and it's not the same mindset that's required to get good to get,</v>

226
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 1>you could get good and be a chilled out,</v>

227
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:57.710
<v Speaker 1>relaxed person.</v>

228
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Like say you want to be a black belt in Jujitsu,</v>

229
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 1>that's totally possible.</v>

230
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 1>You can be really good.</v>

231
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.661
<v Speaker 1>People can go,</v>

232
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:02.871
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

233
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:03.704
<v Speaker 1>look at Mike Mann.</v>

234
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Mike has got great triangle.</v>

235
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:05.751
<v Speaker 1>Watch them raw.</v>

236
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:06.051
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

237
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:06.884
<v Speaker 1>he's really good.</v>

238
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>But if Mike wants to be the motherfucker have motherfuckers,</v>

239
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:10.600
<v Speaker 1>you better be crazy.</v>

240
00:07:10.601 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

241
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 1>you better be God damn crazy.</v>

242
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 1>You better be like Mike Tyson when he was young.</v>

243
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

244
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Be those Michael Jordan's you're talking about,</v>

245
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:17.420
<v Speaker 1>they're always thinking about it.</v>

246
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Roy Jones Jr yes.</v>

247
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.581
<v Speaker 1>All of those guys.</v>

248
00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be a fucking crazy person.</v>

249
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.573
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

250
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Roy Jones Jr played a professional basketball game the day of his fight.</v>

251
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Played a guy in a basketball game,</v>

252
00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:29.230
<v Speaker 1>did not have competitive.</v>

253
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Do any.</v>

254
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:30.563
<v Speaker 1>Just an athlete.</v>

255
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:31.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

256
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

257
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:32.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

258
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:34.790
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think there's any other way.</v>

259
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

260
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're going to win a race,</v>

261
00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 1>you're going to red line the engine because I just don't see how you're going to</v>

262
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:42.730
<v Speaker 1>beat the best guy.</v>

263
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Everybody is trying their best.</v>

264
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:45.883
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing.</v>

265
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 1>There's so much going on there.</v>

266
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could have like a really good coach so you have an advantage.</v>

267
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Technically you could have a really good group of guys you train with,</v>

268
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 1>so you have an advantage in the environment that you're training in and there's</v>

269
00:07:58.461 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 1>a lot of inspiration.</v>

270
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 1>But if you're not a fucking psychopath,</v>

271
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.753
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

272
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.600
<v Speaker 1>I know my friend Sam Harris was trying to get you guys to ban Donald Trump.</v>

273
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.740
<v Speaker 1>He was saying if the fall,</v>

274
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 1>your terms of service,</v>

275
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I just did a podcast with him actually as well.</v>

276
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.210
<v Speaker 1>It should come out today or tomorrow.</v>

277
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.953
<v Speaker 1>He's uh,</v>

278
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.470
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

279
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.110
<v Speaker 1>he's a fascinating guy.</v>

280
00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:18.651
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris.</v>

281
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I love him to death.</v>

282
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>But what he was trying to do was like saying,</v>

283
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

284
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 1>he's threatening nuclear war.</v>

285
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Like he's saying,</v>

286
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Hey Korea,</v>

287
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.280
<v Speaker 1>my bombs are bigger than your bombs.</v>

288
00:08:28.281 --> 00:08:28.611
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

289
00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:31.670
<v Speaker 1>what else does the guy have to do to get your,</v>

290
00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 1>to remove them from the platform?</v>

291
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>When you guys saw that,</v>

292
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:34.391
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

293
00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:35.810
<v Speaker 1>what was your reaction to that?</v>

294
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Was there an internal discussion about actually banning the president of United</v>

295
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.750
<v Speaker 1>States?</v>

296
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.021
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

297
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:41.854
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

298
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:43.570
<v Speaker 3>so two things there.</v>

299
00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:44.404
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

300
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.830
<v Speaker 3>it was a context that presidents of this country have you similar language in</v>

301
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:52.630
<v Speaker 3>different mediums.</v>

302
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.240
<v Speaker 3>They use it on radio,</v>

303
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 3>use it on television.</v>

304
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not just through Twitter.</v>

305
00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:00.670
<v Speaker 3>And even if you were looking at,</v>

306
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 3>you were to look at the presidency of Obama.</v>

307
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't exactly the same tone in this exact same language,</v>

308
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 3>but there were threats around the same country.</v>

309
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 3>And we have to take that context into consideration.</v>

310
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:19.070
<v Speaker 3>So the second thing is that we need the most controversial aspect of our rules</v>

311
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.310
<v Speaker 3>and our terms of services.</v>

312
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.340
<v Speaker 3>Probably this clause around public interest in newsworthiness where,</v>

313
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.493
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

314
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.970
<v Speaker 3>powerful figures are public figures,</v>

315
00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 3>might,</v>

316
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:33.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

317
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.330
<v Speaker 3>be in violation of our terms of service.</v>

318
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 3>But the tweet itself is of public interest.</v>

319
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

320
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 3>there should be a conversation around it.</v>

321
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.820
<v Speaker 3>And that is probably the thing that people disagree with the most.</v>

322
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.121
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

323
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:53.910
<v Speaker 3>and where we have a lot of internal debate,</v>

324
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.340
<v Speaker 3>but we also have some pretty hard lines.</v>

325
00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:57.690
<v Speaker 3>If we had a global leader,</v>

326
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.430
<v Speaker 3>including the president of United States,</v>

327
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 3>make a violent threat against a private individual,</v>

328
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.870
<v Speaker 3>we would take action.</v>

329
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.690
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

330
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 3>we always have to balance that with like,</v>

331
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:08.220
<v Speaker 3>is this a,</v>

332
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 3>is this something that the public has interest in it?</v>

333
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.721
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

334
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:14.790
<v Speaker 3>I believe generally the answer is yes.</v>

335
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:15.900
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be in every case,</v>

336
00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:17.070
<v Speaker 3>but generally the answer is yes,</v>

337
00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:22.071
<v Speaker 3>because we should see how our leaders think and how they act.</v>

338
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:30.990
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
