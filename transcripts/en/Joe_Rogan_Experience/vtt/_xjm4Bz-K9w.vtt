WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.180
To use stream.
Sorry for the the incredible delay.

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.110
Absolutely ridiculous.
I don't know why you people tolerate this shit.

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.160
I don't know why you people tolerate the shit and someone had totally dead.

4
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.200
Totally dead.
We have Mike stands now except for my friend John Heffron.

5
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:23.490
He's forced to hold his microphone.

6
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:25.740
Otherwise we'd you have an ungainly stand right in front of you.

7
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:30.110
I think that'd be ridiculous.
Next time we get like a stamp,
I have a stance.

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.820
I this,
I'm just gonna I'm gonna rock it out like this.

9
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:36.240
Like I'm about to bell out the last part of some song,

10
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.600
which was lead singer from creed.
Yeah.
I'm just going to be wrong.
So I'll,

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.330
I'll just go like this and this is perfect.

12
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.520
I'm probably gonna wind up holding onto the mic too.

13
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.680
Cause as a comic that seems like a natural thing.

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.300
This seems less natural to have this fucking thing in front of you,
right?
Yeah.

15
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.290
It's kind of odd.
Or those stands,

16
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:54.960
those are kind of like singer songwriter stands and we do a comedy club.

17
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.880
I am a singer song that I know,

18
00:00:56.881 --> 00:01:00.090
but well they have to use a stand like that.

19
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.640
Is there anything more fucking pretentious than a singer songwriter?
Yeah,

20
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:05.190
I've done some shitty and then you've got some shitty gigs.

21
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.730
Like if you have like,
and this is like say as a comic,

22
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:11.250
I mean I talked about this with Tom Segura as a comic,

23
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:15.000
you have to admit that most comic suck,
right?
What are the odds?
What are the uh,

24
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:19.370
the numbers rather it's like 80% suck.
There's a lot of the,
a lot of bad,
right?

25
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.020
Same as the singer songwriters.
So there's cool singer songwriters,

26
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.070
but 80% of them are fucking miserable.
Douchebag.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

27
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.230
Ladies and gentlemen,
John has fun.
Winner of last comic standing,

28
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.000
miserable douchebag.
No,
great guy.
Incorrect sir.

29
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:37.830
You're incorrect about yourself.
Uh,

30
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.280
if you haven't seen John John One a season two of last comic standing.

31
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.090
I thought it was season one cause I blocked out season one cause I was on it and

32
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:49.800
I was on it with Buddy Hackett and a buddy Hackett got mad at me and then died

33
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.220
two weeks later I was going to yell at him.
It was a creepy moment,
man.

34
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.900
I think we talked about this.
Did we talk about this?

35
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.520
Well the last time you were on,

36
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.460
but a Buddy Hackett yelled at me and I almost yelled at them back and then two

37
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:02.980
weeks later he died.
So I'm glad I didn't yet.
Okay.

38
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.450
<v 1>Do you guys know who rip torn is or rip lamp Ran Dorn Porn or whatever?</v>

39
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.130
That dude,
I just saw him today.

40
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:12.520
I had breakfast and he sat in the table next to me and just freaking everybody

41
00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:14.830
out and stuff.
What was he funny at one point?

42
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.100
I don't really know anything about him except he was always like those Hollywood

43
00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:21.970
squares dudes that's always been on like Hollywood squares back in the 70s and

44
00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:22.600
shit.
Right.

45
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.960
He was passing out flyers at Patty's and it was this really kind of just fuck

46
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.160
looks crazy.
Like he doesn't even look like him anymore.
Pretty scary.

47
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.180
How do you know it was really him?

48
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.400
Because he was passing out rip van torn like flyers.

49
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.100
<v 0>You said throw the confetti was his thing</v>

50
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.870
<v 1>on.
I'm a guy guys with it.
That guy.</v>

51
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.020
<v 0>Yeah,
but he was,
that was back when there was probably just him and Hey Brian,</v>

52
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:48.370
can you do me a favor and just shut that door.

53
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.120
And that other dude that was way gay that was on Hollywood squares.

54
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.750
Hey Samantha.
Yeah.
What is his name?
The worst impression ever.
But you know,

55
00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:01.000
that's how get an impression,
because I knew exactly what you're talking about.

56
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.470
Uh,
Charles [inaudible] Riley.
Okay.
Maybe that was not so Riley.
No,

57
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.250
that was a different guy.
It doesn't nothing.
Yeah.
This guy was also on a,
uh,

58
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.100
bewitched Samantha.
Oh yeah,
you're right.

59
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.030
He said,
no,
he's,
he goes,
fuck 10 [inaudible] guys.

60
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.170
They were like the only two or three way,
way gay guys,
whatever.

61
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:25.720
And every TV show had him on.
Yeah.
That's so true.

62
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:27.400
If you were a gay guy back then,
man,

63
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:31.140
you had to be fucking obviously gay and never talk about it.
You know,

64
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.790
they never talked about their boyfriend

65
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.110
talk about butts sacks and what they like and what they don't like.

66
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.880
They just threw confetti and you went,
you know what?

67
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:42.460
That guy's throwing confetti.
He's probably gay.
You know,

68
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:45.850
it's crazy when you stop and think about how many people were like undercover

69
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:50.050
gay back in those days like rock Hudson,
you know,
so many,

70
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:53.650
so many different God.
They just couldn't,
they couldn't be themselves.
They,

71
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.300
they didn't have that option.
It was impossible.
You know,
or you go,

72
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.070
yeah,
they didn't have that option,

73
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.870
but they could go out and go to like a gay whatever crazy club and never get

74
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:06.940
busted.
It was a volume to ever get caught.

75
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.390
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

76
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.710
the volume on now you streams over modulating cause it's over because it's so

77
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:15.910
fucking powerful now baby.
I think that readers is that guys better.
Sorry.

78
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.340
<v 0>There you go.
Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:22.341
It used to be a terrible place and not get busted though.

80
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.230
That was back in the day when you left your house,
your,

81
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.470
your wife couldn't get a hold of you until you got back home.

82
00:04:28.471 --> 00:04:32.970
So you could do gay shit.
Yeah.
So you could have a white,
how many of them are,

83
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.380
but now how many think we're upfront with their wives and said,
listen,

84
00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:40.110
you don't have to work ever again.
I'll give you a big fat house.

85
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:43.800
You drive around a nice car.
You don't have to have a job.
I've just been my life.

86
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.430
You know,
you could fuck guys.
Just keep it on the DL.
Don't get me in trouble.

87
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.190
Do you think there was that or do you think it was that's,

88
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.540
that's a difficult move though,

89
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:54.600
because you've gotta be a pretty open and honest guy to like pull that

90
00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:57.380
conversation off if your version,
I think that happens a lot.

91
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.760
I think there's a lot of beards in Hollywood.
There are,

92
00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:02.790
but how many of them know their beards?
See,
I know,

93
00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:07.791
I know a girl who was married to a guy for 10 fucking years and then it turns

94
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:08.694
out the guy was gay.

95
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.650
The guy came out 10 fucking years into their marriage and they were dating

96
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:14.484
before they were married.

97
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.660
So who knows how long they had been going on where he was just trying to keep it

98
00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:21.750
together and pretend he was heterosexual.
And finally he just,
he just came clean.

99
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.790
That's crazy shit man.
And that girl was,
I know for sure,
absolutely unaware,

100
00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:31.740
completely devastated.
Couldn't believe it.
Shocked,
blown away.
You know.

101
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.180
That's,
that's uh,
that's,
and she does a working woman.
I mean,

102
00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:39.480
she works in Hollywood.
She's a smart woman.
Pretty crazy story,
man.

103
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.970
<v 1>What I don't understand is I might gate our,
has to go off,
you know,</v>

104
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:45.160
if I'm married to somebody,
I'm with them that much.

105
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.130
And if they are really gay then I,

106
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.000
you would think you would know unless they're really stupid.

107
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.931
<v 0>Yes he would.</v>

108
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:54.931
But this woman who I know is not the most sexual person and she's very ambitious

109
00:05:56.461 --> 00:05:59.690
and she works the time and she maybe doesn't even like sex that much and maybe

110
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:02.390
every now and then he likes fucking girls.
You know,
maybe,

111
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.350
maybe he's really good at eating,
posted it,
cause he wishes he had one.
He's like,

112
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.380
if I had,
when I went to this to it,

113
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.130
but a terrible fucking gay voice,
I just threw out Josh.
So stereotypical,

114
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:16.340
I'm so embarrassed for myself.
But uh,
yeah man,
it's fucking,

115
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.270
it's gotta be real hard to,
to have that wacky gene and you know,

116
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.240
be stuck in a situation where you have to pretend that you're not,
you know,

117
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:25.130
cause you imagine if you had to pretend to be gay all the time,

118
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.830
imagine if the only way to work in Hollywood was he had to be gay.

119
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.200
So you had to run around pretending to be gay,

120
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:35.090
including dating guys and letting them fuck you.
How about that?
To add to the,

121
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.720
to the thing,
could you fucking imagine if that was the only way?

122
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.160
Could you imagine if you're a comic,
you want to make it as a comic and you,

123
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.900
the only way is if they think that you're gay,
right?

124
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.810
But it's so tempting me.
You want to be a comic so bad.

125
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:53.810
You've always wanted to be a comedian.
That's your fucking thing,
you know,

126
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:58.130
cause you imagine,
no,
Holy Shit.
You know,
we're very lucky.

127
00:06:58.131 --> 00:07:02.810
So lucky to be heterosexual.
So lucky.
So true.
I mean,

128
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:06.590
except for several of the whole,
you have to worry about babies.
That's it.

129
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.220
Gay dudes,

130
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.130
they just plug each other in the ass all day and they don't have to worry about

131
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:13.430
shit.
There's no repercussions.
The worse they get,
some sort of a disease,

132
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.020
they get the aides.
That's the worst.
But other than that,
they're just pleasure.

133
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.340
It's all pleasure,
you know,

134
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:21.890
just shooting loads and each other and having a good time.

135
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.060
I've got online last night and uh,
I was on youtube watching that r Kelly clip,

136
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.180
my new favorite clip of all time and I want them to youtube journey,

137
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.640
which is always amazing.
If you ever like,

138
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:35.240
you should the very first video and youtube,
you should write down what it is.

139
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:39.460
Yeah.
And then backtrack your mind to see how you went from r Kelly too.
Yeah.

140
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.830
Well,
I went from r Kelly to gay bears,

141
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.170
Gay Muscle bears and daddy bears these,
all these,
these videos of gay guys,

142
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.700
these hairy gay guys have online big muscular gig guys like flexing and you read

143
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:55.160
like the fucking comments and it's hilarious.

144
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:59.120
The comments are all these gay dudes going,
Oh,
already got pre-comm and like,

145
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.150
you know,
my tick got hard love just looking at that.

146
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:05.330
I can't wait to shoot on his back,
you know.
Oh,
what I would do to him.

147
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:08.630
I wish I had an older man like him to molest me and I'm like,
it's all like,

148
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:12.110
you Nana Miss Perverts.
Like everyone on the fucking thing.

149
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:17.240
They're all just disgusting.
I was on wicked perverts a site,
similar,

150
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.250
uh,
and adult site that had comments underneath the actual porn scene,

151
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:22.970
which is just shows,

152
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.880
I think it's weird as a generation thing where that a new thing.

153
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.350
I've never seen that happen.
Where you can't use trim is normal,

154
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.480
but an a porn side.
Have you ever seen it?
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:35.390
I hate the way she sucks Dick.
She hates it.
That's what it said.

156
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:35.991
There was this one.

157
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:40.580
It was this Asian girl and she was typewriting in the comments underneath was,

158
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.420
why would she be using a typewriter right now?
And it's to me,

159
00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:47.690
maybe it's just an aging,
but it's like just be happier seeing porn.

160
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.840
There's generation of guys that used to go through the weird guys trash staff to

161
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:55.530
get to Sears catalog.
We've talking about this many times,
you know,

162
00:08:55.531 --> 00:09:00.090
we're sponsoring should be happy that you have porn and you really get to create

163
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:03.120
a screen name.
By the way,
we have to mention this.
We're sponsored now,

164
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.800
sponsored by the fleshlight.
So you're that.
That's a butt hole right there,
Fella.

165
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.600
Pubic hair on.
It doesn't have to be careful.
I did not.
I'm not used this one,
sir.

166
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.590
I need to do not use the butthole one and I would not pull out the vagina one

167
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:21.040
out of respect,
the one that I have used.
I like how it's autographed.
Yeah.

168
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.730
So important.
The Vagina one's autographed to really different checks.

169
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.600
Yeah.
I think that one's like Christopher Reeves.
That's Christopher Reeves,

170
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:35.540
butthole.
Thank you.
Than I expected.
So that's the flesh.
I,

171
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.730
I've watched it by it.
If you're a masturbator I know you are.

172
00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:40.860
You've got to pick one of those up.
It's fucking fantastic.

173
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.140
The greatest masturbation tool ever invented for dudes cause for d for years do

174
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:50.880
ted nothing.
Now we have this golden 18% off on Joe's website.

175
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.000
Oh yeah.
You clicked on a link and get some,
get some money for it,

176
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.120
get some money off and you got to figure if we just go through that.

177
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.260
I've never used one.

178
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:02.820
But anything else you might use that is going to probably called shafing any and

179
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:06.150
it might,
you know what I mean?
You get a little hot spots here or there.

180
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.150
That's probably a safer thinking about that.

181
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.750
Thinking about the less open sores you're putting on your,
on your junk,

182
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.250
irritating the skin.
Look at you thinking practical lane.

183
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.700
That's the practical and I dunno what that means.

184
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.410
I know what you're fucking to put sores all over your tick.
But yes,

185
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.280
I agree with you.
Well I'm just saying some t shirts are softer than others.

186
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.980
Do you fuck your tee shirts?
So you do know.

187
00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:30.870
But I'm saying it's something just so that you know,

188
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.870
what the fuck are you saying?
Say others don't say it.
You Fuck your tee shirts?

189
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.530
No wrong with that.
I don't know if I'm fat.
Basically everything I own,

190
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.210
I fucked my bed or fuck pillows of fuck soap.
Uh,
fuck shampoo.

191
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.730
I tried to difference in your soap and shampoo and my dick got irritated ones

192
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:46.180
cause I fucked this,
uh,
this soap,

193
00:10:46.181 --> 00:10:49.440
but I didn't know it was Mrs Rogan soap and it was like for like if you have

194
00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:53.840
acne,
and I just forwarded it on my dick and beat off with it.
And then my Dick,

195
00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:58.620
oh fucking red and sore.
And I was like,
what the fuck was that shampoo?

196
00:10:58.621 --> 00:11:01.770
And then I just thought it was shampoo man.
They just say through conditioning.

197
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.730
If I smell pert,
I start to get a little bit of roast.
Wow.

198
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.080
If I hear running water APP loves dogs.
Exactly.
If I smelled her.

199
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:14.100
But I think conditioners a way better way to go to champagne bubbles where your

200
00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:18.240
blow bubbles,
that soap.
What's kind of oily?
And that's the best soap to fuck.

201
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:21.690
I think dudes don't have to worry about any of that shit when they're gay.

202
00:11:21.691 --> 00:11:24.750
They just bang each other.
I bet gay guys hardly even jerk off.

203
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.930
They're just so busy banging each other.
They can just get sex all the time.

204
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.070
I think so I think you see it at the gym.

205
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.770
You just come here and just to look and then you disappear in the steam room.

206
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.950
I used to work out a 24 hour fitness and the guy who was the manager there was

207
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:41.400
this really cool guy and he was assigned to the West Hollywood store,

208
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.520
the West Hollywood 24 hour fitness.
Cause he had a clean it up,
hold on quote,

209
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.320
cause they were having problems there because dudes were fucking there and dues

210
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.950
fuck all over the place.
They would,
they would fuck in the,

211
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.690
and they would have to go in there and hose down the sauna.

212
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.480
He said it was disgusting.
You would go in there,

213
00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:01.540
it would smell like ass and there'll be loads everywhere.

214
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.410
These guys would just bang each other and shoot loads all over the fucking
sauna.

215
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.250
And you'd go in there and literally it'd be a fucking biological biological

216
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:13.330
hazard and he had to clean all this stuff out and hose everything down.

217
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:16.530
He said he always caught dudes banging in there like,
oh,

218
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:21.400
those aren't some shape guys to buy.
Dude.
Gay gyms are like gay discos.

219
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:24.100
They might as well be nightclubs.
That's where they pick each other up.

220
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.060
When I was a,
when I was doing news radio,
I used to work out at Gold's gym,

221
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:32.580
which is on coal,
which was a total gay disco.
I mean that's all it was,

222
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.010
was just a bunch of gay dudes trying to pick each other up and they would spot

223
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:37.840
you like when you didn't need a spot,

224
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.050
they would come over and they can stand it back down with your ball's above your

225
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:44.260
head and they would like be really aggressive like the way stared at you and

226
00:12:44.261 --> 00:12:46.660
looked at you because they were used to getting their dick sucked and they did

227
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:49.510
that,
you know,
it's like that's their spot.
That's where they go,
man,

228
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.470
they're fucking freaks.
They don't have to worry about babies.
You know?

229
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.500
What was life like before the pill?
Could you imagine if we grew up being one,

230
00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:00.280
was the pill,
the 50s is that what it was?

231
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.700
Could you imagine if we grew up when there was no pill?

232
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.200
We don't even know what that's like.

233
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.380
My girlfriend was on the pill when she was 16 right when I was 16 or I was 17

234
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:12.070
she was 16 she was on the pill.

235
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.240
I don't know what it's like to be in an error when there was no pill.

236
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.440
Could you imagine how much more careful you had to be?
How trickier it had to be,

237
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.290
you know?
Yeah.

238
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:25.150
Or were guys then or are they were like kind of dudes now when you're just

239
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.750
whatever.
Out of a hundred out of a hundred people,

240
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.540
<v 1>guess how many per year?</v>

241
00:13:30.541 --> 00:13:34.590
At 100 people I get pregnant even while they're on the pill.
How many?

242
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:38.400
83% per air protected.
So it's whatever.
That's it.
Yeah.

243
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.990
<v 0>It's only 83% so 17% so 17 out of a hundred really?
Yeah.</v>

244
00:13:42.991 --> 00:13:45.300
It was just that planned parenthood the other day,
so they really said that.

245
00:13:45.301 --> 00:13:48.450
You know why?
Because show you that on that of that 17%,

246
00:13:48.451 --> 00:13:51.830
99% of those 70% are lying whores.
Yeah.

247
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.460
That's why I totally on the pill.
Yeah,
you're on the pill.
Yeah.

248
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.520
You shoot a load in there.
Now you have a baby,
right?
I have a new baby.
Oh yeah.

249
00:13:59.521 --> 00:14:02.350
How is it going?
How's your questionnaire?
Justice?
My uh,

250
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.550
Mrs Rogan gave birth on a Wednesday.

251
00:14:05.551 --> 00:14:08.940
We have a new baby and don't read the chat.
You're going to get distracted,

252
00:14:08.941 --> 00:14:12.100
son saying you're not even paying attention readings or your lost.
Sorry that.

253
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.820
Don't want to read that.
I'm just going to concentrate on the conversation.

254
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.700
I'm going to tell you not to chime in.
You don't have hair chime in.

255
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.380
Random random random dude.

256
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.040
You gave a voice to some douchebag,
some asshole out.
They look.

257
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.930
The beautiful thing about the Internet I always say is that anyone can say

258
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.630
anything.
They all are free to say whatever they want.

259
00:14:33.631 --> 00:14:36.270
But the horrible thing about the Internet is it anyone could say everything,

260
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.450
right?
They can say whatever they want.
So douche bags get to talk to.

261
00:14:39.451 --> 00:14:42.240
So you don't know what kind of group you're getting and you can't read the

262
00:14:42.241 --> 00:14:46.770
negative shit.
99% of it is going to be cool people with questions,
but that 1%,

263
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.680
you can't respond to them because then you'll be enforcing shitty behavior.
Yeah.

264
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.690
You know,
those faggots need to get a life,

265
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.910
those fucking dummies that want to come on and talk shit and they want to do it

266
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:59.100
on Twitter and they want to do it on my space and Facebook there though.

267
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.790
I had to learn the hard way that you're supposed to ignore them,
you know?
Yeah.

268
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.870
Or joke about it.
It is hard because you see him like,
fuck you.

269
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.740
But that's not even a person,
man.
That's a sad little blip of energy,

270
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:12.650
of negative energy.
I had this fucking dude,

271
00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:14.870
I should read it because it's that interesting.

272
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.490
I had this fucking dude that sent me a message about,
um,

273
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.320
the woman who,
uh,

274
00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:25.490
I had an argument with this feminist woman wants on,
um,

275
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.780
on my space and uh,
not in my space on,
um,
it,
it,

276
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.020
they put it up on Youtube.
Kevin,
Kevin Booth filmed it.

277
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:36.290
It was behind the comedy store's Lady Lydia lunch.
And I tried to be nice to her,

278
00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:39.250
but she got like super aggro with me and really do she and said she was going to

279
00:15:39.251 --> 00:15:40.220
burn me with her cigarette.

280
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.480
So I just started fucking ripping her apart and it's on youtube and this guy

281
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.700
sent me this fucking scathing.
I mean that the chick is a cunt.
Okay.

282
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.820
There's no way I would ever yell at a woman unless that woman's a con.

283
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:56.720
I mean it has to get to a a dirty,
horrible.
If that's my manager,

284
00:15:56.721 --> 00:16:01.580
I'm fucking firing them.
I swear to God.
Well,

285
00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:05.300
I got a,
yes it is.

286
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.420
I'm doing my podcast.

287
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.220
It's Wednesday.
Today's Wednesday,
Tuesday,
Tuesday,
whatever it is.

288
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:29.120
That's a real comic.
I don't even know what fucking day.
Meanwhile,

289
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.421
they were,

290
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:31.670
they were getting mad because we were talking about them in the flashlight.

291
00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:34.040
We're not allowed to talk about them anymore.
Anyway,

292
00:16:34.041 --> 00:16:38.780
so this fucking guy sent me this,
this email back.
I mean,

293
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.930
the first email he sent me was like really fucked up,

294
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:45.110
like just such a Douche bag.
That woman you bullied on Youtube.

295
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.020
Let's just listen to this.
This woman is an ass,

296
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:51.830
but Joe Rogan looks like a typical dude who would be on Jersey shore pushing and

297
00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:53.870
punching bullying woman physically.
Okay.

298
00:16:53.871 --> 00:16:56.030
I didn't bully or I told him not to touch my face.

299
00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:58.820
She touched my face and I pushed her hand away from me while,
dude,

300
00:16:58.821 --> 00:17:03.320
you're so tough,
man.
What a funny faggot you are.
Talk about mommy issues.

301
00:17:03.321 --> 00:17:06.980
Christ.
How do you live each day being such a miserable bitch?

302
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:12.110
Typical low file pig,
only other short,
ugly,

303
00:17:12.111 --> 00:17:13.880
miserable potheads with the inhale.

304
00:17:13.881 --> 00:17:18.100
Think all this fucking energy and this keeps going on and on and on and on.

305
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.420
Uneducated piece of trash.

306
00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:25.040
Instead of telling us that you wish the president would take mushroom trips,

307
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:29.660
try living life without smoking joints.
You Pothead burnout.
Fucking dumb dumb.

308
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.430
So this is obviously someone who's been to my show.

309
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.700
So cause I say the president should take mushrooms.
I've said that in my act.

310
00:17:34.701 --> 00:17:36.530
So this is obviously probably some Hackler,

311
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.620
probably some dude got jacked at one of the shows.
Um,

312
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.440
and then I sent him some message.
I think I sent him something like,
uh,

313
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.440
I said that,
hey,
this is what I said,
if that's what you got out of the video,

314
00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:51.750
then you deserve be the type of person that writes such a retarded email.

315
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.900
You have created your own reality and the sucks to be you kisses.
So that's,

316
00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.400
that's,
I said to him,
I don't know why I did it because I shouldn't have,

317
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.930
because when you do that,
what happens is you create a fucking battle,
you know,

318
00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:04.621
for no reason.

319
00:18:04.621 --> 00:18:09.621
So this fucking guy writes this thing that's like paragraphs long.

320
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.930
You're the typical jersey shore,
hostile short dude.

321
00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:16.560
You'd like to believe you are different because you move to plastic land with

322
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:20.940
the fakes.
But it just goes on and on and on and it's so fucking sad.
And I,

323
00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:22.380
I look at stuff like that and I say,

324
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.070
here's a guy that obviously not a happy person.

325
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.160
There's no way he successful Michael Jordan's not sitting around you Ustream,

326
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.030
you know,
writing letters like this or on Youtube or whatever.

327
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.540
These are all go Jordan.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?
It's done.

328
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.770
There's no winners out there.

329
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.580
Should Donald Trump stop getting on fucking my space and shit.
Not Bands.

330
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:43.460
Your bad shops.
You guys are faggots.

331
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.620
You know it's always some fucking zero.

332
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.740
But the amount of hate that someone would generate and all of it comes from them

333
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.170
not being happy with who they are.
All of it.

334
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.970
100% if they want to put out that much energy.

335
00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:01.170
I mean you could have disliked for someone and you could disagree with someone,

336
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.010
but if you're,

337
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.960
you spill out so much vial and it's about something that had nothing to do with

338
00:19:06.961 --> 00:19:07.470
you.

339
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:12.390
What you're doing is finding someone who you don't like to compare yourself to.

340
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.730
They're got something that makes you uncomfortable,

341
00:19:14.731 --> 00:19:19.710
whether it's success or looks or money or whatever the fuck it is.

342
00:19:19.711 --> 00:19:22.350
You know they're doing something you don't,
that you wish you were doing.

343
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:27.060
You know they are getting attention.
You wish you were getting.
That's all it is.

344
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.600
So you have to treat them instead of like human beings.

345
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.150
You have to treat them like these little aberrations,

346
00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:35.520
little blips of energy and you've got to learn from them.

347
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.140
So when you see some Douche bag,

348
00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:40.620
they like chimes in and says something fucked up the way you have to look at

349
00:19:40.621 --> 00:19:41.131
these people.

350
00:19:41.131 --> 00:19:45.390
And it's almost like the sad little creatures like trapped and like a,

351
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.700
like a jail of their own choosing,
you know,
so don't respond.

352
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:51.890
<v 2>Yeah.
I just got,
I just got,</v>

353
00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.380
I got an email a few days ago that literally said,
you know,

354
00:20:00.381 --> 00:20:02.270
I just saw your special on comedy central.

355
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.320
You are one of those guys where your parents must have told you you were funny

356
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.520
even though you weren't in.
And then he goes on to say,
you know,
you,
you suck.

357
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.100
You're not funny.
You'd maybe make a good weather guy,
Bubba,
bubba.

358
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:17.480
So then I saw that actually kind of funny.
You might be making good weather guy.

359
00:20:17.481 --> 00:20:19.160
I'm not saying this suck a comic,

360
00:20:19.161 --> 00:20:22.740
but I believe that if you set a storm front was coming in.
Um,

361
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.920
but then I was like,

362
00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.620
at first I got mad and wanted to respond to the guy and then I went,

363
00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:30.410
you know what,
how many emails do I get from people that were like,

364
00:20:30.411 --> 00:20:31.820
that was the greatest show ever.

365
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:36.700
And I don't even think about responding exactly that
because,

366
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.580
and,
and what's that guy's focus like?
There's not been what?
Like you just said,

367
00:20:40.581 --> 00:20:44.240
one band that I've hated so much that I went to their website,

368
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:48.250
logged in and said,
I just want to,
you'll never coming.
See,
you know,
artists,

369
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.650
<v 0>no rider,
no comic.
Never.</v>

370
00:20:50.651 --> 00:20:54.340
I've never done that to anybody online that I did.
If I didn't like their stuff,

371
00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:58.210
I didn't like it.
No.
I might comment on Twitter.
I thought that movie socks,

372
00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.073
you know,
but,

373
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.760
but writing someone like some fucking horrible scathing evil email like that,

374
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.580
that's only the second year to apply to it.

375
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.500
Their heart would check cause they were excited that,

376
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:12.220
oh and then it's on this guy that I told you that I sent that email back.

377
00:21:12.221 --> 00:21:16.390
He wrote me fucking paragraphs.
That douche bag probably spent hours of that.

378
00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:20.080
Meanwhile,
he's probably unemployed and his life's in fucking shambles.

379
00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:24.220
12 years old and he pees himself still and he has a computer and he's making fun

380
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:25.630
of all of us.
That's the prime I hate.

381
00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.430
Like I got in a fight with somebody the other day,

382
00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:31.480
I like back and forth and then I went to his myspace page and it was like a kid,

383
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.170
like he had Pokemon is one of his favorites and I'm like,
God,

384
00:21:35.171 --> 00:21:38.770
I'm even wasting time on this kid.
Well it's possible.

385
00:21:38.771 --> 00:21:41.710
It's always possible that the little teenagers,
but yeah,
the more,

386
00:21:41.711 --> 00:21:45.910
the more important thing is that what it is is it's not a person and you think

387
00:21:45.911 --> 00:21:49.960
it's a person because you know like in real life,
if someone did that to you,

388
00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:52.100
it would cause like a real situation.
You'd be like,
wow,

389
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.520
there's like some negative energy going back and forth between me and this

390
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:57.400
person,
but you're not even making physical contact with that person.

391
00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.220
So you got to learn how to like not accepted.

392
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.340
Like when shit comes in and it's like anonymous shit on the Internet,

393
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.070
you got to learn how to not accept that.
It's a difficult thing.
Right?

394
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.600
It's tricky.
This is probably the trickiest thing about being in the,
you know,

395
00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:14.320
quote unquote public eye,
you know,
is,
is dealing with all the losers,

396
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:15.940
all the fucking failures,

397
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.350
all the shitty human beings that just want to dump on people and it's easier to

398
00:22:20.351 --> 00:22:21.910
dump on people.
If you do that all day,

399
00:22:21.911 --> 00:22:25.270
then you never have to look at what's going on with your own life.
You were like,

400
00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.560
I've had a busy day short 10 bands that I hate and five comics I can't stand.

401
00:22:29.561 --> 00:22:32.200
Wow.
This guy,
I went to a youtube page two,

402
00:22:32.201 --> 00:22:35.410
which is even more hilarious because it's just filled with people shitting on

403
00:22:35.411 --> 00:22:38.050
him,
calling him an asshole.
So I guess he just does this constantly,

404
00:22:38.051 --> 00:22:42.220
just that's what he does.
Just fucks with people.
And um,
I,
I thought it was,

405
00:22:42.221 --> 00:22:43.150
it's fascinating,
man.

406
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.600
It's fascinating that there's people like that that for sure our fucking losers,

407
00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:49.780
not a single one of these guys is successful,

408
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.750
is doing what they want to be doing because if they were to be concentrating on

409
00:22:52.751 --> 00:22:55.960
that,
I don't have enough energy out there to concentrate on some other shit.

410
00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.290
I don't have any energy to go out there and try to bring someone down for no

411
00:22:59.291 --> 00:23:00.340
reason.
I don't have it.

412
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.600
I don't have it to give and if you have it to give for sure you're missing

413
00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:08.980
something in your life.
Apps a fucking lutely you miss.
It cheats us.

414
00:23:08.981 --> 00:23:11.830
I've been following a lot of Christians on,
on the Twitter lately.
Oh,

415
00:23:11.831 --> 00:23:15.940
so this brings me back to our Kelly.
Before I went,
we went gay guys,
gay guys.

416
00:23:15.941 --> 00:23:17.530
Big Bear to r Kelly.
Okay,

I got to show you this video because this is the best piece of unintentional

419
00:23:25.691 --> 00:23:30.691
comedy I've ever been a witness to its r Kelly and it's a video called real talk

420
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.640

421
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.100

432
00:24:22.611 --> 00:24:24.860

Okay.

433
00:24:24.861 --> 00:24:26.440
You gotta crank crank this up.

434
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.250
<v 2>I think it's a great song.
You know what?
This is our Kelly,</v>

435
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.030
who's my favorite unintentional black comedian.

436
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.200
How real she gives when you arguing with your girl Miss Shit,
you got upset.

437
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.040
So I did it on Youtube.
Y'All on youtube.

438
00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.920
Real talk.
Behind the scenes is what it's called on to close.

439
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.730
We got stone.
He's jumping off here.
Now what it is,

440
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:55.270
is our Kelly have any argument with this check?
Turned it into a song.

441
00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.390
I'm doing this for the fans.
It's a no,

442
00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.890
just a conversation with him and he's checking the love.
Real talk.

443
00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.540
<v 4>Calm down.
I was at a club.</v>

444
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.670
Good
man.

445
00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:20.330
Girl.
I'm not about to sit up here and argue with you about the blame

446
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.850
thing I'm trying to establish with juicing stablish right.

447
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:35.260
Meanwhile,
while he's talking to close with some model

448
00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:42.360
slogan,
intriguing and kick in the tail,
because did she say,
oh look,

449
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:47.200
I have,
but she stayed.
There were other guys there.
Well,

450
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.510
the other guys will tell me this.

451
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.650
How the fuck she know I was with them?
All the dirt.

452
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:57.430
I love how there's no point cause he's got this intelligence

453
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.210
was the other guys.
He's got a fucking rock solid.
Excuse me.

454
00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:05.670
Why are you jealous?
No Man,

455
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.800
I don't know why you fuck with all them jealous.
No Man.

456
00:26:10.801 --> 00:26:12.770
And have an assholes anyway.

457
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.000
Don't you think I got another bullshit?

458
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.750
Did Not just give you money to go get your hair tools and nails.

459
00:26:24.751 --> 00:26:27.900
Don't know the day your way for smiling.

460
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:33.820
I'm gonna have to deal with if he was out with no,
it gets better I think,

461
00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.830
Dave.
Nobody.
Nothing.
No money.

462
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:39.910
See what your problem.

463
00:26:39.911 --> 00:26:44.350
It is always running off at the mouth telling your your mother fucking

464
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.793
days.

465
00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.940
They
don't make us

466
00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:04.500

Can Watch your mouth.

467
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:11.160
This is I want you talking about are so good as bull shit.

468
00:27:11.161 --> 00:27:14.540
I'm coming home and getting my shit and get the fuck about her dog

469
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:20.190

470
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:25.260

Ooh,

471
00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.740
he's sitting.
That's the end of it.

472
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.290
<v 5>And there's like a fake fight afterwards.</v>

473
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.920
He's singing through a ghetto argument.

474
00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:52.610
What his girl and he's singing like with passion and I wish you well.

475
00:27:53.981 --> 00:27:57.990
My mother fucking clothes.
We'll talk.

476
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.200
Everybody listening next time you fight with your girl,

477
00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:06.120
you have to just throw the word.
We'll talk into the conversation.
Oh my God,

478
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:11.070
that's good.
He likes it.
He likes to pee on girls too,
which is funny.
Yes.

479
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.700
You did not see the vision.
Did he not get acquitted?
You don't want to get sued.

480
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.800
I've seen the video.
She best watch him run the,

481
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.970
he got his jacket and he got to be dazzled at the mall.
Did you see that?

482
00:28:23.971 --> 00:28:26.400
He had like this little jewels you put on cell phones all over his dad.

483
00:28:26.401 --> 00:28:30.990
I don't know why you're hanging out with all them.
No Man having assholes.
Anyway,

484
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:36.600
we'll talk.
I want to see him and easy.

485
00:28:36.601 --> 00:28:40.030
He deep kiss.
What are you talking about?
He's fucking awesome.
He's,

486
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:43.830
he is a dude out there working for you.
Okay.

487
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:48.420
That guy is providing you on the entertainment.
You don't look,

488
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.210
you might not like him.
You might think he's stupid,

489
00:28:51.211 --> 00:28:54.600
but dad was goddamn entertaining for all the wrong reasons.
Yeah,

490
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:55.740
but that was goddamn entertained.

491
00:28:55.741 --> 00:28:58.890
That easily could have been a sketch on the Chappelle show.
Oh,
it was awesome.

492
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.720
For the wrong reasons.
Yeah.
I liked his,

493
00:29:00.721 --> 00:29:03.240
wrote a thought though when the guy was like,
you were out within,
I had girls,

494
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.440
he didn't,
I buy you something yesterday.
Right.
You're happy then.
Right.
So wait,

495
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:13.440
did notice by your love the fucking pause where there's no music is,

496
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.570
did she say there were other guys there?
Did she say that were other guys,

497
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.180
I wish you would burn my clothes.

498
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.510
And it sounds like you said he was gonna shoot her then bailed and realized.

499
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:31.080
I mean some bad's going to happen to what they eat.
Don't make a shit.

500
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:35.760
That's a song.
That's genius shit.
But you know,
you could say,
let this idiot,

501
00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:36.840
this moron,
but listen,

502
00:29:36.841 --> 00:29:41.620
that guy is giving massive amounts of unintentional comedy.
Yeah.
You know

503
00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:47.230
<v 6>closet.
Yeah.
He's always been great too.
Yeah,
I love him.
Fucking hilarious.</v>

504
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.210
Trapped in the closet was one of the best ever because it was like,
what?

505
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.470
Seven parts or something like that and more than that,
like 24 ports.

506
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.770
So fucking DVD,
dude.
I got a DVD of it.

507
00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:00.440
It might be a two fucking DVD set.
I want to watch that in three D.

508
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.730
<v 7>Yeah.
I watched this all day yesterday.</v>

509
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.950
I just kept watching it over and over and over again.

510
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.920
I literally watched it 10 times.
That's awesome.
Talk.

511
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:16.620
It's genius.
Genius Shit.
All right.
Anyway,

512
00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:18.863
back to

513
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.710
<v 6>pretty Murphy's has been died.
Isn't that ridiculous?
Crazy.</v>

514
00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.040
Never figured that guy would be out there jogging the,

515
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:28.260
is it a heart attack or drugs?
Drugs.
Yeah,
that's what they're saying.
Hmm.

516
00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.730
I mean,
it ain't wheat grass juice to killed that fat.
Fuck.

517
00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.070
I mean,
look at them.
Everybody was wondering why,

518
00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.150
how that really knocks you on and what the protein drink or do.

519
00:30:40.151 --> 00:30:41.780
This is how you have to look at it.
You see

520
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.400
<v 7>guy who's that fucking fat with a movie,</v>

521
00:30:44.401 --> 00:30:48.420
Star Hottie for a wife and she's got a drug problem.
Well,

522
00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:51.600
that's where fucking drugs are coming from.
They're coming from the fat guy.
It's,

523
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.180
I mean,
it doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure that one out.

524
00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:58.320
That's pretty simple.
Yeah,
man,
that's a big problem out here,
isn't it?

525
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.250
The prescription drugs,

526
00:30:59.251 --> 00:31:04.251
drugs are a huge problem in Hollywood and prescription drugs are the most,

527
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.720
the biggest one.
That's the one that doesn't get talked about.

528
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.100
Everybody's on pills.

529
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:12.060
I can't tell you how many times someone has offered me oxies people have offered

530
00:31:12.061 --> 00:31:16.020
me vicodins people who offered me Xanax is just offering them like,

531
00:31:16.021 --> 00:31:19.050
you want some gum?
Hey,
you want a viking in you want,
you want,

532
00:31:19.051 --> 00:31:21.840
you want a prescription drug,
you want some oxies fucking yeah.

533
00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.650
<v 6>Axes where people are giving out heroin.
Whoa.</v>

534
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:31.760
Giving out any next cm,
let me know that stomach acid medication.
It's scary,
dude.

535
00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.130
It's scary.
Bring in humans

536
00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.070
<v 7>beings into this world knowing that it's just going to get more and more fucking</v>

537
00:31:37.071 --> 00:31:41.890
crazy.
So a baby Rogan number two was just pouring the other day.
And uh,

538
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:45.920
this was the craziest part of the,
the bear,
the birth process.

539
00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.140
The birth process is totally normal.
You know,

540
00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:51.530
it's all great and everything baby comes out beautiful,
everything's healthy,

541
00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.393
everyone's happy.

542
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:57.170
But when a check gives birth to a baby and the baby comes out of her pussy,

543
00:31:57.171 --> 00:32:01.160
it tears her taint.
It tears the,
the,
the line between the,

544
00:32:01.161 --> 00:32:05.360
the butthole and the VJ J and they have to so shop tainted love.

545
00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.860
So the baby comes out okay.
And the doctor has the baby.

546
00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:13.670
I cut the cord,
everything's happy,
we'd take the baby,
the baby goes to the,

547
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:18.050
to the incubator where they have to,
uh,
you know,
clean it up and all that jazz.

548
00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:21.860
So while this is all happening and the doctor starts stitching,
okay,

549
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.350
you watch wife is holding the baby.
Okay,

550
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.390
my wife's holding the baby and she's so happy,

551
00:32:26.391 --> 00:32:29.000
but she had an epidural so she's numb from the waist down.

552
00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.500
So she's got this epidural,

553
00:32:30.501 --> 00:32:34.360
she's not feeling shit and she's happy and Smiley and she's holding the baby.

554
00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:34.910
Meanwhile,

555
00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:39.910
her legs are up in the stirrups and her vagina is fucking scene from hell

556
00:32:40.391 --> 00:32:41.180
raiser.

557
00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:46.180
This dude is just hooks and pulling and hooks and pulling just fish hooks just

558
00:32:47.751 --> 00:32:51.200
digging into me and it's not like one or two times.

559
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.000
He's fucking getting in there.

560
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:56.930
He wants it tight in that shit up for me and extra for a couple more stitches.

561
00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:01.310
No,
he's doing,
he's like an old joke between men.
You know,

562
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.480
doctors are 20 but a couple of extra stitches.
But no dude,

563
00:33:05.481 --> 00:33:07.820
he is just digging in.

564
00:33:07.821 --> 00:33:12.200
But it was so surreal watching the scene because on one hand,

565
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:17.230
here's my wife with this new baby and she's super excited and there's so much

566
00:33:17.241 --> 00:33:21.990
love in the air and the baby's crying and nuzzling up with her and you know,

567
00:33:21.991 --> 00:33:25.640
and there's tears coming down her face and she's so happy and this huge smile

568
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.680
and then three feet below that is a fucking horror movie.

569
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:35.060
I mean they're just hooks,
hooks,
hooks.

570
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:40.760
Wow.
Yeah Dude.
And then she has to wear a diaper cause you know,
it's all,

571
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.310
it's blood and the whole area's a mess.

572
00:33:43.311 --> 00:33:48.311
So she's got these crazy granny panties on with this big like giant Super Maxi

573
00:33:49.161 --> 00:33:53.720
pad diaper type thing.
Stuffed nice to her pussy.
Are we doing this now?

574
00:33:53.721 --> 00:33:57.160
We're going to sit back.
I feel very uncomfortable or comfortable perspective.

575
00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.650
But you're supposed to,
everything I've read nothing I have no,

576
00:34:00.651 --> 00:34:04.480
but you're supposed to never look right as it did.
Say that.
I love that.

577
00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:10.160
No,
no,
not below the curtain.
Didn't bother me at all really the first time.

578
00:34:10.161 --> 00:34:12.500
No,
I mean it's,
it's natural man.
It's part of life.

579
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.140
And I did the stitches has come up by themselves or did they have to get,
yeah,

580
00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:19.160
absorb.
What's that?
Who passes out?
Cause even you telling that story,

581
00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:22.640
that's why lean back.
I'm like real shit dude.

582
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.020
I might pass out from is a lot of trauma.
You know,

583
00:34:27.021 --> 00:34:30.320
I thought about that the other day.
Like you know,
like a fireman or a policeman.

584
00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:32.400
They've seen way more trauma than right.
You know,
they,

585
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:36.620
they see a lot more crazy shit than I do.
But compared to the average person,

586
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:41.180
I mean almost every week I see somebody who,
but again,
Jack fucking senseless,

587
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:44.660
like almost every week I'm so oblivious to that.

588
00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:48.470
Like when I see like fights break out at clubs or something like that,

589
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:51.170
I mean I always get like,
all right,
am I want to get the fuck outta here,

590
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.770
but I never get like uncomfortable.
I'm like,
I see,

591
00:34:54.771 --> 00:34:56.540
I see this all the time.

592
00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:01.780
Like I'm always seeing broken bones and giant fucking facial gashes and blood

593
00:35:02.571 --> 00:35:03.350
everywhere.

594
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:08.350
So I'm watching this with this clinical disconnect while this guy is digging

595
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:12.700
fucking hooks.
It's like pinhead.

596
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.230
What was the one where the skin was stretched back?
That's what it's like

597
00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.510
and he's going in there and he and he had to change hoax at one time to get a

598
00:35:20.511 --> 00:35:25.160
bigger hook to go deeper because they do levels because the whole team is like

599
00:35:25.161 --> 00:35:25.994
ripped apart.

600
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:31.280
The fucking babies got my head's big fucking head baby and fucker and it just,

601
00:35:31.551 --> 00:35:35.570
reps just tears open.
Yeah,
Dude.
It's extreme shit.

602
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:38.040
And then after the baby's up,
they

603
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.820
<v 0>pull this placenta bag out and the placenta bag,
this is where the baby,</v>

604
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:45.690
you know this is the sack where the baby was living,
you know,
to eat.
No,

605
00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:50.130
they pull it out.
Do they pull it out and it's like,
it's like an alien.

606
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.540
It's like some alien creatures like an octopus was living in any girls.
Yeah.

607
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:59.490
It's funny.
Yeah.
They cook it up very strange.
Yeah.
They fry it with eggs.

608
00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.960
They fry rather like eggs.
I keep doing that,
which is probably very annoying.

609
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:07.490
Financials,
it's what?

610
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.760
Bananas or something I couldn't stop saying the other day.

611
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:15.180
Sometimes I get a word in my head like that is fucking bananas.

612
00:36:15.181 --> 00:36:19.080
And it just gets stuck and it got stuck for like the whole two hour podcasts.

613
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:25.350
So anyway,
my advice to you is,
uh,
don't look below the curtain.
You should look,

614
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.090
you should look,
you should know what the fuck is going on.
Yeah.

615
00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:33.030
Probably got to be able to handle it as a,
as a human,
as a man as
well.

616
00:36:33.031 --> 00:36:36.430
There's nothing like that.
You ever prepared for it,
you know,
so,
I mean,

617
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.240
I could probably watch fights all day long.
Well,
you,
you have a stepdaughter,

618
00:36:39.241 --> 00:36:41.580
you ever thought about shooting a live one into the message and making a,

619
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.780
making a real one.
We've never not tried,
obviously.
You know,

620
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.520
so you have tried.
Yeah,
I've never not,
you know,

621
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.530
but you've been trying to have a baby this whole time.
You were there.
What,

622
00:36:52.531 --> 00:36:56.040
five years now?
Wow.
I don't know how,
but then I'm like,
well,

623
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:58.740
I travel all the time and then I hear you.
You're knocking them out.

624
00:36:58.741 --> 00:37:02.010
Everything or,
yeah.
Well.
And I do are,
you know,
I don't,

625
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.460
I don't think I travel more than you do.
Um,
are you,
um,

626
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.180
getting your balls check during?
I got it.
Got that thing.
Whatever the number is.

627
00:37:09.181 --> 00:37:11.370
It's like 22 million is average.

628
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.120
Like I had like I was in the sixties or seventies.
So you're good.
Yeah.

629
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.290
So she's got a broken box or something or I'm never home that,

630
00:37:19.291 --> 00:37:21.450
that I don't understand.
Cause then I watch like the,

631
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:26.400
have you ever fucked her 30 days in a row?
No.
No.
Welcome to marriage,

632
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:26.971
ladies and gentlemen.

633
00:37:26.971 --> 00:37:30.880
I know all you people out there fucking girlfriend three times a day I

634
00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:37.200
got married.
Yeah it would.
Yeah,
you're gonna,

635
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:41.160
you're gonna stop fucking your wife.
So horrible for me.

636
00:37:41.161 --> 00:37:45.330
Somebody Wednesday through Sunday,
you know,
some months or less than others.

637
00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.173
<v 5>How much do you think?</v>

638
00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.550
<v 0>It's a lot,
but you want to freeze your loads.</v>

639
00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:04.310
<v 1>I'm thinking lately if it's,
if everything adds up,
why not just free sperm,</v>

640
00:38:04.311 --> 00:38:07.180
get your shit snipped and then now I have to do,

641
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.810
<v 0>you're fucking sperm gets all thought out one day,</v>

642
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:13.000
<v 1>whatever.
You put it in two separate locations,</v>

643
00:38:13.001 --> 00:38:16.630
like mom's fridge in Ohio and then some science lab in California.

644
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.260
<v 0>Okay.
I guess she's Mommy's fridge.</v>

645
00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:25.220
<v 5>I know the stem cells are babies prompts.
Fridge was shitty.</v>

646
00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:30.110
It wasn't totally frozen together to have some half.
He smells like otter pops.

647
00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:30.880
I used to have,
I have a

648
00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.360
<v 0>joke about that there's,
there was a group that was trying to take a,</v>

649
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.580
it was the second coming project.

650
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.140
They were trying to take a DNA from the shroud of turn,

651
00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:42.260
you know the shroud of Turin is supposed to be the,

652
00:38:42.261 --> 00:38:46.060
the cloth that covered Jesus and they were going to take DNA from the shroud of

653
00:38:46.061 --> 00:38:50.800
Turin and do a clone of Jesus.
They're going to make a clone and,

654
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:53.500
and give birth is clone baby.
And that would be the messiah.

655
00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.990
They would bring Jesus back to life with technology.
And I was like,

656
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:56.831
that's all well and good.

657
00:38:56.831 --> 00:38:59.650
But the technology behind cloning is not been perfected yet.

658
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:03.460
I mean like when they made Dolly the sheep Dolly's fucking dead,
you know.

659
00:39:03.461 --> 00:39:06.190
And there's a lot of things that they make that come out all fucked up and they

660
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:09.340
die.
Like what if they made a retarded Jesus?
Like that was the joke.

661
00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.360
It's like if Jesus came back and they gave birth to him,
but he had down syndrome

662
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:18.310
like would they still follow him?
He just wants to go bowling and the joke,

663
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.250
the joke was like,
he's the messiah duties,
fucking shitting his pants.

664
00:39:21.251 --> 00:39:23.320
He's drawing all over.
It might be a test.

665
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.620
It might be a test screen that joke back.
Yeah.

666
00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:28.060
Instead of turning water into wine,

667
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.840
he would turn like catch it into cookies and the cookies.

668
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.990
He drools all over his cookies and make sure nobody else eats him.

669
00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:39.430
That's what he's the messiah instead of crosses everybody be wearing helmets.

670
00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:44.110
Look bad.
If there was really,

671
00:39:44.111 --> 00:39:47.050
if they really knew for sure that they had something that had the blood of

672
00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:49.570
Christ on it and they knew that there was some technology,

673
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.990
I guarantee you there'd be some Wackos that would be convinced that that would

674
00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:54.970
be the way that Jesus,
would it be coming back.

675
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.800
It was like they were supposed to do it.
And that is how,
you know,

676
00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:01.690
it's through technology that the Christ manifest itself in this,

677
00:40:01.691 --> 00:40:03.970
in this dimension and this,
this time and era.

678
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.470
There's a lot of people that we believe that there's,

679
00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:09.700
I'm falling some guys on Twitter right now,
some creationists,

680
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:14.070
my fucking God,
their arguments are scary.
Um,

681
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.260
just listen to them talk about these.

682
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.510
I'm following dudes that think the earth is 10,000 years old and they get in

683
00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:23.650
arguments all day with people.
Their entire day is,
consisted of,

684
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.520
consists of arguing with people about the origins of the earth,

685
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.440
about how old the earth is,

686
00:40:29.441 --> 00:40:33.760
and about how complex cells are and how these things would be impossible to

687
00:40:33.761 --> 00:40:37.390
create a just random,
I love people like that.
That's when he jumped on and go,

688
00:40:37.391 --> 00:40:40.540
yeah,
Jesus was an operating system and you just fuck with him.
You know,

689
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:43.770
go crazy and just troll with them and act like you're being serious as the piss

690
00:40:43.771 --> 00:40:46.150
them off.
Do you?
Uh,
I don't act like I'm being serious.
I don't,

691
00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.850
I don't troll them either.
Most of the time I,
I just read it.
I like,

692
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.660
I like listening to people when they have the real arguments,

693
00:40:52.661 --> 00:40:53.740
when they get really angry,

694
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:57.310
like really go back and forth to each other about shit that you don't have a

695
00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:01.690
goddamn clue about.
Like you're telling me that the human eye is too complex.

696
00:41:01.691 --> 00:41:05.980
So that's why there's a god,
like really for real.
That's their argument.

697
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.200
What a nutty ass fucking argument that it's too complicated for my stupid ass.

698
00:41:11.201 --> 00:41:13.930
I don't understand how it works.
So there must be a god.

699
00:41:13.931 --> 00:41:17.530
And meanwhile they just created the first artificial cell.
Have you,

700
00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.890
did you read about that?
They made a synthetic cell.

701
00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:23.380
They made the very first synthetic cell,

702
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:28.330
which is the beginning of us creating life,
which is what supposedly God did.

703
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:33.040
Look,
if human beings evolve,
if we're,
we're at right now,

704
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.130
if we live

705
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.920
<v 7>in managed not to blow ourselves up or hit peak oil or whatever,</v>

706
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:39.290
and a hundred million years from now,
we're still here.

707
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:43.520
How much more fucking advanced are we going to be than we are right now?
I mean,

708
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.580
what we can do right now if we can make an artificial cell right now,

709
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.260
if we could put satellites into orbit,

710
00:41:48.261 --> 00:41:51.830
transmit data wirelessly across the entire planet,
instantly,

711
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:55.820
what kind of insane innovations are we going to have a million years from now,

712
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:56.930
10 million years,

713
00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.260
a hundred million years will be a undiscernible from God's will be able to

714
00:42:00.261 --> 00:42:04.310
create our own universes.
We'll be able to literally create our own dimensions,

715
00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:05.390
our own universes.

716
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:09.050
There will be scientists that figure out ways to break boundaries through this

717
00:42:09.051 --> 00:42:12.740
world and into the next fucking wormholes through space and time.

718
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:16.650
All that shit is going to happen.
You know,
all that shit is on the way.
Oh,

719
00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:20.060
100% so how the fuck do you know that that's not what there's,

720
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:23.180
there's a lot of scientists that absolutely believed that the universe that we

721
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:28.181
live in May very well be just some sort of model that's being run by some super

722
00:42:28.451 --> 00:42:33.200
intelligent being
that we literally,
we are,

723
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:36.400
we are running inside like some sort of a system though.

724
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.950
Scientists love smoking pot.
The most sciences do.
Dude,

725
00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.530
Carl Sagan was a huge pothead.

726
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.440
Why would you not be a pothead if you're a scientist?

727
00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.630
Scientists are supposed to be thinking about sitting,

728
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.840
sitting around thinking about cool shit.
Right?
Right.

729
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:53.300
Why would you not want to behind when you're thinking about cool shit?

730
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.850
Like if you watch us space,
documentary space.

731
00:42:55.851 --> 00:42:57.560
Documentaries are my favorite things to watch.

732
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:59.750
I love watching space documents cause it's just,

733
00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:01.310
they just put it all in perspective.

734
00:43:01.311 --> 00:43:05.060
Like sometimes you have to watch them two or three times to really get what

735
00:43:05.061 --> 00:43:08.480
they're saying cause it's so fucked up.
But when you watch him sober,

736
00:43:08.481 --> 00:43:13.300
they're not nearly as interesting when you watch him high on weed,
we give it,

737
00:43:13.301 --> 00:43:17.840
try it on weed.
If you do it on smoking pot and watches,
pick documentaries.

738
00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:21.950
You know Carl Sagan used to smoke weed every fucking day.
Carl Sagan,

739
00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:24.500
his thing was he would smoke pot and that's where he get his ideas from.

740
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:29.360
I mean he wrote about my signature on the broken board is all Carl Sagan sent.

741
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:30.470
You know?

742
00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.590
<v 1>Yeah.
My problem though with watching these documentaries,</v>

743
00:43:32.591 --> 00:43:36.210
like you just had me watch a documentary,
the collapse collapse,

744
00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:39.400
and my problem with these documentaries is it just takes one little thing for me

745
00:43:39.401 --> 00:43:42.730
to just get thrown off the tracks and believe in belief.
You know,

746
00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.850
<v 7>you don't have to believe in documentary,
so I don't,</v>

747
00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:49.150
I don't believe most of the documentaries I,
I listened to her watch.

748
00:43:49.151 --> 00:43:51.220
What I do is I just tried to see,

749
00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:55.330
even at this guy's wrong about a lot of shit.
Does he have points?

750
00:43:55.331 --> 00:43:58.300
Because I know a lot of people who are wrong about a lot of shit,

751
00:43:58.301 --> 00:44:01.690
but every now and then they'll say something like,
okay,
here's a perfect example,

752
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.990
Alex Jones.
Alex Jones is not right all the time.
He's just not.

753
00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:09.340
Some of the stuff that he believes is fucking crazy and I don't understand it.

754
00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:12.790
I listened to him and I see the connections that he's making when he says that

755
00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:17.410
he's got proof and we have the documents and Alex is a friend of mine and I love

756
00:44:17.411 --> 00:44:21.070
the guy but I listened to his connections and I'm like,
Oh this is a logical,

757
00:44:21.071 --> 00:44:21.740
this is your,

758
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.610
your you want to come to this conclusion and that's how you found it.

759
00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:29.410
But every now and then he'll sell more than every now and then a lot he'll say

760
00:44:29.411 --> 00:44:32.010
shit that I know is right.
I mean just facts.
Yeah.
But

761
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.390
<v 1>the problem is is a lot of these people are using how they present these facts,</v>

762
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.470
quote unquote is almost like a used car salesman trying to sell you,

763
00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.550
you know jelly beans.
It's like,
like,

764
00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:46.380
like this guy last night he was saying things and I was going to use Carswell's

765
00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:50.640
in 1940 yeah,
car salesman is trying to fuck you

766
00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.660
and sell you a car buddy.

767
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.620
Like I was having a problem with the documentary you watched last night because

768
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.460
he was saying a lot of things and I'm like that could,
that that really true.

769
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.600
And like,
I like how he said I was kind of like,
he said that weird,

770
00:45:05.601 --> 00:45:06.990
does that mean that's not true or not?

771
00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:12.150
And then I researched it last night and he actually does known for that guy for

772
00:45:12.151 --> 00:45:14.040
saying things like,
like a news,

773
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:18.180
like a news report had something on about safe oil.

774
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.820
Then he would say even Fox News has reported on it,
you know,

775
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.880
and how he's saying it,

776
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:26.220
it gives you the impression that they were right about what they're reported on.

777
00:45:26.221 --> 00:45:29.790
But they're not,
they just reported on it.
But you,
he says it's so fast,

778
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:33.270
kind of like a used car sales man that you're kind of just subconsciously going,

779
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:36.150
oh no.
The News reported on it.
You know,
he's a very

780
00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.800
<v 7>pelling speaker and what we're talking about is the,
uh,</v>

781
00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:42.970
the Michael Rupert movie and it's called collapse and what it's all about,

782
00:45:42.971 --> 00:45:46.750
it's about peak oil and it's all about how the world is going to fall apart

783
00:45:46.751 --> 00:45:50.500
because they're going to run out of oil and will now have no way to get goods to

784
00:45:50.501 --> 00:45:53.830
people and groceries and shit.
And there'd be no way to get around.

785
00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.230
We can't manufacture anything because everything's made with plastic.

786
00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.100
<v 1>And another thing like,
Eh,
all right.</v>

787
00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:00.680
So I was thinking this the whole time I'm watching the documentary.

788
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:04.660
Denny said something I blatantly knew he was lying on and I'm like,
no,

789
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.280
blatantly knew.
He knew he was blatantly lie.

790
00:46:07.281 --> 00:46:11.510
I put that word in front of us that's more important.
So he said,

791
00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:16.010
he said that cell phone companies have been slipping on maintenance of their

792
00:46:16.011 --> 00:46:20.410
towers and all time high and that they're all the,
the cell phone towers,
uh,

793
00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.480
not getting maintenance.
Uh,
and there,
yes.

794
00:46:23.481 --> 00:46:27.170
And that pretty soon we are going to have even worse cell phone coverage.

795
00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:30.550
I know for a fact that right now at and t,
Verizon,

796
00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:34.340
everything are on so on top of their game when it comes to cell phone towers and

797
00:46:34.341 --> 00:46:37.620
maintenance and repairs and building their systems up at third,

798
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:39.620
the highest they've ever been in that.

799
00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:43.580
And I have a app on my iPhone called at and t mark the spot.

800
00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:46.760
Every time I get a dropped call or have problems with my service,

801
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.390
it automatically Geo tags the location that you're at and it sends it to a t and

802
00:46:50.391 --> 00:46:54.830
t so they have it on their file so they know where the towers towers are doing

803
00:46:54.831 --> 00:46:57.800
bat.
I've been doing that ever since the APP came out the other day.

804
00:46:57.801 --> 00:47:01.340
They sent me an email to our text message out of the Blue Goin,
hey,

805
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:02.203
just so you know,

806
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:05.450
we've been getting all your reports and thank you because of your reports,

807
00:47:05.451 --> 00:47:08.300
we've decided to build a new tower by your house.

808
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:11.420
It will be in effect in the next two months.
Thank you for using,

809
00:47:11.421 --> 00:47:14.660
continuing to use this application.
It really helps us out a lot.

810
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:17.210
And so right there,
I can tell you right now,

811
00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.020
that's something they didn't do five years ago on at and t's network.
You know,

812
00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:23.900
I was having bad servers there five years ago.
I'm screwed.

813
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:27.110
I know for a fact that that statement alone that that he made in that

814
00:47:27.111 --> 00:47:30.100
documentary was bullshit and so that means everything

815
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.520
<v 0>else that he's doing when he's crying and petting his dog.
And acting like a,</v>

816
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:38.230
some kind of faggot.
Like I know I can't,
I can't believe anything that guy says,

817
00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:42.080
well,
it gets even better.
Here's where it gets better.
First of all,

818
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:45.560
you gave you pet your dog.
First of all,
he was a,
he,

819
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:50.560
he lost a sexual harassment suit,
$125,000 and whatever back wages.

820
00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:55.060
So while it'd be like $127,000 from some woman who was a working for him,

821
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:59.740
uh,
he,
uh,
made a sexual advance and showed up at the door in his underwear.

822
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:03.820
That's awesome.
That was like his move.
And she freaked out and she's like,

823
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:08.530
I don't want any part of this.
So she,
uh,
she got rid of him,
uh,
or she,
uh,

824
00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.960
told them she's not going to fuck him.
And he fired her.

825
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.080
And so she sued and she won.
She won $125,000.
So this guy's,
you know,

826
00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.900
fuck financially because of that.
But the type of person that does that,

827
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:23.830
that first of all tries to fuck their employees at like 50 something years old.

828
00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.101
All right.

829
00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:28.390
This ain't a 20 year old kid and just like taking a while chance somebody gives

830
00:48:28.391 --> 00:48:31.650
him some shitty advice.
Like maybe she just whip your dick out.
Really?
Sure.

831
00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:35.110
Like I know how to give people that advice before and you fucking hear from

832
00:48:35.111 --> 00:48:39.490
their friends,
you know,
the next day,
dude,
the fuck told me to pull my dick out.

833
00:48:39.491 --> 00:48:42.370
She fucking screamed and called the cops.
I'm like,
Whoa,

834
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:43.900
you gotta know when to pull your dick out.

835
00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.120
You can't just pull it out with everybody.
Crazy.
Fuck.

836
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.940
That was the move that my roommates in college,
I always did.

837
00:48:48.941 --> 00:48:50.800
I never had the guts to do it,
but he said,

838
00:48:50.801 --> 00:48:53.510
if the girl won't hook up with you like you're making out,
you're on the things,

839
00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.500
pull it out and start beating off and that she's eating into your two things.

840
00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.670
She's either going to one going to help you or to be so offended and leave,

841
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:04.750
but you kind of swing in for that other 50% is taking a chance.

842
00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:06.970
You gotta know who you're taking the chance with though,
right.

843
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.050
And you don't do it with a chick is fucking working for you like this crazy ass

844
00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:10.550
hole.

845
00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:15.190
Another thing about the movie that drove me nuts was him talking about how he

846
00:49:15.191 --> 00:49:18.190
just likes to go on long walks with his dogs.
Like,
dude,

847
00:49:18.191 --> 00:49:20.260
you just talked about the end of fucking civilization.

848
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:22.670
People are going to starve to death for an hour and a half.
Why?

849
00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.820
Because you're telling cigarettes.
Yeah.
While you're smoking cigarettes,

850
00:49:24.821 --> 00:49:29.440
like a retard.
That's another thing I was going to get into that too.
Look,

851
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.420
you might be intelligent and smoked cigarettes,

852
00:49:31.421 --> 00:49:33.940
but that is a fucking stupid thing to do.

853
00:49:33.941 --> 00:49:38.020
Smoking cigarettes is something that everyone with a brain should figure it out.

854
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.863
Yeah,
we should get,

855
00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:42.790
so when you're talking about the end of the road talking about the end of

856
00:49:42.791 --> 00:49:45.160
civilization,
people are going to suffer me ma,
but dude,

857
00:49:45.161 --> 00:49:47.530
you're going to rot out from the inside real soon.

858
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:51.750
You're in your 50s and your fucking chain smoking while you talk right in here.

859
00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.750
You're giving this doom and gloom lecture and he's got his dog comes over to him

860
00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.600
and he's like,
I just like to go on walks with my dog.
I'm like,

861
00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:01.300
this mother fucker's like a character in a movie.

862
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.140
He's like a character in a Jack London book.
You know?

863
00:50:04.141 --> 00:50:07.510
It's like the man who knows about it and all he does,
he goes on walks,

864
00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:09.790
she stopped blogging about it anymore is not writing.

865
00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:14.380
He's just preparing for the collapse.
Like so I saw that and I'm like,

866
00:50:14.381 --> 00:50:18.370
this guy is all doom and gloom and it has a vested interest.

867
00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.320
The other thing that I didn't like is how,

868
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:25.180
how much pride he took in being right about past things that fucked up.
Oh,

869
00:50:25.181 --> 00:50:27.980
we were so right.
We so nailed down this douche

870
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.770
<v 7>bag.
A lot of people saw the fucking housing bubble asshole.</v>

871
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.320
A lot of people saw that there was going to be an economic collapse.

872
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:36.700
You're not the only person that predicted the fucking stock market was gonna

873
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:40.640
crash because of an overinflated housing market because of all the fucking,

874
00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:44.450
the interest that's out there right now that people can't pay off and crazy

875
00:50:44.451 --> 00:50:47.690
fucking credit card debt and all sorts of bullshit that's going on in Wall

876
00:50:47.691 --> 00:50:48.524
Street and

877
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.860
<v 1>Paul knew that was happening.
Imagine the shit that cut from that interview,</v>

878
00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.090
you know he was,

879
00:50:54.091 --> 00:50:56.790
there was probably one time we started taking off his clothes and asking for

880
00:50:56.791 --> 00:50:58.770
massages from the camera guy and stuff.

881
00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:03.040
There was probably all like a ton of shit that he was saying that when you think

882
00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.480
you're just getting out of line,
this thing,
that guy was,

883
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:10.170
I could just could not believe a word that dude was saying about it or something

884
00:51:10.171 --> 00:51:11.840
about it.
And then so I go on,

885
00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:15.160
<v 7>I go,
okay,
now I have to find out is peak oil real thing,</v>

886
00:51:15.161 --> 00:51:17.800
is there some debate of whether peak oil is a real thing?

887
00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:22.220
So I go online and I see this geologist has a boy on the way

888
00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:25.810
<v 1>for what people don't know.
A peak oil is the point of oil.
Where's the top,</v>

889
00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:28.900
like the highest amount of oil will ever have in this,

890
00:51:28.901 --> 00:51:31.750
in this country or in the world.
So once we're at the ducks,

891
00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.530
<v 7>it reaches a peak and then a decline.</v>

892
00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.670
So there will be less and less oil and it'll get to a point of eventually we

893
00:51:36.671 --> 00:51:40.720
will run out of oil until we can make oil.
Yes.

894
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:43.900
Well what this guy was saying in the Ted talk,
and Ted,
if you don't know,

895
00:51:43.901 --> 00:51:46.980
I don't remember what the acronym Ted stands for,
but the,

896
00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:52.120
the TD talks online are all these like super intelligent genius fucking I get

897
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.290
lost on there.
And they taught us talking about different,
different subjects.

898
00:51:56.291 --> 00:51:57.320
And one of them last night,

899
00:51:57.321 --> 00:52:01.960
it was a guy who's talking about oil and the fucking trillions and trillions of

900
00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.970
barrels of oil that we have discovered over the world.

901
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:07.600
And that geologists know exactly where it is and that we just have to,
you know,

902
00:52:07.601 --> 00:52:09.420
figure out ways to get it from all these different places.

903
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:12.880
So I'm listening to this guy and he's like,
we're not going to run out of oil.

904
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:16.780
What we're going to do is eventually we're going to come up with something that

905
00:52:16.781 --> 00:52:19.900
can replace oil and the his,
his arguments kind of weird too.

906
00:52:19.901 --> 00:52:23.360
He said the Stone Age did not end because we ran out of stones.
Yeah,

907
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:26.230
I thought that was kind of okay.
Yeah,
I see what you're saying,

908
00:52:26.231 --> 00:52:30.100
but that's fucking dumb.
Of course.
With stones don't power anything stupid,

909
00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.110
you know,
like,
you know,
you know what I'm saying?

910
00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:36.370
Like stones using to make things.
Okay.
Yeah,
I see your point.
But look,

911
00:52:36.371 --> 00:52:41.371
this is a lot more complicated scenario going on with the are we require oil for

912
00:52:41.681 --> 00:52:45.790
everything.
For fucking food.
We require oil for vitamins.

913
00:52:45.791 --> 00:52:47.020
We require oil for

914
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:50.540
<v 1>medicine to a point.
But you also,
you're getting a lot of that from that,</v>

915
00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:55.570
that drama queen.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'm getting that from ground.
You don't need oil.

916
00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.760
<v 7>Oh,
Brian.
Yeah.
You do?
What?
What the fuck is going to power the tractors?</v>

917
00:52:58.761 --> 00:52:59.594
What the fuck?

918
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.810
<v 1>Oh my,
my back yard planting.</v>

919
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:06.290
<v 7>Okay.
And then you're going to go somewhere.
I'm going to get on a fucking donkey.</v>

920
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:09.230
I travel somewhere.
You have to take into account shipping.

921
00:53:09.231 --> 00:53:11.060
You haven't taken into account travel.

922
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:14.000
You have to take into account where does everything you buy come from and what

923
00:53:14.001 --> 00:53:17.420
does everything you're buying made out of and the seeds you're going to buy most

924
00:53:17.421 --> 00:53:20.180
likely are going to be in some fucking packaging.
Even if it's paper,

925
00:53:20.181 --> 00:53:22.340
it's going to have paint on the package that paints going to be made at all.

926
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:26.320
<v 1>All right to a point.
But what if you have take point dude?
Well No,
no.</v>

927
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:30.780
The point is oil's gone today.
Alright.
No oil left.
Alright.

928
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.780
I also could just go to my mom.
Hey Mom,
do you have a seed?
Yeah,

929
00:53:33.781 --> 00:53:36.360
I have a whole box of seeds over there.
Can I have them?
Okay,

930
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.240
let me take these seats in my backyard and plant

931
00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:40.330
<v 5>and hey man,
what's he going to get to your mom's house in Ohio,</v>

932
00:53:40.331 --> 00:53:42.820
if you know what I mean?
I'm just saying if she lived next to them,
you say,

933
00:53:42.821 --> 00:53:47.070
well what if she does to me?
You got no oil Sun.
You get what I see.

934
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:51.400
Ridiculous.
Jump on a bicycle on a bicycle.

935
00:53:51.401 --> 00:53:55.690
And getting my mom's tires five months.

936
00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.190
What makes the tires on?
It doesn't matter.

937
00:53:57.191 --> 00:54:00.610
I got my tires are not blown out and my story,

938
00:54:00.611 --> 00:54:02.350
there's no more cars left and then blowing out.

939
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:05.710
I'll use my feet and I'll walk there.
It's going to take two years,

940
00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:08.890
but I'll get some fucking sort of star because it's going to be no food.

941
00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:12.550
Going to travel to get that food to you with with trucks.

942
00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:16.330
Look Dude know oil ethanol well there.
That's the problem.

943
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:20.090
It's his argument about ethanol so it takes more energy to create and all the

944
00:54:20.091 --> 00:54:21.490
shit of one report

945
00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:25.300
<v 1>out of 5,000 reports.
Well you didn't research that as I did.</v>

946
00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.340
I went on last night to Wikipedia because I researched it

947
00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:29.110
<v 5>fucking [inaudible].
It's completely,</v>

948
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.210
I was up til 5:00 AM last night researching this dumb ass from this stupid
movie.

949
00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:38.110
Michael Michael.
Rupert is a dumb ass.
You got official evicted by him

950
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:39.560
<v 1>in his own apartment.</v>

951
00:54:39.590 --> 00:54:42.800
I know retards out and not getting evicted from their own apartment and this guy

952
00:54:42.801 --> 00:54:44.390
I'm supposed to believe and he's getting evicted.

953
00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:47.780
They said during the filming of this movie,
He was getting evicted.
Oh,
really?

954
00:54:47.781 --> 00:54:49.550
You're getting evicted?
Wow.

955
00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:54.320
My sister can't even get evicted and she makes like five bucks a day,
you know?

956
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:58.630
Yeah.
But he's not making any money.
He's trying to warn the world.
He's out there.

957
00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:02.990
He falling.
He describes to the second DVD he's making.
Doesn't have a website,

958
00:55:02.991 --> 00:55:06.620
isn't he?
Going nationwide and giving speeches at holiday inns.

959
00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:09.440
All the hands.
Wait,
come on.
I mean,

960
00:55:09.441 --> 00:55:11.600
it doesn't have like big conferences that he does speak.

961
00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:13.790
He's doing them now because of the movie.

962
00:55:13.791 --> 00:55:16.700
The movie is getting a lot of attention before that.
He did that too.
Yeah,

963
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.350
but nobody was paying attention to him back then.

964
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:19.850
I think Brian has an oil company.

965
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:22.770
<v 5>Brian,
if somebody does not like him,</v>

966
00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:27.900
well I didn't have my check for sure.
For sure.

967
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:32.200
How to our country,
man.
What?
What did you say?
Just kidding.

968
00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.070
What did you say there?

969
00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:37.420
<v 1>Ratted it out our country.
He's the one that ride it out.</v>

970
00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:40.220
What CIA for doing in?
In drugs.
Yeah,

971
00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:44.790
<v 7>so an LAPD officer,
he busted the seat.
Michael Rupert,</v>

972
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:48.390
and he busted the CIA delivering drugs to the the poor neighborhoods,

973
00:55:48.391 --> 00:55:49.770
which is fucking absolutely true.

974
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.160
Which is another thing like we were talking about like the Alex Jones thing,

975
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:56.700
like the Alex Jones thing where there's a guy who was right about some shit,

976
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:58.650
you know,
and he's right about that.

977
00:55:58.651 --> 00:56:01.500
And he was writing about the CIA delivering drugs until these bad neighborhoods

978
00:56:01.501 --> 00:56:04.740
is selling drugs.
I mean that was like a room or back then,

979
00:56:04.741 --> 00:56:06.900
but that shit has been proven now.
I mean there's,

980
00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:09.690
there's so many different cases where so many different,

981
00:56:09.691 --> 00:56:12.630
like Barry seal's in Mena,
Arkansas,
that's not a good one.

982
00:56:12.631 --> 00:56:15.600
There's people who are pilots that have come clean about it.

983
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:19.350
There's the CIA drug plane to crash in Mexico last year with four tons of

984
00:56:19.351 --> 00:56:22.920
cocaine in it.
I mean it's,
it's,
it's a lot of fucking money,
man.

985
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:25.840
It's a lot of money.
And if they're willing to go places and kill people,

986
00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:28.810
you don't think they're willing to sell drugs.
That's ridiculous.

987
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:31.630
The people that are in charge of the government and the people at the highest

988
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:36.160
levels of government have access to all sorts of shit that we don't.

989
00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:40.390
And the fact that there's billions and billions of dollars to be made in drugs

990
00:56:40.391 --> 00:56:44.180
and that drugs,
those drugs are going to get sold anyway.
You know why?

991
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:47.890
Why wouldn't they sell them?
So he's right about that.

992
00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:51.010
He's definitely right about that.
But this peak oil thing,
man,

993
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:55.780
he's all doom and gloom and the end of the world and no one knows there's

994
00:56:55.781 --> 00:56:59.920
nothing that's going to possibly replace it.
Can you fucking say that?

995
00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:01.590
<v 2>Can you say that?
Yeah.</v>

996
00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:06.180
Well that guy in that Ted conference was talking about that.
We used to use wood,

997
00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:09.510
but then we got used fon technology.
What have you read it?
You saw the table.

998
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:13.620
So that would now they used to be a way for us to have energy.
Now that's gone.

999
00:57:13.621 --> 00:57:17.860
And now we moved to this and then we learned from that and then we move on to

1000
00:57:17.861 --> 00:57:18.694
the next thing.

1001
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:22.890
So you were saying that what natural gas and some other type of stuff that

1002
00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:27.300
<v 7>there's the problem is,
man,
we make so much shit with oil.</v>

1003
00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:30.630
It's fucking insane.
Everything in this room is made with oil.

1004
00:57:30.631 --> 00:57:32.250
Your God damn computers made with oil.

1005
00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:34.280
<v 2>Yeah,
but like everything is made with oil.</v>

1006
00:57:34.281 --> 00:57:37.370
Isn't there a way to make it not with oil for the most part?
I don't know.

1007
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:40.460
I think they're right.
There has to be.
There has to be like,
well,
yes,

1008
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:44.000
making with oil is the best way,
but you can also make it with,
with corn.

1009
00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:44.801
<v 7>Well maybe,</v>

1010
00:57:44.801 --> 00:57:48.040
but I mean think about all the oil that's coming out in the Gulf right now.

1011
00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:51.220
75,000 barrels a day.
I don't know how many gallons is that?

1012
00:57:51.221 --> 00:57:55.510
How many gallons is 75,000 barrels?
It's fucking insane.

1013
00:57:55.511 --> 00:57:59.650
Insane amounts.
Whatever the fuck it is.
Hundred thousand who the fuck knows?

1014
00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:04.090
So 75 to a hundred thousand gallons a day or barrels a day.

1015
00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:06.430
Is is leaking out into the,

1016
00:58:06.431 --> 00:58:09.460
into the golf p person that you can make plastic with him?
Yeah,
you can.

1017
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:14.520
I posted a thing today on my Twitter about a hemp car from 1941 with a from

1018
00:58:14.921 --> 00:58:18.160
Henry Ford,
but I don't know if you can make all the shame,

1019
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:19.720
the same shit that you can make with oil.

1020
00:58:19.721 --> 00:58:23.140
My point is that the amount of oil that's coming out just in that one area and

1021
00:58:23.141 --> 00:58:24.670
the golf is insane.

1022
00:58:24.671 --> 00:58:28.570
Think about how long it would take you to grow that much hemp to make oil out of

1023
00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:31.390
it.
Yeah,
I mean fucking incredible.
I mean,

1024
00:58:31.391 --> 00:58:34.660
you would have to have a farm the size of the Moon,
you know?

1025
00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:38.170
You know what I mean?
I mean,
this shit is just pouring out into the ocean.

1026
00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:42.750
There's not that enough.
We need to do that in the whole world.
Not your,

1027
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:43.681
how are you going to grow it?

1028
00:58:43.681 --> 00:58:47.800
You're going to have to have skyscrapers like sizes of like a hundred football

1029
00:58:47.801 --> 00:58:51.850
fields,
a hundred stories high,
and each,
each floor is hydroponics.

1030
00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:57.210
<v 2>Each node in Detroit there they're thinking about doing that or urban farming.</v>

1031
00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:01.560
You know,
there's so many areas of Detroit that there's no homes anymore dirt.

1032
00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:03.910
<v 7>I'm talking about hydroponic buildings.
Yeah,</v>

1033
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:07.530
I'm talking about gigantic fucking buildings and even that would not be enough.

1034
00:59:07.531 --> 00:59:10.010
We'd only guys,
they mean,

1035
00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:12.560
think about the oil is coming out of the ground right now.
That's,

1036
00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:13.890
that's an incredible amount of oil.

1037
00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:18.180
When you go and you drive down to PCH to those offshore oil rigs and you think

1038
00:59:18.181 --> 00:59:19.830
about how many of them must be out there in the world,

1039
00:59:19.831 --> 00:59:23.510
how many different rigs when take that a drive from a [inaudible] get to the

1040
00:59:23.511 --> 00:59:25.760
airport,
you know that drive,
you see those oil rigs,

1041
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:28.130
you don't think about those until some shit happens.

1042
00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:31.310
<v 1>Well,
how many of those are out there?
How many of them are in Texas?</v>

1043
00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:37.020
Oil Man do anything they don't seem like to do anything says the scientist and

1044
00:59:37.021 --> 00:59:41.060
it's like one little raggedy one that looks like an old farmer may put up there

1045
00:59:41.061 --> 00:59:41.840
in a long time ago.

1046
00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.150
That statement is how Michael [inaudible] has got to discredit you for

1047
00:59:44.151 --> 00:59:44.984
discrediting him.

1048
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:50.210
This full doesn't even know that those things pump out thousands of barrels of

1049
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:52.460
gallons of oil a day.
He said,
Joe,

1050
00:59:52.461 --> 00:59:56.680
I got an email from somebody from China that wanted us to talk about the Foxconn

1051
00:59:56.690 --> 01:00:01.190
suicides in an,
if you knew anything about that.
The Fox con suicides,

1052
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.810
there's a huge company in China that makes a called Fox con and they make

1053
01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:09.690
everything like keyboard mice.
They make a lot like iPods,
iPhones.

1054
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:13.190
They're the ones that put together all the computers and they're just super

1055
01:00:13.191 --> 01:00:15.500
cheap help.
And Foxconn,
I think,

1056
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.680
I want to say it's 500,000 employees work at it and they all live there and they

1057
01:00:20.841 --> 01:00:24.590
just worked nonstop.
I mean they're talking,
they wake up,

1058
01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:28.760
work and go to bed and I think they only get like eight hours sleep and they'd

1059
01:00:28.761 --> 01:00:33.590
go right back to work.
And,
and anyways,
in the last uh,
year,
I want to say,

1060
01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:37.370
or with this year alone,
there's already been 11 suicides,

1061
01:00:37.371 --> 01:00:41.780
I think it was and 30 attempted suicides.
Holy Shit.

1062
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:45.330
I guess how many employees of,
uh,
I don't know how many,
but I,

1063
01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:48.670
it's a lot of employees.
I want to say 500,000 kill themselves at work.

1064
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.070
I'm not sure.
There's been people,
I want to have a pizza party or something,

1065
01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.280
you know,
on a Friday you have that many people,
Hey,

1066
01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:58.760
your company tried to kill themselves.
Maybe,
maybe Fridays,
casual fun day,

1067
01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:00.420
shirt day

1068
01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:04.280
<v 7>about when it comes to like cheap products and cheap electronics.
I mean there's,</v>

1069
01:01:04.281 --> 01:01:08.870
there's really only one way to get a fucking net book for 700 bucks.
Right?
Okay.

1070
01:01:08.871 --> 01:01:12.920
And that way is some dude has to eat rice out of a little bowl and sleep in a

1071
01:01:12.921 --> 01:01:16.430
box and he has to wake up to a whip and,
and,

1072
01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.770
and fucking do it all over again every day of the week.

1073
01:01:18.771 --> 01:01:21.710
And he doesn't get any days off.
I mean,
that's the only way to make that shit.

1074
01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:26.330
You can't make that shit with union American guys from Detroit.
You know,

1075
01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:28.460
it's going to take too much time.
It's going to cost too much money.

1076
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:31.790
One of the reasons why you can get a net book for 600 bucks or however,

1077
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:33.370
I think they're like 500 bucks,
right?

1078
01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.260
<v 1>Yeah.
You can get him for two 99 up.
Yeah.
That's incredible.</v>

1079
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:40.830
So you can get a little fucking computer for 200 900 bucks.
I mean,

1080
01:01:40.831 --> 01:01:43.710
when you get on youtube,
you're like,
oh,
that's why it's two 99

1081
01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.360
<v 7>yeah,
but so what dude?
Think about what you could get just a few hundred feet,</v>

1082
01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:50.380
you know,
for a few hundred dollars a couple of years ago.
Yeah.

1083
01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.620
I mean that's a pretty incredible piece of technology for 300 bucks.

1084
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:55.960
<v 3>I can't believe how much stuff you can't buy here.</v>

1085
01:01:55.961 --> 01:01:58.720
I was trying to find this company that makes scissors,

1086
01:01:58.721 --> 01:02:02.280
you know those orange handled junk drawer scissors that everybody has.
Right.

1087
01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:06.870
I was trying to find a US based company to make these scissors right then.

1088
01:02:06.871 --> 01:02:08.710
Couldn't do it.
I,
I've probably,
I've,

1089
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:12.310
I've given up look googling it and trying to find scissors,

1090
01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:15.610
manufacturers and all this stuff.
It's like just huge.

1091
01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:16.660
It's just a pair of scissors.

1092
01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:20.190
<v 1>Yeah.
You go to Michael's,
you got to go to arts and crafts.</v>

1093
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:21.450
Those are actually team

1094
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:27.900
<v 7>amazon.com by them.
I want to find a place that will produce them for</v>

1095
01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:32.820
different,
not just purchase this rent to the wrong store.
Dude,

1096
01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.850
I know he was talking about people are fucking dying.

1097
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:38.880
<v 1>He's saying he wants to find a manufacturer.</v>

1098
01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.760
<v 7>No,
but I'm saying I can't even find that here.
That everyone I found is overseas.</v>

1099
01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:47.810
So that's why it again,
no one has time here to be making scissors.

1100
01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.810
We're fucking,
how are we going to cut?

1101
01:02:50.811 --> 01:02:54.560
The trees are going to war and plugging up that hole and the Gulf that's pumping

1102
01:02:54.561 --> 01:02:58.430
out oil.
We ain't got no time.
Little fatty scissors with the rounded tips.

1103
01:02:58.431 --> 01:02:59.264
He little pussy

1104
01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:01.620
<v 1>crazy about this Fox con thing in the morning.
That's insane.</v>

1105
01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:03.230
The more I looked into it,
right.
So for one thing,

1106
01:03:03.231 --> 01:03:08.120
they only get 900 Chinese yen per month,
which is about $130.
Our uh,

1107
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:09.310
our thing,
and this is working,

1108
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:13.430
<v 7>they get $130 a month.
Yeah.</v>

1109
01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:17.020
And Shit I didn't know about how did I not,
how was I

1110
01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.820
<v 1>whereabout and,
and,
and these guys are,</v>

1111
01:03:19.821 --> 01:03:22.520
these guys are employed a apple employees.

1112
01:03:22.521 --> 01:03:25.070
I'm Sony employees and all the big guys.
Actually,

1113
01:03:25.071 --> 01:03:27.450
I don't want to say Sony does because I'm not 100% sure.
Told us.

1114
01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:32.570
I know for sure to apple does and uh,
guards beating employees.

1115
01:03:32.571 --> 01:03:36.950
Like there's all these like stories about this place where they have live video

1116
01:03:36.951 --> 01:03:37.784
of like the,

1117
01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:42.050
the guards at this place beating up the employees on tape to China's a mother

1118
01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:43.670
Fucker,
dude.
Yeah.

1119
01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:46.830
<v 7>China is a motherfucker.
There's a billion people there.</v>

1120
01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:50.910
And the bottom line about human beings is once you get into really large numbers

1121
01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:54.960
of us,
we lose our appreciation for each other.
I mean,
it's just,
that's,

1122
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:58.090
that's how it is with rats.
That's how it is with money.
I mean,

1123
01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.510
if you have a lot of money,
fucking,
you drop a dollar,

1124
01:04:00.511 --> 01:04:03.000
you don't give a shit about it,
but you have $5 to drop a dollar.

1125
01:04:03.001 --> 01:04:05.220
That dollar is important to you.
Right.
You know,
and when,

1126
01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:08.670
when there's too many God damn people and you get to a point where there's a

1127
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:09.031
billion people,

1128
01:04:09.031 --> 01:04:12.900
there's not enough food and you're literally regulating how many children people

1129
01:04:12.901 --> 01:04:17.400
can have because it's so overpopulated.
You know,
China has a billion people.

1130
01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:22.490
There was a billion people in the entire fucking world up until like a hundred

1131
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:26.010
years ago.
You know,
do you know how nutty that is?

1132
01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.170
Just a couple hundred years ago,

1133
01:04:28.171 --> 01:04:31.260
there was no more than a billion in the whole fucking world.

1134
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.960
Now they're all in China and who knows what the real number is,
man.

1135
01:04:34.961 --> 01:04:38.010
And we don't really know what the real number in America is.
We don't,

1136
01:04:38.011 --> 01:04:42.030
I mean it's,
it's how difficult is it to take a census of a billion people

1137
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:47.010
<v 1>by the way,
that the census guy hid in a,
is his car and stocked my house.</v>

1138
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:49.980
What?
Yeah.
All right.
A couple weeks ago we were talking about the census.

1139
01:04:49.981 --> 01:04:53.730
Remember this,
I asked you to do I have to do this and right.
Anyways,

1140
01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:57.090
so I came home the other night and there was this guy outside of my house

1141
01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.840
looking sketchy as fuck.
And then I just kind of like get in the house,

1142
01:05:00.841 --> 01:05:03.450
getting the house,
getting the house right.
And then later that night,

1143
01:05:03.451 --> 01:05:04.590
maybe four hours later,

1144
01:05:04.591 --> 01:05:07.410
I see him sitting in my car and his car outside of my house.
I'm like,

1145
01:05:07.411 --> 01:05:10.290
there's that same guy.
And so I'm like,
ah,
okay.

1146
01:05:10.291 --> 01:05:12.770
I'm just walking to my car and suddenly he gets out of his car,

1147
01:05:12.771 --> 01:05:15.630
it looks at me and it gets back in his car cause I got in my car,

1148
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:19.990
then I came back home.
He was still there.
I go in my house,
he rings my doorbell.

1149
01:05:19.991 --> 01:05:21.190
He was from the census.

1150
01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.010
<v 7>And did you ask him,
hey,</v>

1151
01:05:23.011 --> 01:05:25.080
why the fuck were you sitting in front of my house all day?

1152
01:05:25.310 --> 01:05:28.600
<v 1>Did I just,
I answered his questions and he showed me as,</v>

1153
01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:32.550
what's a good time if I asked me,

1154
01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:36.900
showed me a census badge and I was asking all these crazy questions about people

1155
01:05:36.901 --> 01:05:39.480
that lived here April 1st I've been who lived here April 1st I'm like,

1156
01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:42.510
actually no one.
And then they're like,
are you okay?
And then,

1157
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:47.630
but he kind of made me feel like I was in trouble and I wasn't how we're doing.

1158
01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:52.170
They have a right to the law.
It's the law.
The law is,

1159
01:05:52.171 --> 01:05:55.050
they have a right to interview and asked her all these questions at their

1160
01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:57.660
convenience.
I don't know,
but he was outside of my house

1161
01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:02.380
<v 7>appointment.
Shouldn't be able to ring your doorbell.
I got shit to do,
Dude.</v>

1162
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.890
If you want to give you an email address,
I'll call you pretty freaky.
Oh,

1163
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:06.310
give me your email address and I'll call you.

1164
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:08.710
<v 1>I think they're like head hunters now.
They had,</v>

1165
01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.260
I think in California the response was so bad for the that they actually hired

1166
01:06:13.261 --> 01:06:14.094
like headhunters,

1167
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:19.190
like private eye guys to get that filled mine out and then I got one a month

1168
01:06:19.201 --> 01:06:24.000
later saying,
sorry you're part of the section of is that we lost,

1169
01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:24.893
can you redo it?

1170
01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:30.300
So they lost like I filled out one twice or some guy trying to steal my identity

1171
01:06:30.301 --> 01:06:32.390
and just thought he'd give anything government

1172
01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:34.010
<v 7>man,
anything with the government.</v>

1173
01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.190
The problem with it is you've got a bunch of people for the most part that are

1174
01:06:37.191 --> 01:06:39.170
working for the government that don't want to be there.

1175
01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.170
That's the fucking problem with any of those jobs.

1176
01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.260
<v 1>This is even worse cause I a valet.</v>

1177
01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:49.140
The other day I went to the saddle ranch on sunset and I've outlaid and I just

1178
01:06:49.141 --> 01:06:52.980
got in the mail at a parking ticket when they vowed took my car,

1179
01:06:52.981 --> 01:06:56.190
they parked it in a red zone,
got a ticket,
took the ticket off the car,

1180
01:06:56.310 --> 01:07:00.930
I got a ticket,
I would never have known about it and I owe like $130 now.

1181
01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:04.170
Wow,
you should go there.
Well I told to saddle ranch and they were like,

1182
01:07:04.171 --> 01:07:06.810
we don't own that validates and I called the valet guy and they're like,

1183
01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.490
we don't do that.
And I'm like,
ah.

1184
01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:12.870
So I fouled out this whole thing with the state like a,
like a,
hey,

1185
01:07:12.871 --> 01:07:14.310
I didn't do this report.

1186
01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.940
<v 7>Annoying or you're still responsible.</v>

1187
01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.890
One of the most annoying and irritating things about La is that you've got a

1188
01:07:19.891 --> 01:07:22.820
valet everywhere.
I don't like that shit at all.

1189
01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:26.240
Have some dude just farting in your car and wife went through your drawers.

1190
01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:27.550
You ever had anything come up?
Missing?

1191
01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.170
<v 1>All the time.
All the time.
All the time.</v>

1192
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:33.890
<v 7>Yeah.
I don't.
I W if I can avoid a valet,
I never keep shit in my car anymore.</v>

1193
01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.740
I don't have a goddamn thing and there I have gum because you want to steal my

1194
01:07:36.741 --> 01:07:37.574
gum goes.

1195
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:39.850
<v 1>They always take quarters.
They will stay that of course,</v>

1196
01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:42.230
like if I have a quarters,
dimes and nickels,
I'll go back in and,

1197
01:07:42.231 --> 01:07:46.250
and the quarters are all gone.
Do you ask them now?
I stopped even bothering.
Wow.

1198
01:07:46.251 --> 01:07:49.310
You just taking the hand where the car cams don't they have where we can just

1199
01:07:49.311 --> 01:07:52.160
set it and we'll take it to some valets and then we'll shoot them for stealing

1200
01:07:52.161 --> 01:07:56.820
her stuff inside edition.
Then Chris,

1201
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:59.560
Matthew,
whatever his name is,
can pop up out of the back accident.

1202
01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:01.280
Ask you why you have those quarters in your hand.

1203
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:04.460
I'm just going to help a kid acts that they did it.

1204
01:08:04.461 --> 01:08:08.690
There's a really cool video of you.
Google,
NBC,
Los Angeles,
uh,

1205
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:12.200
Valet car,
something like that.
Do something like that.

1206
01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.750
There's a really cool report they did.
They busted people how dude?

1207
01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:15.980
It was like out of 10 of

1208
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.310
<v 2>them,
they took things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It happens all the time.</v>

1209
01:08:19.311 --> 01:08:21.020
Show on like I'd watch that show.

1210
01:08:21.021 --> 01:08:24.590
I watched some bait car show the other day where they have this car that the set

1211
01:08:24.591 --> 01:08:27.800
up to let people steal and then once the steel it,
they're driving,

1212
01:08:27.801 --> 01:08:31.370
it's all Camden and then the guy can shut down the car as you drive in and

1213
01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:34.940
locked the guys in.
I've seen that.
Yeah.
So,
but do that with valets.

1214
01:08:34.941 --> 01:08:37.100
That'd be awesome.
How about just capital

1215
01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.890
<v 7>fucking parking lot?
You know,
most of the places where you go to,</v>

1216
01:08:39.891 --> 01:08:42.440
you don't have fucking valet parking everywhere.

1217
01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:47.420
It's just la is like lacking in space,
but everyone drives,

1218
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:49.460
it's not like New York where they're lacking space,

1219
01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:52.370
but you take a cab or the subway or whatever,
you know.

1220
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:55.580
No one drives New York are very few people do you know most of the people to get

1221
01:08:55.581 --> 01:08:58.340
around other ways.
But in la everybody fucking drives.

1222
01:08:58.341 --> 01:09:00.140
But there's still the same space problem.

1223
01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:03.380
You can't have like an expensive restaurant and a giant parking structure there.

1224
01:09:03.381 --> 01:09:07.460
It's too much money.
You know,
I avoid places.
If I can't park my car,

1225
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:11.000
I just don't go there.
I don't,
you know,
it's very rare.

1226
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:14.540
It has to be like a meeting that I have to go to or have to valet and then I'm

1227
01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:15.770
like,
mother Fucker,

1228
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:20.390
I'll park blocks away and walk just so someone doesn't have to sit in my fucking

1229
01:09:20.391 --> 01:09:24.560
car.
Touch my shit.
I went in my car once and there was Mexican music playing.

1230
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:28.880
I'm like,
you mother Fucker,
you found a Mexican station.

1231
01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.730
You know he went right to,
I mean I had it on satellite radio.

1232
01:09:31.731 --> 01:09:34.520
He switched it to am,
went right to his Mexican station.

1233
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:37.940
How long is he driving for it?
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
What the fuck.
Exactly.

1234
01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:42.500
That's a terrible part about living in la.
I remember there was a comedy club.

1235
01:09:42.501 --> 01:09:45.710
I used to work out where you'd have to valet and every time I'd come back I

1236
01:09:45.711 --> 01:09:50.150
noticed my gas was completely gone and it was in Michigan to what the guy would

1237
01:09:50.151 --> 01:09:52.760
do.
He'd go,
well,
he's just the MC.

1238
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:57.530
They would sit in my car throughout the whole show and keep warm the heat on,

1239
01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.690
burn up all the gas.

1240
01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.410
<v 2>And then when at the show was over and then they give me my car back.
Wow.</v>

1241
01:10:03.411 --> 01:10:06.020
Did you say something to him?
I said something to the owner or whatever.
Then the,

1242
01:10:06.021 --> 01:10:09.130
I remember the guy who owned the place gave me 10 bucks and he goes,

1243
01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:13.070
quit your wine and gave me wine.
And it was probably about 19 years old,

1244
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:18.800
which are wine and give it,
kept your car running.
I've been farting in your car,

1245
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:23.750
sitting here doing whatever,
smoking cigarettes.
Oh yeah,
probably.

1246
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:26.223
Sure.

1247
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:30.870
<v 7>And the other problem is if you have a nice car and you drop your shit off at</v>

1248
01:10:30.871 --> 01:10:34.230
the valet,
look,
they,
you know,
the people that are working in valets,

1249
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:38.010
they don't have nice shit.
You know,
and you have this,
I mean they're,

1250
01:10:38.011 --> 01:10:39.120
they're working,
they're poor.

1251
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:43.560
They're either college kids they're trying to get by or they're immigrants that

1252
01:10:43.561 --> 01:10:45.360
are probably here illegally,
you know,

1253
01:10:45.361 --> 01:10:47.970
and they don't have enough money to afford a BMW or whatever the fuck you have,

1254
01:10:47.971 --> 01:10:50.280
Mercedes or something like that.
So what and again,
this car,

1255
01:10:50.281 --> 01:10:53.640
they almost feel like it.
Like,
like who the fuck are you to have this?
You know,

1256
01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.500
there's a lot of people that have that attitude.

1257
01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:58.260
A lot of poor people that have that attitude though that why the fuck do you

1258
01:10:58.261 --> 01:11:01.140
deserve this attitude?
Like I,
I remember when I was a kid,

1259
01:11:01.141 --> 01:11:04.850
this guy keyed this car and uh,
and,
and,
and I go,

1260
01:11:04.851 --> 01:11:07.170
why the fuck did you keep that car?
It was like a nice car.
And he goes,

1261
01:11:07.171 --> 01:11:10.550
he gives a fuck guys are rich asshole.
I'm like,
the guys are rich asphalt.

1262
01:11:10.551 --> 01:11:13.980
Cause he has a nice car.
Yeah.
What a,
what

1263
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.970
<v 0>a weird attitude.</v>

1264
01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:19.080
And that's an attitude a lot of people share that mentality of like,
you know,

1265
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:21.900
screw the rich or the rich shocking or blah blah,
blah.
You're like,

1266
01:11:21.901 --> 01:11:25.590
and then I always think,
yes,
screw those guys for making goals.

1267
01:11:25.591 --> 01:11:28.530
Setting outcomes for themselves.
Getting educations.

1268
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:33.260
I had a guy call me a rich asshole once.
Yeah.
But I was trying to fucking,

1269
01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:36.750
but I was trying to fucking suburban,
it wasn't even like a rich car.

1270
01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:41.460
It was just a white suburban and the guy cut me off and uh,

1271
01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:43.590
you know,
and,
and,
and somehow or another,
you know,

1272
01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:47.190
he yelled something out the window and I yell,
some go fuck yourself.
And he goes,

1273
01:11:47.191 --> 01:11:50.310
fuck you.
You fucking rich asshole.
Like that was his,

1274
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.370
that was a part of his insult that I was rich.
Yeah.

1275
01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:56.490
It would have been when somebody ran into your car recently and they were like,

1276
01:11:56.491 --> 01:12:00.540
come on,
you have a lot of money.
I paid for that dude.
They're girls broke.

1277
01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:03.660
But the only reason why I did it was because she was an assistant to someone

1278
01:12:03.661 --> 01:12:07.620
that I know who's a,
an executive.
But the fact that she even said that,
she goes,

1279
01:12:07.621 --> 01:12:09.360
yeah,
you're not even gonna miss it.
I'm like,

1280
01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:14.310
it's just gonna cost like 3000 bucks to fix.
But she didn't have insurance.

1281
01:12:14.311 --> 01:12:16.850
It was a fucking disaster.
And she was drunk.
You know,

1282
01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:20.100
I should've got her arrested,
but I'm like,
you shouldn't be driving drunk.

1283
01:12:20.101 --> 01:12:22.890
You fucking dumped sloughed.
Yeah.
By the way.

1284
01:12:22.891 --> 01:12:25.860
Do I say things like that to people too?
By the way,
when they hit your car,

1285
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:30.100
you can call them dumps.
Sluts.
Kickass was one of the best movies I've ever seen.

1286
01:12:30.101 --> 01:12:34.620
It told you God,
I love that I can.
Phenomenal little girl.
Uh,
I just want to like,

1287
01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:37.410
I love,
I love how in the movie they actually,
even if it said something like it,

1288
01:12:37.411 --> 01:12:41.400
like I like how you went from someone scratches up your car.
Oh yeah.
Did a

1289
01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:45.960
random movie reviews by Brian Red Band.
Just thinking of her.

1290
01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:50.070
I haven't had macaroni and cheese in a while out of nowhere.

1291
01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:54.200
That's what kind of tight ship we run over here.
We stay on subject.
Yeah.

1292
01:12:54.201 --> 01:12:57.240
If you tried to like follow like a mind map of the subjects that we cover on

1293
01:12:57.241 --> 01:13:00.900
this fucking thing.
A stoner's paradise of rambles.

1294
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:04.490
But I had a guy like that,
you know,
say something about being rich or,
or,

1295
01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:08.640
or whatever.
And it's,
I think a lot of people forget like,
well me for a comic,

1296
01:13:08.641 --> 01:13:13.350
I was doing standup for what,
1516 years before I made any real money.

1297
01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.290
I mean dumb and salt.
I did.
It's a dumb installed.

1298
01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:20.040
You're successful at the game of money and that's all that's a dumb and salt you

1299
01:13:20.041 --> 01:13:22.920
fucking successful.
Winner of the game of money.

1300
01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.410
It's the dumbest insult of all time because that's all it is.

1301
01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:27.660
And you might be successful at the game of money because somebody gave you a

1302
01:13:27.661 --> 01:13:28.830
bunch of chips.
You know,

1303
01:13:28.831 --> 01:13:31.800
you might've been born rich or you might've made it yourself.
But either way,

1304
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:33.630
what the fuck kind of insult is that?

1305
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:36.990
And what the fuck is it with people with when they don't have it and other

1306
01:13:36.991 --> 01:13:39.840
people do.
I remember Jimmy Kimmel was talking to this lady once.

1307
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:43.620
He was on Larry King live,
and he was talking to this woman who had a,
um,

1308
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:47.970
some sort of a service where they would give you a map of the stars houses and

1309
01:13:47.971 --> 01:13:51.120
they would,
she would like had an,
oh,
was a stalker website.
That's what it was.

1310
01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:53.580
And she would like,
they would put up updates.
Like,

1311
01:13:53.581 --> 01:13:56.600
this guy is here and this guy's there.
And you go like,
find out where stalker,

1312
01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:59.810
is that what it is?
[inaudible] dot com the Tokyo for any advertising.

1313
01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:03.600
Fuck that cunt.
Anyway,
she,
um,
she was on and he said,

1314
01:14:03.601 --> 01:14:06.870
don't you think that this is kind of dangerous?
Like you're giving stalkers the,

1315
01:14:06.871 --> 01:14:11.620
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the current whereabouts of all these people?
And she goes,
oh,

1316
01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.300
well they'll be able to cry them,

1317
01:14:13.301 --> 01:14:16.810
sleeps and piles and piles cry themselves to sleep and piles of money.

1318
01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.060
Like that was her response to it.

1319
01:14:19.061 --> 01:14:21.610
Like she didn't feel responsible even though she's putting these people in

1320
01:14:21.611 --> 01:14:25.750
harm's danger because they have money and like she thought it was like a valid

1321
01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:26.651
thing to say.

1322
01:14:26.651 --> 01:14:30.190
Like there'll be able to cry themselves to sleep and their piles of money.
Like,

1323
01:14:30.191 --> 01:14:33.640
wow,
what a weird way of looking at the world,
you know?
Yeah,

1324
01:14:33.641 --> 01:14:37.420
I'm going to put you in danger and a,
you know,
a deal with it because yeah,

1325
01:14:37.421 --> 01:14:42.030
you can deal with it.
You've got money.
Whoa.
Really?
And she felt that,

1326
01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:46.030
she felt like that's a valid,
valid explanation.
You know,
she felt like,

1327
01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:49.760
<v 6>you know,
there's a lot of angry people when it comes to celebrities.</v>

1328
01:14:49.761 --> 01:14:53.150
Look at Lindsay Lohan and all this shit.
If that happened to anybody else,

1329
01:14:53.151 --> 01:14:57.350
they'd be in jail.
And He loved Lens.
They show up,
you know,
that whole thing.

1330
01:14:57.351 --> 01:14:59.670
She didn't go to jail.
She has to wear this little bracelet,
you know,

1331
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:01.850
even though she's lying about a passport,

1332
01:15:01.851 --> 01:15:03.270
even though she's lying about all this shit.

1333
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:07.640
So that's why they're mad was she was supposed to go to all these drug and

1334
01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:12.530
alcohol classes and then uh,
she missed her court date.
Who has a fuck?

1335
01:15:12.650 --> 01:15:14.900
Here's,
here's,
here's what my taking the story.
She's a little kid,

1336
01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:16.730
little kid that got famous and rich,

1337
01:15:16.731 --> 01:15:20.300
like little kid that kidnapped two other people that ran from the cops.

1338
01:15:20.301 --> 01:15:24.230
Drunk driving was caught with cocaine was co,
you know like kitchen.
Yeah.

1339
01:15:24.231 --> 01:15:25.850
To people.
How'd you kidnap them?

1340
01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.430
They were in the back seat and wouldn't stop the car and she was out running

1341
01:15:28.431 --> 01:15:31.970
from the cops are the ones that are suing and it's like,
it's like,

1342
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:36.650
like all this like crazy seven charges,
but yet she's not seeing one,
you know,

1343
01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:40.130
going to jail at all.
And that would happen to me.
I'll be fucking in jail still.

1344
01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.320
Okay.
Is that true or is it because of the

1345
01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:45.180
<v 0>prison systems in La are super overcrowded.
You know that,
right?</v>

1346
01:15:45.181 --> 01:15:47.640
You know that they're releasing violent prisoners secretly.

1347
01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.710
Like it's like they're,
they're having like real problems.

1348
01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:54.260
<v 6>California is completely insight,
right?
Yeah.
I'll give you some insight info.</v>

1349
01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:57.920
This girl's not supposed to be doing any drugs or any alcohol right now.

1350
01:15:58.010 --> 01:16:01.550
It's cause she's on probation.
Right?
I know not to rat her out.

1351
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:06.500
I am going to rat her out.
Right.
Allegedly.

1352
01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:11.240
Don't be a rat,
Brian.
All right.
Don't you got to get her locked in a cage.

1353
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:14.900
All right.
Never mind.
I won't tell us anything.
What do you know?

1354
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:19.730
Do you know some shit?
I know a lot of,
she's a little kid,
dude.

1355
01:16:19.731 --> 01:16:22.190
If you were in that situation,
you'd be a hundred times worse.
Okay.

1356
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:26.130
I will not talk about her anymore.
I'm sorry.
You Go.
Good for you.
It didn't.

1357
01:16:26.131 --> 01:16:28.340
She get famous and she was like fucking 16 or something like that.

1358
01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:29.840
A lot younger than that.

1359
01:16:29.841 --> 01:16:33.740
She just being that a wacky Friday or freaky Friday where he played a twin,

1360
01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:36.620
you know herself.
So she doesn't need middle kid.
The Disney girl.

1361
01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:41.420
<v 0>Wow.
That's gotta be crazy man.
Go from a Disney girl to a party slot.</v>

1362
01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:45.050
Internationally known party Slot Jet Setting,

1363
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:50.180

So how does she a piss clean?

Well,

1367

otherwise a couple of ways.

1368
01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:05.470
There's either the shit you drink that's like Gatorade that just dilutes your

1369
01:17:05.471 --> 01:17:08.620
investor.

There was a few of them.

1373
01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:24.350
A test you for pot.
Like you can't even smoke pot on the weekend.

1374
01:17:24.351 --> 01:17:25.880
If you work at gateway,

1375
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:30.440
like Jesus fucking Christ will you let me enjoy my weekend.

1376
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:32.270
I get off Friday.

1377
01:17:32.271 --> 01:17:36.770
I've been slinging shitty fucking computers for pennies all week.

1378
01:17:36.771 --> 01:17:41.771
Giving you most of my waking hours and you won't let me have a fucking joint on

1379
01:17:42.471 --> 01:17:45.080
Saturday.
I can't watch a movie.

1380
01:17:45.081 --> 01:17:48.620
I can't smoke a joint and go see Avatar.
Really?

1381
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:51.220
They you fucking cunt.
That was great.

1382
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:56.010
<v 6>This one place actually sold real urine that you warm up and you put in between</v>

1383
01:17:56.011 --> 01:17:58.080
your crotch.
So when you go to do p thing,

1384
01:17:58.081 --> 01:18:01.440
it stays warm because it's in between your legs and it's actually not your urine

1385
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.450
and they get your urine elect.
Congratulations.

1386
01:18:03.451 --> 01:18:06.510
You passed the test and you're pregnant,
right?
Bum,
bum bum.

1387
01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:09.690
You might want to go see what kind of pistol you're going to get though.

1388
01:18:09.691 --> 01:18:12.420
How do you know it's clean?
Piss?
Uh,
I guess you don't,

1389
01:18:12.690 --> 01:18:16.200
Kevin Randleman got busted with a nonhuman urine.

1390
01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:21.870
Yeah.
It was either synthetic urine or it was your end from a dead person because

1391
01:18:21.871 --> 01:18:25.320
there was no hormones in the urine.
Like they tested his urine and they're like,

1392
01:18:25.330 --> 01:18:26.760
yeah,
yeah,
there's no steroids.

1393
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:31.120
<v 0>There's no anything else either in here fucker.
Because apple juice is this shit.</v>

1394
01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.250
<v 6>It was some synthetic fucking fake urine.
They did.
He got,
you know,</v>

1395
01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:41.680
I dunno.
It's persons.
Do you use the fake p four times?
They said Fake pee?

1396
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:43.240
Yeah.
Yeah,
you can get,
well you know,

1397
01:18:43.241 --> 01:18:45.220
I think it depends on the sophistication of the task,

1398
01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:49.470
but some places they test your fucking hair,
dude,
the old hair sample here,

1399
01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:54.130
they have shampoo for that do then you just put the shampoo on before your thing

1400
01:18:54.131 --> 01:18:55.040
and it uh,

1401
01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:58.260
<v 0>kills all the THC in your hand.
Does something,
well,</v>

1402
01:18:58.261 --> 01:19:01.620
I know Nick Diaz passes those tests like a motherfucker and he smokes a lot of

1403
01:19:01.621 --> 01:19:05.940
weed and he passes.
I mean he's,
he got popped in I think,

1404
01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:11.310
I think you got popped in Vegas when he beat gummy.
Yeah,
that's what it was.

1405
01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:11.970
He turned,

1406
01:19:11.970 --> 01:19:15.030
turned up positive and they said that he had so much wheat and the system,

1407
01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:19.980
it was like he got high and then thought
he might've done that.
He says he didn't,

1408
01:19:19.981 --> 01:19:22.890
but you know,
he smoked so much weed though.

1409
01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.360
It's probably in a system all the time.

1410
01:19:24.361 --> 01:19:27.930
He probably just forgot to take whatever he does to clean himself out.
You know?

1411
01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.720
I don't know what you gotta do.
You gotta drink a lot of water.
I know that.
Right?

1412
01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:36.390
I have a buddy that is the medical,
uh,
he does stuff with rats and cocaine.

1413
01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.980
He doesn't get drug tested funny cause you're around every day.

1414
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:43.500
He has.
And cocaine,
you know,

1415
01:19:43.501 --> 01:19:47.430
there's a big problem with doctors and doctors getting addicted to drugs.

1416
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:49.830
There's a book called dead doctors don't lie.

1417
01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:54.300
And it's all about how little information doctors know about nutrition and how

1418
01:19:54.301 --> 01:19:58.230
little information they're given and med school about nutrition and how many of

1419
01:19:58.231 --> 01:20:01.620
them wind up getting addicted to prescription drugs and all the shit that can

1420
01:20:01.621 --> 01:20:05.760
prescribe for themselves.
You know,
it's fucking a lot man.
You know,

1421
01:20:05.761 --> 01:20:08.130
you think about how many doctors are out there and they're buddies

1422
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:10.800
<v 6>with other doctors like,
hey man,
I need a script for this.
You know,</v>

1423
01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:13.200
I'll hook you up with some Xanax.

1424
01:20:13.210 --> 01:20:17.430
And one of the medications I got from my stomach acid,

1425
01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:20.670
I was supposed to be approved by insurance company because it has to get

1426
01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:23.710
specially approved because one of its,
uh,
uh,

1427
01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:27.240
things that happens when you take it,
it makes it test positive for THC.

1428
01:20:27.930 --> 01:20:31.710
What makes you test positive?
Wow.

1429
01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:35.940
Well you should tell your the insurance company that you have to test positive

1430
01:20:35.941 --> 01:20:40.740
for THC for your job.
He works for me and that's what I require.

1431
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:44.010
I don't require a positive piss test if he's out there,
you know,

1432
01:20:44.011 --> 01:20:46.260
making creative shit and making videos and stuff.

1433
01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.170
I don't want them a little bit hard.
Brian,

1434
01:20:49.171 --> 01:20:53.900
I look your sexy a businessman jacket.
It's just a new look with the woman.

1435
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:56.310
So what it is,
I had breakfast with three women last night,

1436
01:20:56.311 --> 01:20:58.920
really breakfast with three women last night this morning.

1437
01:20:59.190 --> 01:21:03.810
Eaten eggs and fucking I six at six boobs spending the night last night.

1438
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:06.600
Really?
You have three chicks over your house and where they sleep?

1439
01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:08.760
<v 3>Yeah.
Real talk.</v>

1440
01:21:10.930 --> 01:21:13.860
Did I buy you and all your girlfriends breakfast this morning?

1441
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:19.020
Had to really talk.
Didn't you have two other pictures over my house?

1442
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:22.770
We'll talk.
Wow.

1443
01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:25.830
What's the difference if I found two other ones when I'm out by myself,
Brian,

1444
01:21:25.831 --> 01:21:29.760
what's it like going from zero to hero?
Very nice.

1445
01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:31.740
Tell us,
tell us all about it.

1446
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.990
<v 6>Oh No.</v>

1447
01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:38.490
Did you ever think from the days of living in Ohio that you would be in the

1448
01:21:38.491 --> 01:21:41.310
predicament that you're at now?
Can we even say what predicament you're in now?

1449
01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:46.470
I'm in this.
I wasn't the same predicaments in Ohio.
Not this one.
Son for Ohio.

1450
01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:51.350
The ratio of Ohio.
We're not judging Shah scale son.

1451
01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:55.670
You want to talk about it now?
No.
Okay.
We're going to have to move on.

1452
01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:58.120
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a touchy subject for my mayor.

1453
01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:00.870
I'm dating Lindsay Lohan.

1454
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:04.440
<v 0>No,
he's not laced gentleman.
If he was,
he would definitely not rat her out.</v>

1455
01:22:04.441 --> 01:22:07.680
You'd have to be a serious cut to be date and Lindsay Lohan

1456
01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:16.010
<v 3>and then try to rat her out.
Well,
I'm very mad at her.
Why would you be mad at?</v>

1457
01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:17.740
Because I think she cheated me mean cans.

1458
01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:22.850
Someone checked in Cannes,
you think so?

1459
01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.630
She got a new tattoo supposedly as well for new girlfriend.

1460
01:22:26.690 --> 01:22:29.060
That's why I'm mad about,
so I don't care.
Wow.

1461
01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:33.890
You'll fuck you ass friends.
We'll talk.
I'll try it.

1462
01:22:33.891 --> 01:22:35.480
The fan expo this weekend.
Huh?

1463
01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.110
<v 0>What's the Fanex Oh,
did you?
The UFC fan expo.
Yeah.</v>

1464
01:22:39.250 --> 01:22:43.090
This weekend is a big UFC a rampage versus Rashad.

1465
01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:46.390
That's going to be fucking nuts.
That's a,
that's a sick fight.

1466
01:22:46.690 --> 01:22:51.690
Let's go to the message board to Joe rogan.net the forums and see what I said.

1467
01:22:51.971 --> 01:22:56.380
You were the,
uh,
the winner of season one last comic standing.
I fucked up.

1468
01:22:56.381 --> 01:22:57.820
But this guy sumo,

1469
01:22:58.030 --> 01:23:03.030
he corrected me in the fact police dat is this guy.

1470
01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:06.700
This is the kind questions I get weird motherfuckers.

1471
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:10.840
Is it ignorant to attempt to define the universe in absolutes rather than

1472
01:23:10.841 --> 01:23:14.650
referring to it as a grand mystery or rather the effect,

1473
01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:19.710
the effort to try to define or understand fee an understandable that dude has

1474
01:23:20.071 --> 01:23:23.500
smelly feet for sure.
Right.
An understandable,

1475
01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:26.770
I'm not even gonna answer it just because of that.
You try to sneak that through.

1476
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:29.380
You can't,

1477
01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:32.530
you can't have a legitimate question and have an understandable in that
question.

1478
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:37.120
I'll talk.
You can't use it on infant in front of a word.
That's,

1479
01:23:37.570 --> 01:23:40.030
that shit doesn't make any sense,
but yeah.

1480
01:23:40.031 --> 01:23:43.210
Nobody can define the fucking universe.
It's ridiculous.
We were trying,

1481
01:23:43.211 --> 01:23:48.130
we're struggling.
It's impossible.
Will this be the doom podcast?
Yeah.
This is the,

1482
01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:51.280
um,
the,
I reject your doom podcast.
That's what it is.

1483
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:54.970
It's not the Dune podcast watching that movie collapse and uh,

1484
01:23:54.971 --> 01:23:57.610
I got nervous after I watched it and I thought about it for a while and I was

1485
01:23:57.611 --> 01:24:00.820
thinking about it.
I was like,
this is a trick.

1486
01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:03.190
Like you can think this way,
you know,

1487
01:24:03.191 --> 01:24:06.130
and you can get all fucking flustered and freaked out about the world or you can

1488
01:24:06.131 --> 01:24:07.930
just enjoy the shit out of this.
You know,

1489
01:24:07.931 --> 01:24:10.960
this is some asshole that's sitting around his house saying that is his favorite

1490
01:24:10.961 --> 01:24:14.910
thing to do is walk,
walk his dog on the beach.
Yeah.

1491
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:18.210
It's not the kind of lifted to my prime.

1492
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:20.300
<v 6>Lindsay shits her underwear so much.</v>

1493
01:24:20.301 --> 01:24:23.510
Every time I find them in the bathroom and she has stains all over her underwear

1494
01:24:23.511 --> 01:24:26.060
and she's the first girl I've ever,
you think that's from drugs?

1495
01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:31.030
<v 0>You're a 12 year old.
I was just talking about we really are fucking 12.</v>

1496
01:24:31.210 --> 01:24:34.240
You're not banging.
Lindsay Lohan just shut your mouth.
Meanwhile,

1497
01:24:34.241 --> 01:24:37.750
his girls hotter than Lindsay Lohan.
How ridiculous is that?

1498
01:24:38.170 --> 01:24:41.020
That sounds like a ridiculous statement,
right?
No,
she's hot out.

1499
01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:42.730
That's pretty easy.
She's hot.
Right?

1500
01:24:42.731 --> 01:24:45.610
Ankle is hotter than Lindsay will entertain it.
Whoa.
What are you talking about?

1501
01:24:45.611 --> 01:24:50.230
You went bang a fucking Lindsay Lohan.
She's a mess,
dude.
You wouldn't banger.

1502
01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:55.440
No,
really?
I'd rather Bedfont lakes messes,
right,
don't you?

1503
01:24:55.441 --> 01:24:56.560
You like crazy bitches,
don't you?

1504
01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:00.610
You like them when they're all fucked up a little bit,
right?
Well,

1505
01:25:00.611 --> 01:25:03.280
I mean when you're younger,
sure.
I'm really fucked up.

1506
01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:06.970
Or I should fear arch Felix of suicide bitches.
Oh,
really?
Yeah.

1507
01:25:06.971 --> 01:25:11.470
He likes those jets talking about
suicide girls.

1508
01:25:12.090 --> 01:25:13.460
Oh,
I get you.

1509
01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:18.010
Those girls with all those crazy tattoos and their tits and shit like that.

1510
01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:22.200
<v 6>Porn star Lindsey or a suicide girls.</v>

1511
01:25:23.490 --> 01:25:26.310
<v 0>Pornstar suicide girls.
Yeah,
those dirty bitches.</v>

1512
01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:31.180
It's like bombshell McGee looking girls.
By the way,

1513
01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:33.250
that checks on a fucking cover of a magazine.

1514
01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:38.520
I was at a Barnes and noble yesterday and I'm looking through the magazines and

1515
01:25:38.981 --> 01:25:43.630
inked the magazine right on the fucking cover.
Is that Michelle Bombshell Mcgee?

1516
01:25:43.631 --> 01:25:47.290
That chick that fucked?
Uh,
yeah.
What's his name?
Jesse James.

1517
01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:50.950
She's so hot right now.
She's on the cover of a fucking magazine.

1518
01:25:50.951 --> 01:25:53.550
Just for banging some guy who's famous.
That's the answer.

1519
01:25:53.551 --> 01:25:57.130
I was going to be a correspondent on extra.
Wow.
Yeah.

1520
01:25:57.131 --> 01:26:00.250
The higher they're like,
she does like,
Hey,
I'm recording.

1521
01:26:00.251 --> 01:26:04.580
I'm here with a slut news.
This is what the hired her for real.

1522
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:11.300
Is that really true?
Yeah.
Holy Shit Man.
Wow.
That's incredible.

1523
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:15.680
Is that is really incredible.
Wow.

1524
01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:21.590
That's not a good thing to do man.
I think they did that before with somebody.

1525
01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:24.020
I don't think that's a good precedent to set.
You know,

1526
01:26:24.230 --> 01:26:25.430
this is what I think is going to happen.

1527
01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:30.431
This is my prediction that there's going to be a lot of women who like target,

1528
01:26:30.741 --> 01:26:35.740
like really high profile married guys.
You know,
like you know like Gosh,

1529
01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.200
they're going to get you some attention and that's a big career move.
You know,

1530
01:26:39.201 --> 01:26:42.380
look at all these chicks and fuck tiger woods.
If it wasn't so many of them.

1531
01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.920
There's like tiger woods bank.
So many of them that it's like they're all,

1532
01:26:45.921 --> 01:26:49.820
you can't keep track of them.
They're all like,
I was talking with his mistress.

1533
01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:54.890
Okay.
Which one were you sour then?
I worked at the Bagel Hut,

1534
01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:57.930
you know what I mean?
It's like,
you know,
you're like,
oh,

1535
01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:00.440
it's like there's so many of them.
It's,
it's,

1536
01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:02.960
I'm trying to think about what is another,

1537
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:07.700
another example that's like that you know of that many?
Yeah,

1538
01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:11.870
it's like it deludes it either way.
It's like there's so many of them.

1539
01:27:11.871 --> 01:27:13.760
If there was only one chick that stood out,

1540
01:27:13.761 --> 01:27:18.500
like I know a couple of names like Rachel Yucatel and Jamie grubs.

1541
01:27:18.501 --> 01:27:19.430
Those are the names that I know.

1542
01:27:19.431 --> 01:27:21.670
Those are the only ones that I know those girls get through it.

1543
01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.850
But if there's only one of them,

1544
01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:26.390
that pitch would be super fucking famous right now.
Like that Rachel,

1545
01:27:26.391 --> 01:27:29.240
you should tell is pretty famous cause she's,
first of all,

1546
01:27:29.241 --> 01:27:32.060
she's very pretty and she's the one who didn't talk.

1547
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:35.390
So there's all this speculation that she got paid off and Gloria Allred is her

1548
01:27:35.391 --> 01:27:38.930
attorney and all that jazz.
So I think,
you know,

1549
01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:43.460
I think chickshaw looking at this now like really fucking scandalous,
you know,

1550
01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:46.880
nasty bitches are looking at this as like a possible career path.

1551
01:27:46.881 --> 01:27:48.890
I think a lot of them are right.
What you see,

1552
01:27:48.891 --> 01:27:53.650
like everyone who just got busted with that dude from um,
uh,

1553
01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:57.180
transformers,
the guy who can make the Virgie no.

1554
01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:01.520
Oh Josh do how he got a,
he got a lap dance from some chick.
Remember?

1555
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:03.890
Then she was on the news saying he got a lap dance with me.

1556
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:04.820
It was touching my ass.

1557
01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:09.130
It was like hilarious to give a lap dances and not say anything.

1558
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:14.360
That's the job.
But she said she fucked him.
Oh,
he tried or or something?
Yeah,

1559
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:18.170
I thought she said she fucked him.
I think she said Shit.
You know who you know?

1560
01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:22.350
Anybody can say anything man.
That's the thing.
A guy could say fucked you.

1561
01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:23.940
You know,
unless you,

1562
01:28:24.170 --> 01:28:26.810
unless you have a video tape of all the time you were with him.
It's like,

1563
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:30.670
how the hell do you know?
You know,
it's impossible.
You know.

1564
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:35.510
How do you feel about the only government intervention into the BP oil disaster

1565
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:41.120
is telling the people that we're collecting here to put on into hose and to use

1566
01:28:41.121 --> 01:28:41.721
it.
The Sop up,

1567
01:28:41.721 --> 01:28:45.240
the oil that already come into the marshes that they cannot use it.
Huh?

1568
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:46.760
Is that true?
You know,

1569
01:28:46.761 --> 01:28:50.210
I don't think there's a way to clean up that oil men there.
They got a real,
real,

1570
01:28:50.211 --> 01:28:51.440
real big problem right now.

1571
01:28:51.441 --> 01:28:54.800
The surface of the oil spill is the size of the state of Maryland.

1572
01:28:55.100 --> 01:29:00.080
You don't have bananas.
That is,
oops.
I said,
ah,
fuck.
That's a crazy thing,

1573
01:29:00.081 --> 01:29:02.070
man.
To have a,
a giant oil

1574
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:04.530
<v 7>slick the size of a state and getting larger.
I mean,</v>

1575
01:29:04.531 --> 01:29:08.040
you could see that from a distance satellite now.
You know,
that's,

1576
01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:11.400
that's terrifying that they don't know how to stop it.
I mean,

1577
01:29:11.401 --> 01:29:16.401
it literally might drain the entire 50 million barrels that's in that,

1578
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:19.650
that thing that,
that,
that reservoir of oil,

1579
01:29:19.651 --> 01:29:22.640
that's what the estimate is 15 minutes later.
It's funny,

1580
01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:26.400
they were talking about Straw.
The other do the pressure of that oil coming out,

1581
01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:29.280
you know,
a mile underwater or however fucking deep it is.

1582
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:33.330
The pressure of that oil pumping out like that to be able to contain it,

1583
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:36.450
you have to have some intense fucking machinery.

1584
01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:40.110
You have to have some really big time,
high pressure shit.

1585
01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.710
And they never planned for this.
They have no idea how they're going to stop it.

1586
01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:45.210
They would literally have no idea.

1587
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:49.470
And when you hear Obama talking about it on TV,
it's Ha Larry's,

1588
01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:52.070
cause he's just talking shit.
He's just saying,
you know,

1589
01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:56.070
we're going to clean it up to blow it up.
What's that going to do?
Make more oil,

1590
01:29:56.620 --> 01:30:00.000
more oil is going to come out,
man cave in the whole stuff.

1591
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:02.840
I think part of it is they don't want to,
they don't want,

1592
01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.880
they don't want to do that because they don't want to destroy all the work.

1593
01:30:05.970 --> 01:30:10.970
So they're trying to figure out how to save as much of the well as they can

1594
01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:12.780
while figuring out how to stop it.

1595
01:30:12.781 --> 01:30:15.540
But in the meantime they have this giant eco disaster and they're like,
well,

1596
01:30:15.541 --> 01:30:16.530
we're going to take care of that.

1597
01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:19.650
But the problem with them taking care of that as these people can't fish there,

1598
01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:23.910
they've shut down like 20% of the fishing in the Gulf or at least as of a couple

1599
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:26.160
of days ago.
It might be even worse now.
But all these people,

1600
01:30:26.161 --> 01:30:30.510
they're all fucked up from Katrina and that whole area got nailed by,
you know,

1601
01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:35.010
by those disasters and those just starting to get back on the road to recovery

1602
01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:37.920
and then this fucking thing hits him,
dude,

1603
01:30:37.921 --> 01:30:41.250
this is going to be an eco disaster that we have never seen before.

1604
01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:44.550
Sometimes it's hard to put things in perspective while they're happening,

1605
01:30:44.970 --> 01:30:48.150
you know,
like this is happening right now and it seems like,
you know,

1606
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.840
it doesn't seem like a big deal because it's not affecting our ordinary everyday

1607
01:30:51.841 --> 01:30:54.630
life.
You know,
we're going through life and you know,
it doesn't seem like,

1608
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:57.580
you know what I'm saying?
You know,
you drive to the same store,

1609
01:30:57.581 --> 01:30:58.800
you eat at the same restaurants,
right?

1610
01:30:58.950 --> 01:31:03.420
But there's a part of the world right now that is literally an apocalyptic

1611
01:31:03.421 --> 01:31:07.470
disaster is going down.
I mean,
it is a huge,

1612
01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:12.500
huge fucking reservoir of oil is pumping into the water and it's almost

1613
01:31:12.631 --> 01:31:17.400
impossible to get it out of there.
They're fucked.
That's scary shit,
man.

1614
01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.301
It's just not,

1615
01:31:18.301 --> 01:31:20.820
we're not putting it into perspective because it's not happening to us.

1616
01:31:20.821 --> 01:31:22.920
We're not feeling it,
you know?
So it's like,

1617
01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:26.250
it feels almost abstract when we're talking about it.
You know,

1618
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:28.110
you see it on the news and it seems tragic,

1619
01:31:28.111 --> 01:31:30.480
but it almost seems abstract because it's not affecting you.

1620
01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:31.800
But if that was affecting us,

1621
01:31:31.801 --> 01:31:35.030
if we were fishermen and we were living in fucking Louisiana,
and this is what,

1622
01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:38.640
you would be suicidal right now,
you'd be going crazy.

1623
01:31:38.850 --> 01:31:40.830
You have no other way to make a living.
Do you have kids to feed?

1624
01:31:40.831 --> 01:31:43.850
You have no fucking money in the bank and this shit is going down.
Yeah.
And,

1625
01:31:43.870 --> 01:31:47.540
and things probably weren't that well off for you before it happened,
either.
You,

1626
01:31:47.610 --> 01:31:50.130
you know,
for the most part,
those guys are pretty,
yeah,

1627
01:31:50.131 --> 01:31:53.760
we're all this bailout money.
All these billions and billions of dollars,

1628
01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:58.680
those fucking cock suckers should be paying those fishermen right now.

1629
01:31:58.830 --> 01:32:02.260
They should be sending fat checks in the mail right now.

1630
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:05.710
Double what they were making before so that they don't have to feel bad.

1631
01:32:06.010 --> 01:32:08.410
You know,
because you're,
you're killing their fucking business.

1632
01:32:08.530 --> 01:32:12.580
Billions of dollars to these fucks is not that much money and $1 billion would

1633
01:32:12.581 --> 01:32:16.480
go a long fucking way to taking care of all these fishermen.
I mean,
it's a,

1634
01:32:16.481 --> 01:32:19.360
it's a billion dollar industry,
but you know this,

1635
01:32:19.361 --> 01:32:22.390
this catastrophe is going to cost him so much fucking money.

1636
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:26.350
They should take out the money for the fishermen and for the workers right now,

1637
01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:29.170
for all the fucking people that rely on tourism,

1638
01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:33.250
all the people in this kind of be big dude.
It's going to be gigantic.

1639
01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:36.070
And then there's the cleanup and then they're going to have to come up with new

1640
01:32:36.071 --> 01:32:37.900
technology to even clean that shit up.

1641
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.870
<v 2>See,
Kevin Costner had a,
had a thing that he might use.
His is what?
His hair?</v>

1642
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:47.290
No,
when he Kevin Costner and,
and I'm getting,
a lot of us are wrong.

1643
01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:51.070
Back when he did waterworld he got into completely overestimated how much area?

1644
01:32:51.071 --> 01:32:54.670
Yeah,
he got into cleaning up the ocean or the oil.

1645
01:32:54.671 --> 01:32:59.671
So in he spent $25 million in 15 years of research into this filtering system

1646
01:33:00.130 --> 01:33:02.710
that now the government is like,
well wait a minute,
you have that.

1647
01:33:02.711 --> 01:33:07.360
We didn't know that they're going to use Kevin Costner's.
What?
Yeah,

1648
01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:08.630
if you Google it,
he,

1649
01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:12.730
he created some thing back when he did wild world to help the ocean and now

1650
01:33:12.731 --> 01:33:13.050
there's,

1651
01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:16.960
it's supposed to like annoy the oil batteries just to do something to the oil

1652
01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:22.060
show.
I'm really bad oil commit suicide and you want to say,

1653
01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:28.120
we play the sound track from Tin Cup.

1654
01:33:28.570 --> 01:33:31.870
How the fuck are they going to separate that water in the oil?
I mean,

1655
01:33:31.871 --> 01:33:33.970
they're all talking about how they're going to do it.
Oh,
we're going to do it.

1656
01:33:33.971 --> 01:33:37.510
They're going to literally going to have to invent some new technology in order

1657
01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:41.290
to,
to just,
I can't believe they didn't have a plan.

1658
01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:44.430
You know?
Yeah.

1659
01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:47.590
Better than just what I would've done at my apartment where you just get a rug

1660
01:33:47.591 --> 01:33:51.160
and throw it over the spot that's on the cat litter.
It's done.

1661
01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:53.530
I'm not going to pay to clean.
That kept us up.

1662
01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:57.063
What the fuck?

1663
01:33:57.570 --> 01:34:00.730
They should just be other drop like the Statue of Liberty on it or something and

1664
01:34:00.731 --> 01:34:05.320
stop.
It's like just like
a mile underwater.
Yeah.

1665
01:34:05.321 --> 01:34:09.070
This is where a superhero is definitely Nivo miles underwater.
Right.

1666
01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:12.200
<v 7>Little tiny robots that we can barely control.</v>

1667
01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:16.460
You're talking about hundreds of thousands of pounds of pressure.

1668
01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:19.070
You know what I mean?
This,
this,
this pump,

1669
01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:23.540
it was pumping out insane amounts of oil and now it's just broken from an

1670
01:34:23.541 --> 01:34:26.990
explosion and it's pouring.
Have you ever seen the live feed?

1671
01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:29.780
Have you seen the live feed yet?
It's creepy as fuck.
Dude.

1672
01:34:29.781 --> 01:34:31.430
CNN had a live feed for a while,

1673
01:34:31.431 --> 01:34:34.090
but it crushed her servers because everybody was just sitting in front of it's

1674
01:34:34.091 --> 01:34:38.120
staring and it's just the oil.
Did slack jaw just pouring?
Well,

1675
01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:42.250
it was interesting because the guy that was the,
um,
um,

1676
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:46.130
one of the experts it was on CNN was explaining that from that video,

1677
01:34:46.131 --> 01:34:50.630
he showed that it wasn't the 5,000 gallons or barrels of oil a day.

1678
01:34:50.631 --> 01:34:51.950
They were estimating it was coming out.

1679
01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:55.250
He said it was literally like 75 to 100,000,

1680
01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:58.070
and he was being conservative by saying 5,000

1681
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:01.220
<v 0>barrels.
He's like,
it's an insane amount of oil.
Like this ain't,</v>

1682
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.870
this ain't 5,000 barrels.
You know,
it's like,
I'll fuck load.

1683
01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:10.020
<v 2>Hmm.
I like oil.</v>

1684
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:14.220
<v 0>It's fucking awesome when it works.
Not so awesome when it gets in your ocean,</v>

1685
01:35:14.710 --> 01:35:17.750
<v 1>that fleshlight oil that comes with those flashlights or you can get with this</v>

1686
01:35:17.751 --> 01:35:18.950
flash lights.
It's very good.

1687
01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:21.373
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

1688
01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:26.390
<v 1>Flashlight oil.
Yeah.
They have like a hot and cold and just normal.</v>

1689
01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:27.300
And uh,

1690
01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:31.010
it's good for you even when you're not using the flashlight for using for sex.

1691
01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:31.300
Right.

1692
01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:34.130
<v 0>Good for about an hour and then he fucking completely falls apart.
Well,</v>

1693
01:35:34.190 --> 01:35:37.030
it's better than silence.
You're straight.
You're surfing the net.

1694
01:35:37.031 --> 01:35:38.680
So I'm just asking questions here,
son.

1695
01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:43.560
<v 2>All right.
The doom and gloom.</v>

1696
01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:47.330
<v 0>This is what is keeping people well this is a problem and it's just like what we</v>

1697
01:35:47.331 --> 01:35:51.470
were talking about with um,
with negative people online.

1698
01:35:51.870 --> 01:35:56.010
People gravitate towards negative stories and you know,
I mean we're,

1699
01:35:56.011 --> 01:35:58.640
we're guilty of it talking about this oil spill that's more of a catastrophe

1700
01:35:58.641 --> 01:36:00.200
than anything but this,
this,

1701
01:36:00.201 --> 01:36:04.640
this collapse thing because this has been a subject on my message board for the

1702
01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:07.420
past couple of days because the Michael Rupert Documentary and because uh,

1703
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:08.510
somebody put a,
um,

1704
01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:13.220
a speech that he was giving and in Vermont and that was also on the message

1705
01:36:13.221 --> 01:36:15.800
board and that's been a subject that people been talking about.

1706
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:20.180
But that's something that people completely fixate on and I'm totally guilty of

1707
01:36:20.181 --> 01:36:20.570
it.

1708
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:25.570
I fixated on it for hours yesterday and it didn't help me at all and I'm trying

1709
01:36:25.821 --> 01:36:27.560
to figure out why the fuck people do that.

1710
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:32.830
Why do we get so obsessed with like the unavoidable catastrophes and the

1711
01:36:33.771 --> 01:36:35.690
unavoidable like that,
like death.

1712
01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:39.170
I mean you can sit around all day and freak the fuck out about the fact that

1713
01:36:39.171 --> 01:36:42.410
eventually your is going to give up and quit and you're going to move on to the

1714
01:36:42.411 --> 01:36:43.490
next stage of existence.

1715
01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:48.760
Why is it though that that can stop you from actually enjoying your time that

1716
01:36:49.161 --> 01:36:51.740
you have?
Like what?
What the fuck?
What is it about pinball?

1717
01:36:52.150 --> 01:36:53.830
It's whatever you're focused on.
If you,

1718
01:36:53.831 --> 01:36:58.370
your brain is like a Google and you type in world destruction,

1719
01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:02.300
you're going to find all the links and videos and everything that has to do with

1720
01:37:02.301 --> 01:37:07.301
world construction and that your brain can only handle so many questions or so

1721
01:37:07.401 --> 01:37:09.230
many things that you're looking for.

1722
01:37:09.710 --> 01:37:12.680
This is one of the dudes on the message board rivalries talking about the Gulf

1723
01:37:12.681 --> 01:37:15.320
oil spill it and he's saying that the oil coming out as under so much pressure

1724
01:37:15.321 --> 01:37:16.490
that they can't cap it.

1725
01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:21.740
It's eroded the piping 300 feet below the sea floor and allowed oil to escape

1726
01:37:21.741 --> 01:37:23.660
out of the seabed at different spots.

1727
01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:28.490
Plus they think there might be a volcano under there.
What Duff?

1728
01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:30.270
<v 1>Fuck Bob Kane.</v>

1729
01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:35.040
Fucking Christ in the volcano has aids.

1730
01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:40.160
<v 0>Oh my God.
Congress is going to approve a 400% increase in the gasoline tax.</v>

1731
01:37:41.690 --> 01:37:43.910
There's more doom.
I want to shut that off.
I don't want to read it.

1732
01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:48.800
It's just loss.
No,
no.
I'm so far behind on last,
man.

1733
01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:51.740
Are you going to catch up?
And I'm going to eventually catch up,
but I'm,
I'm way,

1734
01:37:51.741 --> 01:37:55.770
way,
way,
way,
way,
way,
way behind.
So did you read anything about what happened?
No,

1735
01:37:55.771 --> 01:37:58.950
I don't want to hear shit,
so I'm it was it good?
I heard it sucked.

1736
01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.730
<v 6>You know,
at first I was more,
I mean it was okay,</v>

1737
01:38:01.731 --> 01:38:05.000
but the first time I was kind of like upset about it and now I'm kind of like,

1738
01:38:05.001 --> 01:38:08.300
you know what?
That's probably about as good as it was going to get anywhere.

1739
01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:11.160
<v 0>A lot of people were bummed out about the sopranos ending and I don't have a</v>

1740
01:38:11.161 --> 01:38:13.350
problem with that.
I didn't think it was the best thing in the world,

1741
01:38:13.351 --> 01:38:16.770
but I didn't,
I didn't feel like they fucked up.
I felt like it was just like,

1742
01:38:16.771 --> 01:38:20.280
how do you end such a spectacular show?
Like you got to,

1743
01:38:20.290 --> 01:38:23.700
it was cool how they just ends abruptly and then that that's what happened to

1744
01:38:23.701 --> 01:38:26.820
him.
Well No,
I mean,
yeah,
who knows?
Who knows what it is.

1745
01:38:26.821 --> 01:38:29.310
I mean it's open to interpretation.
Did he die?
You know,

1746
01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:33.380
that's the best show I think I've ever watched from beginning to end.

1747
01:38:33.381 --> 01:38:37.170
So Toronto's is number one to me and you see it morph and change because the

1748
01:38:37.171 --> 01:38:39.030
very first episode was almost like a comedy.

1749
01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:42.480
You remember his wife came out with a machine gun and she saw somebody who was

1750
01:38:42.481 --> 01:38:44.430
climbing into the window and I was like,
remember that?

1751
01:38:44.670 --> 01:38:47.010
I don't remember the first one.
Yeah,
it was almost like a comedy.

1752
01:38:47.011 --> 01:38:50.010
It's like they were,
they were playing it like not real,
you know,

1753
01:38:50.011 --> 01:38:51.450
they're playing it like,
like silly.

1754
01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:55.380
But then as the season went on and it got more and more serious than,

1755
01:38:55.381 --> 01:38:58.170
than as episodes,
the seasons went on,
then it,
you know,

1756
01:38:58.171 --> 01:39:01.290
it became this intense fucking incredible trauma.
But man,

1757
01:39:01.291 --> 01:39:04.890
is there ever been a fucking show that makes you so excited to see it like that?

1758
01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:06.750
I've never been so addicted to a show.
Is this

1759
01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:08.810
<v 6>Ross loss was like that mean?
Yeah.</v>

1760
01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:10.880
I mean there's a couple of episodes I didn't like,

1761
01:39:10.881 --> 01:39:14.060
but the whole getting to the end part,
I loved every second of it.

1762
01:39:14.061 --> 01:39:18.320
I mean I rewatched the whole entire show from beginning to end in the last three

1763
01:39:18.321 --> 01:39:21.320
nights.
You know what?
But I loved it.

1764
01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:25.400
I watched every episode just like it was the first time and I was like,

1765
01:39:25.401 --> 01:39:25.790
oh my God.

1766
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:28.520
Cause there's all these new things now that you know certain things and you

1767
01:39:28.521 --> 01:39:31.250
rewatch the episode,
you're like,
wow,
that's crazy.

1768
01:39:31.410 --> 01:39:33.600
<v 0>It is a very well made show.
Very well me,</v>

1769
01:39:33.601 --> 01:39:36.300
even though I gave up on it this season,
I just got bored with it.

1770
01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:38.880
I got bored with it because I felt like there's so many times when they were

1771
01:39:38.881 --> 01:39:42.240
like guns pointed at them and Jack was like all nonchalant.

1772
01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:47.310
Jack was fucking phone and then man after a while Jack seems like he just gave

1773
01:39:47.311 --> 01:39:47.750
up.

1774
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:49.610
<v 6>Well,
there's a whole thing with Jack Man.
What's,</v>

1775
01:39:49.611 --> 01:39:50.990
especially once you see the last episode,

1776
01:39:50.991 --> 01:39:53.180
you're going to think different about Jack to begin with.

1777
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:56.950
<v 0>Oh,
how dare you in the big,</v>

1778
01:39:56.980 --> 01:40:00.490
from the beginning he was a different guy and then they turned him into a junkie

1779
01:40:00.730 --> 01:40:03.390
and then after they turned him into a junkie,
he seemed to be phoning it in it.

1780
01:40:03.550 --> 01:40:05.740
<v 6>I can't tell you this,
this cause this doesn't ruin anything,</v>

1781
01:40:05.741 --> 01:40:09.250
but I was kind of upset that there was certain characters and things that they

1782
01:40:09.251 --> 01:40:11.290
never did get to.

1783
01:40:11.291 --> 01:40:15.070
And I don't know if it was because of the actual actors or what,
like Mr Echo,

1784
01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:15.933
remember that guy?
Yeah.

1785
01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:19.480
Whatever happened to him while he didn't want to come back.
That's what happened.

1786
01:40:19.481 --> 01:40:23.800
Right.
Walt had superpowers,
you know,
and they were like,
oh,
what's so special?

1787
01:40:23.890 --> 01:40:27.220
Well then I read that Walt was taken off the show because he grew like three

1788
01:40:27.221 --> 01:40:30.610
times the height and like one season and they couldn't do that.

1789
01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:31.780
So they had to take him off the show.

1790
01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:34.690
So did they just take him off the show and forget the whole plot of him having

1791
01:40:34.691 --> 01:40:36.820
special powers or was there something I'm not thinking of?

1792
01:40:37.290 --> 01:40:41.880
<v 0>Yeah,
they just dropped it.
I felt like just fucking is a problem.</v>

1793
01:40:42.690 --> 01:40:45.900
Let's just never bring it up.
Ever.
Yeah.
Like this is ridiculous.

1794
01:40:46.650 --> 01:40:49.820
After a while they just say,
you know,
no one's going to remember.

1795
01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:54.050
<v 6>That's whole Combo is so good.
You know?
The whole journey was good that I,</v>

1796
01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:56.900
<v 0>I'm not going to hate the ending because the whole show is good.
You know?</v>

1797
01:40:57.010 --> 01:40:58.050
It's one of the best shows.
Okay.

1798
01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:01.270
It was definitely one of the best shows ever and most complicated show ever on

1799
01:41:01.271 --> 01:41:05.080
TV.
Most difficult to follow.
I just got bored with it after the last season.

1800
01:41:05.081 --> 01:41:06.790
It's like,
seemed like they were just making shit up.
Oh,

1801
01:41:06.791 --> 01:41:08.800
now we're going back in time again.
Boom,

1802
01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:11.650
I'm going to blow off a nuke and we're going to go back in time like,
come on.

1803
01:41:11.651 --> 01:41:15.250
Really it's that easy to just go back in time.
I could come on,

1804
01:41:15.251 --> 01:41:17.170
this is fucking foolishness.

1805
01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:20.920
There's definitely things I didn't like about it and still so mysterious and so

1806
01:41:20.921 --> 01:41:24.870
elaborate and so it felt like so cheap to me that that was how you're going to

1807
01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:25.720
do it.
You're going to,

1808
01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:29.290
she's going to bang on a nuclear bomb and it's going to blow up and everyone's

1809
01:41:29.291 --> 01:41:33.340
going to go back in time and she falls hundreds of feet down to a well and she

1810
01:41:33.341 --> 01:41:36.910
survives and has enough strength to bang on his fucking nuclear weapon and blow

1811
01:41:36.911 --> 01:41:41.350
it up.
Really?
Really.
It's like it's such a goddamn good show and you got to that

1812
01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:45.220
Battlestar Galactica was awesome up until the last season.

1813
01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:47.530
I want to see the wire.
I got boy.
Yeah,

1814
01:41:47.531 --> 01:41:50.290
the wires and another one that everybody recommended.
Madmen.

1815
01:41:50.291 --> 01:41:53.710
Dexter was awesome for a few seasons.
I got bored with Dexter.

1816
01:41:53.890 --> 01:41:56.920
I got bored with Dexter when John Lithgow was the bad guy.
I was like,

1817
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:58.090
and he got this chicken,

1818
01:41:58.091 --> 01:42:02.230
a shitty rear naked choke and choked her and I was like

1819
01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:08.710
the real,
did he,
the last episode was last night,
right?
Yeah.

1820
01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.130
Was it good?
I haven't watched 24 since the first season,

1821
01:42:12.131 --> 01:42:15.250
but I was caught up after two hours and saw how it ended and went.
Okay.

1822
01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:18.040
I'm sure you know.
Was it good?
I liked it.

1823
01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:22.390
You know for an Andy like choked out as friends.
Those photo shows,
man.

1824
01:42:22.450 --> 01:42:27.250
The problem with those shows people choked out.
Chloe [inaudible] girl.

1825
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:30.100
Really?
That's weird.
That's Duncan's old girlfriend.

1826
01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:33.100
Mary Lynn Duncan Trussell used to live with it.

1827
01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:36.070
When does she kicked him out and Duncan that a live with me for months.

1828
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:39.960
It was still uncomfortable going over from when I first moved out here.

1829
01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:41.170
Does stand up.
Yeah.

1830
01:42:41.171 --> 01:42:44.080
When I first moved out here and this agent was trying to get me into the

1831
01:42:44.081 --> 01:42:47.860
alternative scene,
it was all those guys.
I didn't go that route,

1832
01:42:48.630 --> 01:42:52.300
the alternative scene,
but he was like,
you're,
you should hang out with a genie.

1833
01:42:52.301 --> 01:42:54.910
Graffel oh,
I was just talking with a friend of mine about that.

1834
01:42:54.911 --> 01:42:59.350
The alternative scene is mostly in,
in a lot of people,
so I was like,

1835
01:42:59.351 --> 01:43:02.480
people were trying to do smart comedy and people who are like,
you know,

1836
01:43:02.590 --> 01:43:07.060
trying to do something.
That's off the beaten path and they're like more nerds,

1837
01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:09.070
right?
That's how people like look at them.
You know,

1838
01:43:09.071 --> 01:43:12.100
people were proud to be nerds.
I do alternative comedy.
Meanwhile,

1839
01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:15.430
I can't think of more people who do that.

1840
01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:19.090
They pretend they don't know you thing.
Then alternative comics,

1841
01:43:19.330 --> 01:43:22.390
more people who are into social climbing.
Then alternative comics.

1842
01:43:22.391 --> 01:43:27.120
There are more Hollywood,
Hollywood then,
then the regular comics.

1843
01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.890
It's hilarious.
It's like,
what's the alternative?
The attorneys,

1844
01:43:29.891 --> 01:43:31.210
you're going to be ultra Hollywood.

1845
01:43:31.390 --> 01:43:35.710
I have seen so many comics that are alternative comics.
Do that.

1846
01:43:35.711 --> 01:43:40.120
Pretend I don't know you.
Um,
did we meet,
you know,
I'm the,
I'm sorry,

1847
01:43:40.121 --> 01:43:42.780
what's your name?
Like that fake shit that they like.

1848
01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:46.240
Like it's a cool thing to not know your name or something like that.

1849
01:43:46.241 --> 01:43:48.280
I've seen that happen with so many people.
The whole funny,

1850
01:43:48.281 --> 01:43:51.920
different vibe or you see a lot of these guys be very judgmental.
It the APP,

1851
01:43:51.921 --> 01:43:52.040
their

1852
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.490
<v 7>notebooks and all their jokes are written down and then they get up and they're</v>

1853
01:43:55.491 --> 01:43:58.930
like,
yeah,
the stuff you do,
it's just not real.
It's like you,

1854
01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:03.290
you are totally scripted out every word you said.
You know,
even if they don't,

1855
01:44:03.291 --> 01:44:06.140
I mean,
I don't give a fuck of your scripted out,
or if you're loose and rambling,

1856
01:44:06.141 --> 01:44:09.650
I don't care.
It's like,
well,
just do whatever is in you.
You know,
whatever.

1857
01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:13.580
Everybody has a different style and some people tell joke jokes and some people,

1858
01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:17.030
you know,
they're like storytellers and some people that just shit talkers.

1859
01:44:17.031 --> 01:44:21.290
You know,
everyone's got their own style of doing comedy.
It's just the idea of,

1860
01:44:21.291 --> 01:44:25.010
you know,
yours being better,
or are you being judgemental because you know,

1861
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:27.980
with,
with some alternative guys,

1862
01:44:27.981 --> 01:44:32.981
they don't like people who put too much energy in people were too loud people or

1863
01:44:33.081 --> 01:44:36.650
whatever.
Yeah.
It's like you don't,
I'd like that.
I like being entertained.

1864
01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:39.430
I like a guy who has a lot of energy,
you know,
like,

1865
01:44:39.550 --> 01:44:44.150
like a cat Williams type dude.
I,
I,
I enjoy watching his comedy.
It's fun to me.

1866
01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:49.280
So like,
you know,
these guys that like that shit on people for trying too hard.

1867
01:44:49.281 --> 01:44:51.150
It's like,
wow,
that's like you,

1868
01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:55.010
you want to create this weird environment where everyone's like super calm and

1869
01:44:55.011 --> 01:44:57.860
like goes to whole foods.
You know?
It's like,
you know what I mean?

1870
01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:02.390
It's like some weird vibe that you're trying to create with alternative comedy.

1871
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:08.150
<v 6>So what's going on with this?
Got to see it this weekend when he's excited.</v>

1872
01:45:09.310 --> 01:45:10.840
<v 7>That's fascinating.
That's a good one.</v>

1873
01:45:10.841 --> 01:45:14.230
So a lot of shit talking going on rampage Jackson and Rashad Evans had been shit

1874
01:45:14.231 --> 01:45:17.740
talking each other for fucking months man.
That's what's crazy about it.

1875
01:45:17.741 --> 01:45:22.420
They'd been talking shit to each other for like almost a year if not more.

1876
01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:27.750
I mean it happened when rampage fought Keith Jardeen and that was a long fucking

1877
01:45:28.061 --> 01:45:32.740
time ago and Rashad gotten the octagon after rampage.

1878
01:45:32.741 --> 01:45:34.660
One was talking all kinds of crazy shit.

1879
01:45:34.661 --> 01:45:38.830
And then of course they're on the ultimate fighter together for the whole season

1880
01:45:38.831 --> 01:45:42.850
and they didn't fight after that.
And then it's a lot of fucking shit.

1881
01:45:42.970 --> 01:45:46.120
A lot of shit happened.
They're supposed to find rampage,

1882
01:45:46.121 --> 01:45:49.240
how to get jaw surgery and then they're supposed to fight after the ultimate

1883
01:45:49.241 --> 01:45:52.480
fighter.
But rampage got a,
an awesome movie role

1884
01:45:52.610 --> 01:45:56.880
<v 6>did his movie's about to come out to tank.
So it's going to be interesting.
Well,</v>

1885
01:45:56.890 --> 01:45:59.290
I think it's going to tank.
It's the fucking a team.

1886
01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:03.070
It's just gonna be like Gi Joe.
You are fucking wrong.

1887
01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:06.640
You're going to kill how much you wanna bet.
How much do I have?
20 bucks.

1888
01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:09.370
20 bucks.
I want you to feel all right,

1889
01:46:09.371 --> 01:46:11.350
so it has to be number one for how many weeks in a row

1890
01:46:11.410 --> 01:46:14.480
<v 7>we number one to not tank.
It just has to not tank</v>

1891
01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:19.160
<v 6>just to find,
not tanking
number one.</v>

1892
01:46:19.190 --> 01:46:22.700
I didn't to know what tanking means because taking to me it's like fucking
pussy.

1893
01:46:22.701 --> 01:46:25.400
It's 20 bucks.
We're talking about here man.
Be a man.

1894
01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:28.010
But what do you mean by tank?
Because by taking what I mean,

1895
01:46:28.011 --> 01:46:29.930
it's like it's going to get an a second place.

1896
01:46:29.931 --> 01:46:31.770
The first week it's out first place maybe,

1897
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:35.120
but then after that it's just not tanking.
Tanking is,

1898
01:46:35.121 --> 01:46:38.150
it doesn't make the money that it was on a bucks.
It cost to make it.

1899
01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:41.950
That's what tank?
Yes.
I don't know about how much money it's going to make.

1900
01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:44.990
I just think that this is such a huge franchise and they're going to fail it.

1901
01:46:44.991 --> 01:46:47.990
I think it's going to be rotten.
Tomato score is going to be 30,
40%.

1902
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:48.900
There's some movies,
right.

1903
01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:52.530
<v 0>I look at the move and I go,
who the fuck is looking forward to this?</v>

1904
01:46:52.531 --> 01:46:54.900
Like every time there's a Jennifer Lopez moving,
yeah.

1905
01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:58.680
Some Jennifer Lopez Romance Film.
I'm like,
fucking really,

1906
01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:02.280
who is running out going to see that?
Who's all excited?

1907
01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.670
There was a point in time where like Jennifer Lopez was banging out a lot of

1908
01:47:05.671 --> 01:47:09.060
movies and they were like big movies,
you know,
like what was the movie with um,

1909
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:14.100
the,
uh,
the,
the one with prisoners,
the George Clooney movie.

1910
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:18.000
Fucking good movie man.
Do you want talking about,
was it a Coen brothers movie?

1911
01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:22.390
Where Brian,
but I'm trying to think of it.
No,
no,

1912
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:27.470
she wasn't in that mind of yours or some movie where she played a cop and he was

1913
01:47:28.021 --> 01:47:30.240
a bad guy.
Oh,
the sal.

1914
01:47:30.241 --> 01:47:33.600
That's another cool movie that she was in with that fucking crazy dude from

1915
01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:39.750
just those special victims unit CSI or whatever the hell it is.
Law and order.

1916
01:47:40.590 --> 01:47:44.490
Vincent D'onofrio.
Did you ever see the Cell Brian?
Yeah.
Fascinating.

1917
01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:45.820
Fucking awesome.

1918
01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:48.100
<v 6>Did you,
did you get the UFC video game yet?</v>

1919
01:47:48.410 --> 01:47:50.990
<v 0>No.
No.
I haven't gotten a copy.
It's pretty bad ass though.</v>

1920
01:47:50.991 --> 01:47:53.820
I'm sure I can get a copy comes out today,
does it?

1921
01:47:54.110 --> 01:47:56.870
Today's the day or yesterday or the day one of those,
but a,

1922
01:47:56.910 --> 01:47:59.090
it's supposed to be pretty awesome people enjoying the shit out of it.

1923
01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:02.390
<v 6>It's supposed to get better reviews.
Then I the first one I heard</v>

1924
01:48:02.530 --> 01:48:06.040
<v 0>don't open that rotten tomatoes.
I saw that sex and the city thing.</v>

1925
01:48:06.041 --> 01:48:09.310
That was another one.
That's another one that makes me go,

1926
01:48:09.311 --> 01:48:13.360
what is going on with the world that people are loving that movie,
man,

1927
01:48:13.690 --> 01:48:15.730
chicks are so fired up to go see sex in the city.

1928
01:48:16.050 --> 01:48:18.480
<v 6>18 is going to suck.
How do you know it's going to suck?</v>

1929
01:48:18.481 --> 01:48:22.590
Because man do anything right man.
Look what they did.

1930
01:48:22.591 --> 01:48:25.530
The Gi Joe fucking Hollywood,
so it's one person.

1931
01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:28.470
It really is when it comes to Fucker,

1932
01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:33.500
when it comes to retaking old like childhood dreams about iron man,

1933
01:48:33.571 --> 01:48:36.750
iron man,
it's fucking awesome.
You're,
your argument doesn't hold up.

1934
01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:39.130
Your arguments sucks.
No,
no,
I'm not saying everything.

1935
01:48:39.190 --> 01:48:43.200
Everything like marvel lately has been doing okay.

1936
01:48:43.201 --> 01:48:46.550
They did good on Spiderman.
They did okay on x men.
They did okay on Ironman,

1937
01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:49.350
but before that they had captain America.

1938
01:48:49.351 --> 01:48:52.550
They had all these horrible failed attempts.
But then when I'm talking about,

1939
01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:54.750
it's like the shit where they're taking like Gi Joe,

1940
01:48:54.751 --> 01:48:57.930
they're taking transformers and they're just fucking taking our childhood memory

1941
01:48:58.050 --> 01:49:01.020
and shitting on it.
Like every single movie they'd been trying to do.

1942
01:49:01.021 --> 01:49:05.700
Just fucking kids.
They're so sad that karate kid is a good example.

1943
01:49:05.701 --> 01:49:08.340
That's going to do okay,
but still it's not gonna be as good as the original.

1944
01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.010
I saw a lot of people can be CIOs complaining.
Izzy,

1945
01:49:12.690 --> 01:49:17.010
I saw the people complain in that he goes to China and his learning,

1946
01:49:17.011 --> 01:49:21.030
Kung Fu,
it's called karate,
is Japanese.

1947
01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:26.760
Chinese people must be fucking pissed,
but it's called karate kid.
That was a big,

1948
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.200
they gave fucking lips to optimist prime.
Why does a robot need lips?

1949
01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:36.900
You are such a nerd.
You are such a nerd.
I can't believe you're a grown man.

1950
01:49:38.010 --> 01:49:42.650
He really care about that.
Speaking of speaking of nerds,
dude

1951
01:49:42.650 --> 01:49:46.730
<v 0>who,
uh,
was graduating from Columbia and uh,
in his,
uh,</v>

1952
01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:48.040
in speech,

1953
01:49:48.370 --> 01:49:50.260
<v 7>he,
uh,
he hacked a patent,</v>

1954
01:49:50.261 --> 01:49:53.710
Oswald choke and the video got out onto the Internet.

1955
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:57.880
You still want to Patton Oswald's joke in his speech.
Yeah.

1956
01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:02.290
And the comic,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That's another one.
This is a new story.

1957
01:50:02.291 --> 01:50:05.470
This one came out today.
Patton Oswald's joke about star Trek,

1958
01:50:05.530 --> 01:50:09.850
like a physics professor put a star track,
a theme to a question.

1959
01:50:09.851 --> 01:50:14.230
It was basically,
um,
uh,
speed and velocity equation,
you know,

1960
01:50:14.231 --> 01:50:15.310
and the,

1961
01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:19.870
the joke was that he used checkoff fires the phasers and someone came up to him

1962
01:50:19.871 --> 01:50:22.720
and said,
Sulu fires the phasers checkoff doesn't fire the phrase.

1963
01:50:22.930 --> 01:50:26.000
So I had been informed that Sulu and you know,

1964
01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:30.490
so the question didn't make sense and if you go in and just,
but anyway,

1965
01:50:30.491 --> 01:50:34.120
this guy used the exact joke.
I just fucked up that joke royally.

1966
01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:38.460
But this guy used the exact joke in his commencement speech and it caught on on

1967
01:50:38.461 --> 01:50:42.100
youtube and everyone went crazy.
It's on the Gawker,

1968
01:50:42.101 --> 01:50:46.120
it's on defame or all these different websites and Patton Oswald wrote about it

1969
01:50:46.121 --> 01:50:49.420
on his blog.
It's on the front page of his blog.
He went after the dude.

1970
01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:54.160
<v 1>Wait,
so a guy just did it during his commitments.
That's in,
you get paid for it.</v>

1971
01:50:54.161 --> 01:50:58.510
It was just him and he's just doing Harris.
He hacked it.
Who Cares?
Well,

1972
01:50:58.511 --> 01:51:01.780
getting paid for that.
He's just doing a speech.
Well,
patent cared.

1973
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:05.350
Well that's retarded.
Is it retarded?
That's fucking retarded.

1974
01:51:05.410 --> 01:51:08.530
What do you think you should have done?
Patent?
Yeah,
you should have been audited.

1975
01:51:08.531 --> 01:51:11.110
Like,
oh,
that's,
that's cool.
I don't think he said a cared.

1976
01:51:11.170 --> 01:51:14.350
The guy was just doing a speech at his school.
He wasn't getting paid.
He wasn't.

1977
01:51:14.630 --> 01:51:17.590
These people didn't come out to see him get,
you know,
they didn't pay money.

1978
01:51:17.710 --> 01:51:20.560
It's not his career.
He was giving a speech when he graduated.

1979
01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:21.230
<v 7>Right.</v>

1980
01:51:21.230 --> 01:51:26.230
But if that guy is plagiarizing and his graduation speech,

1981
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:29.360
what the fuck did he do throughout his college career?

1982
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:34.510
If he is so brazen that he's willing to plagiarize a famous comedian on video

1983
01:51:35.210 --> 01:51:39.980
and he knows that shit is going to get on the internet or another college
speech,

1984
01:51:39.981 --> 01:51:43.070
I don't get,
dude,
everybody cares.
It's all over the Internet.
It's a big deal.

1985
01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:47.420
You don't want to love about it though,
that everyone's calling it.
He men see it.

1986
01:51:47.421 --> 01:51:51.190
It Ah,
oh,
that's funny.
That's I,
I've read that on three different places

1987
01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:54.500
<v 1>because I heard an interview recently have been Sia and he said the first time</v>

1988
01:51:54.501 --> 01:51:55.790
he ever got on stage,

1989
01:51:55.850 --> 01:51:59.060
he was so nervous that he went to the store and bought a joke book and took

1990
01:51:59.061 --> 01:52:02.450
jokes from it,
ripped out the pages and the first time you went on stage,

1991
01:52:02.710 --> 01:52:04.030
<v 7>oh,
you're talking about the mark man pod.</v>

1992
01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:09.490
<v 1>Yeah.
That was very disappointing as it's like,
that's great.</v>

1993
01:52:09.491 --> 01:52:12.970
Your first time on stage,
you just admitted that you stole from a joke book.

1994
01:52:14.130 --> 01:52:18.750
<v 7>Well,
he told jokes when you buy the joke book,
don't,
don't you own those jokes.</v>

1995
01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:19.673
That's right.

1996
01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:23.430
Not Stealing unless he stole the joke book and then talked about it.

1997
01:52:24.330 --> 01:52:27.690
So yeah,
I think we've said more than enough about that fucking dude.

1998
01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:31.050
It's amazing that people still go to see that guy though.

1999
01:52:31.890 --> 01:52:35.040
You have to be completely retarded or not having an Internet connection.

2000
01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:39.090
I mean those are the only possibilities why you'd want to go see that guy.

2001
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:42.540
Comedy's a funny thing man.
It's like,
you know,

2002
01:52:42.541 --> 01:52:45.830
it's like all art forms kind of reflect where your head's,
you know the car,

2003
01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:46.850
the kind of shit that you're into.

2004
01:52:46.851 --> 01:52:49.700
Like I was getting tattooed the other day and while I was getting tattooed the

2005
01:52:49.701 --> 01:52:50.930
fucking guy on the,

2006
01:52:50.931 --> 01:52:54.560
the next booth was listening to this one of those metal songs like

2007
01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:57.410
that,

2008
01:52:57.410 --> 01:53:02.410
that annoying fucking screaming angry metal that sounds exactly the same.

2009
01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:05.360
That just reflects where your fucking head is.

2010
01:53:05.361 --> 01:53:09.710
That no one who's like at peace and he's like in a good place in our life,

2011
01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.780
listens to that shit.
You know?

2012
01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:16.370
And no one who's got their shit together would think the Carlson see.
It's funny.

2013
01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:19.550
You know,
you'd have to,
you have to be a mess.
You have to be,

2014
01:53:19.551 --> 01:53:21.710
there has to be something wrong with the way your mind works.

2015
01:53:21.711 --> 01:53:25.400
It has to work really poorly.
It has to be really low watt.

2016
01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:29.870
But there's a lot of really low want people out there.
Man.
I like the little one.

2017
01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:31.760
That's fun.
That's what's interesting when you,
you know,

2018
01:53:31.761 --> 01:53:34.940
when you see like certain things that certain people are in to certain books

2019
01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:36.980
that people are into and,
and you're like,
God damn,

2020
01:53:36.981 --> 01:53:40.070
really certain TV shows all that.
Fuck Devi.
She was awesome.

2021
01:53:40.610 --> 01:53:44.420
And you're like really?
Like,
okay.
I guess it is for you.
You know?

2022
01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:47.600
That's a hard thing to accept that I guess it is for you.
You know,

2023
01:53:47.601 --> 01:53:50.570
especially as a comic,
don't you find yourself like angry?
Like no,

2024
01:53:50.571 --> 01:53:54.500
it fucking sucks.
Like you almost want to,
I want to argue the opinion,
you know,

2025
01:53:54.501 --> 01:53:57.230
but it doesn't suck for them.
You're like fucking twilight,

2026
01:53:57.470 --> 01:54:00.920
a billion screaming horny chicks can't be wrong.
You know,

2027
01:54:00.921 --> 01:54:03.740
you can think it sucks all day,
but they love that stupid fucking movie.

2028
01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:08.210
<v 1>Look at cars to one of the worst Pixar movies ever was cars in my opinion.</v>

2029
01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:11.120
And they're doing a sequel to it just because they know how many people like

2030
01:54:11.121 --> 01:54:13.520
Nascar,
how many mid American people,

2031
01:54:13.670 --> 01:54:16.280
how much merchandise they can sell it based on that movie?

2032
01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:20.830
<v 7>No.
Nascar's a number one spectator sport in the country.
Yeah.
How crazy is that?</v>

2033
01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:23.420
They're watching cars go around and show.
Yeah.

2034
01:54:23.421 --> 01:54:26.260
So you can sit there all day and go,
that's the dumbest sport ever,

2035
01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:30.820
or whatever it is in that or go wow.
Or there's a lot of people that are into it.

2036
01:54:30.821 --> 01:54:33.070
I'm just not.
How often do you go,
uh,

2037
01:54:33.071 --> 01:54:36.190
on the road and you're in the south and they bring up Nascar?

2038
01:54:36.610 --> 01:54:40.450
Like when you do morning radio,
you ever had that happen?
Yeah.
Fucking nuts.

2039
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:44.460
They start talking about drivers and where the guys' shows this better jackets.

2040
01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:47.660
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
They all got my fucking Darrell.
Darrell Waltrip.
Yeah,
I get there.

2041
01:54:47.670 --> 01:54:50.440
Like who the hell is that guy?
Meanwhile they all know who he is.

2042
01:54:50.441 --> 01:54:52.140
That guy is a superstar down there.
Yeah.

2043
01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:55.390
It's like there's a whole different world in the south that people are not aware

2044
01:54:55.391 --> 01:54:58.330
of like music wise,
like country music.

2045
01:54:58.450 --> 01:55:03.370
There's fucking smash hit country music songs that you will never hear you.

2046
01:55:03.371 --> 01:55:06.280
We'll go through your entire life when you will never hear them.
Meanwhile,

2047
01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:10.840
they are loved by 50,
60 million people in this country.
They're not an,

2048
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:12.010
it's an India.

2049
01:55:12.190 --> 01:55:15.730
It's not fucking foreign music from Bangladesh or Brazil or something like that.

2050
01:55:15.731 --> 01:55:16.120
No,

2051
01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.770
this shit is going on in Alabama and Kentucky and Mississippi and they fucking

2052
01:55:20.771 --> 01:55:22.890
love that music.
Brian,

2053
01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:26.890
remember that time we went to that place in North Carolina and what did that bar

2054
01:55:26.891 --> 01:55:31.570
next door?
We're in Raleigh,
North Carolina.
We were at that,
um,

2055
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:32.051
Charlie.

2056
01:55:32.051 --> 01:55:35.650
Good nights and right next door there's a bar and the bar was playing country

2057
01:55:35.651 --> 01:55:40.140
music.
They were all singing along with a whole rider.
Yeah,
there's a,
they had a,

2058
01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:42.460
you know,
it's a funny by nickel bowl,
but that club,

2059
01:55:42.490 --> 01:55:44.190
that bar has an identity problem

2060
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:47.340
<v 0>because I have went in there and it would play country music and then it would</v>

2061
01:55:47.341 --> 01:55:51.990
go from country music to rap to Jay z and then the equal amount of people would

2062
01:55:51.991 --> 01:55:53.490
like start dancing.
You're like,
you know what?

2063
01:55:53.491 --> 01:55:56.120
That's for into two really different things.

2064
01:55:56.190 --> 01:55:59.790
That's for the girls that like to fuck black guys.
You gotta mix it up.
Yeah.

2065
01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:00.661
I mean it was weird.

2066
01:56:00.661 --> 01:56:03.560
You're there and you get a lot of that in the soul and then you hear a lot of

2067
01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.440
like she,
you know?
Yeah,

2068
01:56:05.870 --> 01:56:08.670
well you got to bring the black guys in because a lot of girls like to fuck

2069
01:56:08.671 --> 01:56:11.670
black guys and the black guys was just not going to tolerate that country music

2070
01:56:11.671 --> 01:56:15.480
all day.
If you want to,
you want to bring in those little chubby white girls.

2071
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:19.260
You've got to bring in some rap music for them to track some black guys to make

2072
01:56:19.261 --> 01:56:20.190
the mix more interesting.

2073
01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:23.430
I remember I was at at that particular place when I was there and I went to

2074
01:56:23.431 --> 01:56:28.431
shake the door guys hand and we kinda did the Roman shake by just how our hands,

2075
01:56:28.441 --> 01:56:32.580
you know where you grabbed the thing.
I'll never forget this shoot.

2076
01:56:32.610 --> 01:56:35.880
I don't know if it was a cast or a plastic thing that went from his wrist

2077
01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:39.930
probably down in the here.
And he had them on both sides for fighting.

2078
01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:44.340
So you couldn't tell him a shirt on the door guy.

2079
01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:47.450
So this was all like cash.
So if he,
yeah,

2080
01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:50.720
if he got in a fight with somebody really had an extra yeah cause I go,

2081
01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:52.530
did you break her arm?
He goes,
no,
I got him on both sides.

2082
01:56:52.531 --> 01:56:54.600
It's for if shit goes down and it was so,

2083
01:56:54.630 --> 01:56:57.090
seems like the gladiators were from here to here,
you know,

2084
01:56:57.210 --> 01:57:01.110
like a codpiece where does that forearm protection,
yeah.
Yeah,

2085
01:57:01.111 --> 01:57:04.960
to forums on a very sensitive area.
It's weird thing.
You want to protect the,

2086
01:57:04.961 --> 01:57:08.340
maybe he's a wing Chung man.
Yeah,
I think that's right.

2087
01:57:08.490 --> 01:57:11.700
That's why he didn't have that.
You'd think that you were blocking,

2088
01:57:12.150 --> 01:57:15.600
I guess that's the shit.
I hope that somebody fucking shoots.

2089
01:57:15.601 --> 01:57:19.510
You saw that some roadhouse stuff?
Yeah.
Well that place was like roadhouse,
man.

2090
01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:22.570
We were right next door.
That place there,
they had a,
uh,
the,

2091
01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:26.070
remember that one girl that was super awesome at Rodan,
that mechanical bull.

2092
01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:30.300
Like how many cowboy decks is that chick sucked.
Thousand.

2093
01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:33.500
Really good.
Yeah,
I've done it before.
It's hard.

2094
01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:37.050
I have video of you doing it on tls.
MTV,
Tlc.

2095
01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:42.060
No TRL.
Never done it.
Yeah,
it's a,
it's not easy.

2096
01:57:42.300 --> 01:57:45.730
It's hard.
It's hard to hang on to that thing.
So stupid.

2097
01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:49.650
It's a fucking dumb way to get hurt riding bulls.
A dumb way to get hurt.

2098
01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:53.720
But riding a bull that's a fake bowl.
That's even fucking stupid.
Or you know,

2099
01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:54.601
it's like,

2100
01:57:54.601 --> 01:57:57.690
cause they could easily make a fig Bullock could fucking throw you off and kill

2101
01:57:57.691 --> 01:58:02.100
you.
So it's like,
you know,
they just make a fig bold,
just strong enough.

2102
01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:04.740
Just kind of hang on for a little.

2103
01:58:05.610 --> 01:58:10.200
That was the scariest thing that we ever did on fear factor was we have people

2104
01:58:10.201 --> 01:58:14.670
ride bulls.
That was the one time where I was like,
what the fuck are we doing?

2105
01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:18.330
There was the one time where I literally did not want to do the stunt and all we

2106
01:58:18.331 --> 01:58:22.050
did was like,
we just rolled the dice.
We said,
okay,
let's,
let's,

2107
01:58:22.110 --> 01:58:23.520
let's hope we don't crap out here.

2108
01:58:23.550 --> 01:58:26.460
Let's hope we don't fuck up and somebody doesn't want to get paralyzed.

2109
01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:30.900
We took these people that had never written bowls in their life and we threw

2110
01:58:30.901 --> 01:58:35.901
them on these giant fucking murderous rampaging beasts and we just throw them on

2111
01:58:37.231 --> 01:58:40.290
there and the guy was like,
don't worry,
these are training bowls,
and I was like,

2112
01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:42.820
what the fuck are you talking about?
That's a bull that bull does know.

2113
01:58:42.821 --> 01:58:44.910
He's a training bull.
He does no idea.

2114
01:58:44.911 --> 01:58:48.730
He's a training Bullock the that thinking like,
oh,

2115
01:58:48.731 --> 01:58:50.900
these are the bulls they train the Rodeo guys on.

2116
01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:53.920
They're not as aggressive like the fuck are you talking about?

2117
01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:55.570
They're looking at the cage,

2118
01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:59.500
this things in the cage and it's fucking bouncing back and forth and slamming

2119
01:58:59.501 --> 01:59:03.640
into the bars.
We took this girl on,
she weighed 90 pounds,
like no bullshit.

2120
01:59:03.641 --> 01:59:07.780
She was tiny the most,
she weighed like 98 okay.

2121
01:59:07.930 --> 01:59:10.870
She's like five feet tall.
She's a tiny little girl.

2122
01:59:10.990 --> 01:59:15.990
She gets on this bull and the think box and she goes full lying.

2123
01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:21.240
I mean instantly goes flying and as she's flying the book kicks adder and the

2124
01:59:21.431 --> 01:59:25.570
Bulls Hook just misses her face,
like just misses her face.

2125
01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:30.160
It would have caved her fucking monkey head in like no question about it.

2126
01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:32.980
This poor little girl,
she fell and landed on her back.

2127
01:59:32.981 --> 01:59:35.950
She got knocked out and you know,
she came,
she was,

2128
01:59:35.951 --> 01:59:38.590
she was conscious but she was like out of breath and she couldn't,
you know,

2129
01:59:38.591 --> 01:59:42.550
the breath got knocked out of her and she was all like,
Ugh,
oh I'm okay.
I'm okay.

2130
01:59:42.551 --> 01:59:45.160
And they had to like take care of her and there the,
the,
the,
the,

2131
01:59:45.170 --> 01:59:48.340
the paramedics had to check her out and make sure she was fine and she just

2132
01:59:48.341 --> 01:59:53.320
lucky that she was fine.
Just plain fucking lucky.
Those I got to see those bulls.

2133
01:59:53.321 --> 01:59:54.980
My wife was on a show right years ago

2134
01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:59.030
<v 2>that nobody saw called America's toughest job in what they did is every week</v>

2135
01:59:59.031 --> 01:59:59.900
they did something else.

2136
01:59:59.901 --> 02:00:03.230
So she was on the deadliest catch boat and had to do that stuff.

2137
02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:07.430
And then she was a,
um,
an oil rigger and had to go do that stuff.

2138
02:00:07.431 --> 02:00:10.390
Then the log stuff.
And she had a thing where one of the episode,

2139
02:00:10.391 --> 02:00:13.800
she was a bull fighter,
so she was the clown that got in,

2140
02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:18.050
in an actual Rodeo is the thing.
And so when the bull buck,
the guy,

2141
02:00:18.170 --> 02:00:21.110
she would have to run up and it was,
these weren't fake polls.

2142
02:00:21.111 --> 02:00:26.060
It wasn't like for things she had to run up and literally smack the ball to get

2143
02:00:26.061 --> 02:00:29.540
the bull to chase her cause she was getting on the show was getting graded on

2144
02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:32.420
how well she made the cowboy safe.

2145
02:00:32.660 --> 02:00:36.500
And she blew out her knee twist and turn and it's like a lot of dirt.

2146
02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:41.210
It was pretty scary.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.
Just to be on TV.
Yeah.
And she did it,

2147
02:00:41.211 --> 02:00:44.750
you know.
Should she make money off that show?
No,
but she did some cool stuff.

2148
02:00:44.751 --> 02:00:47.020
She got to drive the grave digger and some over cars.

2149
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:51.290
She blew her fucking knee out for free.
Yeah.
So I mean she,
you know.

2150
02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:54.320
Wow.
She didn't make I,
like I said,
it was pretty good.

2151
02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:57.650
It's one of those shows she had to do that fishing thing though.

2152
02:00:57.651 --> 02:00:59.180
That just looks shitty.

2153
02:01:00.330 --> 02:01:04.050
<v 0>Yes,
she did.
She got a truck driving license and drove the ice road.</v>

2154
02:01:04.370 --> 02:01:08.500
Scary as fuck.
She had a really good at all that.
She didn't make any money.
Hmm.

2155
02:01:08.730 --> 02:01:12.720
Oh Man.
There's got to be on t v eight a reality show money every month.

2156
02:01:12.721 --> 02:01:16.950
I think she,
I think she got a stipend every week.
500 bucks.
Cash was nuts.

2157
02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:18.660
It is nuts and do that to you.

2158
02:01:18.990 --> 02:01:21.600
They getting use you like that on television over a course of like,

2159
02:01:21.601 --> 02:01:24.030
this ain't like fear factor where you're only on it for a couple of days now.

2160
02:01:24.031 --> 02:01:27.390
She was on it for how long she was gone for two months.
Cheese.

2161
02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:31.770
She did like nine episodes.
So one episode a week probably.
Dude.
What up?

2162
02:01:31.771 --> 02:01:35.040
She got killed by a bull.
Oh,
you should see all the stuff that he,
yeah,

2163
02:01:35.610 --> 02:01:40.420
she got killed.
How would you have felt?
Yeah,
right.
Yeah.
You can't even sue.

2164
02:01:40.730 --> 02:01:43.100
<v 7>You can't even do anything about it.
Dude.</v>

2165
02:01:43.130 --> 02:01:47.030
Bowls scare the fuck out of me when I see that running with the Bulls in Spain,

2166
02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:48.890
you know,
there was a show once where they,
uh,

2167
02:01:48.891 --> 02:01:52.230
they wanted me to go running with the bulls.
I forget what it was,
but uh,
they,

2168
02:01:52.290 --> 02:01:54.830
there was like one of the things they wanted me to do on the show and I was
like,

2169
02:01:54.831 --> 02:01:55.910
what are you talking about?
And they're like,

2170
02:01:56.100 --> 02:01:57.530
the people run with the Bulls all the time.

2171
02:01:57.531 --> 02:01:59.000
He just gotta make sure you get ahead.
I'm like,

2172
02:01:59.001 --> 02:02:02.870
those are his and beer soaked fucking streets.
People are tripping.

2173
02:02:02.871 --> 02:02:05.510
Have you ever watched videos?
Fuck you.
I was like,

2174
02:02:05.511 --> 02:02:08.810
you want me to go run with the Bulls?
Like what's an ancient tradition?

2175
02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:11.600
It's one of the dumbest ancient traditions ever.

2176
02:02:11.601 --> 02:02:14.570
The fact that people still do that today is one of the most,

2177
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:17.510
one of the weirdest fucking statements about human beings.

2178
02:02:17.550 --> 02:02:21.070
You take a bunch of rampaging,
monstrous beast animals.
They,

2179
02:02:21.071 --> 02:02:23.150
have you ever seen the videos to dudes getting jacked?

2180
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:25.850
They just get thrown through the air.
Like they're nothing.

2181
02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:30.320
Like these things are so fucking strong.
And they stopped them and Gorham,
I mean,

2182
02:02:30.321 --> 02:02:33.650
people get fucked up.
They get really,

2183
02:02:33.651 --> 02:02:37.580
really fucked up by these things.
Man.
The fact that people are still doing that,

2184
02:02:37.581 --> 02:02:41.590
man.
You see the video,
the a matador last week,
they've got the,
um,

2185
02:02:41.630 --> 02:02:46.510
the horn through his face,
through his mouth,
and uh,
through his,

2186
02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:49.670
at the bottom of his chin and now through his mouth is fucking horn is poking

2187
02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:53.480
out of his mouth.
That's the image.
So I saw that and I said,
well,

2188
02:02:53.481 --> 02:02:55.400
I seen one before that was more fucked up.

2189
02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:58.940
There was one that were a guy's getting it through the stomach and the bulls

2190
02:02:58.941 --> 02:03:01.610
like lifting them through the air.
It's like just lower abdomen,

2191
02:03:01.611 --> 02:03:05.390
like right above his dick.
It's the most,
because of the look of pain on his face.

2192
02:03:05.391 --> 02:03:08.690
He just,
he knows he's fucked.
I mean,
he's just done.

2193
02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:11.150
And so I started looking at Google search,

2194
02:03:11.151 --> 02:03:15.170
trying to find that image and I found so many fucking images,

2195
02:03:15.171 --> 02:03:19.280
guy him dudes,
most of it's the running with the bulls though.

2196
02:03:19.281 --> 02:03:21.350
Most of the images came from running of the Bulls.

2197
02:03:21.351 --> 02:03:26.330
So many guys getting fucked up by animals.
Brian,
you went to the La Zoo,
Huh?

2198
02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:30.740
<v 1>Uh,
yeah man,
that was the worst zoo I've ever been to.</v>

2199
02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:36.100
And one of the just fucking creepiest as there was so many cages that look like

2200
02:03:36.741 --> 02:03:40.430
the animal died and they just never bought a new animal to put in there.

2201
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:42.170
So it's just like,
like empty.

2202
02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:44.540
And you're sitting in there trying to find the simple animal and you're like,

2203
02:03:44.541 --> 02:03:48.070
wait a second,
this is the cage has not even been touched for five years.
Like,

2204
02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:52.750
and then,
uh,
there's just,
I didn't see one lion.
I didn't see an elephant.
Uh,

2205
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:54.910
no,
no.
I just went there.

2206
02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:58.070
I was sober and I went through the whole thing and like two hours.

2207
02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:01.880
It was like so fast.
It was the worst zoo ever.
The only cool thing was,

2208
02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:04.360
<v 7>it's not as bad as the one I told you about in Massachusetts.</v>

2209
02:04:04.361 --> 02:04:07.360
There was one that they shut down.
There was,
it was horrible.
They had this,

2210
02:04:07.361 --> 02:04:10.810
this little tiny ass cage for this lion and the lion would just walk around in

2211
02:04:10.811 --> 02:04:13.630
circles,
looking depressed,
walk around in circles.

2212
02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:17.880
<v 1>The coolest part was when they fed the chimpanzees and there's like six of them</v>

2213
02:04:17.881 --> 02:04:20.430
and they are just all lined up,
you know,
sitting next to each other,

2214
02:04:20.431 --> 02:04:23.660
itching their butts,
you know,
and they're all eating.
They all grabbed,
uh,

2215
02:04:23.730 --> 02:04:24.151
what is that?

2216
02:04:24.151 --> 02:04:27.390
Cucumbers and they're all just had like four cucumbers and one was like acting

2217
02:04:27.391 --> 02:04:28.820
like he was smoking.
Oh,
hey look,

2218
02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:32.100
it was just hilarious because there were just like humans and they're all just,

2219
02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:34.590
but within there,
like not sitting like on,

2220
02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:38.250
it was called the chimpanzee pin house or the eight pent house

2221
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:41.190
<v 6>and it's like they were just sitting like on stairwells.</v>

2222
02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:44.640
So there's just all these monkeys sitting on stairwells eating cucumbers and it

2223
02:04:44.641 --> 02:04:47.970
was just the oddest thing ever.
That zoo is fucking weird.

2224
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.990
It's very strange that we feel like it's okay for us to take intelligent
animals.

2225
02:04:51.991 --> 02:04:55.290
Just lock them up so we could stare at that.
I that I don't agree with that.

2226
02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:58.230
I mean that,
that zoo,
I agree with you on that.
Cause that zoo,

2227
02:04:58.231 --> 02:05:02.250
I don't agree with that.
Zoo z should be torn down.
Uh,
I was,

2228
02:05:02.490 --> 02:05:07.490
I'm used to Columbus Zoo where a monkey has like acres and acres and acres of

2229
02:05:07.531 --> 02:05:11.500
just grass and San Diego's great shit like that.
Yeah.

2230
02:05:11.550 --> 02:05:14.280
That's one of my favorite zoos in the cuts.
A huge ass.
Do you know,

2231
02:05:14.281 --> 02:05:17.370
they have a lot of space to roam around,
but la zoo,
we'll get you,

2232
02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:20.880
they'll get you off zoos.
They see on the chips.
Should be illegal man.

2233
02:05:21.050 --> 02:05:24.410
<v 0>I was in Colorado at the zoo and this fucking champ was screaming,</v>

2234
02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:26.370
screaming in agony.
Wasn't chimp,

2235
02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:30.530
was a monkey who was in his cage and screaming in agony and you could hear it in

2236
02:05:30.531 --> 02:05:32.510
his voice.
He was fucking tortured.

2237
02:05:32.690 --> 02:05:36.470
He was stuck in this little box by himself and people would just walk by staring

2238
02:05:36.471 --> 02:05:39.200
at him and he was just losing his mind,
just screaming.

2239
02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:41.780
It was such a tortured sound.
I mean,

2240
02:05:42.130 --> 02:05:46.250
are we really getting that much out of these fucking guys being locked in this

2241
02:05:46.251 --> 02:05:48.530
thing that it's okay to do this,
but you got pictures.

2242
02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:50.270
<v 6>Oh Dude,
there's this one eight that was,</v>

2243
02:05:50.271 --> 02:05:53.800
there was like a red a and he looks so sad.
Yeah.
Yes.

2244
02:05:53.810 --> 02:05:58.730
An orangutan rang a Tang and he was so sad.
His eyes are just like so depressed.

2245
02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:00.500
But then his son came up to me,

2246
02:06:00.501 --> 02:06:04.040
why was filming and just start slamming the window,
like,

2247
02:06:04.041 --> 02:06:08.510
don't record my dad.
Well,
there's one who's staring out of,
yeah,

2248
02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:10.760
<v 0>that's got to suck,
man.
They're intelligent.
I mean,</v>

2249
02:06:10.761 --> 02:06:14.240
they're not nearly as intelligence people,
but is it okay to lockup retards?

2250
02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:16.010
You know what I mean?
At what point in time,

2251
02:06:16.011 --> 02:06:19.550
if we could prove that a monkey was as smart as a a down syndrome person,

2252
02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:23.420
would it be okay to put the down syndrome person in jail next to the monkey?

2253
02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:25.100
You know,
I mean how,

2254
02:06:25.101 --> 02:06:28.850
how intelligent they have to be to where we can't lock them up,
you know.

2255
02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:32.360
So I said if we ever found big foot and everybody thinks big foots all cool and

2256
02:06:32.361 --> 02:06:34.640
everything and you know,
he watched it on monster quest.
Wow.

2257
02:06:34.641 --> 02:06:36.290
I wonder if it's real.
If it was real,

2258
02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:39.950
he'd be locked up right next to that fucking Orangutang.
You know,
we wouldn't,

2259
02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:43.970
as long as we can't understand your language,
fuck you get in the cage.

2260
02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:48.900
<v 6>Vivid would have a porn video with the big thing.
So,
and Kendra,
Kendra,
Brittany,</v>

2261
02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:52.340
sky,
Britney,
Scott,
your video.
But you know what I'm,

2262
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:55.080
my girlfriend was telling me about that Kendra video.
You've heard of it,
right?

2263
02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:59.730
What?
Kendra?
Yeah,
there's a sex tape that came out before Hefner.

2264
02:07:00.150 --> 02:07:05.150
Hefner dated her when she was 18 so it must have happened like the first two

2265
02:07:05.851 --> 02:07:09.630
months is with the w e c fighter.

2266
02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:12.770
How do you know that he wasn't banging her while she was with halftime?
Right.

2267
02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:14.770
Seems more like,
yeah,
but suppose there's

2268
02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:17.600
<v 0>those girls.
Don't all fuck them exclusively.
That's ridiculous.</v>

2269
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:19.790
It's supposedly this failure was before Hefner though.

2270
02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:22.940
The whole fucking Hafter thing,
man.
Poor fucking girls.

2271
02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:27.400
Those poor sad girls that fuck that guy to try to get famous.
They had to be,

2272
02:07:27.530 --> 02:07:32.480
they couldn't leave the mansion after 90 9:00 PM that's hilarious that he would

2273
02:07:32.481 --> 02:07:34.400
still try to keep them from getting fucked by other guys.

2274
02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:36.130
He had know it was going down.

2275
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:40.180
<v 6>Do you follow him on Twitter?
No.
Wow.
It's so sad.
Is it?</v>

2276
02:07:40.210 --> 02:07:44.540
He just his uh,
Hugh Hefner's Twitter is,
every day is just like,

2277
02:07:44.650 --> 02:07:48.820
it's just rewatched.
Oh yeah.
It's totally him.
Just rewatch.
Gone with the wind.

2278
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:53.700
I love that movie.
Just rewatch Tutsi.
Oh,
those crazy guys.
Every that's,

2279
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:55.480
he just watches old movies all day.

2280
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:58.720
That's all he does when he's a hundred years old,
bro.
How old is he?

2281
02:07:58.990 --> 02:08:00.930
He's deep in his eighties right?
Yeah.

2282
02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:04.870
Late eighties it's amazing that he's still got to keep that thing going.

2283
02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:05.330
You know?

2284
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:09.430
He's got to still try to keep that at the end of that fascinating fucking

2285
02:08:10.090 --> 02:08:12.340
lifestyle.
What point do you just go,
you know what,

2286
02:08:12.341 --> 02:08:14.160
everyone just get out of the mansion please.

2287
02:08:14.650 --> 02:08:19.090
I want to hang around and be bold.
You stopped doing that though.

2288
02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:22.900
You started dying.
Yeah.
You know,
keep the business going.
Right.

2289
02:08:23.170 --> 02:08:25.210
I just went to an estate sale the other day.

2290
02:08:25.450 --> 02:08:28.810
Somebody died down the street and estate sales where they just kind of opened up

2291
02:08:28.811 --> 02:08:31.690
their house and you just buy anything you want.
Like everything's for sale,

2292
02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:32.081
you know,

2293
02:08:32.081 --> 02:08:35.050
get the fuck out all the shit out of the house and just walk in and say,

2294
02:08:35.051 --> 02:08:37.140
I'll give you 50 bucks for that.
Right,
right,
right.

2295
02:08:37.150 --> 02:08:41.920
And it's so crazy because they just like the guy died and he did not touch

2296
02:08:41.921 --> 02:08:45.790
anything.
So it's like how the guy died.
That's how it was house look like.

2297
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.140
And it's just so crazy just seeing how this person lived.
You know?
Like,

2298
02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:52.690
like how dirty this person was.

2299
02:08:52.691 --> 02:08:56.260
And just like how creepy it,
what was it like?

2300
02:08:56.580 --> 02:08:59.970
I guess it would be,
it's really hard to explain like,
like as an example,

2301
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:01.840
like his chair,
the side of his chair,

2302
02:09:01.841 --> 02:09:06.580
it was just like stacks of like TV guides from the last 40 years maybe.
You know.

2303
02:09:06.581 --> 02:09:11.581
And they all had like crossword puzzles to motherfuckers out there like we were

2304
02:09:11.651 --> 02:09:13.060
talking about that Michael Rupert Guy.

2305
02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:15.730
Imagine if he can be a fly on the wall in his house.

2306
02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:19.840
Him hanging out with his dog.
By the way,
one of my favorite quotes from that was,

2307
02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:21.790
uh,
that is when he goes,
I need,

2308
02:09:22.030 --> 02:09:25.610
I take my dog out to go walking every day and a half a smile closer.

2309
02:09:27.770 --> 02:09:29.470
That was going to bring that up,
dude.

2310
02:09:29.471 --> 02:09:31.930
The fucking world is ending according to you.
You asshole.

2311
02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:36.430
You're out there collecting smiles.
Yeah,
he sees how much know he can make smile.

2312
02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:38.680
Who he looked like.
Remember on office space,

2313
02:09:38.710 --> 02:09:41.620
that guy that made the jump to conclusions floor mat.

2314
02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:45.160
He looks exactly like that guy.
Jump to conclusions.
Floormate.

2315
02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:48.790
So Google search jumped to conclusions,
floor mat,
office space,

2316
02:09:48.791 --> 02:09:53.530
and look at the photo.
And then Google route,
whatever the guy's name is Rupert,

2317
02:09:54.420 --> 02:09:58.240
same guy.
This guy said it was the Corey Feldman sale.
Corey Feldman.
Still Alive,

2318
02:09:58.250 --> 02:10:02.890
sir.
Done the handsome Corey.
Poor little fella.
Yeah.

2319
02:10:03.010 --> 02:10:06.010
So another one,
childhood stars.
Just like your girl Lindsay.

2320
02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:11.140
It's so fucking speaking.
Impossible grind man being famous as a trial.

2321
02:10:11.230 --> 02:10:13.420
And then what happens,
you know,
with the Disney channel,

2322
02:10:13.421 --> 02:10:18.310
now look all the future of those guys that,
that channel's cranking out.
Yeah.

2323
02:10:18.311 --> 02:10:22.710
No Shit.
It's a puppy mill for future Danny Bonaduce.

2324
02:10:22.990 --> 02:10:25.990
That's a great way to put it into a puppy mill.
It really is a puppy mill.

2325
02:10:25.991 --> 02:10:28.780
You're dead right?
You all live in this to look a lake Renee.

2326
02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:32.380
I think they've supposed to live there.
Really?
Yeah.
Cause it's right near Disney.

2327
02:10:32.410 --> 02:10:34.130
It's right next to him.
The Disney.
And they all

2328
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:37.250
<v 0>live in Toluca lake,
the Jonas brothers.
Uh,
what any of them,</v>

2329
02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:38.360
I don't even know any of them.

2330
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:40.940
So we got it down to a science over there at Disney and they know how to make

2331
02:10:40.941 --> 02:10:42.110
fucking stars.
Yeah.

2332
02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:45.890
They take a chick who could sing and they just fucking make them dance as your

2333
02:10:45.891 --> 02:10:46.551
sitcoms.

2334
02:10:46.551 --> 02:10:51.410
They can wear promise rate and those sickos mostly we have a sister who bid ass.

2335
02:10:51.411 --> 02:10:51.890
Fuck.

2336
02:10:51.890 --> 02:10:55.190
Did you see the video of Miley Cyrus given some 40 year old guy a lap dance,

2337
02:10:55.470 --> 02:10:58.370
but she was like 16 and her dad's like,
Hey,

2338
02:10:58.371 --> 02:11:02.850
your kid's going to be willing to Gainesville be you fucking don't Burke,

2339
02:11:03.090 --> 02:11:07.790
my fucking dad,
Billy Ray Cyrus.
You know God.
If that was my daughter,

2340
02:11:07.791 --> 02:11:10.880
I'd be horrified.
I would be sick to my stomach.
16 years old,

2341
02:11:10.881 --> 02:11:14.510
given a 40 year old guy,
a lap dance.
He doesn't give a fuck.

2342
02:11:14.510 --> 02:11:18.600
You got a second chance at stardom by him driving around in a Ferrari for

2343
02:11:18.630 --> 02:11:21.080
probably he used up all that Achy breaky heart money.

2344
02:11:21.081 --> 02:11:24.710
But this fucking Miley Cyrus money,
the Hannah Montana money ain't going nowhere,

2345
02:11:24.711 --> 02:11:29.120
son.
That shit will take him to the grave.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2346
02:11:29.121 --> 02:11:33.650
five 41 that means a,
we've been doing this over an hour and a half,
two hours.

2347
02:11:33.730 --> 02:11:38.090
It's two hours.
20 minutes or 15 minutes.
That's too much.
That's too much.

2348
02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:41.720
I'm sorry.
We had a run out in the beginning and grabbed the microphones,

2349
02:11:41.721 --> 02:11:46.160
but I know that shit sounds much better with the microphones on,
correct?
Oh,

2350
02:11:46.161 --> 02:11:50.180
totally.
Yeah,
so glad you enjoy it,
John.
Half.
Ron,
what do you got going on?

2351
02:11:50.181 --> 02:11:51.740
You want to plug?
All right,
nothing going on,

2352
02:11:51.741 --> 02:11:54.170
but people go to John heffron.com they have all my dates.

2353
02:11:54.171 --> 02:11:58.550
They have problem with two F's,
two F's.
John with an h.
Dot.
J O,

2354
02:11:58.551 --> 02:12:01.760
h n h e f,
F r o n.com.

2355
02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:06.380
The bottom winner of last comic standing.
Oh yeah,
add is Twitter.

2356
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:09.410
It's right there on the little screen there,
but if you're on iTunes,

2357
02:12:09.411 --> 02:12:10.670
you don't know what the fuck we're talking about.

2358
02:12:10.671 --> 02:12:13.340
If you're one of those strictly audio only fellows,

2359
02:12:13.630 --> 02:12:17.390
then if you're an iTunes and type in John Heprin and search and look it on mine

2360
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:20.780
and you're missing what the beauty of the experience of the Ustream podcast

2361
02:12:20.810 --> 02:12:22.970
because the eastern podcast has facial features,

2362
02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:29.090
costumes and see when someone's checking their phone or on my girlfriend on a

2363
02:12:29.091 --> 02:12:34.040
paper to Kona fanning.
Anyone else knew it?
What the fuck are you talking about?

2364
02:12:34.910 --> 02:12:39.380
What's wrong with you?
Boy?
So sad man.
Um,
uh,

2365
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:42.050
thanks for tuning in.
We'll be back next week,
same time.

2366
02:12:42.051 --> 02:12:44.050
We've got the sound down now.
And uh,

2367
02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:47.120
now that I finally got the last microphone in today and that's why we had to

2368
02:12:47.121 --> 02:12:51.050
take off at the beginning.
I thought I had a third one,
but I didn't have the,
uh,

2369
02:12:51.710 --> 02:12:54.140
the microphone cord.
So now it's all set up.

2370
02:12:54.141 --> 02:12:56.560
We're still trying to figure out what the fuck to do behind us.
Uh,

2371
02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:00.140
the green screen setup is not as easy as I thought because not only do I have to

2372
02:13:00.141 --> 02:13:02.900
get a tri caster,
but I also have to get fucking lighting in here.

2373
02:13:03.590 --> 02:13:08.590
It's not a banner like just to cool your alien e d three d Samsung.

2374
02:13:09.051 --> 02:13:12.950
No,
no,
three d stupidity.
If I'm going to get a TV,
it'll just be regular TV,

2375
02:13:12.951 --> 02:13:16.540
but that doesn't even make sense because we're talking,
you know,
and it's like,

2376
02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:20.890
cool.
If we did it and we had space behind us,
those TVs,

2377
02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:24.950
I could hook up our computers to it and could just be a huge as monitor TV.

2378
02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:27.800
This stupid computer doesn't even have an htmi out.
You know,

2379
02:13:27.890 --> 02:13:31.610
that's the thing about lap Apple's computers as opposed to like a pcs and,
and,

2380
02:13:31.611 --> 02:13:32.070
and he sees

2381
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:35.880
<v 6>if so many more outputs all you have it display adapter and all you do is get a</v>

2382
02:13:35.881 --> 02:13:38.670
display to htmi adapter on Ebay for $3.

2383
02:13:39.910 --> 02:13:43.300
Well why not the hell they have a fucking outlet built into my goddamn laptop

2384
02:13:43.310 --> 02:13:46.890
sun because it's a smaller uh,
output.
So it's,

2385
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:51.300
I mean it isn't there a video out?
It does with what video out?
It's on the side.

2386
02:13:51.301 --> 02:13:54.210
It's a mini display adapter.
Oh,
that thing.
And you just get a,

2387
02:13:54.211 --> 02:13:58.140
a mini display adapter to htmi.
So we would do that and put it behind us.

2388
02:13:58.141 --> 02:14:00.900
Then what will we put on it?
We just have it as a second monitor behind it.

2389
02:14:00.901 --> 02:14:03.100
So you have that,
you want to show a video,
you just drag it to the mill.

2390
02:14:03.101 --> 02:14:05.400
I guess we should,
when we should be talking.

2391
02:14:05.401 --> 02:14:09.500
We should have just nothing but car accidents.
Totally know.

2392
02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:13.500
I kids will have episodes like this week it's going to be,

2393
02:14:13.590 --> 02:14:15.390
the problem with the green screen is we can have video,

2394
02:14:15.391 --> 02:14:17.820
we have images and that's not as cool.
You could do video,

2395
02:14:17.821 --> 02:14:20.010
you can do anything you want to behind this is that the green screen is just

2396
02:14:20.011 --> 02:14:23.970
like old technology.
Why not have a huge L LSD?
D's Are so cheap nowadays.

2397
02:14:23.971 --> 02:14:26.870
It's just have a crazy big LCD.
That'd be a hundred times better.
No,

2398
02:14:26.910 --> 02:14:29.670
it wouldn't though because if you had a green screen we could have like fucking

2399
02:14:29.671 --> 02:14:31.980
monsters get a green.
If we get a green screen,

2400
02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:35.530
we'll get that stupid clipping where one of us will have like green hair.

2401
02:14:35.550 --> 02:14:38.040
You know?
It just looks shitty.
Does it?
Yeah.

2402
02:14:38.070 --> 02:14:40.460
Do you think it makes treated John Green screen technologies?
Not yet.

2403
02:14:40.670 --> 02:14:42.200
<v 0>John [inaudible] good,</v>

2404
02:14:42.810 --> 02:14:45.420
good stuff with the Green Tree Inn and then you could plug clipping apparently

2405
02:14:45.450 --> 02:14:48.630
from the lighting the,
if you have lighting.
Green screens are pretty tough.

2406
02:14:48.690 --> 02:14:49.150
If you have,

2407
02:14:49.150 --> 02:14:51.950
you have to have power lighting in here so we'd have to flood ourselves.

2408
02:14:52.270 --> 02:14:54.610
<v 6>None of us could wear a green tint of a shirt.</v>

2409
02:14:54.860 --> 02:14:59.170
<v 0>Well today and we'll be fine.
We'd be golden.
Yeah,
we'll figure it out.</v>

2410
02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:03.580
But the sound issue is done.
The video issues done.
We change cameras.
We uh,

2411
02:15:03.610 --> 02:15:06.280
also the host uses Ustream producer thing now.

2412
02:15:06.281 --> 02:15:09.290
So we have the option of having these uh,

2413
02:15:09.370 --> 02:15:12.190
HD cameras broadcast a show.
So,
uh,

2414
02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:14.980
that's the next step is we're going to set up more than one camera cause right

2415
02:15:14.981 --> 02:15:17.780
now we're all in this one couch,
like three monkeys.
But uh,

2416
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:20.110
but I have it set up so that there's another chair over there.

2417
02:15:20.111 --> 02:15:24.640
So I wanted like this Webcam Dro.
No,
keeps on going in and out of focus.

2418
02:15:24.730 --> 02:15:28.180
Right.
It's the autofocus.
I wonder if that's a setting.
I don't think it is.

2419
02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:31.450
Who gives a fuck?
All right.
Ladies and gentlemen sometimes were blurry.

2420
02:15:31.630 --> 02:15:32.590
That's been the show this week.

2421
02:15:33.210 --> 02:15:36.850
It's five 45 and a that's more than two and a half hours.
So,
uh,

2422
02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:40.300
thank you very much for tuning in.
We will be back next week,
same bat time,

2423
02:15:40.301 --> 02:15:45.060
same bat channel,
Tuesday as it were,
or Wednesdays I yelled at my manager and,
um,

2424
02:15:45.370 --> 02:15:47.620
we'll see you motherfuckers.
Thank you very much for tuning in.

2425
02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:51.100
Thanks again for everything.
Thanks for all the constructive criticism.

2426

Thanks for coming to the shows.

See You bitches there.

2430
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:10.210
