3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:07.524
ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.840
what more could they possibly have to say?

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.490
Have they not run out of shit to say,

6
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.143
<v 0>right?</v>

7
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.160
We kind of have a little bit.

8
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.473
Yeah.

9
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.910
<v 1>I feel like I'd have to go out a lot and do stupid shit.</v>

10
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:20.870
Just still have stories,

11
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:23.750
but then I can't tell the stories because then it will get me in trouble.

12
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.231
Yeah.

13
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:24.860
I feel like,

14
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.101
well,

15
00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:26.240
I'm the exact opposite.

16
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.740
I feel like I need to stay home.

17
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:28.574
Read Shit.

18
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.090
You're out there trying to fuck up your life with the super aids.

19
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.010
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by

20
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.780
[inaudible] dot com right now.

21
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:39.690
We're waiting for,

22
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:40.100
uh,

23
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.090
for Rick Ross,

24
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.130
the not rapper Rick Ross,

25
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:44.090
the real Rick Ross.

26
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.141
And,

27
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:45.974
uh,

28
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.461
he's,

29
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:47.120
uh,

30
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.190
I think he's caught up in some core thing.

31
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.560
Is it because of the Rick Ross thing that he's in court?

32
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.520
Because the rapper thing,

33
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.420
some other shit and,

34
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:54.980
uh,

35
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.940
he's on his way over here.

36
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:56.870
So when he gets over here,

37
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.220
we're going to have him on.

38
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.930

I've done this commercial so long,

so many times,

45
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.690
there's no way to do it any differently.

46
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.590
Uh,

49

uh,

50
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.180
I want to call it like a performance company is,

51
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.200
didn't somebody say that?

52
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.901
That's a good,

53
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:24.170
uh,

54
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.003
way to describe it.

55
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.960

56

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.260
Like as far as like performance and physical performance.

72
00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:07.850
This quarter [inaudible] mushroom supplement,

73
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.370
it's called shroom tech sport and it's amazing,

74
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.020
one of the best supplements I've ever used for like energy and for workouts for

75
00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:16.040
intense workouts.

76
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.510

best common combination of cognitive enhancing supplements we could find.

79
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.471

the best pieces of equipment as far as for strength and conditioning.

Equipment you can have.

95
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.560
Keith Weber's,

<v 0>to make our own.</v>

100
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.180
I want to take people through a,

101

Fuck that noise.

104
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.041
But you can do it.

105
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:09.874
You don't have to do it,

106
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.713
but you can do it.

107
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.350
Uh,

108
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.800
but we sell a all sheet different sizes up to,

109
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:16.240
I think we have over a hundred pounds,

110
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:20.590
but the ones I use over between 35 and 70 is this.

111
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.240
It's the people that ordered the over the a hundred pound ones like distract

112
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.551
track.

113
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:25.331
These people are,

114
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:29.440

115
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.810
lieutenant of the Joe Rogan Army.

116
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.380
You've got to keep those people in close proximity.

117
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.390
They're the ones who can do extreme physical things.

118
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.650
You're like a Google of warriors.

119
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.830
That's what you're doing here at on it,

120
00:03:39.831 --> 00:03:40.650
aren't you?

121
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.300
We're trying to put together the strongest human beings possible.

122
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.730
We're trying to help people become a strong as possible.

123
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.150
Look,

124
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.150
having a strong body is fucking awesome if you don't think it is because you've

125
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:53.250
never had a strong body like the,

126
00:03:53.251 --> 00:03:55.930
when someone can give you a jar of mayonnaise and always know that you're going

127
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:59.950
to be the guy that opens up bitch when you have to pick something up and you can

128
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:01.210
because your body can do it.

129
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.700
You can't.

130
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.160
You don't have to call somebody and,

131
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.611
Oh man,

132
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:04.331
I need some help.

133
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:05.141
I'll fuck now.

134
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:07.690
You can just hoist it up yourself cause your body works really good.

135
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.270
I don't know why anybody wouldn't want that.

136
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:10.571
To me,

137
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:14.530
that is a really weird sort of a distinction that people have made where they

138
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:19.531
try to separate intelligence from physical performance and that somehow or

139
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:19.871
another,

140
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:20.201
well,

141
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:22.000
I spend my time being intelligent.

142
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.280
I don't have any time for physical performance,

143
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.761
but yeah,

144
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:27.190
you exist in the same world that I do.

145
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.150
I know this world.

146
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.260
This world is very physical and for you to not enhance your physical body makes

147
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.190
me think you're dumb.

148
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.110
You're dumb in some way.

149
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.560
No.

150
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.951
If your,

151
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:36.371
if your,

152
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:36.851
if your,

153
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:38.830
if your physical body work better,

154
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.290
your life would be enhanced.

155
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.020
But I,

156
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.820
unless your,

157
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.960
your physical parts are just like laying on the couch and podcasting and

158
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:47.794
fucking,

159
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.310
you're a very rare,

160
00:04:52.311 --> 00:04:53.140
I don't need to be,

161
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.030
I don't need to be fit to did though.

162
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.960
If you don't,

163
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:56.980
you think you'd have more energy.

164
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.160
You can fuck those girls better than stick around longer and I spent those boner

165
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:01.150
pills or fourth gone.

166
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.980
You don't need to do anything.

167
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:03.970
Just take one those boner pills,

168
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:04.804
they can't take it.

169
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.760
Do you remember what Tim Ferriss said?

170
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:08.140
That some acid reflex.

171
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.650
Remember what Tim first I though about this no biological free lunch.

172
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.030
Like you're paying for that for to,

173
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.920
for you to get that,

174
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.590
that does crazy super boners from these boner pills.

175
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.740
I got to think that somewhere on the other end of that,

176
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.050
well what it does is it makes all your blood goes to your Dick.

177
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:23.620
Right.

178
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.010
I consider that like,

179
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.411
you know,

180
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:28.210
like helping the flow of blood throughout your body more active.

181
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.840
Well this shit,

182
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.920
you're right actually.

183
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.750
And in fact,

184
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.750
they actually use whatever the fuck the active ingredient in product Fadil or

185
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:40.030
some of the record is in Viagra as a performance enhancing supplement.

186
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:42.390
I believe it's banned now by Olympic committees.

187
00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:43.110
Why?

188
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.980
But because it makes you a [inaudible] has a very similar response to these

189
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:49.210
nitric oxide,

190
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.600
uh,

191
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.201
supplements,

192
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:54.580
which are all the rage and what some of them are actually fucking dangerous.

193
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:55.211
Like they,

194
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:55.380
they,

195
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.460
that Jack Three d people die on that shit.

196
00:05:58.461 --> 00:05:59.810
Like a woman just died.

197
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.310
She was a,

198
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.600
a marathon runner in London,

199
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.520
like 26 years old.

200
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.130
Get take some Jack Three d runs a marathon.

201
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.960
Boom.

202
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.980
Her ticker just fucking blows.

203
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.800
And if she was laying on the couch watching fucking TV,

204
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:14.090
she would still be alive.

205
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.103
That's what I'm trying to say.

206
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.741
Like,

207
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:16.251
look at this guy,

208
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.320
this vis bode Miller on on it.

209
00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:20.780
Bodie buddy Cody Cody.

210
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.210
He's like a famous skier.

211
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.601
I know.

212
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:24.440
Look at that shit.

213
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:25.880
Could you imagine doing that shit?

214
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.810
I could,

215
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.643
but man,

216
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.700
I have a friend,

217
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.710
a very good friend who was on the US ski team,

218
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:31.544
Doctor Steve.

219
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.490
He's calling the show for when we're explaining the a cyborg physique,

220
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.590
the female Cyborg and how,

221
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.610
how is that possible?

222
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.220
But doctor Steve was on the US ski team and he has massive fucking scars all

223
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:47.240
over his legs.

224
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.283
He's had,

225
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.340
I believe,

226
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.020
some insane number,

227
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:54.260
like 25 26 surgeries on his knees.

228
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.413
Incredible.

229
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.780
The covers of his knees,

230
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.000
whereas cartilages with so chewed away that they resurfaced it with like,

231
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.350
it looks like steel.

232
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.561
I mean,

233
00:07:03.561 --> 00:07:04.251
I don't know what it is.

234
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:06.050
It's like some shiny metal,

235
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.360
I don't know whether it's titanium or what the fuck it is,

236
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:09.580
but they resurface that,

237
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.930
the caps of his fucking bones.

238
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.660
So he doesn't have bone on bone contact anymore.

239
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.240
So this cap sits on the bone and it just,

240
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.740
the roll together,

241
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.170
he's kind of like everything in his knees fucked.

242
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:22.340
He said everything replaced.

243
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.250
Like just last year he had another ACL operation.

244
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.560
I mean it's just over and over and over again.

245
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:28.070
This guy.

246
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.870
And so when I see skiing,

247
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.913
that's what I see.

248
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.120
I see knees.

249
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.301
Yeah.

250
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:32.691
I say,

251
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:32.931
hey,

252
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:33.890
laying on the couch,

253
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:35.330
this would not happen.

254
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.800
So this is what I'm saying.

255
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:38.510
I say balance my friend,

256
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.380
is it balanced and everything?

257
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:41.780
I've had a few operations and my body works great though.

258
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.450
You only have so many heartbeats Joe in the more you use them.

259
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.230
That's not true.

260
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.790
It is true.

261
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.920
No,

262
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.753
it's not true.

263
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.390
Do you think that fat people's hearts just beat it extra fast and that's why

264
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:51.290
they died off quick?

265
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:51.950
Yeah.

266
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:52.450
No.

267
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.300
Being Obese,

268
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:56.060
your body's not just not healthy.

269
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:57.980
I would imagine if you did,

270
00:07:57.981 --> 00:07:59.780
if you actually did only have a hundred you know,

271
00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:01.330
a certain amount of heartbeats and there's,

272
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.240
that was the key.

273
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.560
The key was just like

274
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.730
just staying calm.

275
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.380
But then what about good movies?

276
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:10.300
What about blowjobs?

277
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.320
What about a lot of shit that gets your heart rate up?

278
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.041
Well that's okay,

279
00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:18.041
but if you're spending an hour a day doing it time 50 you know that's a lot of

280
00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:18.944
heartbeats.

281
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.630
Instead of like getting like a quick blow job.

282
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.493
That's,

283
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:23.540
you mean if an hour,

284
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:24.710
a day of exercise,

285
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.860
hardcore exercise as opposed to your regimen of [inaudible] job in TV.

286
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.440
Don't you think though you would like have better performance in this podcasting

287
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:36.880
and in,

288
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.600
in your life.

289
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.210
Just have to move my face a lot so you're just happy with your body.

290
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.110
Just doing the minimum amount and get you from point a to point B because I

291
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:47.090
don't want a thousand knee surgeries.

292
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:49.220
I don't want to fucking ringworm on my asshole.

293
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.080
Look at any of that shit.

294
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:51.990
I want to,

295
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.290
I want to be clean and and and luck.

296
00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.380
Luxurious for women so that they will be scared.

297
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:00.100
homey.com okay.

298
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.440
You're a fucking pussy.

299
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.271
I'll be scared.

300
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.770
A little ring worm on your butt hole.

301
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:07.670
Brody Miller.

302
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:08.660
Bodie.

303
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.493
Cody Miller.

304
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:10.911
Yeah.

305
00:09:10.911 --> 00:09:11.571
Looking at that guy.

306
00:09:11.571 --> 00:09:14.330
Skiing is kind of fuck it looks like a fucking tron guy.

307
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:14.541
Yeah.

308
00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:16.160
It doesn't even look like a Ninja.

309
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.600
How fast do you think he's going to?

310
00:09:17.601 --> 00:09:19.580
Probably like 50 or 60 fucking miles an hour,

311
00:09:19.581 --> 00:09:19.920
right?

312
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.753
Dad,

313
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:21.810
look at his poles.

314
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.030
All Ben didn't know shit silly.

315
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.970
That's trippy as ridiculous to an out of mushrooms.

316
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
He must be fucking flying right there.

317
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.920
Ooh,

318
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.420
I snowplow and I don't ever go that far.

319
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.100
The scariest thing for me is the same people that are doing those,

320
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.580
those things where they drop them off a helicopter on a snowboard and they'd go

321
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.080
down the side of a fucking mountain.

322
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:43.620
Yeah.

323
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.330
Those guys are,

324
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.130
and I'm moles and that's how he times,

325
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.890
sorry,

326
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:48.561
I just going to say it.

327
00:09:48.561 --> 00:09:51.300
And sometimes like they get caught in avalanches and the avalanche is like

328
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:54.630
behind them as they're coming down it terrifying to watch.

329
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.900
That's why you guys have this strong bone and joint Bolling choices are no g at

330
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:04.210
the end of that cause that's the actual active ingredients called strong.

331
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.300
I don't have my up my computer in front of me.

332
00:10:07.301 --> 00:10:08.440
I Google you the uh,

333
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.303
the ingredients.

334
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.780
Um,

335
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.010
I forgot to bring my laptop.

336
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:13.870
Do you want to borrow one?

337
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.873
Yeah,

338
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.460
I dunno.

339
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.270
I got a mini,

340
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:16.990
I'm not sure.

341
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.231
Yeah,

342
00:10:17.231 --> 00:10:19.540
maybe just in case I need to Google some shit.

343
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.770
Cause I do often times talk out of my ass and I like to correct myself.

344
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.140
Let's see if there's battery here.

345
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:27.670
Anyway,

346
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.460
go to [inaudible] dot com and check out the full range of supplements.

347
00:10:30.461 --> 00:10:30.791
And again,

348
00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:31.840
use a codename Rogan.

349
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.460
You'll save yourself 10% off.

350
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:37.600
That doesn't apply to the fitness equipment because we literally sell it as

351
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.040
cheap as humanly possible.

352
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.340
As far as I know that we have the,

353
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.050
the cheapest battle ropes that you can get on the Internet and that's another

354
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.063
great workout.

355
00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:45.903
A piece of equip.

356
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.950
Who else sells battle ropes?

357
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.650
I thought you guys were done under oh there's other guys.

358
00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:50.800
Yeah,

359
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.280
sure.

360
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:51.911
Like you know,

361
00:10:51.911 --> 00:10:54.370
people that are really in the strength and fitness,

362
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:54.911
you know,

363
00:10:54.911 --> 00:10:55.510
um,

364
00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.290
I want to bring,

365
00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.940
start bringing a few other things.

366
00:10:57.941 --> 00:11:01.510
I'm thinking maybe I'm different things to do.

367
00:11:01.511 --> 00:11:05.110
Chin ups with Chin ups I think are very important part of working out as well.

368
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.650
I'm thinking maybe even some of those soft ball handles.

369
00:11:08.651 --> 00:11:10.880
We grab a softball and do chin ups with it.

370
00:11:10.881 --> 00:11:12.130
It's really great for you to grip.

371
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:17.680
You know like so you can have a like our boy Alex Honnold get that kind of grip

372
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.660
scale buildings and shit.

373
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.380
See what I'm saying?

374
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:20.830
Yeah,

375
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:21.550
yeah.

376
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.383
Hey,

377
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:23.151
talk to her.

378
00:11:23.151 --> 00:11:27.810
Lasar or laser laser do these kind of books.

379
00:11:27.811 --> 00:11:30.110
Chelsea even existing where where you have like old books and stuff.

380
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.070
Because now it's just like,

381
00:11:31.071 --> 00:11:31.281
you know,

382
00:11:31.281 --> 00:11:32.840
a touch of gray or whatever and stuff.

383
00:11:32.841 --> 00:11:34.460
It's not that classy looking,

384
00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:35.001
but yeah.

385
00:11:35.001 --> 00:11:36.650
Old dudes love that look,

386
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:41.360
that look of the shiny outside of the book of the most likely never fucking red.

387
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.790
They love that shit and it's like Shit like Pinocchio,

388
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:44.350
right?

389
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.340
Like Pinocchio and Joel's.

390
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:46.761
Yeah.

391
00:11:46.761 --> 00:11:47.421
Quite honestly,

392
00:11:47.421 --> 00:11:47.961
I trust you.

393
00:11:47.961 --> 00:11:48.191
Wait,

394
00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:48.561
laughs.

395
00:11:48.561 --> 00:11:50.540
If I go over your house and you have a lot of that shit,

396
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.220
if you have books like that,

397
00:11:52.221 --> 00:11:52.611
I really,

398
00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:54.580
I will think you're a manufacturer person.

399
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.140
What are you reading?

400
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:56.291
Oh,

401
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:57.011
Peter Pan.

402
00:11:57.011 --> 00:11:57.251
That's,

403
00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:57.940
that's nice.

404
00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.061
Well,

405
00:11:58.061 --> 00:11:58.811
it's not even that.

406
00:11:58.811 --> 00:11:59.171
It's like,

407
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:00.310
look at the volume.

408
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.810
Look at how those books look.

409
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.370
I mean like who is this guy?

410
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:03.561
What?

411
00:12:03.561 --> 00:12:03.790
What?

412
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.930
What the fuck are you buying?

413
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:08.830
Where are you buying these [inaudible] you just getting this all as a big set

414
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:10.090
that makes you look classing.

415
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.900
What is this?

416
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.550
I bet there's some secrets in these books.

417
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.650
I bet you open it up with this fucking guns and they're cutout.

418
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.180
Every one of them's got a gun in it.

419
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.550
Get it's Reptilian.

420
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.790
Could you imagine if every one of his fucking books was actually just a gun

421
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:28.120
holder and this whole time he's smiling and then one day the dot.

422
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.600
If someone goes to pick up the book and he,

423
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.920
they pick up the wrong one or gun falls out and I'm like,

424
00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:33.754
what the fuck?

425
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:34.870
And then they realize,

426
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.460
dude had a hundred guns who's just super compulsive and he collected handguns

427
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.720
and put them inside books,

428
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:41.603
right?

429
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.490
That's why none of those,

430
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.230
nobody wants to ever read those books.

431
00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:49.231
If you have one of those Shiny Bang books with the old style binding,

432
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.721
it's real,

433
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:50.554
super fancy.

434
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.820
You have one of those in your shelf.

435
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.560
Who the fuck's gonna pick that up and read it?

436
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.570
Even a robber's not going to read that.

437
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.790
No one would ever touch it.

438
00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.770
This is subliminal of paint.

439
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:01.210
Big Penis says right here.

440
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.030
The only way someone's going to touch that as if you left a little kid in the

441
00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:04.960
room by himself.

442
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.360
That's the only way those books getting touched,

443
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:08.620
but a grown adult,

444
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:09.331
we'll do that.

445
00:13:09.331 --> 00:13:10.240
That's like DNA.

446
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.620
When you reverse him.

447
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:17.170
Look at verse eight he becomes say tonic and then all that shit becomes DNA.

448
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.381
Well,

449
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:19.510
this is rude because it's kind of like works for on it.

450
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.433
Oh,

451
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.470
obviously he's not really reptilian laser gentlemen.

452
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:24.221
He's or he's,

453
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:25.630
he's world renowned.

454
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.140
Neurophysicist you shouldn't do this to his image,

455
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.983
dude.

456
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.370
He worked in fuckhead my books Skyworks four on it.

457
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:33.790
I know.

458
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.450
You probably shouldn't do this to go and look.

459
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:36.430
If he gets mad,

460
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.600
he's happy about it.

461
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.650
You don't know about that.

462
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:39.484
You can't do that.

463
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.090
Well,

464
00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:40.923
look at this picture.

465
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.130
That's not him.

466
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:42.840
Anyway.

467
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.770
Scan on to who he really is.

468
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:45.683
Yeah.

469
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.423
That's funny.

470
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.350
That's idea.

471
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:56.830
Is that a photo shop?

472
00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.600
Did you use Photoshop?

473
00:13:58.601 --> 00:13:59.231
This you've no,

474
00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:00.011
I promise you.

475
00:14:00.011 --> 00:14:01.060
Well that is hilarious.

476
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.860
Maybe that's what he used to look like,

477
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.180
but then they said on it said,

478
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:04.810

We will all apologies to the good doctor.

485
00:14:20.171 --> 00:14:22.450
We were just joking around and uh,

486
00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:22.670

491
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:26.800

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:31.980
Sporty.

496
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:32.530
All right.

497
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.300
Go to go to on a.com.

505
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:46.810
but you get,

506
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:47.650
you get to love them.

507
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:49.000
Trust me right now.

508
00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:49.301
I know.

509
00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:49.960
It's weird.

510
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.621
It's tenuous,

511
00:14:50.621 --> 00:14:51.321
but trust me,

512
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:52.154
he's a good dude.

513
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.110
<v 1>All right to the podcast.</v>

514
00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.253
<v 2>Fuck.</v>

515
00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.193
<v 1>Okay.</v>

516
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.351
Powerful.

517
00:15:05.351 --> 00:15:06.184
Brian red band.

518
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.930
It's just you and me buddy.

519
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.840
We haven't done this one of these for a while and it's crazy for me.

520
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:11.111
Did you,

521
00:15:11.111 --> 00:15:14.200
have you got a little laptop and I got to get the charger.

522
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.153
Okay.

523
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.151
The,

524
00:15:16.151 --> 00:15:16.570
um,

525
00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.490
we're waiting for freeway.

526
00:15:18.491 --> 00:15:19.480
Rick Ross,

527
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:20.380
I should say.

528
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.213
I say freeway.

529
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:21.971
Rick Ross,

530
00:15:21.971 --> 00:15:26.470
because we have to make the distinction between him and the guy who was the

531
00:15:26.471 --> 00:15:28.810
rapper who calls himself Rick Ross,

532
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.230
who says he got his nickname through some other,

533
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.030
he has got some wacky,

534
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.740
it's explanation for why he has the same name as this guy who was once an

535
00:15:38.741 --> 00:15:39.574
actual,

536
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:44.320
a huge drug dealer who was actually involved unbeknownst to him,

537
00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:49.650
to the whole Iran Contra scandal because back when the CIA or whoever the hell

538
00:15:51.311 --> 00:15:52.121
it was was,

539
00:15:52.121 --> 00:15:52.320
uh,

540
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.250
illegally selling drugs,

541
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:54.970
uh,

542
00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:59.970
in Los Angeles to fund covert operations overseas that they didn't want to get

543
00:16:00.641 --> 00:16:01.450
approval for it.

544
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.830
It's really kind of crazy shit.

545
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.150
This guy was involved in that.

546
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.530
Unbeknownst to him,

547
00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:10.531
he was just out there slang and it was just out this slang in and didn't realize

548
00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:15.370
that he was making so much money because he was sort of in cahoots with Uncle

549
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:15.640
Sam.

550
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:15.731
Well,

551
00:16:15.731 --> 00:16:16.780
not even Uncle Sam,

552
00:16:16.781 --> 00:16:17.081
just,

553
00:16:17.081 --> 00:16:17.914
you know,

554
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.710
corrupt aspects of Uncle Sam.

555
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:22.271
I mean,

556
00:16:22.271 --> 00:16:24.640
I'm sure you can't say all of Uncle Sam's corrupt.

557
00:16:24.641 --> 00:16:25.870
That would be pretty douchey.

558
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.730
Do you think we got to our yesterday?

559
00:16:27.731 --> 00:16:28.500
I think we did.

560
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:28.740
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

561
00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.070
I kind of felt bad.

562
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.091
You feel bad.

563
00:16:31.091 --> 00:16:31.480
Why?

564
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.090
Because it's seemed like,

565
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.900
it very reminded me of just,

566
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.400
how are you thinking like this?

567
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:39.971
Like,

568
00:16:39.971 --> 00:16:40.300
like,

569
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.133
Oh shit,

570
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:45.310
maybe we should have done this off the air because maybe this is like he's going

571
00:16:45.311 --> 00:16:45.971
through some shit.

572
00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:47.590
Like maybe he's smoking too much weed.

573
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.990
Like maybe he's fucking like,

574
00:16:49.991 --> 00:16:51.280
what if he is smoking?

575
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.310
Just mad amounts?

576
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.580
<v 1>Well it definitely is,</v>

577
00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:54.780
but I don't think it's that.

578
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.590
I just think it's a matter of our is a very smart guy.

579
00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.660
And when you,

580
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.050
when you're a smart person and you see something that's really stupid,

581
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:09.240
you can have a really adverse reaction to it where it gets a logical and he's,

582
00:17:09.241 --> 00:17:09.390
uh,

583
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.400
he's allowing himself to get a logical,

584
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.950
and he's allowing himself to get upset at those people.

585
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:18.390
And the end result is you're not really being victimized.

586
00:17:18.391 --> 00:17:18.541
You're,

587
00:17:18.541 --> 00:17:19.081
yes,

588
00:17:19.081 --> 00:17:19.321
you're,

589
00:17:19.321 --> 00:17:22.440
you're losing a little bit of the privacy of what you bring on board.

590
00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:22.811
But we,

591
00:17:22.811 --> 00:17:25.530
we understand that and we know we're going to do that.

592
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.290
But I think Ari had to relook at it.

593
00:17:28.291 --> 00:17:29.370
And I think once he did,

594
00:17:29.371 --> 00:17:31.440
he started like seeing it a different way,

595
00:17:31.441 --> 00:17:35.850
which shows you how smart he is to know that he can get caught up in a fucked up

596
00:17:35.851 --> 00:17:36.684
way of thinking.

597
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.850
But it's just that can happen to you.

598
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:39.330
Yeah.

599
00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.790
He can get caught up in a fucked up way of thinking and it's,

600
00:17:41.791 --> 00:17:43.290
it's not beneficial.

601
00:17:43.291 --> 00:17:44.124
It's not,

602
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.050
and it's not the only way you could look at it,

603
00:17:46.051 --> 00:17:47.640
but it seems like it is at the time.

604
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.670
At the time it just seems like the way go and you're like,

605
00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:50.821
no,

606
00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:51.654
fuck that.

607
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:52.703
But really,

608
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.710
you know when you look at all this shit to be pissed at,

609
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:56.790
that's not,

610
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.623
that's not up there.

611
00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.260
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

612
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.250
And you could tell you what he was kind of realizing it know,

613
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.460
so near the end of it,

614
00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:04.080
you can tell he was second guessing himself.

615
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.063
<v 1>All right,</v>

616
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.170
well you know his,

617
00:18:06.171 --> 00:18:07.960
his point about the seats,

618
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.980
the plane seats makes more sense,

619
00:18:09.981 --> 00:18:10.700
but still,

620
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.720
he's our,

621
00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:12.531
he's a good dude.

622
00:18:12.531 --> 00:18:12.831
He's a,

623
00:18:12.831 --> 00:18:14.120
he really is a good person.

624
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:15.110
He's just got,

625
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:15.680
you know,

626
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.311
he's got a little,

627
00:18:16.311 --> 00:18:19.700
a little better anger that comes out of him sometimes when it comes to certain

628
00:18:19.701 --> 00:18:20.361
things and when,

629
00:18:20.361 --> 00:18:22.430
when he gets angry about something,

630
00:18:22.431 --> 00:18:25.280
like it's very hard for him to look at any other point of view.

631
00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.660
But that's super common.

632
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.411
You know,

633
00:18:27.411 --> 00:18:27.741
a lot.

634
00:18:27.741 --> 00:18:27.891
I've,

635
00:18:27.891 --> 00:18:28.130
I've,

636
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.540
I used to have that a lot.

637
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:33.590
I used to have a real problem with once I got angry about something I can never

638
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:34.760
think that,

639
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.060
uh,

640
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.880
it was my fault that it started in the first place.

641
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:42.110
I always try to justify it for myself and then I had to like look at that and

642
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.320
I'm like,

643
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:42.520
wait,

644
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.190
why am I,

645
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.590
why am I making excuses for this?

646
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.070
Like,

647
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.870
look at this for what it actually is.

648
00:18:47.871 --> 00:18:48.021
Like,

649
00:18:48.021 --> 00:18:48.261
what,

650
00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:48.711
what,

651
00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:50.270
what actually is going on there?

652
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.570
It's very hard to do and a lot of people are bad at it,

653
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.201
you know?

654
00:18:54.201 --> 00:18:56.390
And it doesn't mean that you're a bad person.

655
00:18:56.391 --> 00:19:00.350
It means you can get caught in a fucked up way of thinking and so you'll just

656
00:19:00.351 --> 00:19:01.220
snap,

657
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.551
you know?

658
00:19:01.551 --> 00:19:03.270
And for Ari could have been something else.

659
00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:04.460
It could have been a girl problem.

660
00:19:04.461 --> 00:19:05.210
It could have been,

661
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.751
who knows?

662
00:19:05.751 --> 00:19:07.400
It could have been a little bit on edge.

663
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:11.150
And then you get in front of somebody and then they do something that you think

664
00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.650
is just so stupid,

665
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.790
just fucking still.

666
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.050
And then before you know it,

667
00:19:15.051 --> 00:19:15.220
you're,

668
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.460
you don't even know what you're doing.

669
00:19:16.461 --> 00:19:18.650
You're just yelling at someone and you know you're not,

670
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.080
you're not taking a big deep breath and going,

671
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.340
what is this really?

672
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:22.701
You know,

673
00:19:22.701 --> 00:19:22.850
how,

674
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.860
how much of it an inconvenience is this?

675
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.420
How much should I be reacting?

676
00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:27.890
What is really going on here?

677
00:19:27.891 --> 00:19:30.930
I see a bunch of people doing their job and the ultimate goal is to stop playing

678
00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:31.660
from blowing up.

679
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.493
It's Ah,

680
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.433
you know,

681
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.270
but that's once you're there,

682
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.190
once you're at 10 you know,

683
00:19:37.191 --> 00:19:37.941
like he was like,

684
00:19:37.941 --> 00:19:40.250
he was yelling at them and shit like he was,

685
00:19:40.251 --> 00:19:41.630
he was at 10 he was at,

686
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.190
he was at the point where I was lost.

687
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:43.971
I was going,

688
00:19:43.971 --> 00:19:44.631
God damn it,

689
00:19:44.631 --> 00:19:46.340
I'm going to have to get a fucking lawyer.

690
00:19:46.341 --> 00:19:47.750
I'm going to have to call a lawyer.

691
00:19:47.751 --> 00:19:47.931
Like,

692
00:19:47.931 --> 00:19:49.220
how do I get a guy out of jail?

693
00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:50.930
I've never had to get somebody out of jail.

694
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.490
So if Ari gold,

695
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.600
if he gets arrested,

696
00:19:53.601 --> 00:19:53.841
I'm like,

697
00:19:53.841 --> 00:19:54.141
fuck,

698
00:19:54.141 --> 00:19:55.040
what do I have to do here?

699
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.110
You know,

700
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.680
<v 3>he needs,</v>

701
00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.590
he seems like he needs to get back into doing Jujitsu.

702
00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.080
Like he seems like he has these rage issues,

703
00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:02.500
you know,

704
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.640
like in the past too with,

705
00:20:03.641 --> 00:20:03.851
you know,

706
00:20:03.851 --> 00:20:05.260
like Bobby and with that,

707
00:20:05.261 --> 00:20:06.430
with all that other stuff.

708
00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.830
And I think

709
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.360
<v 1>it would certainly help him if he had some sort of serious exercise.</v>

710
00:20:11.361 --> 00:20:12.710
But I don't think he's really into it.

711
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.370
Yeah,

712
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:13.881
he does.

713
00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:14.510
Um,

714
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.350
basketball.

715
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.570
I know he does that like once a week or something like that.

716
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:17.791
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

717
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:19.590
But not basketball with black guys basketball.

718
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.300
He plays basketball with little comics.

719
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.290
All the cigarettes.

720
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.020
Yeah.

721
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:28.853
It's so true.

722
00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.160
<v 1>True that basketball is a joke kind of cardio.</v>

723
00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:33.060
Those fucks have.

724
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.101
<v 3>Oh yeah.</v>

725
00:20:37.101 --> 00:20:38.110
I think Mervin is sound of,

726
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:38.310
you know,

727
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.691
murders.

728
00:20:38.691 --> 00:20:40.490
He's this big guy that plays one of the,

729
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.310
the capital one commercial vikings.

730
00:20:43.311 --> 00:20:44.930
He's on the basketball team.

731
00:20:44.931 --> 00:20:45.470
Awesome.

732
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.350
This guy's a huge guy.

733
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:47.591
Oh,

734
00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:48.424
that's funny.

735
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.650
<v 0>The capital one vikings commercial,</v>

736
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:50.861
you know,

737
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:51.694
like,

738
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.690
do you buy things based on cool commercials?

739
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:56.890
Do you ever do that?

740
00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.283
Ah,

741
00:20:58.570 --> 00:20:59.021
no,

742
00:20:59.021 --> 00:20:59.920
but it really,

743
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.810
it really tells me like,

744
00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:02.290
Hey,

745
00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:02.981
like so knows,

746
00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:06.100
I don't know if anyone has so notices this is a company that has this Bluetooth

747
00:21:06.101 --> 00:21:07.150
speaker and it's fucking,

748
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:07.991
it sounds amazing.

749
00:21:07.991 --> 00:21:09.910
I bought them for my whole family for Christmas.

750
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:10.451
Uh,

751
00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:11.450
it's just a little blue speed.

752
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.460
You go on your iPhone and it just,

753
00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:14.890
it's,

754
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:15.723
it's great.

755
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.593
And uh,

756
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.660
as an extra small,

757
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:18.610
like a rectangle,

758
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:18.880
right?

759
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.091
Yeah.

760
00:21:19.091 --> 00:21:20.240
It's like a little little box.

761
00:21:20.241 --> 00:21:21.790
There's a little blue in the center of it.

762
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:22.873
I just got it.

763
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:23.090
It's,

764
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.740
it's great.

765
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.150
It's one of my favorite things ever.

766
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:26.580
Especially like in your bedroom,

767
00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:26.740
just,

768
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.573
yeah.

769
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.820
What was I talking about now?

770
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.351
Oh,

771
00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:29.921
you're so high.

772
00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:30.370
Look at you.

773
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:31.380
What were we just talking about?

774
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:31.841
You're talking about,

775
00:21:31.841 --> 00:21:33.910
I know a Bluetooth,

776
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:34.960
I don't know shit.

777
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:35.801
What?

778
00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:37.150
Commercials buying something.

779
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:37.660
Oh,

780
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.490
they have this really cool commercial.

781
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.690
As an example,

782
00:21:40.691 --> 00:21:41.051
I was like,

783
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:42.670
what is this Bluetooth speaker?

784
00:21:42.671 --> 00:21:45.400
And I went on Amazon and read some reviews and stuff like that.

785
00:21:45.401 --> 00:21:46.240
And I did kind of,

786
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:47.260
it Kinda made me go,

787
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.360
well if they have such a cool commercial,

788
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.560
they are a coal company.

789
00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.660
Cause you know they have a cool marketing company,

790
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.210
they have a cool advertising company they hired.

791
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.240
I mean have you ever gone to someone's website and you know they suck but the

792
00:21:58.241 --> 00:21:59.140
website's awesome.

793
00:21:59.260 --> 00:21:59.890
Yeah.

794
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:01.180
Let me just hired so many cool,

795
00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:01.910
right?

796
00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:02.560
I figured it out.

797
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.130
Yeah,

798
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.440
but there's a certain ads we're like,

799
00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:06.274
you know,

800
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.990
out of respect,

801
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:08.860
you know,

802
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:09.760
you see the ad,

803
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:10.810
you'll your buy shit.

804
00:22:10.811 --> 00:22:14.920
Like I know somebody who buys Geico because she thinks the Geico ad is

805
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:15.970
hilarious.

806
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:16.390
Right.

807
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.101
So she's always like,

808
00:22:17.101 --> 00:22:17.610
she's like,

809
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.450
you ever seen the one when pigs can fly?

810
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:19.751
Yeah.

811
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:21.670
It's so much better than like say progressive.

812
00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:22.600
I don't want to fuck that girl.

813
00:22:22.601 --> 00:22:23.530
Why you hit her?

814
00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:24.071
We got away from it.

815
00:22:24.071 --> 00:22:24.371
Okay.

816
00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:25.180
That's not true.

817
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.590
A lot of guys want to fuck that girl.

818
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.710
Really Progressive Group or I don't want that.

819
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.170
A lot of dudes have a type like that,

820
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.221
I guess.

821
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:33.590
Do you have a,

822
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:34.423
do you have a weird type?

823
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.931
Yeah,

824
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:35.764
Asian

825
00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.013
at all.

826
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.393
They're amazing men.

827
00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.540
For white people from Ohio.

828
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.110
That's about as exotic cars yet.

829
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:43.043
Right?

830
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:44.280
They're cute too.

831
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:45.320
Yeah.

832
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.340
They're like little toys,

833
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.830
Asian girls.

834
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:47.663
Very attractive.

835
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.053
I don't know.

836
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:49.570
Did you like,

837
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:50.470
did you always like Asians?

838
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.393
Not Oh yeah.

839
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:52.973
Um,

840
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.823
I think uh,

841
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.880
Asians are,

842
00:22:54.881 --> 00:22:55.714
uh,

843
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.111
the,

844
00:22:56.111 --> 00:22:58.110
the idea for white guys.

845
00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:58.780
Whoa,

846
00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.650
it's exotic.

847
00:22:59.651 --> 00:23:00.580
This is crazy.

848
00:23:00.581 --> 00:23:04.210
She's like another species and they're super smart.

849
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:04.871
You know,

850
00:23:04.871 --> 00:23:07.720
you get all the danger without dating a black check,

851
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:09.813
you know,

852
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.713
you get,

853
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.580
you get all the,

854
00:23:12.581 --> 00:23:17.290
the danger of being around someone alien culture.

855
00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.310
Yeah.

856
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.880
But he gives us exotic sex girl that's like,

857
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:22.570
you know,

858
00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.110
thought to be like really submissive and you know,

859
00:23:25.111 --> 00:23:27.400
like that's what people was a little like the Asian girls will stay in their

860
00:23:27.401 --> 00:23:29.980
place and there'll be submissive and take care of their man.

861
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.150
And like guys will say,

862
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:31.661
Oh,

863
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:32.680
I got an Asian wife.

864
00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:33.191
I'll tell you what,

865
00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:34.600
I'll never go back to white girls again.

866
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.310
A lot of guys say shit like that.

867
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.300
You know?

868
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:41.290
Is it a certain part of your age that you become a Vietnam Vietnam vet?

869
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:41.651
Like,

870
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:41.840
like,

871
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.001
dude,

872
00:23:42.001 --> 00:23:46.060
like that you just get into Asians like hardcore because it seems like listening

873
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.963
<v 3>to that question,</v>

874
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:47.451
if you,

875
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:48.310
if you use that right

876
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:49.040
<v 1>question,</v>

877
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.460
you could use that in court to the judge to like if on paper,

878
00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:54.210
the way that's where that question was written there,

879
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.193
they would like,

880
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.410
it would take away whoever's taking care of you.

881
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.470
They would bring it to somewhere else that says something wrong with his

882
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:01.304
development.

883
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.450
Look at the way he's talking.

884
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.800
<v 3>I knew this one Asian girl that she would clean me every night and it was,</v>

885
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.910
she put lotion under my eyes and then clean my fingers and make that popping

886
00:24:09.911 --> 00:24:10.900
noise and stuff and like,

887
00:24:10.901 --> 00:24:11.560
Whoa,

888
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.300
you this for professional.

889
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:18.130
Like how do you know to do that popping noise on your fingers and then taking

890
00:24:18.131 --> 00:24:20.300
care of you and washes me what that wash cloth.

891
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:21.671
It's amazing.

892
00:24:21.671 --> 00:24:22.330
But then you know,

893
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:26.720
normal girls are just like trying to puke and like your trashcan and stuff and

894
00:24:26.721 --> 00:24:26.910
then,

895
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:27.360
<v 1>well,</v>

896
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:27.811
yeah,

897
00:24:27.811 --> 00:24:29.910
I mean will you get in real personal here fellow,

898
00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.253
but um,

899
00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.370
your situation,

900
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.120
uh,

901
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:33.780
you know,

902
00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.280
without talking about it.

903
00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:36.241
Yeah.

904
00:24:36.241 --> 00:24:38.310
I mean you got told us about my current situation,

905
00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:38.450
right?

906
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.720
Know it's not your current situation,

907
00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:41.910
but that situation that Greg,

908
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:42.631
you know,

909
00:24:42.631 --> 00:24:47.280
you either get that and you have a nice girl who takes care of you or you go on

910
00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.310
wild freak sex orgies when you're on extra.

911
00:24:49.311 --> 00:24:50.144
So

912
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:56.400
those are your two options in this world that you find yourself in.

913
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.650
You're presented with very unique challenges.

914
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.951
You know,

915
00:24:58.951 --> 00:25:00.090
not a lot of people have those,

916
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.170
those problems.

917
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:02.000
You know,

918
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.120
with the most guys,

919
00:25:03.121 --> 00:25:04.620
the problem was actually just getting laid.

920
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:05.491
You,

921
00:25:05.491 --> 00:25:05.941
it's a,

922
00:25:05.941 --> 00:25:07.590
the problem is trying to figure out,

923
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:08.460
you know,

924
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:08.870
it's,

925
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.050
it's a crazy world,

926
00:25:10.051 --> 00:25:11.220
but when you're talented,

927
00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.190
when you're in a position,

928
00:25:14.191 --> 00:25:16.710
when you have some people paying attention to you,

929
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.040
you get like superpowers and you,

930
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.850
you've right now you got freak superpowers.

931
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.960
So you've got to deal with that.

932
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:27.310
And the only way to deal with that as either you go on a fuck rampage or you

933
00:25:28.321 --> 00:25:29.041
find a good one,

934
00:25:29.041 --> 00:25:29.760
you settled down.

935
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.550
Those are your two options because uh,

936
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:33.503
you know,

937
00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:38.370
you either you either use that power for evil and they go out there and spread

938
00:25:38.371 --> 00:25:39.204
your super aids

939
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:42.203
or,

940
00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.261
or are you a,

941
00:25:43.261 --> 00:25:44.220
you find a good girl.

942
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.820
The problem is finding someone that you actually like and then finding someone

943
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.920
that you can actually tolerate for long periods of time and then like actually

944
00:25:52.921 --> 00:25:54.420
still enjoying being around them.

945
00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:55.410
It's so rare.

946
00:25:55.411 --> 00:25:58.740
It's so rare and it's not necessarily the man's problem.

947
00:25:58.741 --> 00:26:00.270
It's not necessarily the woman's problem.

948
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.320
It's like the eye,

949
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:06.350
the odds of you finding someone that whatever's wrong with them fits in with

950
00:26:07.171 --> 00:26:08.520
whatever's wrong with you.

951
00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:12.510
And they both like clank and then like fit in perfect and you actually enhance

952
00:26:12.511 --> 00:26:13.344
each other.

953
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.600
You actually make each other's lives better.

954
00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.371
You can do that,

955
00:26:17.371 --> 00:26:18.840
but it's fucking stupid.

956
00:26:18.841 --> 00:26:19.674
Hard to find,

957
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:20.401
you know,

958
00:26:20.401 --> 00:26:23.610
it is possible but you're definitely not going to find it when you're doing

959
00:26:23.611 --> 00:26:25.380
those coke ecstasy

960
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.800
binge situations.

961
00:26:28.801 --> 00:26:29.041
Like,

962
00:26:29.041 --> 00:26:29.701
then you're just,

963
00:26:29.701 --> 00:26:32.910
it's all about rehydrating and then you know,

964
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.520
finding out how long do you have to wait before you dig and get hard again every

965
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:37.980
day with those pillows,

966
00:26:37.981 --> 00:26:38.814
Joe?

967
00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:39.331
Yeah,

968
00:26:39.331 --> 00:26:40.260
but I'm telling you,

969
00:26:40.261 --> 00:26:40.471
man,

970
00:26:40.471 --> 00:26:41.940
you might break something in your brain.

971
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:43.980
I don't think you're supposed to take shit every day.

972
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:44.963
<v 3>I don't actually,</v>

973
00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.720
well w I would say once a week I do that.

974
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:49.830
It's like you're so crazy.

975
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:50.041
You don't,

976
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:51.570
even by the pharmaceuticals,

977
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:55.230
you just go to that fucking drugstore counter Mexican Tacos,

978
00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:00.780
go get that shit at the gas station that's sitting on the front counter.

979
00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.060
I think I had to get one at seven 11 the other day.

980
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.410
What the fuck's in there?

981
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.270
I know I got this one at seven 11 yet.

982
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.640
The other day I showed you in Vegas that says on the big thing,

983
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:09.540
it's like a,

984
00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.640
it's like watch out for counterfeits,

985
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.710
but it's printed onto the box.

986
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:14.131
Like,

987
00:27:14.131 --> 00:27:18.180
why would they even say watch out for counterfeits and it was such a huge symbol

988
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.050
and then on the back it was like also peel this off off if you want to use it as

989
00:27:22.051 --> 00:27:23.690
a calling card or something like,

990
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:27.630
so it was a calling card slash a dick pill thing.

991
00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.670
You could like use like long distance.

992
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:31.860
You can make it like a gift card.

993
00:27:31.861 --> 00:27:33.930
Like when you go to it like a gift card place.

994
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.291
It was,

995
00:27:34.291 --> 00:27:34.610
I don't know,

996
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.120
it was fucking weird gift card.

997
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.160
Are you talking about a calling card?

998
00:27:38.161 --> 00:27:39.510
Like for like a payphone?

999
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.590
It was like the payphone.

1000
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.520
Yeah.

1001
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:41.701
Yeah.

1002
00:27:41.701 --> 00:27:43.200
It was just like they still sell those.

1003
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.150
Do they still remember when 800 collect?

1004
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.320
Remember when that was around?

1005
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.131
That was a big thing.

1006
00:27:47.131 --> 00:27:47.850
There was all those uh,

1007
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:51.190
when 800 collect companies remember that there was like,

1008
00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:51.520
no,

1009
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.710
there was a sprint one.

1010
00:27:52.711 --> 00:27:53.570
Oh yeah,

1011
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.413
that's right.

1012
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:55.351
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1013
00:27:55.351 --> 00:27:56.770
They would offer you what did,

1014
00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:00.420
what are those things that are offering you like a phone that you use through

1015
00:28:00.421 --> 00:28:01.254
the Internet?

1016
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.530
What does that still goes on?

1017
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.100
But it's like a late night commercial.

1018
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.310
It's a phone that works in the,

1019
00:28:06.311 --> 00:28:07.680
it cuts your costs down.

1020
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.570
I the guys dialing internationally.

1021
00:28:09.571 --> 00:28:10.800
Like what is it like a Skype phone,

1022
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:11.260
is that right?

1023
00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:11.760
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1024
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.370
What's that Mr Jack off or something along those lines?

1025
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:15.710
Yeah,

1026
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:16.211
it's,

1027
00:28:16.211 --> 00:28:17.044
it's uh,

1028
00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:17.800
it's,

1029
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.410
you plug it in and it just pretty much does what like Skype does.

1030
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.950
It's just like a USB thing that you attach like headphones too or something like

1031
00:28:23.951 --> 00:28:25.150
that if I remember correctly.

1032
00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.521
But that's all it is.

1033
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:27.940
So it's not like an actual phone,

1034
00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:29.130
it's just like what you know,

1035
00:28:29.131 --> 00:28:30.640
like charter or Skype is,

1036
00:28:30.641 --> 00:28:33.820
are any of these voice over and then you have to do the dialing through a

1037
00:28:33.821 --> 00:28:34.654
computer?

1038
00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:35.051
No,

1039
00:28:35.051 --> 00:28:36.850
I think you could set it up where you can you,

1040
00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:37.300
I don't know.

1041
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:37.900
I don't know.

1042
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.580
I think if there's like a phone jack in it,

1043
00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:40.443
that's what it was.

1044
00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.830
It's a phone Jack on one side.

1045
00:28:41.831 --> 00:28:42.321
On the other side.

1046
00:28:42.321 --> 00:28:44.050
It was a USB plug.

1047
00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:49.080
And what it does is it just pretty much converts your phone into a voice over

1048
00:28:49.931 --> 00:28:51.700
the Internet so it makes it,

1049
00:28:51.701 --> 00:28:54.430
so you're using Skype with but with a phone line.

1050
00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.440
So it will ring in it.

1051
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:56.970
It's,

1052
00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:57.803
Eh,

1053
00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.473
<v 1>why bother with that?</v>

1054
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:00.201
Yeah.

1055
00:29:00.201 --> 00:29:05.201
Well that seems like it was kind of around more when it used to cost money to

1056
00:29:05.571 --> 00:29:09.500
like be like in other states with your phone.

1057
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.230
Right.

1058
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:12.230
Most people don't have like out of state roaming,

1059
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.250
right.

1060
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.090
I don't know anyone.

1061
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.430
You don't have issues without a state.

1062
00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:16.080
Like I,

1063
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.690
as far as I know like the,

1064
00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.940
the minute some I have Verizon,

1065
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.100
I can use it all over the country and I'm not roaming.

1066
00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:22.910
Right,

1067
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:23.270
right.

1068
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.930
But remember if you used to like drive just a little bit out of your house,

1069
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.310
you were fucking roaming.

1070
00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.710
You would be in some area where you don't really have coverage.

1071
00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.720
So you have to use someone else's coverage.

1072
00:29:32.721 --> 00:29:36.170
Some other company and they bill your phone coming and your phone company bills

1073
00:29:36.171 --> 00:29:38.540
you like double or triple or whatever the fuck it was.

1074
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.250
And for then back then there was,

1075
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.900
there was a deal to like make a long distance call.

1076
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.430
Holy Shit.

1077
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.290
Long distance calls were crazy.

1078
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.450
Do you remember when they had phones and planes?

1079
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.830
That's one of the only pieces of technology that slipped backwards was the

1080
00:29:53.831 --> 00:29:54.820
phones and plain.

1081
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.143
<v 3>That's right.</v>

1082
00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.130
You never see that in.

1083
00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.053
<v 1>Never see that.</v>

1084
00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:58.541
You don't,

1085
00:29:58.541 --> 00:30:01.420
when you used to open up your seat in inside your console,

1086
00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:04.780
there was a phone he'd slide a credit card down at and you'd enter in your card

1087
00:30:04.781 --> 00:30:07.720
information and then you would fucking use the phone.

1088
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:08.583
<v 3>You know why?</v>

1089
00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.680
You know why they don't want you to turn on your cell phones and work?

1090
00:30:10.681 --> 00:30:14.220
Because now they don't want anyone that described the terrorist events because

1091
00:30:14.221 --> 00:30:15.210
they're all undercover,

1092
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.050
you know,

1093
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.930
government agents and there's really no hijackers.

1094
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.060
It's like that.

1095
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:20.851
You know what I mean?

1096
00:30:20.851 --> 00:30:24.060
Like they don't want communication just in case if they have to take down

1097
00:30:24.061 --> 00:30:25.080
another plane.

1098
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.790
<v 1>Joan's way of looking at the situation,</v>

1099
00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.950
it's very clear.

1100
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.680
These people don't want you making calls.

1101
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.610
These people are the enemies of liberty.

1102
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:37.901
If you're,

1103
00:30:37.901 --> 00:30:38.290
um,

1104
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.240
if you're on a plane and some shit goes down,

1105
00:30:40.241 --> 00:30:41.680
now you just have to draw pictures

1106
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:43.480
bad.

1107
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.480
It'd be like a sketch artist at a fucking courthouse.

1108
00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:47.170
That's right.

1109
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:49.090
Is that not one of the stupidest gigs ever?

1110
00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:49.631
Like,

1111
00:30:49.631 --> 00:30:50.021
let's,

1112
00:30:50.021 --> 00:30:50.290
uh,

1113
00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:50.681
well,

1114
00:30:50.681 --> 00:30:51.071
you know,

1115
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:51.790
we can,

1116
00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:53.260
you can show what happened,

1117
00:30:53.261 --> 00:30:54.100
but you can't be really,

1118
00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:55.870
really good about describing it.

1119
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.670
So only draw it.

1120
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.220
<v 3>We have s that's show,</v>

1121
00:31:00.221 --> 00:31:01.300
I do Monday,

1122
00:31:01.301 --> 00:31:04.400
we have a sketch artist that draws and we had this guy do a,

1123
00:31:04.401 --> 00:31:05.560
a doctor who,

1124
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:06.190
uh,

1125
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:09.640
drawing sketch artist for real are like a last,

1126
00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.290
that is what is that?

1127
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:11.921
This is,

1128
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:12.940
we have every show,

1129
00:31:12.941 --> 00:31:13.870
but what does that picture?

1130
00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:15.020
So just from doctor who,

1131
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.350
and then all our faces are in,

1132
00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.041
in the stomach.

1133
00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:19.870
There's me and there's Brody

1134
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.900
<v 1>sketch artists are seriously that,</v>

1135
00:31:21.901 --> 00:31:22.810
that the only,

1136
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.960
not the artists themselves are just people with a Gig.

1137
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:29.190
But the idea behind it is seriously one of the most arcane aspects of our,

1138
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:30.660
our judicial system.

1139
00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:32.370
It's fucking ridiculous.

1140
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.310
When you see those photos on TV,

1141
00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:35.700
when a guys in court and you see the,

1142
00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.500
the TV shows you,

1143
00:31:37.501 --> 00:31:38.970
the new shows you a drawing.

1144
00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:39.630
Like,

1145
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:39.990
look,

1146
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:41.700
what the fuck am I sitting here?

1147
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:46.970
That is to me like such a sign of like a fucking dorky world that it's so,

1148
00:31:48.031 --> 00:31:52.410
it's so screwed up and ridiculous and so nonsensical that they'll,

1149
00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:57.650
they'll film or a drawing of some stuff that happened in a time where

1150
00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.030
photographs exist.

1151
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.920
It's not like they're not pretending that they have no idea what happened in

1152
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:03.421
that courthouse.

1153
00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:04.231
We have no news for,

1154
00:32:04.231 --> 00:32:04.771
you know,

1155
00:32:04.771 --> 00:32:07.230
we had a guy in there but they wouldn't let him take pictures,

1156
00:32:07.231 --> 00:32:08.370
but they would let them draw.

1157
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:08.860
You'd be like,

1158
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:09.693
what?

1159
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:11.580
Who the fuck's in charge here?

1160
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.140
You'd,

1161
00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.230
you'd pull them over and go,

1162
00:32:13.231 --> 00:32:14.100
what is this?

1163
00:32:14.101 --> 00:32:14.970
Why is this here?

1164
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.110
Why are we doing here?

1165
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.970
Let them take a fucking picture.

1166
00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.040
It's 2013 asshole.

1167
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.990
You don't need to draw pictures.

1168
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:23.390
Take a fucking

1169
00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:24.010
<v 3>why did,</v>

1170
00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:25.010
did they do that though?

1171
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:25.830
<v 1>Because for someone,</v>

1172
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:26.663
one's a lie.

1173
00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.660
Someone wants to be able to lie.

1174
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:33.690
Someone wants to be able to control the access to the images that get displayed

1175
00:32:33.761 --> 00:32:34.660
from a situation.

1176
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:36.670
Someone wants to be able to control the situation.

1177
00:32:36.671 --> 00:32:37.504
That's all it is.

1178
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.530
If they wanted the American public,

1179
00:32:39.531 --> 00:32:40.610
which they should have,

1180
00:32:40.611 --> 00:32:42.230
especially in cases of criminal cases,

1181
00:32:42.231 --> 00:32:44.900
we have to worry about whether or not this person's a bad person.

1182
00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:46.700
They're out there like trying to victimize people.

1183
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.670
They're trying to limit your access to the,

1184
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:53.510
to how the court works to limit your access to how,

1185
00:32:53.511 --> 00:32:53.781
uh,

1186
00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:54.470
what,

1187
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.330
what actually takes place in a courtroom.

1188
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.790
Because a lot of times it's bullying.

1189
00:32:59.180 --> 00:32:59.600
You know,

1190
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.340
there's a lot of bullshit that goes on in court.

1191
00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.350
There's a lot of shit that goes on in court.

1192
00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:06.470
Did you know the people that get charged with medical marijuana when they get

1193
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:07.160
arrested,

1194
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.110
they get arrested federally most of the time.

1195
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:12.140
And they're not even allowed to use the word medical.

1196
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.930
They can't say medical marijuana.

1197
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.430
They just sold marijuana.

1198
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.110
Like if they use the word medical,

1199
00:33:18.111 --> 00:33:19.040
they're just throw him in jail.

1200
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.170
It says contempt of court.

1201
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.500
They'll throw you in jail because they don't believe that marijuana is a

1202
00:33:24.501 --> 00:33:26.720
medicinal substance or it's not their law.

1203
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:28.070
The federal government,

1204
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.250
they're allowed to say that there is no law.

1205
00:33:31.251 --> 00:33:32.810
So you can't say medical marijuana.

1206
00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:37.811
So even though you're defending yourself in the same country as where medical

1207
00:33:38.871 --> 00:33:40.160
marijuana is legal,

1208
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:44.390
you're not even allowed to bring it up in a federal court if that's not some

1209
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:45.620
crazy bullying,

1210
00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:47.593
you know,

1211
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.320
it's stupid that that day they could censor that.

1212
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:51.711
Yeah.

1213
00:33:51.711 --> 00:33:52.700
It's unbelievable.

1214
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.360
It just,

1215
00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.620
it's w I mean if,

1216
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.330
if people knew about these things,

1217
00:33:56.331 --> 00:33:59.120
if you're watching video footage of courts,

1218
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:00.050
you know,

1219
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:00.680
constant,

1220
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.513
you know?

1221
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:01.950
Yeah.

1222
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:03.680
I know they had court TV for awhile.

1223
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:04.730
That was kind of fascinating.

1224
00:34:04.731 --> 00:34:05.810
That was like our first time,

1225
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.570
I think it wasn't that popular.

1226
00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.570
Mostly cases sucked and quite honestly,

1227
00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:16.550
there's a lot of shit that's more interesting than watching trials all day.

1228
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:18.560
And then they had the Oj trial though.

1229
00:34:18.561 --> 00:34:19.640
That was on court TV too,

1230
00:34:19.641 --> 00:34:20.030
wasn't it?

1231
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.300
Yeah,

1232
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.133
I think so.

1233
00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.130
That was on everything.

1234
00:34:22.131 --> 00:34:25.430
Now remember that that was like a television event that was kind of like Oliver

1235
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.140
North where every channel was all about,

1236
00:34:27.141 --> 00:34:27.231
well,

1237
00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:28.064
all of our north,

1238
00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:32.420
who was the first time we really were pretty sure that a celebrity has killed a

1239
00:34:32.421 --> 00:34:33.254
woman.

1240
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:35.870
Like we're pretty sure you know,

1241
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.930
there was some speculation about other people in the past.

1242
00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.550
I have Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe.

1243
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:41.030
No.

1244
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.750
Yes.

1245
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:42.350
Kennedy.

1246
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:43.183
Marilyn Monroe.

1247
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.700
Yeah.

1248
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.430
A lot of people thought that Marilyn Monroe was talking too much shit,

1249
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.570
but that's what they would always think she could.

1250
00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:49.400
She could have been that.

1251
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.530
She was just a crazy bitch.

1252
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.370
Did a lot of pills or whatever and died.

1253
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.540
I heard she gave him herpes.

1254
00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:54.410
Holy Shit.

1255
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:54.891
You heard that.

1256
00:34:54.891 --> 00:34:55.724
He started it.

1257
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:59.450
Here's the patient zero in the herpes war.

1258
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.960
Did herpes exists before the 16th when with herpes invented?

1259
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.660
I bet it's been around forever.

1260
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:07.100
If I had to guess,

1261
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.900
I'd say that shit came from France.

1262
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.240
Won The patient zero's from France.

1263
00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.093
A guarantee Ya.

1264
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:14.061
Ooh.

1265
00:35:14.061 --> 00:35:18.110
I was actually under a video search on Google when I search for herpes first.

1266
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:18.621
Oh,

1267
00:35:18.621 --> 00:35:19.630
the show too on video.

1268
00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:22.183
Yeah.

1269
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.780
Shingles is apparently a type of herpes genital that shingles is like that shit

1270
00:35:26.781 --> 00:35:29.480
that some people would get this bad breakouts all over the back.

1271
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:29.870
Yeah,

1272
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:30.920
I know somebody that has that.

1273
00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:31.940
It's supposed to be horrible.

1274
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:32.803
Yeah.

1275
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:34.910
I heard somebody got chicken pockets.

1276
00:35:34.911 --> 00:35:38.010
I rare chickenpox the other day at some famous person

1277
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.750
<v 3>and she had had already had chicken pox,</v>

1278
00:35:39.751 --> 00:35:41.280
so it was her second chicken park.

1279
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:42.420
I thought that's never supposed to.

1280
00:35:42.421 --> 00:35:43.890
I know like it was somebody like weird,

1281
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:45.000
like Betty White or somebody.

1282
00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:45.640
<v 1>Why is,</v>

1283
00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.473
yeah,

1284
00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:47.820
if you're that old man,

1285
00:35:47.821 --> 00:35:48.611
you get chicken pox,

1286
00:35:48.611 --> 00:35:51.460
you're fucked when you're really old,

1287
00:35:51.461 --> 00:35:52.960
you have to wash your hands all the time.

1288
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.170
That that should be a meme.

1289
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:58.360
My,

1290
00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.410
if I was going to make fun of me and my points on a unmedical science,

1291
00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:03.431
if you're really old,

1292
00:36:03.431 --> 00:36:04.660
you should wash your hands a lot,

1293
00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.030
but you really should,

1294
00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:08.853
you know,

1295
00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:09.550
that's,

1296
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.800
they say that's one of the best ways to prevent diseases.

1297
00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:12.873
Just uh,

1298
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.900
not constant,

1299
00:36:13.901 --> 00:36:14.740
don't get nutty,

1300
00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.753
but uh,

1301
00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.350
keep your fucking hands clean.

1302
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.300
That's where you pick up most of it.

1303
00:36:19.301 --> 00:36:21.460
I guess going from hand to mouth,

1304
00:36:21.461 --> 00:36:22.420
you don't even realize it.

1305
00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:27.730
It's Kinda rude that we have this a weird war going on between our bodies and

1306
00:36:27.731 --> 00:36:30.670
these strange little things that attack us,

1307
00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:35.970
that make us feel like shit and literally weaken your body and they're so

1308
00:36:36.221 --> 00:36:36.620
common.

1309
00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.391
They happen every year.

1310
00:36:37.391 --> 00:36:39.940
There's a whole season when the attack and some,

1311
00:36:39.941 --> 00:36:41.140
sometimes they get people,

1312
00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:42.250
some people die off.

1313
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:45.070
People that avoid medication,

1314
00:36:45.071 --> 00:36:45.940
people that are old,

1315
00:36:45.941 --> 00:36:47.710
people with compromised immune systems.

1316
00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.270
Colds get them every year.

1317
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:50.463
It's crazy.

1318
00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:52.780
It's like we don't even think about it,

1319
00:36:52.781 --> 00:36:53.950
but colds are monsters.

1320
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:55.990
They're just not that effective.

1321
00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.400
<v 3>Actually,</v>

1322
00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.500
Barbara Walters hit with chicken pox,

1323
00:36:59.501 --> 00:37:00.334
or rare,

1324
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.270
<v 1>a rare version of it.</v>

1325
00:37:02.271 --> 00:37:03.500
Did say she had it already?

1326
00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:08.723
<v 4>No,</v>

1327
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.060
I thought it Sunday.

1328
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.051
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1329
00:37:12.051 --> 00:37:14.210
Why is she knocked vaccinated?

1330
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.530
<v 4>She is an 83</v>

1331
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.410
<v 1>Mama.</v>

1332
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:18.590
Well,

1333
00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:19.980
this is a lot of words.

1334
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:20.903
Yeah.

1335
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:22.470
That sucks though.

1336
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.640
Not that can't be fun.

1337
00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:24.810
Yeah.

1338
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:24.991
Yeah.

1339
00:37:24.991 --> 00:37:28.140
This is one of those weird fucking things like the mumps,

1340
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.670
when the mumps comes around,

1341
00:37:29.671 --> 00:37:31.080
like what is going on?

1342
00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:32.130
What is this shit?

1343
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.420
Where's this coming from?

1344
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:36.690
Like how does that work that all of a sudden some kid has the mumps,

1345
00:37:36.691 --> 00:37:38.430
there's a mumps outbreak in New Jersey.

1346
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.800
Who was the first to get that mumps?

1347
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:41.634
Like how does that,

1348
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.310
how does the something like that reemerge.

1349
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.230
Yeah.

1350
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:49.340
<v 3>Or that that other disease that supposedly porn just got back into porn.</v>

1351
00:37:49.341 --> 00:37:50.180
That was really,

1352
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.830
oh yeah.

1353
00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:51.680
Was that syphilis.

1354
00:37:51.681 --> 00:37:52.221
Syphilis.

1355
00:37:52.221 --> 00:37:52.970
Yeah.

1356
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.950
That's super

1357
00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:55.873
<v 1>dangerous.</v>

1358
00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.010
That shit kills the fuck out of you.

1359
00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.800
I think syphilis is what got Al Capone.

1360
00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:02.653
I'm pretty sure.

1361
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.710
I think syphilis does horrible things to you before it kills you to,

1362
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.360
it's really bad.

1363
00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.101
<v 3>Oh,</v>

1364
00:38:09.101 --> 00:38:09.671
hilarious.

1365
00:38:09.671 --> 00:38:12.460
Court TV is now true TV.

1366
00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:17.490
Really and true TV is the fakeness of all TV show channel.

1367
00:38:17.491 --> 00:38:18.640
So that's crazy.

1368
00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:20.650
Court TV is like,

1369
00:38:20.651 --> 00:38:21.460
you know what,

1370
00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.250
we're losing

1371
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:23.330
<v 1>money on real.</v>

1372
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.340
Let's go get some fake money.

1373
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.930
Let's get some fake.

1374
00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.140
<v 3>I was watching that,</v>

1375
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:28.480
that,

1376
00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.290
that show.

1377
00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:31.360
I just got into that storage wars show.

1378
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:32.620
Oh this is so stupid.

1379
00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:33.480
It's,

1380
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.121
it's one of my,

1381
00:38:34.121 --> 00:38:36.730
it's so addicting because want to see what's inside this things and I'm

1382
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:37.151
thinking,

1383
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:38.620
why doesn't like,

1384
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:38.861
all right,

1385
00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:40.120
these storage companies,

1386
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:40.930
uh,

1387
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.040
auction these off,

1388
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:42.880
right.

1389
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.020
Why don't they just go through it and then sell everything and become and make a

1390
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:47.351
ton of money?

1391
00:38:47.351 --> 00:38:49.210
These storage companies,

1392
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:49.601
well,

1393
00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:53.140
I'm pretty sure that it's 100% horseshit.

1394
00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:53.830
Well,

1395
00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:54.730
if that does happen though,

1396
00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:58.630
they do have auctions at storage and watching those shows,

1397
00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.640
they are not taking any chances.

1398
00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:00.941
Right.

1399
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:02.380
As to whether or not they find shit.

1400
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:04.200
They just pretend to fly and shit.

1401
00:39:04.201 --> 00:39:05.620
Are you sure that that's a fake show?

1402
00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:10.720
<v 1>I'm almost positive that a good percentage of all reality TV is fuckery.</v>

1403
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.520
That what you're seeing is overproduced fuckery.

1404
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:17.900
That's why when you watch it,

1405
00:39:17.901 --> 00:39:19.910
it's real obvious when you watch.

1406
00:39:19.911 --> 00:39:20.870
Like I watch,

1407
00:39:20.871 --> 00:39:25.730
I told you I watched a whole episode of Jersey shore where the whole episode was

1408
00:39:25.731 --> 00:39:26.564
about,

1409
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:27.530
well that's fake.

1410
00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.280
Yeah.

1411
00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.200
One Dude wanting to leave the situation,

1412
00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:31.034
wanted to leave.

1413
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:32.390
Snookie want to stay.

1414
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.710
That's the whole episode.

1415
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:35.830
The situations like C'mon,

1416
00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.340
let's get outta here and stuff.

1417
00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:37.701
He's like,

1418
00:39:37.701 --> 00:39:37.941
Yo,

1419
00:39:37.941 --> 00:39:39.050
he wanted to fucking leave.

1420
00:39:39.051 --> 00:39:40.580
Fuck him and these are,

1421
00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:40.951
come on,

1422
00:39:40.951 --> 00:39:41.784
I gotta get Outta here.

1423
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:46.190
Like there was the whole episode and you know that they like they can cock these

1424
00:39:46.191 --> 00:39:47.060
fucking things.

1425
00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.420
I mean they decide that there's going to be some sort of an issue.

1426
00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:50.871
Okay,

1427
00:39:50.871 --> 00:39:51.531
here's the issue.

1428
00:39:51.531 --> 00:39:52.364
Ready Go.

1429
00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:52.731
When,

1430
00:39:52.731 --> 00:39:53.210
when,

1431
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:53.661
when,

1432
00:39:53.661 --> 00:39:54.260
uh,

1433
00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.690
they were trying to do mining store,

1434
00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.020
that was one of the reasons why Dunkin didn't want to be involved cause like it

1435
00:40:00.021 --> 00:40:01.760
was going to be orchestrated.

1436
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:03.130
Like they were going to have like,

1437
00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.730
this is what it's going to happen.

1438
00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.770
You're going to go looking for some Mexican food.

1439
00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:07.491
You can't find it.

1440
00:40:07.491 --> 00:40:08.840
You look for some Chinese food,

1441
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:10.130
it doesn't look good,

1442
00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:15.050
and you go and finally you get to sell on this and like they had like a script

1443
00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.190
and they worked it out.

1444
00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.020
It's like it's a sketch.

1445
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:23.050
It's just to see really bad sketch with no creativity instead of,

1446
00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.710
it's not reality.

1447
00:40:24.711 --> 00:40:24.981
You know,

1448
00:40:24.981 --> 00:40:26.060
like following guy around.

1449
00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:30.590
It's like a sketch about someone finding an old record player and a storage

1450
00:40:30.591 --> 00:40:31.424
container.

1451
00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.290
All my goodness is this.

1452
00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:34.700
This could be worth a lot of money.

1453
00:40:34.701 --> 00:40:35.211
We bitch.

1454
00:40:35.211 --> 00:40:36.410
You know exactly what that's worth.

1455
00:40:36.411 --> 00:40:36.981
You put it there.

1456
00:40:36.981 --> 00:40:37.814
You're fucked.

1457
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:38.870
That's what you're watching.

1458
00:40:38.871 --> 00:40:40.820
You're watching shitty sketched TV.

1459
00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.750
<v 3>Why wouldn't they just do real one</v>

1460
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.350
<v 1>then?</v>

1461
00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:46.680
Because it's more fun for them to be able to orchestrate it.

1462
00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:48.480
But even the fake ones would be crazy.

1463
00:40:48.481 --> 00:40:52.350
I'm sure they're finding bodies and sometimes sometimes you don't find anything.

1464
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.870
Sometimes you find a bag of newspapers.

1465
00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.010
Then what the fuck do you do?

1466
00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:58.590
Sometimes you find a guy who collected newspaper.

1467
00:40:58.860 --> 00:40:59.521
Oh Great.

1468
00:40:59.521 --> 00:41:04.140
He's got 100,000 issues of the New York Times here every day for the last fifth.

1469
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:05.933
What the fuck?

1470
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.880
You'd be so bored if,

1471
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.100
I bet you got to go through a lot of storage containers for you.

1472
00:41:11.101 --> 00:41:14.310
Find something wacky so you can't just keep filming and you can't keep buying

1473
00:41:14.311 --> 00:41:15.720
these things and either Kinky,

1474
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:16.680
rolling the dice,

1475
00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:18.720
you might go into one and there's nothing in there.

1476
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:22.830
So I think if I know the way the studio's thank you know they,

1477
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:24.380
they want to maximize their cash though.

1478
00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:24.960
Listen,

1479
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.141
this,

1480
00:41:25.141 --> 00:41:25.651
is there any,

1481
00:41:25.651 --> 00:41:28.560
is anyone opposed US fucking leaving a body here.

1482
00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:29.610
Let's just leave out of here.

1483
00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.900
They'll go get a fake body.

1484
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:33.530
They'll put a body at and then let's say we found body,

1485
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.270
<v 3>the one of the fucking line,</v>

1486
00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.560
the one guy on the show,

1487
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.401
I forget his name,

1488
00:41:38.401 --> 00:41:40.950
but he just goes the whole time.

1489
00:41:40.951 --> 00:41:41.580
He just cause Yup.

1490
00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.700
And he has like wears hats that say up on it and shirts and his car.

1491
00:41:44.701 --> 00:41:45.750
So that's up on it.

1492
00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.350
This thing.

1493
00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:46.511
Yeah,

1494
00:41:46.511 --> 00:41:47.344
that's his thing.

1495
00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:48.323
Trademark.

1496
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:49.081
Oh my God.

1497
00:41:49.081 --> 00:41:49.750
He trademark.

1498
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:50.370
Yup.

1499
00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:52.350
Somebody should drop our media in his head.

1500
00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.770
How do you trademark?

1501
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:54.240
Yep.

1502
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.140
Is that even possible?

1503
00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:55.521
Well,

1504
00:41:55.521 --> 00:41:56.354
I think you have to,

1505
00:41:56.430 --> 00:42:00.270
it has to be like his belt is why you uup or something like that.

1506
00:42:00.271 --> 00:42:01.150
So it's more of like a,

1507
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:02.580
it's not a real word or sentence

1508
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:03.493
<v 1>gross.</v>

1509
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.420
I can't even watch that show.

1510
00:42:05.421 --> 00:42:06.680
I've only watched it a couple times,

1511
00:42:06.681 --> 00:42:08.150
but one of the guys who left didn't,

1512
00:42:08.151 --> 00:42:09.100
one of the guys who left side,

1513
00:42:09.101 --> 00:42:10.190
I'd say it was all bullshit.

1514
00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.120
There was all staged.

1515
00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.140
<v 3>It was the second guy that,</v>

1516
00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:14.541
yup.

1517
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:15.050
Guy.

1518
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:15.620
Oh really?

1519
00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.520
He said it was all staged.

1520
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:17.270
Oh Wow.

1521
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.511
Yeah.

1522
00:42:17.511 --> 00:42:18.560
I might not listen to him,

1523
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:20.060
but I ain't think I know.

1524
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:20.750
Maybe.

1525
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:21.950
Maybe it's just a drama queen.

1526
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.431
Yeah.

1527
00:42:22.431 --> 00:42:22.800
Maybe it'll

1528
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.760
<v 1>lying bitch and he's just trying to ruin the whole show.</v>

1529
00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:25.930
Maybe I'm wrong.

1530
00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:28.360
Maybe big foot hunters are really looking for bigfoot.

1531
00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:31.840
Finding bigfoot.

1532
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:32.800
Yeah.

1533
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.633
They keep,

1534
00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.680
they keep doing the same show over and over again.

1535
00:42:35.681 --> 00:42:36.730
They have to find something.

1536
00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.100
Did you ask Tyson about bigfoot?

1537
00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:39.070
Uh,

1538
00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:43.270
do not know because that would be weird to see if him would,

1539
00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:47.410
I wanted to ask him about space stuff also because that's his specialty.

1540
00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:48.011
But,

1541
00:42:48.011 --> 00:42:48.760
um,

1542
00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.001
yeah,

1543
00:42:49.001 --> 00:42:52.060
I would like to see his take the rhythm really fascinating.

1544
00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.053
Uh,

1545
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.680
uh,

1546
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.140
professional take on it is the Jane Goodall take.

1547
00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.360
That one really sways me because,

1548
00:42:58.361 --> 00:42:59.020
uh,

1549
00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:04.020
obviously I'm no scholar of primatology and I don't really know that much about

1550
00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.230
apes.

1551
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.660
I just know what I've read and documentaries and stuff,

1552
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.340
but I've never liked formally studied it.

1553
00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.020
So when someone like Jane Goodall,

1554
00:43:11.021 --> 00:43:12.850
who when I was in high school,

1555
00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:13.631
you know,

1556
00:43:13.631 --> 00:43:16.720
we watched documentaries in class.

1557
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:17.770
That was,

1558
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:22.780
it was a Jane Goodall documentary and we read books about Jane Goodall and when

1559
00:43:22.961 --> 00:43:24.040
she says that she,

1560
00:43:24.041 --> 00:43:27.820
sure there's a undiscovered primate living in the Pacific northwest,

1561
00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:29.201
I go,

1562
00:43:29.201 --> 00:43:30.034
damn,

1563
00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.770
when she says that she believes in the Yeti as well.

1564
00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:34.870
She thinks it's probably the same animal.

1565
00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:35.191
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1566
00:43:35.191 --> 00:43:35.701
But maybe,

1567
00:43:35.701 --> 00:43:36.061
you know,

1568
00:43:36.061 --> 00:43:40.500
she's getting older in her age and she picked a soul that she,

1569
00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:44.880
this is the journey.

1570
00:43:44.881 --> 00:43:45.810
She heck yeah.

1571
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:46.391
<v 1>Boy,</v>

1572
00:43:46.391 --> 00:43:50.960
I got more tweets about Melissa Etheridge and the most athletes podcast and any

1573
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.480
podcasts or recent seven,

1574
00:43:52.481 --> 00:43:53.314
Neil Tyson,

1575
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.350
but people were either going nuts and loved it or they were like,

1576
00:43:57.351 --> 00:44:00.230
God Damn Melissa Etheridge is off her rocker.

1577
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:01.613
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1578
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.011
well,

1579
00:44:02.011 --> 00:44:04.590
I mean half the time I was totally on board though.

1580
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.280
You know,

1581
00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.920
it was just that once in a while where something came out that was like,

1582
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:08.140
Ooh,

1583
00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:08.973
Yay.

1584
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.471
<v 1>Well,</v>

1585
00:44:09.471 --> 00:44:10.304
you know what?

1586
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.390
Her point of view,

1587
00:44:12.391 --> 00:44:14.540
it was really fascinating because like I said,

1588
00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:14.880
it's,

1589
00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:15.381
it's like a,

1590
00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:16.730
almost like a religious point of view.

1591
00:44:16.731 --> 00:44:19.370
It's like you're empowering yourself with this.

1592
00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:20.690
It's way,

1593
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:22.040
way of looking at the world,

1594
00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:23.293
but it's like,

1595
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:24.743
oh,

1596
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:25.693
I dunno.

1597
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:27.290
It's,

1598
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:31.620
it's a tricky thing to think that you're creating your entire world and that

1599
00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:31.810
you,

1600
00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:34.080
you're controlling your own destiny like that.

1601
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.213
It's very weird,

1602
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:40.050
weird to not recognize that there's a lot of interactions and to ignore all of

1603
00:44:40.051 --> 00:44:40.500
them.

1604
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.380
Like if you see all the interactions like on a street corner,

1605
00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:48.510
just see people walking across the street and see cars stopping and not stopping

1606
00:44:48.511 --> 00:44:52.650
and people texting and people not realizing that the light has turned green.

1607
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.200
You see all that randomness.

1608
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:59.100
You see people like on their phone with their hand up to their head and they

1609
00:44:59.101 --> 00:45:02.490
don't see a car that's merging to the right hand side because their head is

1610
00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:03.780
being covered by the phone.

1611
00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:04.370
That's,

1612
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:05.370
that's really common.

1613
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.560
You can control all that.

1614
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:08.221
Okay,

1615
00:45:08.221 --> 00:45:09.270
and if you're there,

1616
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:13.260
you're telling me that you that you were safe,

1617
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:15.000
you're going to be okay because you haven't,

1618
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:19.140
you haven't arranged to have this happened in your existence.

1619
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:20.243
I say,

1620
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:21.083
wow.

1621
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:21.811
I say,

1622
00:45:21.811 --> 00:45:22.644
wow.

1623
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:23.311
I say,

1624
00:45:23.311 --> 00:45:24.060
maybe though,

1625
00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:24.510
Shit,

1626
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:25.021
I don't know.

1627
00:45:25.021 --> 00:45:26.470
She might be right you,

1628
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:27.210
I mean,

1629
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:32.210
what a strange thing it would be if we found out that all this time we,

1630
00:45:32.851 --> 00:45:36.390
what we were really lacking was just confidence and understanding of our

1631
00:45:36.391 --> 00:45:41.391
capabilities and that you really can completely manifest your own reality with

1632
00:45:42.691 --> 00:45:44.410
your mind and that you,

1633
00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.320
your whole world that you live in,

1634
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.150
you can orchestrate with your mind.

1635
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:49.170
Wow.

1636
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:49.490
That,

1637
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:50.040
I mean,

1638
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:50.731
in the future,

1639
00:45:50.731 --> 00:45:55.731
one day that tone turns out that that's the next evolving capability of human

1640
00:45:56.491 --> 00:45:57.300
beings.

1641
00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.710
And then where they just weren't aware of it,

1642
00:45:58.711 --> 00:46:01.740
but some of them made it happen on their own and didn't know why they were doing

1643
00:46:01.741 --> 00:46:02.160
it.

1644
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.500
And then the other ones made their life a complete and total mass.

1645
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.540
But it was all essentially their own choice,

1646
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:07.711
your own choice to do.

1647
00:46:07.711 --> 00:46:08.140
So,

1648
00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:08.580
yeah,

1649
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:09.413
be fascinating.

1650
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:10.643
But it's,

1651
00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:12.243
it's,

1652
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.440
for me personally,

1653
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:15.180
I see why she commits to it.

1654
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:19.530
I see why it would be empowering and I see why it makes her feel like really

1655
00:46:19.531 --> 00:46:20.580
strong and powerful.

1656
00:46:20.581 --> 00:46:21.110
And I,

1657
00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:21.810
I,

1658
00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:23.130
I see all the benefit in it,

1659
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:28.320
but my point of view is always way more.

1660
00:46:28.321 --> 00:46:29.370
Who the fuck knows?

1661
00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:30.781
There's way more.

1662
00:46:30.781 --> 00:46:32.190
Who the fuck knows to anything.

1663
00:46:32.191 --> 00:46:37.191
I can't confirm like for sure 100% I don't have anything in front of me that

1664
00:46:37.801 --> 00:46:40.080
tells me that that could be real.

1665
00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:41.570
I don't have anything.

1666
00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:42.240
It might be,

1667
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.980
I mean it's one of those the possible scenarios the imagination could conjure

1668
00:46:46.981 --> 00:46:47.490
up,

1669
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:51.690
you could conjure up a million different scenarios as to why you're here,

1670
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.930
why you're built like you are while you have the interest you have.

1671
00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:00.140
You can come up with a million different combinations of hypothesis as to why

1672
00:47:02.221 --> 00:47:04.770
and what happens in the previous life if there is a previous life,

1673
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:06.660
but you're really just making things up.

1674
00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.273
That's reality.

1675
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:12.390
The really the reality is that you being in another dimension and you're

1676
00:47:12.391 --> 00:47:13.440
choosing this life,

1677
00:47:13.441 --> 00:47:15.300
like you're really just making that up.

1678
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:16.950
I don't know if that might be real.

1679
00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:17.701
It might be real.

1680
00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:19.290
It absolutely might be real.

1681
00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:23.700
<v 3>She almost was borderline talking about being similar simulation theory.</v>

1682
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.331
Meaning like,

1683
00:47:24.331 --> 00:47:25.520
like you chose the player,

1684
00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:26.640
you pick the outfit,

1685
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:26.971
you know,

1686
00:47:26.971 --> 00:47:28.180
and then you went and like,

1687
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.160
like she was almost saying that we played a game,

1688
00:47:30.161 --> 00:47:30.381
we,

1689
00:47:30.381 --> 00:47:30.760
we,

1690
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.600
we made our character and we chose the level that we were going to do,

1691
00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:34.871
where,

1692
00:47:34.871 --> 00:47:37.000
what part of the map we are going to live on.

1693
00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.850
And it was weird if he thought of it that way.

1694
00:47:39.851 --> 00:47:43.120
Like she always almost doing some kind of hippie version of this simulation

1695
00:47:43.121 --> 00:47:43.640
theory.

1696
00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.000
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1697
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.833
very much so.

1698
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:45.590
Yeah.

1699
00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:46.500
I think the,

1700
00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:50.690
the people that believe in the secret and the people that believe in simulation

1701
00:47:50.691 --> 00:47:51.021
theory,

1702
00:47:51.021 --> 00:47:51.201
they,

1703
00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:53.210
there's definitely a crossover there,

1704
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:54.223
right?

1705
00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.380
I mean if you really creating your own reality,

1706
00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:58.041
you know,

1707
00:47:58.041 --> 00:47:58.970
without fuck.

1708
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.960
See that.

1709
00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:04.190
See the problem is reality is so slippery and weird that the idea that we're

1710
00:48:04.191 --> 00:48:05.420
creating our own reality,

1711
00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.250
it doesn't seem that far fetched.

1712
00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:07.880
You know,

1713
00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:11.120
if we found out that this world really is a simulation,

1714
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:15.650
I don't think you would be that much different than it is right now.

1715
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:16.270
Because if,

1716
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:18.620
if we didn't know the world was the simulation,

1717
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:20.163
you,

1718
00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:20.750
you know,

1719
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:21.583
if there was no,

1720
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:26.210
never was even a theory and you just looked at this world and you go,

1721
00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:29.720
well this is this making sense now this world is filled with shit that doesn't

1722
00:48:29.721 --> 00:48:30.554
make sense.

1723
00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:31.011
All the,

1724
00:48:31.011 --> 00:48:31.380
the,

1725
00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:32.000
the,

1726
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000
I mean besides the marijuana laws and sketch sketch artists and court rooms and

1727
00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.680
there's a million fucking things and make no sense as a million things.

1728
00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:47.330
They're stacked up all over the place and then there's a million things that are

1729
00:48:47.331 --> 00:48:51.270
like so beyond our capability of the,

1730
00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:54.770
even the people that are enthusiasts and I'm like when it comes to cell phones

1731
00:48:54.771 --> 00:48:57.140
or when it comes to that Bluetooth device,

1732
00:48:57.141 --> 00:48:59.060
you were talking about the Sonos thing,

1733
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.450
those things who are so outside of our,

1734
00:49:01.451 --> 00:49:04.700
our understanding we like can read that.

1735
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:04.971
Oh,

1736
00:49:04.971 --> 00:49:07.080
Bluetooth is this bandwidth not,

1737
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:07.341
you know,

1738
00:49:07.341 --> 00:49:09.350
one o eight one 11 be with,

1739
00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:09.831
oh,

1740
00:49:09.831 --> 00:49:10.311
okay.

1741
00:49:10.311 --> 00:49:10.830
Yeah.

1742
00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:11.181
All right.

1743
00:49:11.181 --> 00:49:12.170
And it comes through this way.

1744
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:14.270
Do you know how to make that?

1745
00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:14.630
Do,

1746
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:15.950
do you know what you would have to do?

1747
00:49:15.951 --> 00:49:19.760
Do you know what reactions that are causing the interaction between those two

1748
00:49:19.761 --> 00:49:20.240
devices?

1749
00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.280
I have no fucking clue.

1750
00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:27.230
And these things exist right alongside sketch artists.

1751
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:30.320
It's like it's all together like a giant joke.

1752
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:34.850
It's like a joke of a movie and if you were going to make a simulation about the

1753
00:49:34.851 --> 00:49:39.050
wild west of the roaring twenties of the technological error,

1754
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:42.230
it would look exactly like this day in time.

1755
00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.500
So if we really are players in a simulation,

1756
00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.630
it makes a lot of sense.

1757
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:49.230
This the the the,

1758
00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:54.260
the B beyond bizarre nature of this reality that makes a lot of sense of it's

1759
00:49:55.131 --> 00:49:55.964
fake.

1760
00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:58.760
The problem is it sounds retarded.

1761
00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:01.880
You say that you sound like a fucking idiot beside like a Weirdo.

1762
00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:03.020
You sound like a dumb ass.

1763
00:50:03.021 --> 00:50:03.854
You sound like,

1764
00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:09.460
but scientists way smarter than us are the ones who are pro her proposing this.

1765
00:50:11.091 --> 00:50:11.924
It's not us.

1766
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.780
Like I didn't invent the idea of simulation theory.

1767
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:16.370
I became fascinated with it.

1768
00:50:16.371 --> 00:50:17.390
I talk about it all the time,

1769
00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:19.820
but it absolutely never came from my mind.

1770
00:50:19.821 --> 00:50:23.720
It came from me reading something that a scientist wrote about it or I was like,

1771
00:50:23.721 --> 00:50:24.554
what?

1772
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:29.330
That it was not even a thought that I ever even the I the idea that the whole

1773
00:50:29.331 --> 00:50:32.330
world is like some sort of massive computer program.

1774
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:33.343
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1775
00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:34.940
it's craziness.

1776
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.530
And this course is Joe.

1777
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:37.940
Did you see this?

1778
00:50:37.941 --> 00:50:38.750
Uh,

1779
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:40.130
this video right here yet?

1780
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.200
It's a community access channel show.

1781
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:45.561
I,

1782
00:50:45.561 --> 00:50:49.580
it's a guy that wants to be like one of those guys that go on like the tonight

1783
00:50:49.581 --> 00:50:50.630
show and brings the animals,

1784
00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:51.101
you know?

1785
00:50:51.101 --> 00:50:51.580
No,

1786
00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.413
but this is like,

1787
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.570
like did amateur,

1788
00:50:53.571 --> 00:50:56.540
like this is the open mic of being one of those guys that this guy is the

1789
00:50:56.541 --> 00:50:58.010
biggest idiot in the world.

1790
00:50:58.011 --> 00:50:58.560
He just,

1791
00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:58.971
what he does,

1792
00:50:58.971 --> 00:51:03.230
he has a table and he puts a ton of animals on there and he mixes animals

1793
00:51:03.231 --> 00:51:06.590
together that are not supposed to be together like cats and birds.

1794
00:51:06.591 --> 00:51:07.424
Come on like,

1795
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.970
check this,

1796
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:08.631
check this out.

1797
00:51:08.631 --> 00:51:09.110
How old were you?

1798
00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:09.310
<v 5>Okay,</v>

1799
00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:10.143
come on.

1800
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.990
That's one of my favorite ones.

1801
00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.040
A monkey and a bird.

1802
00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:15.240
Just think they taste good too.

1803
00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.180
Now when he's showing on my finger like this,

1804
00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:22.080
what I do is I tell him no and I poke my finger down his throat like that.

1805
00:51:22.081 --> 00:51:23.610
He gags and then he stops.

1806
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:24.271
Okay,

1807
00:51:24.271 --> 00:51:25.380
now we let them do it again.

1808
00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:26.690
It's important to do this little while.

1809
00:51:26.691 --> 00:51:28.230
His teeth is small and he can't hurt me.

1810
00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.310
We tell them no.

1811
00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:30.293
Poke your finger down there.

1812
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:31.910
<v 1>Rick Ross is here.</v>

1813
00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:33.870
<v 5>Let's talk about that is here.</v>

1814
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.590
Yeah,

1815
00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:35.423
bird feathers.

1816
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:36.250
I've wanted to write.

1817
00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:36.961
He's here to take care of.

1818
00:51:36.961 --> 00:51:38.310
As long as they have the right diet,

1819
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:41.350
we're better off to just kicking away through north.

1820
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:42.283
It's possible.

1821
00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.160
Have nothing to grip again,

1822
00:51:44.161 --> 00:51:45.940
so they're going to grow a lot faster than all.

1823
00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.090
The other thing I was getting on the floor.

1824
00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:49.650
Well,

1825
00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:50.270
oops,

1826
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:51.340
a puppy round.

1827
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:53.220
Other puppy.

1828
00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:55.160
It's important that you really work hard.

1829
00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:57.090
It's fair it on the floor.

1830
00:51:57.091 --> 00:52:00.270
Now it's important that you really work hard in obedience training.

1831
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:00.421
Oh,

1832
00:52:00.421 --> 00:52:00.871
excuse me,

1833
00:52:00.871 --> 00:52:01.490
Bonnie.

1834
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:03.780
All right off you have now this kid never saw a dog before,

1835
00:52:03.781 --> 00:52:04.614
so he's scared.

1836
00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:05.190
Okay,

1837
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.411
okay.

1838
00:52:05.411 --> 00:52:06.630
Is the first time he's been here.

1839
00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.550
Now if you hold the kitten

1840
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:10.580
<v 0>up where they're always go,</v>

1841
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:10.751
no,

1842
00:52:10.751 --> 00:52:12.300
they chose to go inside.

1843
00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.880
Hospitals don't get a lot going to even appreciate it.

1844
00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:17.973
Mary,

1845
00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:18.880
what does it,

1846
00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:19.900
if they want to go the back,

1847
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.761
it's under.

1848
00:52:21.761 --> 00:52:22.700
It's on live leak.

1849
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:23.830
It's just what the fuck.

1850
00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.590
This shirt isn't animal planet.

1851
00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:27.040
It starts off.

1852
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.050
It ends with like dogs and turtles.

1853
00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:30.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1854
00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.193
Shut the shit off.

1855
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.420
See what happens when you're not here.

1856
00:52:34.421 --> 00:52:35.254
Rick Ross,

1857
00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:39.410
motherfuckers playing turtles are wrestling with cats and all kinds of man.

1858
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:40.300
I apologize.

1859
00:52:40.301 --> 00:52:41.140
No worries man.

1860
00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:42.010
No worries.

1861
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:43.480
They told me don't leave.

1862
00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.673
Oh really?

1863
00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:45.643
W This,

1864
00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:47.080
but ladies and gentlemen,

1865
00:52:47.081 --> 00:52:47.980
what we said before,

1866
00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:49.960
if you don't know who Rick is,

1867
00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:54.250
Rick is at one time inspiring tennis player in Los Angeles.

1868
00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:59.280
That was a young man that didn't have even the ability to read and became a

1869
00:53:00.581 --> 00:53:02.440
gigantic cocaine.

1870
00:53:02.441 --> 00:53:04.660
Kingpin wound up going to jail,

1871
00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:05.560
learn how to read.

1872
00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:07.750
Little became studied the law,

1873
00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.190

1874
00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:14.340
got out of jail because of and found out that there's a dude using his name

1875
00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:17.440
who's wrapper and it's the craziest thing ever.

1876
00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:18.040
His name.

1877
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:18.701
You mean if you,

1878
00:53:18.701 --> 00:53:19.990
if you know rapping,

1879
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.983

1881
00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:22.331
oh shit.

1882
00:53:22.331 --> 00:53:25.860
Rick Ross is going to be on the Joe Rogan podcast and they tune in and go,

1883
00:53:25.861 --> 00:53:26.010
who

1884
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.060
<v 6>the fuck is this guy?</v>

1885
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:30.063
Hey,

1886
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:32.190
people stop me on the street all the time.

1887
00:53:32.191 --> 00:53:32.551
See Man,

1888
00:53:32.551 --> 00:53:33.630
I saw you on Joe Rogan.

1889
00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:36.750
MEDVEC hazy to me.

1890
00:53:36.751 --> 00:53:37.584
Show you to see it.

1891
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:39.330
You put me in the tee shirt business.

1892
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:41.230
What is it?

1893
00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:42.330
What is the real,

1894
00:53:42.331 --> 00:53:44.040
Rick Ross got a rapper by the way.

1895
00:53:44.041 --> 00:53:44.910
I dude came to my,

1896
00:53:44.911 --> 00:53:45.990
one of my Chicago shows.

1897
00:53:45.991 --> 00:53:46.890
He had one of those.

1898
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:48.240
Hey,

1899
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.290
this your work man.

1900
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.681
Oh,

1901
00:53:49.681 --> 00:53:50.550
that's beautiful.

1902
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.350
The real Rick Ross is not a rapper.

1903
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:55.540
You don't what got me in a tee shirt?

1904
00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:56.400
Well,

1905
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:56.941
I'm going to wear it.

1906
00:53:56.941 --> 00:53:58.140
I'll wear it with honors.

1907
00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.990
I bought you to here.

1908
00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:01.260
Beautiful.

1909
00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:02.093
Thank you.

1910
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:02.690
Yeah.

1911
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:02.911
Yeah.

1912
00:54:02.911 --> 00:54:03.840
I wanted to thank you man,

1913
00:54:03.841 --> 00:54:05.250
for putting me up on that game.

1914
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:06.510
If people want to buy them,

1915
00:54:06.511 --> 00:54:07.344
where can they get them?

1916
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.940
Or they can go to a freeway.

1917
00:54:08.941 --> 00:54:11.310
So social media.com freeway,

1918
00:54:11.311 --> 00:54:12.630
social media.com there.

1919
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:14.760
You're going to get hit with an avalanche right now.

1920
00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:16.680
You think they're going to support me?

1921
00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:19.240
I support the fuck are you man?

1922
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:23.040
What the fuck are you going to get hit with an avalanche of orders?

1923
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.030
You make that shirt look good man.

1924
00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:28.500
So one more time the website or they didn't write it down.

1925
00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:29.031
Freeway,

1926
00:54:29.031 --> 00:54:30.840
social media.com freeway,

1927
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:33.660
social media.com and get yourself to real.

1928
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:35.160
Rick Ross is not a rapper,

1929
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:35.461
man.

1930
00:54:35.461 --> 00:54:38.520
You see the new business that Joe Rogan put me in?

1931
00:54:38.521 --> 00:54:39.181
You know what I'm saying?

1932
00:54:39.181 --> 00:54:39.481
Now,

1933
00:54:39.481 --> 00:54:40.980
not only am I selling tee shirts,

1934
00:54:40.981 --> 00:54:42.120
I started off selling tee shirts,

1935
00:54:42.121 --> 00:54:44.130
but now manufacturing them,

1936
00:54:44.131 --> 00:54:45.330
I'm putting them together and everything.

1937
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:45.481
Oh,

1938
00:54:45.481 --> 00:54:46.170
that's beautiful.

1939
00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:47.430
You gave me a whole new career.

1940
00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:48.710
What's a great career too?

1941
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.740
Because you know what,

1942
00:54:49.741 --> 00:54:49.981
man,

1943
00:54:49.981 --> 00:54:51.990
this guy's made a lot of fucking money off you.

1944
00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:54.510
You should make a lot of money off you too.

1945
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:55.403
I hope so.

1946
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:56.610
This is the way to do it.

1947
00:54:56.611 --> 00:54:57.210
To to,

1948
00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:57.541
you know,

1949
00:54:57.541 --> 00:54:59.610
to explain like what the fuck.

1950
00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.690
It's a crazy story,

1951
00:55:00.691 --> 00:55:01.100
man.

1952
00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.030
It is a dude running around pretending to be,

1953
00:55:03.031 --> 00:55:05.010
you almost got killed last weekend.

1954
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:05.821
Was that real?

1955
00:55:05.821 --> 00:55:07.830
Because I know 50 cent in him.

1956
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.500
If you don't know the whole gangster rap world,

1957
00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:15.330
this gentleman 50 cent and the fake Rick Ross did not like each other at all.

1958
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:16.193
At all.

1959
00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:17.423
50 set.

1960
00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:18.210
Uh,

1961
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:18.691
who I've mad.

1962
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:19.524
He's very nice guy.

1963
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:22.920
He apparently has been saying the whole thing was stage cause none of the

1964
00:55:22.921 --> 00:55:24.450
bullets hit the car.

1965
00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:25.381
It's amazing.

1966
00:55:25.381 --> 00:55:26.110
That's amazing.

1967
00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:26.450
Yeah.

1968
00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:27.450
I didn't get no car.

1969
00:55:27.451 --> 00:55:29.820
No Ak I heard it was an AK.

1970
00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:30.733
I don't know what it was.

1971
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:31.950
Whoever it was was a horrible,

1972
00:55:31.951 --> 00:55:33.240
she trashed his Rolls Royce.

1973
00:55:33.241 --> 00:55:34.300
So worst shot ever.

1974
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:39.290
If you've got a giant fat dude in front of you in a mercy,

1975
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:40.380
what was a Rolls Royce?

1976
00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.290
Those worries and nice looking roads where it's still,

1977
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:43.253
yeah he didn't,

1978
00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:44.751
I tell you something.

1979
00:55:44.751 --> 00:55:45.584
Makes a lot of stuff.

1980
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:46.463
A lot of sense.

1981
00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:47.191
So you know,

1982
00:55:47.191 --> 00:55:50.160
I've thought about it after he said Dan cause cause I mean I couldn't,

1983
00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:50.691
you know,

1984
00:55:50.691 --> 00:55:52.740
I couldn't just grasp that at first.

1985
00:55:52.741 --> 00:55:53.560
And I'm like,

1986
00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:53.851
I mean,

1987
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:55.410
who would go in in a community and,

1988
00:55:55.411 --> 00:55:58.110
and she can let our 15 rounds just in buildings and,

1989
00:55:58.340 --> 00:55:59.980
and how do you miss the,

1990
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.030
how do you miss 15 times when,

1991
00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:02.371
I mean,

1992
00:56:02.371 --> 00:56:04.350
I guess you can the right circumstances,

1993
00:56:04.351 --> 00:56:06.690
but he's very lucky if he set that up.

1994
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:10.620
If he actually would set something up like that with a real gun and shooting it

1995
00:56:10.621 --> 00:56:12.120
in occupied community.

1996
00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:12.751
I mean,

1997
00:56:12.751 --> 00:56:17.751
he may really wind up being a gangster one day in prison or it could be that

1998
00:56:17.821 --> 00:56:20.610
someone was just trying to scare him and that they weren't trying to kill him.

1999
00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:23.220
They're trying to get them to give money and if he gives him money,

2000
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:23.800
you know,

2001
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.120
you can't give money when you're dead.

2002
00:56:25.121 --> 00:56:26.350
So they don't really want to shoot him.

2003
00:56:26.351 --> 00:56:27.970
What they want to do is scare the shit out of him,

2004
00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:28.570
let him alone.

2005
00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:29.331
And that's when he crashed.

2006
00:56:29.331 --> 00:56:30.190
That's what I thought too.

2007
00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:31.611
That's what I feel.

2008
00:56:31.611 --> 00:56:33.280
And I felt that it was a warning shot.

2009
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:34.061
You know,

2010
00:56:34.061 --> 00:56:35.020
pay what you owe,

2011
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:36.123
uh,

2012
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.110
you know,

2013
00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:38.110
and get on your business.

2014
00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:40.960
And for people don't know that side of the story apparently.

2015
00:56:40.961 --> 00:56:43.420
Like he use someone's name and a rap and there's,

2016
00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.353
uh,

2017
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:48.220
a group of gentlemen that called themselves a gangster disciples and they

2018
00:56:48.221 --> 00:56:51.190
apparently the game a warning once and he did something else.

2019
00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:53.110
I was in jail with some of those guys.

2020
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:53.580
Oh yeah,

2021
00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:54.170
yeah.

2022
00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:54.500
They,

2023
00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:58.240
they don't enjoy his use of their vernacular.

2024
00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:58.991
And uh,

2025
00:56:58.991 --> 00:56:59.321
the,

2026
00:56:59.321 --> 00:57:00.640
the image that you mentioned,

2027
00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:01.770
who would,

2028
00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:06.100
who would want somebody to come represent their thing?

2029
00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.770
Something that you've worked hard for it to put together and then hit this guy

2030
00:57:08.771 --> 00:57:09.110
come in.

2031
00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:10.300
He hasn't paid any dues,

2032
00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.340
but he enjoys all the benefits.

2033
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:15.340
It's a strange case of Americana in my opinion.

2034
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.280
I find it quite fascinating because,

2035
00:57:18.281 --> 00:57:18.820
um,

2036
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:19.450
you know,

2037
00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:21.820
we are in so many ways,

2038
00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:25.130
we're so silly with our culture and a are,

2039
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:30.360
are going way out of the way to pretend to be something that we're not and

2040
00:57:30.911 --> 00:57:32.770
selling an image and you know,

2041
00:57:32.771 --> 00:57:36.100
and portraying an image and his case,

2042
00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:41.130
his story is one of the most fascinating ones that I've ever seen because he's

2043
00:57:43.001 --> 00:57:44.050
making all kinds of histories.

2044
00:57:44.051 --> 00:57:44.480
It's like,

2045
00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.240
remember the CV 40 the Chris Rock?

2046
00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:46.601
Yeah.

2047
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:48.880
It's like an updated version of that.

2048
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:51.700
He's a corrections officer.

2049
00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:53.620
I mean it sounds he's worse to CD four.

2050
00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:55.390
It sounds like you're writing a movie,

2051
00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:55.930
right?

2052
00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:59.710
A corrections officer who's known to be like,

2053
00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:02.650
did he like get like employee of the month and shit?

2054
00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:03.131
Did He,

2055
00:58:03.131 --> 00:58:04.540
did he got award?

2056
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:06.221
Okay.

2057
00:58:06.221 --> 00:58:07.054
So he's like,

2058
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:09.190
you know what you had to do to get award as a,

2059
00:58:09.191 --> 00:58:10.330
as a correction while vision.

2060
00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:11.170
What do you have to do?

2061
00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:12.760
Look at a lot of balls and assholes.

2062
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:16.720
They got to find things.

2063
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:18.103
That would be a job.

2064
00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.990
That would be a job that would suit me,

2065
00:58:19.991 --> 00:58:20.350
right?

2066
00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:22.000
If it was a female facility.

2067
00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:22.893
Oh yeah.

2068
00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:25.370
But what if you pull him dynamite,

2069
00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:26.710
a chick's pussies all day?

2070
00:58:26.711 --> 00:58:28.230
I do want to get a little paranoid,

2071
00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:29.123
be fine,

2072
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:31.630
but at a men's facility,

2073
00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:32.923
uh,

2074
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:33.761
I don't think so.

2075
00:58:33.761 --> 00:58:34.480
Not me.

2076
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.350
I'm going to have to wait.

2077
00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:41.220
So the guy pretends to be this guy with this crazy criminal past of selling

2078
00:58:42.041 --> 00:58:45.190
drugs and he tattoos your name on his hands,

2079
00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:46.571
your name.

2080
00:58:46.571 --> 00:58:48.490
Rick Ross is tattooed on his hands.

2081
00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:50.740
He's got like money tattooed all over and all kinds of,

2082
00:58:50.741 --> 00:58:51.551
all the crazy shit.

2083
00:58:51.551 --> 00:58:52.480
It's really interesting.

2084
00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:57.160
And it just keeps coming out more and more that he gets busted with all this

2085
00:58:57.161 --> 00:58:59.410
bullshit more and more.

2086
00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:02.950
They just did a story on him in her own and was saying that he comes from a

2087
00:59:02.951 --> 00:59:03.940
suburbian area,

2088
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:04.271
you know,

2089
00:59:04.271 --> 00:59:05.530
he's not even from the hood.

2090
00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:06.281
So,

2091
00:59:06.281 --> 00:59:06.920
uh,

2092
00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:07.300
I mean,

2093
00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:07.511
you know,

2094
00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:07.810
just,

2095
00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:09.190
it just doesn't end with this guy.

2096
00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:11.260
And he's making records you though,

2097
00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:12.020
you know?

2098
00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:12.250
Yeah.

2099
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:14.200
He's the first major artists they ever had.

2100
00:59:14.201 --> 00:59:16.630
The council was a concert from death threats.

2101
00:59:16.631 --> 00:59:17.980
You know what's really fucked up though?

2102
00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:21.170
I think he could've done everything he did with a different name.

2103
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:21.980
I really

2104
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.400
<v 1>do.</v>

2105
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.310
I really do really hard work and some hard work.

2106
00:59:25.311 --> 00:59:26.690
Did some hard work.

2107
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:29.360
It's not like you didn't do any hard work at all.

2108
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:31.400
He definitely put out those albums.

2109
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:33.200
He definitely does those shows.

2110
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.520
He's definitely hustling,

2111
00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:34.881
right?

2112
00:59:34.881 --> 00:59:35.120
Yeah.

2113
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.450
So why the fuck did he have to try to do it under your name?

2114
00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:41.960
It's like he showed just as grand weakness as a man,

2115
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:42.381
you know,

2116
00:59:42.381 --> 00:59:43.214
who are you?

2117
00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:44.180
You know,

2118
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:46.310
it's one thing if you invent your name,

2119
00:59:46.311 --> 00:59:47.600
like you want to be Jay z,

2120
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:48.200
you know?

2121
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.300
Or even Jz.

2122
00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:50.780
Supposedly there was a dude named jazz.

2123
00:59:50.781 --> 00:59:50.981
Oh,

2124
00:59:50.981 --> 00:59:51.290
oh.

2125
00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:52.820
That was in his community.

2126
00:59:52.821 --> 00:59:54.980
That was like an older rapper that was really bad ass.

2127
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:56.150
So he showed her like,

2128
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:58.400
Damn Cherokee jet magazine.

2129
00:59:58.401 --> 00:59:58.960
You're doing it.

2130
00:59:58.960 --> 00:59:59.660
How do you know?

2131
00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:00.780
I know shit.

2132
01:00:00.781 --> 01:00:03.920
I got my thumb on the pulse of a part of the hood.

2133
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:06.710
You know Joe connected,

2134
01:00:06.711 --> 01:00:09.500
man Joe is connected.

2135
01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:11.030
I try to pay attention to shit,

2136
01:00:11.031 --> 01:00:11.750
dude.

2137
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:12.411
But I mean,

2138
01:00:12.411 --> 01:00:13.200
it's one thing to,

2139
01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.480
to make your own name,

2140
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.781
you know,

2141
01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:16.220
to call yourself 50 cent or whatever.

2142
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:19.220
But if you get him take another man's name,

2143
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.230
you're dealing with a completely different thing.

2144
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:22.130
Like that's not,

2145
01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.420
you didn't make up a name,

2146
01:00:23.421 --> 01:00:24.490
you're a crazy person.

2147
01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:24.691
<v 7>Well,</v>

2148
01:00:24.691 --> 01:00:24.931
you know,

2149
01:00:24.931 --> 01:00:27.060
the whole thing about being successful,

2150
01:00:27.061 --> 01:00:27.330
I mean,

2151
01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:28.680
I mean the way when I came up,

2152
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:33.390
the whole thing about being for sec successful was to be able to do it yourself.

2153
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.110
Right?

2154
01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:38.880
You know not to where you come and you know somebody just come and they bless

2155
01:00:38.881 --> 01:00:40.350
you with everything that you need and,

2156
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:41.640
and here you are.

2157
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:43.890
You know you're successful now,

2158
01:00:43.891 --> 01:00:44.671
but you didn't earn it.

2159
01:00:44.671 --> 01:00:45.690
You don't know how you did it.

2160
01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.640
Right when I started,

2161
01:00:47.641 --> 01:00:51.960
I wanted to make a name for myself and I felt that what he's doing right now,

2162
01:00:51.961 --> 01:00:53.250
he's making a name for me,

2163
01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:55.000
not for himself.

2164
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.260
<v 1>He's helping you trust me with everybody else's hell people.</v>

2165
01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:00.160
This is all helping you.

2166
01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:01.990
I guarantee you it's way better than that.

2167
01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:02.920
This guy wasn't around,

2168
01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:04.340
this guy wasn't around.

2169
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:05.111
You got to jail.

2170
01:01:05.111 --> 01:01:05.411
It's like,

2171
01:01:05.411 --> 01:01:05.621
well,

2172
01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:06.090
you know,

2173
01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:09.670
sort of life as usual and people are gonna want to listen to your story.

2174
01:01:09.671 --> 01:01:12.220
But now the story becomes Uber crazy.

2175
01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:12.540
Yeah.

2176
01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:13.373
It becomes really sure.

2177
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:14.303
Cause it's not like,

2178
01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:14.681
you know,

2179
01:01:14.681 --> 01:01:14.891
there's,

2180
01:01:14.891 --> 01:01:18.190
there's a lot of dudes like gangster rappers especially,

2181
01:01:18.191 --> 01:01:18.490
they'll,

2182
01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:20.140
they'll sort of have like a tribute name,

2183
01:01:20.141 --> 01:01:20.891
like the call himself,

2184
01:01:20.891 --> 01:01:22.300
something Gambino or,

2185
01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:23.163
you know what I mean?

2186
01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:25.000
But they won't use the whole name,

2187
01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:25.931
you know,

2188
01:01:25.931 --> 01:01:26.501
they won't say,

2189
01:01:26.501 --> 01:01:27.370
I'm Al Capone.

2190
01:01:27.371 --> 01:01:27.660
Like,

2191
01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:28.061
come on.

2192
01:01:28.061 --> 01:01:28.691
You can't say,

2193
01:01:28.691 --> 01:01:29.350
you know,

2194
01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:31.090
when you say you're Rick Ross,

2195
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:32.440
he did that.

2196
01:01:32.441 --> 01:01:34.630
I think thinking you would never come out of jail.

2197
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:34.971
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

2198
01:01:34.971 --> 01:01:35.271
Yeah.

2199
01:01:35.271 --> 01:01:37.340
I don't think that they thought I would ever get out.

2200
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:38.203
Um,

2201
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:38.640
in,

2202
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.050
in,

2203
01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:39.321
you know,

2204
01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:39.861
it was vacant.

2205
01:01:39.861 --> 01:01:41.070
They felt it was a vacant house.

2206
01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.440
<v 1>Why the House move in?</v>

2207
01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:43.750
Yeah.

2208
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:45.540
Because it was really like a squatter.

2209
01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.071
Yeah.

2210
01:01:46.071 --> 01:01:46.290
You know,

2211
01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:49.440
he was the squatters and he squatted on my name and it's all your,

2212
01:01:49.450 --> 01:01:51.900
your reality happened before the Internet.

2213
01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:52.440
You're,

2214
01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:52.900
you're the,

2215
01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.420
the craziness of your,

2216
01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:54.691
you know,

2217
01:01:54.691 --> 01:01:55.770
you're selling drugs.

2218
01:01:55.870 --> 01:02:00.360
You're basically being one of the biggest drug dealers the country has ever

2219
01:02:00.361 --> 01:02:01.020
known.

2220
01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:01.920
Like all that happened,

2221
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:02.783
pre-internet,

2222
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.810
it happened today.

2223
01:02:03.811 --> 01:02:05.400
He would never be able to use that name.

2224
01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:05.701
<v 7>Oh,</v>

2225
01:02:05.701 --> 01:02:05.971
no,

2226
01:02:05.971 --> 01:02:06.181
no,

2227
01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:06.421
no,

2228
01:02:06.421 --> 01:02:06.661
no,

2229
01:02:06.661 --> 01:02:07.171
absolutely.

2230
01:02:07.171 --> 01:02:07.800
Yeah.

2231
01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.521
But you know,

2232
01:02:08.521 --> 01:02:09.354
I mean,

2233
01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.350
it is what it is.

2234
01:02:10.351 --> 01:02:10.820
Joe [inaudible]

2235
01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:13.000
<v 1>Fascinating Hee Hee Hee Hee Hee,</v>

2236
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:13.600
Hee Hee

2237
01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.433
<v 7>got it.</v>

2238
01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:15.211
You know what I'm saying?

2239
01:02:15.211 --> 01:02:15.370
And,

2240
01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:16.920
and now he has a name and,

2241
01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:20.040
and what I want right now is just for to stop using it

2242
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:22.740
<v 6>and then pay me a little my dividends that,</v>

2243
01:02:22.741 --> 01:02:23.241
you know,

2244
01:02:23.241 --> 01:02:24.400
what I made from using my name.

2245
01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:25.170
I'll tell you this,

2246
01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:26.003
kickback in,

2247
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:29.920
he's never gonna stop using it and he's not that hard.

2248
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:35.040
Why won't it tattooed where he can get us,

2249
01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.810
they remove tats.

2250
01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:40.980
But once it's added to a man's name on your fucking hands,

2251
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.630
you got me and you gotta fight.

2252
01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:43.493
You gotta fight it.

2253
01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:48.190
He was in love with you for sure.

2254
01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:49.960
That has gotta be crazy.

2255
01:02:49.961 --> 01:02:50.351
Every time he,

2256
01:02:50.351 --> 01:02:51.720
Jack's office sees your name on it,

2257
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.711
that's crazy.

2258
01:02:53.711 --> 01:02:54.700
He's brushing his teeth.

2259
01:02:54.701 --> 01:02:58.870
He sees your name on his hands and he knows how you feel about it too.

2260
01:02:58.930 --> 01:02:59.261
You know,

2261
01:02:59.261 --> 01:02:59.431
it's,

2262
01:02:59.431 --> 01:03:00.041
it's not like,

2263
01:03:00.041 --> 01:03:00.430
you know,

2264
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:03.120
you're like some dude who's like living to bet and you know,

2265
01:03:03.121 --> 01:03:04.030
hiding in a village.

2266
01:03:04.031 --> 01:03:05.200
She doesn't have to have contact with,

2267
01:03:05.201 --> 01:03:05.861
you know,

2268
01:03:05.861 --> 01:03:06.641
I'm out there,

2269
01:03:06.641 --> 01:03:07.420
you know,

2270
01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:08.170
grinding.

2271
01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:08.951
I believe.

2272
01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.600
Truly believe it's a gift.

2273
01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.613
I really do.

2274
01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.030
I think the whole thing is a gift.

2275
01:03:13.031 --> 01:03:14.680
He's a ridiculous human being.

2276
01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.393
God,

2277
01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:17.890
everything you told me to do,

2278
01:03:17.891 --> 01:03:18.321
so boy,

2279
01:03:18.321 --> 01:03:19.210
you was right about it.

2280
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:19.680
I'm,

2281
01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:19.870
I'm,

2282
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:20.441
I'm an idiot.

2283
01:03:20.441 --> 01:03:21.131
Savant man.

2284
01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:21.964
Trust me on this.

2285
01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:22.630
The,

2286
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:26.080
I think that he's him being so ridiculous.

2287
01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:27.610
He's a preposterous human being.

2288
01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:28.720
He's obese.

2289
01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.820
He's covered in tattoos.

2290
01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:32.710
He's a fake rapper.

2291
01:03:32.711 --> 01:03:33.940
Who was at one point in time,

2292
01:03:33.941 --> 01:03:36.130
a corrections officer for that guy to take your name.

2293
01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:37.240
It's glorious.

2294
01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:37.600
Yeah.

2295
01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.351
It's like you couldn't,

2296
01:03:38.351 --> 01:03:40.040
if anybody couldn't ask for anything better,

2297
01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.120
I couldn't ask for a better candidate because when they investigated they go

2298
01:03:43.121 --> 01:03:43.951
check this one of the fun.

2299
01:03:43.951 --> 01:03:44.784
Right.

2300
01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.420
And here's what's even better.

2301
01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:48.010
He's actually talented.

2302
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:50.380
So a lot of people are going to hear about them.

2303
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:50.770
Yeah.

2304
01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:52.420
So a lot of people are going to hear his name.

2305
01:03:52.421 --> 01:03:54.040
A lot of people going to hear the story.

2306
01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:55.840
So He's a gift to you.

2307
01:03:55.930 --> 01:03:56.763
He really is.

2308
01:03:56.830 --> 01:04:01.830
This guy is the greatest PR representative you could have ever hired by far.

2309
01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:06.910
No one could ever reach as many people and somehow under the give the seeds of

2310
01:04:06.911 --> 01:04:09.160
your story as this guy pretending to be.

2311
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:09.760
You know what?

2312
01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:10.660
I got a guy.

2313
01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:12.520
He wants to meet you.

2314
01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:13.300
Yeah.

2315
01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:15.940
He may be able to reach more guys in and then that guy,

2316
01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:16.451
he's,

2317
01:04:16.451 --> 01:04:17.440
he's uh,

2318
01:04:17.650 --> 01:04:18.940
he's the world's greatest spammer.

2319
01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.010
The world's greatest spammer.

2320
01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:21.191
Yeah.

2321
01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.750
His name is Bill Wagner.

2322
01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:24.340
I don't think I would want to be in the room with that dude.

2323
01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:27.200
What we get in a fight with them that was fuck,

2324
01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.053
I'm the shit.

2325
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:29.950
No bill to get your email.

2326
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:31.460
And he said did,

2327
01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:32.290
he does,

2328
01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:34.200
he does have like a little following.

2329
01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.260
He doesn't know who they are.

2330
01:04:35.261 --> 01:04:36.040
Right.

2331
01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:39.730
But he says every time he goes on to show if somebody calls in and bad mouth

2332
01:04:39.731 --> 01:04:40.440
him,

2333
01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.640
what are these guys going again?

2334
01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:44.230
So really instead of like a thousand pizzas.

2335
01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.130
<v 2>Okay,</v>

2336
01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:47.963
<v 6>that's fine.</v>

2337
01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.590
But there'll be a wants to meet you,

2338
01:04:49.591 --> 01:04:49.901
man.

2339
01:04:49.901 --> 01:04:50.190
Okay,

2340
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:51.060
well we'll hook it up.

2341
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:52.140
They have this,

2342
01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.160
this guy though.

2343
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.700
What?

2344
01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:54.620
I'm going back to the,

2345
01:04:54.621 --> 01:04:55.590
the fake Rick Ross,

2346
01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:57.830
his him as a publicist,

2347
01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:00.410
like if you hired him to get your name in Korea,

2348
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:00.950
fortunate,

2349
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:01.111
you know,

2350
01:05:01.111 --> 01:05:05.430
how much money it would cost to just to get as much attention as it's got.

2351
01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:09.180
The fact that he stole your name and the fact that so many people were talking

2352
01:05:09.181 --> 01:05:09.451
about it.

2353
01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:14.451
I mean that's an incredible story that like I would have to think,

2354
01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:15.331
well,

2355
01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:17.170
I didn't look at it and I didn't look at it like that.

2356
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.090
Millions of people have heard that story now.

2357
01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:22.420
<v 7>You know how I'm more to the point to where you know,</v>

2358
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:23.710
the guy stole my name.

2359
01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:25.840
He didn't have the decency to come and say,

2360
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:26.800
look man,

2361
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.670
I bought your name.

2362
01:05:27.671 --> 01:05:28.430
I'm going to give it back.

2363
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:31.820
<v 6>I'm just trying to change the whole way you look at it because I really believe</v>

2364
01:05:31.821 --> 01:05:33.350
the universe gave you a gift.

2365
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:37.950
You're looking at it like this dude came along and he victimize you and he

2366
01:05:37.951 --> 01:05:39.500
fucked you over and he owes you.

2367
01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.000
And I see that too.

2368
01:05:41.001 --> 01:05:41.631
But I say,

2369
01:05:41.631 --> 01:05:43.340
the universe owes you a gift,

2370
01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:44.540
a gave you a gift.

2371
01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.960
And that gift is you've got an idiot,

2372
01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:53.180
you got a silly person pretending to be you who's super talented.

2373
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:55.250
I mean the guy's really that every day I'm hustling.

2374
01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.480
That's a bad ass song.

2375
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:57.500
That's about our song.

2376
01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:59.390
Even if he stole your,

2377
01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:02.750
like the way you talk about shit and like you said that that was like your quote

2378
01:06:02.810 --> 01:06:03.621
everyday I'm hustling,

2379
01:06:03.621 --> 01:06:03.920
right?

2380
01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:04.280
Yeah.

2381
01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:04.650
Yeah.

2382
01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:05.750
I couldn't put it in a song.

2383
01:06:05.751 --> 01:06:06.110
Anyway,

2384
01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:06.231
he,

2385
01:06:06.231 --> 01:06:07.460
the guy did a great job with it.

2386
01:06:07.461 --> 01:06:09.050
What I'm saying is that,

2387
01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.890
and so so many people will pay attention to him because how good he is now.

2388
01:06:12.891 --> 01:06:17.300
He's a fucking talented God and then on top of that he's got your name tattooed

2389
01:06:17.301 --> 01:06:19.700
on his hands and then it just spills out from there.

2390
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:21.050
It's a beautiful,

2391
01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:21.973
he's like,

2392
01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.690
it's like a Trojan horse.

2393
01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.441
Like he,

2394
01:06:24.441 --> 01:06:28.400
he'll get your story into neighborhoods where it would never ordinarily be.

2395
01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:29.990
If people investigate them,

2396
01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:32.990
all they have to do is Google the real Rick Ross.

2397
01:06:32.991 --> 01:06:33.824
Boom.

2398
01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:37.600
The story pops up within the first two or three paragraphs and everybody's going

2399
01:06:37.601 --> 01:06:37.881
to go,

2400
01:06:37.881 --> 01:06:38.714
what?

2401
01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:40.880
It becomes crazy.

2402
01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:41.661
Yeah.

2403
01:06:41.661 --> 01:06:42.490
I think it's a gift.

2404
01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:43.150
<v 7>I mean a,</v>

2405
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:43.390
uh,

2406
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:45.070
when you look at it from that aspect,

2407
01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:45.320
um,

2408
01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:45.700
I mean,

2409
01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:46.533
I guess you're right.

2410
01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.540
<v 6>You can't lose,</v>

2411
01:06:47.541 --> 01:06:48.374
you're not losing,

2412
01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.060
he can't stop you from using your name.

2413
01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.980
Not your real name is fucking Rick Ross.

2414
01:06:51.981 --> 01:06:52.701
He can't say shit,

2415
01:06:52.701 --> 01:06:53.470
but has a lot of

2416
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.920
<v 7>who's that,</v>

2417
01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.191
you know,

2418
01:06:54.191 --> 01:06:57.160
like say for is I want to go to universal and get a record deal and it's not

2419
01:06:57.161 --> 01:06:57.994
going to happen.

2420
01:06:58.810 --> 01:06:59.231
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2421
01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:00.130
That would be interesting

2422
01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:02.770
<v 7>if I want to go to Warner brothers and get a record deal because he's already</v>

2423
01:07:02.771 --> 01:07:03.604
working with them.

2424
01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:04.240
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2425
01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.470
What would they do if you,

2426
01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:09.100
what if you were just undeniable and you had a gigantic following you the

2427
01:07:09.101 --> 01:07:10.570
baddest fucking rapper on earth,

2428
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:12.370
but your name was also Rick Ross.

2429
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.510
What the fuck would they do?

2430
01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:14.171
Well,

2431
01:07:14.171 --> 01:07:14.470
they do,

2432
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:15.580
you gotta change your name now,

2433
01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:17.440
but you need a stage name.

2434
01:07:17.441 --> 01:07:17.941
Rick Ross.

2435
01:07:17.941 --> 01:07:20.020
He can't be Rick [inaudible] Roberts.

2436
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:24.820
William Roberts is the actual fake Rick Ross's name.

2437
01:07:24.821 --> 01:07:28.540
That's what you should do to change my name and when you were out and see if I

2438
01:07:28.541 --> 01:07:29.270
can make that,

2439
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:30.520
make that a Jack Daniels.

2440
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.460
Roberts is kind of a bad ass ne.

2441
01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:34.450
There's nothing wrong with William Roberts.

2442
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.830
His Dad thought it was pretty good.

2443
01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:36.431
Yeah,

2444
01:07:36.431 --> 01:07:37.264
it's a good name.

2445
01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:39.850
That's a strong name.

2446
01:07:39.851 --> 01:07:41.110
You Know William Roberts.

2447
01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:41.590
That's it.

2448
01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:42.940
There's nothing wrong with that name.

2449
01:07:43.210 --> 01:07:43.601
You know,

2450
01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:44.434
it's not,

2451
01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:44.801
look,

2452
01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:47.350
Henry Winkler lived his whole life as Henry Winkler.

2453
01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.310
He turned out great.

2454
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:50.920
Henry Winkler can't fuck with that.

2455
01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.140
William Hogg William Gangster too.

2456
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:54.303
It does.

2457
01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:58.480
Sounds like a dude holding a glass of Cognac with a pistol.

2458
01:07:58.481 --> 01:08:00.040
And I'm saying Jack Daniels.

2459
01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.620
Yeah.

2460
01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:04.210
I'm,

2461
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:08.320
I'm fascinated by the most ridiculous aspects of our culture.

2462
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:11.590
One of the most ridiculous aspects of our culture of fakers.

2463
01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:12.341
You know,

2464
01:08:12.341 --> 01:08:13.174
people like,

2465
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.901
you know,

2466
01:08:13.901 --> 01:08:15.980
whether it's a guy who pretends that he was a

2467
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.990
<v 1>navy seal who wasn't and he gets caught.</v>

2468
01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.370
I love reading that Shit,

2469
01:08:19.371 --> 01:08:19.850
man.

2470
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.950
There was a dude that was on this,

2471
01:08:21.951 --> 01:08:22.220
uh,

2472
01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:23.420
mixed martial arts forum.

2473
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:27.260
He was like one of the oldest guys to ever fight in an MMA fight.

2474
01:08:27.261 --> 01:08:32.261
He fight an MMA fight when he was like 60 guy was crazy big yoked up dude at 62

2475
01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:35.030
but apparently it was a big crazy liar too.

2476
01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:37.050
And he like pretended to be like in the,

2477
01:08:37.051 --> 01:08:42.051
in the special forces and pretended to like have a bunch of kills in Vietnam.

2478
01:08:42.111 --> 01:08:44.630
And meanwhile he like worked behind a desk somewhere.

2479
01:08:44.631 --> 01:08:46.070
Like they found it was a total liar,

2480
01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:46.761
just made up the store.

2481
01:08:46.761 --> 01:08:48.710
But he had a whole security company and everything.

2482
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.810
I am fascinated by that shit.

2483
01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:51.951
I'm fascinated.

2484
01:08:51.951 --> 01:08:52.560
I can't,

2485
01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.360
I,

2486
01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.640
when I find fakers fakers to me,

2487
01:08:55.641 --> 01:08:57.440
are there the perplexing,

2488
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.661
<v 7>well,</v>

2489
01:08:57.661 --> 01:09:01.470
I think we breeding a whole culture now fakers I mean,

2490
01:09:01.471 --> 01:09:03.750
when you watch TV with the reality shows,

2491
01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:05.400
it's just so much,

2492
01:09:05.401 --> 01:09:07.320
and I think that could be bad for us,

2493
01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:08.821
for our kids,

2494
01:09:08.821 --> 01:09:09.061
you know,

2495
01:09:09.061 --> 01:09:10.270
for our kids to get that dead,

2496
01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:10.620
dead,

2497
01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.270
dead ideas that,

2498
01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:13.493
you know,

2499
01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:18.180
you can fake it and be successful and really not be successful.

2500
01:09:18.181 --> 01:09:18.510
I mean,

2501
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:19.343
it's kind of,

2502
01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:20.310
I don't know.

2503
01:09:20.310 --> 01:09:20.581
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2504
01:09:20.581 --> 01:09:20.881
We've,

2505
01:09:20.881 --> 01:09:25.860
we've given a whole generation of people the idea that you can become famous for

2506
01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:27.150
having no qualities.

2507
01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:27.770
Yeah,

2508
01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:28.380
exactly.

2509
01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:29.040
Nothing.

2510
01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.330
There's nothing there other than,

2511
01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.021
you know,

2512
01:09:31.021 --> 01:09:32.010
some people want to fuck you.

2513
01:09:32.011 --> 01:09:34.910
I guess he didn't like you.

2514
01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.500
Why you watch one of those Kim Kardashians chosen you.

2515
01:09:38.610 --> 01:09:41.970
You will shut that TV off and just stare at the wall for an hour going,

2516
01:09:41.971 --> 01:09:43.440
what the fuck is going on here?

2517
01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.180
What did I just watch?

2518
01:09:45.210 --> 01:09:47.400
I just watched a dumb girl go shopping.

2519
01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:50.770
I mean this is the craziest shit ever that they made a TV show out of it.

2520
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:51.121
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

2521
01:09:51.121 --> 01:09:53.780
they got some of the craziest stuff on TV now and then and,

2522
01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.680
and most of it's about faking.

2523
01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.900
Know the basketball wives.

2524
01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.900
<v 1>I think that's going to be a backlash though.</v>

2525
01:09:59.901 --> 01:10:01.760
I think one of the things we're dealing with is,

2526
01:10:01.761 --> 01:10:02.211
first of all,

2527
01:10:02.211 --> 01:10:05.240
the fact that TV has really only been around for a couple generations.

2528
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.901
You know,

2529
01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:06.081
the,

2530
01:10:06.081 --> 01:10:06.310
the,

2531
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:07.580
the television,

2532
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:08.780
the reality of it.

2533
01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.960
When did it start in the 50s that's not enough time for us to really get a

2534
01:10:11.961 --> 01:10:15.410
handle of what the fuck it's doing to our culture and then do something about

2535
01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:15.560
it.

2536
01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.770
And whenever there's any sort of a,

2537
01:10:17.771 --> 01:10:20.390
an opportunity to be opportunistic to make some cash.

2538
01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:21.940
The easiest way to make some cash,

2539
01:10:21.941 --> 01:10:26.380
it's just put some stupid people on TV and make them do ridiculous shit that

2540
01:10:26.381 --> 01:10:26.781
people go,

2541
01:10:26.781 --> 01:10:27.920
what the fuck are they doing?

2542
01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:32.540
But you're watching dummy and then they sell you tide in the commercials and

2543
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:33.141
you,

2544
01:10:33.141 --> 01:10:33.551
you know,

2545
01:10:33.551 --> 01:10:34.700
we didn't want to make some money though.

2546
01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:35.870
You don't want smart people on TV.

2547
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:37.130
I don't believe that.

2548
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:38.690
I really think that it's just,

2549
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:40.190
it's not,

2550
01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:42.020
it's not that they don't want smart people on TV.

2551
01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:46.130
It's just that they want a lot of people to watch and it's lazy.

2552
01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.020
But the easy way to get a lot of people to watch,

2553
01:10:48.021 --> 01:10:50.480
it's just put ridiculous shit on like Jersey Shore.

2554
01:10:50.481 --> 01:10:51.261
Like you know,

2555
01:10:51.261 --> 01:10:53.540
just real housewives where you know,

2556
01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:56.150
these bitches are going to scream and yell at each other over nothing.

2557
01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:57.380
And they talk about nonsense.

2558
01:10:57.381 --> 01:10:58.880
They're minds are filled with air.

2559
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.450
There's no nothing going on other than she said this and I said this and I was

2560
01:11:02.451 --> 01:11:02.601
like,

2561
01:11:02.601 --> 01:11:03.291
fuck you bitch.

2562
01:11:03.291 --> 01:11:04.190
You don't even fucking know me.

2563
01:11:04.191 --> 01:11:05.024
Don't fuck with me.

2564
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:06.260
What are you watching?

2565
01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:08.270
You're watching more on squawk.

2566
01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:09.890
You're not even watching a language.

2567
01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:10.960
You watching birds going.

2568
01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.511
That's what you're watching.

2569
01:11:13.511 --> 01:11:15.930
You watching the human equivalent to crows,

2570
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.460
the nonsense people.

2571
01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:20.760
But you can make money off them and you put them on TV if you're lazy.

2572
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:22.590
But did the people that are producing those shows,

2573
01:11:22.591 --> 01:11:23.760
is that their true interest?

2574
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.630
You don't know.

2575
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:25.750
I mean there's,

2576
01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.690
in some ways it's kind of fun cause it's like the fast food of,

2577
01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:29.610
of television.

2578
01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.151
You know,

2579
01:11:30.151 --> 01:11:31.270
if you're sitting there eating lunch,

2580
01:11:31.271 --> 01:11:34.050
she turned on the TV real quick and you watch two bitches yell at each other,

2581
01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:34.681
you fucking,

2582
01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:35.041
who am I?

2583
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:35.840
Tits are real.

2584
01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:36.090
You know,

2585
01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:36.930
he watched that shit.

2586
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:37.560
It'll,

2587
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.250
you'll laugh,

2588
01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:38.770
you'll you,

2589
01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:39.630
you goof at it.

2590
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.430
But the problem is that it becomes a major part of our programming when it,

2591
01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:44.750
you know,

2592
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:47.310
it's x amount of percentage of all that's on television.

2593
01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:48.241
<v 7>Absolutely.</v>

2594
01:11:48.241 --> 01:11:48.941
Absolutely.

2595
01:11:48.941 --> 01:11:49.341
In any,

2596
01:11:49.341 --> 01:11:52.590
it affects us in ways that so many people don't really understand.

2597
01:11:52.591 --> 01:11:53.280
I mean,

2598
01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.720
even like with myself,

2599
01:11:55.050 --> 01:11:56.640
when I look back at my life,

2600
01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:01.700
I know that television movies affected how I made my decisions because that

2601
01:12:03.211 --> 01:12:04.350
became my reality.

2602
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.070
You know?

2603
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:07.530
And when you're young and you're impressionable,

2604
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:09.390
then you see something and you say,

2605
01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:09.781
Oh man,

2606
01:12:09.781 --> 01:12:10.650
that shit is real.

2607
01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:11.311
Yeah,

2608
01:12:11.311 --> 01:12:13.530
I'm gonna try that myself and see if it works for me.

2609
01:12:13.531 --> 01:12:13.771
You know,

2610
01:12:13.771 --> 01:12:15.570
just like with this Guy William Roberts,

2611
01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.920
a new rapid is using my name Rick Ross.

2612
01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.073
Uh,

2613
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:26.600
I believe that he's given kids the wrong impression that you can go out and sell

2614
01:12:26.671 --> 01:12:29.670
drugs and parlay that into a a record career.

2615
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:34.320
And I believe this is going to have a tremendous backlash on our young,

2616
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:35.333
on our young people.

2617
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:37.250
<v 1>That's also an issue with you.</v>

2618
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:37.630
You,

2619
01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:40.830
this guy using your name and it's not a guy like Jay z to choose your name,

2620
01:12:40.831 --> 01:12:41.664
who's a,

2621
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:42.181
you know,

2622
01:12:42.181 --> 01:12:43.890
an excellent member of the community.

2623
01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.050
A guy who's a real good business man,

2624
01:12:46.051 --> 01:12:47.040
a guy who was very smart.

2625
01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:48.000
It doesn't say stupid shit.

2626
01:12:48.001 --> 01:12:48.834
And his raps,

2627
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:50.360
your fiance.

2628
01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:51.493
That was Beyonce.

2629
01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:53.730
That's all I care.

2630
01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:54.750
Yeah,

2631
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:55.441
I mean you're,

2632
01:12:55.441 --> 01:12:58.740
you're looking at a guy who's a preposterous person and so,

2633
01:12:58.741 --> 01:12:59.071
you know,

2634
01:12:59.071 --> 01:12:59.401
his,

2635
01:12:59.401 --> 01:13:04.401
his whole persona is sort of really the polar opposite of everything that you

2636
01:13:05.041 --> 01:13:07.030
have been speaking about since you got out.

2637
01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:07.990
<v 7>What I learned,</v>

2638
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.291
I mean,

2639
01:13:08.291 --> 01:13:08.590
you know,

2640
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:13.590
I learned now that I was duped and then I was bamboozled into believing that did

2641
01:13:13.871 --> 01:13:16.150
I was one thing in and I could have been anything.

2642
01:13:16.151 --> 01:13:16.750
You know,

2643
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:21.040
if somebody would've came to me like you did [inaudible] and gave me the t shirt

2644
01:13:21.041 --> 01:13:21.660
game,

2645
01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:23.140
then I would have been selling tee shirts.

2646
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:28.480
So I believe that what he's doing is basically what he's doing is,

2647
01:13:28.481 --> 01:13:31.060
is lacing the kids' boots just like you did with me,

2648
01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:33.310
but he's lacing them for negativity

2649
01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.910
<v 1>and it's a bullshit story.</v>

2650
01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:38.450
His story is a bullshit story and it doesn't work as a fairy tale.

2651
01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:39.351
It's a fairy tale.

2652
01:13:39.351 --> 01:13:40.850
So I think that,

2653
01:13:40.851 --> 01:13:41.150
um,

2654
01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:44.990
your story is also a very important story for people to,

2655
01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:45.260
uh,

2656
01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:49.490
to listen to when there's a lot of folks that have that sort of nonsense.

2657
01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:53.420
You got to pull yourself up by your bootstraps mentality when it comes to

2658
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:55.520
certain aspects of our society,

2659
01:13:55.521 --> 01:13:59.000
especially people that grow up in a impoverished areas,

2660
01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:00.350
people that grow up in the ghetto,

2661
01:14:00.351 --> 01:14:01.220
there's this sort of,

2662
01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:04.220
well you got to fucking make it out on your own sort of mentality.

2663
01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:07.460
I think that's a crazy way to look at raising children.

2664
01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.030
I do too.

2665
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:09.200
I think it's insane.

2666
01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:10.620
I think this does not,

2667
01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:12.820
there's only one way to raise children correctly.

2668
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.200
Love and someone who they can respect and someone who provides a good example,

2669
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:18.700
someone who they can learn from.

2670
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.710
And if a kid is not around that there,

2671
01:14:21.730 --> 01:14:21.950
it's,

2672
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:22.960
it's a free for all.

2673
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:23.580
Absolutely.

2674
01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:24.670
And you don't know where he's gonna land.

2675
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.060
Right?

2676
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:28.310
And they're being raised essentially by a bunch of people that grew up in the

2677
01:14:28.311 --> 01:14:29.710
same exact environment.

2678
01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:31.720
So there's no breaking that cycle.

2679
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:32.583
It's a cycle.

2680
01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:36.910
And I think that's one of the biggest problems in our entire society.

2681
01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:40.390
And I think that we spent all this time looking at things that can weaken

2682
01:14:40.391 --> 01:14:45.391
America overseas when the number one most important commodity in,

2683
01:14:47.471 --> 01:14:47.741
in,

2684
01:14:47.741 --> 01:14:48.540
in our,

2685
01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:50.620
our culture is us itself,

2686
01:14:50.621 --> 01:14:51.454
human beings.

2687
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:53.440
The more we w all,

2688
01:14:53.441 --> 01:14:55.060
everything that's been built,

2689
01:14:55.061 --> 01:14:56.620
every pit thing that's been invented,

2690
01:14:56.621 --> 01:14:59.320
everything that's been engineered,

2691
01:14:59.321 --> 01:15:02.920
everything that's on this earth that makes our life better is made by a human.

2692
01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:07.900
That means a human invented that that means all this potential that's in these

2693
01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:09.130
impoverished communities.

2694
01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:09.880
It gets ignored.

2695
01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.120
All this potential we'll have of discovery,

2696
01:15:13.121 --> 01:15:14.560
of curiosity,

2697
01:15:14.561 --> 01:15:16.750
of of creativity.

2698
01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:21.780
All of it gets wasted in a world of crime and and repeating cycles and that as a

2699
01:15:23.021 --> 01:15:24.970
resource and no one looks at no one,

2700
01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:26.290
no one in this country looks at that.

2701
01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:27.040
We look at,

2702
01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:27.251
Oh,

2703
01:15:27.251 --> 01:15:27.941
we need oil.

2704
01:15:27.941 --> 01:15:28.840
We got to go over here.

2705
01:15:28.841 --> 01:15:29.470
We looked at this.

2706
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:32.950
Our number one resource is human beings are the bay.

2707
01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:33.191
I mean,

2708
01:15:33.191 --> 01:15:36.430
and when you look at resources like what is important to us as humans,

2709
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:37.420
other humans,

2710
01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.090
man,

2711
01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:40.870
other humans have it set up so we don't have to go hunt some food.

2712
01:15:40.871 --> 01:15:42.910
We can go to the store and buy a steak.

2713
01:15:43.090 --> 01:15:43.361
You know,

2714
01:15:43.361 --> 01:15:44.350
you don't even have to cook it.

2715
01:15:44.351 --> 01:15:45.011
You go right next door,

2716
01:15:45.011 --> 01:15:46.090
there's places bad ass,

2717
01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:46.470
they'll,

2718
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:47.380
they'll cook it for you.

2719
01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:48.251
They know what to do,

2720
01:15:48.251 --> 01:15:49.180
they know the right seasonings.

2721
01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:49.541
And he's like,

2722
01:15:49.541 --> 01:15:49.841
we've,

2723
01:15:49.841 --> 01:15:54.841
we've simplified the whole game of being a human being because we're important

2724
01:15:55.750 --> 01:16:00.010
because so many of us get together and we provide the resources for each other

2725
01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:02.230
and we have a system and it all works out well.

2726
01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.820
Well you got to got to look at it in terms of where,

2727
01:16:06.850 --> 01:16:07.900
where does that all come from?

2728
01:16:07.901 --> 01:16:09.040
It all comes from children.

2729
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:09.903
It all comes from,

2730
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.530
that's when you really have your shot.

2731
01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.290
You really have your shot when you growing and developing and learning things.

2732
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.951
And so your,

2733
01:16:14.951 --> 01:16:16.570
your story is a really,

2734
01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:21.571
really important story to be told because your finding yourself in a situation

2735
01:16:22.601 --> 01:16:26.550
where you couldn't read and you're already out of high school and you,

2736
01:16:26.610 --> 01:16:30.820
you find yourself all of a sudden involved in this drug d game.

2737
01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:35.880
And that seems like the only prospect say you couldn't go to school for,

2738
01:16:35.881 --> 01:16:36.160
for,

2739
01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:36.701
for uh,

2740
01:16:36.701 --> 01:16:38.560
for tennis because he did not read.

2741
01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.570
You made it through school system without knowing how to read.

2742
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:43.750
And that's common that that happens a lot,

2743
01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:45.430
a lot more than people want to admit.

2744
01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:48.130
65% of the guys in prison can't read.

2745
01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.530
That's fucking crazy.

2746
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:53.350
That is fucking crazy.

2747
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:54.090
You know the,

2748
01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:55.120
someone posted something,

2749
01:16:55.121 --> 01:16:56.380
cause I'm always talking about this,

2750
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.370
about how many,

2751
01:16:57.371 --> 01:16:57.940
uh,

2752
01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:02.940
different prisons are privatized in this country and how many are actually

2753
01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:05.260
privately owned institutions.

2754
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.600
That's,

2755
01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.000
that's the big business right now.

2756
01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:07.640
There's,

2757
01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:08.030
it's,

2758
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:12.860
it's somewhere around eight to 10% depending on who you ask of all the prisons

2759
01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:13.550
in this country.

2760
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:14.383
<v 7>And it's switched.</v>

2761
01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.680
When I was in prison,

2762
01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:19.520
they were trying out even the prisons that was owned by the federal government.

2763
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.690
We're starting to turn the prisons over to,

2764
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:24.380
uh,

2765
01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:25.213
to wagon hood,

2766
01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:28.240
<v 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

2767
01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:30.790
It's really crazy.

2768
01:17:30.791 --> 01:17:33.460
The idea that you could put people in jail and you can make money from it,

2769
01:17:33.730 --> 01:17:37.120
and that there's actually like a whole crop of people,

2770
01:17:37.121 --> 01:17:38.680
they're going to come out of this one area.

2771
01:17:38.681 --> 01:17:39.610
As long as the ignore it.

2772
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:40.021
<v 7>Well,</v>

2773
01:17:40.021 --> 01:17:40.501
we're not a,

2774
01:17:40.501 --> 01:17:43.200
they said that they can tell from a kid that's in the third grade,

2775
01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:47.230
if he's going to prison and that was a psychologist or this,

2776
01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.330
that's what they say and yeah,

2777
01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:51.990
<v 1>that's ridiculous that you can't tell her that you could pull that kid out of</v>

2778
01:17:51.991 --> 01:17:52.711
there and straighten them out.

2779
01:17:52.711 --> 01:17:52.891
I mean,

2780
01:17:52.891 --> 01:17:55.080
almost any kid can be raised correctly.

2781
01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.470
It's just almost every kid can be fucked up if they're not raising.

2782
01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.513
<v 7>Absolutely.</v>

2783
01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:00.840
I don't think that it did.

2784
01:18:00.841 --> 01:18:01.381
It did.

2785
01:18:01.381 --> 01:18:03.000
It matters that really the kid,

2786
01:18:03.001 --> 01:18:03.580
it's,

2787
01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:03.820
it's,

2788
01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:04.950
it's really the environment,

2789
01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:05.390
you know,

2790
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:08.850
if you leave a kid in an environment where there's crime,

2791
01:18:09.450 --> 01:18:10.170
uh,

2792
01:18:10.170 --> 01:18:11.850
they'll start to adopt to the crime.

2793
01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:12.190
You know,

2794
01:18:12.190 --> 01:18:13.770
I think the crime is okay and it's,

2795
01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:14.761
I mean,

2796
01:18:14.761 --> 01:18:17.910
because I had got to the point where I believe that that was the way of life.

2797
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:18.511
You know,

2798
01:18:18.511 --> 01:18:19.590
that's how everybody did it.

2799
01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:21.150
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2800
01:18:21.150 --> 01:18:26.040
I think that's the environment that you grow up in is a huge factor on who you

2801
01:18:26.041 --> 01:18:26.820
become.

2802
01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:27.451
It's a huge,

2803
01:18:27.451 --> 01:18:29.760
huge factor and like I said,

2804
01:18:29.761 --> 01:18:33.660
the one of the weakest areas of our country or the places with the most crime

2805
01:18:33.661 --> 01:18:35.280
and the places with the most despair,

2806
01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:38.250
and that's the places that also get the least attention.

2807
01:18:38.251 --> 01:18:39.550
It's like it's like we are,

2808
01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.530
we are a person that has like a pile of garbage in the corner of the house and

2809
01:18:43.531 --> 01:18:44.850
we keep saying we're going to get to it,

2810
01:18:44.851 --> 01:18:47.880
but we just ignore it and walk around it instead of just fixing it.

2811
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:50.130
I said it gives us fixing the situation.

2812
01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:54.780
If we put just a 10th of what we put into our military budget,

2813
01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:58.190
just one 10th to just settle the,

2814
01:18:58.220 --> 01:18:59.580
the inner cities down,

2815
01:18:59.581 --> 01:19:00.960
provide guidance,

2816
01:19:00.961 --> 01:19:01.530
put,

2817
01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:06.240
put places in where people can stay if they have nowhere to go and just educate

2818
01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:06.871
people better.

2819
01:19:06.871 --> 01:19:11.430
Just make it so there's profit in rebuilding cities the same way.

2820
01:19:11.431 --> 01:19:14.460
There's profit and rebuilding cities the way we bomb the fuck out of him.

2821
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:16.590
If we could just figure out how to do that.

2822
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:20.030
<v 7>Was He me and you need to go up in Whitehouse and help Obama out.</v>

2823
01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:20.510
Uh,

2824
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:22.010
because I say it takes some of that money.

2825
01:19:22.011 --> 01:19:23.240
They spend it on the drug war.

2826
01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:23.930
You know,

2827
01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:26.720
they spend like $60 billion a year fighting,

2828
01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:27.590
fighting drug.

2829
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.861
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2830
01:19:27.861 --> 01:19:29.680
You know what the problem with stopping the drug warriors,

2831
01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.360
there's a whole lot of people fighting the drug war and they'll be out of work.

2832
01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:33.650
That's going to be a real problem.

2833
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:35.330
One of the things that keeps drugs,

2834
01:19:35.331 --> 01:19:36.890
certain drugs illegal as they,

2835
01:19:36.891 --> 01:19:37.071
the,

2836
01:19:37.071 --> 01:19:37.341
you know,

2837
01:19:37.341 --> 01:19:39.650
the prison guards actually have lobbyists.

2838
01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:42.800
They want to make sure that certain drug laws are there.

2839
01:19:42.801 --> 01:19:44.990
They stay in place because that keeps them in business.

2840
01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:45.860
Absolutely.

2841
01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:48.770
Which is career easy that someone would actually,

2842
01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:52.310
without having to be there and see the look in a person's eyes when they slammed

2843
01:19:52.311 --> 01:19:52.550
this,

2844
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:53.390
the sell on them,

2845
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.850
when I'll actually be there and experience their pain,

2846
01:19:56.090 --> 01:20:00.080
they're willing to make that decision because they're so far removed from it.

2847
01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:01.100
It's just them,

2848
01:20:01.190 --> 01:20:01.430
you know,

2849
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:03.890
talking to a lobbyist and you know,

2850
01:20:03.891 --> 01:20:05.340
writing something down and they,

2851
01:20:05.341 --> 01:20:07.160
they sign something and make an agreement,

2852
01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:08.010
shake some hands,

2853
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:08.881
and then all of a sudden,

2854
01:20:08.881 --> 01:20:09.391
boom,

2855
01:20:09.391 --> 01:20:14.070
this cell somewhere down the line gets shot on a man and a man loses his life.

2856
01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:15.031
He loses the,

2857
01:20:15.031 --> 01:20:19.380
the reality of the life that he lived because someone is making some money off

2858
01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:20.340
of him being in jail.

2859
01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:21.950
The children lose a fallacy.

2860
01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:22.381
Yeah.

2861
01:20:22.381 --> 01:20:23.490
Children lose a father.

2862
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:28.550
The wife loses of Yasmin and crazy and for victimless crimes and for some it

2863
01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:31.050
means something completely illogical.

2864
01:20:31.051 --> 01:20:31.980
Like most drugs,

2865
01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:33.570
when you look at most drugs,

2866
01:20:33.571 --> 01:20:34.940
the harm that most drugs do,

2867
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:39.210
this is nothing compared to the harm that legal shit like alcohol does,

2868
01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.590
which nobody's trying to stop.

2869
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:45.360
I never heard a single politician say we need to stop people smoking cigarettes.

2870
01:20:45.361 --> 01:20:46.740
I've never heard one.

2871
01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:49.590
I'm just waiting for one person to stand up and say,

2872
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:55.070
do you know that there is a company that is selling poison that kills half a

2873
01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:58.320
million people every year,

2874
01:20:58.620 --> 01:20:59.760
every year in this country,

2875
01:20:59.761 --> 01:21:02.160
half a million people died because of that.

2876
01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:05.910
This company that's selling poison that they know kills people and they're

2877
01:21:05.911 --> 01:21:07.380
making billions of dollars.

2878
01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:08.641
Well you know what,

2879
01:21:08.641 --> 01:21:10.120
he's going to lose his contribution.

2880
01:21:10.121 --> 01:21:10.891
He so he can't say,

2881
01:21:10.891 --> 01:21:11.020
yeah,

2882
01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:11.581
they can't say it.

2883
01:21:11.581 --> 01:21:12.420
They never will say it.

2884
01:21:12.421 --> 01:21:12.900
But I mean,

2885
01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:16.890
if a new company that came along that was just selling poison to kids,

2886
01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:19.080
would it really be as bad as cigarettes?

2887
01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:19.770
I mean,

2888
01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:22.860
I don't want to compare cigarettes to math because math does a quicker job.

2889
01:21:22.890 --> 01:21:23.400
I mean I'm,

2890
01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.020
I don't want to exaggerate the effect,

2891
01:21:25.230 --> 01:21:27.220
but when you see a dude is like 70 years old,

2892
01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.590
been smoking cigarettes this whole life,

2893
01:21:28.591 --> 01:21:29.424
he's doing this

2894
01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:35.490
and then he takes another drag and you go,

2895
01:21:35.491 --> 01:21:35.970
Whoa,

2896
01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:36.900
they got that dude.

2897
01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:37.600
Yeah.

2898
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:40.650
And they got him and trying to get new ones cause they always kill the

2899
01:21:40.651 --> 01:21:41.220
customers.

2900
01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:41.720
Yeah.

2901
01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:41.930
I mean,

2902
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:42.180
but,

2903
01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:43.290
but they keep you around.

2904
01:21:43.291 --> 01:21:44.190
They slow cook you,

2905
01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:44.941
you know,

2906
01:21:44.941 --> 01:21:45.870
they're like a smoker.

2907
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.201
It's,

2908
01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:47.610
it's only 150 degrees.

2909
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.050
You've got to take a day to cook you,

2910
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:51.240
it takes a long time to kill you with cigarettes.

2911
01:21:51.241 --> 01:21:52.080
It's not a quick thing.

2912
01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:53.311
To me.

2913
01:21:53.311 --> 01:21:53.500
It's,

2914
01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:53.821
it's a,

2915
01:21:53.821 --> 01:21:55.650
it's amazing that no one ever brings it up.

2916
01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:56.940
It never even gets talked about.

2917
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.240
Well,

2918
01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:00.450
somebody like you and you know that we need people that's going to stand up and

2919
01:22:00.670 --> 01:22:02.370
in and educate our people.

2920
01:22:02.371 --> 01:22:03.180
Man,

2921
01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:04.920
I have too many soft skeletons in my closet.

2922
01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:08.400
They need someone that listens to me that's got the fucking feed on the straight

2923
01:22:08.401 --> 01:22:09.234
and narrow.

2924
01:22:09.970 --> 01:22:10.290
Hey,

2925
01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:10.561
I mean,

2926
01:22:10.561 --> 01:22:11.400
nobody's perfect.

2927
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:12.270
We all got,

2928
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:13.290
we all got our phones.

2929
01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:13.741
Oh,

2930
01:22:13.741 --> 01:22:14.011
I know.

2931
01:22:14.011 --> 01:22:14.700
We all have.

2932
01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:15.331
But you know,

2933
01:22:15.331 --> 01:22:19.470
that's my path is definitely not to be in any form of political office.

2934
01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:20.050
It's not a,

2935
01:22:20.050 --> 01:22:20.883
it's not for me.

2936
01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:22.050
I don't have that time.

2937
01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.840
I don't want to like listen to anybody and I don't,

2938
01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:27.390
I don't want to have to do shit I don't want to do.

2939
01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:27.650
Yeah.

2940
01:22:27.650 --> 01:22:28.050
You know,

2941
01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:29.310
I don't want that responsibility.

2942
01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:30.600
This system too.

2943
01:22:30.810 --> 01:22:33.120
I feel like jumping into this system,

2944
01:22:33.121 --> 01:22:35.610
it's like it just jumping into a tank full of sharks.

2945
01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:37.290
It's like you don't know the rules.

2946
01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:40.200
You know how these fucking crazy assholes been operating.

2947
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:41.670
I would like to talk to Arnold.

2948
01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:42.803
I would like to see.

2949
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:46.590
Ask him what the fuck was it like to go from being Mr Olympia?

2950
01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:48.720
Do me and the governor of California.

2951
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:50.220
You don't think he'd come here and sit down with you?

2952
01:22:50.670 --> 01:22:51.503
He might.

2953
01:22:51.630 --> 01:22:52.463
He might.

2954
01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:54.510
I bet I could get them maybe in a year,

2955
01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:55.680
like maybe not right now.

2956
01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:00.390
I'm starting to get bigger examples.

2957
01:23:00.391 --> 01:23:01.340
I'd have to find someone.

2958
01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:02.230
I actually do something.

2959
01:23:02.230 --> 01:23:03.090
Know someone who knows him.

2960
01:23:03.091 --> 01:23:04.560
Bryan Callen did a movie with him.

2961
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:05.950
He said he was great.

2962
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:07.303
He's a great guy.

2963
01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.230
But he was hilarious.

2964
01:23:08.670 --> 01:23:08.920
Fun.

2965
01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.950
And this is like after the scandal with is made everyday

2966
01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.150
<v 7>you so do you know how many men get to have two wives?</v>

2967
01:23:13.151 --> 01:23:14.090
He's living in the same house.

2968
01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.393
<v 0>Damn</v>

2969
01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:17.720
<v 1>the Arnold.</v>

2970
01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:19.230
He's quite a character.

2971
01:23:19.410 --> 01:23:22.110
I would like to talk to him about what it was like to be a governor.

2972
01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.060
Whether it was what he thought it was going to be like.

2973
01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.770
Cause you look at that shit from the outside,

2974
01:23:26.490 --> 01:23:26.761
you know,

2975
01:23:26.761 --> 01:23:27.151
what is it?

2976
01:23:27.151 --> 01:23:29.250
What the hell do you do once you get in there?

2977
01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:29.971
Yeah.

2978
01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.380
How could you fix any of this stuff?

2979
01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.270
I'm looking at her like we don't have any money.

2980
01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:37.280
Like God damn like the money for schools and money for all these programs that

2981
01:23:37.281 --> 01:23:39.150
you wanting in this ga,

2982
01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:39.691
the there's,

2983
01:23:39.691 --> 01:23:40.111
there's,

2984
01:23:40.111 --> 01:23:41.910
there's really not that much resources.

2985
01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:44.460
It's gotta be really difficult and then you've got all these people that try to

2986
01:23:44.461 --> 01:23:46.160
steal all of these people were trying to get,

2987
01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:47.460
<v 7>oh no I'm trying to steal.</v>

2988
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:48.720
They trying to steal from each other.

2989
01:23:48.721 --> 01:23:50.310
You know you got to hide the money from him.

2990
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:53.180
<v 1>I would love to get high with Obama</v>

2991
01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:56.630
<v 0>if I had like one thing,</v>

2992
01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:57.464
if you said,

2993
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:59.580
<v 1>would you like to be able to fly</v>

2994
01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:03.700
<v 0>like through the air like superman for three hours,</v>

2995
01:24:03.850 --> 01:24:08.830
fly wherever you want or sit down smoke weed with Obama for three hours.

2996
01:24:08.831 --> 01:24:09.970
I will take the ladder.

2997
01:24:10.690 --> 01:24:14.350
I would smoke with what Obama more than I would fly like superman for three

2998
01:24:14.351 --> 01:24:15.010
hours.

2999
01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:20.010
And that's saying a lot because flying like superman would be cool as fuck if

3000
01:24:20.261 --> 01:24:20.790
you could do that.

3001
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:25.270
Especially if you were high and you flew like superman flying super formal would

3002
01:24:25.271 --> 01:24:27.700
be better flying a super woman would be backed up.

3003
01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.110
Cause you have boobs and a vagina up.

3004
01:24:29.111 --> 01:24:30.040
You always say this,

3005
01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:30.611
it's not true.

3006
01:24:30.611 --> 01:24:33.090
It's way better to check and then you start crying hour.

3007
01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.170
Get your period halfway in the middle of their flight.

3008
01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:36.643
<v 1>Stop.</v>

3009
01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:38.121
I would,

3010
01:24:38.121 --> 01:24:39.170
every time I would love to talk,

3011
01:24:39.171 --> 01:24:40.004
shut up.

3012
01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:43.820
I would love to talk to that dude and find out what it's like to actually be the

3013
01:24:43.821 --> 01:24:44.130
presence.

3014
01:24:44.130 --> 01:24:44.371
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

3015
01:24:44.371 --> 01:24:46.170
At night we'll talk to him to tell him,

3016
01:24:46.171 --> 01:24:46.480
my guys,

3017
01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:49.620
my homeboys in prison for non violent offenses.

3018
01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:50.550
When you're going to let him out,

3019
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:51.960
<v 1>do you think he would do it?</v>

3020
01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:54.390
Do you think he would ever sit down with someone like you and have a

3021
01:24:54.391 --> 01:24:55.080
conversation?

3022
01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:55.430
He might be,

3023
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.540
yeah.

3024
01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:56.620
<v 7>The only guy that's,</v>

3025
01:24:56.621 --> 01:24:58.270
every map isn't a medical correct.

3026
01:24:58.300 --> 01:24:59.111
It's an hour with me,

3027
01:24:59.111 --> 01:24:59.730
you know,

3028
01:24:59.730 --> 01:25:01.060
but he's what you call his name

3029
01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:01.540
<v 1>duck.</v>

3030
01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:02.373
It's like he can't,

3031
01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.580
he can't win again.

3032
01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:06.610
<v 7>Can you imagine the headlines?</v>

3033
01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:09.160
President Obama sits down with drug dealer.

3034
01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:11.323
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3035
01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:12.561
Yeah.

3036
01:25:12.561 --> 01:25:13.610
But you know,

3037
01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.500
you've shown since you've got out the,

3038
01:25:15.501 --> 01:25:19.460
you've been trying to put people on a path different than the one that you've

3039
01:25:19.461 --> 01:25:20.150
been on.

3040
01:25:20.150 --> 01:25:21.740
I think that's all you can ask for a man.

3041
01:25:22.010 --> 01:25:23.720
He can't ask for a man to not make mistakes.

3042
01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:25.220
We asked for a man is to,

3043
01:25:25.221 --> 01:25:26.090
once he's made mistakes,

3044
01:25:26.091 --> 01:25:30.230
be honest about those mistakes and try to help people to keep them from making

3045
01:25:30.231 --> 01:25:31.430
the same mistakes themselves.

3046
01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:32.331
You've done that.

3047
01:25:32.331 --> 01:25:33.031
That's an example.

3048
01:25:33.031 --> 01:25:33.864
Lee.

3049
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:35.571
<v 7>They still,</v>

3050
01:25:35.571 --> 01:25:35.991
you know,

3051
01:25:35.991 --> 01:25:37.460
want to throw the drug dealer,

3052
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:38.750
the drug B,

3053
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:39.800
<v 1>just listen.</v>

3054
01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:43.940
They don't appreciate that you were a bad motherfucker in an illegal business.

3055
01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:44.600
Okay.

3056
01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:45.560
That's what it is.

3057
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:49.910
The they'd done or appreciate that bad motherfuckers in illegal business are

3058
01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:51.260
still bad motherfuckers.

3059
01:25:51.650 --> 01:25:51.951
You know,

3060
01:25:51.951 --> 01:25:52.430
you just,

3061
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:53.263
you,

3062
01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:54.440
you focused your energies

3063
01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:56.280
<v 7>and I didn't put a gun to nobody's here.</v>

3064
01:25:56.281 --> 01:25:56.491
You know,

3065
01:25:56.491 --> 01:25:57.030
I've never,

3066
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:58.560
I never walked up to nobody and say,

3067
01:25:58.561 --> 01:25:58.880
look,

3068
01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.390
what the fuck are you going to smoke this here?

3069
01:26:01.050 --> 01:26:01.590
Right.

3070
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:02.191
Get the pipe,

3071
01:26:02.191 --> 01:26:04.780
picked the pipe up it on here and smoke it right now.

3072
01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.390
<v 1>Why do you think you would have been able to,</v>

3073
01:26:06.391 --> 01:26:07.110
I mean,

3074
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:08.130
it's really kind of,

3075
01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:09.450
I hate to say this again,

3076
01:26:09.690 --> 01:26:14.070
but it really kind of is a gift that you got stopped from,

3077
01:26:14.130 --> 01:26:14.610
from,

3078
01:26:14.610 --> 01:26:15.090
you know,

3079
01:26:15.090 --> 01:26:18.810
from continuing to sell drugs because there's no old drug dealers,

3080
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:22.590
there's no bold drug dealers and there's no old drug dealers.

3081
01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:23.370
No.

3082
01:26:23.370 --> 01:26:25.530
And there's certainly no old bold drug dealers.

3083
01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:27.020
Right?

3084
01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:30.200
You get to a certain point in time if somebody wants your spot or some,

3085
01:26:30.201 --> 01:26:32.940
there's something going on or there's a lot of money involved,

3086
01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:33.781
shit goes down.

3087
01:26:33.781 --> 01:26:35.940
But you managed to avoid all of that.

3088
01:26:36.210 --> 01:26:37.890
<v 7>And I did 20 years though.</v>

3089
01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.411
<v 1>You did.</v>

3090
01:26:38.411 --> 01:26:39.520
And you learn how to write.

3091
01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:40.330
Okay.

3092
01:26:40.330 --> 01:26:41.710
And when you came out,

3093
01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:42.580
look at you now,

3094
01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:43.461
look at you now.

3095
01:26:43.461 --> 01:26:43.700
You're,

3096
01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:44.770
you're positive.

3097
01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:45.551
You're happy.

3098
01:26:45.551 --> 01:26:47.170
Every time I see you're smiling,

3099
01:26:47.171 --> 01:26:48.790
you have a warm way about you.

3100
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:49.211
You're,

3101
01:26:49.211 --> 01:26:49.511
you know,

3102
01:26:49.511 --> 01:26:50.980
you're very personable with people.

3103
01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:54.490
Like I would never wish 20 years in prison on anybody,

3104
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:58.300
but you handled it about as good as a person can do.

3105
01:26:58.580 --> 01:26:58.791
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

3106
01:26:58.791 --> 01:26:59.180
Well,

3107
01:26:59.180 --> 01:26:59.451
you know,

3108
01:26:59.451 --> 01:27:00.051
when I was there,

3109
01:27:00.051 --> 01:27:02.540
I made up my mind that I wasn't gonna let prison do me.

3110
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.231
Right.

3111
01:27:03.231 --> 01:27:03.441
You know,

3112
01:27:03.441 --> 01:27:05.000
a lot of guys when they come there,

3113
01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.940
they mope around and they cry about being here.

3114
01:27:07.941 --> 01:27:09.170
And what I said is that,

3115
01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:10.101
you know what,

3116
01:27:10.101 --> 01:27:12.260
I'm gonna make the best of this because I'm going home.

3117
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:13.670
Even though I had a life sentence,

3118
01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.470
I always had in the back of my mind that,

3119
01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:16.730
that I was going to get out one day.

3120
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:20.840
And so I started preparing to do that because I knew nobody was going to hire

3121
01:27:20.841 --> 01:27:21.440
me.

3122
01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:21.830
You know,

3123
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:22.690
some told me say,

3124
01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:23.480
man,

3125
01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:24.530
if you ever get out,

3126
01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:27.200
the first thing they going to say about you is you're a drug dealer.

3127
01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:32.060
So you got to do something to where you can

3128
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:36.530
get in and you don't have to need anybody to approve you.

3129
01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:37.281
You know,

3130
01:27:37.281 --> 01:27:38.900
like so many guys,

3131
01:27:38.901 --> 01:27:39.620
they get out,

3132
01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:40.670
they have to go to people,

3133
01:27:40.671 --> 01:27:41.001
you know,

3134
01:27:41.001 --> 01:27:41.701
go to Mcdonald's,

3135
01:27:41.701 --> 01:27:44.120
fill out an application and hoping that they accept them.

3136
01:27:44.121 --> 01:27:44.954
Well,

3137
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.920
I don't work like that,

3138
01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:47.053
right?

3139
01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:50.360
I work two away when nobody has the approved me but myself.

3140
01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:51.421
<v 1>Well that's what you,</v>

3141
01:27:51.421 --> 01:27:52.710
the way you would like to work.

3142
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.760
Yeah.

3143
01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.301
Everybody,

3144
01:27:54.301 --> 01:27:56.130
everybody would like to be in that situation.

3145
01:27:56.131 --> 01:28:00.780
But you demand that and that's what made you a bad motherfucker and an illegal

3146
01:28:00.781 --> 01:28:01.614
business.

3147
01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:05.040
And that's what makes you a bad motherfucker and legal businesses that you focus

3148
01:28:05.041 --> 01:28:05.700
yourself on.

3149
01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:05.940
Yeah.

3150
01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:06.181
It's,

3151
01:28:06.181 --> 01:28:06.871
it's really,

3152
01:28:06.871 --> 01:28:07.560
um,

3153
01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:08.310
it's,

3154
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:12.480
I think like for someone like a Obama or anyone to meet with you,

3155
01:28:12.481 --> 01:28:13.200
I think it's,

3156
01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.650
it's important to give people the,

3157
01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:15.961
the,

3158
01:28:15.961 --> 01:28:19.080
the first of all to show people your story and second of all,

3159
01:28:19.081 --> 01:28:23.160
to let people know that when you make mistakes in life and you can correct those

3160
01:28:23.161 --> 01:28:25.350
and be better because of it and then have,

3161
01:28:25.770 --> 01:28:29.400
part of your contribution is explaining and mistakes and letting them,

3162
01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:30.660
<v 7>and I think that's important.</v>

3163
01:28:30.661 --> 01:28:31.351
It's very important.

3164
01:28:31.351 --> 01:28:34.860
I think it's very important that the people who've made mistakes come back and

3165
01:28:34.861 --> 01:28:35.401
tell others,

3166
01:28:35.401 --> 01:28:35.521
well,

3167
01:28:35.521 --> 01:28:35.941
you know what?

3168
01:28:35.941 --> 01:28:36.900
If you go that way,

3169
01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:38.250
this is what's going to happen.

3170
01:28:38.251 --> 01:28:39.210
But a lot of people,

3171
01:28:39.211 --> 01:28:39.660
you know,

3172
01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:40.493
they,

3173
01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:42.540
they don't look at it that way.

3174
01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:42.880
You know,

3175
01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:45.210
like sometimes I want to go out and speak to kids and they,

3176
01:28:45.490 --> 01:28:46.200
uh,

3177
01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:49.140
one day I'm at a US high school in La and,

3178
01:28:49.141 --> 01:28:49.974
uh,

3179
01:28:50.130 --> 01:28:51.240
they call the news and tell them,

3180
01:28:51.241 --> 01:28:51.331
hey,

3181
01:28:51.331 --> 01:28:54.870
they got a drug dealer on the campus and saw the news crew.

3182
01:28:54.871 --> 01:28:56.250
They shoot down to the school and,

3183
01:28:56.251 --> 01:28:58.350
and just as I'm walking out and they like,

3184
01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:59.070
uh,

3185
01:28:59.070 --> 01:29:00.780
where's the drug do they says a drug dealer on?

3186
01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:02.161
And I said,

3187
01:29:02.161 --> 01:29:02.341
no,

3188
01:29:02.341 --> 01:29:03.480
I was an ex drug dealer.

3189
01:29:04.290 --> 01:29:05.040
And uh,

3190
01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:05.310
they said,

3191
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:05.821
oh no,

3192
01:29:05.821 --> 01:29:07.230
we thought it was somebody else.

3193
01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:09.120
So,

3194
01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:09.600
you know,

3195
01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:10.500
sensationalism.

3196
01:29:10.501 --> 01:29:11.430
They're just looking for,

3197
01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:13.090
for things to be excited.

3198
01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:13.251
When,

3199
01:29:13.251 --> 01:29:13.471
you know,

3200
01:29:13.471 --> 01:29:14.640
negative news sales,

3201
01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:15.670
you know,

3202
01:29:15.670 --> 01:29:17.940
they're not looking for anything positive.

3203
01:29:18.450 --> 01:29:20.310
They don't want to portray a positiveness in,

3204
01:29:20.311 --> 01:29:20.611
in,

3205
01:29:20.611 --> 01:29:21.630
in what I'm doing.

3206
01:29:21.631 --> 01:29:22.441
And you know,

3207
01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:25.740
and I can deal with that because I'm not doing it for their approval.

3208
01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:28.250
I'm doing it because this is what I liked doing and,

3209
01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:29.940
and I think it's the right thing for me to do.

3210
01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.500
<v 1>I think it's the right thing for you to,</v>

3211
01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:31.620
to,

3212
01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:32.100
to,

3213
01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:36.960
and I think that what you said about that it's good for people to see these

3214
01:29:37.050 --> 01:29:40.800
examples of people who've made mistakes and explained their mistakes.

3215
01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.960
I think it's something that's missing in our world,

3216
01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:43.501
you know?

3217
01:29:43.501 --> 01:29:47.190
And I think that if there were more books written instead of just about crime

3218
01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:48.240
and glorifying crime,

3219
01:29:48.241 --> 01:29:51.900
how about written about dudes who did shit and wish they could take it back?

3220
01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:53.130
You know?

3221
01:29:53.130 --> 01:29:55.620
How about talk to dudes who murdered their wife and like,

3222
01:29:55.621 --> 01:29:56.340
God damn it,

3223
01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:57.300
I love that girl.

3224
01:29:57.301 --> 01:29:58.850
Like what the fuck was wrong with me?

3225
01:29:58.851 --> 01:29:58.970
Well,

3226
01:29:58.970 --> 01:30:02.250
once you settled down and you realize how crazy were you when he killed someone

3227
01:30:02.251 --> 01:30:03.500
and then there's no,

3228
01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:06.060
there's very few books where people are honest about that,

3229
01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:06.923
about,

3230
01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:07.110
<v 7>oh,</v>

3231
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:08.820
we'll let someone else guys in prisons,

3232
01:30:08.821 --> 01:30:09.180
you know,

3233
01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:13.650
I think that we should have a system where guys and an in prison in these

3234
01:30:13.651 --> 01:30:16.740
maximum security prison get away to tell the kids,

3235
01:30:16.741 --> 01:30:17.574
what is it like,

3236
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:18.271
you know,

3237
01:30:18.271 --> 01:30:21.600
sitting in a cell by yourself 23 hours a day or 24 hours a day.

3238
01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:22.171
<v 1>Well,</v>

3239
01:30:22.171 --> 01:30:23.610
I know they had that scared straight.

3240
01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:25.531
You know,

3241
01:30:25.531 --> 01:30:29.220
they had that a scared straight program that they were doing kids for a while.

3242
01:30:29.221 --> 01:30:30.930
They all made a lot of videos about that.

3243
01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.153
Do you remember that?

3244
01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:33.680
<v 7>I remember that when I was growing up.</v>

3245
01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:34.573
Uh,

3246
01:30:35.710 --> 01:30:38.030
I mean something even more because I don't,

3247
01:30:38.031 --> 01:30:41.180
I don't know if that was real or not seem a little theatrical.

3248
01:30:41.181 --> 01:30:41.510
Right.

3249
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.871
Yeah.

3250
01:30:41.871 --> 01:30:45.440
I'm talking about something that it's really cause a lot of those guys in

3251
01:30:45.441 --> 01:30:46.160
prison,

3252
01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:46.993
you know,

3253
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:48.830
even like the Guy Larry Hoover,

3254
01:30:48.831 --> 01:30:49.101
who,

3255
01:30:49.101 --> 01:30:49.934
uh,

3256
01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:51.380
who the rapper rapped about,

3257
01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:53.060
I think a guy like him,

3258
01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:58.540
he's famous and he would be great to reach out to the kids and tell the kids

3259
01:30:58.791 --> 01:31:00.380
what it's like to live in the maximum,

3260
01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:00.800
you know,

3261
01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:01.940
one of the most secure printers,

3262
01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.680
penitentiaries in the United States.

3263
01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:04.791
I mean,

3264
01:31:04.791 --> 01:31:06.710
cause I'm even fascinated with what it's like in there.

3265
01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:06.951
You know,

3266
01:31:06.951 --> 01:31:07.541
I hear that they're,

3267
01:31:07.541 --> 01:31:10.460
they're locked down 23 hours a day.

3268
01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:11.150
Uh,

3269
01:31:11.150 --> 01:31:13.010
the shower moves to their door.

3270
01:31:13.011 --> 01:31:13.251
So,

3271
01:31:13.251 --> 01:31:13.521
you know,

3272
01:31:13.521 --> 01:31:14.420
you don't come out your cell,

3273
01:31:14.421 --> 01:31:15.254
the shower,

3274
01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:16.363
um,

3275
01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.230
your mail comes over a screen.

3276
01:31:18.530 --> 01:31:19.363
I mean,

3277
01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:20.481
it's like terrible.

3278
01:31:20.481 --> 01:31:21.770
You don't have any human contact.

3279
01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:22.710
Wow.

3280
01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:24.690
<v 1>So everyone's essentially in solitary.</v>

3281
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:25.440
Yup.

3282
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.880
And then one hour a day you are you,

3283
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:28.230
are you allowed to mingle with people?

3284
01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:28.461
<v 7>Well,</v>

3285
01:31:28.461 --> 01:31:29.750
you're allowed to go out in the sun.

3286
01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:32.030
<v 1>And is there other people out there as well?</v>

3287
01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:32.990
I don't think so.

3288
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:34.460
So you go out in the sun by herself,

3289
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:36.410
<v 7>right in a little box.</v>

3290
01:31:36.411 --> 01:31:37.790
I think they use a little box,

3291
01:31:37.791 --> 01:31:38.120
you know,

3292
01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:38.600
where,

3293
01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:39.440
Oh my God,

3294
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:42.020
the sun can shine down probably through a window or something.

3295
01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:42.831
You know,

3296
01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:44.130
they let you play handball or,

3297
01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:45.050
or something like that.

3298
01:31:45.050 --> 01:31:46.130
Oh my God,

3299
01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:46.850
what a,

3300
01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:47.900
I hear this awful thing,

3301
01:31:47.901 --> 01:31:48.261
you know?

3302
01:31:48.261 --> 01:31:48.471
And,

3303
01:31:48.471 --> 01:31:50.890
and we got guys there that,

3304
01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:52.550
that should be able to tell the stories.

3305
01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:53.221
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3306
01:31:53.221 --> 01:31:54.420
That's a crazy life.

3307
01:31:54.450 --> 01:31:55.283
That's um,

3308
01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.180
the world changing,

3309
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:59.710
<v 7>not the way I had planned on living life and,</v>

3310
01:31:59.711 --> 01:32:00.131
and you know,

3311
01:32:00.131 --> 01:32:01.750
I was close to it to living like that.

3312
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.860
You know,

3313
01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:02.990
I,

3314
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:07.090
I missed that by really just a few decisions.

3315
01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:07.430
You know,

3316
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:10.780
I made a few of the right decisions at the right time and,

3317
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:11.071
and,

3318
01:32:11.071 --> 01:32:16.000
and it's bad me from being in that position because I could have made some

3319
01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:18.220
decisions that could have landed media.

3320
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:19.121
You know,

3321
01:32:19.121 --> 01:32:22.390
it was times that other people were suggesting doing is here,

3322
01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:24.220
dude is here something violent,

3323
01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:25.090
something violent,

3324
01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:25.421
you know,

3325
01:32:25.421 --> 01:32:28.570
somebody had run off with some money and you know,

3326
01:32:28.571 --> 01:32:30.490
my guys and man let's teach them a lesson,

3327
01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:32.081
you know,

3328
01:32:32.081 --> 01:32:33.310
and it's something just,

3329
01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:33.641
you know,

3330
01:32:33.641 --> 01:32:34.474
just told me,

3331
01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:34.871
Nah,

3332
01:32:34.871 --> 01:32:35.710
that ain't the way to go.

3333
01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.990
<v 1>Well the is very intelligent and that you did that.</v>

3334
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.943
It's um,

3335
01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:40.740
I think it's a,

3336
01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:41.600
your story,

3337
01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:42.700
like I said,

3338
01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:44.360
it's very important for young people.

3339
01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:49.720
I remember very clearly how stupid I was when I was 13 or 14 or I would think

3340
01:32:50.001 --> 01:32:51.740
about the future and where it would be.

3341
01:32:51.741 --> 01:32:53.420
And I really remember like,

3342
01:32:53.550 --> 01:32:57.800
I could've made a million dumb decisions when I was that age.

3343
01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:03.160
And I think every time you as a young man get to see the example of people

3344
01:33:03.621 --> 01:33:06.290
who've made mistakes and correct them or you know,

3345
01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.880
went the wrong way in life.

3346
01:33:07.881 --> 01:33:12.170
And then re re wrote their path later in life and became successful.

3347
01:33:12.171 --> 01:33:14.210
I think those are the really important for,

3348
01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:17.030
for young people to shape their vision of the world.

3349
01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:19.490
To understand that there's going to be decisions that you're going to have to

3350
01:33:19.491 --> 01:33:22.700
make and part of the learning process is making the wrong decision.

3351
01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.613
<v 7>Absolutely.</v>

3352
01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:23.921
Well,

3353
01:33:23.921 --> 01:33:24.221
you know,

3354
01:33:24.221 --> 01:33:28.180
a one time I read a book about a guy in a,

3355
01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:33.300
he was saying that people think that he's smart and he said that he don't think

3356
01:33:33.431 --> 01:33:33.901
he's smart.

3357
01:33:33.901 --> 01:33:35.710
He just made a lot of bad decisions.

3358
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:38.350
And by making so many bad decisions,

3359
01:33:38.351 --> 01:33:39.670
he made a few correct ones.

3360
01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:40.633
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3361
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.500
That,

3362
01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:46.880
that is a weird thing where we want people to have never made any bad decisions.

3363
01:33:46.881 --> 01:33:49.700
We want you to only be correct all the time.

3364
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.903
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

3365
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.360
And,

3366
01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:52.530
and you have to develop,

3367
01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:52.951
you know,

3368
01:33:52.951 --> 01:33:53.784
one of the things that,

3369
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:54.091
that,

3370
01:33:54.091 --> 01:33:54.390
that,

3371
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.960
that,

3372
01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:55.793
um,

3373
01:33:56.010 --> 01:33:58.140
that I've been telling the young people I'm working with right now.

3374
01:33:58.141 --> 01:33:58.351
You know,

3375
01:33:58.351 --> 01:33:59.780
I've got a young artist that I'm,

3376
01:33:59.850 --> 01:34:00.960
that I'm working with right now.

3377
01:34:00.961 --> 01:34:03.170
See Carter shout out to see Carter.

3378
01:34:03.171 --> 01:34:04.940
Y'All check out at AMC on

3379
01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:06.930
<v 1>you're managing or managing it.</v>

3380
01:34:06.931 --> 01:34:07.390
Managing.

3381
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:09.850
See Dope to see Carter is sealed,

3382
01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:10.870
like let her see.

3383
01:34:10.930 --> 01:34:11.470
Yeah,

3384
01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:12.370
and then another c.

3385
01:34:12.371 --> 01:34:13.870
A.

3386
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:13.870
R.

3387
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:13.870
T.

3388
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:13.870
E.

3389
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:13.870
R.

3390
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:14.020
Yup.

3391
01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:14.810
See Carter.

3392
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:18.110
<v 7>And when the main things that I'm trying to get her to understand and she got it</v>

3393
01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:18.560
she's had,

3394
01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.940
she has a remarkable story too,

3395
01:34:19.941 --> 01:34:22.830
when people investigate it and find out what she comes from,

3396
01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:27.800
and she was telling me she's never had anybody like me to give her the advice

3397
01:34:27.801 --> 01:34:28.634
that I'm giving it.

3398
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.980
And one of the things that I tell her is that you must continue to develop in

3399
01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:33.950
order to develop,

3400
01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:36.440
you have to try new things and when you try new things,

3401
01:34:36.441 --> 01:34:37.550
you're going to make some mistakes.

3402
01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.190
Long as you don't make mistakes,

3403
01:34:40.191 --> 01:34:42.290
it's going to send you to prison or kill you.

3404
01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:43.693
You good?

3405
01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:45.640
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3406
01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:48.760
As long as you make the mistakes that you're just taking chances,

3407
01:34:48.761 --> 01:34:50.320
you're not doing something fucked up.

3408
01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:51.040
Exactly.

3409
01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:51.460
Yeah.

3410
01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:54.090
There's a lot of mistakes that are most important things that you're ever going

3411
01:34:54.091 --> 01:34:54.924
to do in your life.

3412
01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:57.500
Some of the failures that I've had over years,

3413
01:34:57.501 --> 01:35:01.280
I've been like the motivating factors for success times a million.

3414
01:35:01.281 --> 01:35:04.940
Like if I had done well instead of just failed miserably,

3415
01:35:05.150 --> 01:35:08.060
maybe I wouldn't have gotten so excited about picking up the pieces and get my

3416
01:35:08.061 --> 01:35:08.900
shit together again.

3417
01:35:08.901 --> 01:35:09.141
You know?

3418
01:35:09.141 --> 01:35:12.650
I think that some of the biggest fuck ups I've ever had are like the most

3419
01:35:12.651 --> 01:35:14.150
motivating factors in my life.

3420
01:35:14.290 --> 01:35:15.123
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

3421
01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:16.413
You know,

3422
01:35:16.450 --> 01:35:18.040
I think people need to hear that ma'am.

3423
01:35:18.570 --> 01:35:18.751
<v 7>Well,</v>

3424
01:35:18.751 --> 01:35:19.620
definitely for mine.

3425
01:35:19.621 --> 01:35:20.040
You know,

3426
01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:23.640
one of the biggest mistakes I made was to get involved with selling cocaine,

3427
01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:24.511
you know,

3428
01:35:24.511 --> 01:35:25.620
but it's been one of the,

3429
01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.760
probably the most educational things in my whole life.

3430
01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:30.061
You know,

3431
01:35:30.061 --> 01:35:32.010
I spent in the whole game,

3432
01:35:32.011 --> 01:35:33.240
I spent about 28 years,

3433
01:35:33.241 --> 01:35:33.451
you know,

3434
01:35:33.451 --> 01:35:36.360
selling it for eight and then the 20 years I did in prison.

3435
01:35:36.361 --> 01:35:41.130
So it was a big chunk of my life that I spent in that game.

3436
01:35:41.131 --> 01:35:43.260
But I learned so much from that,

3437
01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:45.480
that a man I couldn't,

3438
01:35:45.570 --> 01:35:46.770
I wouldn't give it back for nothing.

3439
01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:48.340
<v 1>It's a fascinating thing,</v>

3440
01:35:48.341 --> 01:35:48.880
isn't it?

3441
01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.610
It's just the life that you think you're going to live when you were a kid,

3442
01:35:51.611 --> 01:35:56.290
watching TV shows and then the actual life that you've lived at for all these

3443
01:35:56.290 --> 01:35:56.350
years.

3444
01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:57.183
Yeah.

3445
01:35:57.420 --> 01:35:58.510
It gets very strange,

3446
01:35:58.511 --> 01:35:58.990
doesn't it?

3447
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.501
<v 7>It does.</v>

3448
01:35:59.501 --> 01:35:59.871
It does.

3449
01:35:59.871 --> 01:36:00.020
It

3450
01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:01.840
<v 2>the [inaudible]</v>

3451
01:36:02.210 --> 01:36:03.230
<v 1>now you,</v>

3452
01:36:03.231 --> 01:36:07.070
I know you're in the middle of some sort of a court case with this dude who's

3453
01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:08.000
stealing your name.

3454
01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:09.020
What,

3455
01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:10.370
where does it stand right now?

3456
01:36:10.930 --> 01:36:11.111
<v 7>Oh,</v>

3457
01:36:11.111 --> 01:36:12.670
we have a trial date right now,

3458
01:36:12.730 --> 01:36:13.121
uh,

3459
01:36:13.121 --> 01:36:14.110
against one of brothers.

3460
01:36:14.111 --> 01:36:15.880
We go to trial August of 27.

3461
01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:17.353
<v 2>MMM.</v>

3462
01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:19.200
<v 7>Just come from court for that right now.</v>

3463
01:36:20.970 --> 01:36:21.930
Can't talk about it.

3464
01:36:22.050 --> 01:36:22.650
Right.

3465
01:36:22.650 --> 01:36:23.080
<v 2>Uh,</v>

3466
01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:23.913
but

3467
01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:24.810
<v 7>you know,</v>

3468
01:36:24.810 --> 01:36:24.971
I,

3469
01:36:24.971 --> 01:36:26.190
I'm not going to give up,

3470
01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:27.183
you know,

3471
01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:29.400
no matter what they do and you know,

3472
01:36:29.490 --> 01:36:31.200
they throw all these lorries at me,

3473
01:36:31.230 --> 01:36:32.063
you know,

3474
01:36:32.250 --> 01:36:35.220
<v 6>have they tried to give you like a settlement or has anybody tried to,</v>

3475
01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:37.230
would you ever license your name if you want?

3476
01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:37.650
Like,

3477
01:36:37.650 --> 01:36:37.861
like,

3478
01:36:37.861 --> 01:36:38.011
Hey,

3479
01:36:38.011 --> 01:36:39.180
I get 30% of everything.

3480
01:36:39.181 --> 01:36:40.014
Yeah.

3481
01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:40.950
<v 7>I don't want to,</v>

3482
01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:42.240
you know,

3483
01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:42.660
uh,

3484
01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:43.590
but at the same time,

3485
01:36:43.591 --> 01:36:44.424
you know,

3486
01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:45.533
I'm really

3487
01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:47.220
<v 2>okay.</v>

3488
01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:48.660
<v 7>Tired of dealing with,</v>

3489
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:49.650
with this issue,

3490
01:36:49.651 --> 01:36:50.140
you know,

3491
01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:53.320
<v 6>maybe you could license it openly on the Internet and a lot of people can become</v>

3492
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.830
Red Cross.

3493
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:54.461
Oh yeah.

3494
01:36:54.461 --> 01:36:59.090
That would make it a website you want Rick Ross the Internet with Rick Ross is

3495
01:36:59.290 --> 01:37:03.340
if you do like as a paypal thing where it's only five bucks and for five bucks

3496
01:37:03.341 --> 01:37:04.570
you could use the name Rick Ross.

3497
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:06.550
So all these people's websites,

3498
01:37:06.551 --> 01:37:11.551
so like the newest of the new Rick Ross and obvious like white dudes with red

3499
01:37:11.561 --> 01:37:15.940
hair pretending to be the newest Rick Ross because they licensed that for five

3500
01:37:15.941 --> 01:37:20.770
bucks and then that should becomes a joke and then he becomes a ridiculous

3501
01:37:20.771 --> 01:37:21.604
person.

3502
01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.593
Ridiculous.

3503
01:37:23.410 --> 01:37:24.940
And he'd probably make a lot of fucking money.

3504
01:37:24.941 --> 01:37:25.810
And by the way,

3505
01:37:25.811 --> 01:37:26.441
the other people,

3506
01:37:26.441 --> 01:37:27.940
how long are they going to keep using that name?

3507
01:37:27.970 --> 01:37:28.061
Oh,

3508
01:37:28.061 --> 01:37:28.601
like a week.

3509
01:37:28.601 --> 01:37:28.991
They're going to just,

3510
01:37:28.991 --> 01:37:29.970
it's gonna fuck around,

3511
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.883
you know,

3512
01:37:30.930 --> 01:37:31.990
adopted forever.

3513
01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.700
A lot of people would and tattoo it on them.

3514
01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:37.060
At least one dude,

3515
01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.040
at least one new we tattooed on him.

3516
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:42.280
Did you see that crazy girl who met a dude for 24 hours?

3517
01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:44.950
And then had him tattoo his name on her face.

3518
01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:45.430
Yes.

3519
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:48.580
That was the most horrific thing I've ever seen in my life,

3520
01:37:48.610 --> 01:37:50.310
and let me find the picture of the picture when he can.

3521
01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:51.520
It's unbelievable.

3522
01:37:51.630 --> 01:37:53.170
I guess it was in Russia or something like that.

3523
01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:57.360
Her whole face was this dude's like her out the whole side of her face.

3524
01:37:57.361 --> 01:37:59.100
He tattooed in giant black letters.

3525
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:00.240
His name.

3526
01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:00.780
Wow.

3527
01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:01.380
Yeah.

3528
01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:01.740
Whoa.

3529
01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:02.421
I might try it.

3530
01:38:02.421 --> 01:38:03.270
Find out a thing though.

3531
01:38:03.271 --> 01:38:04.070
That sounded like a,

3532
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.660
yeah,

3533
01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:06.090
it's not a bad idea.

3534
01:38:06.091 --> 01:38:06.870
You can be warm.

3535
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:08.160
You can won't cost me anything.

3536
01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:09.000
Licensed.

3537
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.880
The name Rick Ross it across your $5.

3538
01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:15.720
The only problem with that is then it sets a precedent and then the the the Rick

3539
01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:15.721
Ross,

3540
01:38:15.721 --> 01:38:16.231
Robert Goes,

3541
01:38:16.231 --> 01:38:16.321
well,

3542
01:38:16.321 --> 01:38:17.250
I'll give you five bucks.

3543
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:18.083
Shit,

3544
01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:19.800
look at this.

3545
01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:20.370
Look at this,

3546
01:38:20.370 --> 01:38:22.440
this horrific tattoo.

3547
01:38:22.441 --> 01:38:24.990
This girl got on the left and the right side of her face.

3548
01:38:24.991 --> 01:38:25.890
It's unbelievable.

3549
01:38:27.210 --> 01:38:28.043
It's like a car.

3550
01:38:28.110 --> 01:38:31.170
This guy just tattooed his name across her face.

3551
01:38:31.290 --> 01:38:31.770
This photo,

3552
01:38:31.770 --> 01:38:33.660
it looks like she was a pretty girl.

3553
01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:33.811
Oh,

3554
01:38:33.811 --> 01:38:34.644
she was beautiful.

3555
01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:36.660
They had a picture of her before the Tattoo.

3556
01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:37.823
It's crazy.

3557
01:38:38.130 --> 01:38:38.251
I mean,

3558
01:38:38.251 --> 01:38:39.084
what was she thinking about?

3559
01:38:39.230 --> 01:38:40.000
I don't know.

3560
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:40.833
She's nuts.

3561
01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:42.181
Look at the guy.

3562
01:38:42.181 --> 01:38:43.530
He's got tattoos all over his face.

3563
01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:44.400
Oh,

3564
01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.870
she was really pretty before that.

3565
01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:47.130
Scroll back up again.

3566
01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:51.990
This guy is letting her do this dude.

3567
01:38:51.991 --> 01:38:53.010
He did it to her.

3568
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:55.080
He tattooed her.

3569
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:56.183
What a jerk.

3570
01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:57.300
He's not a nice guy.

3571
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:59.743
It makes me mad.

3572
01:38:59.750 --> 01:39:00.780
World's fucked man.

3573
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:02.790
There's at least one dual tattoo.

3574
01:39:02.791 --> 01:39:04.290
Your name on their knuckles.

3575
01:39:04.890 --> 01:39:05.723
We've been,

3576
01:39:06.170 --> 01:39:07.110
we've been not try that.

3577
01:39:07.230 --> 01:39:07.381
Yeah,

3578
01:39:07.381 --> 01:39:09.510
let's not try that until after the settlement.

3579
01:39:09.930 --> 01:39:10.770
After the settlement.

3580
01:39:10.771 --> 01:39:11.310
After Rick,

3581
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:12.570
inevitably he's going to have to pay you.

3582
01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.980
There's inevitably going to have to pay you,

3583
01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:15.061
but when he pays you,

3584
01:39:15.061 --> 01:39:15.511
what does he do?

3585
01:39:15.511 --> 01:39:16.590
Does it become Rosie?

3586
01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:18.780
Does he change his name and just become Roseanne?

3587
01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:19.673
That's his new,

3588
01:39:20.410 --> 01:39:22.830
he sort of got like a escape identity,

3589
01:39:23.130 --> 01:39:23.963
right?

3590
01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:27.090
He sort of got a bit of an escape identity with that other name,

3591
01:39:27.091 --> 01:39:27.271
right?

3592
01:39:27.271 --> 01:39:27.460
Yeah.

3593
01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:27.780
Yeah.

3594
01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:30.420
He came up with that to offset.

3595
01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:31.470
It's not a bad move.

3596
01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:32.670
He should really commit to that.

3597
01:39:33.690 --> 01:39:35.170
I think he should commit to it,

3598
01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:36.380
to his real name.

3599
01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.760
When you're proud of it.

3600
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.823
Yeah.

3601
01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:39.660
That's still around.

3602
01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:40.740
You didn't come to a concert.

3603
01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:44.370
That's my son up there and if he's built like his dad,

3604
01:39:44.371 --> 01:39:45.450
his dad probably had around,

3605
01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:51.230
I would change my name to r two R Two d two r two R to recross to just arterial.

3606
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:52.530
Yes.

3607
01:39:52.530 --> 01:39:54.810
That's Kinda hip are our dose.

3608
01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:57.780
The whole thing's a mess,

3609
01:39:57.781 --> 01:39:58.370
man.

3610
01:39:58.370 --> 01:39:59.203
Um,

3611
01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:00.570
is it surreal to you?

3612
01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:00.930
I mean,

3613
01:40:00.930 --> 01:40:01.940
how does it feel like to,

3614
01:40:02.210 --> 01:40:04.830
to have a guy that you see on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine,

3615
01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:06.810
you see your name on it and you just like,

3616
01:40:06.811 --> 01:40:07.644
what is the,

3617
01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:09.460
what can you live in?

3618
01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:13.440
Then it kind of lets me know that I did accomplish something in life.

3619
01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:14.250
Right?

3620
01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:14.581
I mean,

3621
01:40:14.581 --> 01:40:15.290
you know when,

3622
01:40:15.290 --> 01:40:17.310
when people start naming themselves after you,

3623
01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:17.521
you know,

3624
01:40:17.521 --> 01:40:18.690
you came right,

3625
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:20.401
you did it.

3626
01:40:20.401 --> 01:40:22.830
So it's such a fascinating way because he did it.

3627
01:40:23.070 --> 01:40:23.581
First of all,

3628
01:40:23.581 --> 01:40:28.581
you avoided violence and then you got out and then learn how to read when

3629
01:40:29.311 --> 01:40:30.000
through fruit,

3630
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.020
through jail and everything.

3631
01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:33.120
And then you came out and then you'll like this peaceful person.

3632
01:40:33.121 --> 01:40:37.440
It's like you managed to avoid like a lot of the negative Karma and negative

3633
01:40:37.441 --> 01:40:38.910
repercussions of that situation,

3634
01:40:38.911 --> 01:40:40.830
but you also managed to keep that,

3635
01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:41.821
that name.

3636
01:40:41.821 --> 01:40:42.361
I mean you,

3637
01:40:42.361 --> 01:40:43.410
you are Rick Ross.

3638
01:40:43.411 --> 01:40:44.244
You're the real Rick Ross.

3639
01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:46.290
I heard about you before you went to jail.

3640
01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:47.460
I heard about you and the news.

3641
01:40:47.630 --> 01:40:48.390
Yeah,

3642
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.840
yeah.

3643
01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:49.560
Fuck yeah.

3644
01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:49.750
Yeah.

3645
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:50.583
Long time ago,

3646
01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:51.533
I think I was in,

3647
01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:53.530
we didn't know what I used to believe

3648
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:55.360
<v 7>when I was in the drug business.</v>

3649
01:40:55.361 --> 01:40:57.070
I believed I was under the radar.

3650
01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.050
I didn't think people know about me.

3651
01:40:59.051 --> 01:40:59.770
Right.

3652
01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:02.740
Because I used to use fake names.

3653
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:03.310
Yeah.

3654
01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:03.581
You know,

3655
01:41:03.581 --> 01:41:04.410
to hide myself.

3656
01:41:04.410 --> 01:41:04.900
You know,

3657
01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:06.670
when I go around people who didn't know me,

3658
01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:07.151
you know,

3659
01:41:07.151 --> 01:41:08.050
all my friends would call me,

3660
01:41:08.051 --> 01:41:08.681
hey Charlie.

3661
01:41:08.681 --> 01:41:09.514
Hey Joe.

3662
01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:09.921
<v 1>Oh,</v>

3663
01:41:09.921 --> 01:41:10.491
all the time.

3664
01:41:10.491 --> 01:41:11.230
Different names.

3665
01:41:11.230 --> 01:41:11.511
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

3666
01:41:11.511 --> 01:41:11.701
yeah,

3667
01:41:11.701 --> 01:41:11.921
yeah,

3668
01:41:11.921 --> 01:41:12.131
yeah.

3669
01:41:12.131 --> 01:41:12.371
You know,

3670
01:41:12.371 --> 01:41:14.980
because you don't want nobody knowing your name because if somebody knows your

3671
01:41:14.981 --> 01:41:17.020
name now they can tell the cops,

3672
01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:17.913
hey,

3673
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.880
that guy is the guy.

3674
01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:19.870
That's the guy right there,

3675
01:41:19.871 --> 01:41:20.441
Rick Ross.

3676
01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:21.110
So,

3677
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:21.370
you know,

3678
01:41:21.370 --> 01:41:23.410
we would go to clubs and stuff like that.

3679
01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:24.940
People would call me anything.

3680
01:41:24.941 --> 01:41:25.721
But Rick Ross,

3681
01:41:25.721 --> 01:41:26.554
you know.

3682
01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.440
<v 1>Now when you found out,</v>

3683
01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:30.700
when you are just,

3684
01:41:30.701 --> 01:41:33.910
you said you were in jail when you found out about the whole connection to the

3685
01:41:33.911 --> 01:41:35.230
Iran Contra scandal.

3686
01:41:35.410 --> 01:41:36.130
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

3687
01:41:36.130 --> 01:41:37.150
How did you find that out?

3688
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:39.183
Well,

3689
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.460
for the folks who don't know well,

3690
01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:42.490
what's happened given the,

3691
01:41:42.491 --> 01:41:42.810
the,

3692
01:41:42.810 --> 01:41:44.110
a little run down run down,

3693
01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:45.310
it was,

3694
01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:48.820
my lawyer calls me when I call my lawyer one day and we talking about my case

3695
01:41:48.821 --> 01:41:49.511
and he tells me,

3696
01:41:49.511 --> 01:41:49.841
he says,

3697
01:41:49.841 --> 01:41:50.141
man,

3698
01:41:50.141 --> 01:41:53.650
this reporter calls me and since he got some stuff for us,

3699
01:41:54.850 --> 01:41:58.210
but he's not going to give us what he got and this and we give me what we got

3700
01:41:58.660 --> 01:41:59.650
and you want to talk to him?

3701
01:41:59.651 --> 01:42:00.710
I'm looking at it life sentence.

3702
01:42:00.711 --> 01:42:01.271
So I'm like,

3703
01:42:01.271 --> 01:42:01.451
man,

3704
01:42:01.451 --> 01:42:04.120
I ain't got nothing to lose and tell him to come on down.

3705
01:42:04.121 --> 01:42:04.954
What are you going to do?

3706
01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.760
He can't do no more than I already done it.

3707
01:42:06.761 --> 01:42:09.940
So he comes down and we started talking and he's telling me about how man this

3708
01:42:09.941 --> 01:42:13.180
thing is bigger than you and you don't know what she was into.

3709
01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:15.700
And then all of a sudden I'm thinking like,

3710
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:17.470
wow,

3711
01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:19.510
cause I just went through the thing with the crooked cops,

3712
01:42:19.570 --> 01:42:20.140
you know,

3713
01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:23.350
lac or if that was planning to drugs and stealing the money and had the houses,

3714
01:42:23.351 --> 01:42:23.920
you know,

3715
01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:25.480
in Arizona on the river and,

3716
01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:26.380
and whatnot.

3717
01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:26.621
Right.

3718
01:42:26.621 --> 01:42:27.454
So what I'm saying,

3719
01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:32.320
well maybe these might be DEA agents and this crooked,

3720
01:42:32.321 --> 01:42:33.154
right?

3721
01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:33.611
So,

3722
01:42:33.611 --> 01:42:34.444
uh,

3723
01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:36.100
I don't know.

3724
01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:37.990
So then all of a sudden we go to trial,

3725
01:42:37.991 --> 01:42:42.640
we started trial and then he doesn't give us the information,

3726
01:42:42.641 --> 01:42:47.290
but what he does is he started to ask questions through my lawyer and then he

3727
01:42:47.291 --> 01:42:49.240
starts to talk about Ronald Reagan and

3728
01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:55.870
Enrique Remu Tez and the Nicaraguan contras.

3729
01:42:55.871 --> 01:42:57.850
And I'm like the Nicaraguan contras,

3730
01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:00.220
what's going on this?

3731
01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:01.780
So I go back to my cell,

3732
01:43:01.781 --> 01:43:02.650
I started studying,

3733
01:43:02.890 --> 01:43:03.850
what was the contrast,

3734
01:43:03.851 --> 01:43:04.301
you know,

3735
01:43:04.301 --> 01:43:05.134
who is,

3736
01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:05.890
uh,

3737
01:43:05.890 --> 01:43:07.290
Enrique re mute is and,

3738
01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:08.620
and the whole nine yards.

3739
01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:09.730
He still doesn't tell me.

3740
01:43:10.330 --> 01:43:14.770
I don't find out the whole scoop until his newspaper drop when his newspaper

3741
01:43:14.771 --> 01:43:19.771
dropping the San Jose Mercury News and I'm on the front cover and it says that

3742
01:43:20.201 --> 01:43:22.530
the CIA backed army,

3743
01:43:22.531 --> 01:43:23.020
uh,

3744
01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:24.070
was selling drugs to me,

3745
01:43:24.071 --> 01:43:24.761
which they was,

3746
01:43:24.761 --> 01:43:25.290
I knew,

3747
01:43:25.290 --> 01:43:25.510
you know,

3748
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:26.291
I knew blend dawn,

3749
01:43:26.291 --> 01:43:28.930
but I didn't know he was working with the CIA.

3750
01:43:28.990 --> 01:43:29.650
I mean like,

3751
01:43:29.650 --> 01:43:30.880
damn the guy I'm working with,

3752
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:32.410
you should have told me we couldn't really,

3753
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:34.540
we couldn't really got it in.

3754
01:43:34.541 --> 01:43:35.374
Right.

3755
01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:35.981
So,

3756
01:43:35.981 --> 01:43:36.814
uh,

3757
01:43:37.090 --> 01:43:39.520
that's when I first found out that was my first,

3758
01:43:39.610 --> 01:43:41.110
I had an in a lot of people,

3759
01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:41.411
you know,

3760
01:43:41.411 --> 01:43:43.570
they don't believe me when I tell them that I had no knowledge,

3761
01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:47.140
but I had absolutely no knowledge that he was a CIA operative.

3762
01:43:47.250 --> 01:43:50.040
<v 1>It's crazy that the people that busted you were not aware of your whole</v>

3763
01:43:50.041 --> 01:43:50.874
situation.

3764
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.250
There were not aware

3765
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:53.470
<v 6>of who you are making money for.</v>

3766
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:54.450
<v 7>No.</v>

3767
01:43:54.450 --> 01:43:55.283
Well,

3768
01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:59.980
<v 6>so that just shows you how much chaos is in that whole world of,</v>

3769
01:43:59.981 --> 01:44:01.560
of black ops w you know,

3770
01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:03.470
drug that drug businessman.

3771
01:44:03.471 --> 01:44:03.801
It's,

3772
01:44:03.801 --> 01:44:04.580
it's,

3773
01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:05.210
it's so

3774
01:44:05.210 --> 01:44:05.750
<v 7>big,</v>

3775
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:06.583
you know,

3776
01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:07.120
in,

3777
01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:08.900
and I'm not just saying from the street level,

3778
01:44:08.901 --> 01:44:10.080
but from,

3779
01:44:10.190 --> 01:44:11.000
for Dea,

3780
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:11.421
you know,

3781
01:44:11.421 --> 01:44:11.960
uh,

3782
01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:14.630
I watched the documentary about two weeks ago.

3783
01:44:14.631 --> 01:44:19.631
I spoke at a church in Compton and they had some cops on there and we're saying

3784
01:44:20.661 --> 01:44:25.661
that these cops wouldn't investigate homicides because you could get a better

3785
01:44:27.441 --> 01:44:30.860
promotion by investigating drugs if you want to,

3786
01:44:30.861 --> 01:44:33.020
if you want to go and be the captain of the station,

3787
01:44:33.290 --> 01:44:35.060
you don't go to homicide.

3788
01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:37.130
If you on homicide,

3789
01:44:37.131 --> 01:44:41.270
you want to switch to drug enforcement because that's where they were given all

3790
01:44:41.271 --> 01:44:41.930
the promotions.

3791
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:45.200
<v 6>To tie up that story for the folks who don't know the story or listening to this</v>

3792
01:44:45.201 --> 01:44:46.034
for the first time,

3793
01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:49.040
what he was saying was that while he was selling drugs,

3794
01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:52.160
hit the money that he was earning,

3795
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:53.540
whether they're selling the drugs,

3796
01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:57.020
the drugs were actually coming from the CIA,

3797
01:44:57.021 --> 01:44:59.450
which was using that money to fund the Contra,

3798
01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:00.051
uh,

3799
01:45:00.051 --> 01:45:03.920
army against the Sandinistas that was backed by Reagan.

3800
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.480
Yeah.

3801
01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:07.640
Reagan over and all that stuff that was on trial.

3802
01:45:07.641 --> 01:45:11.330
The Iran Contra trials that Oliver North United I live in north might be coming

3803
01:45:11.331 --> 01:45:12.950
out and speaking now real.

3804
01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:14.360
That's what you should get on this show.

3805
01:45:14.361 --> 01:45:18.040
Really speaking about what he's going to tell the truth about everything.

3806
01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:18.950
He's Finna come clean.

3807
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:20.150
A lot of the guys

3808
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.600
<v 7>media,</v>

3809
01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:22.240
he's doing a documentary and uh,

3810
01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:23.153
uh,

3811
01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:26.000
one of the producers were saying that he's interested in having me in his

3812
01:45:26.001 --> 01:45:26.560
documentary.

3813
01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:27.490
<v 6>Oh my God.</v>

3814
01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:28.510
So you already know it.

3815
01:45:28.511 --> 01:45:29.140
I'm going to tell him.

3816
01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:29.973
Yeah,

3817
01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:30.250
yeah.

3818
01:45:30.250 --> 01:45:31.083
You're going to be in it.

3819
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:34.890
How do you not sit down and tell your story to that guy?

3820
01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:36.490
That's a fascinating situation.

3821
01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:36.731
Yeah.

3822
01:45:36.731 --> 01:45:38.530
So I mean that would be the last link.

3823
01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:40.120
So he was the guy that,

3824
01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:42.520
he was a big part of the organization of the whole thing,

3825
01:45:42.521 --> 01:45:42.731
right?

3826
01:45:42.731 --> 01:45:43.564
He was the guy

3827
01:45:43.710 --> 01:45:46.190
<v 7>did that dealt with the White House,</v>

3828
01:45:46.191 --> 01:45:46.581
you know,

3829
01:45:46.581 --> 01:45:47.930
it stopped it out of the north.

3830
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.690
Wow.

3831
01:45:48.690 --> 01:45:48.921
You know,

3832
01:45:48.921 --> 01:45:50.480
it didn't go to Bush in,

3833
01:45:50.481 --> 01:45:50.781
in,

3834
01:45:50.781 --> 01:45:51.081
in,

3835
01:45:51.081 --> 01:45:51.914
in Reagan,

3836
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:53.510
out of a north stopped it at him.

3837
01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:55.480
<v 6>I used to have an Ollie north for president t shirt.</v>

3838
01:45:56.230 --> 01:45:57.280
I didn't even know the story.

3839
01:45:57.281 --> 01:45:58.850
I was like fucking 16 or southern.

3840
01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:00.160
I'd thought he was a bad motherfucker.

3841
01:46:00.730 --> 01:46:00.971
I mean,

3842
01:46:00.971 --> 01:46:01.271
you know,

3843
01:46:01.271 --> 01:46:02.400
he was trying to say to congeal.

3844
01:46:02.710 --> 01:46:03.250
Yeah.

3845
01:46:03.250 --> 01:46:04.580
The idea behind it though,

3846
01:46:04.581 --> 01:46:06.430
it was fascinating the way they chose to do it.

3847
01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:11.880
It's just shows you that that is the most ridiculous conspiracy theory you could

3848
01:46:11.891 --> 01:46:12.724
ever come up with.

3849
01:46:12.850 --> 01:46:17.850
The CIA's selling drugs in the ghetto and then they using that money to fund

3850
01:46:18.311 --> 01:46:19.131
illegal wars.

3851
01:46:19.131 --> 01:46:19.361
You know,

3852
01:46:19.361 --> 01:46:20.170
it's crazy.

3853
01:46:20.170 --> 01:46:23.350
How do I keep getting mixed up in these types of situations?

3854
01:46:23.351 --> 01:46:23.531
Right.

3855
01:46:23.531 --> 01:46:25.450
I got the craziest rapper in the world.

3856
01:46:25.630 --> 01:46:26.463
Right.

3857
01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.060
You've had an interesting life of my friend.

3858
01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:31.480
Take my name and then I was involved with [inaudible].

3859
01:46:31.730 --> 01:46:32.470
Yeah.

3860
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:35.740
I mean that is one of the craziest drug stories ever.

3861
01:46:35.741 --> 01:46:38.380
And the fact that you got out of it completely unscathed.

3862
01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:38.741
I mean,

3863
01:46:38.741 --> 01:46:41.750
how many dudes are even still alive that you were in business with 20 years?

3864
01:46:41.751 --> 01:46:42.820
A lot of my friends are dead.

3865
01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:43.751
It must be right.

3866
01:46:43.751 --> 01:46:45.200
A lot of friends are dead still in

3867
01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:46.520
<v 7>prison with life sentences.</v>

3868
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:47.490
Wow.

3869
01:46:47.490 --> 01:46:48.323
Um,

3870
01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:49.020
and,

3871
01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:49.591
and you know,

3872
01:46:49.591 --> 01:46:50.590
one of my goals is to,

3873
01:46:50.591 --> 01:46:50.780
to,

3874
01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:53.010
to change those laws and bring those guys home.

3875
01:46:53.011 --> 01:46:53.730
Because,

3876
01:46:53.730 --> 01:46:54.001
you know,

3877
01:46:54.001 --> 01:46:55.920
I don't think a guy should do 30 years.

3878
01:46:56.130 --> 01:46:57.210
He didn't kill anybody.

3879
01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:57.761
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

3880
01:46:57.761 --> 01:46:58.391
I agree with you.

3881
01:46:58.391 --> 01:46:59.350
100%.

3882
01:46:59.490 --> 01:47:03.520
[inaudible] and more so I think that we need to reevaluate what's legal and

3883
01:47:03.521 --> 01:47:05.560
illegal in this country because we got a,

3884
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:06.130
we have a,

3885
01:47:06.130 --> 01:47:10.180
a corrupt series of politicians that have been bought off and I've put a bunch

3886
01:47:10.181 --> 01:47:13.780
of laws in place and have allowed people to sell all kinds of shit that kills

3887
01:47:13.781 --> 01:47:15.060
people all the time.

3888
01:47:15.140 --> 01:47:18.590
<v 7>People voted to let them make marijuana legal and they still won't.</v>

3889
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.300
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

3890
01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:21.040
they voted to make it medically legal.

3891
01:47:21.041 --> 01:47:22.000
It's even the legal,

3892
01:47:22.001 --> 01:47:25.660
the legality of it statewide in Colorado and Washington State's coming to

3893
01:47:25.661 --> 01:47:26.590
question federally,

3894
01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:27.151
you know,

3895
01:47:27.151 --> 01:47:27.310
like,

3896
01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:27.640
I mean,

3897
01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:31.300
there's a bunch of gangsters run this country and they're not nice people and a

3898
01:47:31.301 --> 01:47:33.940
lot of the shit they're doing is stupid and it's unnecessary.

3899
01:47:33.941 --> 01:47:34.840
And you know,

3900
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:37.000
we want a government,

3901
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:38.500
we want a police force,

3902
01:47:38.501 --> 01:47:39.940
we want a fire department,

3903
01:47:39.941 --> 01:47:41.290
we want a president.

3904
01:47:41.291 --> 01:47:42.340
We want all that shit.

3905
01:47:42.610 --> 01:47:45.670
We just don't want the corruption that comes with it almost inevitably.

3906
01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:47.530
And it's unfortunate,

3907
01:47:47.531 --> 01:47:52.531
but your story is a perfect example of how fucked the whole system is.

3908
01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:58.950
The fact that the CIA was absolutely selling drugs,

3909
01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:01.913
<v 7>right?</v>

3910
01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:02.873
I mean,

3911
01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:04.710
they were selling it through you.

3912
01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:05.670
You're the guy.

3913
01:48:06.810 --> 01:48:11.430
I can't say that they wasn't actually selling it themselves.

3914
01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:13.710
It was their operatives that was selling it.

3915
01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.360
So these guys,

3916
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:18.370
they made it very clear what this guy was in the agency.

3917
01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:19.141
Yeah.

3918
01:48:19.141 --> 01:48:20.270
He wasn't an Asian.

3919
01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:20.470
Well,

3920
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:21.090
that's how they're making it.

3921
01:48:21.090 --> 01:48:22.170
He was just on our payroll.

3922
01:48:22.590 --> 01:48:23.430
Since the difference,

3923
01:48:23.490 --> 01:48:25.830
I guess you can be on the payroll.

3924
01:48:25.831 --> 01:48:27.180
You can get a check from the CIA,

3925
01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:28.650
but you're not a CIA agent.

3926
01:48:28.690 --> 01:48:29.130
Yeah.

3927
01:48:29.130 --> 01:48:29.960
It's not without,

3928
01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:31.170
he's not CIA.

3929
01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:32.020
He's just CIA.

3930
01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:35.321
<v 1>It's a,</v>

3931
01:48:35.321 --> 01:48:36.610
it's a fucked up world.

3932
01:48:36.670 --> 01:48:40.600
I had hoped that when Obama got in and he represented something different and

3933
01:48:40.601 --> 01:48:41.231
maybe he does,

3934
01:48:41.231 --> 01:48:41.831
maybe it's just,

3935
01:48:41.831 --> 01:48:42.910
it's so hard to change.

3936
01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:47.440
It takes a long fucking time to turn anything microphone and was fell.

3937
01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:48.230
Oh,

3938
01:48:48.230 --> 01:48:50.500
it takes a long fucking time to turn anything around,

3939
01:48:50.501 --> 01:48:51.490
but it's,

3940
01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:52.981
<v 7>I want to find out,</v>

3941
01:48:52.981 --> 01:48:54.360
is he going to do anything for the hood?

3942
01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:55.310
Well,

3943
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:55.660
no,

3944
01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:56.461
it was the time.

3945
01:48:56.461 --> 01:48:56.701
Right.

3946
01:48:56.701 --> 01:48:57.840
He's got reelected.

3947
01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:58.501
Exactly.

3948
01:48:58.501 --> 01:48:58.651
And,

3949
01:48:58.651 --> 01:48:58.951
and they,

3950
01:48:58.951 --> 01:49:00.000
and they voted him in,

3951
01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:00.661
you know,

3952
01:49:00.661 --> 01:49:02.310
the hood came out and they don't vote.

3953
01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:02.700
Right.

3954
01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:03.240
Yeah.

3955
01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:04.500
Well they came out for Obama.

3956
01:49:04.590 --> 01:49:05.070
Yeah.

3957
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:05.850
Twice.

3958
01:49:05.850 --> 01:49:06.270
Yeah.

3959
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:06.601
So,

3960
01:49:06.601 --> 01:49:07.100
you know,

3961
01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:07.891
we are hoping that,

3962
01:49:07.891 --> 01:49:08.190
uh,

3963
01:49:08.190 --> 01:49:08.471
did he,

3964
01:49:08.471 --> 01:49:08.850
uh,

3965
01:49:08.850 --> 01:49:09.151
you know,

3966
01:49:09.151 --> 01:49:10.170
take this time and,

3967
01:49:10.171 --> 01:49:10.530
and,

3968
01:49:10.530 --> 01:49:11.071
and do something,

3969
01:49:11.071 --> 01:49:12.300
put some programs in the hood.

3970
01:49:12.690 --> 01:49:13.140
Yeah.

3971
01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:13.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3972
01:49:13.710 --> 01:49:14.251
Like I said,

3973
01:49:14.251 --> 01:49:18.390
one 10th of what's used to blow up other countries could change everything

3974
01:49:18.391 --> 01:49:19.224
radically.

3975
01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:20.091
We could have a,

3976
01:49:20.091 --> 01:49:24.300
an incredible nation if we started focusing our resources on,

3977
01:49:24.330 --> 01:49:25.440
on putting money.

3978
01:49:25.441 --> 01:49:25.800
I mean,

3979
01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:26.430
it's,

3980
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:31.200
we spend so much money in rehabilitating cities after we invade them.

3981
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.830
You know,

3982
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:33.330
how much money did we spend in Iraq?

3983
01:49:33.331 --> 01:49:35.590
How much money as a Halliburton made?

3984
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:37.030
How much fun

3985
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.761
<v 7>then what they do it,</v>

3986
01:49:37.761 --> 01:49:38.594
all the money.

3987
01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:39.860
I don't know.
