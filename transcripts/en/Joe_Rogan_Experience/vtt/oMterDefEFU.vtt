Are we live.

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:04.111
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:04.321
Sweet.

4
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:05.040
Jesus.

5
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.671
Are we live?

6
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:06.504
Brian,

7
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.190
this is real powerful,

8
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:08.431
Greg.

9
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:08.731
Proops.

10
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:09.660
Thanks for doing this man.

11
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.560
Really appreciate it.

12
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.401
It's a pleasure,

13
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:11.910
Jo.

14
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.271
Pleasure.

15
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:12.481
See you,

16
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:12.990
sir.

17
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.720
Before we do this,

18
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.300

I.

22
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.301
T.

23
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:19.380
This is a short podcast.

24
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:20.850
I'll keep this brief as fuck.

25
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.350
Go get yourself some Alpha brain.

26
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:23.310
Some good gigs.

27
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.430
Help some brain vitamins and some shroom tech for your endurance,

28
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.600
which might socks,

29
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:27.810
right?

30
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.991
No,

31
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:29.160
it's fucking depressing.

32
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.470
I'm bringing a care package of,

33
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.200
uh,

34
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.420
on it to Mike Maxwell and San Diego tonight.

35
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.901
Nice.

36
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:34.480
We're always worried.

37
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.891
I don't know if he's,

38
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:35.580
he's struggling.

39
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.590
He drew a picture of me.

40
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.890
It's first to look at the shirt.

41
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:38.011
Yeah.

42
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:38.910
Mike Maxwell shirt.

43
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.661
This is the new,

44
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:41.430
a higher prime rate design that Mike's Mike,

45
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.360
Mike Maxwell did.

46
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.560
I'm a fucking wicked.

47
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.730
I'm addicted to his,

48
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:45.564
his artwork.

49
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.030
He's a very good artist and he's a very cool guy too.

50
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.980
Um,

51
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.380
uh,

52
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.213
he's uh,

53
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.600
gone with us on the road.

54
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.450
That's you.

55
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.070
Isn't that crazy?

56
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.311
Yeah,

57
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:54.180
he's really good.

58
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.171
And again,

59
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:55.561
like I said,

60
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:56.460
a great guy too.

61
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.543
Yeah.

62
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.530
Anyway.

63
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.950
Uh,

64
00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.191
good.

65
00:00:59.191 --> 00:00:59.820
Get them some,

66
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.720
some Alpha brain,

67
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.643
all that good shit.

68
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.750
Whatever you,

69
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:04.584
um,

70
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.970
you,

71
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.120
you do with your health,

72
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.023
uh,

73
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.040
the most important things.

74
00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:08.760
You're dying.

75
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.361
You know what I mean?

76
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:12.700
It sounds like silly to preach that because everybody sort of should know what

77
00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:13.770
at this stage of the life.

78
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.570
But you know,

79
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.570
eating healthy food will make a huge impact on the way your body feels.

80
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.830
It's,

81
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.890
it's just a fact.

82
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.701
It just,

83
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:23.460
we take it for granted cause other food is delicious.

84
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.070
Kentucky Fried Chicken fucking taste awesome.

85
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.380
But it's not that good for you.

86
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.060
And if you eat healthy and you,

87
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.570
especially if you supplement nutrients along with eating healthy,

88
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.160
your body will work better.

89
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.420
Your brain will work better.

90
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:37.320
It's a fact.

91
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.970
There's science behind it.

92
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.300
And the science behind Alpha brain is isolating all the nutrients that are

93
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:44.520
responsible for cognitive function.

94
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.820
All of the nutrients that stimulate your brain's production of all the good shit

95
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:53.940
that it needs to think good in scientific terms.

96
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.620
All of it is explained that on a.com if you your first 30 pills,

97
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:01.290
the by there's a 100% money back guarantee,

98
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:04.500
you don't have to even return the product to just say,

99
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:06.060
this shit didn't do anything for me.

100
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.350
No one's trying to rip you off.

101
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:10.440
We're just trying to need to sell you the best vitamins and nutrients and

102

00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:15.780

104
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.500

105
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:19.890

106

um,

107
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.690
blending like Kale shakes and stuff like that and we sell them for a $200 less

108
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:25.800
than the manufactured,

109
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.490
uh,

110
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.930
retail suggested price.

111
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.490
Uh,

112
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.670
we,

113
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.290

115
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:37.440
reasonable price as possible.

116
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.821
This,

117
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:39.450
um,

118
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.283

so I,

122
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.083
uh,

123
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.390
it's very important to me if the,

124
00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:48.750
anything that we get involved with,

125
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.920
whether it's on it or teaching or whether it's audible.com.

126
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.320
It's all products that we believe in.

127
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.990
And if you go to on a.com use the code named Rogan.

<v 1>supplements for men.</v>

130
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.080
All right,

131
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.913
I'm done.

132
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.680
It's not supplements from any

133
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.050
experience.

134
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.191
Powerful Greg.

135
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:16.024
Proops

136
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.590
dude,

137
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.341
great to see you man.

138
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:19.810
Thank you very much for coming down and doing this.

139
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.710
Awesome to be here.

140
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:21.190
Joe,

141
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.630
you said the dickens before.

142
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:25.960
You're the only person I even know that can say the Dickens and it towns.

143
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.010
It sounds perfect.

144
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.020
It fit right in there.

145
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.150
It meant to be said that way.

146
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.350
The Dickens.

147
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.260
I'm as loud as the Dickens.

148
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.320
Nobody's the dickens anymore and it's a quite a good one.

149
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:39.190
It's got chicken it,

150
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:42.160
which makes it king right off the tip.

151
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.930
And then you could sneak dick in.

152
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.340
Exactly here.

153
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.630
It's like showing bunt and swinging away as Dickins cause it comes back on you

154
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.600
really if you said,

155
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.250
if you say to someone you know loud as the Dickens,

156
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:57.430
they can't say anything like you'd say that to your grandmother and children.

157
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.540
That's amazing.

158
00:03:58.541 --> 00:03:59.500
You Little Dickens.

159
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.120
That's so strange.

160
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.681
It's weird.

161
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:05.590
It's with this certain sounds that are like super offensive.

162
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:06.640
And if you sneak one out,

163
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.560
I mean we still agree to that.

164
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.680
It's so preposterous isn't it?

165
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:13.510
It's so fucking silly.

166
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.410
And why grant words that much demand and over your emotions and stuff,

167
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:21.430
like just the trigger of a sound is enough to make you fucking lose your shit

168
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:23.410
and like protest or write a letter.

169
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.750
Yeah.

170
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.131
It's like,

171
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:28.870
well we were almost agreeing that the heights that you could reach at your

172
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:29.381
worst,

173
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:33.040
at your nastiest to the way you feel about someone is not really reached with

174
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:33.880
regular language.

175
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:38.170
We have to reserve those extreme moments for one extreme word.

176
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:39.070
And if we don't do that,

177
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:42.760
we're never going to adequately portray how fucking mad we are.

178
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.660
True.

179
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.310
So if you use it too much,

180
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.810
I guess that's what's going on.

181
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.180
I'm guilty of that as much as any other comic.

182
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:52.600
I'm profane and I will say fuck too many times though,

183
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:54.490
during the setting of a nightclub,

184
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.080
how many act it's,

185
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:56.950
that's when you're,

186
00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:59.680
you're having a few drinks or unwinding and you're like,

187
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:01.030
fuck this man.

188
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.800
That's where it's supposed to come out.

189
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.663
I think so too.

190
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.190
And I'm,

191
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.080
and that I had to do like a classy Gig in Chicago couple years ago.

192
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.940
I was playing at xannies and they go,

193
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:10.691
do you want to do this?

194
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:12.030
A Chicago Theater Gig?

195
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.180
Then,

196
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.510
you know,

197
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.610
the trip puts it on a Steadman is going to be there.

198
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.091
And,

199
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:16.420
uh,

200
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.710
what's his name from sticks,

201
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.903
you know,

202
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.180
a fucking Dennis right from sticks,

203
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.651
sticks.

204
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:25.120
But there you remember sticks.

205
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.080
I do remember them.

206
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:26.914
I can't remember what it,

207
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.900
that demo to.

208
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.960
Got To this.

209
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:29.680
And then they did.

210
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.513
Oh Wow.

211
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.820
[inaudible]

212
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.023
sticks.

213
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.420
The did shows up from steaks.

214
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.660
Has a fantastic,

215
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.790
used the word preposterous.

216
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:41.710
And minute ago he had a preposterous wife.

217
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.830
His wife was wearing a bubblegum pink and had a funny,

218
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.050
Penelope pitched up the hairdo and giant lips and airlines and was,

219
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.170
was like a delightful cartoon of what a rock star's wife would be in a conflict,

220
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:54.491
you know,

221
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:55.180
like,

222
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.560
like in a picture and a cartoon.

223
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.110
And,

224
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.410
um,

225
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.951
he was cool,

226
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:58.131
you know,

227
00:05:58.131 --> 00:05:58.964
he looked good and,

228
00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.810
uh,

229
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.980
I would get into there to do it.

230
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:03.770
And I'm being interviewed by the theater critic from the Tribune.

231
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:04.011
Right.

232
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:04.844
As an artist.

233
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.481
Right?

234
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:05.960
Because they're,

235
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.380
you know,

236
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.220
is the newspaper that,

237
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.120
so,

238
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.450
you know,

239
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.901
Joe Rogan,

240
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:09.650
let's talk about Jonathan,

241
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.861
you know,

242
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:10.630
it's not,

243
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.160
and it's polite company and then I have to do five.

244
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.640
And I realize as I looked through my act frantically outside,

245
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.150
I am profane in every set up,

246
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:24.890
every I'm going to have to calculatedly bank and work really hard to remove the

247
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:26.750
profane from every single line.

248
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.880
And then of course I did it and I probably,

249
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:29.870
I don't think I slipped,

250
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:34.280
but I get a joke about a bomb or something and they were a little more rich than

251
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:35.240
that at one point.

252
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:40.241
And I wanted that jokes really funny if you're blue collar and then they laughed

253
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:44.780
at the acknowledgement that that's gotta suck man.

254
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:48.800
That feeling well there was a nice crowd and I thought I'm an intelligent act,

255
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.521
you know what I mean?

256
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:50.420
I'd be ready to tight.

257
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.670
Why can't I leave five minutes of philosophy on these fuckers instead?

258
00:06:53.671 --> 00:06:54.140
I,

259
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.980
Oh shit.

260
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.780
You know when you go to the fucking thing,

261
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.291
you know,

262
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.900
like you think really that's,

263
00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.450
yeah.

264
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.110
Yes.

265
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.040
Cause I'm playing a club.

266
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.140
That's why I can't do anything other than the stand up.

267
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.450
Like I won't do standup in any other form.

268
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:09.980
I don't want to do it on a talk show.

269
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.813
I don't want to do it.

270
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.420
It's just doesn't seem like that.

271
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.550
Although I appreciate there's a different art form to crafting a really nice

272
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:19.040
seven minutes sat for like a tonight show set or something like that.

273
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:21.980
But I mean I know a lot of guys were awesome at that for me.

274
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:22.461
I can't,

275
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:23.030
I can't,

276
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.410
it doesn't represent me.

277
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.850
It doesn't represent.

278
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.070
I think it's fantastic that you have that point of view.

279
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.010
I've done them over the years and it's never the best way.

280
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:33.380
I'm on TV it for four minutes.

281
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:34.520
I think I'm perplexing.

282
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.331
You know what I mean?

283
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:35.900
Like what,

284
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.490
why?

285
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.370
Well I think it was,

286
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:41.120
it's an awesome opportunity for comics to get seen and for the longest time it

287
00:07:41.121 --> 00:07:42.080
was like the best one.

288
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:46.390
Like if you could get on Carson and Carson have you come down,

289
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.510
sit next to him on the couch,

290
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:49.040
like you are a fucking winner man.

291
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.140
And those who could attack comedy clubs from that.

292
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.820
But this is sort of a different time and now it's a very limiting thing and it

293
00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:56.720
seems silly.

294
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.170
It seems the whole pageantry of it seems silly.

295
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:05.030
The band playing when people walk out and sit down and this weird conversation

296
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:06.140
in front of people.

297
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:06.411
I mean,

298
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:07.970
I know I enjoy doing them,

299
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.370
but they're an odd art form.

300
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.500
There's an odd fakery weirdness to the whole thing that's not necessary.

301
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.040
Well,

302
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.930
there's a almost a fifties in this about it.

303
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:19.820
It's one of the first TV shows,

304
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:20.654
you know,

305
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.830
because uh,

306
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.580
I don't know that there were lots of famous chat shows on the radio.

307
00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:26.391
There was lots of humans,

308
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:28.040
variety shows and every other kind of show.

309
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:31.250
But I don't remember hearing about ones where people sat around and talked.

310
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:35.420
It seems to be a function of television because it's so cool as they say right

311
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.350
that year because you're kicked back in detached and watching it and you can sit

312
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:40.280
and watch people just go,

313
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:40.701
blah,

314
00:08:40.701 --> 00:08:41.061
blah,

315
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:41.331
blah,

316
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:42.164
my book,

317
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:42.431
blah,

318
00:08:42.431 --> 00:08:42.641
blah,

319
00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:42.861
blah.

320
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:43.830
We shot a movie in Ireland.

321
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:44.840
It was really hard.

322
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.970
And that's entertainment,

323
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:47.804
but it hasn't been,

324
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.621
didn't like,

325
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:49.190
I don't know.

326
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.430
I would say Steve Allen kind of pioneered making it a thing on TV,

327
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:55.800
that exact format with the band and comics and sketches and you know,

328
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.580
yeah.

329
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.210
<v 2>Uh,</v>

330
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.290
and they've just stuck to it,

331
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:58.841
you know what I mean?

332
00:08:58.841 --> 00:09:00.720
Then it's variations with any theme.

333
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.010
Everybody's done one,

334
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.690
but like you say,

335
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:06.690
it's funny like you in your show when you come on,

336
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.090
maybe there's music ms song you like or whatever.

337
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:10.890
Like we have theme songs for our shows,

338
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:11.540
uh,

339
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.480
on the podcast,

340
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.370
but when you'd come on on TV and they put a little butter,

341
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.370
pat and Bob,

342
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.453
Bob,

343
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.121
Bob,

344
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:18.541
Bob,

345
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:18.811
Bob,

346
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:19.830
Joe Rogan,

347
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:21.140
he's going to be playing test case.

348
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.730
Yeah.

349
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.380
And Omaha.

350
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:22.741
Yeah.

351
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:23.251
You're like,

352
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:23.820
really?

353
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.480
Okay,

354
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.590
this is big.

355
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.610
This is,

356
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.630
I should have shined my shoes.

357
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:30.571
Yeah.

358
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:34.170
What is that Hokey fake thing that we do with that?

359
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.950
The hokey fake thing political guys do when they give speeches.

360
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.280
Yeah.

361
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.360
They'll like fake.

362
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.440
I love that though.

363
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.460
The whole pageant,

364
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:42.990
that's really old to me,

365
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:46.050
that hokey fake thing of his political speeches that now you're going back to

366
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:47.220
the dawn of Man,

367
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:47.431
right?

368
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:49.800
The first person that got up in front of everybody and went,

369
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:50.221
all right,

370
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:51.054
all right.

371
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:51.910
You know,

372
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:52.360
like I,

373
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.240
it's been a craft for so long and it's been refined in so many cultures that the

374
00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.770
idea of putting forth this,

375
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.290
I got the word selfestry thrown at me yesterday.

376
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:01.860
I don't,

377
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.281
I'm not,

378
00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:03.010
I don't kick it from,

379
00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:03.843
what is that word?

380
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.970
It means a false philosophy.

381
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:07.200
Use using big words.

382
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:10.170
Like I'll throw an idea at you and back it up with a bunch of shit,

383
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:11.100
but it's not true at all.

384
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:11.993
That's my whole life.

385
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.833
Exactly.

386
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.970
The Guy tweeted me and said,

387
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.320
cause I do definitions of my show.

388
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:19.860
Like lately I've been doing political ones like democracy and you know,

389
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.950
like let's talk about with the d and feminism and things like that.

390
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:24.360
Like people say it a lot,

391
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:25.290
you hear it a lot,

392
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.210
but not everybody knows what it actually,

393
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.110
the dif,

394
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.750
the different,

395
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.180
you know the dictionary definition,

396
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:30.471
like we're,

397
00:10:30.471 --> 00:10:31.620
we're supposed to start with it.

398
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:32.250
Right.

399
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.390
So he wrote,

400
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.350
how about selfestry?

401
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:35.011
And I wrote back,

402
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:36.000
what are you implying?

403
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:38.390
Right.

404
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.820
Just I looked it up and went,

405
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:40.890
you fucking Dick.

406
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.240
Don't,

407
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.710
don't shoot when in my heart.

408
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:44.970
That's a brutal one.

409
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.570
Yeah.

410
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:46.590
That's a clever person.

411
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.020
You could run into those clever fellows online,

412
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.040
someone,

413
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.480
and they're always waiting out there for you.

414
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:52.314
I get emails,

415
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.700
I make mistakes and my show,

416
00:10:53.701 --> 00:10:54.534
right.

417
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:55.643
And people,

418
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.630
and I read the corrections people send me,

419
00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.450
like I called Genghis Khan,

420
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:02.670
Jay Ganga [inaudible] because I'd read this book where it said it was kind of

421
00:11:02.671 --> 00:11:03.504
pronounced like that.

422
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.150
And that dude wrote me who had lived in Mongolia.

423
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.830
He broke it down and gave me the syllable by still,

424
00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:10.680
it's like Chingos,

425
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.250
Kotler,

426
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.083
whatever.

427
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:12.391
Oh,

428
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:14.280
he said it's more complicated,

429
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:15.960
but like Cha Ching is in like,

430
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.700
you know,

431
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.533
could chain,

432
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.220
you know,

433
00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.280
like he broke the hole and then like,

434
00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:20.461
yeah,

435
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:21.540
I lived in new lumber tour.

436
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:22.680
I taught French to the,

437
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:22.951
you know,

438
00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:23.550
or whatever.

439
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.383
Like,

440
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.920
so you never get away with anything unless they've come up with some wild

441
00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:30.600
fantasy that they've committed to an email.

442
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:32.370
It's doesn't seem like people would,

443
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.241
I trust it.

444
00:11:33.241 --> 00:11:35.280
Most people are telling me the truth.

445
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:35.890
Yeah.

446
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:36.061
I,

447
00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:36.550
uh,

448
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.980
I've,

449
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.280
I've always been fascinated by the noises that people make in their languages.

450
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.300
Like something like that.

451
00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:44.760
Like sometimes you can just common that can,

452
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.580
that can be a word and it's so,

453
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:51.720
it's so alien from the w the English way of styling words.

454
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:52.320
It's so,

455
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.153
it's so strange.

456
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.190
So many varieties

457
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.180
<v 0>all over the planet.</v>

458
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.350
That's a really psychedelic thing when you're in another country and a,

459
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.660
you're around a bunch of people and they're saying things and you don't

460
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:02.030
understand.

461
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.771
Like Japan,

462
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:07.360
Japan was very psychedelic cause you just did another your other all the time

463
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:08.230
completely.

464
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.160
And um,

465
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.160
and you don't know the key because you don't even understand one,

466
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.110
you don't know anything about their culture.

467
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.270
Their culture is completely different than ours.

468
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:17.920
It's like things that we accept.

469
00:12:17.921 --> 00:12:18.521
They don't,

470
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:18.721
it's,

471
00:12:18.721 --> 00:12:19.050
it's,

472
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:19.540
it's,

473
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.490
it's very odd walking amongst them.

474
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:22.690
It was really strange.

475
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.500
It was like,

476
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.790
oh that's a truly different culture that just sort of evolved over there.

477
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.080
Do you think it's island thing?

478
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.600
I mean certainly could have been they there,

479
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.770
but they're starting to figure out now that there was so much travel that even

480
00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:39.910
neanderthals were using boats and that they might've even been using boats

481
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:40.301
before.

482
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.730
People before homo.

483
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.690
<v 2>I ate a subscribed to that and I will,</v>

484
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.160
he furthered that theory and say that I think that all the preconceived notions

485
00:12:50.161 --> 00:12:53.010
about people not intermingling with each other and meeting each other are a

486
00:12:53.011 --> 00:12:57.030
nonsense and that people did it since people could make a boat basically.

487
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:57.720
And,

488
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.870
and that the coastlines of all the continents have risen.

489
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:01.500
They are,

490
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.270
they were lower tens of thousands of years ago and people lived in those places

491
00:13:06.271 --> 00:13:08.760
and those places are covered with water.

492
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.040
So we cannot find all the stuff that was there.

493
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.750
I know it sounding like a Kook,

494
00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:13.584
but I mean,

495
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:14.940
so we'll just cut a little water.

496
00:13:14.941 --> 00:13:19.941
And I remember Kon Tiki and all that when they took the boat from Africa to

497
00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:21.540
South America to prove you could do it,

498
00:13:21.541 --> 00:13:21.751
you know,

499
00:13:21.751 --> 00:13:24.840
they need to read about in like Egypt and they throw hide.

500
00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:27.390
I'll sale that to South America a few times.

501
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.930
But when you think about like even the conquistadores or whatever,

502
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.340
those little caravels their aunt or whatever,

503
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:34.320
or not that sea worthy,

504
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.380
and in about three or four weeks they would make it and then they kind of,

505
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.160
you know,

506
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.550
get in and you think if they did it,

507
00:13:41.551 --> 00:13:42.600
everybody did it.

508
00:13:42.601 --> 00:13:47.340
The Polynesians went all the way up right to all I Hawaii,

509
00:13:47.341 --> 00:13:48.850
which is not here anything.

510
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.730
The trade winds blow to it.

511
00:13:50.731 --> 00:13:51.150
Right.

512
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.750
So that they could,

513
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:52.411
they took the trade,

514
00:13:52.411 --> 00:13:57.411
went in and they gathered water on sales right at night with a gourd underneath

515
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.860
it dripped down and that's when they got fresh water on the road.

516
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.870
Oh my God.

517
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:05.250
And they brought pigs and whatnot.

518
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.450
Jesus Crunchyroll Catamaran.

519
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.710
What a fucking crazy experience that must've been.

520
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.120
Those people had balls you want to talk about balled.

521
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.900
She lost a lot of people on the way.

522
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.210
It took a while to get that established.

523
00:14:18.211 --> 00:14:18.511
Yeah.

524
00:14:18.511 --> 00:14:20.580
You couldn't just get that the first shot.

525
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.050
You're going to fuck that up.

526
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:27.430
Someone's going to die of thirst the first time the sun's gonna kill him or her

527
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.650
boat tips over.

528
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.770
There's a squad because it's the south.

529
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.350
It's the Pacific South Pacific man.

530
00:14:34.351 --> 00:14:34.531
This,

531
00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:35.840
the squall is stolen.

532
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:36.690
His fucking,

533
00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.570
I've seen some fucking crazy storms in Hawaii.

534
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.613
Yeah,

535
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.200
because you know I was in New Zealand and the Maoris came down there and wiped

536
00:14:46.201 --> 00:14:49.200
out whatever was there before them in the Middle Ages and then the white people

537
00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:50.034
come up to them.

538
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.610
But they traveled extensively.

539
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.000
<v 1>I mean po and Polynesians got around town.</v>

540
00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:58.520
They're like all up in the fucking,

541
00:14:59.240 --> 00:14:59.541
yeah,

542
00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:00.470
they were crazy.

543
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:01.310
Loked out people.

544
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:03.470
They make boats out of trees.

545
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.520
Just chop a fucking tree down hall of that bitch out navigating the,

546
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:08.354
now again,

547
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.650
they need the currents.

548
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.360
They knew they could read the breeze.

549
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:12.194
You know,

550
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.540
fucking how the air tasted.

551
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.020
They must,

552
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.280
the storm had to pass that shit down from generation to generation two.

553
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.690
It's an extraordinary,

554
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:21.650
no one talks about that.

555
00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:23.390
People talk about the explorer is exploring,

556
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:24.740
which is is extraordinary.

557
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:29.770
But what are the people who settled Hawaii or any of those far flung places like

558
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.550
that is an undertaking.

559
00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.250
Fucking bad.

560
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.680
Asses what fucking incredible bad acids.

561
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.910
That's why Hawaiians,

562
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:38.744
it's so tough.

563
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:39.051
Yeah.

564
00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:40.190
They are like Hawaiian,

565
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:44.420
like Hawaii is one of the last places where people have like regular street

566
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:45.254
fights.

567
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.630
They filmed them all the time in Hawaii.

568
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.450
People you,

569
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.030
you see fights in like a restaurant.

570
00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:50.841
You'll be sitting in.

571
00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:51.560
Two guys are like,

572
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:51.771
Hey,

573
00:15:51.771 --> 00:15:52.320
you want to nick?

574
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.500
You know they're aggressive.

575
00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:54.750
None.

576
00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:55.583
They're aggressive.

577
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.930
You have to be to get an a fucking boat and in a row out to the middle of the

578
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:02.060
ocean hoping you're going to find something.

579
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.900
Those are the most loked out people alive with your little idle on your deck

580
00:16:05.901 --> 00:16:07.220
singing songs and shit.

581
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.160
Coddling fucking casting for fish,

582
00:16:10.161 --> 00:16:10.970
right?

583
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:11.900
Trying to catch fish.

584
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.873
Gosh,

585
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.710
whole time you find a fucking island and there's no islands between Hawaii and

586
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:19.550
anything.

587
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.383
It's about what?

588
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.800
The miles from the nearest land mass 2,500 miles going.

589
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:25.860
How fast too?

590
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.450
Yes.

591
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.020
Can you even go to catch the fucking wind and you better how that your back and

592
00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:31.700
just sort of floating around out there.

593
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:36.320
You're not really going to get like any good pace going well link is it take to

594
00:16:36.321 --> 00:16:37.760
get a sailboat across the,

595
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.230
like the modern sail boats that can do it fairly quick.

596
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.590
I'm reading this Columbus Book to be the complete board about it and he,

597
00:16:43.591 --> 00:16:47.450
they said he got over in four weeks on the last one on the fourth journey and

598
00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:52.370
like 15 though to whatever and four weeks in a care about and a fleet,

599
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:52.671
three,

600
00:16:52.671 --> 00:16:53.504
four caravels.

601
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.343
And um,

602
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.011
he,

603
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:55.844
uh,

604
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:56.980
the,

605
00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.980
the author says a sailor today would be hard pressed to make that kind of time.

606
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.680
Like he's made time because that thing they said about Columbus for all of his

607
00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:07.510
shortcomings and,

608
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.480
and you know,

609
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:09.620
his ego,

610
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:10.670
uh,

611
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.550
he could dead rec in like nobody in the business.

612
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:15.560
Like he didn't use instruments,

613
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:19.030
instruments apparent according to this author fucking that he'd take out the sex

614
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.240
and he couldn't do a good reading.

615
00:17:20.241 --> 00:17:20.840
And like,

616
00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:25.220
then he'd go like north by north and they'd fucking wall.

617
00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:25.730
They catch him,

618
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.911
you know,

619
00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:27.230
like he was that navigator.

620
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.680
He found thousands of islands in the Caribbean.

621
00:17:30.681 --> 00:17:32.480
Like he found every island in the Caribbean.

622
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.833
Yeah.

623
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.340
Wow.

624
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:34.760
Yes.

625
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.170
Just by fucking sailing every night to a different place like he was that,

626
00:17:39.171 --> 00:17:41.050
how much do we know about the,

627
00:17:41.051 --> 00:17:44.080
the accuracy of the horrible things that were said about them.

628
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.721
Like the,

629
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:45.830
the most recent stuff,

630
00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:47.120
like when we were in high school,

631
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.030
we never really heard anything bad about Columbus service

632
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.521
<v 2>missions.</v>

633
00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:51.650
But then I,

634
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.640
when I was in college,

635
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:56.200
I had heard something about there,

636
00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:01.250
there was something about bashing babies and killing babies and all the

637
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.570
different things that they did to

638
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.180
him.

639
00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.000
You didn't want to see them around anymore.

640
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:09.721
Well,

641
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:10.240
there's that.

642
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.330
They certainly did that.

643
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.230
There's certainly that within a couple of generations they'd killed every Indian

644
00:18:15.231 --> 00:18:16.064
in the career.

645
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.150
There are no Indians in the Caribbean,

646
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.980
so they too are in South American,

647
00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:20.580
Central American.

648
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.830
They just showed up and just started ganking people.

649
00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:23.041
I mean,

650
00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:23.611
what happened?

651
00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:24.020
Did they,

652
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.853
did they,

653
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.040
did they find conflict with the native Americans or where they just touch on a

654
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:34.041
great administrator and he did was not a great empathetic reader of people.

655
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:39.260
Like his skill was that he had unshakable faith in his mission,

656
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:41.820
right?

657
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.430
But everywhere he ran into with the Indians and stuff,

658
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:44.940
it was,

659
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.080
he was contrary,

660
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:46.380
right?

661
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.930
Sometimes he was benevolent and gave them gifts other times.

662
00:18:48.931 --> 00:18:49.680
It all right,

663
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.130
everybody bring me gold and everybody has to wear a necklace to say they brought

664
00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:56.300
me into gold and you have to bring this much a month or I'm going to fucking be

665
00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:59.850
you and make you a slave to a whole island of people.

666
00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:02.280
And then for 50,000 Indians,

667
00:19:02.281 --> 00:19:04.050
by some count historical count,

668
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:04.640
uh,

669
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.620
to committed suicide rather than be under the Spaniards Dominion.

670
00:19:07.621 --> 00:19:09.510
And this is before there's even colonies.

671
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.021
There's like he,

672
00:19:10.021 --> 00:19:12.540
his calls and 50,000,

673
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:13.890
this is the beginning of it all.

674
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.551
And uh,

675
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:16.110
then they were sending them back to slaves.

676
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:16.411
I mean,

677
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:21.390
imagine though that the high point of his life is obviously at the after the

678
00:19:21.391 --> 00:19:23.090
first one that they were about to meet me,

679
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:23.670
right?

680
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.650
And they saw it in the night and he was a Dick,

681
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.600
a sailor on one of the other vessels,

682
00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:28.380
saw it first.

683
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.670
And he claimed he saw the light.

684
00:19:29.671 --> 00:19:30.390
At the same time,

685
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.300
there was a light on an island and they'd been at sea for like three or four

686
00:19:33.301 --> 00:19:35.880
weeks and the guys are kind of flipping out because no one had ever been over

687
00:19:35.881 --> 00:19:36.511
the edge of the world,

688
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:36.840
right.

689
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.591
Right there.

690
00:19:37.591 --> 00:19:40.110
The first boats that went over the edge of the world,

691
00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:41.760
like they were going west.

692
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:42.953
West,

693
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.820
west knows what the fuck.

694
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:45.361
So we don't,

695
00:19:45.361 --> 00:19:46.290
didn't we have China?

696
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.071
That's what they thought.

697
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:47.670
Right?

698
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.150
So crazy.

699
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.850
She gets back after that and then she leaves a bunch of guys there.

700
00:19:53.851 --> 00:19:55.440
I'm not kidding on the first missing leaves,

701
00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:56.770
like 40 guys in,

702
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.260
in Hispaniola.

703
00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.750
Oh my thoughts off back to Spain.

704
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.830
What happens to those guys?

705
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.820
Are they all died,

706
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.200
the Indians killed them all,

707
00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:04.920
man.

708
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.820
They started raping.

709
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.730
They started raping the women and taking guys as slaves.

710
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:09.563
They started like,

711
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.230
eh,

712
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.460
but the Vix,

713
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.370
the cultural exchange and the echo exchange begins immediately,

714
00:20:14.371 --> 00:20:15.000
right?

715
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.230
They had hammocks.

716
00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:17.310
We'd never seen a hammock.

717
00:20:17.311 --> 00:20:18.660
They'd never seen a candle.

718
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.900
They had tobacco and potatoes and tomatoes and you know,

719
00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.220
uh,

720
00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:25.651
Turkeys.

721
00:20:25.651 --> 00:20:26.730
They changed the world.

722
00:20:26.731 --> 00:20:27.001
Right?

723
00:20:27.001 --> 00:20:27.361
And,

724
00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:27.810
uh,

725
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:28.770
that we,

726
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.020
the Europeans,

727
00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:30.420
how'd you know,

728
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.200
guns and steel and pigs and disease.

729
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.170
How long did it take a,

730
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.150
after they arrived,

731
00:20:38.151 --> 00:20:39.990
before the Indians killed them all?

732
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.990
Well on that one they left them there and went back to Spain.

733
00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:46.710
So those guys just kind of had a drunk village for a while and then the Indians

734
00:20:46.711 --> 00:20:47.544
kind of got them.

735
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.110
And then there were Koreans who feels so weird.

736
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:51.160
Lake Indians,

737
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:52.060
it's such,

738
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.210
he gave them program.

739
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.570
That's the his legacy man.

740
00:20:55.571 --> 00:20:55.840
So,

741
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.660
so powerful whether he's a villain or whatever.

742
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:59.750
And of course he is the only,

743
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:00.790
obviously in some ways,

744
00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:02.800
but like if it wasn't him it would have been,

745
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.090
this is a terrible excuse,

746
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:04.810
but he,

747
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.050
someone was coming was coupled.

748
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.580
Cause within 30 years every buddy came,

749
00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:09.911
it's an,

750
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:13.360
it's crazy how much and then the Dutch and the French and then you know how much

751
00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:15.400
more gangster one part of the world was,

752
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.150
uh,

753
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:17.350
there was race baby,

754
00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.080
they were racing and it was really fun,

755
00:21:21.081 --> 00:21:26.081
like in like a Roman ideal of like for the bounty man [inaudible] for the glory

756
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.120
of the Empire in the church.

757
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:33.270
And for fucking find whatever you can and take it in our name and gifts with

758
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:34.624
Blah commissions.

759
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.690
The king and Queen of Glorious Catholic Spain,

760
00:21:37.691 --> 00:21:38.140
welcome,

761
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:38.890
you know,

762
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.360
join us.

763
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:41.380
That's what they were.

764
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.470
And then of course it always goes horribly wrong.

765
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.353
The greed,

766
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:47.770
they wanted gold.

767
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.660
Even Columbus won a gold and they want to go and there's no golden,

768
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.480
the Caribbean.

769
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.380
It was always those,

770
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.520
those scenes in the movies where a guy would ride up on a horse with a decree.

771
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.200
They did open it up and then they'd have to figure out and they killed him.

772
00:22:02.201 --> 00:22:03.460
And then we're at war.

773
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.380
What a bunch of crazy ass people.

774
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.171
It's nuts.

775
00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:09.660
And you really stop and think about that.

776
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.830
That's how the new and the old world came together.

777
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:12.970
That's what fascinates me.

778
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:13.770
I mean it's,

779
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.420
it's not so much that I think Columbus is the greatest person or road.

780
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.761
It's,

781
00:22:16.761 --> 00:22:17.594
it's the,

782
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:18.820
the exchange.

783
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.280
This is the first big moment.

784
00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:21.701
Yeah.

785
00:22:21.701 --> 00:22:22.600
The Vikings came over.

786
00:22:22.601 --> 00:22:23.260
They did.

787
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.930
And maybe even Saint Patrick,

788
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.391
who was it?

789
00:22:25.391 --> 00:22:27.520
Some Irish saint came over and a leather boat,

790
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:28.860
they said of leather boat,

791
00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:29.501
a leather.

792
00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:30.251
But from Ireland,

793
00:22:30.251 --> 00:22:30.531
cotton,

794
00:22:30.531 --> 00:22:32.380
the land and fucking hit like Canada.

795
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.340
Oh my God,

796
00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:34.720
I'll leather the vikings,

797
00:22:34.721 --> 00:22:35.554
you know,

798
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.300
cause the vikings were mad sailors.

799
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:37.721
They,

800
00:22:37.721 --> 00:22:38.141
you know,

801
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:40.810
they could have made it to North America and they made some pretty fairly

802
00:22:40.811 --> 00:22:44.380
sophisticated boats with a time and they could go rose and sales.

803
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:44.680
Right.

804
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.790
You're never bit calmed.

805
00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:50.590
You can fucking crack out the rows and Jesus glueless crafty votes.

806
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.900
The only danger is of course getting wiped out,

807
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:53.680
you know,

808
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.513
in a storm.

809
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.690
They would take them over land.

810
00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:56.860
When they did invade places they,

811
00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.420
they like dragged him into Russia and then went up to fucking bowl.

812
00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:00.640
Got of Moscow and stuff.

813
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:01.474
They,

814
00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.220
yeah,

815
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.380
the Vikings captured Paris.

816
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.120
He went up the sand.

817
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.710
Oh,

818
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:09.580
you have answered what that time Lester.

819
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.163
Yeah,

820
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:17.210
just boats full of boosters would show up big with belief systems and you know,

821
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.530
and mushrooms.

822
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.070
I was going to say that the Vikings are definitely the most psychedelic of all

823
00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:26.020
the Arab tribes.

824
00:23:26.021 --> 00:23:26.854
And uh,

825
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.080
do they know what mushroom they took?

826
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.831
Yeah,

827
00:23:29.831 --> 00:23:30.700
I'm sure they do.

828
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.451
We could look it up.

829
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:32.200
Probably.

830
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.330
I want to say that it was the Ama Nita Musky area.

831
00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:37.720
The would that one that always gets connected to religion and Santa Claus and

832
00:23:37.721 --> 00:23:38.860
all of their red and white one.

833
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.130
I want us to sound a little cap with a white top.

834
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:42.731
No,

835
00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:43.564
it's a,

836
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.890
it's a big red thing with white

837
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.270
<v 0>spots all over.</v>

838
00:23:47.271 --> 00:23:48.650
It looks like salad.

839
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:49.551
Yeah,

840
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:50.330
it's Murray brothers.

841
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:51.410
It looks like Santa Clause.

842
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:54.040
Do you know the correlation between the Amanita miscarry and saying,

843
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.921
oh,

844
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:55.754
you gotta see this?

845
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:56.780
Bryan Pope put,

846
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:57.800
just pull up Amma,

847
00:23:57.801 --> 00:24:02.801
Nita Mascara and Santa Claus just for like an image of a what the mushroom looks

848
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:04.790
like if people haven't seen it before.

849
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:10.390
It's a bright red and white and it in the eyes of many people who have examined

850
00:24:12.561 --> 00:24:12.680
it.

851
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:17.680
It represents Santa Claus and the reason why Santa Claus has this red and white

852
00:24:18.381 --> 00:24:21.240
outfit is cause that's the colors of the enemy to emanate and miscarry and

853
00:24:21.241 --> 00:24:21.800
mushroom.

854
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.510
The reason why the Christmas tree,

855
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:28.010
which is a coniferous tree has these brightly covered packages underneath it is

856
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:32.000
because these mushrooms have a microrisal relationship with these,

857
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:32.980
these trees in there.

858
00:24:32.981 --> 00:24:37.010
They look like bright packages and they show up in their bright shiny packages

859
00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:38.630
of red and white underneath the trees.

860
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.950
The way they dried them out as they would either pick them off and put them in

861
00:24:42.951 --> 00:24:44.630
the tree so they would dry in the sun,

862
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:45.880
which is just like you're waiting,

863
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:46.730
decorate the tree.

864
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.200
Or they would hang them in front of the fireplace to dry them out,

865
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:55.790
which is exactly what the stockings over the fireplace and why the fucking

866
00:24:55.791 --> 00:24:57.050
stockings are red and white.

867
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.130
That's the mushroom [inaudible].

868
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.403
Did it pull up?

869
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.710
You just had an image of it,

870
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:03.950
right,

871
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:04.783
Brian?

872
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:05.840
That's it right there.

873
00:25:05.841 --> 00:25:06.081
Yeah.

874
00:25:06.081 --> 00:25:06.590
There's,

875
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.081
there's a,

876
00:25:07.081 --> 00:25:08.390
a bunch of images.

877
00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:10.910
The older images of Santa Claus with that mushroom,

878
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:13.850
you see that the older you go when it goes,

879
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:17.630
you'd go back to like really ancient depictions of these mushrooms.

880
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:18.980
The older you go,

881
00:25:18.981 --> 00:25:23.360
the more often you see these mushrooms around elves and Christmas tree,

882
00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.520
a Christmas cards and things along those lines,

883
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.740
these mushrooms around Santa Claus.

884
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:31.010
So it was a direct connection.

885
00:25:31.011 --> 00:25:35.360
They were drawing fucking mushrooms and elves for Christmas cards.

886
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.810
So at one point in time people were still connected to this idea.

887
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.003
If they've lost it,

888
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.851
the end of Nina,

889
00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:41.380
what do you call it?

890
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.920
I'm gonna need a Mascara mushroom.

891
00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.270
There was this,

892
00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:44.511
yeah,

893
00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:45.280
there was a,

894
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.460
to be the one that vikings you're taking,

895
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:47.020
right?

896
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.060
They have the tree where shipping all that too.

897
00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.640
There was a scholar named John Marco Allegro who was one of the guys,

898
00:25:52.641 --> 00:25:52.940
um,

899
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.200
who was a decipher the dead sea scrolls and he wrote two books about it.

900
00:25:57.201 --> 00:26:01.490
One of them's called the the Dead Sea Scrolls in the Christian myth.

901
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.070
And the other one is called the sacred mushroom and the cross.

902
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:08.900
And it's all about how the entire Christian religion was based on psychedelic

903
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:13.010
mushroom eating and sex rituals and the fertility rituals.

904
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.600
Quiet right now.

905
00:26:14.601 --> 00:26:15.810
He was sex.

906
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:17.210
It was all that and mushroom.

907
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:17.971
This,

908
00:26:17.971 --> 00:26:19.940
that mushroom was on the cover of the book,

909
00:26:19.941 --> 00:26:21.230
the Amanita miscarrying mushroom.

910
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:22.530
Yeah.

911
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:23.301
That this mushroom,

912
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:27.230
like they would find out about how to use it and they would find out about how

913
00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:31.130
to prepare it and then it would give them this unbelievable psychedelic

914
00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:31.671
experience.

915
00:26:31.671 --> 00:26:34.280
So they hid all of the,

916
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:37.550
all of the ways of preparing it and finding it.

917
00:26:37.551 --> 00:26:39.890
And apparently it's a very tricky mushroom.

918
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.580
It's,

919
00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:40.871
it's,

920
00:26:40.871 --> 00:26:41.041
it,

921
00:26:41.041 --> 00:26:42.980
it's variable genetically.

922
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.561
It's variable.

923
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:44.280
Seasonally.

924
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.080
It's like it doesn't always give you the experience.

925
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.590
So you have to figure out how to find it from what,

926
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.970
what area it has.

927
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.730
Some of them will knock your Dick into the dirt.

928
00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:53.941
Right.

929
00:26:53.941 --> 00:26:55.890
And some of them do nothing but make you sweat.

930
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.641
It's a,

931
00:26:56.641 --> 00:26:57.650
it's a weird machine.

932
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.590
So the idea is that they hid all the information inside.

933
00:27:01.591 --> 00:27:02.940
These old stories

934
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:06.210
can ask a question.

935
00:27:06.211 --> 00:27:06.420
The,

936
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.190
so when you say all Christianity,

937
00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:12.000
do you mean like European Christianity where the mushroom exists or did it exist

938
00:27:12.001 --> 00:27:13.050
in the Middle East as well?

939
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:13.470
Well,

940
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:16.640
this is the Dead Sea scrolls were all found in Kumaris.

941
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.430
So that's where they were writing this stuff supposedly.

942
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:21.120
Um,

943
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:21.953
so in,

944
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.370
at least in that area,

945
00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:25.920
in Israel,

946
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.340
they were taking mushrooms according to them allegro.

947
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.250
But see allegro was the only scholar on the,

948
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:32.761
the,

949
00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:33.181
the,

950
00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:36.780
there was a list of scholars that were hired to decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls.

951
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.820
He was the only one that that was an agnostic.

952
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.100
He wasn't ordained minister.

953
00:27:41.101 --> 00:27:43.230
But then in studying theology he just said,

954
00:27:43.231 --> 00:27:43.381
well,

955
00:27:43.381 --> 00:27:44.310
this is kind of silly.

956
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:48.420
Obviously there's some you just crazy stories and let's just get to the root of

957
00:27:48.421 --> 00:27:50.550
all this and find out where this all comes from.

958
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:51.601
By chance.

959
00:27:51.601 --> 00:27:54.270
Was He also the only professor that also took mushrooms?

960
00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.760
I don't think the crazy thing is,

961
00:27:56.761 --> 00:27:57.391
I don't think he did.

962
00:27:57.391 --> 00:27:59.070
He was a really a straight laced scholar.

963
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.113
I know.

964
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.520
Get to Santa Claus jail.

965
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:02.521
Well,

966
00:28:02.521 --> 00:28:04.050
Santa Claus being,

967
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.920
how does it get all the way down to the same,

968
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.470
I understand that the colors and the tree and everything is he,

969
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.370
they always give us this bullshit story about Saint Nicholas fruits from Turkey

970
00:28:14.371 --> 00:28:15.151
and yeah,

971
00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:15.351
like,

972
00:28:15.351 --> 00:28:16.780
like Wikipedia and everything says that,

973
00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:16.951
you know,

974
00:28:16.951 --> 00:28:20.670
there's a couple of different versions and one is from Germany,

975
00:28:20.671 --> 00:28:21.504
one's from,

976
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:22.570
yeah,

977
00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.160
they're the Siberian one.

978
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:24.370
Uh,

979
00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.310
the reindeer.

980
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.700
The thing about the reindeer,

981
00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.370
one of the things about the rangers are reindeer love to eat.

982
00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:30.650
Amanita miscarry and mushrooms.

983
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.321
So much so.

984
00:28:31.321 --> 00:28:31.621
Yeah.

985
00:28:31.621 --> 00:28:34.860
So much so that when they have a shamonic rituals in the,

986
00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:35.191
the,

987
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:35.940
um,

988
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.150
sweat lodges and they will have these rituals and they take these mushrooms,

989
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:41.600
they'll step out to urinate the reindeer.

990
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.340
We'll knock them over to get at their urine.

991
00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:45.174
Snow.

992
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:45.810
Wow.

993
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:46.290
Yeah.

994
00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:47.123
They love it.

995
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:47.640
They love,

996
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.520
and why the fuck are these reindeer flying but dear,

997
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.210
why are they flying the,

998
00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.240
he's the Sharman who is red and white.

999
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:02.300
Like the Amnio Mascara mushroom is sitting in a carriage and he's fucking flying

1000
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:05.220
with all the bunch of deer who on mushrooms?

1001
00:29:05.221 --> 00:29:05.760
Mushroom.

1002
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.120
How,

1003
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.690
how clear do they have to make the myth that these rangers are high?

1004
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.230
Wow.

1005
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.670
I have to read this clear.

1006
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:12.923
It's really his name.

1007
00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.730
John Marco.

1008
00:29:14.731 --> 00:29:15.270
Allegra.

1009
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:15.700
Allegra.

1010
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.460
It's really hard to understand.

1011
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.800
I don't have any background in languages,

1012
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:20.301
so,

1013
00:29:20.301 --> 00:29:23.420
and listening to or reading how he broke it all down,

1014
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.110
apparently it's very controversial.

1015
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:25.651
Yes,

1016
00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:26.370
I can imagine.

1017
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:26.910
Yeah.

1018
00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:29.490
But the fact remains is like this guy was a,

1019
00:29:29.491 --> 00:29:29.730
uh,

1020
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:30.031
you know,

1021
00:29:30.031 --> 00:29:32.850
he's a legit brilliant scholar and an agnostic.

1022
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:38.210
And if you have one guy out of a list of religious vi Kooks that are reading

1023
00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:39.391
ancient shit,

1024
00:29:39.391 --> 00:29:40.221
hoping to find,

1025
00:29:40.221 --> 00:29:40.500
you know,

1026
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.360
Jesus special friends list or whatever the fuck your tribe,

1027
00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.420
they're not captains watch,

1028
00:29:46.421 --> 00:29:49.150
you're not going to be willing to consider anybody's alternative ideas.

1029
00:29:49.151 --> 00:29:50.050
So I dunno if he's right,

1030
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:50.884
but it's fascinating.

1031
00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:52.070
<v 1>It is fascinating.</v>

1032
00:29:52.071 --> 00:29:52.371
I mean,

1033
00:29:52.371 --> 00:29:53.310
cause I was in aid,

1034
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.020
I,

1035
00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:54.560
I've,

1036
00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:54.831
you know,

1037
00:29:54.831 --> 00:29:57.550
I've heard about the Saint Nicholas and all that and I,

1038
00:29:57.551 --> 00:30:00.280
and I was at that little chapel where he supposedly was and everything and it

1039
00:30:00.281 --> 00:30:03.680
was like you don't get a big Santa Claus wintertime,

1040
00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:04.580
you know,

1041
00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:04.931
Ho Ho,

1042
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:06.320
Ho drink a coca cola,

1043
00:30:06.321 --> 00:30:08.810
feel it sits to me.

1044
00:30:08.811 --> 00:30:10.220
The leap is really,

1045
00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:11.510
you know,

1046
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.900
other than he was the local guy who gave gifts and whatnot.

1047
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.020
Yeah.

1048
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:16.401
Hold on.

1049
00:30:16.401 --> 00:30:18.380
Fuck knows where all those stories came from.

1050
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:19.730
So fascinating.

1051
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.220
I thought flying reindeer,

1052
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:23.330
we're an invention of,

1053
00:30:23.331 --> 00:30:23.871
what's his name?

1054
00:30:23.871 --> 00:30:24.860
Clement more or whatever.

1055
00:30:24.861 --> 00:30:25.550
Who wrote,

1056
00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:26.990
was it night before Christmas?

1057
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.313
It could have been

1058
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:30.081
maybe,

1059
00:30:30.081 --> 00:30:34.300
but maybe tapped into something that you knew about flying range.

1060
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:34.631
<v 0>Well,</v>

1061
00:30:34.631 --> 00:30:36.760
I think that he'd heard a story from Europe.

1062
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:40.570
There's so many connections between this mushroom and Santa Claus.

1063
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:41.740
It's almost like,

1064
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:42.610
it's almost silly.

1065
00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:43.410
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1066
00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:45.310
But there's just like things like if you think about,

1067
00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:45.611
you know,

1068
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:46.690
like the pink Floyd,

1069
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.670
a wizard of Oz total,

1070
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:49.504
it's the same shit.

1071
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:52.450
You're going to find that something in anything

1072
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.341
<v 0>that's so true.</v>

1073
00:30:53.341 --> 00:30:55.440
But this one is really the whole story.

1074
00:30:55.441 --> 00:30:57.270
Like Santa Claus coming down the chimney.

1075
00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.820
That's how the Shaman used to get into the houses.

1076
00:30:59.821 --> 00:31:01.770
When they made the shamanic rituals illegal,

1077
00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:04.720
he used to sneak in because everybody was on the ground watching the door.

1078
00:31:04.721 --> 00:31:06.060
So they would throw their fucking sack,

1079
00:31:06.061 --> 00:31:09.570
a mushrooms over the chimney and they would climb down into these people's

1080
00:31:09.571 --> 00:31:10.404
houses.

1081
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:11.741
Yeah,

1082
00:31:11.741 --> 00:31:12.490
I mean this,

1083
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:17.490
there's so many connections between the whole Santa Claus myth and the this,

1084
00:31:18.011 --> 00:31:18.430
this,

1085
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:19.151
this mushroom,

1086
00:31:19.151 --> 00:31:20.440
the ritual of taking this mushroom,

1087
00:31:20.441 --> 00:31:21.610
especially in Siberia,

1088
00:31:21.611 --> 00:31:22.600
which is the fucking north.

1089
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:23.550
<v 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1090
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.261
They'll essentially,

1091
00:31:24.261 --> 00:31:24.730
it's a,

1092
00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:25.950
it's what people look at it as.

1093
00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:27.661
Yeah.

1094
00:31:27.661 --> 00:31:28.441
At the end of the earth.

1095
00:31:28.441 --> 00:31:29.160
No question.

1096
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:29.860
If you were living

1097
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.180
<v 0>Siberia and you found a mushroom,</v>

1098
00:31:31.181 --> 00:31:33.250
they make you trip your fucking balls off.

1099
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:35.460
How much they warm.

1100
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:35.711
Yeah.

1101
00:31:35.711 --> 00:31:37.150
Life would be so much more awesome.

1102
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.140
Icon that mushroom,

1103
00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:39.610
the trees and the birds.

1104
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:40.391
Oh yeah,

1105
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:40.750
that's,

1106
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.070
that's what kept them alive.

1107
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.650
They were there were trip their balls off every few months.

1108
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:45.150
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1109
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:46.230
It seems like a desperate,

1110
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.940
it always seemed like the most desperate place.

1111
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:48.451
I mean,

1112
00:31:48.451 --> 00:31:48.810
when you,

1113
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:52.890
when you lend your name to the bad patch of land in everyone's mind,

1114
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.570
even when you go to a restaurant,

1115
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:55.550
I know my wife,

1116
00:31:55.551 --> 00:31:56.400
if they put some more bad,

1117
00:31:56.401 --> 00:31:56.760
I'm like,

1118
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.001
hey,

1119
00:31:57.001 --> 00:31:58.080
why are we in Siberia?

1120
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:59.820
It's always Siberia.

1121
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.470
Siberia you have anytime.

1122
00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.540
It was a Russian movie,

1123
00:32:03.541 --> 00:32:06.960
like a James Bond movie and the Russian spy got sent to Siberia.

1124
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:07.620
Yeah.

1125
00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.490
Fucked out there.

1126
00:32:08.491 --> 00:32:08.731
I mean,

1127
00:32:08.731 --> 00:32:09.564
you're going to die.

1128
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:10.543
Yeah.

1129
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:11.101
Yeah.

1130
00:32:11.101 --> 00:32:11.611
If you,

1131
00:32:11.611 --> 00:32:15.060
if you could have a nice mushroom trip every couple of months,

1132
00:32:15.061 --> 00:32:18.210
keep you going though and take those eight tiny reindeer.

1133
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.860
They save the dolphins.

1134
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:24.143
Exactly.

1135
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.180
Fucking how cold does it get up there?

1136
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.170
It gets really cold.

1137
00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.730
Hundred degrees below zero.

1138
00:32:29.731 --> 00:32:29.941
Right.

1139
00:32:29.941 --> 00:32:30.600
It's horrible.

1140
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.920
And they're swimming in oil.

1141
00:32:31.921 --> 00:32:33.150
So they've saved themselves,

1142
00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:33.560
you know,

1143
00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.393
oh

1144
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:36.151
you saved yourself,

1145
00:32:36.151 --> 00:32:37.230
but you're stuck up there.

1146
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:38.130
Yeah,

1147
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:38.731
but you know what,

1148
00:32:38.731 --> 00:32:40.000
there's a documentary.

1149
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.110
<v 0>I say that there's a great documentary.</v>

1150
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:42.951
I just take that back.

1151
00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:43.784
I have to take it back.

1152
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.310
Um,

1153
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:47.240
a Werner Herzog's happy people.

1154
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.640
A life on the Thai guy,

1155
00:32:48.641 --> 00:32:52.370
I think it's called and it's about these people that live up there in Siberia

1156
00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:54.620
and they are all trappers right there apparently.

1157
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:55.820
Like they're like,

1158
00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.200
oh healthy.

1159
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.280
Everyone's happy.

1160
00:32:58.281 --> 00:32:58.910
There's no,

1161
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:00.680
no one has all day running around.

1162
00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:01.160
Yeah,

1163
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:01.993
exercising.

1164
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.460
No one has any like depression,

1165
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.530
no psychological disorders.

1166
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.960
It's a real happy culture.

1167
00:33:08.961 --> 00:33:12.320
And they showed them all get together and they follow them with the camera and

1168
00:33:12.321 --> 00:33:13.390
they followed them to their,

1169
00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:17.180
they're trapping routes where they would stay by themselves for months and

1170
00:33:17.181 --> 00:33:18.800
they're all fucking really happy.

1171
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:19.461
It was like,

1172
00:33:19.461 --> 00:33:20.360
it was weird.

1173
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:21.530
They get together,

1174
00:33:21.531 --> 00:33:24.170
they would be eating and laughing and all happy.

1175
00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.090
And at the end of the day,

1176
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.940
if we have really our temporary beings there,

1177
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.950
they are actually doing it right.

1178
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:32.390
We're doing it wrong.

1179
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:33.740
Well,

1180
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.060
they don't ever come home and go,

1181
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:37.970
I can't believe I got fucking passed over for a promotion.

1182
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.460
Yeah.

1183
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.690
Xanax and a wine.

1184
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.350
Yeah.

1185
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:43.280
I want to one line,

1186
00:33:43.281 --> 00:33:45.170
I want to watch a fucking real housewives,

1187
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.903
<v 2>Dexter.</v>

1188
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:47.270
No,

1189
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:47.690
no,

1190
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:48.523
they don't do that.

1191
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.830
And they live forever and they probably drink moderately and probably are

1192
00:33:51.831 --> 00:33:53.420
exercising all day every day.

1193
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.180
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1194
00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.620
And they're eating Caribou,

1195
00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.021
you know,

1196
00:33:56.021 --> 00:33:58.260
and the reading like the healthiest shit you can eat,

1197
00:33:58.261 --> 00:34:01.620
like fresh game and vegetables that they grow.

1198
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:03.450
It's fascinating,

1199
00:34:03.451 --> 00:34:03.690
man.

1200
00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:04.400
They're so much,

1201
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.151
<v 2>I haven't seen that one,</v>

1202
00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:06.250
but I did see one recently.

1203
00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.140
My wife rented a,

1204
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.600
and I can't think of the bloody name of it.

1205
00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:10.183
Oh,

1206
00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.600
you might have to look it up,

1207
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:12.050
Brian.

1208
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.950
It's about,

1209
00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:13.200
uh,

1210
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.150
the caves in France where the,

1211
00:34:17.151 --> 00:34:20.000
all the Chris dark paintings are the ones they found like 20 years ago,

1212
00:34:20.001 --> 00:34:20.181
you know,

1213
00:34:20.181 --> 00:34:22.760
that had the horses that are the ones that predate.

1214
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:23.380
Yeah.

1215
00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.230
And they're in motion.

1216
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:24.780
You know,

1217
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:28.220
in one room is like one guy's left hand like a zillion times.

1218
00:34:28.221 --> 00:34:31.040
He put it everywhere and it pops up a few other places in the cave.

1219
00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.570
And they're extensive.

1220
00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:32.840
And,

1221
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.260
uh,

1222
00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.340
they found them by accident,

1223
00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:34.650
all of us,

1224
00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:35.020
but hurts.

1225
00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.790
It goes in because they're closing them off except for study.

1226
00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.220
And he said his crew goes in and he,

1227
00:34:39.221 --> 00:34:40.054
uh,

1228
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.450
he shoots it and it is,

1229
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.950
Eh,

1230
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:43.783
you know,

1231
00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:44.480
I'll give him what,

1232
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:44.631
oh,

1233
00:34:44.631 --> 00:34:45.270
what's the end of the,

1234
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.920
uh,

1235
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.720
it's called the Cave of dreams.

1236
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.130
That's it.

1237
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:49.820
Is that it cave of dreams.

1238
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:52.630
But I'm always trying to think,

1239
00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:53.593
you know,

1240
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.300
suppose about your singing.

1241
00:34:55.301 --> 00:34:57.200
What was it like to live when gangsters came up in boats?

1242
00:34:57.201 --> 00:34:57.740
You know,

1243
00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:58.573
imagine,

1244
00:34:59.160 --> 00:34:59.993
I don't know,

1245
00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.190
50,000,

1246
00:35:01.191 --> 00:35:02.090
100,000,

1247
00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.770
200,000 years ago,

1248
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.850
and you were living in a cave and Lee were law,

1249
00:35:06.851 --> 00:35:09.830
much like those choppers in Siberia because he's now you're down to,

1250
00:35:09.831 --> 00:35:10.071
you know,

1251
00:35:10.071 --> 00:35:10.641
you're in a boat,

1252
00:35:10.641 --> 00:35:11.660
you probably have fire,

1253
00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:12.560
maybe you have.

1254
00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.380
But to see the sophistication of the drawings,

1255
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.060
the animation and the depiction of the animals in the imagination,

1256
00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:24.610
and to see this on a wall from 30,000 years ago,

1257
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.570
it's the connection that you know,

1258
00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:27.440
it,

1259
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.260
it is just yesterday and it's never different.

1260
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.880
All this technical stuff and all the wonder of your phone and the apps that you

1261
00:35:34.881 --> 00:35:36.770
can download is nothing,

1262
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:37.870
uh,

1263
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:38.130
in

1264
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:38.260
<v 1>the,</v>

1265
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.080
I don't mean that you should just not use it.

1266
00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:40.914
I mean,

1267
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.230
the connection of,

1268
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:43.891
of people,

1269
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:47.720
like you say a to what's happening is as a little more profound than,

1270
00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.980
and that's what always gets overlooked until he's like,

1271
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:50.041
oh,

1272
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:50.671
well that was then,

1273
00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:53.130
and people didn't want to know about like a couple of years ago,

1274
00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:53.860
you know?

1275
00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:54.510
Yeah.

1276
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.343
No kidding.

1277
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:56.880
I don't think you should dwell on the past,

1278
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:57.750
but of course I do.

1279
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.500
Uh,

1280
00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:58.891
but you know,

1281
00:35:58.891 --> 00:36:00.480
really found it fascinating to see the,

1282
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.530
the human touch.

1283
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.393
That's what gets you.

1284
00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:05.340
But I don't think a guy like you or a girl like me,

1285
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:09.610
it would be happy if all of a sudden we had a live like a Siberian trailer.

1286
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.081
No,

1287
00:36:10.081 --> 00:36:10.381
man.

1288
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:11.250
Are you kidding me?

1289
00:36:11.251 --> 00:36:12.390
I'm such a sissy.

1290
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:13.750
I,

1291
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:14.230
okay.

1292
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:15.110
No booty.

1293
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.580
Wouldn't we want to do the thing that seems to make you the most happy?

1294
00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:20.790
No,

1295
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:21.330
no,

1296
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:21.810
we're not.

1297
00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.010
We're not like that anymore.

1298
00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.150
I can't do it in Paris.

1299
00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:24.691
You know what I mean?

1300
00:36:24.691 --> 00:36:27.870
Like cell phones got this close or what know,

1301
00:36:27.871 --> 00:36:28.441
looking back,

1302
00:36:28.441 --> 00:36:29.011
is that what it is?

1303
00:36:29.011 --> 00:36:29.460
We,

1304
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.570
we ate the apple man.

1305
00:36:30.571 --> 00:36:31.404
It's over.

1306
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.000
There seems to be no looking back,

1307
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.500
it's like we want to,

1308
00:36:34.501 --> 00:36:36.120
we want to drive old cars.

1309
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:36.390
Oh,

1310
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:37.320
they're fucking cool.

1311
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.750
Imagine that day 68 corvette.

1312
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.080
People stop and look at it as it goes by.

1313
00:36:43.081 --> 00:36:44.100
It's like a time machine.

1314
00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:45.350
You're looking at an MRI machine.

1315
00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:45.950
We,

1316
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:46.830
we want to,

1317
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.200
but we wouldn't be happy back then.

1318
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:49.920
Now.

1319
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.510
I always say it wasn't better.

1320
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:52.950
It was just then,

1321
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.140
but those tag up people are right now.

1322
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.520
Absolutely they are.

1323
00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.120
But [inaudible] article about people keep losing live on an island in Greece who

1324
00:37:00.121 --> 00:37:02.550
purportedly lived to be a hundred and all it turns out,

1325
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:05.010
of course they didn't flooded their age when the study was done years ago,

1326
00:37:05.011 --> 00:37:07.430
but they are living to the nineties and,

1327
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:08.281
and close to a hundred,

1328
00:37:08.281 --> 00:37:09.120
almost all of them.

1329
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.811
And it's,

1330
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:10.644
you know,

1331
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:12.120
they go and visit each other.

1332
00:37:12.121 --> 00:37:13.470
They don't watch a lot of tele.

1333
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.760
They'd fucking eat olive oil.

1334
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.370
They likely have a glass of wine sunset,

1335
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:18.121
you know,

1336
00:37:18.121 --> 00:37:19.640
like walking around the garden.

1337
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:19.921
Oh,

1338
00:37:19.921 --> 00:37:20.381
it's hilly,

1339
00:37:20.381 --> 00:37:21.110
it's fuck.

1340
00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:24.360
And they're old and they whoop their ass up the hill all the time.

1341
00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:26.100
I bet that's big in and of itself.

1342
00:37:26.101 --> 00:37:27.420
Just walking up hills.

1343
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:28.590
Yeah,

1344
00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.660
it's the villages there and you were,

1345
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.100
that's fucking exercise.

1346
00:37:32.101 --> 00:37:33.450
Most people don't realize like it you,

1347
00:37:33.451 --> 00:37:34.620
you had to like,

1348
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:35.551
it's not,

1349
00:37:35.551 --> 00:37:36.450
they're not going hiking,

1350
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.350
that's their life.

1351
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:38.580
And they're doing it every day.

1352
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.330
Go to see your friend and you'll have tea or whatever,

1353
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.650
coffee and they have vegetable gardens and whatnot.

1354
00:37:43.651 --> 00:37:44.470
And he was like,

1355
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:47.310
they were describing in life and it was like the kind of thing you pay for it to

1356
00:37:47.311 --> 00:37:48.930
go away for it to your wife on a weekend,

1357
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:49.764
you know,

1358
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:53.520
that has to be to look at the Mediterranean and drink wine at sunset and you're

1359
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:54.120
like,

1360
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.370
I kicked around in the garden if that was part of it.

1361
00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.250
But do you think you'd be happy living there now?

1362
00:37:59.251 --> 00:38:01.080
I'd be bored senseless after a while.

1363
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.490
You'd have your studies,

1364
00:38:02.491 --> 00:38:02.731
right?

1365
00:38:02.731 --> 00:38:03.500
And you'd have your,

1366
00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:03.751
you know,

1367
00:38:03.751 --> 00:38:05.040
your computer if it worked,

1368
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:08.640
if it worked there on a remote island in the Mediterranean.

1369
00:38:08.641 --> 00:38:13.440
But you would have to be into like either starting a cult or doing some hardcore

1370
00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:14.190
drugs.

1371
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.810
That's the only way you would really write the book,

1372
00:38:15.811 --> 00:38:16.280
Joe.

1373
00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.280
That's where you write the book.

1374
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:18.623
Fuck,

1375
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.070
that's who's going to read it?

1376
00:38:20.071 --> 00:38:20.910
You're trapped.

1377
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:21.780
Well,

1378
00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.770
you got to leave.

1379
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.450
You have to get someone to deliver the book flow.

1380
00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:28.200
Have you been following the John Mccaffrey thing?

1381
00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.210
You know what that is?

1382
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:29.730
No.

1383
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.220
John McCaffrey is the virus king.

1384
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.800
The guy who created McCaffrey antivirus.

1385
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:35.710
Well,

1386
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:36.220
he

1387
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.910
<v 0>apparently is uh,</v>

1388
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.020
quite a character and uh,

1389
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:41.950
he started a business.

1390
00:38:41.951 --> 00:38:44.740
This is what this is the beginning of it started a business where he had low

1391
00:38:44.741 --> 00:38:46.030
flying planes.

1392
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:46.520
Uh,

1393
00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.690
they would do this sport where they fly like really low to the ground and

1394
00:38:49.691 --> 00:38:50.524
maneuver around.

1395
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.513
Well,

1396
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.150
yeah,

1397
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.370
one of the planes crashed.

1398
00:38:53.371 --> 00:38:54.190
Somebody died.

1399
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:58.720
So he got rid of all of his assets in America and transferred them over to

1400
00:38:58.721 --> 00:38:59.560
Billy's.

1401
00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:03.850
So he's in believes now he lives in Belize and he has a compound and believes

1402
00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:07.450
and in that compound he cooks up bath salts.

1403
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:11.350
So you know there's different chemicals that are being sold as bath salts.

1404
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:15.970
These various legal forms of some sort of crazy drug.

1405
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:16.940
They're legal,

1406
00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.820
the by loopholes Ho he's,

1407
00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:23.850
he's like cooking them and like free basing them and getting them down to like

1408
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:24.490
the,

1409
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:27.550
he's like purifying them and doing all these stuff.

1410
00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:27.761
No,

1411
00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:27.911
no.

1412
00:39:27.911 --> 00:39:28.960
He has labs.

1413
00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.360
He has labs in his jungle,

1414
00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:31.840
a fucking,

1415
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.260
he has photos and he takes photos of all the shit and puts it online and he

1416
00:39:35.261 --> 00:39:36.790
keeps a blog on too.

1417
00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.410
I'm sorry everybody,

1418
00:39:38.411 --> 00:39:39.220
I don't know,

1419
00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:43.060
something from the hinterland or something like that is the blog and he just

1420
00:39:43.061 --> 00:39:43.751
started the blog.

1421
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:48.700
It's fascinating because the dude is on the lamb because his neighbor is dead.

1422
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:53.970
His neighbor got shot in the head and his neighbor who he believes the McCaffrey

1423
00:39:55.721 --> 00:39:56.050
beliefs,

1424
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:59.210
this neighbor poisoned his dogs cause he had a bunch of dogs bark all the time.

1425
00:39:59.310 --> 00:39:59.861
He shot him.

1426
00:39:59.861 --> 00:40:01.360
So he believes that we are,

1427
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:02.171
I don't know if he shot him,

1428
00:40:02.171 --> 00:40:03.280
he says he didn't.

1429
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:08.490
But the Belize government says he did and he says this is not about that.

1430
00:40:08.801 --> 00:40:09.940
This is a just,

1431
00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.830
there are a bunch of criminals and they're,

1432
00:40:11.831 --> 00:40:12.101
you know,

1433
00:40:12.101 --> 00:40:15.070
they're corrupt and they're going after him for no reason and he had nothing to

1434
00:40:15.071 --> 00:40:17.230
do with it and he was fearing for his own life.

1435
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:19.330
He thought they were out to get him before they shot his.

1436
00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.130
They think that he said they set him up,

1437
00:40:21.131 --> 00:40:22.330
they killed his neighbor to set him.

1438
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:23.830
That's his take on it,

1439
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.260
but it's no doubt about that.

1440
00:40:26.261 --> 00:40:27.670
The dude is cooking bass off.

1441
00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:29.380
He's got,

1442
00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.090
he's got a 17 year old girlfriend.

1443
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.841
Yes,

1444
00:40:31.841 --> 00:40:32.674
he does.

1445
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.750
He's 62 or something like that.

1446
00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:37.660
This is some deep,

1447
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.680
he's crazy and he is breaking bad.

1448
00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:42.061
Yeah.

1449
00:40:42.061 --> 00:40:42.230
He's,

1450
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.320
he's a character in breaking bad.

1451
00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:45.183
Wow.

1452
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:46.910
He's a character to go look it up.

1453
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:50.710
It's a fucking amazing story because he's still,

1454
00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:52.270
he's still in the country.

1455
00:40:52.271 --> 00:40:53.051
He's hiding.

1456
00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:54.400
He's on the lamb there.

1457
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:58.510
They're trying to find him and try him for murder and he's blogging at the same

1458
00:40:58.511 --> 00:41:00.690
time as any compound in the laser.

1459
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.470
The 17 year old girlfriend cooking salt.

1460
00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:02.720
Yeah.

1461
00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:02.950
I,

1462
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:05.050
they day he escaped that compound.

1463
00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:05.440
Oh,

1464
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.000
he got out and now he's on the lamb.

1465
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:07.900
They don't know where he is,

1466
00:41:07.901 --> 00:41:08.950
but while he's out,

1467
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:09.970
he's blogging.

1468
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.330
I didn't even know that you can take bath salts.

1469
00:41:13.331 --> 00:41:14.164
Really?

1470
00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.180
I've used them so frequently in my bath.

1471
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.231
You know,

1472
00:41:17.231 --> 00:41:18.100
the bath salts,

1473
00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:18.970
you know the comment.

1474
00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:19.804
Do you know what that is?

1475
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.750
Well,

1476
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:23.500
I've hear about people taking them and doing,

1477
00:41:23.501 --> 00:41:25.060
committing dreadful acts and whatnot.

1478
00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:25.331
Well,

1479
00:41:25.331 --> 00:41:25.990
it's just,

1480
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.560
it's,

1481
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.460
they've taken some form of like math or some,

1482
00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:33.960
some intense form of narcotic drug,

1483
00:41:33.961 --> 00:41:34.670
something,

1484
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:36.040
and they'll change it,

1485
00:41:36.041 --> 00:41:37.310
like change a molecule,

1486
00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:38.540
added oxygen molecule,

1487
00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:42.560
do whatever to it that they have to do in order to make it a different chemical

1488
00:41:42.561 --> 00:41:43.400
classification.

1489
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.430
Then it becomes legal as long as they sell it,

1490
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.710
not for human consumption.

1491
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:50.990
So they sell it as bath salts.

1492
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:53.600
So they sell it and you know,

1493
00:41:53.601 --> 00:41:55.100
everybody knows what the fuck it really is.

1494
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:55.820
But what is it?

1495
00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.160
It's some meth flight drug.

1496
00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:58.461
Oh,

1497
00:41:58.461 --> 00:41:59.330
so it's speeding.

1498
00:41:59.360 --> 00:41:59.541
Yeah.

1499
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:00.460
It's like,

1500
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.760
it's not like DMT or something.

1501
00:42:01.761 --> 00:42:02.120
No,

1502
00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:02.381
no,

1503
00:42:02.381 --> 00:42:02.621
no,

1504
00:42:02.621 --> 00:42:02.870
no,

1505
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:03.171
no.

1506
00:42:03.171 --> 00:42:04.190
It's horrible.

1507
00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.930
It's a terrible drug,

1508
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:06.830
supposedly.

1509
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:07.670
Supposedly.

1510
00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.500
But that was the other thing.

1511
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.340
Um,

1512
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:10.431
uh,

1513
00:42:10.431 --> 00:42:14.390
McCaffrey was talking about how his form of it that he's been cooking up,

1514
00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:15.170
uh,

1515
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:18.260
makes a four hypersexuality God,

1516
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.741
yes.

1517
00:42:18.741 --> 00:42:21.900
He was talking about people rubbing their penises,

1518
00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:26.930
Ra and then just having monkey sex like for hours and hours.

1519
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:29.210
So he just,

1520
00:42:29.211 --> 00:42:34.211
you picture this cracked out 60 year old dude hanging with a 17 year old girl in

1521
00:42:34.521 --> 00:42:39.521
the jungle on this fucking insane drug concoction that he's cooked up in his own

1522
00:42:40.041 --> 00:42:42.830
lab and he's a brilliant guy.

1523
00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:43.240
It's,

1524
00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.410
it's like he's a brilliant guy.

1525
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.490
Gone Mad.

1526
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.331
It's really,

1527
00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:48.830
it's really fascinating man.

1528
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:49.730
That is,

1529
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:50.840
that's extraordinary.

1530
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.770
Yeah.

1531
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:52.370
Let me,

1532
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.740
let me pull up what this drug actually is.

1533
00:42:54.741 --> 00:42:55.574
Just so we

1534
00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.240
substituted,

1535
00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.680
Catherine owns,

1536
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:03.800
which have similar effects of amphetamine and cocaine.

1537
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:08.210
The white crystals resemble legal bathing products like Epsom salts and are

1538
00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:10.130
called bath salts with the packaging,

1539
00:43:10.131 --> 00:43:13.850
often stating not for human consumption and an attempt to avoid the prohibition

1540
00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:14.331
of drugs,

1541
00:43:14.331 --> 00:43:17.420
but chemically have nothing to do with actual bath salts.

1542
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:18.853
Yeah.

1543
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.200
So there's just something they've created in a lab.

1544
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.270
It's like they figured out a way around it.

1545
00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.141
It's amazing,

1546
00:43:24.141 --> 00:43:24.380
man.

1547
00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:25.640
People are Gross,

1548
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:26.420
you know,

1549
00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.620
people are so gross,

1550
00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:27.991
they'll,

1551
00:43:27.991 --> 00:43:32.000
they'll spend their time to come up with some new form of meth and then just

1552
00:43:32.001 --> 00:43:35.030
release it in some legal loophole in like laugh all the way.

1553
00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.530
There's a fucking demons.

1554
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.540
People who sell that are demons.

1555
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:42.171
Yeah.

1556
00:43:42.171 --> 00:43:42.750
That lets the,

1557
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:43.940
isn't that all the um,

1558
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:48.130
people have psychotic episodes and go furiously mental and kill people by

1559
00:43:48.131 --> 00:43:49.580
People's faces off and shit?

1560
00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:51.320
Well they said that that guy,

1561
00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:53.390
they said he tested positive for marijuana.

1562
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.280
That was one of the things that they were saying,

1563
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:58.860
which I found hilarious because the,

1564
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:00.860
what they didn't say it's,

1565
00:44:00.861 --> 00:44:02.630
which is really kind of fucking creepy.

1566
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:07.190
They didn't say in the news report that they can't really test for bath salts.

1567
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:08.503
Like most,

1568
00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:09.890
most bath salts,

1569
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.550
they don't,

1570
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:11.630
they don't have like,

1571
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:13.190
they don't have a marker for them.

1572
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:14.780
They're a bunch of different,

1573
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:16.530
there's a bunch of different kinds too.

1574
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.360
So it's like,

1575
00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.440
just because like he didn't test for heroin or didn't test for crystal method,

1576
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.130
method,

1577
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.963
whatever it is.

1578
00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.920
That doesn't mean he wasn't on mass salts.

1579
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:26.890
Like they said he wasn't on bass halls.

1580
00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:27.800
They said he was on marijuana.

1581
00:44:27.801 --> 00:44:28.634
But that's like such,

1582
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:30.170
that's such shitty reporting.

1583
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.050
Like you have tell the truth that it's,

1584
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.070
<v 1>it's hard to find out if people were on the show rumor or the,</v>

1585
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:39.660
the accepted knowledge was that he was on dos salts and that's why he was so

1586
00:44:39.661 --> 00:44:40.200
psychotic.

1587
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:40.381
Yeah.

1588
00:44:40.381 --> 00:44:41.460
But that's not what they,

1589
00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:43.440
they got when they did the,

1590
00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:43.661
Oh,

1591
00:44:43.661 --> 00:44:44.041
of course.

1592
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:46.580
Not The chemical tests on him after he is,

1593
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:47.101
well,

1594
00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:47.911
if it doesn't show up,

1595
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:48.744
it's not going to be,

1596
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.570
Brian doesn't think the cop should have killed the guy.

1597
00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.351
Right.

1598
00:44:52.351 --> 00:44:55.590
Isn't that the one that we disagreed when the guy was eating the guy's face?

1599
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:56.301
You,

1600
00:44:56.301 --> 00:44:57.870
you didn't think that the cop should have shot him.

1601
00:44:57.871 --> 00:44:58.940
Was it you or was it Duncan?

1602
00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:00.583
Duncan?

1603
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:04.080
Duncan didn't think the cops should have shot the guy and was like,

1604
00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.470
[inaudible] face man murdering somebody.

1605
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:08.020
Yeah.

1606
00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.140
That's murdering somebody.

1607
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.510
Natalie,

1608
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:12.510
that like that is such a fucking creepy way to go about it.

1609
00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:13.890
Eating someone's face.

1610
00:45:13.891 --> 00:45:14.900
And I think that cops a lot of,

1611
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.150
shoot,

1612
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:16.140
you just me,

1613
00:45:16.141 --> 00:45:16.980
I'm old school.

1614
00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.053
Uh,

1615
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:19.650
yeah.

1616
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.750
If it's happening to me and let me put it that way,

1617
00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:23.550
please go ahead and shoot that guy.

1618
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:24.930
Jesus Christ.

1619
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.960
Seeding faces might be good.

1620
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:29.700
So this John McCaffrey guy,

1621
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:30.151
he's,

1622
00:45:30.151 --> 00:45:30.750
um,

1623
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:34.410
he's actually got a blog while he's on the lamb.

1624
00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:39.590
So there's this crazy government in Billy's is looking for him like they sending

1625
00:45:39.871 --> 00:45:40.890
like according to him,

1626
00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.420
he hasn't to soldiers to his house.

1627
00:45:42.421 --> 00:45:42.840
I don't,

1628
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.680
I don't know man.

1629
00:45:43.681 --> 00:45:44.430
I don't know what,

1630
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:45.270
cause he's gotten that name.

1631
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:45.601
Yeah,

1632
00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:45.931
I don't,

1633
00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:47.970
I don't know how it works.

1634
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.640
The least has been a haven forever for people from the states.

1635
00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.410
Hasn't really a lot of ex pats.

1636
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.891
Yeah.

1637
00:45:52.891 --> 00:45:53.701
I think confederates,

1638
00:45:53.701 --> 00:45:54.331
that type of thing.

1639
00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:54.511
It's,

1640
00:45:54.511 --> 00:45:54.760
you know,

1641
00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.010
I said rum runner kind of,

1642
00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.570
I think you can end up in Belize.

1643
00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.760
So it's just like one of those wild places.

1644
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:00.441
I mean,

1645
00:46:00.441 --> 00:46:00.840
I don't,

1646
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:01.920
I've been once,

1647
00:46:01.921 --> 00:46:03.210
but I didn't really go to like,

1648
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:03.960
you know,

1649
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.120
smuggler's cove to story.

1650
00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.020
So fascinating.

1651
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:11.430
When a really smart guy goes off the rails,

1652
00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:15.110
we're waiting for Bill Gates to like build a giant veranda.

1653
00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:17.250
Have you ever seen the,

1654
00:46:17.251 --> 00:46:17.550
uh,

1655
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:19.830
descriptions of a gates home?

1656
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:21.331
Oh yeah.

1657
00:46:21.331 --> 00:46:21.751
Right.

1658
00:46:21.751 --> 00:46:22.800
It's insane.

1659
00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.660
He was incredible.

1660
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:25.523
Right.

1661
00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.120
And everything he talked to the maximum,

1662
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.410
you can just go brewer and shit flies.

1663
00:46:29.411 --> 00:46:33.480
Or he puts a clip on when he walks in and as he enters into rooms,

1664
00:46:33.481 --> 00:46:35.070
they adjust to his liking.

1665
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:35.820
Yeah,

1666
00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:36.690
that's fucking,

1667
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:38.010
that's gangster.

1668
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.080
That's really gangster.

1669
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.460
When you're bill gates though,

1670
00:46:41.461 --> 00:46:43.110
anything less would be ridiculous.

1671
00:46:43.111 --> 00:46:43.351
I mean,

1672
00:46:43.351 --> 00:46:43.531
yeah,

1673
00:46:43.531 --> 00:46:43.800
no,

1674
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.640
he has to do it.

1675
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.740
William Randolph Hearst to whatever.

1676
00:46:47.741 --> 00:46:49.890
We're building a giant palace for yourself.

1677
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:52.860
But how much do you bet his toilet crashes all the time.

1678
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:53.880
His Twitter crashes.

1679
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:55.530
Toilet toilet crashes.

1680
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:56.893
Why do you think?

1681
00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:58.830
Because it's always sits like windows and stuff,

1682
00:46:58.831 --> 00:46:59.980
so it's all probably just,

1683
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.833
Oh

1684
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:05.160
this is actually toilet was the shower stopped honey?

1685
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.700
Yeah,

1686
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.750
it's a kind of virus.

1687
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:10.740
He's someone that like if your computer fucks up and having him in the house I

1688
00:47:10.741 --> 00:47:11.820
think would be super handy.

1689
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:13.680
It would definitely help me cause he didn't be like,

1690
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:13.891
Oh,

1691
00:47:13.891 --> 00:47:15.180
let me just call somebody.

1692
00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:16.970
You know,

1693
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:17.491
you're going,

1694
00:47:17.491 --> 00:47:18.120
fuck,

1695
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.430
how come my email's not working for like a day?

1696
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.061
He's just like,

1697
00:47:21.061 --> 00:47:21.894
buy Mac.

1698
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:24.180
The number of viruses that exist,

1699
00:47:24.181 --> 00:47:27.330
computer viruses that exists are fucking terrifying.

1700
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:32.020
If you really stop and think about how many assholes out there figured out a way

1701
00:47:32.021 --> 00:47:33.820
to crack into people's computers,

1702
00:47:33.821 --> 00:47:37.030
like how many hundreds of thousands of people did it and you're,

1703
00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:38.890
there's schools of there.

1704
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:40.570
He gets scam emails,

1705
00:47:40.571 --> 00:47:41.404
you know,

1706
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:42.041
hey man,

1707
00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:43.030
from my friends.

1708
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.050
Yeah,

1709
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:44.460
yeah,

1710
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:44.730
yeah,

1711
00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:44.961
yeah,

1712
00:47:44.961 --> 00:47:45.490
yeah,

1713
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:45.761
yeah.

1714
00:47:45.761 --> 00:47:46.780
I've got them from me.

1715
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.130
That's gotten emails from me.

1716
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.850
Right.

1717
00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:49.451
What is this?

1718
00:47:49.451 --> 00:47:50.200
That's a weird,

1719
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.190
it's so crazy.

1720
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.180
What are you doing man?

1721
00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:54.580
I don't know.

1722
00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:55.413
I was just sitting there.

1723
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:56.463
Maybe it was crazy.

1724
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.241
I your crazy.

1725
00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:58.450
I didn't know what to say on there.

1726
00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.680
I saw like emails from my website.

1727
00:48:02.681 --> 00:48:02.951
I was like,

1728
00:48:02.951 --> 00:48:04.000
how is that even possible?

1729
00:48:04.001 --> 00:48:04.834
That's crazy.

1730
00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:07.130
I don't know what it actually says when you look into it.

1731
00:48:07.131 --> 00:48:07.964
I don't click on them,

1732
00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:12.820
but just the idea that someone can do that at this John McAfee thing.

1733
00:48:12.821 --> 00:48:17.821
Would you want to end up riding wild and some tropical place at the end of here?

1734
00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.160
I can have Jackson Fun.

1735
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.521
No,

1736
00:48:21.521 --> 00:48:23.230
it seems like another novel.

1737
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:23.651
Yeah,

1738
00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:24.670
that seems like you are.

1739
00:48:24.671 --> 00:48:28.330
Just trying to burn out that you try to just fizzle out.

1740
00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:29.933
You just trying to,

1741
00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:33.600
you realize the end is near and so you're just going to go out guns blazing,

1742
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:34.780
rubbing your dick raw.

1743
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:35.320
Right.

1744
00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:35.921
Smoke it.

1745
00:48:35.921 --> 00:48:36.521
Bath salts,

1746
00:48:36.521 --> 00:48:36.830
bagging,

1747
00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:37.870
17 year olds.

1748
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:38.913
I mean,

1749
00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:39.970
it's pretty wild though.

1750
00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:41.230
It's the stuff of legend.

1751
00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:41.531
It's,

1752
00:48:41.531 --> 00:48:42.610
that's like one of those things.

1753
00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:44.470
Or if I did,

1754
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:45.610
if I didn't know about it,

1755
00:48:45.611 --> 00:48:48.430
I'd be angry if you knew about it and you didn't tell me I want to,

1756
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:49.930
I want to know what he's doing.

1757
00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:50.621
You know,

1758
00:48:50.621 --> 00:48:54.060
he's a crazy guy and he's a fucking really rich guy too.

1759
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:57.400
He sold his company to Microsoft for over a billion dollar.

1760
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:58.090
Oh my God.

1761
00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.020
So He's just funded.

1762
00:48:59.140 --> 00:48:59.660
Yeah.

1763
00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:03.910
So this crazy ass hole had like this compound and he was having low flying

1764
00:49:03.911 --> 00:49:04.840
plans.

1765
00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:05.411
I mean,

1766
00:49:05.411 --> 00:49:07.960
just stop and think about how fucking bananas you have.

1767
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:09.840
The thing that of course someone died,

1768
00:49:09.841 --> 00:49:10.451
someone dies.

1769
00:49:10.451 --> 00:49:10.900
Yeah.

1770
00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:11.790
And then they're selling them.

1771
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.770
So he just fucking Ballz he's nuts,

1772
00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:15.613
man.

1773
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:18.220
I don't know if he killed his neighbor,

1774
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:19.121
but,

1775
00:49:19.121 --> 00:49:19.954
uh,

1776
00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:21.040
uh,

1777
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:21.700
not to,

1778
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:22.990
it's probably pretty obvious.

1779
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.160
The Colonel Kurtz thing.

1780
00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:25.660
Yeah.

1781
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:29.590
Well I think whenever a guy like starts his own thing in a small country and

1782
00:49:29.591 --> 00:49:31.180
picks a 17 year old as his,

1783
00:49:31.181 --> 00:49:31.840
uh,

1784
00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.650
his companion.

1785
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:33.483
That's right.

1786
00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:34.323
Yeah.

1787
00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:34.660
You're,

1788
00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:35.291
you're really,

1789
00:49:35.291 --> 00:49:36.910
you're going for a low bar son.

1790
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:37.650
No,

1791
00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:37.861
no,

1792
00:49:37.861 --> 00:49:38.050
no.

1793
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:38.380
Here,

1794
00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.850
that's out of bounds.

1795
00:49:39.851 --> 00:49:43.000
And you're really old for a 17 year old man.

1796
00:49:43.001 --> 00:49:45.980
That's kind of your old for 17 year old if you're 25 minutes.

1797
00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:47.111
Yeah.

1798
00:49:47.111 --> 00:49:48.100
That's Kinda crazy.

1799
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:48.960
Well,

1800
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.600
it's just one of those stories and I just,

1801
00:49:50.601 --> 00:49:50.731
I'm,

1802
00:49:50.731 --> 00:49:53.860
I'm fascinated by people off the rails when,

1803
00:49:53.861 --> 00:49:56.890
when we realized that these patterns that we file,

1804
00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:01.840
that we don't have to follow them and oftentimes people just say fuck this and

1805
00:50:01.841 --> 00:50:06.310
just completely exit the normal train of behavior,

1806
00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:10.510
like fascinated by all the dictators chore.

1807
00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:11.080
Yeah.

1808
00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.070
Because they don't,

1809
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.730
you know,

1810
00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:13.600
there's no rules.

1811
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:15.970
They kill people personally in front of other people and then go,

1812
00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:16.840
this is how it goes.

1813
00:50:16.841 --> 00:50:21.160
And then that's how they start their gig and then you take over and you punish

1814
00:50:21.161 --> 00:50:22.660
in you whatever.

1815
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:23.741
Yeah.

1816
00:50:23.741 --> 00:50:27.890
We're always fascinated by the ones throughout history and most recent ones

1817
00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:28.370
like,

1818
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:32.480
like Hussein and his sons used to scare the shit out of me when you would hear

1819
00:50:32.481 --> 00:50:36.170
the stories of what they did and you know that all those stories are not made

1820
00:50:36.171 --> 00:50:36.620
up.

1821
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.770
No feeding people to dogs,

1822
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:39.560
Dude.

1823
00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.820
It's old time stuff.

1824
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:41.330
Yeah.

1825
00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:43.250
They would take people,

1826
00:50:43.251 --> 00:50:46.700
just random people and like girls were about to get married.

1827
00:50:46.701 --> 00:50:48.530
They would steal them from the guy,

1828
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:49.723
throw the guy,

1829
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.870
feed him to dogs,

1830
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:53.800
fuck the girl raper and then feed her dogs.

1831
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:54.740
They liked horror.

1832
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.990
They did shit like that on a regular basis.

1833
00:50:56.991 --> 00:50:58.670
That dogs that were eating people.

1834
00:50:58.690 --> 00:50:59.523
Yeah.

1835
00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:00.620
Mother fuckers,

1836
00:51:00.621 --> 00:51:00.951
man.

1837
00:51:00.951 --> 00:51:01.401
I mean the,

1838
00:51:01.401 --> 00:51:01.641
the,

1839
00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:03.580
that something can happen in,

1840
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:08.620
in the human mind where it allows them to become so vicious and detached from

1841
00:51:09.411 --> 00:51:10.580
other people suffering to the,

1842
00:51:10.581 --> 00:51:10.850
to,

1843
00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:12.740
to the point where they actually enjoy it.

1844
00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.380
Like that scares the fuck out of us.

1845
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.671
Absolutely.

1846
00:51:16.671 --> 00:51:18.440
And that power that,

1847
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:25.210
that informs all that you have so much power that no one can gain.

1848
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:25.820
Say You,

1849
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.380
I'm going to do that kind of shit.

1850
00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.880
And if you didn't like it.

1851
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:30.531
Yeah,

1852
00:51:30.531 --> 00:51:32.870
it's fucking crazy that we could go that way.

1853
00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:33.321
It's,

1854
00:51:33.321 --> 00:51:38.321
it's like the human brain needs a really good directions manual,

1855
00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:40.453
you know,

1856
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:42.230
a really good one.

1857
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:45.860
You have to like get a degree in before you can live,

1858
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:47.023
you know what I mean?

1859
00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:47.661
He really should.

1860
00:51:47.661 --> 00:51:52.610
We should take all babies and quarantine them from the rest of society and raise

1861
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:53.453
them,

1862
00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:54.010
raise them,

1863
00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:55.160
then examine people,

1864
00:51:55.161 --> 00:52:00.161
get their kids on a and a emoney and the and that has a mushroom farm and while

1865
00:52:00.741 --> 00:52:02.540
while the kid is going through school,

1866
00:52:02.541 --> 00:52:07.541
the parents are being reconditioned program to learn how to fly like a ranger

1867
00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:11.000
and then run in the jungle later with the young,

1868
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:13.851
the,

1869
00:52:13.851 --> 00:52:15.620
I think there's probably a bunch of cultures,

1870
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:17.870
a punch of ancient cultures that did a lot of mushrooms.

1871
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:20.660
If you really look at like cattle worship and stuff like that.

1872
00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:26.620
I would think psychoactive substances were instrumental in almost every,

1873
00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:28.010
oh,

1874
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.850
not to be boring,

1875
00:52:28.851 --> 00:52:30.260
but I just read about in the Columbus book,

1876
00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.310
the Taino,

1877
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:33.470
Indians used to blow a powder,

1878
00:52:33.471 --> 00:52:37.580
a certain seed and put it in a pipe and blow it up each other's nose and have

1879
00:52:37.581 --> 00:52:38.780
mystical trans experience,

1880
00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:39.890
psychedelic experiences.

1881
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:40.490
What was the,

1882
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:42.620
what was the stuff and if I could remember,

1883
00:52:42.621 --> 00:52:43.520
I would tell you gel.

1884
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:44.480
It's a,

1885
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.450
some seed that grows on the islands in the Caribbean.

1886
00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:48.430
I could get,

1887
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:51.080
I could email you later when I go back and look at the book.

1888
00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:51.943
But uh,

1889
00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:52.821
the Spanish took,

1890
00:52:52.821 --> 00:52:55.790
took note of that and their ceremonies and how they danced and what they wore

1891
00:52:55.791 --> 00:52:59.590
and how they conducted these giant things with the priests and they were taking

1892
00:52:59.591 --> 00:53:00.750
drugs in front of them and you know,

1893
00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.190
you blew it up your nose and once you got a big hit in each,

1894
00:53:04.191 --> 00:53:05.024
in Australia,

1895
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:05.930
you know.

1896
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:06.350
Yeah.

1897
00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.150
There's other cultures that have done that too.

1898
00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:09.940
They take like tubes and they stick them,

1899
00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.570
he chose nostrils and they'll,

1900
00:53:11.571 --> 00:53:13.250
they'll blow this stuff,

1901
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.660
uh,

1902
00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:15.310
into each other who really like,

1903
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:19.550
and it's like super painful experience and then it goes right to your brain.

1904
00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:19.911
Yeah.

1905
00:53:19.911 --> 00:53:21.440
And apparently it's a,

1906
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:24.090
some of them are DMT based solely.

1907
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:24.650
Yeah.

1908
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:25.740
Some of them are having a,

1909
00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:26.100
I think

1910
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.150
<v 0>it's called equal.</v>

1911
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.660
Hey is one of those a nasal,

1912
00:53:30.661 --> 00:53:31.710
a blast and drugs.

1913
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:35.820
And the problem is with the deforestation in the Amazon that like these people

1914
00:53:35.821 --> 00:53:39.390
that know how to make that stuff and know exactly what the lore behind it all

1915
00:53:39.391 --> 00:53:39.550
is.

1916
00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:40.383
They're going away.

1917
00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:40.800
They're,

1918
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.633
they're being,

1919
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:42.900
they're being pushed out.

1920
00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:46.470
There's so much logging going on and it's really,

1921
00:53:46.471 --> 00:53:47.320
it's an Amazon store.

1922
00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:52.920
Everything and all the psychoactive drugs are there that can help us and hear us

1923
00:53:52.921 --> 00:53:55.410
and make us at least make us have a good time.

1924
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:56.031
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1925
00:53:56.031 --> 00:53:57.330
At least in America,

1926
00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:00.030
I think the whole continent with CIC,

1927
00:54:00.031 --> 00:54:00.960
psychoactive drugs,

1928
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.820
weed and you know,

1929
00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:03.810
but definitely mushrooms.

1930
00:54:03.811 --> 00:54:04.550
And

1931
00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:05.850
<v 0>I did a tour,</v>

1932
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:08.230
Cheech and Eatsa with a professor and a,

1933
00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.040
it was really cool because they,

1934
00:54:10.041 --> 00:54:12.980
you could hire a local professor and he,

1935
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:17.840
one of the things that he talked about that I'd never heard anybody have like a

1936
00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:22.900
real scholar talk about was how active actively they took psychoactive drugs and

1937
00:54:23.061 --> 00:54:24.320
he was talking about how this was a,

1938
00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:26.090
they had a chamber and he said,

1939
00:54:26.091 --> 00:54:30.170
and they would go in here and they would take various psychoactive drugs and he

1940
00:54:30.171 --> 00:54:31.910
thinks that some of them are mushrooms,

1941
00:54:31.911 --> 00:54:34.100
some of them were some,

1942
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:36.980
there was a root or something that contained my surgical [inaudible] acid.

1943
00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:40.760
There's a few different ones that they had figured out could make you trip,

1944
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:45.410
but they would have regular psychedelic rituals and to us that sounds ridiculous

1945
00:54:45.411 --> 00:54:45.801
because it's like,

1946
00:54:45.801 --> 00:54:46.101
listen,

1947
00:54:46.101 --> 00:54:46.431
stop.

1948
00:54:46.431 --> 00:54:47.030
All that bullshit,

1949
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:50.710
which you need to do is you need to go to fucking school and you need to get to

1950
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:51.291
go to college,

1951
00:54:51.291 --> 00:54:51.820
get a good job.

1952
00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:51.990
Well,

1953
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:55.280
we don't understand is there was no school before this.

1954
00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:59.900
You're talking about people that literally created the first structures as far

1955
00:54:59.901 --> 00:55:04.010
as we know that would like that near them and the way they were inspired might

1956
00:55:04.011 --> 00:55:06.320
have been through psychedelic drugs.

1957
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:09.110
It might be that these people were,

1958
00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:13.670
were given these ideas through these drugs and that's why they're so similar to

1959
00:55:13.671 --> 00:55:17.870
other cultures where they also use psychedelic drugs and make these crazy stone

1960
00:55:17.871 --> 00:55:20.000
structures that mimic the cosmos.

1961
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:21.170
It's really fascinating.

1962
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:21.391
<v 2>Well,</v>

1963
00:55:21.391 --> 00:55:21.860
I think it,

1964
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:25.530
it does and I think that's why it's such an integral and it profound.

1965
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.900
That's why it's always part of the religious culture too.

1966
00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.720
It wasn't a recreational thing like let's go get fucked up.

1967
00:55:30.721 --> 00:55:31.490
They,

1968
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:31.880
uh,

1969
00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:35.100
the Indian societies are completely prescribed by religion that John went off in

1970
00:55:35.101 --> 00:55:37.760
the morning and everybody got up and people went to religious school and priests

1971
00:55:37.761 --> 00:55:41.430
who are the hierarchy and the things you're talking about with those taking the

1972
00:55:41.431 --> 00:55:41.761
mushrooms.

1973
00:55:41.761 --> 00:55:45.000
I think that the intuition that they derived at the very beginning when they

1974
00:55:45.001 --> 00:55:47.910
first took them and how they were able to refine it and cultivate it,

1975
00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:48.261
like you say,

1976
00:55:48.261 --> 00:55:49.950
and find out which ones did,

1977
00:55:49.951 --> 00:55:54.951
which they absolutely leads to the creative process and that's why they

1978
00:55:55.231 --> 00:55:56.700
incorporated it into their

1979
00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:57.751
<v 0>system.</v>

1980
00:55:57.751 --> 00:55:58.320
You know,

1981
00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:58.951
it's amazing.

1982
00:55:58.951 --> 00:56:00.150
Europeans just don't,

1983
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:00.631
you know,

1984
00:56:00.631 --> 00:56:01.680
it was the alcohol by then,

1985
00:56:01.681 --> 00:56:03.930
by the time they met in the Middle Ages.

1986
00:56:03.931 --> 00:56:04.260
It's,

1987
00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:08.580
that's why they were so savage that alcohol based cultures and cans and liquor,

1988
00:56:08.581 --> 00:56:09.690
baby guns,

1989
00:56:09.691 --> 00:56:10.680
liquor and conquer.

1990
00:56:10.681 --> 00:56:15.681
That's a totally different attitude than the psychedelic cultures to come to.

1991
00:56:16.471 --> 00:56:16.960
It's just the,

1992
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.251
yeah,

1993
00:56:17.251 --> 00:56:18.084
for sure.

1994
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:21.000
Druid certainly get it going and Oh yeah,

1995
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.691
definitely.

1996
00:56:21.691 --> 00:56:22.110
Yeah.

1997
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:24.280
I mean there's a lot of mushrooms in Europe,

1998
00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:25.391
apparently.

1999
00:56:25.391 --> 00:56:25.631
Any,

2000
00:56:25.631 --> 00:56:27.400
I think anywhere where like rains a lot.

2001
00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:28.853
<v 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2002
00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:30.291
And then if it,

2003
00:56:30.291 --> 00:56:30.871
if it doesn't,

2004
00:56:30.871 --> 00:56:31.704
I don't know.

2005
00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:33.690
I mean I was in Morocco and uh,

2006
00:56:33.691 --> 00:56:34.411
I didn't get that.

2007
00:56:34.411 --> 00:56:36.000
They were,

2008
00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:37.890
I'm sure they had second thoughts,

2009
00:56:37.891 --> 00:56:39.660
but you can eat Hashi share,

2010
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:40.051
whatever.

2011
00:56:40.051 --> 00:56:40.621
You know what I mean?

2012
00:56:40.621 --> 00:56:42.380
If you really want to have on

2013
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:46.470
a mind altering,

2014
00:56:46.471 --> 00:56:46.920
you know,

2015
00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:47.481
experienced,

2016
00:56:47.481 --> 00:56:49.140
that's easily doable.

2017
00:56:49.141 --> 00:56:51.750
Everyone I think in the whole country has access to,

2018
00:56:51.751 --> 00:56:52.584
you know,

2019
00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:54.840
mad amounts of Keith and,

2020
00:56:54.841 --> 00:56:56.580
and marijuana and has,

2021
00:56:56.581 --> 00:57:00.060
she shouldn't and different grades and different places and

2022
00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:03.780
they're not a booze culture.

2023
00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:04.111
Right.

2024
00:57:04.111 --> 00:57:07.050
And like they're a dope culture and that doesn't mean you're not in violent.

2025
00:57:07.051 --> 00:57:09.750
I think that's always a funny joke because it's true,

2026
00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:12.210
you know that stoners don't commit violence.

2027
00:57:12.211 --> 00:57:16.730
But I would think rosters and gangsters just proved the theory that you,

2028
00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:17.540
yeah,

2029
00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:18.510
you can be high.

2030
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:19.830
He's stoned and still fuck.

2031
00:57:19.831 --> 00:57:22.230
The Hawaiians like smoke.

2032
00:57:22.231 --> 00:57:24.280
While I was going to say a lot of people's houses,

2033
00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:26.500
so they'll get high and be like,

2034
00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:27.000
yeah,

2035
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.450
maybe they're nicer than they.

2036
00:57:28.451 --> 00:57:28.700
They would

2037
00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:31.060
<v 0>have been if it wasn't with the,</v>

2038
00:57:31.061 --> 00:57:34.120
we just certainly they're going to stop after it and get something.

2039
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:34.661
They'll,

2040
00:57:34.661 --> 00:57:35.500
they won't kill you.

2041
00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:36.610
They won't beat you to death.

2042
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:38.223
They'll let you live.

2043
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:39.560
The,

2044
00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:39.890
um,

2045
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:40.480
the,

2046
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:40.661
uh,

2047
00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:43.420
the Hindus had something called Soma,

2048
00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:47.800
which to this day they don't know exactly what it was,

2049
00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:50.230
but it was so important to them.

2050
00:57:50.231 --> 00:57:51.064
They had all these,

2051
00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:56.490
these beautifully written texts on how Great Soma was compared it to all these

2052
00:57:58.391 --> 00:57:58.901
other things.

2053
00:57:58.901 --> 00:57:59.800
Better than Indra,

2054
00:57:59.801 --> 00:58:00.850
better than Brahma,

2055
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:02.260
all these different things.

2056
00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:03.980
Soma was the,

2057
00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:08.050
the best psychedelic drug and no one knows what the fuck it is really to this.

2058
00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:08.530
Yes.

2059
00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:09.970
It was so important to them,

2060
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:13.150
but it's written of Britain of but they don't know what it,

2061
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.870
what it,

2062
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:15.130
what was in inside of it.

2063
00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:16.960
Whether it was a common atory thing,

2064
00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:17.270
right.

2065
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:19.070
Like they know that they're,

2066
00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:19.840
there was,

2067
00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.400
people would mix things together.

2068
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:24.280
There was sometimes they would mix certain psychedelics,

2069
00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:25.403
they would mix,

2070
00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:26.410
you know,

2071
00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:27.071
different things.

2072
00:58:27.071 --> 00:58:32.071
Like even bad ideas like people of mixed mushrooms and a Iowasca and apparently

2073
00:58:32.501 --> 00:58:34.690
that's not a good idea that really fucks you up.

2074
00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:37.480
But they uh,

2075
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:39.010
they don't know what the combination was.

2076
00:58:39.011 --> 00:58:40.220
They don't know what Soma meant,

2077
00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:41.350
but whatever it was,

2078
00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:42.610
it was the continental.

2079
00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.080
It was unbelievably profound.

2080
00:58:44.081 --> 00:58:44.860
It was like,

2081
00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:46.840
it was one of the most important things that,

2082
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.400
that existed in the world.

2083
00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:51.880
And we don't know what the fuck are doc is this good question.

2084
00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:55.600
I don't know if I could tell you that if under the Duncan Trussell was here,

2085
00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.350
he snap that shut off and I,

2086
00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:03.460
I forgot the name of the plant that the tightness snorted up there now is these,

2087
00:59:03.461 --> 00:59:06.100
there's been so many throughout history,

2088
00:59:06.101 --> 00:59:08.140
but for us in this day and age,

2089
00:59:08.141 --> 00:59:10.060
it's fascinating to me that we're the,

2090
00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:11.290
as far as we know,

2091
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.890
we're the furthest along without any catastrophe where they've,

2092
00:59:14.891 --> 00:59:19.090
we've managed to evolve culture to this crazy point of infinite and information,

2093
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:21.620
just distribution of it instantaneously.

2094
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:27.130
<v 1>And yet we still at this day and age ridicule that idea.</v>

2095
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:31.790
We ridicule these incredibly potent,

2096
00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.140
creative,

2097
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:35.180
inspiring experiences,

2098
00:59:35.181 --> 00:59:37.490
mind and life changing experiences.

2099
00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:38.750
And as a culture,

2100
00:59:38.751 --> 00:59:39.770
we be little them.

2101
00:59:39.771 --> 00:59:39.951
We,

2102
00:59:39.951 --> 00:59:40.181
we,

2103
00:59:40.181 --> 00:59:42.230
we make it down to like a joke.

2104
00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:42.950
You're high.

2105
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:43.191
Yeah.

2106
00:59:43.191 --> 00:59:44.420
And if you talk about it,

2107
00:59:44.421 --> 00:59:47.210
you're a silly person and you're not to be taken seriously.

2108
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:47.840
Right.

2109
00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:48.171
You know,

2110
00:59:48.171 --> 00:59:48.441
I've,

2111
00:59:48.441 --> 00:59:50.600
I've had conversations with people where they,

2112
00:59:50.601 --> 00:59:50.901
you know,

2113
00:59:50.901 --> 00:59:51.201
they said,

2114
00:59:51.201 --> 00:59:51.321
well,

2115
00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:54.190
what is it really changed the way you look at the life the most?

2116
00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:57.320
I'm like psychedelic experiences and they look at you like you just said

2117
00:59:57.321 --> 00:59:58.640
something fucking,

2118
00:59:58.641 --> 01:00:00.430
you did your burn doing heroin.

2119
01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:00.770
Yeah.

2120
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:00.981
Yeah.

2121
01:00:00.981 --> 01:00:01.191
You're,

2122
01:00:01.191 --> 01:00:01.430
you're,

2123
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:04.100
you're smoking meth and run into the wall.

2124
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.910
Like you're an idiot.

2125
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:05.091
Like,

2126
01:00:05.091 --> 01:00:05.780
Oh God.

2127
01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:07.130
She's just really just say that.

2128
01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:07.850
Like,

2129
01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:09.490
it's not even something people,

2130
01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:12.080
most people are ignorant to what the,

2131
01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:16.340
the true experience is really all about and ignorant to how long they've

2132
01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:20.930
probably been a part of human history and what they've probably shaped if human

2133
01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:21.764
history.

2134
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:23.780
There's no,

2135
01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.613
that's true.

2136
01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:25.693
I Dunno.

2137
01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:29.780
I find too that there is a huge resistance toward it.

2138
01:00:29.781 --> 01:00:32.660
I talk about it sometimes and I've done them.

2139
01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.113
Um,

2140
01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.990
and once you've done them and seen the alternate reality that exists and,

2141
01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.840
and kind of come in touch with that,

2142
01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:47.020
it does change your point of view because you realize that everything is so

2143
01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:51.320
fluid and that's levels of consciousness and not just the one horrible one that

2144
01:00:51.321 --> 01:00:52.280
we're stuck in all the time.

2145
01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:53.960
Now we're frauding each other.

2146
01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.110
There's,

2147
01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:55.640
you know,

2148
01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.020
varied levels of existence.

2149
01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.360
It's a real uncomfortable idea for a lot of people,

2150
01:00:59.361 --> 01:01:00.020
Joe.

2151
01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:00.380
Yeah.

2152
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.460
Because it fucks up there.

2153
01:01:01.461 --> 01:01:04.640
Well ordered life or their belief system or whatever it is they're going for.

2154
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.863
And um,

2155
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:07.910
people prefer faith based staff,

2156
01:01:07.911 --> 01:01:11.360
which is weird to me because it's easier to just accept.

2157
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.841
Well,

2158
01:01:11.841 --> 01:01:12.081
I mean,

2159
01:01:12.081 --> 01:01:14.390
it doesn't require a gyration aghast gas as much,

2160
01:01:14.391 --> 01:01:19.391
but I hadn't quite considered as much as she had the idea that psychedelic drugs

2161
01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:19.940
shapes him.

2162
01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:20.631
Many ideas.

2163
01:01:20.631 --> 01:01:22.400
But now that you mentioned that,

2164
01:01:22.401 --> 01:01:23.300
of course it's true.

2165
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.330
You don't need an alien invasion.

2166
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:26.910
Do,

2167
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:29.990
you can get an alien invasion in an hour and 20 minutes.

2168
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:30.440
Okay.

2169
01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:30.680
Yeah.

2170
01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.170
Seven grams going an isolation tank.

2171
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.140
You'll have a fucking alien very well.

2172
01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:36.170
And it'll happen.

2173
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.750
It'll happen in your brain.

2174
01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:38.310
Really.

2175
01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:39.260
It'll be real.

2176
01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:39.680
Yeah.

2177
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.260
Like whether or not it's actually physically happening,

2178
01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:43.750
who cares what's happening?

2179
01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.050
That's the subjectivity of it.

2180
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:46.280
It's just a hallucination.

2181
01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.230
Says who and who cares.

2182
01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:48.561
Okay.

2183
01:01:48.561 --> 01:01:49.910
Because either way it's happening,

2184
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:50.720
whether,

2185
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.460
whether or not you want to say it didn't really,

2186
01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:56.210
it wasn't really happening or whether you want to say that you really were

2187
01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:58.310
experiencing something that was real,

2188
01:01:58.311 --> 01:02:00.950
that you could only see while you're under the influence of the mushroom.

2189
01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:02.810
But it's real and around you all the time,

2190
01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.430
whichever one that is.

2191
01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:09.110
Either way you have the experience and the experience is incredibly powerful

2192
01:02:09.111 --> 01:02:09.381
and,

2193
01:02:09.381 --> 01:02:09.710
and,

2194
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:10.543
and,

2195
01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:12.590
and beneficial to you as a human.

2196
01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.290
I think it is because it opens up your mind.

2197
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.890
I think people are terrified to lose their ego.

2198
01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.740
You know what I mean?

2199
01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.010
Cause

2200
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.180
<v 2>if you're IGA dissolves,</v>

2201
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:22.010
then you're in a,

2202
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:26.310
in another state where you can't control your emotions and then all the things

2203
01:02:26.311 --> 01:02:29.100
that you're repressing and suppressing come rushing back.

2204
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:34.260
And for some people they're tenuously cleaned to reality at all times anyway.

2205
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.290
And a push like that threatens them.

2206
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:39.090
And like you say,

2207
01:02:39.091 --> 01:02:40.440
it gets lumped in with heroin.

2208
01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:41.730
It's not actually,

2209
01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:42.331
you know,

2210
01:02:42.331 --> 01:02:44.570
like we always argue that marijuana is,

2211
01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.040
is a mild hallucinogenic and you know,

2212
01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:47.874
therefore

2213
01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.740
a safer and fun or alternative to being drunk,

2214
01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:53.460
uh,

2215
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.480
unnecessarily or blah,

2216
01:02:54.481 --> 01:02:54.601
blah,

2217
01:02:54.601 --> 01:02:55.140
blah.

2218
01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.070
As Louis Armstrong said,

2219
01:02:56.071 --> 01:02:56.670
what it's worth,

2220
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:58.080
it's worth a hundred assistants,

2221
01:02:58.590 --> 01:02:59.290
uh,

2222
01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:00.870
worth a hundred assistance.

2223
01:03:00.871 --> 01:03:01.704
Yeah,

2224
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:02.510
he said,

2225
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:03.210
I don't know.

2226
01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:03.511
Oh No.

2227
01:03:03.511 --> 01:03:04.031
He would have said it's,

2228
01:03:04.031 --> 01:03:05.280
it's better than a hundred whiskeys.

2229
01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:05.850
Sorry.

2230
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:08.670
He said he always considered it a friend and assistant.

2231
01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:09.091
Oh,

2232
01:03:09.091 --> 01:03:09.600
that's funny.

2233
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.560
Which I thought was really funny,

2234
01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:11.611
but it's like,

2235
01:03:11.611 --> 01:03:12.780
it's Alex or like if you say,

2236
01:03:12.781 --> 01:03:13.740
if you took psychedelics,

2237
01:03:13.741 --> 01:03:14.340
uh,

2238
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.173
people go,

2239
01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:16.501
you know,

2240
01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.334
you're a drug addict.

2241
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:18.321
<v 0>Well,</v>

2242
01:03:18.321 --> 01:03:19.011
if you smoke weed,

2243
01:03:19.011 --> 01:03:19.844
you're a pothead.

2244
01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:20.271
You know,

2245
01:03:20.271 --> 01:03:21.190
when I am dead,

2246
01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.430
I am as well.

2247
01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:24.590
But what I found out that you were,

2248
01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.060
uh,

2249
01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:25.761
I thought,

2250
01:03:25.761 --> 01:03:26.030
uh,

2251
01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:26.331
when,

2252
01:03:26.331 --> 01:03:26.450
uh,

2253
01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:30.020
I found out that you were the one who actually did you introduce Doug Benson to

2254
01:03:30.021 --> 01:03:30.854
marijuana?

2255
01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:31.700
<v 2>That's the legend.</v>

2256
01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.910
If you saw that Warner Hertzog movie,

2257
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:35.450
uh,

2258
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:36.920
it's written on one of the cave walls.

2259
01:03:36.921 --> 01:03:37.754
There's a,

2260
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:41.360
there's a Petroglyph of Doug and I stylized of course,

2261
01:03:41.361 --> 01:03:42.570
you can't hardly recognize it.

2262
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.520
You can see my glasses.

2263
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:46.490
It's a from hundreds of years ago.

2264
01:03:46.491 --> 01:03:49.730
And Doug and I were in San Diego at the Pacific Beach Improv.

2265
01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.600
If you remember that one.

2266
01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:50.961
No,

2267
01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:51.381
I don't.

2268
01:03:51.381 --> 01:03:53.330
Well there was this 58,

2269
01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:55.023
um,

2270
01:03:55.610 --> 01:03:58.460
we had just finished doing a roast at the friars net.

2271
01:03:58.461 --> 01:03:58.690
We,

2272
01:03:58.690 --> 01:03:59.490
um,

2273
01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:00.670
we're playing San Diego in a,

2274
01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.810
he claims that he had smoked before,

2275
01:04:02.811 --> 01:04:03.471
but not on high.

2276
01:04:03.471 --> 01:04:03.921
You know what I mean?

2277
01:04:03.921 --> 01:04:05.210
Like he'd had some,

2278
01:04:05.211 --> 01:04:06.350
so cause a lot of times,

2279
01:04:06.351 --> 01:04:06.561
you know,

2280
01:04:06.561 --> 01:04:09.230
you'll have to get high a few times before it kicks in.

2281
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:10.733
Uh,

2282
01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.990
and then I brought a bunch of weed and I remember what I remember is the Condo

2283
01:04:14.991 --> 01:04:18.650
was near the beach and we just fucking do forces and you know,

2284
01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.960
we would just go to the beach every day you get high.

2285
01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.100
And then when we weren't at the beach,

2286
01:04:22.101 --> 01:04:24.560
we would watch MTVs beach party.

2287
01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:25.580
Oh my God.

2288
01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:28.760
I remember him laying on the couch laughing hysterically at one point and

2289
01:04:28.761 --> 01:04:29.680
kicking his legs in the other.

2290
01:04:29.681 --> 01:04:30.051
And I was like,

2291
01:04:30.051 --> 01:04:31.130
let's go get fish tacos.

2292
01:04:31.131 --> 01:04:31.521
And he was like,

2293
01:04:31.521 --> 01:04:31.941
dude,

2294
01:04:31.941 --> 01:04:32.181
you know,

2295
01:04:32.181 --> 01:04:32.720
and like,

2296
01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.390
it was just that stupid of a weekend.

2297
01:04:35.391 --> 01:04:35.541
We,

2298
01:04:35.541 --> 01:04:36.350
let's fucking,

2299
01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:39.230
and then at night we'd go desats we're working at the umbrella.

2300
01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:39.650
Right.

2301
01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:39.951
And,

2302
01:04:39.951 --> 01:04:40.220
uh,

2303
01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.780
he claims that was where he started.

2304
01:04:41.781 --> 01:04:46.781
And I guess the carefree lifestyle that we were living that week seduced him so

2305
01:04:46.791 --> 01:04:51.230
hard because if it's beguiling poetry that he realized he as an independent

2306
01:04:51.231 --> 01:04:51.531
soul,

2307
01:04:51.531 --> 01:04:53.180
he could finally take control of his own destiny.

2308
01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:57.410
But I had a kid say to me once where I was on the road and like Addison,

2309
01:04:57.411 --> 01:04:58.340
Texas or something,

2310
01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:01.470
and the guy who was working with a nice fellow and he would go out and you'd buy

2311
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.400
like peanut that I ran like cereal that you'd see on TV and stuff,

2312
01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.110
which made me laugh cause I'm from San Francisco,

2313
01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:06.321
you know,

2314
01:05:06.321 --> 01:05:06.650
and like,

2315
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:10.070
he would come back with like a shopping list you'd see on television,

2316
01:05:10.071 --> 01:05:11.240
like wonder bread and,

2317
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:12.830
and he's a nice fellow.

2318
01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:14.123
Uh,

2319
01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:14.991
and he would,

2320
01:05:14.991 --> 01:05:16.220
he would run and whatnot.

2321
01:05:16.221 --> 01:05:17.054
And I was late.

2322
01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:18.040
I remember what year it was.

2323
01:05:18.041 --> 01:05:18.191
It was,

2324
01:05:18.191 --> 01:05:22.150
I was watching the Nita Hill hearings on TV and that was a Raiders game that

2325
01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:24.850
weekend or a niners game and there was a fire in the East Bay and you could see

2326
01:05:24.851 --> 01:05:28.060
the fire boot camp last year was 90 90 91 somewhere in there.

2327
01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:29.200
Wow.

2328
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.060
Laying on the couch smoking weed and he goes,

2329
01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:33.370
you're going to smoke pot all fucking day proofs.

2330
01:05:33.371 --> 01:05:34.204
And I go,

2331
01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:35.380
let me ask you something.

2332
01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:36.101
Whatever his name was,

2333
01:05:36.101 --> 01:05:36.934
Danny,

2334
01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:37.813
again,

2335
01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.400
let me ask you something.

2336
01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:42.150
Who kills every night you do it?

2337
01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:43.483
<v 0>Ah,</v>

2338
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.210
you have your program.

2339
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:47.501
Well people,

2340
01:05:47.501 --> 01:05:48.180
it was born,

2341
01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:48.371
<v 2>Gee,</v>

2342
01:05:48.371 --> 01:05:49.530
that was trapped in the condo.

2343
01:05:49.531 --> 01:05:50.190
There was no,

2344
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:52.110
it was one of those ones that wasn't near anything.

2345
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:53.480
<v 0>Waffle house or something.</v>

2346
01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:58.570
But if you want it to be tactical about like a comics time creating,

2347
01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:01.900
it's all day and it's all day watching TV and you're,

2348
01:06:01.901 --> 01:06:05.510
you could be scanning for something that inspires you enough to be your next

2349
01:06:05.511 --> 01:06:06.344
closing bit.

2350
01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:07.550
So you're actually working.

2351
01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.320
So even when you're lounging,

2352
01:06:09.321 --> 01:06:09.990
you're working.

2353
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.361
<v 2>I see.</v>

2354
01:06:10.361 --> 01:06:11.730
If I think of stepping in Dad,

2355
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:14.550
I learned that if I wake up in the middle of the night,

2356
01:06:14.551 --> 01:06:15.270
I go,

2357
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:16.710
I need to do the thing tomorrow.

2358
01:06:16.770 --> 01:06:17.820
I have to think of this.

2359
01:06:17.821 --> 01:06:19.830
And then I think of it and you know,

2360
01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:20.913
I,

2361
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:22.560
I would argue that the creative process,

2362
01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.060
you can manufacture it.

2363
01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:24.890
Yes.

2364
01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:25.723
Um,

2365
01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:27.720
but it works better if you don't anyway.

2366
01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:28.591
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2367
01:06:28.591 --> 01:06:29.424
It's a,

2368
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.310
everybody goes dry.

2369
01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:31.410
Sometimes you gotta drive it.

2370
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:33.480
Also working hard makes you not go dry.

2371
01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:34.501
That's true too.

2372
01:06:34.501 --> 01:06:35.334
It's a muscle.

2373
01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:35.850
Yeah.

2374
01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:36.541
I think the,

2375
01:06:36.541 --> 01:06:36.840
the,

2376
01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.020
the is there's like a vibe that you get into when you're really writing a lot

2377
01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:42.580
and that vibe sort of like just it,

2378
01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.170
it,

2379
01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:45.870
it becomes like a part of your consciousness and then the,

2380
01:06:45.871 --> 01:06:48.090
the more you feed it and the more you do it,

2381
01:06:48.091 --> 01:06:50.220
I think that's what the thing with everything,

2382
01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:50.911
every,

2383
01:06:50.911 --> 01:06:52.200
everything that a person does,

2384
01:06:52.201 --> 01:06:54.930
whether it's an art form or a musical instrument,

2385
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:55.920
and if it isn't an art form,

2386
01:06:55.921 --> 01:06:56.840
it's not an important job,

2387
01:06:56.841 --> 01:06:57.181
but go on.

2388
01:06:57.181 --> 01:06:57.540
True.

2389
01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:58.373
It is true.

2390
01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:58.860
Yeah.

2391
01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:02.670
The idea of the creative process is something that's always been so fascinating

2392
01:07:02.671 --> 01:07:02.971
to me.

2393
01:07:02.971 --> 01:07:05.190
And like I love listening to how other people do it.

2394
01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.540
And especially comics,

2395
01:07:06.541 --> 01:07:07.890
like some of them are just fucking,

2396
01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:10.440
they just sit down and put in the time.

2397
01:07:10.441 --> 01:07:15.060
They just put in the hours and some of them just sit around and watch things all

2398
01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:18.090
day and scratch their head and look at the Internet and just poke around and

2399
01:07:18.091 --> 01:07:18.924
pride,

2400
01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:19.891
you know?

2401
01:07:19.891 --> 01:07:22.260
And then some of 'em they just,

2402
01:07:22.261 --> 01:07:22.650
uh,

2403
01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:23.890
they just write and,

2404
01:07:23.891 --> 01:07:24.780
and stand up for them.

2405
01:07:24.781 --> 01:07:26.280
Some people write in blog form,

2406
01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:31.410
<v 2>don't you love when you think a joke springs fully formed from your breast and</v>

2407
01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:34.030
you haven't thought of it,

2408
01:07:34.031 --> 01:07:36.400
it just comes out and do it and it's perfect.

2409
01:07:36.401 --> 01:07:37.234
And you go,

2410
01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:37.630
uh,

2411
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:38.800
like people always say,

2412
01:07:38.801 --> 01:07:39.634
you know,

2413
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.980
whatever,

2414
01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:40.813
the Beatles,

2415
01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:41.800
um,

2416
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.730
how did you write that song?

2417
01:07:42.731 --> 01:07:43.690
And sometimes don't call.

2418
01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:44.643
Honestly,

2419
01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.220
I sat down and,

2420
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:47.250
you know what I mean?

2421
01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:47.481
Yeah.

2422
01:07:47.481 --> 01:07:48.220
I had it.

2423
01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:49.060
I didn't write it.

2424
01:07:49.061 --> 01:07:49.790
I,

2425
01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:50.250
yeah,

2426
01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:51.083
it came out.

2427
01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:55.510
And like every once in a while there'll be a joke that you think of and it's

2428
01:07:55.511 --> 01:07:56.920
just the right one.

2429
01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:57.370
Yeah.

2430
01:07:57.370 --> 01:08:00.040
And it made it not be like genius or anything.

2431
01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:02.680
It's just that feeling of when it um,

2432
01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:04.450
that your,

2433
01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:09.280
that your subconscious pushed it out and you weren't fucking with it in any way

2434
01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:10.960
and therefore it's perfection.

2435
01:08:10.961 --> 01:08:12.290
It's different than something you work worked

2436
01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:12.970
<v 0>on.</v>

2437
01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:13.331
Yeah.

2438
01:08:13.331 --> 01:08:14.980
There's this weird thing of,

2439
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.670
again it goes back to the ego,

2440
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:21.350
this weird thing of what whoever the fuck you think of yourself as,

2441
01:08:21.351 --> 01:08:21.620
you know,

2442
01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.680
this self defining sort of image that you know,

2443
01:08:24.681 --> 01:08:26.900
you put up as like sort of a wall for touching.

2444
01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:27.830
Yeah.

2445
01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:30.380
And when you want to take credit for the idea,

2446
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:31.240
what would,

2447
01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:32.390
the way creativity comes,

2448
01:08:32.391 --> 01:08:34.730
it comes when you're in the state of like,

2449
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:37.190
like open when you're open to receive it.

2450
01:08:37.191 --> 01:08:40.550
When you're really thinking about things like completely all your resources are

2451
01:08:40.551 --> 01:08:41.384
on the thing.

2452
01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:42.590
Not about the bullshit,

2453
01:08:42.591 --> 01:08:46.700
not about like trying to craft an image on stage or trying to formulate

2454
01:08:46.701 --> 01:08:50.000
something that you think is going to make the back of the room laugh instead of

2455
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:50.501
that it's,

2456
01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:55.210
it's all coming from like a true openness and then they did.

2457
01:08:55.211 --> 01:08:57.170
It just comes like as you,

2458
01:08:57.290 --> 01:08:59.810
sometimes it's just like moments it,

2459
01:08:59.830 --> 01:09:00.200
you know,

2460
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:00.450
these,

2461
01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:03.860
these bursts of ideas will come to you and they are just gifts from the

2462
01:09:03.861 --> 01:09:06.650
university and they hit you like waves and he can't even write them down quick

2463
01:09:06.651 --> 01:09:09.830
enough and you're giggling while you're writing and it's like a gift.

2464
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:14.150
It's like a gift for thinking the right way or a gift for approaching it with

2465
01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:15.410
the correct respect.

2466
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:19.040
Like realizing that you are the lucky one to be able to tune into this.

2467
01:09:19.041 --> 01:09:23.120
It's not that you have this fabulous person who you know is so awesome because

2468
01:09:23.121 --> 01:09:23.990
you say funny shit.

2469
01:09:23.991 --> 01:09:24.140
No,

2470
01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:28.610
you're the lucky one that has found this ability to tune into these ideas and

2471
01:09:28.611 --> 01:09:31.430
you should praise these ideas and honor these ids.

2472
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:32.383
<v 2>That's true.</v>

2473
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:35.630
I think just pushing yourself to think of something.

2474
01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.730
I repeat myself a million times,

2475
01:09:37.731 --> 01:09:39.680
but to think of something new when you're riffing,

2476
01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.093
it's how I,

2477
01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:42.813
it's really hard,

2478
01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:44.510
like on the podcast,

2479
01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:45.050
I,

2480
01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:45.650
uh,

2481
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:49.010
I'll just attempt things sometimes that aren't that funny,

2482
01:09:49.190 --> 01:09:50.240
but I'm like trying to,

2483
01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:51.523
you know,

2484
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:54.400
like disconnect so that you're,

2485
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:55.790
you're kind of trying to automatic,

2486
01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:56.061
right.

2487
01:09:56.061 --> 01:09:56.720
If you can,

2488
01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:59.120
do you do your podcast entirely by yourself?

2489
01:09:59.150 --> 01:09:59.870
Yeah.

2490
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:00.410
Wow,

2491
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:00.981
that's awesome.

2492
01:10:00.981 --> 01:10:04.180
Talk to the crowd and I do it in front of a crowd always.

2493
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:05.260
Wow.

2494
01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:06.350
Solo is life.

2495
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:07.190
Whoa.

2496
01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:08.023
I want the live.

2497
01:10:08.690 --> 01:10:09.950
What do you do with that?

2498
01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.520
I prefer it's makes me more perform,

2499
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.821
you know,

2500
01:10:13.821 --> 01:10:15.610
I want to perform more and also,

2501
01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:16.491
I'm sorry,

2502
01:10:16.491 --> 01:10:16.791
where,

2503
01:10:16.791 --> 01:10:18.080
where do you want to thank you for asking.

2504
01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:18.831
I'm at the bar live.

2505
01:10:18.831 --> 01:10:20.060
It's tonight for goodness sakes.

2506
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.841
I did it at the bar,

2507
01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:22.370
the other two in La and I do it all of our,

2508
01:10:22.371 --> 01:10:22.730
what?

2509
01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:24.360
I love that place still in West Hollywood.

2510
01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.580
Orlewicz Lubitsch Ernst Lubitsch Lubitsch.

2511
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.790
Yeah.

2512
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:29.780
Lubitsch bar.

2513
01:10:29.781 --> 01:10:32.000
Lubitsch Lea bit.

2514
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:34.550
That sounds so hip and awesome.

2515
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:35.001
It's fun.

2516
01:10:35.001 --> 01:10:38.240
And then I get back in front of bar that backs like a nice low stage.

2517
01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.010
Greg Proops we'll be performing there.

2518
01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:41.700
You're doing your fucking podcast,

2519
01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:42.570
front of a live on it.

2520
01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:43.610
So to me,

2521
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:44.900
I need to like watch this now.

2522
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:46.250
I do that live and uh,

2523
01:10:46.251 --> 01:10:47.450
I'm liking this.

2524
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:52.100
This week I'm for London and I'm going to do it in Dublin this week and London,

2525
01:10:52.101 --> 01:10:52.934
England,

2526
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:55.550
Wieland's pub and Devlin and the 1910,

2527
01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:57.590
the Soho Theater in London on the second.

2528
01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.453
And then um,

2529
01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:00.410
then I come home and I go to Bloomington,

2530
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.891
Indiana,

2531
01:11:00.891 --> 01:11:01.431
the attic,

2532
01:11:01.431 --> 01:11:04.460
which is supposed to be a very nice club and I'm going to do the podcast there.

2533
01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.260
I tried to do it at every place I go.

2534
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:07.430
Oh.

2535
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:08.010
And a,

2536
01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:08.690
I do it live.

2537
01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:10.520
I take questions on the air,

2538
01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.080
never in la very much.

2539
01:11:12.081 --> 01:11:12.770
I've done it.

2540
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:13.650
I don't do that much.

2541
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:14.790
But now on the road,

2542
01:11:14.791 --> 01:11:18.300
always one part of the show as people get to get up and ask me questions.

2543
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:20.160
The show is called the smartest man in the world.

2544
01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:20.941
It's a joke.

2545
01:11:20.941 --> 01:11:22.160
I don't think I'm the smartest man unwell.

2546
01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:26.860
But you go on the radio and people go like sore you rule or the smartest man,

2547
01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:28.770
you're like,

2548
01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:29.640
no.

2549
01:11:29.641 --> 01:11:30.990
Are you the biggest Douche in the world?

2550
01:11:30.991 --> 01:11:32.610
Like who would do that?

2551
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.930
It's a joke obviously.

2552
01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:37.730
Obviously I have an attitude and I have some kind of comedy.

2553
01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:38.040
Yeah.

2554
01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:38.873
Yeah.

2555
01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:44.310
So I take questions and then I also take email questions and I read them and I

2556
01:11:44.311 --> 01:11:45.390
don't read them beforehand.

2557
01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:46.020
I just,

2558
01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:46.291
Oh,

2559
01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:46.890
that's great.

2560
01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:48.360
I read them on the air.

2561
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:49.171
So it's,

2562
01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:49.411
you know,

2563
01:11:49.411 --> 01:11:50.430
people will write me and now,

2564
01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:51.091
because you know,

2565
01:11:51.091 --> 01:11:51.370
it's,

2566
01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:54.640
it's been a couple of years now that it'll be like proof adopolis you know,

2567
01:11:54.641 --> 01:11:56.370
dear people of the sun,

2568
01:11:56.371 --> 01:11:57.150
you know,

2569
01:11:57.150 --> 01:11:57.990
perpendicular,

2570
01:11:57.991 --> 01:11:58.261
you know,

2571
01:11:58.261 --> 01:12:00.180
like trying to think of these lengthy.

2572
01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.040
So that part's fun.

2573
01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:04.560
And then they'll all read it back to the audience and then be like,

2574
01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:06.150
and then I'll try to answer it on the air.

2575
01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.270
So I got one once and I can't remember what it was.

2576
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:09.830
Oh.

2577
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:10.890
And it was a great question.

2578
01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:11.520
Uh,

2579
01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.440
I can't remember who wrote Matt or some short ones,

2580
01:12:13.441 --> 01:12:13.890
a little name.

2581
01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:14.281
In any case,

2582
01:12:14.281 --> 01:12:16.680
it was a beard's period.

2583
01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:20.550
Never question mark or beards period.

2584
01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.250
Never really question mark.

2585
01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:23.941
And I went,

2586
01:12:23.941 --> 01:12:25.500
that's not a question.

2587
01:12:25.501 --> 01:12:28.140
That's a series of extremely short sentences.

2588
01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:30.120
Uh,

2589
01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:30.953
and then I,

2590
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:36.110
I went in and maybe 25 minutes on this novel that I would write if you were with

2591
01:12:36.901 --> 01:12:40.260
me and how we go to Mendocino and get high.

2592
01:12:40.261 --> 01:12:40.810
And uh,

2593
01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:44.220
the whole going shopping and having a barbecue and drinking later.

2594
01:12:44.221 --> 01:12:48.420
And then that's why I wouldn't wear a beard because I would be scruffy at the

2595
01:12:48.421 --> 01:12:51.840
end of the four day and I'd be trying to write my novel and you'd be refuting my

2596
01:12:51.841 --> 01:12:54.330
novel as I read it to you first.

2597
01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:55.111
I wouldn't read it to you.

2598
01:12:55.111 --> 01:12:55.891
I'd be too precious.

2599
01:12:55.891 --> 01:12:57.300
And then upon demand on,

2600
01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:58.950
and this all came out of nowhere.

2601
01:12:58.951 --> 01:13:00.780
I have no intention of doing any of this.

2602
01:13:00.781 --> 01:13:01.470
And,

2603
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:03.300
and to me that's the jumping off point.

2604
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:03.960
Right?

2605
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.830
And it was the shortest,

2606
01:13:04.831 --> 01:13:05.670
stupidest thing.

2607
01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:08.790
And it was only because I'd said I didn't like beards on the show.

2608
01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:09.653
And like I said,

2609
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:10.620
I don't like hats,

2610
01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:11.100
you know,

2611
01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:11.950
or what is it?

2612
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:15.180
There's a few things I don't think men should wear.

2613
01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:18.930
Look what hats and beards and hats.

2614
01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.213
Um,

2615
01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:20.641
I don't,

2616
01:13:20.641 --> 01:13:22.830
I don't look at it and how people who look good in it.

2617
01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:23.910
I say wear a hat.

2618
01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:25.711
So,

2619
01:13:25.711 --> 01:13:27.120
but what if men want to wear a hat?

2620
01:13:27.121 --> 01:13:28.710
Because I just don't feel like combing their hair.

2621
01:13:28.711 --> 01:13:29.190
They just,

2622
01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:31.050
that's what I came as guys who wear baseball.

2623
01:13:31.051 --> 01:13:32.370
I'm not judgmental about right,

2624
01:13:32.371 --> 01:13:32.520
right.

2625
01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.250
Just where it just throw it all out right now.

2626
01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:38.050
He said that you,

2627
01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:40.150
you're attacking you also,

2628
01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:41.490
you're also at your show.

2629
01:13:41.491 --> 01:13:43.620
Like if you were going to go out with a girl,

2630
01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:45.970
would you wear your baseball ass?

2631
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:47.310
Why would dress exactly.

2632
01:13:47.311 --> 01:13:48.240
That was exactly,

2633
01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:48.970
I do it cause I,

2634
01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:50.760
I don't know if you want them to like you.

2635
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:51.710
I like to highlight,

2636
01:13:51.711 --> 01:13:51.870
come,

2637
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:52.640
listen.

2638
01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.120
Hi very easily.

2639
01:13:54.121 --> 01:13:55.290
I don't like to look at people.

2640
01:13:55.291 --> 01:13:56.190
If somebody is bothering me,

2641
01:13:56.191 --> 01:13:57.990
I don't want to deal with to cut them out.

2642
01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:00.750
I get that now those extraordinarily well.

2643
01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:01.441
Well,

2644
01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:02.274
okay it,

2645
01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.570
see my game is wrong.

2646
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:05.700
It's just his game is being him.

2647
01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.040
It's like your,

2648
01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:08.010
your game is you,

2649
01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:09.150
but your game is funny.

2650
01:14:09.151 --> 01:14:11.320
When you shit on other people who aren't doing your game.

2651
01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:14.110
Slogans of the show is I'm bound to shit on something you love.

2652
01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:14.641
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2653
01:14:14.641 --> 01:14:15.630
And what's wrong with that?

2654
01:14:15.631 --> 01:14:17.490
Why does everybody have such a hard time with that?

2655
01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:19.470
Everyone's so goddamn sensitive.

2656
01:14:19.471 --> 01:14:22.680
It's so silly if you can't laugh at someone making fun of you,

2657
01:14:22.681 --> 01:14:23.040
that you're,

2658
01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.240
you're being a silly person.

2659
01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:25.523
<v 2>I agree.</v>

2660
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.770
So that's how we get it and it's great fun.

2661
01:14:27.771 --> 01:14:31.280
And I get that sometimes people ask questions.

2662
01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.210
Uh,

2663
01:14:32.210 --> 01:14:35.540
I have no idea what they're going to say and it sounds amazing.

2664
01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.440
I've got a couple of running jokes that evolved,

2665
01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:40.280
evolved out of,

2666
01:14:40.281 --> 01:14:41.114
uh,

2667
01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:41.811
out of nowhere,

2668
01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:42.111
you know,

2669
01:14:42.111 --> 01:14:43.850
like just shit that I like to talk about.

2670
01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:46.700
And one of them is for some reason the Negro Leagues,

2671
01:14:46.701 --> 01:14:47.390
right?

2672
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:48.800
I'm a fan of baseball and I,

2673
01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.470
I started talking about Satchel Paige and Negro leaders in night.

2674
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:55.150
I play in Scotland a year ago and uh,

2675
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:56.990
well they don't know what the Negro Leagues are,

2676
01:14:56.991 --> 01:14:57.410
you know,

2677
01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:59.090
and a guy at the end of the show,

2678
01:14:59.091 --> 01:15:00.080
we're doing questions and he goes,

2679
01:15:00.081 --> 01:15:02.360
what about Satchel Paige?

2680
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:05.263
And you're like,

2681
01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:06.050
you know,

2682
01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:06.500
you cry.

2683
01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:09.260
A little wheelchair goes down my cynical face.

2684
01:15:09.261 --> 01:15:10.370
You've made a connection.

2685
01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:15.430
Podcasting is the coolest thing that comics have been able to do in the,

2686
01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:16.760
in my entire career,

2687
01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.800
Nolan in TV cooler then.

2688
01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:19.131
I mean,

2689
01:15:19.131 --> 01:15:19.911
I love the stage,

2690
01:15:19.911 --> 01:15:20.181
you know,

2691
01:15:20.181 --> 01:15:22.260
you can't pull me on fucking stage right.

2692
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:23.031
And the ham bone.

2693
01:15:23.031 --> 01:15:23.864
But I mean,

2694
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:25.723
podcasting by,

2695
01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:30.730
by a long mile is the most creative outlet I've had the most challenging.

2696
01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:32.000
Uh,

2697
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.680
doing it by myself with the crowd has been something I think I needed to do

2698
01:15:36.681 --> 01:15:38.000
forever and I don't,

2699
01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:39.830
didn't know that I needed to do that.

2700
01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:41.010
<v 0>That sounds amazing.</v>

2701
01:15:41.011 --> 01:15:42.000
Doing it the way you're doing.

2702
01:15:42.001 --> 01:15:45.930
It sounds really fun because it's like people have a chance to see different

2703
01:15:45.931 --> 01:15:50.790
ideas explored every week and doing it live in front of an audience like that.

2704
01:15:50.791 --> 01:15:53.640
Getting to see riff and just completely go off the cuff.

2705
01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:56.160
And knowing that it's absolutely completely off the cuff.

2706
01:15:56.161 --> 01:15:56.994
That's so fun.

2707
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:57.181
<v 2>I mean,</v>

2708
01:15:57.181 --> 01:15:59.970
I read pounds and newspaper articles and Hawaiian about it.

2709
01:15:59.971 --> 01:16:00.301
Shit,

2710
01:16:00.301 --> 01:16:00.601
you know,

2711
01:16:00.601 --> 01:16:03.880
it's one of the boring part.

2712
01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.233
Uh,

2713
01:16:05.370 --> 01:16:07.000
and then there's the questions and,

2714
01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:07.800
you know,

2715
01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:08.101
<v 0>yeah,</v>

2716
01:16:08.101 --> 01:16:08.590
the,

2717
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:09.730
the,

2718
01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:12.150
the podcasting thing is done.

2719
01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.250
The only thing that's like,

2720
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:15.600
in my opinion,

2721
01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:20.010
is truly complimentary to the standup because it really gets you to see the way

2722
01:16:20.011 --> 01:16:21.090
it guy's brain works.

2723
01:16:21.091 --> 01:16:25.350
Like one of the things I love about guys coming on that I haven't talked to

2724
01:16:25.351 --> 01:16:25.651
before,

2725
01:16:25.651 --> 01:16:26.161
like you,

2726
01:16:26.161 --> 01:16:30.000
like maybe we might have said like 10 words to each other ever that it comes

2727
01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:30.151
like,

2728
01:16:30.151 --> 01:16:30.480
hi,

2729
01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:30.990
what's up man?

2730
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:31.620
What's going on?

2731
01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.161
Everything cool.

2732
01:16:32.161 --> 01:16:32.820
You know?

2733
01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:33.210
Um,

2734
01:16:33.210 --> 01:16:33.721
is that,

2735
01:16:33.721 --> 01:16:33.990
uh,

2736
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:36.480
when you get to compare and,

2737
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:37.000
uh,

2738
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:37.270
and,

2739
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:39.060
and like see the different,

2740
01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:42.540
it's very inspiring to listen to other people's creative process.

2741
01:16:42.810 --> 01:16:43.080
<v 2>Oh,</v>

2742
01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:43.830
well that's,

2743
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:44.461
it is,

2744
01:16:44.461 --> 01:16:45.294
I think it's,

2745
01:16:45.450 --> 01:16:47.910
I have been on so many different,

2746
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:48.210
uh,

2747
01:16:48.210 --> 01:16:53.210
comics podcast and that's the other fun as part of podcasting is it's giving the

2748
01:16:54.211 --> 01:16:57.570
audience something that they never had before when we were young and we would

2749
01:16:57.571 --> 01:17:01.320
listen to comedy albums or even guys get interviewed occasionally on TV or the

2750
01:17:01.321 --> 01:17:03.960
radio and exchange of ideas between comics.

2751
01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:05.430
You don't fucking hear it.

2752
01:17:05.431 --> 01:17:06.390
You never fucking heard it.

2753
01:17:06.391 --> 01:17:10.310
It was never a craft and people now people podcastings radio.

2754
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.641
Yeah,

2755
01:17:10.641 --> 01:17:10.971
it is.

2756
01:17:10.971 --> 01:17:12.410
It's an audio format or whatever.

2757
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:12.831
Largely,

2758
01:17:12.831 --> 01:17:14.900
but except for all right.

2759
01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.070
Um,

2760
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.850
I was looking at the camera.

2761
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:17.181
Who's here?

2762
01:17:17.181 --> 01:17:17.660
Yeah.

2763
01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:18.493
How's it going?

2764
01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:20.023
Hello.

2765
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:21.510
Sophisticated motherfucking,

2766
01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.510
I'll look at you and hug you.

2767
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:27.460
Hey,

2768
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:32.770
could you imagine if we had audio of like Kennison having a conversation with a

2769
01:17:32.771 --> 01:17:33.180
hex?

2770
01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:34.013
Right.

2771
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:35.600
We didn't get that.

2772
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:36.311
We the,

2773
01:17:36.311 --> 01:17:37.730
this is the dressing room,

2774
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.450
uh,

2775
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:39.010
for,

2776
01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:39.110
uh,

2777
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:40.250
the world finally.

2778
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:40.790
Uh,

2779
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:45.140
and that there's a lot of funny people who can express themselves in this format

2780
01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.153
and that,

2781
01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:47.970
because it's like a,

2782
01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:48.591
you know,

2783
01:17:48.591 --> 01:17:49.670
whatever the,

2784
01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:55.120
there's a neph rules that make it work because it's Mike's and it's audio and it

2785
01:17:56.181 --> 01:17:57.380
has to be a certain length.

2786
01:17:57.381 --> 01:17:58.550
It can't be seven hours,

2787
01:17:58.551 --> 01:17:59.060
you know,

2788
01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:00.650
unless you're making a right,

2789
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:01.011
you know,

2790
01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:01.970
the bender,

2791
01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:02.871
the thing is though,

2792
01:18:02.871 --> 01:18:05.180
little Sapelo listened to him at work a lot.

2793
01:18:05.670 --> 01:18:07.100
I can give them really long ones.

2794
01:18:07.101 --> 01:18:08.810
We do like three hours all the time.

2795
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:09.140
Oh,

2796
01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:09.500
I,

2797
01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:09.980
I've been,

2798
01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:14.180
I do an hour and a half at two and the two ones that I think are a little long,

2799
01:18:14.181 --> 01:18:14.931
cause it's just me,

2800
01:18:14.931 --> 01:18:16.940
like I say so often,

2801
01:18:16.941 --> 01:18:17.151
you know,

2802
01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:19.220
come on after an hour,

2803
01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:19.990
really?

2804
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.570
One day,

2805
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:20.901
dude.

2806
01:18:20.901 --> 01:18:21.710
You're like,

2807
01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:22.490
yeah,

2808
01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:23.810
but people say to me,

2809
01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.051
Oh,

2810
01:18:24.051 --> 01:18:27.520
I love the long ones because I drive three hours to work,

2811
01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.600
or I'm on the train for two hours.

2812
01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:32.290
Why did you do a fucking one hour and 10 minute one?

2813
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:35.690
I needed a one hour and 48 and in it.

2814
01:18:36.230 --> 01:18:39.110
And I think the other thing that's really cool is that they're free.

2815
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:42.470
Like that's a Oh really cool thing of repeating tag role.

2816
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:43.530
Like it's,

2817
01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.520
that's the connection that we get to deal with.

2818
01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:51.521
This TV is wonderful and a one day I'll be on it again.

2819
01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:52.543
But the,

2820
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:53.743
I think that,

2821
01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:54.260
uh,

2822
01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:57.920
the connection that we get with this is just a different thing altogether.

2823
01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:58.560
Yeah.

2824
01:18:58.560 --> 01:18:59.510
I completely agree.

2825
01:18:59.690 --> 01:19:03.800
It's a tell immediate and you get to see what the dude is really like,

2826
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.970
you know,

2827
01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:05.480
I need,

2828
01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.640
well I'm sure you do cheat you do you work lab all the time.

2829
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:12.850
But I meet at my podcast way different than I would approach standup standup.

2830
01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:14.093
Shall I go,

2831
01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:14.961
I'm backstage,

2832
01:19:14.961 --> 01:19:15.681
I look at my notes,

2833
01:19:15.681 --> 01:19:15.860
I've,

2834
01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:16.310
you know,

2835
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.611
drink,

2836
01:19:16.611 --> 01:19:17.340
whatever,

2837
01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:18.173
go on and do it.

2838
01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.513
Uh,

2839
01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.730
and then go back or maybe say hi to a few people at the podcast.

2840
01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.270
I go out in the audience before the show and talk to everybody.

2841
01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.080
Wow.

2842
01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.790
And then sometimes after the show too,

2843
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:33.110
so it's more of like a town hall meeting show starts.

2844
01:19:33.111 --> 01:19:33.890
It's not,

2845
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:37.730
Greg Proops is coming into the building and I fucking have met you.

2846
01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.630
And we'd like you go to England and English people sometimes they're a little

2847
01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:42.261
reticent,

2848
01:19:42.261 --> 01:19:42.561
you know,

2849
01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:45.320
that they're not ready for you to come up and go hi.

2850
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.891
And I'll say,

2851
01:19:45.891 --> 01:19:47.120
this is your punishment.

2852
01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:49.730
You have to meet me before I go up there.

2853
01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.510
And then they,

2854
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:51.290
you know,

2855
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:51.681
and then,

2856
01:19:51.681 --> 01:19:52.700
but afterwards they're like,

2857
01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:58.120
that was really different that he came up and talked to us and I don't spend a

2858
01:19:59.781 --> 01:20:00.471
year with everybody.

2859
01:20:00.471 --> 01:20:00.711
I go,

2860
01:20:00.711 --> 01:20:01.011
hi,

2861
01:20:01.011 --> 01:20:01.801
thanks for coming.

2862
01:20:01.801 --> 01:20:01.940
You know,

2863
01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:02.600
I'll were you,

2864
01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:07.600
but I touch everybody and it's made a huge difference to me as an a performer to

2865
01:20:08.431 --> 01:20:10.800
like that connection is something.

2866
01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:12.540
And I never had with the crowd before.

2867
01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:15.300
I was never the touchy high five.

2868
01:20:15.301 --> 01:20:15.691
Anybody,

2869
01:20:15.691 --> 01:20:16.524
dude.

2870
01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:17.490
No,

2871
01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:18.390
I mean I'm lovable.

2872
01:20:18.391 --> 01:20:18.961
Obviously.

2873
01:20:18.961 --> 01:20:19.261
I'm,

2874
01:20:19.261 --> 01:20:21.570
I'm almost irresistibly engaging Joe.

2875
01:20:21.571 --> 01:20:23.460
I think you found that have been the last two and a half hours.

2876
01:20:23.461 --> 01:20:24.630
But uh,

2877
01:20:24.650 --> 01:20:25.830
and your audience of course,

2878
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.390
I think fell in love right away.

2879
01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:27.721
Yeah,

2880
01:20:27.721 --> 01:20:28.650
they fell them up right away.

2881
01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:29.843
Um,

2882
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:30.833
they,

2883
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:31.990
<v 0>that's a great idea though.</v>

2884
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.940
It's contrary to the standard thing that they would always show up to preach us,

2885
01:20:36.941 --> 01:20:37.720
which was,

2886
01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:38.200
you know,

2887
01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.033
magic.

2888
01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.020
Keep them.

2889
01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:40.751
You don't want to see,

2890
01:20:40.751 --> 01:20:41.351
don't let them see.

2891
01:20:41.351 --> 01:20:42.190
You see,

2892
01:20:42.191 --> 01:20:43.240
you hear the wizard of Oz.

2893
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.750
Yeah.

2894
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:47.110
Like I started a introducing my friends at the shows.

2895
01:20:47.111 --> 01:20:48.090
Like we would do a scenario.

2896
01:20:48.091 --> 01:20:49.420
You are first and then I would,

2897
01:20:49.450 --> 01:20:49.721
yeah,

2898
01:20:49.721 --> 01:20:50.860
and I would get on the microphone.

2899
01:20:50.861 --> 01:20:51.220
There we go.

2900
01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:53.440
Don't you tell you think it's better if they hear your voice for the first time

2901
01:20:53.441 --> 01:20:53.921
when you were on stage.

2902
01:20:53.921 --> 01:20:56.780
I want you stop the crazy thinking that,

2903
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:58.780
that all that income to see you.

2904
01:20:58.860 --> 01:20:59.270
Yeah.

2905
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.700
Yeah.

2906
01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:00.950
They'll be disappointed.

2907
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:02.110
I'm glad to hear you're there.

2908
01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.660
All that and that you support the other people in the act.

2909
01:21:04.661 --> 01:21:05.231
It makes sense.

2910
01:21:05.231 --> 01:21:05.800
Yeah.

2911
01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.000
It makes that connection.

2912
01:21:07.690 --> 01:21:08.260
It does.

2913
01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:09.093
Instead of,

2914
01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:09.970
you know,

2915
01:21:09.970 --> 01:21:11.460
he plays clubs in colleges and they,

2916
01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:12.460
you come out,

2917
01:21:12.670 --> 01:21:13.190
I said,

2918
01:21:13.190 --> 01:21:13.501
see,

2919
01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:13.640
see,

2920
01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:13.990
<v 2>see,</v>

2921
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.660
see,

2922
01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:15.090
you know,

2923
01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:17.630
I can scarf and a grain elevator,

2924
01:21:17.631 --> 01:21:18.070
you know?

2925
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:19.200
I mean,

2926
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:20.480
I love Glamor.

2927
01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:21.261
I really do.

2928
01:21:21.261 --> 01:21:23.540
And I like to dress up a lot and everything that,

2929
01:21:24.190 --> 01:21:25.490
like you say that,

2930
01:21:25.491 --> 01:21:27.500
that old paradigm of Shit is this where it's,

2931
01:21:27.501 --> 01:21:28.334
you know,

2932
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:29.330
uh,

2933
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:31.830
they were saving you as this special treat coma,

2934
01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:33.170
block the ticket to see you,

2935
01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:33.591
man.

2936
01:21:33.591 --> 01:21:34.490
I know you're playing,

2937
01:21:34.730 --> 01:21:36.500
I saw you outside smoking a joint,

2938
01:21:36.650 --> 01:21:36.870
you know,

2939
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:39.830
like it's not that mystifying like we're not,

2940
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:42.940
I mean any standup it works because you have to have,

2941
01:21:43.090 --> 01:21:43.690
Ooh,

2942
01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:46.000
I thought it standard but works cause uh,

2943
01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:47.203
that's cool.

2944
01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.460
I think he's got a remote control.

2945
01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:50.050
No,

2946
01:21:50.050 --> 01:21:50.330
no,

2947
01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:51.163
he just touch them.

2948
01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:53.270
Some of them were on remote control or something.

2949
01:21:53.271 --> 01:21:54.120
Just did own thing.

2950
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:55.350
Anyway,

2951
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:57.470
I do that and I never would have done it before.

2952
01:21:57.471 --> 01:21:57.921
And like,

2953
01:21:57.921 --> 01:21:58.100
uh,

2954
01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:01.280
I played the Bell House in Brooklyn and I'm there again in January on the 19th.

2955
01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.320
If you're listening and um,

2956
01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:05.600
there's about 350 people and this is nice.

2957
01:22:05.730 --> 01:22:06.563
Wow.

2958
01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:07.101
You know,

2959
01:22:07.101 --> 01:22:12.101
I've done this a hundred fucking years and I can't draw big crowds anywhere in

2960
01:22:12.441 --> 01:22:12.801
the world.

2961
01:22:12.801 --> 01:22:13.011
You know,

2962
01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:14.150
like I play around the world,

2963
01:22:14.151 --> 01:22:16.430
but I don't get a thousand people ever.

2964
01:22:16.530 --> 01:22:16.650
And,

2965
01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:17.060
you know,

2966
01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:17.930
unless I'm with,

2967
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:18.833
you know,

2968
01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:19.790
you know,

2969
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:20.630
someone huge,

2970
01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:24.740
but to get that many people to come to the podcast and that's all it was.

2971
01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:26.450
And I did an hour and they're 45,

2972
01:22:26.451 --> 01:22:26.691
whatever,

2973
01:22:26.691 --> 01:22:26.871
you know,

2974
01:22:26.871 --> 01:22:29.600
as long enough to fucking charge people 20 months or whatever.

2975
01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:30.853
And uh,

2976
01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:34.430
I met everyone before and then afterward I talked to almost like everybody

2977
01:22:34.431 --> 01:22:38.180
didn't want her to talk and I stayed for hours like Babe Ruth and just fucking,

2978
01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:39.380
you know,

2979
01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:40.213
hey,

2980
01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.310
and people give you pictures and they talked to you and you just talk about him

2981
01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:43.581
and shit.

2982
01:22:43.581 --> 01:22:46.880
And I thought I would have never cared this much before.

2983
01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:47.830
What now?

2984
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:48.170
Like his,

2985
01:22:48.170 --> 01:22:49.190
I'm middle aged,

2986
01:22:49.191 --> 01:22:49.920
you know,

2987
01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.770
and I love comedy,

2988
01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:52.980
which he knows what they mean.

2989
01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:53.980
Oh,

2990
01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:54.330
absolutely.

2991
01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:55.370
Want to be a comedian.

2992
01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.580
And not that I didn't ever want to bet,

2993
01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.420
but I don't know Joe,

2994
01:22:59.630 --> 01:22:59.991
my,

2995
01:22:59.991 --> 01:23:00.291
you know,

2996
01:23:00.291 --> 01:23:01.490
I did the first one,

2997
01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:02.180
the,

2998
01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:02.680
uh,

2999
01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:05.260
Mountain Ryan who produced Judge Benson's show,

3000
01:23:05.770 --> 01:23:06.190
uh,

3001
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:07.360
<v 1>and Jimmy Pardot show,</v>

3002
01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:07.850
uh,

3003
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:08.531
came to me and said,

3004
01:23:08.531 --> 01:23:09.131
you want to do show?

3005
01:23:09.131 --> 01:23:09.510
And I was like,

3006
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:10.000
well,

3007
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:10.840
what do I do?

3008
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:11.890
And they go wall,

3009
01:23:11.890 --> 01:23:12.131
you know.

3010
01:23:12.131 --> 01:23:12.401
And I said,

3011
01:23:12.401 --> 01:23:13.090
well no one will listen.

3012
01:23:13.090 --> 01:23:13.241
They'll go,

3013
01:23:13.241 --> 01:23:14.074
people listen to me.

3014
01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.280
And uh,

3015
01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:15.941
and then I,

3016
01:23:15.941 --> 01:23:17.440
we just had not to do interviews.

3017
01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:19.960
I'll do it on my own.

3018
01:23:20.230 --> 01:23:22.060
Cause I dentist audible show previously,

3019
01:23:22.061 --> 01:23:24.160
like in the old days when we were overfunded on the web,

3020
01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.590
I did audible.com yeah,

3021
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.740
yeah.

3022
01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:29.530
They had a bunch and I've got to do one and they paid me good money in the whole

3023
01:23:29.531 --> 01:23:33.990
thing and nobody listened cause no one had phones then it was 2000 till 2005

3024
01:23:33.991 --> 01:23:34.970
they were really innovators.

3025
01:23:34.971 --> 01:23:35.490
So they didn't,

3026
01:23:35.490 --> 01:23:36.400
nobody had a,

3027
01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.690
no one even had mp3s.

3028
01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:39.880
I mean like the Ed iPods video you'd have to down,

3029
01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:40.211
you know,

3030
01:23:40.211 --> 01:23:40.361
my,

3031
01:23:40.361 --> 01:23:44.050
Steve Marmel had some sort of a deal with them where he did a two minutes of new

3032
01:23:44.051 --> 01:23:45.130
content and I meet you.

3033
01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:46.630
I did it every like me,

3034
01:23:46.631 --> 01:23:47.380
Steve,

3035
01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:49.150
I know they wanted you to do a cheer at the time.

3036
01:23:49.151 --> 01:23:50.470
I've never been crazy though,

3037
01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.270
how much new standup.

3038
01:23:52.271 --> 01:23:54.580
So I took that for fucking five years.

3039
01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:55.241
So I thought,

3040
01:23:55.241 --> 01:23:56.410
well I'll just do that.

3041
01:23:56.411 --> 01:23:57.520
But like in an expanded,

3042
01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.760
but let's make it fun and have drinks and so the audience can have a drink and

3043
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:03.763
we all login.

3044
01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:05.950
How do you handle photographs before the show?

3045
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:07.540
At the podcast?

3046
01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:09.940
Nobody really wants to do them before they kind of want to do in there,

3047
01:24:09.941 --> 01:24:10.330
I'm sure.

3048
01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:11.090
Really?

3049
01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:11.610
Yeah.

3050
01:24:11.610 --> 01:24:15.420
Usually I think it feels like as soon as I don't like it at a standup shows

3051
01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:15.880
much.

3052
01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.380
I mean after I'll do that afterwards,

3053
01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.800
after I,

3054
01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:19.241
let me,

3055
01:24:19.241 --> 01:24:20.710
I know wine for a fucking minute.

3056
01:24:20.711 --> 01:24:21.190
William,

3057
01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:23.890
I always say hi to.

3058
01:24:23.891 --> 01:24:27.160
I have like a big line of people after they left.

3059
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:28.250
Did you have a tank?

3060
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:30.220
I don't hear anybody else that that does it.

3061
01:24:30.221 --> 01:24:31.510
I love hearing that you do that.

3062
01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:31.631
Well,

3063
01:24:31.631 --> 01:24:32.830
I do it at the podcast for sure.

3064
01:24:32.831 --> 01:24:33.650
I've standup show I'm,

3065
01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:36.850
you may not be so lucky that I do it at almost every standup show unless there's

3066
01:24:36.851 --> 01:24:37.684
something going on.

3067
01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:38.171
You know,

3068
01:24:38.171 --> 01:24:39.850
you're like a gentleman and philosopher,

3069
01:24:39.851 --> 01:24:40.091
you know,

3070
01:24:40.091 --> 01:24:40.341
you,

3071
01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:41.174
you your,

3072
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:46.470
your job now is so important for what you've been doing and it's the culmination

3073
01:24:47.321 --> 01:24:48.154
of all,

3074
01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:48.730
you know,

3075
01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:50.020
the TV and all that.

3076
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:51.610
This is the reward.

3077
01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:53.261
You know,

3078
01:24:53.261 --> 01:24:55.660
like you're saying you're rewarded by a gas.

3079
01:24:55.661 --> 01:24:56.494
Yeah.

3080
01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:58.720
You want to talk to everybody,

3081
01:24:58.721 --> 01:24:59.260
your show man,

3082
01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.310
they want to cap to you.

3083
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:01.720
That's how important you are to them.

3084
01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:02.081
Yeah,

3085
01:25:02.081 --> 01:25:02.914
I know.

3086
01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:05.710
I don't think if this is a reward I think of this is just a,

3087
01:25:05.711 --> 01:25:09.280
I just found like a real cool spot to expand.

3088
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:11.320
All right then it's the culmination

3089
01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:14.410
of all your thoughts.

3090
01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.440
We'll just fortunate that something came along that would lend itself to someone

3091
01:25:20.531 --> 01:25:23.290
who has so many different weird ideas in their head.

3092
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.691
Yeah.

3093
01:25:23.691 --> 01:25:27.250
You can't ever do in the form of like a radio show.

3094
01:25:27.251 --> 01:25:28.420
You haven't caught up to us yet.

3095
01:25:28.450 --> 01:25:31.030
We're still running wild were stolen and wild man.

3096
01:25:31.031 --> 01:25:34.660
This is still gangster pirate stuff and everybody thinks it's all,

3097
01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:35.261
you know,

3098
01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:37.960
the 30 somethings who who cover us,

3099
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:39.010
uh,

3100
01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:42.610
are already hip to the jive but they don't realize that the whole world doesn't

3101
01:25:42.611 --> 01:25:44.120
know about podcasting at all.

3102
01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:46.390
World doesn't need a huge coming up.

3103
01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:48.760
They're blowing up and you know what else is happening.

3104
01:25:48.761 --> 01:25:52.030
Podcasts are feeding other podcasts are finding about like,

3105
01:25:52.031 --> 01:25:57.031
we have had so many guys come from this podcast and then start their own and

3106
01:25:57.191 --> 01:25:58.860
then we help push their pockets.

3107
01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:02.800
To me it's an insane reached people.

3108
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:04.100
Your circle is

3109
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:04.510
<v 2>uh,</v>

3110
01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:05.343
uh,

3111
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:06.283
you know,

3112
01:26:06.610 --> 01:26:07.380
well they always say,

3113
01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:07.910
ah,

3114
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:08.510
uh,

3115
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:10.760
every scene needs a club house and this is the clubhouse,

3116
01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:11.570
right?

3117
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:12.770
This is the scene.

3118
01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:13.311
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

3119
01:26:13.311 --> 01:26:13.531
the,

3120
01:26:13.531 --> 01:26:14.331
the ice houses.

3121
01:26:14.331 --> 01:26:14.610
Uh,

3122
01:26:14.610 --> 01:26:15.980
it's such an awesome place to,

3123
01:26:15.981 --> 01:26:19.060
because it's been around since like 1961 or something like,

3124
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.160
oh,

3125
01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.390
I played here in 54.

3126
01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.840
They have this faith healing.

3127
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:25.310
If you go into the ice house,

3128
01:26:25.311 --> 01:26:26.690
like you step into that showroom,

3129
01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:30.770
that's a feeling like that place has been performed in for decades.

3130
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:32.210
You feel it.

3131
01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:32.520
I mean,

3132
01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:33.650
it sounds crazy.

3133
01:26:33.651 --> 01:26:34.670
I know it sounds crazy,

3134
01:26:34.671 --> 01:26:36.740
but there's a happiness in that room,

3135
01:26:36.741 --> 01:26:37.310
man.

3136
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:38.270
That's a and Bible building.

3137
01:26:38.271 --> 01:26:39.104
We have a show there tonight.

3138
01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:40.760
Joe Diaz is going to be there.

3139
01:26:40.761 --> 01:26:41.810

3140

Adam Hunter,

3141

3142
01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:47.893
Um,

3143

Greg Fitzsimmons that I mentioned him already.

3144
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:50.833
Who else?

3145
01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.970
So you're having trouble with some other people.

3146
01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:55.130
It got some solid fucking performers.

3147
01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:55.281
Oh,

3148
01:26:55.281 --> 01:26:57.080
Thompson Jura is going to be here to least gentlemen.

3149
01:26:57.081 --> 01:26:57.914
You don't want to miss that.

3150
01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:58.850

Tickets still available@americancomedycode.com.

3166
01:27:20.951 --> 01:27:21.784
Surely not.

3167
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:22.730
<v 0>And if you've never been there,</v>

3168
01:27:22.731 --> 01:27:24.020
it's an amazing little club.

3169
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:24.150
It's,

3170
01:27:24.150 --> 01:27:25.070
I have not been there.

3171
01:27:25.071 --> 01:27:26.460
What's it like straight here?

3172
01:27:26.461 --> 01:27:26.831
It goes up.

3173
01:27:26.831 --> 01:27:27.664
Beautiful place.

3174
01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:29.020
Drive San Diego.

3175
01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:29.721
What's it?

3176
01:27:29.721 --> 01:27:30.230
Love it.

3177
01:27:30.230 --> 01:27:30.920
I love it.

3178
01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:31.790
The American comedy company,

3179
01:27:31.791 --> 01:27:33.800
he's a real low ceiling.

3180
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:34.760
Tight seating.

3181
01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:37.850
Go down squares a very solid,

3182
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:39.440
I really wished them all the best.

3183
01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:41.750
And apparently there's another place called madhouse comedy.

3184
01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:42.080
Yeah,

3185
01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:42.913
down the street.

3186
01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:45.020
I was in old town.

3187
01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:46.220
Yeah.

3188
01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:46.700
Um,

3189
01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:47.121
I don't know.

3190
01:27:47.121 --> 01:27:49.150
It's an area where people walk

3191
01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.840
<v 2>for American comedy goes that gas lamp.</v>

3192
01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:51.733
And uh,

3193
01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:53.110
I remember where the other place,

3194
01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:53.660
okay.

3195
01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:54.500
It's the shit.

3196
01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:56.240
It's San Diego is awesome.

3197
01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.670
It's really a bad ass suit ages.

3198
01:27:58.760 --> 01:27:59.593
It's just,

3199
01:27:59.610 --> 01:27:59.991
it's funny,

3200
01:27:59.991 --> 01:28:02.180
20 years ago or when are,

3201
01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:02.780
you know,

3202
01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:04.250
50 years ago when I first started,

3203
01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:04.650
uh,

3204
01:28:04.650 --> 01:28:05.010
that,

3205
01:28:05.010 --> 01:28:06.530
that was a road Gig we always did.

3206
01:28:06.531 --> 01:28:07.880
There was a million gigs in San Diego.

3207
01:28:07.930 --> 01:28:09.830
Always played in La Jolla and fucking,

3208
01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:11.870
they started out in San Francisco,

3209
01:28:11.871 --> 01:28:12.100
right?

3210
01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:12.530
Yeah.

3211
01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:13.040
Yeah.

3212
01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.840
And our road gigs are all bay area and northern,

3213
01:28:14.841 --> 01:28:15.051
you know,

3214
01:28:15.051 --> 01:28:15.561
in Oregon,

3215
01:28:15.561 --> 01:28:15.891
Reno,

3216
01:28:15.891 --> 01:28:16.570
that kind of,

3217
01:28:16.570 --> 01:28:19.210
<v 0>I started my show business career in San Francisco as well,</v>

3218
01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.190
where a fisherman's wharf.

3219
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:22.330
I was eight years old.

3220
01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:23.590
I had a magic show.

3221
01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:24.400
Really?

3222
01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:24.521
Yeah.

3223
01:28:24.521 --> 01:28:25.060
That was my,

3224
01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:25.893
that's how I started.

3225
01:28:27.130 --> 01:28:27.521
I did,

3226
01:28:27.521 --> 01:28:29.110
I said I had a magic show.

3227
01:28:29.230 --> 01:28:29.780
I would let,

3228
01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:30.940
somebody gave me a magic show,

3229
01:28:31.170 --> 01:28:32.080
like a thing,

3230
01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:33.490
a little top hat and shit.

3231
01:28:33.630 --> 01:28:34.940
So I'd go out and get,

3232
01:28:35.190 --> 01:28:36.250
get donations.

3233
01:28:37.330 --> 01:28:37.901
It's ridiculous.

3234
01:28:37.901 --> 01:28:39.040
Why were you living in San Francisco?

3235
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.430
Yeah,

3236
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:42.400
I lived in San Francisco when I was a kid from age seven to 11.

3237
01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:43.001
Oh,

3238
01:28:43.001 --> 01:28:43.690
that's cool.

3239
01:28:43.690 --> 01:28:44.560
Fascinating Times.

3240
01:28:44.561 --> 01:28:49.330
It was right when the Vietnam War was ending and a really interesting living in

3241
01:28:49.331 --> 01:28:54.220
San Francisco like that young of my life during that era and the seventies

3242
01:28:54.221 --> 01:28:55.670
really shaped my,

3243
01:28:55.671 --> 01:28:55.781
uh,

3244
01:28:55.781 --> 01:28:57.400
I was going to say it to you at all.

3245
01:28:58.650 --> 01:28:59.483
It did a lot.

3246
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.670
There was a lot of,

3247
01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:02.880
especially my attitude towards gay people,

3248
01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:04.260
I've never understood.

3249
01:29:04.290 --> 01:29:05.670
I grew up with gay people.

3250
01:29:05.671 --> 01:29:07.920
So like to me it was always normal.

3251
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.940
And by the way,

3252
01:29:08.941 --> 01:29:10.500
it was always something that you can make fun of.

3253
01:29:10.501 --> 01:29:11.790
As long as you're not being a dick about it.

3254
01:29:11.791 --> 01:29:12.900
You can make fun of everything.

3255
01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:14.280
And this,

3256
01:29:14.281 --> 01:29:16.200
the idea of a homophobia,

3257
01:29:16.201 --> 01:29:19.680
I didn't even know it existed until I was about 13 or 12.

3258
01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:20.160
12.

3259
01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.270
I was in Florida hanging around with my keys.

3260
01:29:22.271 --> 01:29:23.104
The Dawn,

3261
01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:24.930
my parents moved to Florida.

3262
01:29:24.931 --> 01:29:26.340
We moved from San Francisco to Florida.

3263
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.233
And um,

3264
01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:29.340
there's a Cuban friend of mine,

3265
01:29:29.370 --> 01:29:30.290
his dad fuck it,

3266
01:29:30.291 --> 01:29:31.710
through the newspaper on the table.

3267
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.660
I can't fucking believe this shit.

3268
01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:34.830
He was so mad.

3269
01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:35.730
And he goes,

3270
01:29:35.730 --> 01:29:37.950
they're going to let these faggots marry each other.

3271
01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:39.540
And I remember I was,

3272
01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:40.530
I was like 12 years old.

3273
01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:40.921
I was like,

3274
01:29:40.921 --> 01:29:42.540
what the fuck do you care?

3275
01:29:42.541 --> 01:29:43.140
Like what,

3276
01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:44.190
what are you nuts?

3277
01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:45.320
You're going,

3278
01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:46.680
you're why you care.

3279
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.270
Like gay guys want a marriage.

3280
01:29:48.271 --> 01:29:48.451
It like,

3281
01:29:48.451 --> 01:29:48.900
what did,

3282
01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:49.710
it was weird.

3283
01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:50.071
I was like,

3284
01:29:50.071 --> 01:29:51.000
this poor guy's like,

3285
01:29:51.090 --> 01:29:52.160
he's broken or something.

3286
01:29:52.161 --> 01:29:52.351
It's like,

3287
01:29:52.351 --> 01:29:53.640
this is my friend's dad.

3288
01:29:53.641 --> 01:29:54.474
Like what an idiot.

3289
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.430
And that I remember thinking,

3290
01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:58.320
it took me a while to realize it,

3291
01:29:58.321 --> 01:29:58.771
but I was like,

3292
01:29:58.771 --> 01:29:58.981
wow,

3293
01:29:58.981 --> 01:30:02.400
people are way stupider in Florida than they are in San Francisco.

3294
01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:05.640
It was like going from a completely different world.

3295
01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:08.100
San Francisco is in a very unusual place.

3296
01:30:08.150 --> 01:30:11.380
<v 2>It poison to you because I've never dropped the attitude from there.</v>

3297
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:12.230
I have never,

3298
01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:13.191
they all the,

3299
01:30:13.191 --> 01:30:15.500
all the information I believe in is from there.

3300
01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:16.550
High down.

3301
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.740
Uh,

3302
01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:17.141
it was a,

3303
01:30:17.141 --> 01:30:20.360
it's a huge rude awakening when you get into the world and realize that it ain't

3304
01:30:20.361 --> 01:30:22.220
that way and ain't that fucking way.

3305
01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.800
<v 0>It's amazing how places like San Francisco evolve.</v>

3306
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:28.640
Like you have these weird pockets of like really smart people and really cool

3307
01:30:28.641 --> 01:30:29.690
people and it's,

3308
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:31.820
it's like that whole area,

3309
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:32.510
the,

3310
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:34.160
the tech area with,

3311
01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:34.971
you know,

3312
01:30:34.971 --> 01:30:35.450
uh,

3313
01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:36.031
like we're the,

3314
01:30:36.031 --> 01:30:41.031
all those rich dudes live and like Palo Alto and Atherton and stuff like that,

3315
01:30:41.241 --> 01:30:41.461
that,

3316
01:30:41.461 --> 01:30:44.120
that area is filled with intelligent people.

3317
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:45.710
It's really amazing.

3318
01:30:45.711 --> 01:30:47.720
It's a to hotbed of interesting,

3319
01:30:47.721 --> 01:30:48.650
intelligent people.

3320
01:30:48.651 --> 01:30:49.400
It's weird.

3321
01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.080
And therefore the demands are different.

3322
01:30:51.081 --> 01:30:54.710
You're going to go to a place and they're going to have artisinal bread,

3323
01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:58.010
<v 2>salincha cheese and awesome wine.</v>

3324
01:30:58.011 --> 01:30:59.960
I realize it's also an economic thing,

3325
01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:01.160
but it's,

3326
01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:02.820
it's a cultural thing too.

3327
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:03.703
Uh,

3328
01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:04.623
um,

3329
01:31:05.230 --> 01:31:06.063
uh,

3330
01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:08.630
the sensitivity,

3331
01:31:08.631 --> 01:31:09.530
like you say,

3332
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:10.700
I didn't,

3333
01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:13.190
I didn't realize how red necky the world was.

3334
01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:17.330
And I used to say it years ago on stage when I played in England and stuff.

3335
01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.740
I'm always looking for a place that's not rednecky,

3336
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:20.870
but I never find it.

3337
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.290
I don't know if that's still true,

3338
01:31:24.291 --> 01:31:25.790
but you know,

3339
01:31:25.791 --> 01:31:26.930
you're just going to run into it.

3340
01:31:26.931 --> 01:31:27.860
It's just going to happen.

3341
01:31:28.210 --> 01:31:29.480
<v 0>This going to be a Yang.</v>

3342
01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:30.231
Well,

3343
01:31:30.231 --> 01:31:30.710
yeah,

3344
01:31:30.710 --> 01:31:32.020
there's always going to be Kimberly.

3345
01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:33.360
They're going to let faggots and Mary,

3346
01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:35.930
what it was Chris clue that wasn't the punter just said,

3347
01:31:35.931 --> 01:31:38.350
there's not going to make you a raging cock monsters.

3348
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:42.560
Why are we said the people that are worried about gay marriage or either really

3349
01:31:42.561 --> 01:31:45.850
dumb or secretly worried the dicks are delicious and there's,

3350
01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:46.730
there's no,

3351
01:31:46.730 --> 01:31:48.050
there's no other options.

3352
01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:48.291
No.

3353
01:31:48.291 --> 01:31:48.561
It's like,

3354
01:31:48.561 --> 01:31:48.951
why?

3355
01:31:48.951 --> 01:31:50.060
Why else would you care?

3356
01:31:51.370 --> 01:31:52.580
<v 2>Selling is about filling one.</v>

3357
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:53.280
But you know what?

3358
01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.320
I think that recently,

3359
01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:58.290
I don't want to ascribe too much to the last election,

3360
01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.740
but the last did,

3361
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:00.933
uh,

3362
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:04.810
was definitely a forum on that as well as about a million other issues.

3363
01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.960
But that was an issue that did get knowledge to gay,

3364
01:32:08.010 --> 01:32:11.200
a senator and Wisconsin and uh,

3365
01:32:11.890 --> 01:32:13.800
there's a bisexual congressperson,

3366
01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:15.100
which is hilarious.

3367
01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:15.461
Wow.

3368
01:32:15.461 --> 01:32:16.030
That's awesome.

3369
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:16.570
Yeah.

3370
01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:17.403
And

3371
01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.590
there's also a Buddhist from Hawaii.

3372
01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:21.970
Really interesting.

3373
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.990
And uh,

3374
01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:26.440
I think that really speaks to what's happening now.

3375
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:27.821
Incremental.

3376
01:32:27.821 --> 01:32:28.720
But it happened.

3377
01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:32.170
I feel like the gay marriage thing has always been like sort of a beach ball

3378
01:32:32.290 --> 01:32:34.630
that gets tossed in the air to distract people,

3379
01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.220
which is why it never gets resolved.

3380
01:32:36.221 --> 01:32:36.431
No.

3381
01:32:36.431 --> 01:32:37.480
And Bush didn't want to resolve.

3382
01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:40.300
Remember 2004 was about the Sankey marriage and then he didn't do shit.

3383
01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:42.610
Like he didn't do shit about abortion or anything else.

3384
01:32:42.611 --> 01:32:46.780
He actually didn't really do anything about any social issues and make people

3385
01:32:46.781 --> 01:32:47.740
wildly angry.

3386
01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:51.940
Was he the first guy that would let you really clearly see that the presidency

3387
01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:55.360
is not real and then like all those decisions are being made by other people?

3388
01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:55.721
Well,

3389
01:32:55.721 --> 01:32:57.400
I wasn't old enough to be with it.

3390
01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:58.091
I mean,

3391
01:32:58.091 --> 01:33:00.670
I was a teenager or a young,

3392
01:33:01.690 --> 01:33:04.330
beautiful teenage boy with legs,

3393
01:33:04.331 --> 01:33:08.650
like a slender impala as I slid through life and my Adidas.

3394
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.943
Um,

3395
01:33:09.970 --> 01:33:11.710
and I like the wind in the background.

3396
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:13.263
Yeah.

3397
01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:13.810
Duh,

3398
01:33:13.810 --> 01:33:14.160
Duh,

3399
01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:14.920
Duh.

3400
01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:15.753
Yeah.

3401
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:19.970
And I've got a long way to go.

3402
01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:21.940
Cool.

3403
01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:22.773
Thank you.

3404
01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:23.873
Very good to the,

3405
01:33:24.850 --> 01:33:26.620
I'll do Michael McDonald all day long.

3406
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:27.371
And,

3407
01:33:27.371 --> 01:33:28.204
uh,

3408
01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:28.840
yeah,

3409
01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:29.210
I went,

3410
01:33:29.210 --> 01:33:33.250
I went through Watergate when I was like early teenager and I remember it and I

3411
01:33:33.251 --> 01:33:36.730
remember the cynicism even 12 or 13,

3412
01:33:36.731 --> 01:33:37.600
14 year old like,

3413
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:38.591
okay,

3414
01:33:38.591 --> 01:33:39.740
the president can be brought down,

3415
01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:40.930
the press has this power.

3416
01:33:41.410 --> 01:33:41.831
Uh,

3417
01:33:41.831 --> 01:33:42.730
the respect that,

3418
01:33:42.731 --> 01:33:43.990
that God in this country,

3419
01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:44.500
uh,

3420
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:48.430
the ending of the war and then watching the late seventies where we thought we

3421
01:33:48.431 --> 01:33:49.250
were going to have,

3422
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:49.810
uh,

3423
01:33:49.810 --> 01:33:50.800
the equal rights amendment,

3424
01:33:50.801 --> 01:33:52.420
we thought black people were going to be equal.

3425
01:33:52.421 --> 01:33:54.550
We thought Indians were going to get a piece of the pie.

3426
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:58.990
And then Reagan came along and all that kind of 60,

3427
01:33:58.991 --> 01:34:00.400
Steph got washed in the,

3428
01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:01.450
you took mushrooms,

3429
01:34:01.451 --> 01:34:03.070
bath and everybody,

3430
01:34:03.071 --> 01:34:03.380
the,

3431
01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:06.040
the media and the corporate entities and whatever.

3432
01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:06.761
That was I,

3433
01:34:06.761 --> 01:34:07.091
that was,

3434
01:34:07.091 --> 01:34:07.901
I think when I first,

3435
01:34:07.901 --> 01:34:09.820
I was probably 19 or 20 when Reagan got elected.

3436
01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:10.541
Like to me,

3437
01:34:10.541 --> 01:34:11.171
he was the first one.

3438
01:34:11.171 --> 01:34:12.004
I thought,

3439
01:34:12.490 --> 01:34:13.060
you're,

3440
01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:13.750
you know,

3441
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:15.110
you're not up to the job.

3442
01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:16.870
The mentally,

3443
01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:17.763
you know,

3444
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:21.370
that we're going to have you do it and you're just going to be this sort of

3445
01:34:21.371 --> 01:34:23.080
beautiful mountain of,

3446
01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:23.860
you know,

3447
01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:28.450
reassuring hooding for creepy moment because it was morning in America.

3448
01:34:28.490 --> 01:34:29.323
Do you remember that?

3449
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:30.880
One morning in America,

3450
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:35.380
that's what he called his presidency because Carter had such a bad recession and

3451
01:34:35.381 --> 01:34:38.300
couldn't get anything done and the Democratic Congress to fight and then it kind

3452
01:34:38.301 --> 01:34:39.850
of all went to shit by the end of the term.

3453
01:34:39.851 --> 01:34:40.684
Right.

3454
01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:42.290
And the passages,

3455
01:34:42.490 --> 01:34:43.270
the hostages,

3456
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.880
they cat.

3457
01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:45.580
And who knows what fucking happened,

3458
01:34:45.581 --> 01:34:45.851
right?

3459
01:34:45.851 --> 01:34:47.110
Whether Reagan got them released out,

3460
01:34:47.111 --> 01:34:47.800
ball of light.

3461
01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:48.700
In any case,

3462
01:34:48.970 --> 01:34:49.720
having said all that,

3463
01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:52.630
he called like his first term mourning in America.

3464
01:34:52.631 --> 01:34:54.670
Like we'd been in the darkness,

3465
01:34:54.671 --> 01:34:55.504
you know,

3466
01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:59.360
after it was clear that 12 years of Republican,

3467
01:34:59.361 --> 01:35:02.420
14 Years Republican presidency in Vietnam was the root of

3468
01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.393
<v 0>yeah,</v>

3469
01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:05.890
what had turned everything horrible.

3470
01:35:05.891 --> 01:35:10.891
The corrupt CIA and the drug dealing and a chicanery such an obvious narrative.

3471
01:35:11.770 --> 01:35:12.041
<v 2>Well,</v>

3472
01:35:12.041 --> 01:35:12.551
and then like,

3473
01:35:12.551 --> 01:35:15.430
so Bush for eight years of snatching,

3474
01:35:15.431 --> 01:35:15.851
grabbing,

3475
01:35:15.851 --> 01:35:18.820
making illegal war and fucking horrible,

3476
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.863
um,

3477
01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:24.960
fundamentalism and narrowness in the national dialogue.

3478
01:35:25.570 --> 01:35:26.403
And then,

3479
01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:26.891
you know,

3480
01:35:26.891 --> 01:35:29.170
the last four years people kind of okay.

3481
01:35:29.171 --> 01:35:30.580
And then the last election was like,

3482
01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:31.460
Eh,

3483
01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:32.590
it's clear again

3484
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:38.380
<v 0>that the big paradigm is shifting in the right direction.</v>

3485
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.720
Well,

3486
01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.030
something's going to have to happen.

3487
01:35:40.150 --> 01:35:42.520
I think socially it's certainly in the right direction.

3488
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:45.610
Or what old publicans are going to have to embrace gay marriage in medical

3489
01:35:45.611 --> 01:35:46.120
marijuana.

3490
01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.590
Those things are going to happen.

3491
01:35:47.650 --> 01:35:47.921
Yeah.

3492
01:35:47.921 --> 01:35:48.311
Well it should.

3493
01:35:48.311 --> 01:35:50.410
Abortion should be legal marijuana cause you know what?

3494
01:35:50.411 --> 01:35:51.460
It benefits everybody.

3495
01:35:51.461 --> 01:35:53.860
You don't think it does because you don't know how to use it.

3496
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.970
It's really that simple.

3497
01:35:54.971 --> 01:35:58.480
It's like saying that fucking saws shouldn't be legal because some people are

3498
01:35:58.481 --> 01:35:59.530
going to cut their feet off.

3499
01:35:59.610 --> 01:35:59.860
Well,

3500
01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:00.450
you know?

3501
01:36:00.450 --> 01:36:00.730
Yeah.

3502
01:36:00.730 --> 01:36:05.730
And it doesn't necessarily mean a crime wave that's going to be less crime.

3503
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:06.663
That's what you were saying.

3504
01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:07.660
You were going to be nicer.

3505
01:36:07.930 --> 01:36:08.290
Yeah.

3506
01:36:08.290 --> 01:36:11.530
What people don't understand is it marijuana unquestionably increases

3507
01:36:11.531 --> 01:36:12.280
sensitivity.

3508
01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.320
It changes the way you feel about things.

3509
01:36:14.321 --> 01:36:14.891
It makes you,

3510
01:36:14.891 --> 01:36:16.120
it makes you more sense.

3511
01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:17.320
It makes food taste better.

3512
01:36:17.650 --> 01:36:20.320
It just changes the whole dynamic of life.

3513
01:36:20.590 --> 01:36:22.990
And when something like that gets introduced in your system,

3514
01:36:22.991 --> 01:36:27.550
it gives you a new sense of understanding and that can help you and push you to

3515
01:36:27.551 --> 01:36:29.260
evolve your personality.

3516
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:31.090
That's it can be a good thing.

3517
01:36:31.091 --> 01:36:33.370
And even like when people talk about paranoia,

3518
01:36:33.371 --> 01:36:34.630
like they take it in to get paranoid.

3519
01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:37.300
It's not a bad thing to be paranoid every now and then.

3520
01:36:37.301 --> 01:36:38.830
Just get an accurate assessment,

3521
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.130
how fucking vulnerable you really are and how lucky you really are.

3522
01:36:42.131 --> 01:36:44.640
And maybe just turn that around and use it to,

3523
01:36:44.641 --> 01:36:45.000
to,

3524
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:45.231
to,

3525
01:36:45.231 --> 01:36:47.020
to be thankful and you know,

3526
01:36:47.021 --> 01:36:50.170
to push out positive energy because of that fucking paranoid.

3527
01:36:50.230 --> 01:36:52.390
Don't be scared of weed is what I'm trying to say.

3528
01:36:53.710 --> 01:36:54.460
They need it.

3529
01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:55.030
Uh,

3530
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:56.440
Cesar doubt fear the reefer.

3531
01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:58.450
He doesn't know the wound.

3532
01:36:59.250 --> 01:37:01.000
I don't think that's what they say,

3533
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:03.100
isn't it?

3534
01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:03.480
I don't know.

3535
01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:06.400
Maybe are seen as now it would've been a better song.

3536
01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:10.270
There's not that many really powerful songs about weed except rap songs.

3537
01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:13.060
Like you have to go to Cypress Hill if you really want to get a powerful song

3538
01:37:13.061 --> 01:37:13.370
about,

3539
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:14.150
here's the thoughts.

3540
01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:15.420
<v 2>[inaudible] uh,</v>

3541
01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:16.010
uh,

3542
01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:17.720
Jim about array for five feet long.

3543
01:37:17.721 --> 01:37:18.411
A little bit hot,

3544
01:37:18.411 --> 01:37:19.340
but not too strong.

3545
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:19.911
You'll be high,

3546
01:37:19.911 --> 01:37:21.530
but not for long if you're a viper,

3547
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:23.131
<v 0>what is that?</v>

3548
01:37:23.131 --> 01:37:23.964
Fats Waller.

3549
01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:24.813
Who is he?

3550
01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:27.330
<v 2>That's all I was a songwriter era and from Harlem,</v>

3551
01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:28.051
uh,

3552
01:37:28.051 --> 01:37:29.370
in the twenties and thirties.

3553
01:37:29.371 --> 01:37:31.170
I guess he died but one more choose pretty young.

3554
01:37:31.410 --> 01:37:33.480
And he wrote a honeysuckle rose and he wrote,

3555
01:37:33.481 --> 01:37:34.830
I hate you because your feet are too big.

3556
01:37:34.831 --> 01:37:35.664
And um,

3557
01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.140
he had a bunch of weed songs now.

3558
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.630
Dude.

3559
01:37:37.630 --> 01:37:39.690
You know so much about so much weird shit.

3560
01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:39.990
Well,

3561
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.950
I was going to say you do.

3562
01:37:40.951 --> 01:37:43.330
I mean I've never heard about Jane and [inaudible] and uh,

3563
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:43.630
uh,

3564
01:37:43.630 --> 01:37:44.431
you're insane.

3565
01:37:44.431 --> 01:37:44.930
Uh,

3566
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:47.250
a historian who dissected the Dead Sea Scrolls,

3567
01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:50.280
who's an Ingersoll as John Marco Allegro Allegro.

3568
01:37:50.281 --> 01:37:51.330
Why can't I think of a late round?

3569
01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:54.160
<v 0>These are just repeated subjects to death to me.</v>

3570
01:37:54.161 --> 01:37:57.870
It's so funny when I can explain it to somebody who's never heard them before

3571
01:37:57.871 --> 01:37:58.770
because I'm such a Dork.

3572
01:37:58.771 --> 01:38:02.130
That's all I think about is this shit I think about.

3573
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:07.410
It is funny how you can get on these like crazy paths of knowledge and store

3574
01:38:07.411 --> 01:38:10.310
weird shit that comes out and people were looking at like,

3575
01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:12.150
what the fuck do you know that format?

3576
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.641
<v 2>Right?</v>

3577
01:38:12.641 --> 01:38:13.061
People say,

3578
01:38:13.061 --> 01:38:13.871
why do you need other things?

3579
01:38:13.871 --> 01:38:16.390
Which I always think is funny cause the answer is easy cause I,

3580
01:38:16.391 --> 01:38:17.141
I'm learning.

3581
01:38:17.141 --> 01:38:17.760
Yeah.

3582
01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:18.001
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

3583
01:38:18.001 --> 01:38:21.260
Well for some people you can get stuck in a bad situation where you,

3584
01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:23.460
you showing up and you work with a bunch of dummies,

3585
01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:24.690
but it's a good job.

3586
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:25.701
And so you're,

3587
01:38:25.701 --> 01:38:26.910
you're on that vibe.

3588
01:38:26.911 --> 01:38:28.860
Like every day this talking to dumb,

3589
01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.210
uninterested people,

3590
01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:31.650
bored people,

3591
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:32.110
the,

3592
01:38:32.110 --> 01:38:32.521
you know,

3593
01:38:32.521 --> 01:38:33.240
and then you go home.

3594
01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:33.601
What do you do?

3595
01:38:33.601 --> 01:38:34.231
You Watch TV?

3596
01:38:34.231 --> 01:38:35.190
Like it's something,

3597
01:38:35.191 --> 01:38:36.570
it's hard to find a good conversation.

3598
01:38:36.571 --> 01:38:37.404
Sometimes

3599
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:39.380
<v 2>it is a,</v>

3600
01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:40.570
and that's the thing about,

3601
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.390
uh,

3602
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:44.310
the podcasts that makes it so interesting.

3603
01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:48.600
I mean a lot of Weirdos and people who come to my show or sometimes it's a

3604
01:38:48.601 --> 01:38:50.260
specific thing they want to talk about it.

3605
01:38:50.261 --> 01:38:51.270
Sometimes it's more general,

3606
01:38:51.271 --> 01:38:52.490
but you,

3607
01:38:52.690 --> 01:38:53.580
there's no lack of,

3608
01:38:53.581 --> 01:38:54.414
uh,

3609
01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:55.830
points of view and uh,

3610
01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.233
you know,

3611
01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:58.740
fields of interest.

3612
01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:01.740
People are throwing things at me all the time that I should talk about that I

3613
01:39:01.741 --> 01:39:03.090
don't know anything about,

3614
01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:03.391
you know,

3615
01:39:03.391 --> 01:39:04.080
what,

3616
01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:08.790
and then get string theory and David Foster Wallace and you know,

3617
01:39:08.791 --> 01:39:09.271
this is not,

3618
01:39:09.271 --> 01:39:09.660
and I'm like,

3619
01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:13.650
I don't fucking know anything about that and if we can just motor it in the

3620
01:39:13.651 --> 01:39:13.831
world.

3621
01:39:13.831 --> 01:39:15.210
So I tried to learn some things sometimes,

3622
01:39:15.211 --> 01:39:18.810
but I don't also don't want to be the person with a little bit of knowledge

3623
01:39:18.811 --> 01:39:21.690
about something and he gets everything wrong cause that's more annoying than,

3624
01:39:21.691 --> 01:39:22.440
uh,

3625
01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.730
than my usual pedantic.

3626
01:39:23.731 --> 01:39:25.230
I know everything about everything.

3627
01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.153
<v 0>Right.</v>

3628
01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:26.491
Yeah.

3629
01:39:26.491 --> 01:39:26.971
If you,

3630
01:39:26.971 --> 01:39:27.191
uh,

3631
01:39:27.191 --> 01:39:28.350
if you pretend you know more than,

3632
01:39:28.351 --> 01:39:28.890
you know,

3633
01:39:28.890 --> 01:39:29.723
<v 2>shut wrong,</v>

3634
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:32.710
you're shot down immediately to by a million people right now.

3635
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:33.360
<v 0>Good.</v>

3636
01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:34.140
You can't do it.

3637
01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:35.250
You should just Google it.

3638
01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:36.323
You should Google it.

3639
01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:36.971
<v 2>Well,</v>

3640
01:39:36.971 --> 01:39:38.110
no one can Google anything.

3641
01:39:38.111 --> 01:39:40.090
That's what I find so funny about the inner webs.

3642
01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:43.210
Everybody has a phone on them all the time and yet no one will look up.

3643
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:45.010
No one will click past the first link.

3644
01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:45.970
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

3645
01:39:45.970 --> 01:39:46.271
Well,

3646
01:39:46.271 --> 01:39:48.460
especially if you're asserting something silly.

3647
01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:49.793
Yeah.

3648
01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:50.010
Yeah.

3649
01:39:50.010 --> 01:39:50.441
This is,

3650
01:39:50.441 --> 01:39:51.274
um,

3651
01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:52.060
I dunno,

3652
01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:53.350
it's a real exciting time.

3653
01:39:53.351 --> 01:39:54.220
I think this,

3654
01:39:54.221 --> 01:39:54.431
uh,

3655
01:39:54.431 --> 01:39:54.641
the,

3656
01:39:54.641 --> 01:39:54.851
the,

3657
01:39:54.851 --> 01:39:55.091
the,

3658
01:39:55.091 --> 01:39:55.990
the ability to,

3659
01:39:56.190 --> 01:39:58.870
to have things like your podcast now where you could just,

3660
01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:02.500
it just gets released out into the world and then just picks up,

3661
01:40:02.590 --> 01:40:02.921
you know,

3662
01:40:02.921 --> 01:40:06.370
new viewers and he'd do something like this and I'm sure this is going to have a

3663
01:40:06.371 --> 01:40:10.480
bunch of people a download it now from iTunes and get hooked on it.

3664
01:40:10.481 --> 01:40:10.661
You know,

3665
01:40:10.661 --> 01:40:10.820
it's a,

3666
01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:11.470
it's a,

3667
01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:15.130
it's such a beautiful and neat path,

3668
01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:15.821
you know,

3669
01:40:15.821 --> 01:40:17.050
it's all so clean.

3670
01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.760
It's like direct to the artist.

3671
01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:20.050
Greg Proops takes it.

3672
01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:22.060
Greg Proops puts it online.

3673
01:40:22.210 --> 01:40:23.200
You download it,

3674
01:40:23.201 --> 01:40:24.400
you're connected or like,

3675
01:40:24.450 --> 01:40:24.521
oh,

3676
01:40:24.521 --> 01:40:24.850
like,

3677
01:40:24.850 --> 01:40:27.940
like with one step two is for you putting it up there.

3678
01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.820
Yeah.

3679
01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:30.350
<v 2>And you can listen to it at your discretion.</v>

3680
01:40:30.351 --> 01:40:31.430
You can fast forward it,

3681
01:40:31.431 --> 01:40:32.450
you can burn it,

3682
01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:34.520
you can copy it and send it to someone else.

3683
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:36.680
I'm sure people deal with you every once in a while.

3684
01:40:36.681 --> 01:40:38.390
This guy from like Sweden or something.

3685
01:40:38.930 --> 01:40:40.040
And I don't know how he found the,

3686
01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.000
he's on Facebook.

3687
01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.820
He'll do a Knicks would,

3688
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:46.850
there's like music behind a part of it and you go the stops really cool.

3689
01:40:46.851 --> 01:40:48.020
I wouldn't have thought of that,

3690
01:40:48.021 --> 01:40:48.560
you know?

3691
01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:48.710
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

3692
01:40:48.710 --> 01:40:50.700
Videos of rants have gone on live.

3693
01:40:50.701 --> 01:40:54.340
These like really become these really inspirational where someone spliced in

3694
01:40:54.341 --> 01:40:57.880
music and the Eisenhower speeches and it's fucking crazy shit man.

3695
01:40:57.881 --> 01:41:00.850
And it's all just people that connect to something on the,

3696
01:41:00.851 --> 01:41:01.684
on the Internet.

3697
01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.130
So we live in strange times.

3698
01:41:04.110 --> 01:41:04.741
<v 2>That's amazing.</v>

3699
01:41:04.741 --> 01:41:05.910
Isn't an exciting part.

3700
01:41:05.911 --> 01:41:08.970
Is like I'm ready for a lot of the old stuff to go away.

3701
01:41:09.330 --> 01:41:10.163
Yeah.

3702
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:11.791
I think,

3703
01:41:11.791 --> 01:41:12.260
uh,

3704
01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:13.440
I mean I have tradition,

3705
01:41:13.441 --> 01:41:15.690
obviously I write with a piece of paper and a pen.

3706
01:41:16.110 --> 01:41:16.651
Do you really?

3707
01:41:16.651 --> 01:41:17.290
Yeah,

3708
01:41:17.290 --> 01:41:19.900
<v 0>I feel like I can't write as fast that way.</v>

3709
01:41:19.901 --> 01:41:21.640
So the ideas slip away from me,

3710
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.110
but I do,

3711
01:41:23.130 --> 01:41:23.560
um,

3712
01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:26.790
write it down before I go on stage because when a,

3713
01:41:26.791 --> 01:41:27.790
especially new stuff,

3714
01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:30.790
I feel like if I don't physically write it down with a pen and a paper,

3715
01:41:30.791 --> 01:41:31.700
I don't remember it the same way.

3716
01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:32.620
<v 2>I,</v>

3717
01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.070
that's exactly what I was going to say,

3718
01:41:34.071 --> 01:41:34.490
Joe.

3719
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:37.430
I've done a survey of every comic I've talked to him the last two or three

3720
01:41:37.431 --> 01:41:37.940
years.

3721
01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:38.960
Every club I played,

3722
01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:42.200
I make everybody get their book out and show me how I go.

3723
01:41:42.201 --> 01:41:43.670
Where do you keep your ideas and everybody?

3724
01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:45.140
Yeah.

3725
01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:47.300
Book a little book with your lists on it.

3726
01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:47.600
Yup.

3727
01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:48.650
Minor on hotel rooms,

3728
01:41:48.670 --> 01:41:49.370
stationary.

3729
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:50.203
Thousands of them,

3730
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:51.950
thousands of pieces of paper.

3731
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:53.600
And I say,

3732
01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:54.590
why do you do it that way?

3733
01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:56.120
Do you ever ride it on your phone?

3734
01:41:56.121 --> 01:41:56.620
Yeah.

3735
01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:56.871
Uh,

3736
01:41:56.871 --> 01:41:58.250
if I think of a one line and I ride it,

3737
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.521
you know,

3738
01:41:58.521 --> 01:41:59.150
did it today.

3739
01:41:59.150 --> 01:42:00.410
But do you write your whole to the phone?

3740
01:42:00.411 --> 01:42:01.244
No.

3741
01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:05.450
In the end I have to put it on a piece of paper and read and I just think it's a

3742
01:42:05.451 --> 01:42:06.284
mental,

3743
01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.780
that's the really old fashioned part of performing.

3744
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:10.350
<v 0>I have a note,</v>

3745
01:42:10.351 --> 01:42:13.080
lists of set lists on my phone,

3746
01:42:13.081 --> 01:42:16.440
but I'll go to like right before I go on stage sometimes if I want to make sure

3747
01:42:16.441 --> 01:42:18.210
that I remember some new shit that I'm working on.

3748
01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:19.710
But when I write,

3749
01:42:19.711 --> 01:42:20.100
I go,

3750
01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:20.851
when are you going to that?

3751
01:42:20.851 --> 01:42:21.571
Like trance,

3752
01:42:21.571 --> 01:42:24.150
I can do that so much better when I'm typing because I can,

3753
01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:27.480
the words just appear like I can type a word in a,

3754
01:42:27.481 --> 01:42:28.290
in a second.

3755
01:42:28.290 --> 01:42:31.530
Whereas it takes the Kenyan remember if you type no,

3756
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:31.891
but,

3757
01:42:31.891 --> 01:42:33.150
but I can write better.

3758
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.641
So I,

3759
01:42:33.641 --> 01:42:36.660
I get the trance out and I can get more information out as I'm writing.

3760
01:42:36.661 --> 01:42:38.220
But then I go back and I'm like,

3761
01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:39.181
I fucking write that.

3762
01:42:39.181 --> 01:42:40.170
I remember writing that.

3763
01:42:40.171 --> 01:42:40.710
Like I'll,

3764
01:42:40.710 --> 01:42:42.840
I'll laugh at some of my own shit and then I'll go,

3765
01:42:42.841 --> 01:42:43.111
okay,

3766
01:42:43.111 --> 01:42:43.410
I got it.

3767
01:42:43.410 --> 01:42:44.460
That I've got to keep that part.

3768
01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:47.490
Cause I don't even remember writing cause I'd have five hours of writing.

3769
01:42:47.491 --> 01:42:48.810
How much do you actually remember?

3770
01:42:49.110 --> 01:42:49.560
But the,

3771
01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:53.190
the act of actually scribing it into a paper,

3772
01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:54.061
a piece of paper.

3773
01:42:54.061 --> 01:42:55.530
There's something about that that's like,

3774
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:57.290
it just really like residents.

3775
01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:59.490
It just stores in your memory that's like,

3776
01:42:59.491 --> 01:43:00.380
it's like a,

3777
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:02.940
we humans have been doing it that way for so long.

3778
01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:03.953
It's like

3779
01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:06.700
<v 2>math where it's been five,</v>

3780
01:43:06.710 --> 01:43:07.091
seven,

3781
01:43:07.091 --> 01:43:09.060
10,000 years since people started writing.

3782
01:43:09.061 --> 01:43:09.270
Yeah,

3783
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:12.160
I think there's a real profound connection with the paper.

3784
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:13.460
Yeah.

3785
01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:15.140
<v 0>Have you ever thought about releasing those?</v>

3786
01:43:15.170 --> 01:43:16.280
Like with your,

3787
01:43:16.281 --> 01:43:16.730
um,

3788
01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:17.930
like with a special,

3789
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:20.510
like when you release a special release your notes as well.

3790
01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:21.280
<v 2>Wow.</v>

3791
01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:22.030
Now I haven't,

3792
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:24.340
one time I did a fun article for Filter magazine.

3793
01:43:24.730 --> 01:43:25.840
The guy came over to me and he said,

3794
01:43:25.841 --> 01:43:26.674
how do you,

3795
01:43:26.770 --> 01:43:29.110
he saw me fumbling with my notes and I said,

3796
01:43:29.111 --> 01:43:30.640
it's all different pieces of hotel stationary.

3797
01:43:30.641 --> 01:43:32.020
So I asked my wife to pick it.

3798
01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:32.291
He goes,

3799
01:43:32.291 --> 01:43:33.400
well that will be the article.

3800
01:43:33.970 --> 01:43:35.890
Just I want a picture of these,

3801
01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:37.793
you know,

3802
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:39.190
notes as atlas.

3803
01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:40.180
And uh,

3804
01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:40.871
I said to my wife,

3805
01:43:40.871 --> 01:43:41.321
you pick it out.

3806
01:43:41.321 --> 01:43:42.880
I give her the folder full of shit.

3807
01:43:43.170 --> 01:43:44.710
And she picked out four random ones.

3808
01:43:44.711 --> 01:43:45.790
It was one from like Paris,

3809
01:43:45.791 --> 01:43:46.630
one from Minnesota,

3810
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:48.580
one from a place I didn't remember being,

3811
01:43:49.150 --> 01:43:51.380
it was like and somewhere,

3812
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:51.711
you know,

3813
01:43:51.711 --> 01:43:54.560
and then there was another one and then it just sad like Clinton,

3814
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:56.830
you know what on the like,

3815
01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:57.021
you know,

3816
01:43:57.021 --> 01:43:57.621
corn,

3817
01:43:57.621 --> 01:44:00.170
whatever the fuck was on the list to Olsen twins.

3818
01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:02.630
And I kind of went through the list as the article and just went like,

3819
01:44:02.810 --> 01:44:03.440
yeah,

3820
01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.060
I was doing Clinton jokes in Paris,

3821
01:44:05.061 --> 01:44:05.894
you know,

3822
01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:06.100
I,

3823
01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:06.850
well I think I slept.

3824
01:44:06.850 --> 01:44:07.100
Really,

3825
01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:09.980
it's always 92 when I rock the Mike Rock dumb luck or whatever,

3826
01:44:09.981 --> 01:44:10.251
you know,

3827
01:44:10.251 --> 01:44:11.084
like,

3828
01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:11.923
uh,

3829
01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:16.100
that there is a weird insight into kind of like what's going on exactly.

3830
01:44:16.101 --> 01:44:19.280
Then with all your setlist cause the different notes you make on them and stuff.

3831
01:44:19.610 --> 01:44:22.580
I don't know that there's not much to be garnered from,

3832
01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:23.841
I mean,

3833
01:44:23.841 --> 01:44:26.200
I could probably remember some of the bits and some I couldn't.

3834
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:28.190
So just something that might be cool,

3835
01:44:28.191 --> 01:44:30.910
like if I was a fan and I like how it yeah,

3836
01:44:30.911 --> 01:44:31.091
yeah,

3837
01:44:31.091 --> 01:44:31.281
yeah,

3838
01:44:31.281 --> 01:44:31.831
definitely.

3839
01:44:31.831 --> 01:44:32.720
And just see my old self,

3840
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:34.790
I put it up on line or something.

3841
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:37.030
If you just put the photos online,

3842
01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:39.980
do you ever see that a website called letters of note?

3843
01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:40.850
No.

3844
01:44:40.850 --> 01:44:41.211
Uh,

3845
01:44:41.211 --> 01:44:42.080
and there's another one,

3846
01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:43.070
something of note.

3847
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:44.090
Um,

3848
01:44:44.090 --> 01:44:48.050
but letters of notice letters people wrote to each other or even,

3849
01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:48.310
oh,

3850
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:50.120
I think there's one called lists of note.

3851
01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:50.811
And,

3852
01:44:50.811 --> 01:44:51.100
um,

3853
01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:54.130
the list of note is just different lists that famous people wrote or anybody you

3854
01:44:54.131 --> 01:44:54.230
know,

3855
01:44:54.230 --> 01:44:54.591
notable,

3856
01:44:54.591 --> 01:44:56.390
like the one I remember is felonious monk,

3857
01:44:57.230 --> 01:44:58.250
cause I read it on my show.

3858
01:44:58.700 --> 01:44:59.570
A blind is monk,

3859
01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.050
you know,

3860
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:00.740
uh,

3861
01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:02.840
he had different mental problems and stuff.

3862
01:45:02.841 --> 01:45:03.051
You know,

3863
01:45:03.051 --> 01:45:04.930
if you've ever seen him play like he played and then he said,

3864
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.500
get up and walk around the stage,

3865
01:45:06.501 --> 01:45:07.290
you know?

3866
01:45:07.290 --> 01:45:08.123
Yeah.

3867
01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:09.080
And he's extraordinary.

3868
01:45:09.081 --> 01:45:10.880
And then he was given drugs and they didn't quite work out,

3869
01:45:10.881 --> 01:45:11.540
but anyways,

3870
01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:12.390
a genius and he,

3871
01:45:12.391 --> 01:45:16.420
he could both compose and arrange and extemporize and his band was,

3872
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:16.610
you know,

3873
01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:17.443
kind of

3874
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:20.230
putting the position of having to deal with his,

3875
01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:21.650
his personality,

3876
01:45:21.651 --> 01:45:21.920
right?

3877
01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:22.071
Like,

3878
01:45:22.071 --> 01:45:24.160
cause he wasn't like a regular guy who,

3879
01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:24.591
hey,

3880
01:45:24.591 --> 01:45:24.920
let's,

3881
01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:25.131
you know,

3882
01:45:25.131 --> 01:45:25.964
I'll be there at five,

3883
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.301
you know,

3884
01:45:26.301 --> 01:45:29.840
he had to kind of be pushed around to places,

3885
01:45:29.841 --> 01:45:30.680
but then when he could play,

3886
01:45:30.681 --> 01:45:34.640
he was so he wrote a note and on the net it's just how do we address tonight?

3887
01:45:34.641 --> 01:45:35.750
Sharp as possible.

3888
01:45:35.751 --> 01:45:36.320
Underlined.

3889
01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:37.010
Right.

3890
01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:37.371
And then,

3891
01:45:37.371 --> 01:45:37.550
uh,

3892
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.821
if you're,

3893
01:45:37.821 --> 01:45:39.020
the drummer I think is something,

3894
01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:39.381
you know,

3895
01:45:39.381 --> 01:45:43.610
like there's all this like really broken down like the thoughts you have before

3896
01:45:43.611 --> 01:45:44.301
you go on stage,

3897
01:45:44.301 --> 01:45:47.080
like about the band and how he wanted the band to play and look.

3898
01:45:47.690 --> 01:45:48.410
And I would,

3899
01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:49.670
I would read that out sometimes.

3900
01:45:49.671 --> 01:45:51.050
And so I would say on the show,

3901
01:45:51.170 --> 01:45:53.300
how do we adjust tonight at sharp is possible.

3902
01:45:54.130 --> 01:45:54.380
Yeah.

3903
01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:54.950
Right.

3904
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:57.170
So there's lists of note and there's letters of note.

3905
01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:58.760
And then at the last letter of note,

3906
01:45:58.761 --> 01:45:59.630
someone sent it to me.

3907
01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:00.740
Uh,

3908
01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:01.460
was um,

3909
01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:06.460
Jackie Robinson went to a luncheon or a dinner at Ike was speaking at,

3910
01:46:06.621 --> 01:46:07.250
right.

3911
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:08.930
And Jackie was an executive.

3912
01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:09.650
Yeah.

3913
01:46:09.650 --> 01:46:11.870
Jackie Robinson was an executive at chock full of nuts.

3914
01:46:11.871 --> 01:46:12.291
Coffee,

3915
01:46:12.291 --> 01:46:12.620
right?

3916
01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:16.070
Like he got a job in the corporate world because he was an intelligent,

3917
01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:16.641
capable,

3918
01:46:16.641 --> 01:46:17.720
and famous person.

3919
01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:19.670
He became an executive,

3920
01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:21.110
a chocolate nuts in New York.

3921
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:26.750
And so he went to this like banquet and Eisenhower Spec and it was a lot of

3922
01:46:26.751 --> 01:46:29.780
black people there who were in business and Eisenhower said,

3923
01:46:29.781 --> 01:46:30.860
you've got to be patient,

3924
01:46:32.210 --> 01:46:33.043
right?

3925
01:46:33.050 --> 01:46:34.040
You'll chime will come.

3926
01:46:34.041 --> 01:46:34.874
And all that.

3927
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:36.410
This is the city's wow.

3928
01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:41.440
So Jackie wrote him a very respectful letter but also very pointed,

3929
01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:42.650
um,

3930
01:46:42.650 --> 01:46:43.970
about your patients.

3931
01:46:43.971 --> 01:46:44.804
You know,

3932
01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:46.190
and I'm not doing it any justice.

3933
01:46:46.191 --> 01:46:46.361
It was,

3934
01:46:46.361 --> 01:46:46.671
as you know,

3935
01:46:46.671 --> 01:46:46.860
Jim,

3936
01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:47.693
Mr President,

3937
01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:49.420
having recently attended the lunch out,

3938
01:46:49.421 --> 01:46:51.990
I have to say that on behalf of myself and my race,

3939
01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:54.030
the time for patients is long passed.

3940
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:57.690
You'll find that over the past several hundred years we've endured nothing but

3941
01:46:57.930 --> 01:46:58.790
countless indignant,

3942
01:46:58.791 --> 01:46:59.160
you know?

3943
01:46:59.160 --> 01:46:59.491
Right,

3944
01:46:59.491 --> 01:46:59.790
right,

3945
01:46:59.790 --> 01:47:00.570
right.

3946
01:47:00.570 --> 01:47:05.570
And then the repast is the next letter Eisenhower wrote him back.

3947
01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:06.631
Jim,

3948
01:47:06.631 --> 01:47:07.530
Mr. Robinson,

3949
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:08.550
thank you for your letter.

3950
01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:08.720
I,

3951
01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:11.430
as I take on board what you said and I profoundly,

3952
01:47:11.431 --> 01:47:11.671
you know,

3953
01:47:11.671 --> 01:47:12.770
Blah Blah Blah and like,

3954
01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:13.310
oh wow,

3955
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:17.700
this exchange in a very civil and high faluting language,

3956
01:47:17.730 --> 01:47:19.200
not the language that we use now,

3957
01:47:19.230 --> 01:47:21.780
but like formal letter writing language,

3958
01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:22.471
uh,

3959
01:47:22.471 --> 01:47:26.250
with the idea of very explicitly expressed that he no longer had the patients to

3960
01:47:26.251 --> 01:47:26.460
eight,

3961
01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:29.850
that he felt that why shitty way and why should you have to go to a dinner with

3962
01:47:29.851 --> 01:47:30.361
the president,

3963
01:47:30.361 --> 01:47:33.660
told him the way we need in the first fucking black guy in the big leagues and

3964
01:47:33.661 --> 01:47:36.330
they get a job and fucking business and you know,

3965
01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:37.740
trying to run his life and shit.

3966
01:47:37.741 --> 01:47:38.574
Right.

3967
01:47:39.810 --> 01:47:41.040
And Eisenhower like it.

3968
01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:41.551
Well,

3969
01:47:41.551 --> 01:47:42.384
you know,

3970
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:46.080
one day schools will be integrated and you want to have to drink it another

3971
01:47:46.081 --> 01:47:47.280
faucet and you know,

3972
01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:48.690
you don't want to hear that.

3973
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.130
And so those kinds of letters I think to me are like fascinating.

3974
01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:54.570
So letters of known enlisted node are quite good.

3975
01:47:54.571 --> 01:47:55.410
If you want to just,

3976
01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:57.150
you mean you don't have to read everything on it that it's,

3977
01:47:57.180 --> 01:48:00.210
it's different letters to people and that's fucking Badass.

3978
01:48:00.211 --> 01:48:00.810
Yeah,

3979
01:48:00.810 --> 01:48:02.400
I will check that nobody writes letters anymore.

3980
01:48:02.410 --> 01:48:02.620
In,

3981
01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:07.620
in future it will be your setlist of note and your emails of note and your blog

3982
01:48:07.711 --> 01:48:09.600
of note the probably be a letter.

3983
01:48:09.810 --> 01:48:10.111
Yeah,

3984
01:48:10.111 --> 01:48:10.944
it's going away.

3985
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:12.810
The physical act of writing is going away.

3986
01:48:12.811 --> 01:48:16.680
If I didn't have to write my set lists down or occasional like fill out a form,

3987
01:48:16.681 --> 01:48:18.180
like when I go to Canada or something like that,

3988
01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:18.830
I would,

3989
