00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:03.720
<v Speaker 1>What did you,</v>

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.300
<v Speaker 1>what is the big thing that you got out of this personally?</v>

4
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Or sort of intellectual above?</v>

5
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>intellectually as personally,</v>

7
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:10.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.423
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>

9
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

11
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>I'd been through sort of lifetime of,</v>

12
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

13
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>like I was a late bloomer as a kid.</v>

14
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm real small,</v>

15
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>always sort of the front of my school came into my,</v>

16
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>my throat,</v>

17
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>an average sized guy now,</v>

18
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>but I came to my growth really late and so I sort of have a basic,</v>

19
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.160
<v Speaker 1>schoolboy story about getting pushed around and bullied and,</v>

21
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.363
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

22
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>there's no heroism in that story that always backed down.</v>

23
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:39.620
<v Speaker 1>I always ran for it.</v>

24
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.170
<v Speaker 1>I always found some way out of it.</v>

25
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't because I was a pacifist.</v>

26
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like had some noble high minded reasons for avoiding the violence.</v>

27
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>It was that I was scared and I knew I was gonna get my ass kicked.</v>

28
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>But I've always kind of felt like that's no excuse for not for fighting,</v>

29
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.830
<v Speaker 1>that there's a huge,</v>

31
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>you should stand up to the bully.</v>

32
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt that way and even though I never did it so,</v>

34
00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

35
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>so part of what I wanted to do was I wanted to go into that cage and I wanted to</v>

36
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>sort of stand up to guys who were stronger than me and more skilled than me and</v>

37
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>sort of taken those beatings that I felt like I should have taken 20 years ago.</v>

38
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.843
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

39
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>and so as deep.</v>

41
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

43
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever had experience like that as a boy.</v>

45
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.013
<v Speaker 1>where were you?</v>

47
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Were you behaved in a fashion that you define as cowardly?</v>

48
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.791
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

49
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

50
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>And it's amazing to me.</v>

51
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm 42 years old now.</v>

52
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I've had a lot of accomplishments in my life,</v>

53
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>have a beautiful wife,</v>

54
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I have little children who are wonderful.</v>

55
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.420
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to me how much psychological weight that still carries from me that</v>

56
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>I could still meet myself,</v>

57
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:40.224
<v Speaker 1>blush,</v>

58
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>thinking back to those moments.</v>

60
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>And so part of it was a redemption story for me about whether I could,</v>

61
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>whether I could do something to redeem myself,</v>

62
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>at least in my own eyes for those times when I'd flinched a as a kid.</v>

63
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.861
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

64
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:53.551
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

65
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:54.570
<v Speaker 1>I love that you did that.</v>

66
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.411
<v Speaker 1>I don't love that.</v>

67
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>You're still blushing over it.</v>

68
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Silly social a little bit.</v>

69
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.131
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

70
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>But it just means you've got work to do.</v>

71
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.541
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

72
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

73
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>just kind of worked before you realize you're not that guy anymore.</v>

74
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.861
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

75
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:05.694
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

76
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>So when you're doing these heavy,</v>

77
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 1>heavy lifting,</v>

78
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.230
<v Speaker 1>it dead ends,</v>

79
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:11.130
<v Speaker 1>that impulse,</v>

80
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>it slows it down.</v>

81
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

82
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.640
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

83
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>not to mention you're neglecting the forefoot.</v>

84
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 1>All these exercises are pretty much done on the ball on the hill.</v>

85
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.791
<v Speaker 1>I was squatting.</v>

86
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I remember as you're,</v>

87
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>you're taught to press through that heel deadlifting the same thing.</v>

88
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.041
<v Speaker 1>So your,</v>

89
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:26.371
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

90
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>your training over and over these movements that are not practical for a sports</v>

91
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

92
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>which pretty much every sport is played on the forefoot.</v>

93
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

94
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:34.801
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

95
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Like he never really in a sport.</v>

96
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>You very rarely push off the back of the foot,</v>

97
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.570
<v Speaker 1>so kind of moving forward when you're punching the back heels off the ground.</v>

98
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:43.404
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

99
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>And so knowing that it's kind of like,</v>

100
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.190
<v Speaker 1>why are we doing this?</v>

101
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

102
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.030
<v Speaker 1>like w,</v>

103
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>

104
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.470
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>

105
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.303
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>

106
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>it's improper training.</v>

107
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:54.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really makes sense.</v>

108
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Mark has been preaching this for years and you know,</v>

109
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>and people of Scoff at it and you see now I got to get my heavy back squat and</v>

110
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.101
<v Speaker 1>that's fine,</v>

111
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>but maybe this can help you with it.</v>

112
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

113
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.270
<v Speaker 1>start training the feet,</v>

114
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>looking at looking at what we're talking about here and the sequence of muscles</v>

115
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to start firing when you do start training the feed,</v>

116
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.450
<v Speaker 1>like how is this a better option for squatting would be a front squat.</v>

117
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 1>And now let's say you take a couple of 45 pound plates and you put them under</v>

118
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>the balls of your feet.</v>

119
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>So now you're engaging more of a sports movie and you're on the balls of your</v>

120
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>feet and you're loading up the front instead of the back,</v>

121
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>which is the back squat is technically a lower back exercise.</v>

122
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>It really hits the lumbar and his lower back a lot.</v>

123
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

124
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 1>the front squat is going to hit more quadricep muscles required for jumping,</v>

125
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.553
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>

126
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>as well as the core and stabilizing the spine with the abdominals and</v>

127
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

128
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>So that's just a thought like maybe you can do that.</v>

129
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

130
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>start thinking in that process where you're training from the feet up the</v>

131
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.001
<v Speaker 1>forefoot up,</v>

132
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>not just the heels of the forefoot up and you'll start connecting different</v>

133
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>muscles require for sports movements.</v>

134
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.541
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

135
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

136
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.510

145
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:19.740
<v Speaker 1>is asking.</v>

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.753
<v Speaker 1>Gamer guy.</v>

167
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.360
<v Speaker 1>What a weird world we live in respect to the CS go communities.</v>

168
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>So is that Kevin's studio that we're looking at in the corner?</v>

169
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.903
<v Speaker 1>this is man cave.</v>

171
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.090
<v Speaker 1>This is one part of his studio.</v>

172
00:05:17.091 --> 00:05:20.660
<v Speaker 1>This is where he does all his twitch gaming and stuff in his podcast.</v>

173
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.040
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you think of in all these rooms,</v>

174
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like where did they rub one out?</v>

175
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:26.254
<v Speaker 1>Like what part of</v>

<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

180
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.161
<v Speaker 1>how can we do this?</v>

181
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Let's enter the Matrix.</v>

182
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.104
<v Speaker 1>We can somehow.</v>

183
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 1>There's a lag though.</v>

184
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>

185
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like seven to 10 seconds.</v>

186
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

187
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.180
<v Speaker 1>You just opened the floodgate of racist.</v>

188
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

189
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.953
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

190
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.900
<v Speaker 1>it's always racist stuff for some reason.</v>

191
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.080
<v Speaker 1>That's I subscribers Kevin.</v>

192
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.760
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

193
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

194
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.883
<v Speaker 1>not logged in.</v>

195
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Then Joe Rogan wants to the studio.</v>

196
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Are you logged in to see your studio?</v>

197
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.270
<v Speaker 1>The studio.</v>

198
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.511

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.180
<v Speaker 1>This is so bizarre.</v>

202
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like two mirrors facing each other.</v>
