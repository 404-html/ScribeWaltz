<v Speaker 1>no gluten free,</v>

149
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 1>fantastic mix of nutrients,</v>

150
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.863
<v Speaker 1>champion,</v>

151
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 1>antioxidant blend.</v>

152
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.160
<v Speaker 1>We have Peruvian Purple Corn Isi,</v>

153
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.003
<v Speaker 1>he fruit,</v>

154
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.150
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different antioxidants combined with the power green blend,</v>

155
00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>which is Spirulina,</v>

156
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Alfalfa,</v>

157
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:55.451
<v Speaker 1>old grass,</v>

158
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Kale and more.</v>

159
00:05:56.411 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 1>All this stuff is available.</v>

160
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>The information behind the is all available at [inaudible] dot com and it all is</v>

161
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>quite fascinating and it's really,</v>

162
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 1>really healthy stuff.</v>

163
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>And a great way to cover your bases.</v>

164
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>We would all like to get all of our nutrients from food if and whenever</v>

165
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:12.974
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

166
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a guy like Joel Salatin,</v>

167
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:15.891
<v Speaker 1>you can do that.</v>

168
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:20.891
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a guy out there on the move and maybe perhaps a mixing in some not</v>

169
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 1>so healthy food with,</v>

170
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

171
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.740
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

172
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 1>fresh fruits and vegetables and lean meats and proteins,</v>

174
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.751
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you,</v>

175
00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:31.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

176
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>you need to supplement and one of the best ways to stop them.</v>

177
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 1>And is this earth grown nutrients package.</v>

178
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Everything we sell it on it is stuff that either I use or Aubrey uses my,</v>

179
00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:45.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

180
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 1>my partner in on it and things that we have found that we have researched and</v>

181
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>things that we have found that there's science behind it.</v>

182
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:57.191
<v Speaker 1>If you go to any of the products like especially the things like Alpha brain,</v>

183
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:02.261
<v Speaker 1>which is a cognitive enhancing nutritive nutritional combination of things that</v>

184
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.680
<v Speaker 1>have all been shown to benefit memory with a nootropic is for folks who don't</v>

185
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>not familiar with the term nootropics,</v>

186
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:19.580
<v Speaker 1>are essentially nutrients that are,</v>

187
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 1>that have been found to enhance cognitive function.</v>

188
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.710
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is the all the building blocks for human neurotransmitters</v>

189
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.970
<v Speaker 1>to building blocks and enhance your memory.</v>

190
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>It can be very confusing,</v>

191
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.400
<v Speaker 1>but if you go to [inaudible] dot com and click on the Alpha brain link,</v>

192
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 1>there's actually a bunch of science behind it,</v>

193
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.930
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of research behind it,</v>

194
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

195
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.580
<v Speaker 1>with references.</v>

196
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.760
<v Speaker 1>We actually have done our own clinically based a double blind placebo study and</v>

197
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Speaker 1>those results are available at [inaudible] dot com and more studies are ongoing.</v>

198
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 1>It's all really fascinating stuff.</v>

199
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Cutting edge nutrition and um,</v>

200
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 1>controversial in a sense,</v>

201
00:07:57.801 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 1>but noncontroversial in the fact that we give you a 100 percent money back</v>

202
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:02.024
<v Speaker 1>guarantee.</v>

203
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Ninety days on the first 30 pills,</v>

204
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 1>you have a 100 percent money back guarantee.</v>

205
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to return your product.</v>

206
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:10.910
<v Speaker 1>He just have to say this stuff's bullshit.</v>

207
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.940
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

208
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:12.920
<v Speaker 1>then you get your money back.</v>

209
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

210
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that a is going naked or not having like the colored pills anymore</v>

211
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>because they're getting rid of the dyes and stuff.</v>

212
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:20.330
<v Speaker 1>That's actually on the pills.</v>

213
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

214
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

215
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.430
<v Speaker 1>We did that a while ago.</v>

216
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.293
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

217
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.890
<v Speaker 1>it's also because people like,</v>

218
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.570
<v Speaker 1>they look like when you look at it,</v>

219
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:27.430
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a,</v>

220
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.431
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

221
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:28.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

222
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Well Green.</v>

223
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.550
<v Speaker 1>And it was green and yellow and it doesn't look like ecstasy.</v>

224
00:08:31.551 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Speaker 1>It looks like I'm like a pharmaceutical,</v>

225
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:35.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

226
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.500
<v Speaker 1>it looks like something that you would get.</v>

227
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.050
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like earth grown nutrients.</v>

228
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like it's healthy.</v>

229
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:41.923
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

236
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.120
<v Speaker 1>I alluded yesterday that we've got some big news coming out.</v>

237
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be awhile before announced it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>on it in.</v>

240
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you too much about it,</v>

241
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:02.124
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

242
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:02.911
<v Speaker 1>it'll be,</v>

243

<v Speaker 1>Joel Salitan is here and we're going to talk to him and we're going to learn</v>

256
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:19.554
<v Speaker 1>some shit.</v>

257
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 2>The Joe Rogan experience</v>

258
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.290
<v Speaker 2>podcast by night.</v>

259
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.580
<v Speaker 1>A sure sign,</v>

260
00:09:30.581 --> 00:09:31.390
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

261
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.290
<v Speaker 1>that we live in a mad,</v>

262
00:09:32.291 --> 00:09:37.120
<v Speaker 1>mad world is when a person has seen ideas and he comes across as a revolutionary</v>

263
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 1>and I have Joel Saltz and for folks who don't know as an American farmer or</v>

264
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:48.050
<v Speaker 1>lecture or you're an author and your approach to farming is,</v>

265
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.640
<v Speaker 1>it's so natural and so normal.</v>

266
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.810
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

267
00:09:52.811 --> 00:09:53.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

268
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.590
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion noncontroversial that it's,</v>

269
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.880
<v Speaker 1>it's quite fascinating that in this day and age with this mad,</v>

270
00:10:00.881 --> 00:10:05.710
<v Speaker 1>mad world of factory farming and pumping these animals full of hormones and</v>

271
00:10:05.711 --> 00:10:07.690
<v Speaker 1>chemicals and antibiotics,</v>

272
00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:12.691
<v Speaker 1>that your approach has sort of revolutionized a lot of the ideas that people</v>

273
00:10:15.851 --> 00:10:16.810
<v Speaker 1>have about farming.</v>

274
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a real sign that there's something wrong with us.</v>

275
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:26.620
<v Speaker 1>When I watch your methods and I've seen your videos and I've heard you talk on</v>

276
00:10:26.621 --> 00:10:27.040
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

277
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.440
<v Speaker 1>it seems like no nonsense.</v>

278
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.400
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it seems normal.</v>

279
00:10:33.401 --> 00:10:34.900
<v Speaker 1>It seems like common sense,</v>

280
00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:36.400
<v Speaker 1>it seems like old knowledge,</v>

281
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.680
<v Speaker 1>but yet you're looked at as some sort of a wild man out there.</v>

282
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.143
<v Speaker 3>A lunatic.</v>

283
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.571
<v Speaker 3>You're a lunatic.</v>

284
00:10:44.571 --> 00:10:45.650
<v Speaker 3>You're nice to your animals.</v>

285
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:46.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

286
00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:47.031
<v Speaker 3>we are.</v>

287
00:10:47.031 --> 00:10:47.301
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

288
00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:48.134
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

289
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:48.921
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>

290
00:10:48.921 --> 00:10:49.071
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

291
00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:50.150
<v Speaker 3>you're so clever,</v>

292
00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:50.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

293
00:10:50.421 --> 00:10:51.590
<v Speaker 3>how do you come up with this?</v>

294
00:10:51.591 --> 00:10:53.900
<v Speaker 3>And My response is that,</v>

295
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:55.363
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

296
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.720
<v Speaker 3>this is not new,</v>

297
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:57.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

298
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

299
00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:58.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean it takes,</v>

300
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:59.990
<v Speaker 3>like take just for example,</v>

301
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:02.540
<v Speaker 3>our culture,</v>

302
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:02.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

303
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:03.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean our,</v>

304
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.981
<v Speaker 3>our experts,</v>

305
00:11:03.981 --> 00:11:04.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

306
00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:07.880
<v Speaker 3>our Usda and are a usda,</v>

307
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.050
<v Speaker 3>our expert tea.</v>

308
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:09.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

309
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

310
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:10.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

311
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.100
<v Speaker 3>they don't think that animals are supposed to move.</v>

312
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.053
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

313
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.450
<v Speaker 3>but animals are supposed to move.</v>

314
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.403
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's like,</v>

315
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:19.970
<v Speaker 3>that's like a fundamental,</v>

316
00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:20.930
<v Speaker 3>natural pattern.</v>

317
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.820
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>

318
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.990
<v Speaker 3>if you pause it,</v>

319
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.470
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

320
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.500
<v Speaker 3>animals were supposed to move will then a whole series of things happen,</v>

321
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

322
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.833
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

323
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

324
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.460
<v Speaker 3>control mechanisms,</v>

325
00:11:31.461 --> 00:11:32.330
<v Speaker 3>shelter,</v>

326
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:32.841
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

327
00:11:32.841 --> 00:11:33.980
<v Speaker 3>water delivery systems,</v>

328
00:11:33.981 --> 00:11:35.510
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of things happen to happen.</v>

329
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.120
<v Speaker 3>If you just pause it,</v>

330
00:11:37.121 --> 00:11:37.970
<v Speaker 3>something as,</v>

331
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.780
<v Speaker 3>as intuitively simple as on our farm,</v>

332
00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:42.860
<v Speaker 3>animals are going to move.</v>

333
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.103
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

334
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.160
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

335
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.210
<v Speaker 3>if animals are going to move,</v>

336
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.680
<v Speaker 3>you have to keep them home,</v>

337
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.490
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to move them in the right place at the right time.</v>

338
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 3>So then you have to have portable control mechanisms or you got to keep them</v>

339
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:58.511
<v Speaker 3>comfortable.</v>

340
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:02.670
<v Speaker 3>So then you have portable shade mechanisms and uh,</v>

341
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.120
<v Speaker 3>you got to u of m water,</v>

342
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 3>so we've got to be able to have portable water and um,</v>

343
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.200
<v Speaker 3>and so all these things necessarily flow from just something as basic as animals</v>

344
00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:16.420
<v Speaker 3>move.</v>

345
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.290
<v Speaker 3>Find it fascinating.</v>

346
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 1>It is fascinating because most people have,</v>

347
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.270
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

348
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:24.460
<v Speaker 1>they've gone the opposite way with what they've said is we don't want animals to</v>

349
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:25.060
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>

350
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.110
<v Speaker 1>So let's contain it.</v>

351
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:26.944
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

352
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:27.361
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

353
00:12:27.361 --> 00:12:27.571
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

354
00:12:27.571 --> 00:12:28.060
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>

355
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.660
<v Speaker 3>the industrial system is predicated on,</v>

356
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:31.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

357
00:12:31.171 --> 00:12:31.291
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

358
00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:33.050
<v Speaker 3>we lock all these animals up in a,</v>

359
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.920
<v Speaker 3>in a confinement facility,</v>

360
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.070
<v Speaker 3>a 15,000 chickens in a house,</v>

361
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

362
00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:43.050
<v Speaker 3>non laying hens and a 16 by 22 inch cubicle.</v>

363
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:44.131
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

364
00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:49.131
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's not enough room even to sit down cattle in feedlots,</v>

365
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.200
<v Speaker 3>pigs in confinement houses.</v>

366
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.300
<v Speaker 3>And we'd do the same thing kind of in our plants.</v>

367
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

368
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.380
<v Speaker 3>that's the next thing then is in nature,</v>

369
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.440
<v Speaker 3>there are no monocultures,</v>

370
00:13:01.441 --> 00:13:02.940
<v Speaker 3>there are no monitor species.</v>

371
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Anywhere you go in nature,</v>

372
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.600
<v Speaker 3>no matter where you'd hike,</v>

373
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.820
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be at least two species.</v>

374
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.490
<v Speaker 3>You're going to encounter multiple things.</v>

375
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.353
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

376
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.800
<v Speaker 3>you're going to counter animals and plants in proximity.</v>

377
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.790
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

378
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.630
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be fields of animal lists,</v>

379
00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.960
<v Speaker 3>wheat or fields of animalistic strawberries.</v>

380
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.540
<v Speaker 3>And then over here the animals can find in a,</v>

381
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:28.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

382
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.110
<v Speaker 3>a little itty bitty building,</v>

383
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.770
<v Speaker 3>stinking up the neighborhood instead in nature.</v>

384
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.550
<v Speaker 3>These things are actually proximate and they're actually symbiotic.</v>

385
00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:39.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

386
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.570
<v Speaker 3>they actually have a lot of synergistic functions to each other.</v>

387
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:47.130
<v Speaker 1>I found it fascinating that you w when you raise your pigs,</v>

388
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.020
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

389
00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.580
<v Speaker 1>you call them a wood finish,</v>

390
00:13:50.581 --> 00:13:51.570
<v Speaker 1>forest finished.</v>

391
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.043
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

392
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.670
<v Speaker 3>We call them a,</v>

393
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:55.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

394
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.350
<v Speaker 3>a pasture finished or,</v>

395
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.221
<v Speaker 3>or acorn.</v>

396
00:13:58.221 --> 00:13:59.570
<v Speaker 3>Glen's a,</v>

397
00:13:59.571 --> 00:14:00.800
<v Speaker 3>we call them Glen's,</v>

398
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:01.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

399
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.350
<v Speaker 3>for the old leprechauns,</v>

400
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

401
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.660
<v Speaker 3>lurking in the plan and the forest just has a nice ring to it.</v>

402
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.183
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

403
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.461
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

404
00:14:10.461 --> 00:14:10.621
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

405
00:14:10.621 --> 00:14:10.970
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

406
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.200
<v Speaker 3>we use electric fence.</v>

407
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.660
<v Speaker 3>This is not,</v>

408
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

409
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.550
<v Speaker 3>a luddite.</v>

410
00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.220
<v Speaker 3>This is not anti technology stuff.</v>

411
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.940
<v Speaker 3>What we're doing is using pigs.</v>

412
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.820
<v Speaker 3>All pigs have four wheel drive and uh,</v>

413
00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:26.601
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

414
00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:27.434
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

415
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.420
<v Speaker 3>they like to disturb places.</v>

416
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.081
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

417
00:14:30.081 --> 00:14:30.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

418
00:14:30.261 --> 00:14:35.261
<v Speaker 3>they have a great big bow on the end of their face called the nose and so all</v>

419
00:14:37.431 --> 00:14:42.431
<v Speaker 3>we're doing is taking the way buffalo and fire and predators used to move across</v>

420
00:14:44.121 --> 00:14:45.480
<v Speaker 3>the landscape with this,</v>

421
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:45.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

422
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.390
<v Speaker 3>with periodic disturbance.</v>

423
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.670
<v Speaker 3>We don't have buffalo anymore,</v>

424
00:14:49.671 --> 00:14:50.780
<v Speaker 3>we don't have the fire,</v>

425
00:14:50.781 --> 00:14:52.430
<v Speaker 3>we don't have the wolves much.</v>

426
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.000
<v Speaker 3>And so how do we create this disturbance,</v>

427
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

428
00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.093
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>

429
00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 3>this is a very important ecological principle that,</v>

430
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.533
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

431
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.080
<v Speaker 3>that living organisms have to be disturbed in order to have succession to</v>

432
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:09.974
<v Speaker 3>another level.</v>

433
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.121
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

434
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:16.121
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the pain that comes from a exercise and if you want to,</v>

435
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.640
<v Speaker 3>if you want to be physically fit,</v>

436
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.250
<v Speaker 3>you got to disturb your body,</v>

437
00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:23.450
<v Speaker 3>you got to get up off the couch.</v>

438
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 3>Potato and ecology is the same way.</v>

439
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.080
<v Speaker 3>It needs to be disturbed.</v>

440
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.273
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

441
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:28.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

442
00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:33.530
<v Speaker 3>actually the ecology is used to having a lot of disturbance factors on it,</v>

443
00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:35.330
<v Speaker 3>disturbance and then rest disturbance.</v>

444
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:36.164
<v Speaker 3>And then rest,</v>

445
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:41.470
<v Speaker 3>and so we use high tech electric fencing to be able to move these pigs around in</v>

446
00:15:41.721 --> 00:15:42.291
<v Speaker 3>these forests.</v>

447
00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:45.780
<v Speaker 3>Glen's from one little section to another in a,</v>

448
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.430
<v Speaker 3>in a kind of rapid rotation so that we have very,</v>

449
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

450
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:55.030
<v Speaker 3>intense disturbance and then a long period of rest in intense disturbance and</v>

451
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:56.150
<v Speaker 3>long fraser.</v>

452
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.000
<v Speaker 3>And what that does is the pigs then go in and they,</v>

453
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.240
<v Speaker 3>they till they eat bugs that would affect the trees.</v>

454
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.270
<v Speaker 3>They route out starchy weedy species,</v>

455
00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:06.104
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

456
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:07.543
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

457
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 3>eat a lot,</v>

458
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.850
<v Speaker 3>eat a lot of goodies to get fresh air.</v>

459
00:16:10.851 --> 00:16:11.720
<v Speaker 3>They get exercise,</v>

460
00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:16.721
<v Speaker 3>sunshine and a and are able to fully express their pigness and uh,</v>

461
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:18.230
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

462
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:23.230
<v Speaker 3>and what you end up within is an incredibly nutrient dense product as opposed to</v>

463
00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:26.301
<v Speaker 3>a white meat,</v>

464
00:16:26.301 --> 00:16:28.550
<v Speaker 3>flabby product like out of the industry.</v>

465
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.970
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing is that you now have a whole new bunch of species that have</v>

466
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:40.901
<v Speaker 3>germinated and sprouted in this disturbed a environment is disturbed soil.</v>

467
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:42.740
<v Speaker 3>And you actually,</v>

468
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.930
<v Speaker 3>you actually capture more solar energy than you would with just leaves and</v>

469
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.910
<v Speaker 3>sterile forest bottom.</v>

470
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.741
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

471
00:16:50.741 --> 00:16:51.840
<v Speaker 3>the actual product,</v>

472
00:16:51.841 --> 00:16:54.320
<v Speaker 3>that pig itself would be more like a wild pig then?</v>

473
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

474
00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:55.850
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly right.</v>

475
00:16:55.851 --> 00:16:56.301
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

476
00:16:56.301 --> 00:16:57.020
<v Speaker 3>we've had a,</v>

477
00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.160
<v Speaker 3>we supply about 50 restaurants and um,</v>

478
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:05.380
<v Speaker 3>we've had chefs do displacement tests where they'll get like industry p,</v>

479
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.141
<v Speaker 3>industry,</v>

480
00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 3>pork,</v>

481
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.670
<v Speaker 3>and our pork,</v>

482
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:12.380
<v Speaker 3>and using their very carefully calibrated scales they can make,</v>

483
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:12.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

484
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.940
<v Speaker 3>two blocks of meat that are exactly the same weight,</v>

485
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:19.460
<v Speaker 3>put them in a pan of water,</v>

486
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:24.461
<v Speaker 3>measure the displacement and our pork displaces less water per pound than the</v>

487
00:17:27.831 --> 00:17:28.790
<v Speaker 3>industrial park.</v>

488
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:29.683
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

489
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:29.961
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

490
00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:33.770
<v Speaker 3>what it means is that the tissue is stronger.</v>

491
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.233
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

492
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.780
<v Speaker 3>there is,</v>

493
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.930
<v Speaker 3>there is more weight per cubic inch,</v>

494
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:40.970
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

495
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.730
<v Speaker 3>which means it's,</v>

496
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.190
<v Speaker 3>it's better formed.</v>

497
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:46.160
<v Speaker 3>It's why would we call that?</v>

498
00:17:46.161 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 3>We call that muscle tone.</v>

499
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.231
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

500
00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:48.531
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>

501
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:48.771
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

502
00:17:48.771 --> 00:17:50.480
<v Speaker 3>So they're denser fat,</v>

503
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.343
<v Speaker 3>fat,</v>

504
00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.090
<v Speaker 3>and Flab.</v>

505
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.010
<v Speaker 3>We can say Flab,</v>

506
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.023
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

507
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.540
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

508
00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.080
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

509
00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.780
<v Speaker 3>is a lot more volume per pound.</v>

510
00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.720
<v Speaker 3>If you jump into a swimming pool and you're really muscled,</v>

511
00:18:04.721 --> 00:18:05.450
<v Speaker 3>toned,</v>

512
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:06.920
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you have trouble floating.</v>

513
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 3>But if you're a,</v>

514
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:09.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

515
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.640
<v Speaker 3>a fat person,</v>

516
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:11.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

517
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:14.120
<v Speaker 3>you can float in atwater water like a blimp all day,</v>

518
00:18:14.121 --> 00:18:14.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

519
00:18:14.331 --> 00:18:15.380
<v Speaker 3>it just works fine.</v>

520
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.573
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

521
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:17.300
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

522
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:17.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

523
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.040
<v Speaker 3>a density,</v>

524
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:24.100
<v Speaker 3>muscle tone and density can be measured with a displacement tests.</v>

525
00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:25.600
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>

526
00:18:25.601 --> 00:18:28.900
<v Speaker 4>So I'm this much more nutrient dense.</v>

527
00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:29.630
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

528
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.811
<v Speaker 4>Is,</v>

529
00:18:29.811 --> 00:18:30.070
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

530
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.750
<v Speaker 4>is it preferred by these chefs?</v>

531
00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:32.643
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

532
00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:34.511
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

533
00:18:34.511 --> 00:18:35.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's why.</v>

534
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:36.550
<v Speaker 4>That's why they get it.</v>

535
00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.440
<v Speaker 4>And the end result is that you actually get,</v>

536
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:45.220
<v Speaker 4>you actually get more nutrition per pound because it's,</v>

537
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:45.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

538
00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.383
<v Speaker 4>it's denser.</v>

539
00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:51.930
<v Speaker 4>I smoked a wild hand for the first time this past week and it was a fascinating</v>

540
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.990
<v Speaker 4>how much different it tasted than a regular ham.</v>

541
00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.340
<v Speaker 4>So your,</v>

542
00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.250
<v Speaker 4>your Hams would be similar to that,</v>

543
00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:00.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

544
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:01.503
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

545
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.281
<v Speaker 3>Darker,</v>

546
00:19:02.281 --> 00:19:02.580
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

547
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:02.950
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

548
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

549
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.680
<v Speaker 3>when the industry says pork,</v>

550
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:04.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

551
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:06.300
<v Speaker 3>remember they had the campaign for what,</v>

552
00:19:06.301 --> 00:19:06.990
<v Speaker 3>10 years,</v>

553
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.231
<v Speaker 3>pork,</v>

554
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:08.130
<v Speaker 3>the other white meat.</v>

555
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.080
<v Speaker 3>I think now it's um,</v>

556
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 3>what's the new that they abandoned that slogan,</v>

557
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:13.974
<v Speaker 3>now it's a,</v>

558
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

559
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.470
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>

560
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

561
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.430
<v Speaker 3>get with it or something like that.</v>

562
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:18.923
<v Speaker 3>Be inspired,</v>

563
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.590
<v Speaker 3>be inspired by it.</v>

564
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:21.271
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what,</v>

565
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:23.220
<v Speaker 3>being an animal that lives in a box.</v>

566
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.800
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

567
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:24.340
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

568
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

569
00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.180
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

570
00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:25.630
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

571
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.811
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

572
00:19:25.811 --> 00:19:26.370
<v Speaker 3>disease that.</v>

573
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:26.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

574
00:19:26.551 --> 00:19:27.510
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

575
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:27.750
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

576
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.710
<v Speaker 3>my father in law,</v>

577
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.830
<v Speaker 3>he's in his eighties now and you know,</v>

578
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.650
<v Speaker 3>they used to raise hogs on their farm and it's interesting they built there.</v>

579
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:39.651
<v Speaker 3>They had a kind of a shed shelter where the pigs would go in and eat like sour</v>

580
00:19:40.101 --> 00:19:44.850
<v Speaker 3>milk and whey and leftovers from the milk about 20 cows.</v>

581
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.290
<v Speaker 3>And so they'd always be leftovers.</v>

582
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.000
<v Speaker 3>And the pigs go in there.</v>

583
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:53.060
<v Speaker 3>Well they actually built it with the sil two feet above the ground so the pigs</v>

584
00:19:53.221 --> 00:19:58.221
<v Speaker 3>had to jump up in there and that exercise made their hams taste way better and</v>

585
00:19:58.531 --> 00:19:58.690
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

586
00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.770
<v Speaker 3>and it increased oxygen flow to their hands.</v>

587
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.490
<v Speaker 3>So the meat was rose colored rather than white.</v>

588
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

589
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.050
<v Speaker 3>and that rose color indicates iron,</v>

590
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:11.010
<v Speaker 3>hemoglobin,</v>

591
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.873
<v Speaker 3>iron.</v>

592
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.713
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

593
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.250
<v Speaker 3>the exercise of jumping in and the extra eye.</v>

594
00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.170
<v Speaker 3>I collect old ag books.</v>

595
00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Anything before 19 fifties,</v>

596
00:20:21.091 --> 00:20:21.924
<v Speaker 3>pretty good.</v>

597
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.970
<v Speaker 3>After that it all went to pot.</v>

598
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:25.403
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

599
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.310
<v Speaker 3>and so if you read any like old 19,</v>

600
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.061
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>

601
00:20:30.061 --> 00:20:30.541
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>

602
00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:31.080
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

603
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.510
<v Speaker 3>1900 a swine book,</v>

604
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.870
<v Speaker 3>the first thing it'll say is exercise exercise because the pork responds to that</v>

605
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.430
<v Speaker 3>oxygenation of the blood and makes the meat a deep,</v>

606
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.100
<v Speaker 3>a deep rich color,</v>

607
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.943
<v Speaker 3>which indicates,</v>

608
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

609
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.173
<v Speaker 3>iron</v>

610
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:50.570
<v Speaker 4>that is so fascinating.</v>

611
00:20:50.571 --> 00:20:52.340
<v Speaker 4>So this white meat is pork,</v>

612
00:20:52.341 --> 00:20:52.761
<v Speaker 4>the other white.</v>

613
00:20:52.761 --> 00:20:54.650
<v Speaker 4>What a crazy ad campaign that is.</v>

614
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.020
<v Speaker 4>Of course it is based entirely on,</v>

615
00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

616
00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.220
<v Speaker 4>on ignorance.</v>

617
00:20:58.530 --> 00:20:59.363
<v Speaker 3>Sure it is.</v>

618
00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.650
<v Speaker 3>Yes it is.</v>

619
00:21:01.651 --> 00:21:01.891
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

620
00:21:01.891 --> 00:21:02.671
<v Speaker 3>the same thing as,</v>

621
00:21:02.671 --> 00:21:02.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

622
00:21:02.851 --> 00:21:04.620
<v Speaker 3>our chickens are vegetarians.</v>

623
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.970
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

624
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Birds are omnivores.</v>

625
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:07.680
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

626
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean whoever saw robin refuse a worm,</v>

627
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:11.251
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

628
00:21:11.251 --> 00:21:13.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean birds are omnivores.</v>

629
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.610
<v Speaker 3>So this whole idea of,</v>

630
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.550
<v Speaker 3>of a vegetarian fed chickens is just,</v>

631
00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.110
<v Speaker 3>doesn't be sick chickens.</v>

632
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:19.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

633
00:21:19.471 --> 00:21:19.850
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

634
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:20.160
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

635
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:20.890
<v Speaker 3>it makes you know,</v>

636
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.190
<v Speaker 3>Pale nutrition,</v>

637
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.390
<v Speaker 3>nutrient deficient egg.</v>

638
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:25.091
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

639
00:21:25.091 --> 00:21:27.220
<v Speaker 4>There's a big difference in the color of the eggs.</v>

640
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.510
<v Speaker 4>I have chickens,</v>

641
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.720
<v Speaker 4>I have 13 chickens in my yard and my wife and I have been doing that for the</v>

642
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.093
<v Speaker 4>past year and a half now.</v>

643
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.890
<v Speaker 4>And it's amazing how much better the eggs taste.</v>

644
00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:41.290
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing how much darker the Yolk is,</v>

645
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.250
<v Speaker 4>it's like a dark orange and uh,</v>

646
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:44.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

647
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.550
<v Speaker 4>we have a big yard and we keep them and we have a huge house built that's bigger</v>

648
00:21:48.551 --> 00:21:49.301
<v Speaker 4>than the studio,</v>

649
00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:50.410
<v Speaker 4>bigger than this room at least,</v>

650
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.740
<v Speaker 4>and the chickens all live in there and they have plenty of room to run around.</v>

651
00:21:53.741 --> 00:21:55.540
<v Speaker 4>And then Taj Mahal chicken house,</v>

652
00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:59.680
<v Speaker 4>it's a big chicken house and then we opened the door and let them roam around</v>

653
00:21:59.681 --> 00:22:03.760
<v Speaker 4>the yard and pick up bugs and worms and all that stuff.</v>

654
00:22:03.761 --> 00:22:06.010
<v Speaker 4>But they're chicken this expressed.</v>

655
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.903
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way to.</v>

656
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.790
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way to put it in our,</v>

657
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.800
<v Speaker 3>in our country right now,</v>

658
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.750
<v Speaker 3>in the industrial foods,</v>

659
00:22:13.751 --> 00:22:14.501
<v Speaker 3>I call it the,</v>

660
00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:14.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

661
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:19.480
<v Speaker 3>the industrial corporate USDA fraternity,</v>

662
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.940
<v Speaker 3>they don't view life as fundamentally biological.</v>

663
00:22:24.941 --> 00:22:27.820
<v Speaker 3>They view life as fundamentally mechanical.</v>

664
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.890
<v Speaker 3>That's the big difference between the industrial food perspective and what I'll</v>

665
00:22:32.891 --> 00:22:33.770
<v Speaker 3>call a,</v>

666
00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:34.500
<v Speaker 3>a more,</v>

667
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

668
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.330
<v Speaker 3>a craft oriented food perspective.</v>

669
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.493
<v Speaker 3>Is,</v>

670
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:43.530
<v Speaker 3>is food fundamentally biological or is it mechanical and they don't ask.</v>

671
00:22:43.811 --> 00:22:44.021
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

672
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:47.650
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a research project that starts with an umbrella,</v>

673
00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.090
<v Speaker 3>a supposition.</v>

674
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.203
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

675
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.220
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

676
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.160
<v Speaker 3>let's define what makes a happy chicken or a happy pig,</v>

677
00:22:54.161 --> 00:22:54.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

678
00:22:54.401 --> 00:22:56.620
<v Speaker 3>it's all about how do we grow them faster,</v>

679
00:22:56.621 --> 00:22:57.281
<v Speaker 3>fat or bigger,</v>

680
00:22:57.281 --> 00:22:58.114
<v Speaker 3>cheaper,</v>

681
00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.073
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

682
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:04.180
<v Speaker 3>as if they're just inanimate piles of protoplasm ics structure to be</v>

683
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.291
<v Speaker 3>manipulated.</v>

684
00:23:05.291 --> 00:23:05.681
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

685
00:23:05.681 --> 00:23:07.960
<v Speaker 3>cleverly Hubris can imagine to manipulate them.</v>

686
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:11.770
<v Speaker 3>And I would suggest that a culture that views it's food,</v>

687
00:23:11.771 --> 00:23:14.260
<v Speaker 3>it's plant and an animals from,</v>

688
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.540
<v Speaker 3>from that kind of mechanistic,</v>

689
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.310
<v Speaker 3>manipulative standpoint,</v>

690
00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:23.020
<v Speaker 3>we'll view its people the same way that other cultures the same way.</v>

691
00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.140
<v Speaker 4>That's a very good point.</v>

692
00:23:24.141 --> 00:23:24.771
<v Speaker 4>Both points.</v>

693
00:23:24.771 --> 00:23:24.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

694
00:23:24.951 --> 00:23:25.790
<v Speaker 4>Is a very good point.</v>

695
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.520
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that your,</v>

696
00:23:27.521 --> 00:23:27.970
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

697
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.970
<v Speaker 4>your style of farming is,</v>

698
00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.150
<v Speaker 4>is that possible on a large scale?</v>

699
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Speaker 3>That's my favorite question.</v>

700
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

701
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:39.670
<v Speaker 3>know can we feed the world because ultimately all of this is just a bunch of,</v>

702
00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:40.810
<v Speaker 3>is an exercise in,</v>

703
00:23:40.811 --> 00:23:41.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

704
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:41.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

705
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:42.600
<v Speaker 3>feel goodness,</v>

706
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:42.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

707
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 3>warm fuzziness unless it actually does translate to feeding the world.</v>

708
00:23:46.251 --> 00:23:46.571
<v Speaker 3>So let,</v>

709
00:23:46.571 --> 00:23:46.750
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

710
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:47.000
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

711
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.520
<v Speaker 3>let's take that and interrupt me anytime.</v>

712
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm first of all,</v>

713
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.080
<v Speaker 3>for the first time in human history,</v>

714
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:59.081
<v Speaker 3>we're producing twice as much human edible food as we need on the planet twice a</v>

715
00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 3>manage half of all human edible food never gets eaten by a human.</v>

716
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.620
<v Speaker 3>That's the first time that's ever happened,</v>

717
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.700
<v Speaker 3>which means,</v>

718
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.330
<v Speaker 3>which means that if,</v>

719
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:09.981
<v Speaker 3>if you were,</v>

720
00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:14.981
<v Speaker 3>I could click our fingers today and suddenly double the earth's food production,</v>

721
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:17.900
<v Speaker 3>not a single other person would get a meal.</v>

722
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Food people go hungry.</v>

723
00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Not because there's not enough food,</v>

724
00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:28.160
<v Speaker 3>but because of demographic problems,</v>

725
00:24:28.161 --> 00:24:29.270
<v Speaker 3>infrastructure problems,</v>

726
00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:29.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

727
00:24:29.421 --> 00:24:30.440
<v Speaker 3>there's not a road,</v>

728
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:31.603
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

729
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:32.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

730
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.751
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

731
00:24:32.751 --> 00:24:33.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

732
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.630
<v Speaker 3>cultural issues like in inner cities and,</v>

733
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:36.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

734
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.510
<v Speaker 3>that had been taken over by drugs,</v>

735
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:39.560
<v Speaker 3>may have an and,</v>

736
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.360
<v Speaker 3>and gangs,</v>

737
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

738
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.220
<v Speaker 3>businesses don't want to go there.</v>

739
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

740
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.470
<v Speaker 3>people with integrity,</v>

741
00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:46.520
<v Speaker 3>food don't want to go there.</v>

742
00:24:46.521 --> 00:24:47.300
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

743
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.470
<v Speaker 3>and so there's a,</v>

744
00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:49.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

745
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.320
<v Speaker 3>there's a tremendous amount of waste.</v>

746
00:24:51.321 --> 00:24:51.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

747
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.120
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a guy that just was at a green bean factory in Zimbabwe.</v>

748
00:24:56.121 --> 00:24:59.900
<v Speaker 3>They were exporting to Europe and they were taken in five tons a day and only</v>

749
00:24:59.901 --> 00:25:00.800
<v Speaker 3>shipping to tons.</v>

750
00:25:00.801 --> 00:25:01.041
<v Speaker 3>I says,</v>

751
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:02.310
<v Speaker 3>what happened to us in three tons?</v>

752
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.261
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

753
00:25:03.261 --> 00:25:04.011
<v Speaker 3>they're crooked,</v>

754
00:25:04.011 --> 00:25:04.701
<v Speaker 3>they're too long,</v>

755
00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:05.480
<v Speaker 3>they're too short,</v>

756
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.960
<v Speaker 3>they've got a little black spot that you know.</v>

757
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:08.893
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

758
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:09.690
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

759
00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:09.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

760
00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:10.683
<v Speaker 3>so we're,</v>

761
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:11.430
<v Speaker 3>we're waste,</v>

762
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.440
<v Speaker 3>we're wasting a lot of food.</v>

763
00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:14.503
<v Speaker 3>Secondly,</v>

764
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.440
<v Speaker 3>there is a tremendous amount of land that's not being used because we have a</v>

765
00:25:20.451 --> 00:25:23.090
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally segregated food system,</v>

766
00:25:23.091 --> 00:25:24.680
<v Speaker 3>not an integrated food system.</v>

767
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:26.511
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

768
00:25:26.511 --> 00:25:26.781
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:25:26.781 --> 00:25:28.760
<v Speaker 3>we produce the food over here,</v>

770
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.163
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>

771
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.550
<v Speaker 3>and we eat it over here.</v>

772
00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:32.390
<v Speaker 3>We feed it over here.</v>

773
00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:33.650
<v Speaker 3>We have the manure over here,</v>

774
00:25:33.651 --> 00:25:34.484
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

775
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:35.140
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

776
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 3>the old integrated system is no longer,</v>

777
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.990
<v Speaker 3>there are $35,</v>

778
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
<v Speaker 3>million acres of lawn in the US and $36 million acres housing and feeding</v>

779
00:25:46.251 --> 00:25:47.420
<v Speaker 3>recreational horses.</v>

780
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.340
<v Speaker 3>That 71 million acres,</v>

781
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.090
<v Speaker 3>that's enough to feed the entire us without a single farmer ranch.</v>

782
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

783
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.550
<v Speaker 1>So what this food that's going bad.</v>

784
00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.180
<v Speaker 1>So if we're making twice as much food as people need,</v>

785
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.190
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

786
00:26:03.191 --> 00:26:07.750
<v Speaker 1>A matter of the food deteriorating too quickly to get to people or it's never</v>

787
00:26:07.751 --> 00:26:08.584
<v Speaker 1>going to get to people.</v>

788
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.250
<v Speaker 3>It's never going to get to people,</v>

789
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:10.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

790
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:11.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

791
00:26:11.211 --> 00:26:11.510
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

792
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:16.510
<v Speaker 3>go by the back door of any supermarket produce department and you will see,</v>

793
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

794
00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:22.220
<v Speaker 3>dumpsters full of spoil stuff at one of the reasons.</v>

795
00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:22.791
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

796
00:26:22.791 --> 00:26:23.750
<v Speaker 3>there are numerous reasons.</v>

797
00:26:23.751 --> 00:26:24.530
<v Speaker 3>There are,</v>

798
00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.180
<v Speaker 3>there are residue problems,</v>

799
00:26:26.181 --> 00:26:27.020
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

800
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:27.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

801
00:26:27.561 --> 00:26:28.394
<v Speaker 3>a dairy that,</v>

802
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.430
<v Speaker 3>that accidentally dumped some antibiotic for example.</v>

803
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:35.510
<v Speaker 3>And then it takes a whole tractor trailer load of milk that's common,</v>

804
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.673
<v Speaker 3>that's common.</v>

805
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:37.993
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

806
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.880
<v Speaker 3>you have a cosmetic issues,</v>

807
00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:42.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

808
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:46.000
<v Speaker 3>a piece of fruit that has one little blemish throwaway,</v>

809
00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:47.403
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

810
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

811
00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.293
<v Speaker 3>the long,</v>

812
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.960
<v Speaker 3>the long warehousing and chain of custody,</v>

813
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:52.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

814
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.131
<v Speaker 3>between,</v>

815
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:53.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

816
00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.210
<v Speaker 3>between field and fork that create spoilage issues.</v>

817
00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.010
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

818
00:26:59.011 --> 00:26:59.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

819
00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:03.570
<v Speaker 3>there are just a lot of factors in the system that don't do it,</v>

820
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:04.110
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

821
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.490
<v Speaker 3>that spoiled food.</v>

822
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.350
<v Speaker 3>That being said,</v>

823
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:08.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

824
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:09.060
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

825
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.610
<v Speaker 3>we can absolutely grow a lot more food than we do.</v>

826
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

827
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:13.770
<v Speaker 3>people are enamored,</v>

828
00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:13.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

829
00:27:13.921 --> 00:27:18.720
<v Speaker 3>they see six combines running side by side down through a Kansas wheat field and</v>

830
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:19.201
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

831
00:27:19.201 --> 00:27:19.651
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

832
00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:20.161
<v Speaker 3>look at that,</v>

833
00:27:20.161 --> 00:27:20.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

834
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:21.720
<v Speaker 3>or they see a great big,</v>

835
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.381
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

836
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:26.790
<v Speaker 3>a 500 acre fumigated strawberry field in California,</v>

837
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:27.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

838
00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:27.511
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

839
00:27:27.511 --> 00:27:28.410
<v Speaker 3>look at all that production.</v>

840
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.800
<v Speaker 3>But the fact is that even a very rudimentary,</v>

841
00:27:34.291 --> 00:27:39.291
<v Speaker 3>almost poorly done backyard garden is more productive per square yard than the</v>

842
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:43.800
<v Speaker 3>most industrial sophisticated,</v>

843
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:47.250
<v Speaker 3>technologically advanced Monto speciated industrial farm.</v>

844
00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:48.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the truth.</v>

845
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:49.223
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

846
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.900
<v Speaker 3>Why is that is because there is a,</v>

847
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.501
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

848
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:53.580
<v Speaker 3>when you diversify,</v>

849
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.010
<v Speaker 3>when you have a diversified,</v>

850
00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.910
<v Speaker 3>a cornucopia of plants and animals in proximity,</v>

851
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:05.600
<v Speaker 3>you actually have a synergistic effect so that instead of growing one species,</v>

852
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:13.820
<v Speaker 3>if you reduce the production of one species and grow to species on the same</v>

853
00:28:15.121 --> 00:28:15.954
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>

854
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:17.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

855
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.520
<v Speaker 3>you get like 120 percent of your production.</v>

856
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.900
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

857
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:22.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

858
00:28:22.351 --> 00:28:22.580
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

859
00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.140
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

860
00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:23.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

861
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.660
<v Speaker 3>we have pastured livestock,</v>

862
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:27.030
<v Speaker 3>so we run the cows across the pasture.</v>

863
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.040
<v Speaker 3>We run the egg mobiles behind them,</v>

864
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:29.821
<v Speaker 3>the egg mobiles,</v>

865
00:28:29.821 --> 00:28:34.710
<v Speaker 3>or have chickens that scratch to the cow patties and eat the eat now the newly</v>

866
00:28:34.711 --> 00:28:37.380
<v Speaker 3>exposed grasshoppers and crickets that the,</v>

867
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

868
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:39.930
<v Speaker 3>that the cows exposed by eating the grass.</v>

869
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.750
<v Speaker 3>And then we run broiler chickens,</v>

870
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.390
<v Speaker 3>meat chickens over that same ground.</v>

871
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:47.490
<v Speaker 3>We run turkeys over that same ground.</v>

872
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.520
<v Speaker 3>And so all of those animals,</v>

873
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.160
<v Speaker 3>they're not on the same square foot at the same time,</v>

874
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.260
<v Speaker 3>but they go like,</v>

875
00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:56.481
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

876
00:28:56.481 --> 00:28:56.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

877
00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:57.060
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

878
00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:57.421
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

879
00:28:57.421 --> 00:28:57.751
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

880
00:28:57.751 --> 00:28:58.584
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

881
00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.020
<v Speaker 3>different waves of,</v>

882
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.840
<v Speaker 3>of production across the landscape.</v>

883
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:09.350
<v Speaker 3>And so whereas the normal farm would have only one of those species confined in</v>

884
00:29:09.361 --> 00:29:10.710
<v Speaker 3>a little tiny building.</v>

885
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:16.460
<v Speaker 3>We have an acre being used all throughout the year with a lot of different kinds</v>

886
00:29:19.231 --> 00:29:20.700
<v Speaker 3>of species going across.</v>

887
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly you don't have pathogens if suddenly you don't have the pathogens</v>

888
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.980
<v Speaker 3>because of the pathogens are confused because you know,</v>

889
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.520
<v Speaker 3>the cow,</v>

890
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.460
<v Speaker 3>the cow pathogen hatches out next to a chicken pathogen and,</v>

891
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:34.280
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>

892
00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.800
<v Speaker 3>and they're toxic to each other.</v>

893
00:29:35.801 --> 00:29:36.634
<v Speaker 3>And so they,</v>

894
00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.620
<v Speaker 3>they have a war in a fight and a die the cancel each other out.</v>

895
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Which is really what's supposed</v>

896
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.023
<v Speaker 4>to happen in nature.</v>

897
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:43.720
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

898
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.553
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

899
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.430
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>

900
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.640
<v Speaker 3>the kind of diversity you see on the Serengeti in Africa at a,</v>

901
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.170
<v Speaker 3>at a waterhole,</v>

902
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:52.560
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

903
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.393
<v Speaker 3>in</v>

904
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.211
<v Speaker 3>Zimbabwe,</v>

905
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:55.691
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

906
00:29:55.691 --> 00:29:57.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean those kinds of diversities.</v>

907
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.991
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

908
00:29:58.991 --> 00:30:01.360
<v Speaker 3>they protect the animals from path,</v>

909
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.590
<v Speaker 3>from their own pathogens because almost all pathogens are species specific.</v>

910
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:09.760
<v Speaker 3>So if you put multiple diversity together,</v>

911
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:10.810
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

912
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:12.140
<v Speaker 3>it acts as a,</v>

913
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:12.993
<v Speaker 3>as a dead end.</v>

914
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:13.983
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

915
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.040
<v Speaker 3>But secondly,</v>

916
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.980
<v Speaker 3>those animals occupy different spaces.</v>

917
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:18.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

918
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.510
<v Speaker 3>you've got,</v>

919
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.310
<v Speaker 3>you've got herbivores,</v>

920
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.840
<v Speaker 3>omnivores carnivores,</v>

921
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:23.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

922
00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.510
<v Speaker 3>there are all occupying the same space.</v>

923
00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:29.530
<v Speaker 3>And so a given area can stack.</v>

924
00:30:29.531 --> 00:30:31.120
<v Speaker 3>That's a permaculture concept.</v>

925
00:30:31.121 --> 00:30:32.560
<v Speaker 3>If you're familiar with permaculture,</v>

926
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:38.400
<v Speaker 3>can stack synergistic multiple species and enterprise on a single land base.</v>

927
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:40.971
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

928
00:30:40.971 --> 00:30:42.890
<v Speaker 4>pull up a polyface farms.</v>

929
00:30:42.891 --> 00:30:43.221
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

930
00:30:43.221 --> 00:30:44.031
<v Speaker 4>there's a video,</v>

931
00:30:44.031 --> 00:30:44.950
<v Speaker 4>fascinating videos,</v>

932
00:30:44.951 --> 00:30:45.500
<v Speaker 4>so you can,</v>

933
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.920
<v Speaker 4>the folks at home can get a sense of what he's talking about when he's saying</v>

934
00:30:48.921 --> 00:30:53.921
<v Speaker 4>egg mobiles and you've designed this sort of chicken house that moves around.</v>

935
00:30:54.621 --> 00:30:54.980
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

936
00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.660
<v Speaker 4>it's on sleds,</v>

937
00:30:56.690 --> 00:31:01.690
<v Speaker 4>it's all wheels and you pull it around and so the chickens will be in one spot</v>

938
00:31:01.911 --> 00:31:06.911
<v Speaker 4>and then you move it to another spot and in doing so you allow the land to get</v>

939
00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.980
<v Speaker 4>moved around.</v>

940
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:11.190
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

941
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Rather than rather than having a stationary structure where we're carrying</v>

942
00:31:15.571 --> 00:31:17.730
<v Speaker 3>everything in and carrying everything out,</v>

943
00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:22.940
<v Speaker 3>and there's a toxicity buildup with the animals being confined to one spot all</v>

944
00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:24.924
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

945
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:30.260
<v Speaker 3>Instead you are actually allowing the animals to move to mimic kind of their</v>

946
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.890
<v Speaker 3>migratory pattern on a domestic scale.</v>

947
00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:37.560
<v Speaker 3>All we're doing is we're cutting out the natural,</v>

948
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.130
<v Speaker 3>the natural template and,</v>

949
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:42.680
<v Speaker 3>and laying it down on a domestic production model.</v>

950
00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:42.871
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>

951
00:31:42.871 --> 00:31:45.390
<v Speaker 3>how can we duplicate this,</v>

952
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:45.900
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

953
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.600
<v Speaker 3>this pattern on a domestic model.</v>

954
00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:48.910
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

955
00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:49.860
<v Speaker 3>that's what we're doing.</v>

956
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.100
<v Speaker 4>And in doing so in like,</v>

957
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.220
<v Speaker 4>this is such a large scale,</v>

958
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:55.463
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

959
00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:00.460
<v Speaker 4>can this be duplicated like the factory farming systems that are so rightly</v>

960
00:32:00.461 --> 00:32:01.660
<v Speaker 4>criticized in this country,</v>

961
00:32:01.661 --> 00:32:03.390
<v Speaker 4>which we find to be a born.</v>

962
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:07.930
<v Speaker 4>When you look at these videos of these chickens living stacked next to each</v>

963
00:32:07.931 --> 00:32:08.231
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>

964
00:32:08.231 --> 00:32:08.351
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

965
00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:09.370
<v Speaker 4>it's horrific stuff.</v>

966
00:32:09.371 --> 00:32:10.204
<v Speaker 4>It is w,</v>

967
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:14.890
<v Speaker 4>what is it that's beneficial about those factory farms that keeps them from</v>

968
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:16.270
<v Speaker 4>doing something like this?</v>

969
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:20.900
<v Speaker 3>What you have to understand is that those factory farms externalize a lot of</v>

970
00:32:20.901 --> 00:32:21.770
<v Speaker 3>their costs.</v>

971
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.551
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

972
00:32:22.551 --> 00:32:27.551
<v Speaker 3>there's collateral damage of that collateral damage in terms of water pollution,</v>

973
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.220
<v Speaker 3>fecal particulate in the air.</v>

974
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:35.660
<v Speaker 3>One of the biggest ones right now is c diff and Murcia,</v>

975
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

976
00:32:36.591 --> 00:32:36.890
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

977
00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:37.221
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

978
00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:37.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

979
00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.840
<v Speaker 3>antibiotic resistant,</v>

980
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:39.550
<v Speaker 3>high,</v>

981
00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:40.031
<v Speaker 3>high,</v>

982
00:32:40.031 --> 00:32:40.864
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

983
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.790
<v Speaker 3>high pass staph infections in hospitals and you know,</v>

984
00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:44.653
<v Speaker 3>that people are getting,</v>

985
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.943
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

986
00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:47.750
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

987
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:48.090
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

988
00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:48.921
<v Speaker 3>and now of course,</v>

989
00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:49.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

990
00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:52.760
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing an exponential growth in autism.</v>

991
00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:54.340
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

992
00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.790
<v Speaker 3>there's a link there to,</v>

993
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:56.290
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

994
00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:57.710
<v Speaker 3>genetically modified organisms.</v>

995
00:32:57.711 --> 00:32:58.940
<v Speaker 3>That might be another discussion,</v>

996
00:32:59.100 --> 00:32:59.300
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

997
00:32:59.300 --> 00:32:59.750
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

998
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:04.750
<v Speaker 3>what I'm getting at is that the collateral damage of the industrial food system,</v>

999
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:07.370
<v Speaker 3>including the nutrient deficiency,</v>

1000
00:33:07.371 --> 00:33:10.640
<v Speaker 3>the fact that the Omega sixes and Omega threes are way out of whack.</v>

1001
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:11.503
<v Speaker 3>So the fats,</v>

1002
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:16.570
<v Speaker 3>instead of reducing cholesterol or instead of being beneficial or are negative.</v>

1003
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:17.993
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1004
00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:18.883
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>

1005
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.980
<v Speaker 3>there are huge nutrient deficiencies.</v>

1006
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:22.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1007
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Riboflavin,</v>

1008
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.710
<v Speaker 3>the eggs in your backyard,</v>

1009
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:28.970
<v Speaker 3>chickens are probably in the area of a thousand micrograms per egg.</v>

1010
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.730
<v Speaker 3>You know what the official us Da,</v>

1011
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1012
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:36.380
<v Speaker 3>nutrient analysis for exit is only 48 micrograms per eggs,</v>

1013
00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:37.680
<v Speaker 3>cheese and,</v>

1014
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.361
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1015
00:33:38.361 --> 00:33:39.194
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

1016
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

1017
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.570
<v Speaker 3>not a folic acid.</v>

1018
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:42.523
<v Speaker 3>Folic acid,</v>

1019
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.000
<v Speaker 3>grass finished beef,</v>

1020
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.580
<v Speaker 3>a 300 percent more riboflavin.</v>

1021
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:51.890
<v Speaker 3>A Riboflavin of course is what helps us to keep calm and not fly off the handle.</v>

1022
00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:52.250
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1023
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.910
<v Speaker 3>it's the nerve.</v>

1024
00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Riboflavin is the nerve one.</v>

1025
00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1026
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:55.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1027
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:58.080
<v Speaker 3>why are people raging and going crazy and you know,</v>

1028
00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.660
<v Speaker 3>shooting people in schools and stuff.</v>

1029
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1030
00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:01.331
<v Speaker 3>because we're,</v>

1031
00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:02.630
<v Speaker 3>we're deficient in Riboflavin.</v>

1032
00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:03.380
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1033
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:03.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1034
00:34:03.711 --> 00:34:03.930
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1035
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:05.290
<v Speaker 3>when people say all yeah,</v>

1036
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.770
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any different food is food,</v>

1037
00:34:06.771 --> 00:34:07.604
<v Speaker 3>is food.</v>

1038
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:08.960
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

1039
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a huge difference in this food.</v>

1040
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:13.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1041
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1042
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.040
<v Speaker 3>vegetables the same way whether they're grown in,</v>

1043
00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:16.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1044
00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:21.540
<v Speaker 3>mineral dense biologically active soil compared to hydroponic or just,</v>

1045
00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:23.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1046
00:34:23.211 --> 00:34:26.360
<v Speaker 3>what we call a ivy soil,</v>

1047
00:34:26.361 --> 00:34:26.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1048
00:34:26.601 --> 00:34:29.330
<v Speaker 3>where the soil is just inert material to hold up a route.</v>

1049
00:34:29.331 --> 00:34:30.000
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>

1050
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.050
<v Speaker 3>we basically ivy chemical fertilizers into that soil to grow up,</v>

1051
00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:34.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1052
00:34:34.311 --> 00:34:35.144
<v Speaker 3>to grow a plant.</v>

1053
00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:35.780
<v Speaker 3>So there are,</v>

1054
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:36.613
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>

1055
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:41.660
<v Speaker 3>there are significant differences in the nutritional element.</v>

1056
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.040
<v Speaker 3>So this is all collateral damage and,</v>

1057
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:44.640
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1058
00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.170
<v Speaker 3>and the slinky effect between cause and effect.</v>

1059
00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:49.170
<v Speaker 3>It takes awhile.</v>

1060
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:49.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1061
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:50.660
<v Speaker 3>take ddt,</v>

1062
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:51.471
<v Speaker 3>DDT,</v>

1063
00:34:51.471 --> 00:34:56.471
<v Speaker 3>it took 14 years from its initial use until 14 years later.</v>

1064
00:34:56.481 --> 00:34:57.800
<v Speaker 3>It was definitively discovered,</v>

1065
00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:58.610
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1066
00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:00.710
<v Speaker 3>that's why we have three legged salamanders,</v>

1067
00:35:00.711 --> 00:35:05.711
<v Speaker 3>infertile frogs and dead zones and eagles' eggs,</v>

1068
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:07.400
<v Speaker 3>eggs won't hatch,</v>

1069
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:07.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1070
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:08.780
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1071
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:09.613
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1072
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.630
<v Speaker 3>cause and effects took a while to materialize because nature is pretty</v>

1073
00:35:14.631 --> 00:35:15.231
<v Speaker 3>resilient,</v>

1074
00:35:15.231 --> 00:35:15.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1075
00:35:15.531 --> 00:35:16.364
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

1076
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:17.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1077
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.460
<v Speaker 3>you can beat yourself up for awhile and you know,</v>

1078
00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.460
<v Speaker 3>still come out kicking for awhile.</v>

1079
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:26.090
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure there's probably also a financial factors that were resisting the</v>

1080
00:35:26.091 --> 00:35:28.320
<v Speaker 3>conclusions will exactly the,</v>

1081
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:29.211
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>

1082
00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Collateral damage is deferred expense,</v>

1083
00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:34.251
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1084
00:35:34.251 --> 00:35:36.020
<v Speaker 3>whether it's obesity,</v>

1085
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.820
<v Speaker 3>health,</v>

1086
00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:37.653
<v Speaker 3>healthcare,</v>

1087
00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:38.683
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1088
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.300
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1089
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:39.841

1091
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:43.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1092
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:44.970
<v Speaker 3>soil loss,</v>

1093

<v Speaker 3>aquifer depletion,</v>

1094
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:48.713
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1095
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.700
<v Speaker 3>desertification,</v>

1096
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.820
<v Speaker 3>these are all differ damages because in our country we don't have an accounting</v>

1097
00:35:57.841 --> 00:35:59.130
<v Speaker 3>system to measure.</v>

1098
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1099
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.970
<v Speaker 3>our only accounting system is,</v>

1100
00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:02.330
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1101
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:02.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1102

<v Speaker 3>cash,</v>

1103
00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:03.451
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1104
00:36:03.451 --> 00:36:05.490
<v Speaker 3>gross domestic product,</v>

1105
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1106
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.780
<v Speaker 3>today's output.</v>

1107
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.120
<v Speaker 3>We don't have a way to measure</v>

1108
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.480
<v Speaker 3>these other elements.</v>

1109
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:12.841
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1110
00:36:12.841 --> 00:36:13.321
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you,</v>

1111
00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:14.370
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you one example.</v>

1112
00:36:14.371 --> 00:36:14.850
<v Speaker 3>Let's take,</v>

1113
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.170
<v Speaker 3>let's take a earthworms.</v>

1114
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Let's agree that earthworms are pretty important.</v>

1115
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:21.893
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1116

1122
00:36:31.051 --> 00:36:32.670
<v Speaker 3>I think this is a good idea.</v>

1123
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.360
<v Speaker 3>We're going to,</v>

1124
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.590
<v Speaker 3>can I be your partner?</v>

1125

<v Speaker 3>We're going to be millionaires,</v>

1126
00:36:36.001 --> 00:36:36.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1127

<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1131
00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:41.970
<v Speaker 3>but before I sign my investment strategy,</v>

1132
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.680
<v Speaker 3>I've got one question for you.</v>

1133
00:36:43.681 --> 00:36:43.891
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1134
00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:44.641
<v Speaker 3>I'm from the south,</v>

1135
00:36:44.641 --> 00:36:44.770
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1136
00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:45.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1137
00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.830
<v Speaker 3>got to have a big hog.</v>

1138
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:47.480
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1141
00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.000
<v Speaker 3>but I gotta ask you one question.</v>

1142
00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:51.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1143
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:55.470
<v Speaker 3>what's this business going to do to the earthworms in our community?</v>

1144
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:57.870
<v Speaker 3>Nobody asks that,</v>

1145
00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:58.131
<v Speaker 3>never.</v>

1146
00:36:58.131 --> 00:36:58.600
<v Speaker 3>Nobody has.</v>

1147
00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:58.950
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1148
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:59.783
<v Speaker 3>and yet,</v>

1149
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:00.923
<v Speaker 3>and yet,</v>

1150
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.040
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally,</v>

1151
00:37:02.041 --> 00:37:03.040
<v Speaker 3>the micro Rhizobia,</v>

1152
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:03.900
<v Speaker 3>the earthworms,</v>

1153
00:37:03.901 --> 00:37:04.320
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1154
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:04.930
<v Speaker 3>the Aza,</v>

1155
00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:05.271
<v Speaker 3>bacteria,</v>

1156
00:37:05.271 --> 00:37:07.200
<v Speaker 3>bacteria that mycelium the hydro,</v>

1157
00:37:07.201 --> 00:37:08.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1158
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1159
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.970
<v Speaker 3>they actually this,</v>

1160
00:37:09.971 --> 00:37:14.971
<v Speaker 3>this invisible community of beings actually supports all of life.</v>

1161
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:18.263
<v Speaker 3>What we see,</v>

1162
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:18.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1163
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:19.170
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

1164
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:22.830
<v Speaker 3>every visible thing that we see is supported by an invisible universe of</v>

1165
00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 3>microscopic bacteria and beings in us around us,</v>

1166
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.050
<v Speaker 3>in the soil,</v>

1167
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:28.883
<v Speaker 3>the cousins,</v>

1168
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.630
<v Speaker 3>and now we know they talk to each other,</v>

1169
00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:36.570
<v Speaker 4>so in a sense what we're getting with factory farming is one small unit in the</v>

1170
00:37:37.511 --> 00:37:38.344
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>

1171
00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:43.350
<v Speaker 4>extracting money at the expense of all these other factors and these extraneous</v>

1172
00:37:44.861 --> 00:37:46.590
<v Speaker 4>costs aren't,</v>

1173
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:47.770
<v Speaker 4>aren't factored in.</v>

1174
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.420
<v Speaker 4>That's because they don't have to be.</v>

1175
00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.170
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to be at our.</v>

1176
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Our system is not set up for accounting.</v>

1177
00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Those other things.</v>

1178
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.080
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>

1179
00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:56.861
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>

1180
00:37:56.861 --> 00:37:57.694
<v Speaker 4>So if,</v>

1181
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:59.650
<v Speaker 4>if it was done correctly,</v>

1182
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.750
<v Speaker 4>it was all done your way,</v>

1183
00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:04.330
<v Speaker 4>although would be more expensive.</v>

1184
00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.610
<v Speaker 4>Those external expenses wouldn't exist in,</v>

1185
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.890
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1186
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:09.720
<v Speaker 3>in the big scheme of things.</v>

1187
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.250
<v Speaker 3>In the big scheme of things,</v>

1188
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.570
<v Speaker 3>the actual,</v>

1189
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:18.440
<v Speaker 3>the actual cost of food would actually be cheaper because you wouldn't have the</v>

1190
00:38:19.621 --> 00:38:20.550
<v Speaker 3>collateral damage.</v>

1191
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:21.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1192
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.010
<v Speaker 3>just take one example.</v>

1193
00:38:23.011 --> 00:38:25.230
<v Speaker 3>In our lifetime mad cow disease.</v>

1194
00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:25.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1195
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:27.630
<v Speaker 3>really for 30 years,</v>

1196
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:33.420
<v Speaker 3>the European and the American expert credential,</v>

1197
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:34.363
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1198
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:39.640
<v Speaker 3>phd academic community took farmers like me to free steak dinners to teach us</v>

1199
00:38:39.641 --> 00:38:42.940
<v Speaker 3>this new scientific method of feeding dead gals to cows.</v>

1200
00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:48.100
<v Speaker 3>And our farm was branded a barbarian,</v>

1201
00:38:48.101 --> 00:38:48.934
<v Speaker 3>Luddite,</v>

1202
00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 3>anti progressive,</v>

1203
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:51.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1204
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.980
<v Speaker 3>science haters because we didn't buy into that,</v>

1205
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1206
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:55.983
<v Speaker 3>that model.</v>

1207
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.210
<v Speaker 3>The reason we didn't buy into it,</v>

1208
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.720
<v Speaker 3>not because we were anti science or anti innovation or anything like that</v>

1209
00:39:01.721 --> 00:39:03.610
<v Speaker 3>because I looked around the earth and,</v>

1210
00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:04.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1211
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:07.090
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't find an herbivore that eats carry on.</v>

1212
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:08.560
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't find it.</v>

1214
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:09.873
<v Speaker 3>And so we said,</v>

1215
00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1216
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:11.500
<v Speaker 3>there must be a reason.</v>

1217
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.733
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1218
00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:14.320
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1219
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:14.771
<v Speaker 3>and here,</v>

1220
00:39:14.771 --> 00:39:15.640
<v Speaker 3>30 years later,</v>

1221
00:39:15.641 --> 00:39:18.580
<v Speaker 3>suddenly there's this big global collective,</v>

1222
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:19.450
<v Speaker 3>oops,</v>

1223
00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:21.490
<v Speaker 3>maybe we should not have done that,</v>

1224
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1225
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.730
<v Speaker 3>as the whole scientific community realized,</v>

1226
00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:25.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1227
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:26.343
<v Speaker 3>what had happened.</v>

1228
00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.490
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1229
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:28.001
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1230
00:39:28.001 --> 00:39:29.320
<v Speaker 3>so I just think there's a,</v>

1231
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:34.270
<v Speaker 3>that we have to appreciate that we are in western culture.</v>

1232
00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:34.481
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1233
00:39:34.481 --> 00:39:35.050
<v Speaker 3>we're a,</v>

1234
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:36.160
<v Speaker 3>we're a product of,</v>

1235
00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:36.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1236
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:37.271
<v Speaker 3>Grieco,</v>

1237
00:39:37.271 --> 00:39:37.781
<v Speaker 3>Roman,</v>

1238
00:39:37.781 --> 00:39:38.201
<v Speaker 3>western,</v>

1239
00:39:38.201 --> 00:39:38.921
<v Speaker 3>reductionist,</v>

1240
00:39:38.921 --> 00:39:39.880
<v Speaker 3>compartmentalized,</v>

1241
00:39:39.881 --> 00:39:40.600
<v Speaker 3>fragmented,</v>

1242
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.460
<v Speaker 3>systematized,</v>

1243
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 3>individualized,</v>

1244
00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:45.130
<v Speaker 3>a democratized parts oriented,</v>

1245
00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.110
<v Speaker 3>disconnected thinking.</v>

1246
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:50.050
<v Speaker 3>And there's an equally appropriate,</v>

1247
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.150
<v Speaker 3>a mindset from the east,</v>

1248
00:39:52.151 --> 00:39:52.511
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

1249
00:39:52.511 --> 00:39:53.410
<v Speaker 3>we're all connected,</v>

1250
00:39:53.411 --> 00:39:54.370
<v Speaker 3>we're all relatives.</v>

1251
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:55.630
<v Speaker 3>It's about holes,</v>

1252
00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:55.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1253
00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:56.741
<v Speaker 3>it's about us,</v>

1254
00:39:56.741 --> 00:39:57.580
<v Speaker 3>not just me.</v>

1255
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:02.650
<v Speaker 3>And that brings us an ethical framework as a,</v>

1256
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:03.543
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

1257
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.500
<v Speaker 3>as a protection over all moral innovation.</v>

1258
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:09.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1259
00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.330
<v Speaker 3>we're so clever.</v>

1260
00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.180
<v Speaker 3>We can innovate things that we can't spiritually,</v>

1261
00:40:13.181 --> 00:40:13.780
<v Speaker 3>morally,</v>

1262
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:14.613
<v Speaker 3>ethically,</v>

1263
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.480
<v Speaker 3>or physically metabolize.</v>

1264
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:21.120
<v Speaker 3>And so what happens is we innovate these things and then,</v>

1265
00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:22.180
<v Speaker 3>and then spend,</v>

1266
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:23.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1267
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:25.270
<v Speaker 3>two generations trying to remediate,</v>

1268
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.870
<v Speaker 3>remediate the collateral damage that are innovations did.</v>

1269
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:31.670
<v Speaker 3>And if we would just embrace that there is,</v>

1270
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.700
<v Speaker 3>there should be a moral,</v>

1271
00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:34.534
<v Speaker 3>ethical,</v>

1272
00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:34.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1273
00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:35.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1274
00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:36.730
<v Speaker 3>natural pattern</v>

1275
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:39.910
<v Speaker 3>that restricts,</v>

1276
00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.010
<v Speaker 3>that constrains our innovation.</v>

1277
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:45.010
<v Speaker 3>Then our innovation could actually be kept on a,</v>

1278
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:45.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1279
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:50.850
<v Speaker 3>on an earth massaging tract track instead of an earth conquistador track.</v>

1280
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:56.670
<v Speaker 3>So you used to literally get courted to feed dead cows to cows like,</v>

1281
00:40:57.850 --> 00:40:58.001
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1282
00:40:58.001 --> 00:40:58.631
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

00:41:00.011 --> 00:41:01.570
<v Speaker 3>come out and uh,</v>

00:41:01.841 --> 00:41:03.150
<v Speaker 3>they've got sponsors,</v>

1288
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1289
00:41:03.401 --> 00:41:03.970
<v Speaker 3>the logo,</v>

1290
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:04.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1291
00:41:04.181 --> 00:41:05.910
<v Speaker 3>agribusiness community and uh,</v>

1292
00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:07.203
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1293

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1294
00:41:07.961 --> 00:41:08.980
<v Speaker 3>the industrial,</v>

1295

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1297
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.630
<v Speaker 3>food and you know,</v>

1298
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:11.980
<v Speaker 3>the industrial complex would,</v>

1299
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:12.400
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

1300
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.233
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1301
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:14.470
<v Speaker 3>buy dinner and,</v>

1302
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:15.791
<v Speaker 3>and you'd go here,</v>

1303
00:41:15.791 --> 00:41:16.070
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1304
00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:16.271
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1305
00:41:16.271 --> 00:41:20.650
<v Speaker 3>these couple phds from the taxpayer funded research universities,</v>

1306
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:20.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1307
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:22.120
<v Speaker 3>what was their motivation?</v>

1308
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1309
00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why they faster,</v>

1310
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:24.820
<v Speaker 3>bigger,</v>

1311
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:25.540
<v Speaker 3>cheaper,</v>

1312
00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.340
<v Speaker 3>faster it cheap,</v>

1313
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:28.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1314
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.313
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1315
00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:30.700
<v Speaker 3>it's cheap.</v>

1316
00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.210
<v Speaker 3>It's cheap protein to cheap,</v>

1317
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:33.951
<v Speaker 3>cheap food,</v>

1318
00:41:33.951 --> 00:41:34.360
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

1319
00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.340
<v Speaker 3>but the idea of making your cows cannibals.</v>

1320
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:38.031
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1321
00:41:38.031 --> 00:41:38.211
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1322
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:38.341
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1323
00:41:38.341 --> 00:41:38.481
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1324
00:41:38.481 --> 00:41:38.601
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1325
00:41:38.601 --> 00:41:41.180
<v Speaker 3>the industry's still feeds chicken manure.</v>

1326
00:41:41.181 --> 00:41:41.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1327
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:44.690
<v Speaker 3>well we're still feeding in this country right now as we sit here.</v>

1328
00:41:44.691 --> 00:41:48.170
<v Speaker 3>We're still feeding chicken feathers manure and chicken carcasses to chicken.</v>

1329
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:50.930
<v Speaker 3>They're doing it right in our neighborhood.</v>

1330
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:51.520
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1331
00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.820
<v Speaker 3>so that's still being done.</v>

1332
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.920
<v Speaker 3>So we're still feeding but not but at least,</v>

1333
00:41:54.921 --> 00:41:56.240
<v Speaker 3>but at least it's not cows,</v>

1334
00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:57.563
<v Speaker 3>at least knockout.</v>

1335
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:58.270
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1336
00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.361
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1337
00:41:58.361 --> 00:41:59.630
<v Speaker 3>it's completely absurd.</v>

1338
00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Why is it better to do with chickens and cows will supposedly it's not the same</v>

1339
00:42:04.551 --> 00:42:05.330
<v Speaker 3>kind of tissue.</v>

1340
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:05.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1341
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:06.150
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1342
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1343
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.140
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>

1344
00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.140
<v Speaker 3>it's at least it's one species removed,</v>

1345
00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:09.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1346
00:42:09.351 --> 00:42:10.184
<v Speaker 3>so you have some,</v>

1347
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:11.860
<v Speaker 3>you have a little bit of wiggle room for the,</v>

1348
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:16.900
<v Speaker 3>for the rogue prions that create the bovine spongiform encephalopathy and that's</v>

1349
00:42:16.971 --> 00:42:20.420
<v Speaker 3>the same disease that these cows getting mad cow disease,</v>

1350
00:42:20.421 --> 00:42:22.370
<v Speaker 3>the cannibals get and like in New Guinea,</v>

1351
00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:26.280
<v Speaker 3>these neurological disease where they can try on's.</v>

1352
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:26.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1353
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.200
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

1354
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:27.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1355
00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.450
<v Speaker 3>It punches holes in your brain.</v>

1356
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1357
00:42:29.871 --> 00:42:30.770
<v Speaker 3>It's a pretty uh,</v>

1358
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.170
<v Speaker 3>it's a pretty bad way to go.</v>

1359
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 3>It seems pretty dark.</v>

1360
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.820
<v Speaker 3>When did factory farming start?</v>

1361
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>

1362
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:41.000
<v Speaker 3>what we consider today factory farming?</v>

1363
00:42:41.001 --> 00:42:41.900
<v Speaker 3>When did all that start?</v>

1364
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1365
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.171
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1366
00:42:42.171 --> 00:42:45.860
<v Speaker 3>it's a great question and it really started in the thirties,</v>

1367
00:42:45.861 --> 00:42:47.150
<v Speaker 3>forties and fifties.</v>

1368
00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.393
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1369
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.500
<v Speaker 3>a lot of things had to come together and of course,</v>

1370
00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1371
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:53.330
<v Speaker 3>Michael Pollan in his,</v>

1372
00:42:53.331 --> 00:42:53.461
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1373
00:42:53.461 --> 00:42:54.920
<v Speaker 3>I think omnivore's dilemma,</v>

1374
00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:55.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1375
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.740
<v Speaker 3>examined this pretty nicely,</v>

1376
00:42:57.741 --> 00:43:02.420
<v Speaker 3>but to point out that or Eric Schlosser and fast food nation,</v>

1377
00:43:02.421 --> 00:43:02.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1378
00:43:02.541 --> 00:43:03.740
<v Speaker 3>that was a blockbuster,</v>

1379
00:43:03.741 --> 00:43:03.951
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1380
00:43:03.951 --> 00:43:08.030
<v Speaker 3>when it came out and a lot of factors had to be in place.</v>

1381
00:43:08.031 --> 00:43:11.810
<v Speaker 3>One was we had to have cheap energy because prior to,</v>

1382
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:13.640
<v Speaker 3>in order to have a factory farm,</v>

1383
00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.530
<v Speaker 3>you have to have cheap transportation in order to bring in order to concentrate</v>

1384
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:24.430
<v Speaker 3>that many beings in one place and feed them and remove their excrement.</v>

1385
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:27.770
<v Speaker 3>You have to have cheap transportation.</v>

1386
00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:28.820
<v Speaker 3>Cheap transportation,</v>

1387
00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:29.421
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1388
00:43:29.421 --> 00:43:30.680
<v Speaker 3>requires cheap energy.</v>

1389
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.911
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1390
00:43:31.911 --> 00:43:33.650
<v Speaker 3>when everything was draft power,</v>

1391
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.480
<v Speaker 3>mules and horses and oxen,</v>

1392
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:39.230
<v Speaker 3>you simply couldn't amalgamate that many things,</v>

1393
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.650
<v Speaker 3>whether it was animals or shoes or,</v>

1394
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.150
<v Speaker 3>or metal,</v>

1395
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1396
00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.560
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't amalgamate that much material in,</v>

1397
00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:50.003
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1398
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:50.840
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1399
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.740
<v Speaker 3>in one place.</v>

1400
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:52.400
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1401
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.250
<v Speaker 3>so every manufacturing facility,</v>

1402
00:43:55.251 --> 00:43:57.800
<v Speaker 3>whether it was a farm or you know,</v>

1403
00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.960
<v Speaker 3>other manufacturing had to nest within the carrying capacity of its ecological</v>

1404
00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:04.791
<v Speaker 3>womb,</v>

1405
00:44:04.791 --> 00:44:05.340
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>

1406
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.110
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

1407
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:06.950
<v Speaker 3>there was a limit,</v>

1408
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.810
<v Speaker 3>how far can we cart stuff in and how far can we cart stuff out.</v>

1409
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:15.590
<v Speaker 3>There was a limit to that until we had cheap energy and cheap transportation.</v>

1410
00:44:15.591 --> 00:44:18.050
<v Speaker 3>So that really catapulted this.</v>

1411
00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.640
<v Speaker 3>Then the next thing we had to have,</v>

1412
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.010
<v Speaker 3>we had to have people water,</v>

1413
00:44:22.011 --> 00:44:22.844
<v Speaker 3>we had to have.</v>

1414
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:23.221
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1415
00:44:23.221 --> 00:44:24.590
<v Speaker 3>so that meant plastic piping.</v>

1416
00:44:24.591 --> 00:44:26.000
<v Speaker 3>We had to have very cheap piping.</v>

1417
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:26.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1418
00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:28.670
<v Speaker 3>until then it was all cast iron pipe,</v>

1419
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:29.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1420
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.020
<v Speaker 3>in the 18 hundreds,</v>

1421
00:44:30.021 --> 00:44:30.530
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1422
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:31.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1423
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:35.430
<v Speaker 3>took a piece of wood and took an Auger and boarded out,</v>

1424
00:44:35.431 --> 00:44:35.821
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1425
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:35.891
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1426
00:44:35.891 --> 00:44:38.160
<v Speaker 3>and pasted little pipes together.</v>

1427
00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:40.980
<v Speaker 3>So we had to have a plastic,</v>

1428
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.540
<v Speaker 3>so plastic had to be developed,</v>

1429
00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.310
<v Speaker 3>which of course required petroleum.</v>

1430
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:46.080
<v Speaker 3>So petroleum was really a catalyst.</v>

1431
00:44:46.081 --> 00:44:46.980
<v Speaker 3>And then finally,</v>

1432
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:52.110
<v Speaker 3>in order to keep that many animals alive in one spot required antibiotics</v>

1433
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.390
<v Speaker 3>because the fecal particulate,</v>

1434
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.300
<v Speaker 3>the fecal dust cloud that they live in,</v>

1435
00:44:57.301 --> 00:45:01.320
<v Speaker 3>that they ingest is very abrasive to the very tender,</v>

1436
00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.533
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1437
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.863
<v Speaker 3>mucus,</v>

1438
00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.340
<v Speaker 3>respiratory membranes,</v>

1439
00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.010
<v Speaker 3>all the Caelian,</v>

1440
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:07.320
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1441
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.120
<v Speaker 3>those very,</v>

1442
00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:08.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1443
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1444
00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:10.770
<v Speaker 3>you look at them under a microscope and it's,</v>

1445
00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:11.853
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>

1446
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.210
<v Speaker 3>it's like going into a Steven Spielberg set,</v>

1447
00:45:15.211 --> 00:45:15.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1448
00:45:15.481 --> 00:45:16.560
<v Speaker 3>it's just amazing.</v>

1449
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1450
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.850
<v Speaker 3>those very tender mucous membranes</v>

1451
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.270
<v Speaker 3>get sandpaper by this,</v>

1452
00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:24.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1453
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.070
<v Speaker 3>fecal particulate,</v>

1454
00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:29.640
<v Speaker 3>this a brace of air and they bleed then.</v>

1455
00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:34.860
<v Speaker 3>And this is how Salmonella and in some of these things get into the,</v>

1456
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.040
<v Speaker 3>into the actual tissue,</v>

1457
00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:39.060
<v Speaker 3>even into the eggs.</v>

1458
00:45:39.061 --> 00:45:41.520
<v Speaker 3>Remember the Wisconsin farm with the Salmonella,</v>

1459
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.940
<v Speaker 3>it actually gets into the oviduct because now the old the bodies,</v>

1460
00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.153
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1461
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.950
<v Speaker 3>toxic hedges,</v>

1462
00:45:49.951 --> 00:45:50.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1463
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:50.931
<v Speaker 3>filters,</v>

1464
00:45:50.931 --> 00:45:51.764
<v Speaker 3>it's strainers,</v>

1465
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:54.360
<v Speaker 3>have been overridden by this,</v>

1466
00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:55.943
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1467
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:56.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1468
00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:01.380
<v Speaker 3>by this direct hemorrhaging of the tinder mucous membranes,</v>

1469
00:46:01.381 --> 00:46:02.820
<v Speaker 3>it gets right into the bloodstream.</v>

1470
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.860
<v Speaker 3>So that's how it,</v>

1471
00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1472
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:04.320
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1473
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.940
<v Speaker 3>it jumps those regular,</v>

1474
00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.253
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1475
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:08.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1476
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:08.993
<v Speaker 3>strainers.</v>

1477
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.031
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1478
00:46:11.031 --> 00:46:15.240
<v Speaker 3>so the antibiotics were necessary to try to,</v>

1479
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:16.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1480
00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.930
<v Speaker 3>in order to keep the animals in such an unsterile,</v>

1481
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:22.080
<v Speaker 3>an unhealthy environment to keep them alive.</v>

1482
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know whether you've watched just lately what's happened with pigs.</v>

1483
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:27.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm Jay.</v>

1484
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.540
<v Speaker 3>It's been all over the newspapers and Wall Street Journal even,</v>

1485
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:31.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1486
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:33.780
<v Speaker 3>when you see pig futures at Wall Street Journal,</v>

1487
00:46:33.781 --> 00:46:34.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1488
00:46:34.051 --> 00:46:35.130
<v Speaker 3>something's going on.</v>

1489
00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.331
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1490
00:46:36.331 --> 00:46:39.150
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in January and February,</v>

1491
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.410
<v Speaker 3>they almost doubled.</v>

1492
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.340
<v Speaker 3>What's the problem?</v>

1493
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.470
<v Speaker 3>Starting April one last year,</v>

1494
00:46:43.471 --> 00:46:44.610
<v Speaker 3>just April one last year.</v>

1495
00:46:44.611 --> 00:46:44.941
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>

1496
00:46:44.941 --> 00:46:45.300
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1497
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:45.690
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1498
00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:48.570
<v Speaker 3>we're literally 12 months into this exactly 12 months,</v>

1499
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:54.320
<v Speaker 3>the industry started losing one in four piggies industrywide to a viral</v>

1500
00:46:56.281 --> 00:46:57.114
<v Speaker 3>diarrhea.</v>

1501
00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:58.171
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1502
00:46:58.171 --> 00:46:59.100
<v Speaker 3>my joke is,</v>

1503
00:46:59.300 --> 00:46:59.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1504
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.710
<v Speaker 3>if there's one thing worse than diarrhea,</v>

1505
00:47:01.711 --> 00:47:03.840
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be viral diarrhea,</v>

1506
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:04.853
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1507
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:05.820
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

1508
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1509
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.140
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1510
00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:07.590
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1511
00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:08.423
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1512
00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.550
<v Speaker 3>this is attacking the industrial pigs.</v>

1513
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:15.420
<v Speaker 3>We're not seeing it out in the countryside and pastured pigs and are sort of</v>

1514
00:47:15.421 --> 00:47:16.050
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1515
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:20.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's making a pork futures skyrocket.</v>

1516
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.990
<v Speaker 3>The industry is on it's heels.</v>

1517
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:23.610
<v Speaker 3>They're desperate to find a,</v>

1518
00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:25.500
<v Speaker 3>find a cure.</v>

1519
00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:25.771
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1520
00:47:25.771 --> 00:47:26.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1521
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.440
<v Speaker 3>finding a cure would mean changing their model,</v>

1522
00:47:29.441 --> 00:47:30.274
<v Speaker 3>but of course they're,</v>

1523
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.830
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to find a technological cure,</v>

1524
00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:33.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1525
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.250
<v Speaker 3>some more potent concoction.</v>

1526
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.180
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

1527
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.970
<v Speaker 3>to knock this out in such an,</v>

1528
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:40.930
<v Speaker 3>an unhealthy environment.</v>

1529
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:43.250
<v Speaker 3>And so imagine that,</v>

1530
00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:43.511
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1531
00:47:43.511 --> 00:47:44.200
<v Speaker 3>nationwide,</v>

1532
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:44.951
<v Speaker 3>of all the whatever,</v>

1533
00:47:44.951 --> 00:47:45.820
<v Speaker 3>millions of pigs,</v>

1534
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.560
<v Speaker 3>one in four,</v>

1535
00:47:47.561 --> 00:47:52.561
<v Speaker 3>25 percent of all piggies right now being born in the US are dying from viral</v>

1536
00:47:54.011 --> 00:47:54.660
<v Speaker 3>diarrhea.</v>

1537
00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:55.560
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

1538
00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:56.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1539
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.420
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1540
00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.330
<v Speaker 4>it's a big deal,</v>

1541
00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.140
<v Speaker 4>big deal.</v>

1542
00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.820
<v Speaker 4>This environment that you're talking about,</v>

1543
00:47:59.821 --> 00:48:01.820
<v Speaker 4>this pathogen enriched environment where they're,</v>

1544
00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:04.050
<v Speaker 4>they're the fetal particulates in the air,</v>

1545
00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.110
<v Speaker 4>completely not natural in nature.</v>

1546
00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:12.480
<v Speaker 4>There are wide open fields in the EHR and the natural environment filters all of</v>

1547
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:13.620
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1548
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:16.530
<v Speaker 4>Is this something that's completely been over the last,</v>

1549
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:17.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1550
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:18.830
<v Speaker 4>less than 100 years now?</v>

1551
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:20.460
<v Speaker 4>It's very recent.</v>

1552
00:48:20.461 --> 00:48:21.540
<v Speaker 4>It's only in the last,</v>

1553
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:22.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1554
00:48:22.021 --> 00:48:23.280
<v Speaker 4>50 to 60 years.</v>

1555
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:23.900
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1556
00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:28.470
<v Speaker 3>our rule of thumb is that a good food production,</v>

1557
00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:29.700
<v Speaker 3>good farming,</v>

1558
00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:34.140
<v Speaker 4>good food production should be aesthetically and aromatically.</v>

1559
00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.030
<v Speaker 4>Sensually romantic,</v>

1560
00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.393
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1561
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1562
00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:38.490
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1563
00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:42.420
<v Speaker 4>if you've got a walk through sheep dip and put on a hazmat suit to go visit your</v>

1564
00:48:42.421 --> 00:48:43.170
<v Speaker 4>food,</v>

1565
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:44.490
<v Speaker 4>you might not want to eat it.</v>

1566
00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:45.923
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1567
00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:47.610
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1568
00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:48.443
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

1569
00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:49.470
<v Speaker 4>Now this,</v>

1570
00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:52.320
<v Speaker 4>this idea of factory farming,</v>

1571
00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:53.090
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1572
00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:58.090
<v Speaker 4>this huge large scale thing where you're stuffing all these chickens into,</v>

1573
00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:59.130
<v Speaker 4>could,</v>

1574
00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:04.130
<v Speaker 4>could those farms be converted to a more holistic approach like you're,</v>

1575
00:49:04.291 --> 00:49:05.730
<v Speaker 4>you're prescribing.</v>

1576
00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.990
<v Speaker 3>That is such a great question.</v>

1577
00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:10.750
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1578
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:13.200
<v Speaker 3>and I'll tell you the truth.</v>

1579
00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:18.410
<v Speaker 3>My heart goes out to farmers who have signed on the dotted line and,</v>

1580
00:49:18.951 --> 00:49:19.730
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1581
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:21.870
<v Speaker 3>and been kind of taken in by this,</v>

1582
00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.130
<v Speaker 3>by this model,</v>

1583
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:28.670
<v Speaker 3>but the fact is they are so anti nature that I don't see a retrofit a.</v>

1584
00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:39.150
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the problems when you have capital intensive infrastructure,</v>

1585
00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.780
<v Speaker 3>when you have single,</v>

1586
00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:45.030
<v Speaker 3>single designed or single use capital intensive infrastructure,</v>

1587
00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:50.570
<v Speaker 3>even when it becomes a detriment to society to have that infrastructure,</v>

1588
00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:56.370
<v Speaker 3>we still have to use it because we're economically and emotionally vested in it.</v>

1589
00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:57.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1590
00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:59.850
<v Speaker 3>our toys run our thinking.</v>

1591
00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:01.333
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1592
00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:01.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1593
00:50:01.651 --> 00:50:01.830
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1594
00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:02.663
<v Speaker 3>look at,</v>

1595
00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:04.980
<v Speaker 3>look at the health field.</v>

1596
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1597
00:50:05.491 --> 00:50:05.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1598
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:09.940
<v Speaker 3>we have to use our infrastructure because it's really expensive and so we've got</v>

1599
00:50:09.941 --> 00:50:10.890
<v Speaker 3>to use this stuff.</v>

1600
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.230
<v Speaker 3>And the same thing is true in farming.</v>

1601
00:50:13.231 --> 00:50:13.490
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1602
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1603
00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.890
<v Speaker 3>when you pour that much concrete and bend that much rebar,</v>

1604
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.153
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1605
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.321
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1606
00:50:19.321 --> 00:50:19.800
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1607
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.720
<v Speaker 3>you feel compelled to use it.</v>

1608
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.161
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>

1609
00:50:23.161 --> 00:50:24.150
<v Speaker 3>it's a real problem.</v>

1610
00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.560
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1611
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 3>and I just,</v>

1612
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:28.223
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1613
00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:31.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1614
00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:36.410
<v Speaker 3>I just don't see really efficient ways of retrofitting a lot of these</v>

1615
00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:38.903
<v Speaker 3>structures.</v>

1616
00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:39.770
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1617
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:40.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1618
00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.600
<v Speaker 3>they might make good miniature golf courses.</v>

1619
00:50:42.601 --> 00:50:43.434
<v Speaker 3>They might,</v>

1620
00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:44.443
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1621
00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:45.453
<v Speaker 3>mail though.</v>

1622
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:47.783
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

1623
00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1624
00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:49.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1625
00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:50.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1626
00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:50.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1627
00:50:50.491 --> 00:50:51.324
<v Speaker 3>just to give you,</v>

1628
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:55.860
<v Speaker 3>to give you an example of some things that can be done with a different model.</v>

1629
00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.533
<v Speaker 3>One is,</v>

1630
00:50:58.290 --> 00:50:59.370
<v Speaker 3>just to give you an example,</v>

1631
00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:04.090
<v Speaker 3>one is that if you go to a composting betting in a,</v>

1632
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:04.650
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

1633
00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:05.700
<v Speaker 3>in an operation,</v>

1634
00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:06.933
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1635
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.180
<v Speaker 3>you can ameliorate a lot of the problems.</v>

1636
00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:11.880
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that that takes a lot of carbon.</v>

1637
00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:14.760
<v Speaker 3>In order to have compost,</v>

1638
00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:20.930
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a carbon nitrogen ratio that somewhere in the neighborhood of</v>

1639
00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.520
<v Speaker 3>25 to 35 to one.</v>

1640
00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:24.810
<v Speaker 3>All right can,</v>

1641
00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.130
<v Speaker 3>it's called the CN ratio.</v>

1642
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:28.320
<v Speaker 3>And of course you have to have,</v>

1643
00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.030
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a moisture,</v>

1644
00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.040
<v Speaker 3>you have to have air and you have to have microbes.</v>

1645
00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:34.800
<v Speaker 3>So there's five components to a mike to a compost pile,</v>

1646
00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:39.630
<v Speaker 3>but you have to have one other thing and that is enough size to support an</v>

1647
00:51:39.631 --> 00:51:41.820
<v Speaker 3>internal community of microbial beings.</v>

1648
00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:42.451
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah,</v>

1649
00:51:42.451 --> 00:51:43.320
<v Speaker 3>they've got to have their,</v>

1650
00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:44.213
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1651
00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.151
<v Speaker 3>TV shows.</v>

1652
00:51:45.151 --> 00:51:46.140
<v Speaker 3>I got to build their roads,</v>

1653
00:51:46.141 --> 00:51:46.891
<v Speaker 3>have their schools,</v>

1654
00:51:46.891 --> 00:51:47.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1655
00:51:47.311 --> 00:51:50.640
<v Speaker 3>and I have banks and politicians and stuff too.</v>

1656
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:51.320
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>

1657
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:56.320
<v Speaker 3>it takes room for these microorganisms to build those communities.</v>

1658
00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.620
<v Speaker 3>You can't build.</v>

1659
00:51:58.621 --> 00:52:01.530
<v Speaker 3>A compost pile is 12 inches by 12 inches by 12 inches.</v>

1660
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:02.543
<v Speaker 3>Too small.</v>

1661
00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:05.400
<v Speaker 3>The smallest size is like a yard by yard,</v>

1662
00:52:05.401 --> 00:52:06.234
<v Speaker 3>by yard.</v>

1663
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:07.213
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1664
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:08.203
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1665
00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:14.330
<v Speaker 3>the problem is that in most you know a factory farming facilities,</v>

1666
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:22.070
<v Speaker 3>you can not only can you not even have any bedding in or the animals are on</v>

1667
00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:26.410
<v Speaker 3>slatted floors or virtually a note concrete there.</v>

1668
00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:28.830
<v Speaker 3>There is no life.</v>

1669
00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:32.130
<v Speaker 3>There is no community of beings,</v>

1670
00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:36.030
<v Speaker 3>good community of beings in nature.</v>

1671
00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:40.500
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't realize there are a lot more good bacteria than bad</v>

1672
00:52:40.501 --> 00:52:40.861
<v Speaker 3>bacteria.</v>

1673
00:52:40.861 --> 00:52:43.740
<v Speaker 3>There really aren't that many bad bacteria in nature.</v>

1674
00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:44.370
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1675
00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:46.220
<v Speaker 3>if you're keeping score of,</v>

1676
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:47.670
<v Speaker 3>of of things,</v>

1677
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:50.280
<v Speaker 3>there actually a lot more good ones than bad ones.</v>

1678
00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:55.310
<v Speaker 3>When you come to this invisible world of little microbial beings and and so the</v>

1679
00:52:56.401 --> 00:52:57.450
<v Speaker 3>default position,</v>

1680
00:52:57.451 --> 00:52:59.910
<v Speaker 3>what I'm getting to is the default position of nature,</v>

1681
00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:01.373
<v Speaker 3>his health.</v>

1682
00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.350
<v Speaker 3>We in our culture right now,</v>

1683
00:53:05.351 --> 00:53:10.351
<v Speaker 3>we've got things so out of whack that we just assume that the default position</v>

1684
00:53:10.781 --> 00:53:11.980
<v Speaker 3>of nature is sickness.</v>

1685
00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Nature's broken and I've got to fix it.</v>

1686
00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:15.730
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

1687
00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.790
<v Speaker 3>The default position of nature is wellness and health.</v>

1688
00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:24.420
<v Speaker 3>If if their sickness then then that indicates something out of whack.</v>

1689
00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:25.880
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

1690
00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1691
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:26.993
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1692
00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:28.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a protocol has been violated.</v>

1693
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:34.110
<v Speaker 3>So one of the ways to house animals,</v>

1694
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.720
<v Speaker 3>at least temporarily in shelter,</v>

1695
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:38.880
<v Speaker 3>is to have a living,</v>

1696
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:40.673
<v Speaker 3>a living,</v>

1697
00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.113
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1698
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.493
<v Speaker 3>blanket,</v>

1699
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:49.190
<v Speaker 3>I call it a carbonaceous diaper for them to live on a that is deep enough and</v>

1700
00:53:51.001 --> 00:53:56.001
<v Speaker 3>alive enough with all these microbes so that Neba toads attack the pathogenic</v>

1701
00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:57.601
<v Speaker 3>microbes.</v>

1702
00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:58.200
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

1703
00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:58.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1704
00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.011
<v Speaker 3>in this,</v>

1705
00:53:59.011 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 3>in this sphere,</v>

1706
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:01.710
<v Speaker 3>there's enough,</v>

1707
00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:02.763
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1708
00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:07.470
<v Speaker 3>community of beings interacting in this war of good bugs and bad bugs.</v>

1709
00:54:07.471 --> 00:54:09.090
<v Speaker 3>The good bugs beat out the bad bugs.</v>

1710
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.910
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1711
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:11.130
<v Speaker 3>that's the right position.</v>

1712
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.930
<v Speaker 3>And that can be done.</v>

1713
00:54:12.931 --> 00:54:16.410
<v Speaker 3>And we actually used that when we feed hay in the winter time in our hay shed,</v>

1714
00:54:16.411 --> 00:54:20.280
<v Speaker 3>we use it for the pigs in the winter when they're in housing for the,</v>

1715
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:22.080
<v Speaker 3>for the brooder house where we start chicks,</v>

1716
00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:23.041
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1717
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:23.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1718
00:54:23.311 --> 00:54:27.290
<v Speaker 3>we have it where we can build up 24 inches of bedding in the hay shed with the</v>

1719
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:27.571
<v Speaker 3>cows.</v>

1720
00:54:27.571 --> 00:54:31.650
<v Speaker 3>We can go four feet deep with this carbonaceous living,</v>

1721
00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:35.010
<v Speaker 3>composting a bedding and um,</v>

1722
00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:36.010
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1723
00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:36.111
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1724
00:54:36.111 --> 00:54:38.310
<v Speaker 3>and that is a partial answer,</v>

1725
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:45.110
<v Speaker 3>but the buildings that are currently designed can't handle a living,</v>

1726
00:54:45.661 --> 00:54:49.250
<v Speaker 3>compost medium for the animals to be on their street.</v>

1727
00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.720
<v Speaker 3>They're structurally not designed to handle that.</v>

1728
00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:53.123
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1729
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:54.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1730
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.250
<v Speaker 3>the retrofit becomes pretty tough.</v>

1731
00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:57.930
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>

1732
00:54:57.931 --> 00:55:00.930
<v Speaker 4>So it's almost like they need to be destroyed and it needs to be start from</v>

1733
00:55:00.931 --> 00:55:01.764
<v Speaker 4>scratch.</v>

1734
00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1735
00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:03.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1736
00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:03.800
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1737
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:04.131
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1738
00:55:04.131 --> 00:55:04.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1739
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:09.470
<v Speaker 3>the beautiful thing is really they don't need to be replaced with very much.</v>

1740
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:13.470
<v Speaker 3>They just need to be abandoned.</v>

1741
00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:15.333
<v Speaker 3>Most,</v>

1742
00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:16.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1743
00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:17.250
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>

1744
00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:17.641
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>

1745
00:55:17.641 --> 00:55:18.474
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>

1746
00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:20.580
<v Speaker 3>most great breakthroughs throughout history.</v>

1747
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.860
<v Speaker 3>Breakthroughs have been break widths.</v>

1748
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.233
<v Speaker 3>Something.</v>

1749
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.220
<v Speaker 3>Think about the breakthrough for,</v>

1750
00:55:26.221 --> 00:55:26.881
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1751
00:55:26.881 --> 00:55:27.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1752
00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:28.440
<v Speaker 3>compact discs.</v>

1753
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:29.843
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1754
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:33.780
<v Speaker 3>the Germans tried to do it for a long time,</v>

1755
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:38.970
<v Speaker 3>but they couldn't get past the long play disk model,</v>

1756
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:39.863
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1757
00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:40.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1758
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:44.850
<v Speaker 3>that we just can't do it in the Japanese who didn't have a history of LP records</v>

1759
00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:45.960
<v Speaker 3>like Germany did.</v>

1760
00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:46.651
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

1761
00:55:46.651 --> 00:55:47.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1762
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.270
<v Speaker 3>why does it have to be,</v>

1763
00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:48.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1764
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.673
<v Speaker 3>this size,</v>

1765
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:50.820
<v Speaker 3>let's make it smaller.</v>

1766
00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:51.360
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

1767
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Japanese owned,</v>

1768
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1769
00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:54.120
<v Speaker 3>that whole market,</v>

1770
00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:54.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1771
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:59.070
<v Speaker 3>so it was a break with tradition and many innovations,</v>

1772
00:55:59.071 --> 00:56:01.200
<v Speaker 3>many innovative things.</v>

1773
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Our break widths,</v>

1774
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:06.350
<v Speaker 3>that's the key to the breakthrough.</v>

1775
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:07.510
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of,</v>

1776
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.720
<v Speaker 3>a lot of</v>

1777
00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.170
<v Speaker 4>people that don't realize that what we're dealing with when you're talking about</v>

1778
00:56:11.171 --> 00:56:15.160
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the flues and a lot of the diseases that become pandemics,</v>

1779
00:56:15.161 --> 00:56:16.780
<v Speaker 4>that they start with livestock,</v>

1780
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:18.370
<v Speaker 4>avian flu,</v>

1781
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:19.390
<v Speaker 4>swine flu,</v>

1782
00:56:19.391 --> 00:56:24.310
<v Speaker 4>some of the most horrific flus that we've experienced in the past hundred years</v>

1783
00:56:24.311 --> 00:56:27.100
<v Speaker 4>have come as a direct result of this type of farming.</v>

1784
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:28.001
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1785
00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:28.650
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1786
00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:28.990
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1787
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.823
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1788
00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:30.341
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1789
00:56:30.341 --> 00:56:31.174
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1790
00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:33.610
<v Speaker 3>the concentration,</v>

1791
00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:34.561
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1792
00:56:34.561 --> 00:56:38.410
<v Speaker 3>the total unnatural concentration and,</v>

1793
00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:42.340
<v Speaker 3>and buildup of toxicity in these places is incredible.</v>

1794
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:46.570
<v Speaker 3>And so what happens is that the industry uses concoctions,</v>

1795
00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:47.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1796
00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:47.950
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1797
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:48.470
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1798
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:51.640
<v Speaker 3>from something as benign as chlorine all the way to,</v>

1799
00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:52.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1800
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:56.470
<v Speaker 3>a stiffer stuff to try to sanitize clean,</v>

1801
00:56:56.471 --> 00:56:57.161
<v Speaker 3>wash down,</v>

1802
00:56:57.161 --> 00:56:57.994
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>

1803
00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.400
<v Speaker 3>But all that does is,</v>

1804
00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:01.563
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1805
00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:05.350
<v Speaker 3>is open the door for the survivors.</v>

1806
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:09.460
<v Speaker 3>And every and every time a new concoction is developed,</v>

1807
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:14.020
<v Speaker 3>there are survivors and the survivors become more and more virulent.</v>

1808
00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:15.731
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

1809
00:57:15.731 --> 00:57:16.331
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1810
00:57:16.331 --> 00:57:18.190
<v Speaker 3>when the industry says all look,</v>

1811
00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:19.001
<v Speaker 3>eat coal lie,</v>

1812
00:57:19.001 --> 00:57:20.290
<v Speaker 3>it's been around forever,</v>

1813
00:57:20.291 --> 00:57:21.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1814
00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:21.710
<v Speaker 3>get over it.</v>

1815
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:24.100
<v Speaker 3>A ECOLAB is part of a cow's digestion.</v>

1816
00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:26.140
<v Speaker 3>Well that's true,</v>

1817
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:31.410
<v Speaker 3>but not the virulent strains that we're developing by feeding unnatural feeds</v>

1818
00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:38.440
<v Speaker 3>and the drugs and so were,</v>

1819
00:57:38.441 --> 00:57:42.940
<v Speaker 3>those would normally be fairly benign in are highly acidic digestive system.</v>

1820
00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:48.960
<v Speaker 3>They become more virulent and they survive in us instead of us killing them.</v>

1821
00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:51.820
<v Speaker 3>And that's this evolution of things.</v>

1822
00:57:51.821 --> 00:57:52.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1823
00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:52.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1824
00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:53.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1825
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:53.861
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>

1826
00:57:53.861 --> 00:57:54.490
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1827
00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:54.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1828
00:57:54.701 --> 00:57:56.600
<v Speaker 3>Arkansas now where the,</v>

1829
00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:01.640
<v Speaker 3>where the farmers are now budgeting $70 per acre to hand machete super weeds</v>

1830
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:10.710
<v Speaker 3>that have morphed as a result of glyphosate roundup because of genetically</v>

1831
00:58:12.011 --> 00:58:13.090
<v Speaker 3>modified organism,</v>

1832
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:16.360
<v Speaker 3>a corn and soybeans being planted.</v>

1833
00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:17.610
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1834
00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:22.610
<v Speaker 3>it's created these survivor super weeds because everything,</v>

1835
00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:27.070
<v Speaker 3>whenever we try to sterilize or sanitize,</v>

1836
00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:32.320
<v Speaker 3>there are survivors and those survivors become tougher and tougher and tougher.</v>

1837
00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:33.970
<v Speaker 3>We are a bunch of dummies,</v>

1838
00:58:33.971 --> 00:58:34.804
<v Speaker 3>aren't we?</v>

1839
00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:37.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean really are as a human race.</v>

1840
00:58:37.621 --> 00:58:39.300
<v Speaker 4>We're just a bunch of silly dummies.</v>

1841
00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:40.111
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

1842
00:58:40.111 --> 00:58:40.590
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

1843
00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:41.371
<v Speaker 4>an issue that,</v>

1844
00:58:41.371 --> 00:58:41.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1845
00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:45.120
<v Speaker 4>is a big one with antibiotic soaps.</v>

1846
00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:49.140
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people think it's real smart to wash with antibiotic soaps,</v>

1847
00:58:49.141 --> 00:58:53.520
<v Speaker 4>but what they don't realize is the antibiotic soaps kill all the good flora on</v>

1848
00:58:53.521 --> 00:58:54.600
<v Speaker 4>your screen as well.</v>

1849
00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:58.020
<v Speaker 4>And it seems like that's really similar to what's going on here.</v>

1850
00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:58.760
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1851
00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:02.070
<v Speaker 4>Your talk of the live betting would,</v>

1852
00:59:02.071 --> 00:59:07.071
<v Speaker 4>that is his nature zone way of dealing with the passages instead of pumping some</v>

1853
00:59:07.171 --> 00:59:08.250
<v Speaker 4>chemicals into them.</v>

1854
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:09.250
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1855
00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:11.290
<v Speaker 3>And there's nothing unnatural about it.</v>

1856
00:59:11.291 --> 00:59:11.801
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

1857
00:59:11.801 --> 00:59:12.634
<v Speaker 3>you don't get.</v>

1858
00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:14.560
<v Speaker 3>You don't get virulent survivors.</v>

1859
00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:16.480
<v Speaker 3>They're all on an equal,</v>

1860
00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:17.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1861
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.000
<v Speaker 3>a creation playing field,</v>

1862
00:59:19.001 --> 00:59:19.834
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>

1863
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:20.110
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1864
00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:20.620
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1865
00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.080
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1866
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:21.820
<v Speaker 3>and all.</v>

1867
00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:25.580
<v Speaker 3>And our responsibility then is simply to create a habitat</v>

1868
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:28.460
<v Speaker 3>that allows this,</v>

1869
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:28.851
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1870
00:59:28.851 --> 00:59:29.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1871
00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:32.210
<v Speaker 3>battlefield to play out in its natural setting.</v>

1872
00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:36.650
<v Speaker 4>Natural setting is the key because there is a sort of a give and take,</v>

1873
00:59:36.651 --> 00:59:37.191
<v Speaker 4>a place,</v>

1874
00:59:37.191 --> 00:59:42.191
<v Speaker 4>a jigsaw puzzle piece place for all the various elements of a farm,</v>

1875
00:59:42.951 --> 00:59:44.150
<v Speaker 4>of an ecosystem.</v>

1876
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:46.430
<v Speaker 4>And that's what you're addressing when you're.</v>

1877
00:59:46.431 --> 00:59:48.730
<v Speaker 4>That's when I found so incredibly fascinating about the,</v>

1878
00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:53.510
<v Speaker 4>the idea of continuing to move these animals and you have these very low voltage</v>

1879
00:59:53.511 --> 00:59:55.250
<v Speaker 4>electric fences that are just enough.</v>

1880
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.091
<v Speaker 4>So they go up,</v>

1881
00:59:56.091 --> 00:59:57.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to go near there.</v>

1882
00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.070
<v Speaker 4>No one's getting hurt,</v>

1883
00:59:58.071 --> 00:59:58.904
<v Speaker 4>but they're like,</v>

1884
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:59.151
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1885
00:59:59.151 --> 00:59:59.371
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1886
00:59:59.371 --> 00:59:59.650
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1887
00:59:59.650 --> 00:59:59.870
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1888
00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:00.070
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1889
01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:04.490
<v Speaker 4>it's called a psychological barrier to essentially car battery you use,</v>

1890
01:00:04.491 --> 01:00:04.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1891
01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:05.710
<v Speaker 4>So it's portable.</v>

1892
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1893
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.833
<v Speaker 4>it's an energy.</v>

1894
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:07.710
<v Speaker 4>It's a car battery,</v>

1895
01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:08.451
<v Speaker 4>power car,</v>

1896
01:00:08.451 --> 01:00:08.980
<v Speaker 4>battery</v>

1897
01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:09.850
<v Speaker 3>and energizer.</v>

1898
01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1899
01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.190
<v Speaker 3>it has high voltage but no amperage.</v>

1900
01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:13.181
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1901
01:00:13.181 --> 01:00:13.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1902
01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:14.620
<v Speaker 3>you get a lot of pain,</v>

1903
01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.200
<v Speaker 3>but there's no danger because you're running like,</v>

1904
01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1905
01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:18.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1906
01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:19.240
<v Speaker 3>goodness,</v>

1907
01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:19.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1908
01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:20.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1909
01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:20.943
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1910
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:22.630
<v Speaker 3>a 20th of an amp.</v>

1911
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:23.231
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1912
01:00:23.231 --> 01:00:23.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

1913
01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.640
<v Speaker 3>there's no energy,</v>

1914
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.700
<v Speaker 3>but there's a.</v>

1915
01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.030
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1916
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.100
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of pressure.</v>

1917
01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.353
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1918
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:29.560
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

1919
01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:30.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1920
01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:30.560
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1921
01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:30.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1922
01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:31.510
<v Speaker 3>these systems,</v>

1923
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:32.080
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1924
01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.820
<v Speaker 3>these are computer microchip systems.</v>

1925
01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:34.470
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1926
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1927
01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:35.141
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1928
01:00:35.141 --> 01:00:36.610
<v Speaker 3>I think as we've talked about,</v>

1929
01:00:36.611 --> 01:00:38.470
<v Speaker 3>how did the factory farm develop?</v>

1930
01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:39.700
<v Speaker 3>I think perhaps,</v>

1931
01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:40.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1932
01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:43.090
<v Speaker 3>rather than a continuum,</v>

1933
01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.820
<v Speaker 3>you can go wherever you want to with the questions.</v>

1934
01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:51.180
<v Speaker 3>But I would like to to point out to folks that as bad as that is and depressing</v>

1935
01:00:52.961 --> 01:00:53.381
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

1936
01:00:53.381 --> 01:00:54.760
<v Speaker 3>we're a bunch of dummies and all that.</v>

1937
01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.013
<v Speaker 3>My goodness,</v>

1938
01:00:56.230 --> 01:01:01.230
<v Speaker 3>we have now innovated the most amazing infrastructure to be able for the first</v>

1939
01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:10.561
<v Speaker 3>time in human history to caress our Earth Nest,</v>

1940
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:12.521
<v Speaker 3>our lover,</v>

1941
01:01:12.521 --> 01:01:13.354
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>

1942
01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:19.530
<v Speaker 3>more strategically and purposely purposefully than we have ever been able to do</v>

1943
01:01:22.361 --> 01:01:23.194
<v Speaker 3>it before.</v>

1944
01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:26.260
<v Speaker 3>And the tech and the infrastructure is amazing.</v>

1945
01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.850
<v Speaker 3>One is electric fencing.</v>

1946
01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:29.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can now in,</v>

1947
01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:32.350
<v Speaker 3>in a wheelbarrow full of material,</v>

1948
01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:37.830
<v Speaker 3>you can now place hundreds of thousands of animals in a certain spot for a day</v>

1949
01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:43.780
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1950
01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:44.613
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1951
01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.190
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1952
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:50.190
<v Speaker 3>and manage carefully their intersection with a given piece of nature that's,</v>

1953
01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:51.940
<v Speaker 3>that's unprecedented.</v>

1954
01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:52.960
<v Speaker 3>We've never been able to do that before.</v>

1955
01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm week and we can protect them.</v>

1956
01:01:55.450 --> 01:02:00.450
<v Speaker 3>We can make them comfortable not with stationary barns and you know,</v>

1957
01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:01.840
<v Speaker 3>big post and beam,</v>

1958
01:02:01.841 --> 01:02:02.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1959
01:02:02.021 --> 01:02:03.940
<v Speaker 3>you have to cut down the whole forest to do this.</v>

1960
01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:09.270
<v Speaker 3>But now with bandsaw band saw a technology instead of,</v>

1961
01:02:10.451 --> 01:02:10.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1962
01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:14.560
<v Speaker 3>the big old circular saws that removed a quarter of an inch per cut.</v>

1963
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:18.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm now with a little Honda engine that,</v>

1964
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.930
<v Speaker 3>that saps that's just sips fuel and uh,</v>

1965
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:23.940
<v Speaker 3>and a one 10th of an inch thick,</v>

1966
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:25.730
<v Speaker 3>a bandsaw.</v>

1967
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:29.940
<v Speaker 3>We can now mill tinker toy,</v>

1968
01:02:29.941 --> 01:02:34.941
<v Speaker 3>like lab structure material to build very lightweight,</v>

1969
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.890
<v Speaker 3>portable barnes,</v>

1970
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:39.120
<v Speaker 3>portable shelters.</v>

1971
01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:40.070
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

1972
01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:41.160
<v Speaker 3>we use those on our farm.</v>

1973
01:02:41.161 --> 01:02:44.040
<v Speaker 3>We have all these portable infrastructures for Turkeys,</v>

1974
01:02:44.041 --> 01:02:44.551
<v Speaker 3>chickens,</v>

1975
01:02:44.551 --> 01:02:45.120
<v Speaker 3>cows,</v>

1976
01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:45.890
<v Speaker 3>pigs,</v>

1977
01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:46.723
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1978
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.760
<v Speaker 3>so that we can move a shade tree or a barn protective shelter with the animals,</v>

1979
01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.510
<v Speaker 3>with a four wheeler,</v>

1980
01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:58.363
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1981
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:59.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1982
01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.900
<v Speaker 3>a couple of guys pushing it along.</v>

1983
01:03:00.901 --> 01:03:01.734
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1984
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:04.560
<v Speaker 3>This portable infrastructure then,</v>

1985
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:06.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1986
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:11.750
<v Speaker 3>allows us to keep the animals controlled and comfortable.</v>

1987
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.850
<v Speaker 3>And with black pipe black pipe,</v>

1988
01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:18.690
<v Speaker 3>we can les miles with black power black plastic pipe.</v>

1989
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1990
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:24.590
<v Speaker 3>We can now develop a pond or a spring and put that water in a nice,</v>

1991
01:03:26.641 --> 01:03:27.474
<v Speaker 3>clean,</v>

1992
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:28.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1993
01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:29.010
<v Speaker 3>delivery system,</v>

1994
01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:33.000
<v Speaker 3>like the plumbing in your house and deliver it miles.</v>

1995
01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.590
<v Speaker 3>So the animals aren't,</v>

1996
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:35.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1997
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:36.840
<v Speaker 3>drinking out of their toilet.</v>

1998
01:03:36.841 --> 01:03:37.171
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

1999
01:03:37.171 --> 01:03:37.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2000
01:03:37.411 --> 01:03:39.540
<v Speaker 3>pooping and in drinking out of it and all that,</v>

2001
01:03:39.541 --> 01:03:41.730
<v Speaker 3>like you see that they're actually eating.</v>

2002
01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:44.220
<v Speaker 3>I drink out of the cal troughs.</v>

2003
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:44.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2004
01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:46.620
<v Speaker 3>that water's clean enough for me to drink.</v>

2005
01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:47.603
<v Speaker 3>You drink out of that.</v>

2006
01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.530
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely owe it.</v>

2007

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2024
01:04:09.661 --> 01:04:10.441
<v Speaker 3>ascorbic acid.</v>

2025
01:04:10.441 --> 01:04:11.041
<v Speaker 3>I'd take my,</v>

2026

01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:32.820
<v Speaker 3>I was starting a couple years ago,</v>

2044
01:04:32.821 --> 01:04:36.570
<v Speaker 3>I was starting into a kind of a fight or flight subconscious fight or flight</v>

2045
01:04:36.571 --> 01:04:37.404
<v Speaker 3>thing where I would get,</v>

2046
01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:38.280
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't breathe,</v>

2047
01:04:38.281 --> 01:04:38.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2048
01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:40.050
<v Speaker 3>on our airplane and stuff because it was,</v>

2049
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:40.970
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2052
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:45.443
<v Speaker 3>I went to a,</v>

2053
01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:49.400
<v Speaker 3>went to a quack and alternative medical practitioner that,</v>

2054
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:52.350
<v Speaker 3>that uses the kind of machines they use in Europe.</v>

2055
01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:52.761
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2056
01:04:52.761 --> 01:04:56.610
<v Speaker 3>when you go to the emergency room in Europe and you grab two probes and a little</v>

2057
01:04:56.611 --> 01:04:57.110
<v Speaker 3>needle,</v>

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:04.500
<v Speaker 3>that's how they can get along with government healthcare because they actually</v>

2065
01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:05.430
<v Speaker 3>are smart about it.</v>

2066
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.881
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2067
01:05:05.881 --> 01:05:08.640
<v Speaker 3>when these probes you hold on with your hands and they tell you what's wrong</v>

01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:51.760
<v Speaker 3>It went in with surgery and repaired that valve board.</v>

2098
01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.091
<v Speaker 3>It was doing,</v>

2099
01:05:52.091 --> 01:05:56.230
<v Speaker 3>it was letting my urine backup for my bladder backup into the kid.</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2104

2111
01:06:11.771 --> 01:06:12.191
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>

2112
01:06:12.191 --> 01:06:16.270
<v Speaker 3>It was the balloon was pushing the urine back up into the kidney.</v>

<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2185
01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:02.330
<v Speaker 4>they broke down doors and they had guns and they were wearing bulletproof vests</v>

2186
01:08:02.331 --> 01:08:02.951
<v Speaker 4>and they're just,</v>

2187
01:08:02.951 --> 01:08:05.660
<v Speaker 4>they're just a farm milk.</v>

2188
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:07.010
<v Speaker 4>And then somehow or another,</v>

2189
01:08:07.011 --> 01:08:11.420
<v Speaker 4>because we've made milk so toxic because of these environments that you're</v>

2190
01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:13.520
<v Speaker 4>describing that you would,</v>

2191
01:08:13.521 --> 01:08:14.930
<v Speaker 4>you drink raw milk on a</v>

2192
01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.181
<v Speaker 3>farm,</v>

2193
01:08:17.181 --> 01:08:19.810
<v Speaker 3>like your farm where the cows are healthy.</v>

2194
01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:23.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could drink that raw milk and it's actually easily digested.</v>

2195
01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Your body digests it far more easy.</v>

2196
01:08:25.341 --> 01:08:29.150
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people that are even lactose intolerant don't have a problem with</v>

2197
01:08:29.151 --> 01:08:29.930
<v Speaker 3>the raw milk.</v>

2198
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2199
01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:30.631
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2200
01:08:30.631 --> 01:08:30.980
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

2201
01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:31.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2202
01:08:31.161 --> 01:08:33.530
<v Speaker 3>the milk from an industrial farm is toxic.</v>

2203
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.270
<v Speaker 3>It does have a lot of problems.</v>

2204
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:39.350
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't realize that the Mayo Clinic was built.</v>

2205
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:39.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2206
01:08:39.651 --> 01:08:44.360
<v Speaker 3>it started back during the early time of the century when,</v>

2207
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:45.290
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2208
01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:47.540
<v Speaker 3>when cows were eating brewery brewery,</v>

2209
01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:49.430
<v Speaker 3>waste distiller's grains because they were,</v>

2210
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:50.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2211
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:51.170
<v Speaker 3>without refrigeration,</v>

2212
01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:53.260
<v Speaker 3>you put the,</v>

2213
01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:58.350
<v Speaker 3>they put the breweries and the cows together and in these urban sectors and you</v>

2214
01:08:58.771 --> 01:08:58.850
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2215
01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:01.340
<v Speaker 3>they didn't understand bacteria and hygiene and sanitation,</v>

2216
01:09:01.341 --> 01:09:01.970
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>

2217
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:05.180
<v Speaker 3>So the cows got a brucellosis and all these things,</v>

2218
01:09:05.181 --> 01:09:06.170
<v Speaker 3>pass it onto people.</v>

2219
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:12.130
<v Speaker 3>And Mayo clinic started putting cows back on pasture and feeding raw milk to</v>

2220
01:09:13.911 --> 01:09:18.230
<v Speaker 3>their patients during the time when people were getting sick from urban</v>

2221
01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:21.680
<v Speaker 3>industrial swill fed cow milk.</v>

2222
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:24.710
<v Speaker 3>And that's how Mayo Clinic actually started.</v>

2223
01:09:25.190 --> 01:09:27.700
<v Speaker 3>So that's a um,</v>

2224
01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:28.800
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2225
01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:29.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2226
01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:29.881
<v Speaker 3>raw milk is a,</v>

2227
01:09:29.881 --> 01:09:30.920
<v Speaker 3>is a wonderful,</v>

2228
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:31.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2229
01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:32.121
<v Speaker 3>material,</v>

2230
01:09:32.121 --> 01:09:34.820
<v Speaker 3>but the cow has to be treated like a cow,</v>

2231
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:35.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2232
01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:36.860
<v Speaker 3>you have to respect her countless as a cow.</v>

2233
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:38.570
<v Speaker 3>That's how I picked their countless.</v>

2234
01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.800
<v Speaker 3>That's how,</v>

2235
01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:40.663
<v Speaker 3>that's how you get.</v>

2236
01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:41.301
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>

2237
01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:44.330
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to all the milkiness of milk if you don't respect the counters of</v>

2238
01:09:44.331 --> 01:09:45.040
<v Speaker 3>the cow.</v>

2239
01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:45.710
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2240
01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:50.710
<v Speaker 3>And so what's happened is that the industry is so filthy and pathogen and toxic</v>

2241
01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:52.850
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2242
01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:53.683
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2243
01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2244
01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:58.700
<v Speaker 3>and people fear food because they're,</v>

2245
01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:00.470
<v Speaker 3>the average person is fearful of food.</v>

2246
01:10:00.471 --> 01:10:04.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean the average person is far more informed about the latest dysfunction and</v>

2247
01:10:04.931 --> 01:10:06.590
<v Speaker 3>the carnation household than they are,</v>

2248
01:10:06.591 --> 01:10:07.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2249
01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:07.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2250
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:10.430
<v Speaker 3>what's going to become flesh with their flesh and bone of their bones at 6:00.</v>

2251
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.340
<v Speaker 3>I liked how you pronounced it card.</v>

2252
01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:15.380
<v Speaker 3>It shows you really don't</v>

2253
01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.540
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

2254
01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:18.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2255
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:19.700
<v Speaker 3>So whatever they are,</v>

2256
01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:21.650
<v Speaker 3>whoever they are exactly.</v>

2257
01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:25.130
<v Speaker 3>Still asking though,</v>

2258
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.823
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

2259
01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:28.731
<v Speaker 3>it's all about.</v>

2260
01:10:28.731 --> 01:10:30.300
<v Speaker 3>So you need to put a button on TV.</v>

2261
01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:31.163
<v Speaker 3>People Watch.</v>

2262
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:33.650
<v Speaker 3>So the point is though,</v>

2263
01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.700
<v Speaker 3>that people are so paranoid of food and ignorant about food,</v>

2264
01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:39.020
<v Speaker 3>that they fear food today.</v>

2265
01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:39.410
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>

2266
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:44.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean we have customers call us up if I thought chicken in a sink.</v>

2267
01:10:44.281 --> 01:10:45.380
<v Speaker 3>Well it gets Salmonella.</v>

2268
01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:45.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2269
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:46.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a.</v>

2270
01:10:47.170 --> 01:10:52.170
<v Speaker 3>If there's a profound ignorance in our culture regarding food because we're</v>

2271
01:10:52.731 --> 01:10:53.750
<v Speaker 3>disconnected from it.</v>

2272
01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:57.890
<v Speaker 3>And so afraid people asked for security from the government.</v>

2273
01:10:57.891 --> 01:10:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Well the government says,</v>

2274
01:10:59.180 --> 01:10:59.421
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2275
01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.190
<v Speaker 3>let's see what should be our protocols.</v>

2276
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:06.340
<v Speaker 3>They go to the industry for the answers and concoct an orthodoxy that actually</v>

2277
01:11:08.301 --> 01:11:11.600
<v Speaker 3>shuts out the antidote for the very problems they're trying to solve.</v>

2278
01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:14.910
<v Speaker 3>The idea that the government would have any solutions whatsoever to that it's</v>

2279
01:11:14.911 --> 01:11:18.210
<v Speaker 3>pretty ridiculous in the first place because who would be the person that would</v>

2280
01:11:18.211 --> 01:11:19.980
<v Speaker 3>be an expert on this?</v>

2281
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.230
<v Speaker 3>Would it be the industry that,</v>

2282
01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:22.951
<v Speaker 3>that creates?</v>

2283
01:11:22.951 --> 01:11:27.450
<v Speaker 3>A lot of these problems we need is a guy like you working for the government.</v>

2284
01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:28.731
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2285
01:11:28.731 --> 01:11:32.610
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't work if I got chosen to work for the government.</v>

2286
01:11:32.611 --> 01:11:34.350
<v Speaker 3>Whatever agency I was in charge of,</v>

2287
01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:34.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2288
01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.470
<v Speaker 3>I'd shut it down before Sundance.</v>

2289
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:39.570
<v Speaker 3>What would you do if,</v>

2290
01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:40.600
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

2291
01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:45.600
<v Speaker 3>let's say there's some catastrophic failure of our government and they just</v>

2292
01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:49.650
<v Speaker 3>decided to quit and everybody just decided to go under and we need to figure out</v>

2293
01:11:49.651 --> 01:11:51.510
<v Speaker 3>how to regulate farms.</v>

2294
01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:52.523
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2295
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:52.920
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2296
01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:53.430
<v Speaker 3>what would,</v>

2297
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:54.270
<v Speaker 3>what could be done?</v>

2298
01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:55.440
<v Speaker 3>What can be done at this point?</v>

2299
01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:55.681
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2300
01:11:55.681 --> 01:11:55.821
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2301
01:11:55.821 --> 01:11:55.991
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2302
01:11:55.991 --> 01:11:58.810
<v Speaker 3>you suggesting that the factory farms there,</v>

2303
01:11:58.820 --> 01:11:59.110
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2304
01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:00.300
<v Speaker 3>there's no retrofit.</v>

2305
01:12:00.301 --> 01:12:04.090
<v Speaker 3>They shouldn't be destroyed and be better off building miniature golf courses</v>

2306
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.381
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>

2307
01:12:04.381 --> 01:12:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2308
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:10.100
<v Speaker 3>how would we be able to distribute food to a nation of hungry people?</v>

2309
01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:12.450
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible to use your methods,</v>

2310
01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:13.740
<v Speaker 3>the methods you use,</v>

2311
01:12:13.741 --> 01:12:15.540
<v Speaker 3>and how big is your farm in Virginia?</v>

2312
01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:15.871
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2313
01:12:15.871 --> 01:12:19.190
<v Speaker 3>we own 550 acres and we leased another nine farms.</v>

2314
01:12:19.191 --> 01:12:19.451
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>

2315
01:12:19.451 --> 01:12:21.120
<v Speaker 3>we're running 2000 acres.</v>

2316
01:12:21.490 --> 01:12:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2317
01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:22.230
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2318
01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:23.910
<v Speaker 3>and we're producing,</v>

2319
01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.500
<v Speaker 3>we're producing a lot of food.</v>

2320
01:12:25.501 --> 01:12:25.980
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2321
01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:26.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2322
01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:27.120
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2323
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.120
<v Speaker 3>we surpassed the county average in production on passenger by about threefold.</v>

2324
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:33.510
<v Speaker 3>A threefold amount,</v>

2325
01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:34.710
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty significant.</v>

2326
01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:37.770
<v Speaker 3>So factory farms given the same amount of space,</v>

2327
01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:38.760
<v Speaker 3>produce less.</v>

2328
01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:39.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2329
01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:40.351
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2330
01:12:40.351 --> 01:12:40.531
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2331
01:12:40.531 --> 01:12:43.110
<v Speaker 3>the thing that's important to realize when you look at a factory farm,</v>

2332
01:12:43.111 --> 01:12:46.680
<v Speaker 3>when the industry shows this picture of this big chicken house or this big,</v>

2333
01:12:46.681 --> 01:12:48.610
<v Speaker 3>big factory or hog or,</v>

2334
01:12:48.611 --> 01:12:48.841
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

2335
01:12:48.841 --> 01:12:49.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2336
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:50.093
<v Speaker 3>calfee lot,</v>

2337
01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:51.403
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2338
01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:51.961
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

2339
01:12:51.961 --> 01:12:52.201
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

2340
01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:52.291
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2341
01:12:52.291 --> 01:12:52.960
<v Speaker 3>or uh,</v>

2342
01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:53.200
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2343
01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:57.960
<v Speaker 3>know a square mile of strawberries in California.</v>

2344
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2345
01:12:58.950 --> 01:13:03.870
<v Speaker 3>what you have to understand is those systems are not standalone islands.</v>

2346
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:04.860
<v Speaker 3>When they say,</v>

2347
01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:07.200
<v Speaker 3>look at the efficiency of the small footprint,</v>

2348
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.840
<v Speaker 3>what they're not showing you are the square miles,</v>

2349
01:13:09.841 --> 01:13:10.674
<v Speaker 3>balls of,</v>

2350
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:14.720
<v Speaker 3>of subsidized grain or petroleum inputs.</v>

2351
01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.880
<v Speaker 3>The land area that all that takes to sustain that little footprint and then the</v>

2352
01:13:22.461 --> 01:13:27.230
<v Speaker 3>land that it takes to assimilate all of the waste stream from that.</v>

2353
01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.910
<v Speaker 3>So our system doesn't take one more,</v>

2354
01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:37.490
<v Speaker 3>one more square yard of production than,</v>

2355
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:39.230
<v Speaker 3>than the factory system.</v>

2356
01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:42.770
<v Speaker 3>The fact that we're doing,</v>

2357
01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:43.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2358
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2359
01:13:43.671 --> 01:13:44.301
<v Speaker 3>stackable,</v>

2360
01:13:44.301 --> 01:13:44.961
<v Speaker 3>synergistic,</v>

2361
01:13:44.961 --> 01:13:45.561
<v Speaker 3>symbiotic,</v>

2362
01:13:45.561 --> 01:13:48.080
<v Speaker 3>multi speciated enterprises,</v>

2363
01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.310
<v Speaker 3>it's more productive.</v>

2364
01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.270
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2365
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2366
01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.240
<v Speaker 3>but when you look at what we're producing,</v>

2367
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:56.090
<v Speaker 3>even though at first glance,</v>

2368
01:13:56.150 --> 01:13:57.470
<v Speaker 3>the uneducated might say,</v>

2369
01:13:57.471 --> 01:13:57.710
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2370
01:13:57.710 --> 01:13:59.840
<v Speaker 3>it takes a lot more land to produce them this way.</v>

2371
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:01.603
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

2372
01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.620
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing all the land.</v>

2373
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Just like when people say,</v>

2374
01:14:04.971 --> 01:14:05.121
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2375
01:14:05.121 --> 01:14:07.610
<v Speaker 3>it takes more people farming to do it your way.</v>

2376
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:08.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2377
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:09.223
<v Speaker 3>But you know what,</v>

2378
01:14:10.190 --> 01:14:12.970
<v Speaker 3>we don't have fixing pollution areas.</v>

2379
01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:16.260
<v Speaker 3>We don't have people burying people with C diff and,</v>

2380
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.581
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2381
01:14:16.581 --> 01:14:17.414
<v Speaker 3>and Murcia,</v>

2382
01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2383
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:18.910
<v Speaker 3>we don't know.</v>

2384
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:23.910
<v Speaker 3>We're not making people sick from Salmonella and e coli are you with.</v>

2385
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:24.873
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2386
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.570
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2387
01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:26.710
<v Speaker 3>so in toto,</v>

2388
01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:31.060
<v Speaker 3>all we're doing is taking all the people that are currently trying to,</v>

2389
01:14:31.410 --> 01:14:32.243
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2390
01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:37.000
<v Speaker 3>trying to triage the collateral damage of cheap food.</v>

2391
01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:41.140
<v Speaker 3>We're taking all those people and growing the food</v>

2392
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:48.570
<v Speaker 3>and all those jobs are coming back to the farm instead of being in,</v>

2393
01:14:50.370 --> 01:14:50.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2394
01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:55.710
<v Speaker 3>and whatever a costly remedial programs they are.</v>

2395
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:59.110
<v Speaker 3>So you are essentially a standalone system,</v>

2396
01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:01.180
<v Speaker 3>whereas when you're seeing a factory farm,</v>

2397
01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:01.970
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot.</v>

2398
01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely not seeing that's required to make that thing run.</v>

2399
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:05.531
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>

2400
01:15:05.531 --> 01:15:07.660
<v Speaker 3>Now we do buy grain for are omnivores,</v>

2401
01:15:07.661 --> 01:15:08.740
<v Speaker 3>but we buy local,</v>

2402
01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.420
<v Speaker 3>GMO free grain,</v>

2403
01:15:10.421 --> 01:15:11.980
<v Speaker 3>no genetically modified organisms.</v>

2404
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:13.280
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2405
01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:13.910
<v Speaker 3>and yes,</v>

2406
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:14.743
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2407
01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:15.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2408
01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.720
<v Speaker 3>the whole idea is to um,</v>

2409
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:21.090
<v Speaker 3>create a carbon centricity so that we're not you.</v>

2410
01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:24.550
<v Speaker 3>We're not shipping this stuff all over the place and when people say all but a</v>

2411
01:15:24.551 --> 01:15:25.930
<v Speaker 3>locality can't produce it.</v>

2412
01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:30.880
<v Speaker 3>Cornell did a fascinating study several years ago of New York.</v>

2413
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:32.620
<v Speaker 3>They took every metropolitan city,</v>

2414
01:15:32.621 --> 01:15:32.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2415
01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:33.341
<v Speaker 3>Ithaca,</v>

2416
01:15:33.341 --> 01:15:34.001
<v Speaker 3>Syracuse,</v>

2417
01:15:34.001 --> 01:15:34.834
<v Speaker 3>Buffalo,</v>

2418
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:35.823
<v Speaker 3>Albany,</v>

2419
01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:36.963
<v Speaker 3>New York City,</v>

2420
01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:39.400
<v Speaker 3>and he took all the cities of New York and said,</v>

2421
01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:44.290
<v Speaker 3>could we produce the calories for these urban sectors?</v>

2422
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:45.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2423
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:46.420
<v Speaker 3>how much land would it take?</v>

2424
01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:51.660
<v Speaker 3>And what they found was that every urban sector could produce all of its</v>

2425
01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.460
<v Speaker 3>calories within 30 miles.</v>

2426
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:57.100
<v Speaker 3>So even in New York,</v>

2427
01:15:57.130 --> 01:15:58.360
<v Speaker 3>it could be standalone,</v>

2428
01:15:58.370 --> 01:15:59.320
<v Speaker 3>self-sufficient,</v>

2429
01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.480
<v Speaker 3>except for New York City,</v>

2430
01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:05.620
<v Speaker 3>which if they went into New Jersey it became self sufficient as well because New</v>

2431
01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:06.453
<v Speaker 3>York's right on the edge of the,</v>

2432
01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:06.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2433
01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:07.720
<v Speaker 3>right on the edge of the state.</v>

2434
01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:13.860
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm so a fundamentally integrated system rather than a segregated system</v>

2435
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:18.170
<v Speaker 3>becomes far more efficient in,</v>

2436
01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:19.120
<v Speaker 3>in the scheme of things,</v>

2437
01:16:19.121 --> 01:16:22.870
<v Speaker 3>it comes far more efficient than a segregated system with all this,</v>

2438
01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:23.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2439
01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.980
<v Speaker 3>all this long distance transportation because the ships are passing in the</v>

2440
01:16:26.981 --> 01:16:27.280
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

2441
01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.180
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happening.</v>

2442
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:29.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2443
01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Iowa produces all this food.</v>

2444
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:36.390
<v Speaker 3>I will only eat only five percent of the food that's eaten in Iowa is grown in</v>

2445
01:16:36.461 --> 01:16:37.294
<v Speaker 3>Iowa</v>

2446
01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:42.220
<v Speaker 3>and Iowa is the most fertile piece of land in the,</v>

2447
01:16:42.221 --> 01:16:43.150
<v Speaker 3>in the planet.</v>

2448
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:44.620
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2449
01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:47.130
<v Speaker 3>Because they're there.</v>

2450
01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.490
<v Speaker 3>They're not producing food.</v>

2451
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.750
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to eat there.</v>

2452
01:16:50.010 --> 01:16:50.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2453
01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:51.023
<v Speaker 3>if you want to eat,</v>

2454
01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:51.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2455
01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.020
<v Speaker 3>berries and apples and things.</v>

2456
01:16:53.021 --> 01:16:56.020
<v Speaker 3>There has to be imported from somewhere else because the whole states and corn</v>

2457
01:16:56.021 --> 01:16:56.860
<v Speaker 3>and soybeans,</v>

2458
01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.500
<v Speaker 3>this gmo genetically modified things.</v>

2459
01:16:59.501 --> 01:17:00.760
<v Speaker 3>A real hot topic.</v>

2460
01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.950
<v Speaker 3>It is genetically modified.</v>

2461
01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:07.951
<v Speaker 3>Seems to me to be along the same lines of his factory farming idea is that</v>

2462
01:17:08.201 --> 01:17:08.401
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2463
01:17:08.401 --> 01:17:08.840
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2464
01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:11.870
<v Speaker 3>instead of looking at it in a comprehensive approach,</v>

2465
01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:13.220
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is saying,</v>

2466
01:17:13.221 --> 01:17:13.461
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2467
01:17:13.461 --> 01:17:14.271
<v Speaker 3>we got a problem.</v>

2468
01:17:14.271 --> 01:17:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Let's attack that problem with chemicals.</v>

2469
01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:16.941
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2470
01:17:16.941 --> 01:17:17.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2471
01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:17.440
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2472
01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.670
<v Speaker 3>it's fundamentally bridging.</v>

2473
01:17:19.730 --> 01:17:20.750
<v Speaker 3>It's fundamentally,</v>

2474
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:25.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm overrunning a lot of natural barriers that are there in place to protect,</v>

2475
01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.680
<v Speaker 3>to protect happening what is happening,</v>

2476
01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:35.690
<v Speaker 3>which is a,</v>

2477
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:36.863
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2478
01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:40.070
<v Speaker 3>a mishmash of genetic material.</v>

2479
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.951
<v Speaker 3>So you have a,</v>

2480
01:17:40.951 --> 01:17:41.271
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2481
01:17:41.271 --> 01:17:43.190
<v Speaker 3>a salmon that's partly a pepper plant,</v>

2482
01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:43.581
<v Speaker 3>partly,</v>

2483
01:17:43.581 --> 01:17:43.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2484
01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:44.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2485
01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:46.970
<v Speaker 3>a tropical urban park pig.</v>

2486
01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:47.923
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2487
01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:48.411
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2488
01:17:48.411 --> 01:17:49.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2489
01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:49.320
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2490
01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.153
<v Speaker 3>and you talk about,</v>

2491
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:52.760
<v Speaker 3>you mentioned allergies a little bit in the past,</v>

2492
01:17:53.050 --> 01:17:53.480
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2493
01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:54.313
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2494
01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:55.790
<v Speaker 3>when we were kids,</v>

2495
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:58.550
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know anybody with a food allergy.</v>

2496
01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.080
<v Speaker 3>We didn't even know the phrase,</v>

2497
01:18:00.081 --> 01:18:01.670
<v Speaker 3>I never even heard the phrase,</v>

2498
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:02.630
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2499
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:04.760
<v Speaker 3>And now it's ubiquitous.</v>

2500
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:08.600
<v Speaker 3>What's happening is that we're getting all of this,</v>

2501
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:09.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2502
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:10.300
<v Speaker 3>this Frankenfood,</v>

2503
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:11.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2504
01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:11.900
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2505
01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:12.290
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2506
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:14.330
<v Speaker 3>it's our,</v>

2507
01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:16.250
<v Speaker 3>our internal bacteria.</v>

2508
01:18:16.251 --> 01:18:16.461
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2509
01:18:16.461 --> 01:18:21.461
<v Speaker 3>we've got 3 trillion beings and our insides and they're not capable of mutating.</v>

2510
01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:29.920
<v Speaker 3>And I'm assimilating material as fast as our human brains can adulterate the</v>

2511
01:18:32.511 --> 01:18:33.344
<v Speaker 3>food system.</v>

2512
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:39.010
<v Speaker 3>And so what happens is we're sending down there a bunch of foreign material.</v>

2513
01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:41.091
<v Speaker 3>What's this?</v>

2514
01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:41.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2515
01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:42.680
<v Speaker 3>I can just see him talking to,</v>

2516
01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:44.470
<v Speaker 3>let's have a board meeting here and see what that,</v>

2517
01:18:44.530 --> 01:18:45.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2518
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:46.340
<v Speaker 3>gmo corn is.</v>

2519
01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.930
<v Speaker 3>And so what happens is,</v>

2520
01:18:47.931 --> 01:18:48.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2521
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.100
<v Speaker 3>they can't assimilate it.</v>

2522
01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:54.940
<v Speaker 3>And so the other thing about gmos is that it is hard to contain,</v>

2523
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:56.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2524
01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.980
<v Speaker 3>by nature it's promiscuous.</v>

2525
01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:02.690
<v Speaker 3>So what you have here is a new life form.</v>

2526
01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:03.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2527
01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:04.560
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that,</v>

2528
01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:08.420
<v Speaker 3>that people have been able to do before now is a mule.</v>

2529
01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:09.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2530
01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:10.760
<v Speaker 3>it's a donkey on a horse.</v>

2531
01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.013
<v Speaker 3>Makes a mule.</v>

2532
01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:15.410
<v Speaker 3>But a mule is sterile.</v>

2533
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:16.640
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like God says,</v>

2534
01:19:16.641 --> 01:19:17.300
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2535
01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.200
<v Speaker 3>you can do that,</v>

2536
01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:18.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2537
01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:19.550
<v Speaker 3>donkey on horse.</v>

2538
01:19:19.670 --> 01:19:20.300
<v Speaker 3>But that's it.</v>

2539
01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:20.501
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2540
01:19:20.501 --> 01:19:21.830
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to go anymore than that.</v>

2541
01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:24.440
<v Speaker 3>This is not Mendel's peas.</v>

2542
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:26.240
<v Speaker 3>Mendel was peas on peace.</v>

2543
01:19:26.241 --> 01:19:27.860
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't pees on tomatoes,</v>

2544
01:19:27.861 --> 01:19:28.341
<v Speaker 3>on pigs,</v>

2545
01:19:28.341 --> 01:19:29.174
<v Speaker 3>on monkeys,</v>

2546
01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:29.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2547
01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:30.170
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2548
01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:31.880
<v Speaker 3>it was within specie.</v>

2549
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:34.340
<v Speaker 3>And so this is a,</v>

2550
01:19:34.690 --> 01:19:35.523
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2551
01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.473
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2552
01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:36.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2553
01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:41.940
<v Speaker 3>this is an assault on the sexual plumbing that nature has to maintain genetic</v>

2554
01:19:45.561 --> 01:19:50.561
<v Speaker 3>purity and it seems like the DDT issue hasn't been factored in as far as the</v>

2555
01:19:51.441 --> 01:19:52.274
<v Speaker 3>longterm,</v>

2556
01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.313
<v Speaker 3>if that price.</v>

2557
01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:53.811
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2558
01:19:53.811 --> 01:19:54.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2559
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:55.310
<v Speaker 3>The feeding trials,</v>

2560
01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:57.530
<v Speaker 3>all the feeding trials have only been like,</v>

2561
01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:57.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2562
01:19:57.770 --> 01:19:58.550
<v Speaker 3>60 days,</v>

2563
01:19:58.550 --> 01:20:00.710
<v Speaker 3>60 days is nothing.</v>

2564
01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

2565
01:20:01.821 --> 01:20:02.870
<v Speaker 3>but if you know the,</v>

2566
01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:07.310
<v Speaker 3>probably the world expert on this as Jeffrey Smith who wrote seeds of deception</v>

2567
01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:08.640
<v Speaker 3>and is the,</v>

2568
01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:08.830
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2569
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:10.860
<v Speaker 3>the premier world GMO expert.</v>

2570
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:12.600
<v Speaker 3>He points out that when,</v>

2571
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2572
01:20:13.261 --> 01:20:16.410
<v Speaker 3>when Monsanto was doing feeding trials for FDA on,</v>

2573
01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:16.831
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2574
01:20:16.831 --> 01:20:17.664
<v Speaker 3>potatoes,</v>

2575
01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.361
<v Speaker 3>a GMO,</v>

2576
01:20:18.361 --> 01:20:23.010
<v Speaker 3>potatoes they chose for the feeding trial,</v>

2577
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:24.420
<v Speaker 3>geriatric rats.</v>

2578
01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:25.171
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2579
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:27.570
<v Speaker 3>geriatric rats are already completely form.</v>

2580
01:20:27.571 --> 01:20:27.691
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2581
01:20:27.691 --> 01:20:31.080
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to see any big changes in those in Scotland.</v>

2582
01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:32.760
<v Speaker 3>When the,</v>

2583
01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:33.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2584
01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:33.721
<v Speaker 3>scientists,</v>

2585
01:20:33.721 --> 01:20:37.770
<v Speaker 3>they're duplicated those studies with juvenile rats,</v>

2586
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:39.980
<v Speaker 3>same feeding trial,</v>

2587
01:20:39.981 --> 01:20:40.830
<v Speaker 3>same potatoes,</v>

2588
01:20:40.831 --> 01:20:41.910
<v Speaker 3>same everything,</v>

2589
01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:45.630
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of problems develop cognitive ability,</v>

2590
01:20:45.631 --> 01:20:46.440
<v Speaker 3>brain fog.</v>

2591
01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.730
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't go through a maze,</v>

2592
01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:49.980
<v Speaker 3>a organ development,</v>

2593
01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:51.270
<v Speaker 3>kidney malfunction,</v>

2594
01:20:51.650 --> 01:20:54.210
<v Speaker 3>a fertility problems.</v>

2595
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2596
01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:55.380
<v Speaker 3>you name it.</v>

2597
01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:56.520
<v Speaker 3>I had all these problems.</v>

2598
01:20:56.970 --> 01:20:57.803
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2599
01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2600
01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.040
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>

2601
01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:02.580
<v Speaker 3>one of the problems with science is that it's very subjective.</v>

2602
01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:07.260
<v Speaker 3>You can set up an experiment within your paradigm.</v>

2603
01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:07.591
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2604
01:21:07.591 --> 01:21:09.090
<v Speaker 3>Teddy Roosevelt used to say,</v>

2605
01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:10.650
<v Speaker 3>it's really hard to see,</v>

2606
01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:15.140
<v Speaker 3>it's really hard to get a guy to see something when his paycheck believes a</v>

2607
01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:18.230
<v Speaker 3>depends on seeing something else as a good way of putting it.</v>

2608
01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:21.030
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's exactly what's happened here,</v>

2609
01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:25.400
<v Speaker 3>that you can set up experiments and,</v>

2610
01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:27.390
<v Speaker 3>and constrict the parameters,</v>

2611
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.280
<v Speaker 3>whether it's length of time,</v>

2612
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:30.480
<v Speaker 3>type of subject,</v>

2613
01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:31.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2614
01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:31.913
<v Speaker 3>you name it,</v>

2615
01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.010
<v Speaker 3>but you can set up the parameters of the experiment</v>

2616
01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.040
<v Speaker 3>to skew the results,</v>

2617
01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:42.540
<v Speaker 3>to not get a comprehensive eclectic view like the geriatric read,</v>

2618
01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:43.670
<v Speaker 3>like the geriatric rats.</v>

2619
01:21:43.671 --> 01:21:45.120
<v Speaker 3>And that seems like dirty pool.</v>

2620
01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:45.990
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2621
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:47.560
<v Speaker 3>that's a bad thing that they do.</v>

2622
01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:48.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2623
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.841
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

2624
01:21:49.841 --> 01:21:51.030
<v Speaker 3>In doing this just for profit.</v>

2625
01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:52.470
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2626
01:21:52.471 --> 01:21:53.071
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

2627
01:21:53.071 --> 01:21:54.450
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of money on the line,</v>

2628
01:21:54.570 --> 01:21:55.980
<v Speaker 3>a lot of money on the line.</v>

2629
01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:56.150
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2630
01:21:56.150 --> 01:21:56.983
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2631
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.823
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

2632
01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:00.421
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2633
01:22:00.421 --> 01:22:00.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2634
01:22:00.661 --> 01:22:00.800
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2635
01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.490
<v Speaker 3>so where are we going to go from here?</v>

2636
01:22:02.491 --> 01:22:04.020
<v Speaker 3>How do we go from here?</v>

2637
01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:04.711
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2638
01:22:04.711 --> 01:22:04.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2639
01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:05.401
<v Speaker 3>when you ask,</v>

2640
01:22:05.401 --> 01:22:05.491
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2641
01:22:05.491 --> 01:22:06.121
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2642
01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:07.650
<v Speaker 3>what could you do?</v>

2643
01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:09.180
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2644
01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:10.770
<v Speaker 3>we know this system is bad,</v>

2645
01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:11.580
<v Speaker 3>how do we,</v>

2646
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:13.860
<v Speaker 3>how do we really move over here?</v>

2647
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:15.143
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

2648
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.580
<v Speaker 3>there are several answers.</v>

2649
01:22:17.581 --> 01:22:17.821
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2650
01:22:17.821 --> 01:22:18.450
<v Speaker 3>one is,</v>

2651
01:22:18.450 --> 01:22:18.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2652
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:19.740
<v Speaker 3>go underground,</v>

2653
01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:20.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2654
01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:21.810
<v Speaker 3>just start buying the good stuff.</v>

2655
01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:25.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm guerrilla type marketing,</v>

2656
01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:28.680
<v Speaker 3>but I think the main one is the,</v>

2657
01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:32.760
<v Speaker 3>what we need is a food emancipation proclamation.</v>

2658
01:22:33.650 --> 01:22:37.620
<v Speaker 3>We need a food emancipation proclamation to free the food system from the</v>

2659
01:22:37.621 --> 01:22:40.980
<v Speaker 3>enslavement of bureaucratic orthodoxy</v>

2660
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.700
<v Speaker 3>so that consenting adults,</v>

2661
01:22:44.701 --> 01:22:49.701
<v Speaker 3>and I'm choosing my words very carefully here so that consenting adults could</v>

2662
01:22:49.891 --> 01:22:54.000
<v Speaker 3>make a voluntary choice of food choice,</v>

2663
01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:58.500
<v Speaker 3>the type that they want from the source that they want.</v>

2664
01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:03.990
<v Speaker 3>And if we allowed however many in our society,</v>

2665
01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.140
<v Speaker 3>five percent,</v>

2666
01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:05.741
<v Speaker 3>10 percent,</v>

2667
01:23:05.741 --> 01:23:06.574
<v Speaker 3>20 percent,</v>

2668
01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:09.670
<v Speaker 3>who ever didn't,</v>

2669
01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:15.420
<v Speaker 3>can whoever wanted to opt out of government sanctioned orthodoxy and say,</v>

2670
01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:17.733
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>

2671
01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:19.900
<v Speaker 3>is there something better out here?</v>

2672
01:23:20.410 --> 01:23:21.850
<v Speaker 3>Can I choose something different?</v>

2673
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:27.330
<v Speaker 3>If anybody who wanted to opt out of the of the current industrial government</v>

2674
01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:30.820
<v Speaker 3>orthodoxy could do so,</v>

2675
01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:34.660
<v Speaker 3>no voluntary consenting adults here.</v>

2676
01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:35.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2677
01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:38.470
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about the right of private contract.</v>

2678
01:23:38.471 --> 01:23:39.220
<v Speaker 3>If I want to,</v>

2679
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.230
<v Speaker 3>if I want to come to your farm voluntarily,</v>

2680
01:23:41.231 --> 01:23:42.310
<v Speaker 3>no extortion here,</v>

2681
01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:43.173
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>

2682
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:44.980
<v Speaker 3>Voluntarily look around,</v>

2683
01:23:44.981 --> 01:23:45.641
<v Speaker 3>smell around,</v>

2684
01:23:45.641 --> 01:23:48.520
<v Speaker 3>ask around and I want what you're producing.</v>

2685
01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:50.710
<v Speaker 3>I should be able to get it.</v>

2686
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:53.830
<v Speaker 3>When the government gets between my lips and my throat,</v>

2687
01:23:53.831 --> 01:23:57.160
<v Speaker 3>I call that an invasion of privacy and yes,</v>

2688
01:23:57.161 --> 01:24:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I do also believe that we should legalize all drugs,</v>

2689
01:24:01.630 --> 01:24:02.463
<v Speaker 3>all of them,</v>

2690
01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:06.880
<v Speaker 3>because the government that can tell you you can't smoke dope can also tell you</v>

2691
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:08.860
<v Speaker 3>can't drink raw milk or,</v>

2692
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:09.460
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

2693
01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:09.850
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

2694
01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:12.670
<v Speaker 3>or refuse to vaccinate your children or you know,</v>

2695
01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:13.600
<v Speaker 3>go down the line.</v>

2696
01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:19.290
<v Speaker 3>The fact is that the orthodoxy is so convoluted now that it's perfectly safe and</v>

2697
01:24:23.051 --> 01:24:25.150
<v Speaker 3>fine to feed your kids Coca Cola,</v>

2698
01:24:25.151 --> 01:24:26.800
<v Speaker 3>mountain dew count Chocula,</v>

2699
01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:29.020
<v Speaker 3>cheerio's and pop tarts,</v>

2700
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:34.000
<v Speaker 3>but not homemade charcuterie.</v>

2701
01:24:34.510 --> 01:24:35.343
<v Speaker 3>Pickles,</v>

2702
01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.890
<v Speaker 3>raw milk and backyard butcher chickens.</v>

2703
01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Not Crazy.</v>

2704
01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:41.590
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely crazy.</v>

2705
01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:43.120
<v Speaker 3>And if we would free up,</v>

2706
01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:44.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2707
01:24:44.050 --> 01:24:44.740
<v Speaker 3>I travel a lot.</v>

2708
01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:47.200
<v Speaker 3>I talked to thousands and thousands of farmers.</v>

2709
01:24:47.201 --> 01:24:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I just talked to 200 farmers up in San Jose this weekend.</v>

2710
01:24:50.650 --> 01:24:51.483
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2711
01:24:51.570 --> 01:24:53.710
<v Speaker 3>and what's the limiting factor?</v>

2712
01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Why is local food cheap?</v>

2713
01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Why is our kind of food,</v>

2714
01:24:57.150 --> 01:24:57.983
<v Speaker 3>I mean cheap,</v>

2715
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.250
<v Speaker 3>more expensive than it has to be.</v>

2716
01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:02.530
<v Speaker 3>Why are we perceived as elitist?</v>

2717
01:25:02.710 --> 01:25:04.180
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't it more available?</v>

2718
01:25:04.181 --> 01:25:06.760
<v Speaker 3>Why is it so hard to find integrity food?</v>

2719
01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.260
<v Speaker 3>This is the issue.</v>

2720
01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:13.560
<v Speaker 3>And if we would free up those of us in the system that are ready to access our</v>

2721
01:25:16.541 --> 01:25:21.370
<v Speaker 3>neighbors with quiche and noodles and charcuterie and you know,</v>

2722
01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.211
<v Speaker 3>a name,</v>

2723
01:25:22.211 --> 01:25:24.910
<v Speaker 3>your name it to free us up,</v>

2724
01:25:25.930 --> 01:25:26.763
<v Speaker 3>it would,</v>

2725
01:25:26.890 --> 01:25:31.890
<v Speaker 3>it would completely invert the entire food system in a year.</v>

2726
01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:36.150
<v Speaker 4>The entire food system as you speak of like when you're talking about the</v>

2727
01:25:36.151 --> 01:25:39.960
<v Speaker 4>genetically modified organisms and you're talking about these companies that</v>

2728
01:25:39.961 --> 01:25:41.880
<v Speaker 4>provide them like Monsanto.</v>

2729
01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:45.750
<v Speaker 4>There's a backlash against that now because of the information that's been</v>

2730
01:25:45.751 --> 01:25:48.180
<v Speaker 4>released about the detrimental effects of them.</v>

2731
01:25:48.181 --> 01:25:50.250
<v Speaker 4>And you're seeing like in Brazil,</v>

2732
01:25:50.251 --> 01:25:51.420
<v Speaker 4>they won lawsuits,</v>

2733
01:25:51.421 --> 01:25:55.230
<v Speaker 4>a farmers one massive lawsuits against Monsanto and these,</v>

2734
01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.113
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2735
01:25:56.910 --> 01:26:00.180
<v Speaker 4>various GMO products that they've created.</v>

2736
01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:05.120
<v Speaker 4>Say what you're talking about Iowa and the fertility of the land in Iowa.</v>

2737
01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:06.110
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

2738
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:06.980
<v Speaker 4>what could,</v>

2739
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:09.290
<v Speaker 4>what could possibly happen?</v>

2740
01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:14.320
<v Speaker 4>How could those all these farms that are set up to just specifically grow grains</v>

2741
01:26:14.691 --> 01:26:19.691
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of them grains that are specifically grown just to feed livestock or</v>

2742
01:26:19.761 --> 01:26:20.630
<v Speaker 4>make alcohol,</v>

2743
01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:22.000
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2744
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.060
<v Speaker 4>is that what it is to like?</v>

2745
01:26:23.090 --> 01:26:23.211
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2746
01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:23.371
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2747
01:26:23.371 --> 01:26:23.770
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

2748
01:26:23.770 --> 01:26:24.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2749
01:26:24.110 --> 01:26:25.250
<v Speaker 4>all the alcohol,</v>

2750
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:26.210
<v Speaker 4>corn,</v>

2751
01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:26.451
<v Speaker 4>corn,</v>

2752
01:26:26.451 --> 01:26:26.900
<v Speaker 4>alcohol,</v>

2753
01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:27.560
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm,</v>

2754
01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:28.780
<v Speaker 4>most of the farms,</v>

2755
01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:29.850
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it already.</v>

2756
01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:34.370
<v Speaker 4>But go ahead with the massive amounts of Ronnie are invested in these systems.</v>

2757
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:35.720
<v Speaker 4>What could they do?</v>

2758
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2759
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:37.940
<v Speaker 4>what could be done to change all that?</v>

2760
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:42.800
<v Speaker 4>Could those farms be sort of turned around and brought to a more of a</v>

2761
01:26:43.150 --> 01:26:45.080
<v Speaker 4>comprehensive approach to farming?</v>

2762
01:26:45.081 --> 01:26:47.210
<v Speaker 4>Like you're prescribing what the deliveries</v>

2763
01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:49.080
<v Speaker 3>stables do when the automobile came?</v>

2764
01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:52.560
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're talking about here.</v>

2765
01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.020
<v Speaker 3>Think about that transition.</v>

2766
01:26:55.170 --> 01:26:56.003
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2767
01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:56.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2768
01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:59.850
<v Speaker 3>think about the horse drawn Hackney's when the electric streetcar came.</v>

2769
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:01.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2770
01:27:01.530 --> 01:27:02.700
<v Speaker 3>you're talking that,</v>

2771
01:27:02.730 --> 01:27:04.770
<v Speaker 3>that's the level of change here.</v>

2772
01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:10.050
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about massive societal change.</v>

2773
01:27:10.530 --> 01:27:11.820
<v Speaker 3>There'll be some losers,</v>

2774
01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.470
<v Speaker 3>but you know what?</v>

2775
01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:18.540
<v Speaker 3>Those guys have been making fun of me and calling me a bio terrorist and a</v>

2776
01:27:18.541 --> 01:27:19.321
<v Speaker 3>lunatic and a,</v>

2777
01:27:19.321 --> 01:27:19.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2778
01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:20.613
<v Speaker 3>a</v>

2779
01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:26.700
<v Speaker 3>terrorist because our chickens can commune with redwing blackbirds and Indigo</v>

2780
01:27:27.241 --> 01:27:28.620
<v Speaker 3>buntings out in the field,</v>

2781
01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:32.730
<v Speaker 3>and then those wild birds take our diseases to the science based environmentally</v>

2782
01:27:32.731 --> 01:27:37.380
<v Speaker 3>controlled factory chicken houses and threatened the planet's food supply all</v>

2783
01:27:37.381 --> 01:27:42.381
<v Speaker 3>because we were so archaic and Neanderthal that we had our chickens running</v>

2784
01:27:44.071 --> 01:27:44.910
<v Speaker 3>around in the pasture.</v>

2785
01:27:45.150 --> 01:27:46.530
<v Speaker 3>Has that really been argued?</v>

2786
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:47.101
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2787
01:27:47.101 --> 01:27:48.090
<v Speaker 3>You've really had that.</v>

2788
01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:49.170
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2789
01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:50.550
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

2790
01:27:50.670 --> 01:27:50.980
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2791
01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:51.840
<v Speaker 3>barbarian,</v>

2792
01:27:51.841 --> 01:27:53.550
<v Speaker 3>you let your chickens run loose?</v>

2793
01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:54.121
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2794
01:27:54.121 --> 01:27:54.571
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2795
01:27:54.571 --> 01:27:58.290
<v Speaker 3>I had two federal veterinarians when the last time we had an avian flu outbreak</v>

2796
01:27:58.291 --> 01:27:58.451
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2797
01:27:58.451 --> 01:27:58.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2798
01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:01.050
<v Speaker 3>in Virginia back about 12 years ago.</v>

2799
01:28:01.410 --> 01:28:02.070
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2800
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.510
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

2801
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.851
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

2802
01:28:02.851 --> 01:28:03.684
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2803
01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:08.780
<v Speaker 3>they exterminated landfilled 1000 tractor trailer loads of port,</v>

2804
01:28:09.090 --> 01:28:09.350
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2805
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:10.350
<v Speaker 3>of a poultry,</v>

2806
01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:15.440
<v Speaker 3>1000 tractor trailer loads of poultry within just about a five county area of</v>

2807
01:28:15.841 --> 01:28:16.130
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2808
01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:16.640
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2809
01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:17.030
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>

2810
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:20.300
<v Speaker 4>Did they then in turn feed that poultry back to other chickens</v>

2811
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:22.140
<v Speaker 3>after they killed him?</v>

2812
01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:22.501
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2813
01:28:22.501 --> 01:28:22.861
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2814
01:28:22.861 --> 01:28:24.780
<v Speaker 3>that was not because that was avian flu.</v>

2815
01:28:24.781 --> 01:28:25.141
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

2816
01:28:25.141 --> 01:28:27.060
<v Speaker 3>they actually landfilled or incinerated,</v>

2817
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.540
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

2818
01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:28.373
<v Speaker 3>Burned it up.</v>

2819
01:28:28.650 --> 01:28:29.041
<v Speaker 3>But see,</v>

2820
01:28:29.041 --> 01:28:31.680
<v Speaker 3>under our system you don't have any of that stuff.</v>

2821
01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:32.873
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

2822
01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.950
<v Speaker 3>a thousand tractor trailer loads is a lot of food.</v>

2823
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:35.580
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2824
01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:36.180
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

2825
01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I had two vets there that were part of the extermination of federal tax force.</v>

2826
01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:43.890
<v Speaker 3>Both of them said that,</v>

2827
01:28:44.010 --> 01:28:44.843
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2828
01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:46.950
<v Speaker 3>that we are considered,</v>

2829
01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:47.221
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2830
01:28:47.221 --> 01:28:48.054
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2831
01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:49.920
<v Speaker 3>they came to visit because they'd read about us,</v>

2832
01:28:50.150 --> 01:28:50.520
<v Speaker 3>oh we're,</v>

2833
01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:50.971
<v Speaker 3>we're here,</v>

2834
01:28:50.971 --> 01:28:51.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2835
01:28:51.211 --> 01:28:52.410
<v Speaker 3>they came from Oklahoma,</v>

2836
01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:53.250
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2837
01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:54.270
<v Speaker 3>We'll go see this place.</v>

2838
01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:59.460
<v Speaker 3>And both of them said that we are considered a typhoid Mary in the,</v>

2839
01:28:59.610 --> 01:29:01.310
<v Speaker 3>in the community B,</v>

2840
01:29:01.570 --> 01:29:01.890
<v Speaker 3>b,</v>

2841
01:29:01.890 --> 01:29:02.670
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

2842
01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:02.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2843
01:29:02.911 --> 01:29:03.240
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>

2844
01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.200
<v Speaker 3>we don't vaccinate,</v>

2845
01:29:04.201 --> 01:29:06.000
<v Speaker 3>we don't medicate and we don't,</v>

2846
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:07.103
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2847
01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:07.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2848
01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:11.520
<v Speaker 3>we don't do all the orthodoxy that the industry says you're supposed to do.</v>

2849
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:12.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2850
01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:13.380
<v Speaker 3>that's the orthodoxy.</v>

2851
01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:14.480
<v Speaker 3>See that's the.</v>

2852
01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.390
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't,</v>

2853
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.160
<v Speaker 3>if you don't adhere to that,</v>

2854
01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.310
<v Speaker 3>and of course that then that orthodoxy drives insurance.</v>

2855
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:22.170
<v Speaker 3>How does the farmer sells product?</v>

2856
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:24.240
<v Speaker 3>How does he get product liability insurance?</v>

2857
01:29:24.570 --> 01:29:26.460
<v Speaker 3>The insurance company says,</v>

2858
01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:27.391
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2859
01:29:27.391 --> 01:29:30.750
<v Speaker 3>we won't underwrite you unless you use best agricultural practices.</v>

2860
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:33.120
<v Speaker 3>Will the insurance company doesn't know anything about agriculture,</v>

2861
01:29:33.121 --> 01:29:36.440
<v Speaker 3>where are they going to find out about what's best agricultural practices that</v>

2862
01:29:36.441 --> 01:29:37.170
<v Speaker 3>Dang,</v>

2863
01:29:37.170 --> 01:29:39.300
<v Speaker 3>they ring up the land grant university,</v>

2864
01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:41.760
<v Speaker 3>which is the lackey of the industry,</v>

2865
01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:42.990
<v Speaker 3>and they say,</v>

2866
01:29:42.991 --> 01:29:43.171
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2867
01:29:43.171 --> 01:29:45.300
<v Speaker 3>you need this protocol of vaccinations,</v>

2868
01:29:45.301 --> 01:29:47.010
<v Speaker 3>this protocol of medications,</v>

2869
01:29:47.011 --> 01:29:48.270
<v Speaker 3>this protocol of chlorine,</v>

2870
01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:49.253
<v Speaker 3>this protocol,</v>

2871
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:50.760
<v Speaker 3>and if the farm doesn't do that,</v>

2872
01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.110
<v Speaker 3>it's high risk.</v>

2873
01:29:52.290 --> 01:29:53.180
<v Speaker 3>It's high risk form.</v>

2874
01:29:53.210 --> 01:29:54.000
<v Speaker 3>You better not do it.</v>

2875
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:59.000
<v Speaker 3>And so right now a lot of farmers like us are unable to get insurance because</v>

2876
01:30:00.751 --> 01:30:04.110
<v Speaker 3>the underwriters won't insure risky farming,</v>

2877
01:30:04.290 --> 01:30:05.123
<v Speaker 3>which</v>

2878
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:07.170
<v Speaker 3>is which,</v>

2879
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:11.340
<v Speaker 3>which goes against the orthodoxy of the system because the insurance executives</v>

2880
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:12.660
<v Speaker 3>played golf with the,</v>

2881
01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:13.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2882
01:30:13.081 --> 01:30:13.441
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2883
01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:13.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2884
01:30:13.890 --> 01:30:17.090
<v Speaker 3>the industrial ag executives play golf with the bureaucracy,</v>

2885
01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:17.841
<v Speaker 3>the bureaucracy,</v>

2886
01:30:17.841 --> 01:30:18.570
<v Speaker 3>executives.</v>

2887
01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:19.800
<v Speaker 3>It's all a big fraternity.</v>

2888
01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.540
<v Speaker 3>It's not a conspiracy.</v>

2889
01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:25.200
<v Speaker 3>It's a fraternity of ideas and they've all drunk the Koolaid.</v>

2890
01:30:25.810 --> 01:30:30.810
<v Speaker 3>Dad is madness and it's incredibly frustrating because you're so transparent</v>

2891
01:30:31.411 --> 01:30:35.970
<v Speaker 3>about your process and the benefits of your process when you're sitting out</v>

2892
01:30:35.971 --> 01:30:36.391
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2893
01:30:36.391 --> 01:30:39.900
<v Speaker 3>In one of the videos that I watched you sitting out there with these pigs,</v>

2894
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.880
<v Speaker 3>these pigs are just hanging out there.</v>

2895
01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:45.770
<v Speaker 3>They come up to you like the pig got under your arm and your leg,</v>

2896
01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:46.680
<v Speaker 3>put your arm on him.</v>

2897
01:30:46.681 --> 01:30:46.921
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2898
01:30:46.921 --> 01:30:47.131
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2899
01:30:47.131 --> 01:30:47.690
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>

2900
01:30:47.690 --> 01:30:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2901
01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:48.480
<v Speaker 3>You know when the.</v>

2902
01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:50.040
<v Speaker 3>They just rooting around and,</v>

2903
01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.450
<v Speaker 3>and anybody that wouldn't see the benefits of that,</v>

2904
01:30:54.451 --> 01:30:56.160
<v Speaker 3>you have to be either.</v>

2905
01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:59.490
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a financial vested interest in not seeing it.</v>

2906
01:30:59.670 --> 01:30:59.791
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2907
01:30:59.791 --> 01:31:00.810
<v Speaker 3>you have to be insane.</v>

2908
01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:01.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2909
01:31:01.410 --> 01:31:01.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2910
01:31:01.561 --> 01:31:03.040
<v Speaker 3>You have to be in say a.</v>

2911
01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:05.480
<v Speaker 3>The best compliment I ever got was a young chef.</v>

2912
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Young chef came eight,</v>

2913
01:31:06.401 --> 01:31:07.111
<v Speaker 3>wanted to see the farm.</v>

2914
01:31:07.111 --> 01:31:09.180
<v Speaker 3>You starting to buy our stuff and really liked it.</v>

2915
01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:10.920
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to come and see the pics.</v>

2916
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:11.970
<v Speaker 3>I took him up to the pigs.</v>

2917
01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:13.013
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2918
01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:13.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2919
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:13.730
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2920
01:31:13.730 --> 01:31:14.491
<v Speaker 3>it was a young guy.</v>

2921
01:31:14.491 --> 01:31:15.030
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2922
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.960
<v Speaker 3>I have never.</v>

2923
01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:17.670
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a live pig.</v>

2924
01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:18.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2925
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:18.741
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2926
01:31:18.741 --> 01:31:19.050
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2927
01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:20.610
<v Speaker 3>he cuts them up and cook them all the time,</v>

2928
01:31:20.611 --> 01:31:24.330
<v Speaker 3>but he never been physically present with a live pig and he just got really</v>

2929
01:31:24.331 --> 01:31:24.661
<v Speaker 3>quiet.</v>

2930
01:31:24.661 --> 01:31:25.171
<v Speaker 3>I just let him,</v>

2931
01:31:25.171 --> 01:31:25.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2932
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:29.730
<v Speaker 3>enjoy it for a little while and the pigs were knowing on his shoe strings and</v>

2933
01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:31.050
<v Speaker 3>just there and he finally said,</v>

2934
01:31:31.051 --> 01:31:31.884
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2935
01:31:32.190 --> 01:31:34.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything about raising pigs,</v>

2936
01:31:35.670 --> 01:31:37.230
<v Speaker 3>but I think if I was a pig,</v>

2937
01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:39.210
<v Speaker 3>this is the way I'd want to live</v>

2938
01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:42.100
<v Speaker 3>into.</v>

2939
01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:43.320
<v Speaker 3>It resonates in our soul.</v>

2940
01:31:43.321 --> 01:31:43.531
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2941
01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:44.364
<v Speaker 3>if you have,</v>

2942
01:31:44.370 --> 01:31:46.830
<v Speaker 3>if you have a conscience at all,</v>

2943
01:31:47.610 --> 01:31:48.900
<v Speaker 3>it resonates in your conscience.</v>

2944
01:31:48.901 --> 01:31:48.991
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2945
01:31:48.991 --> 01:31:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Here's your pigs up here on the screen.</v>

2946
01:31:50.791 --> 01:31:51.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2947
01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:52.830
<v Speaker 3>these pigs are just chilling.</v>

2948
01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:53.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2949
01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:54.360
<v Speaker 3>they're having a great time.</v>

2950
01:31:54.361 --> 01:31:56.730
<v Speaker 3>They're not stuck in some disgusting Penn,</v>

2951
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:58.170
<v Speaker 3>whether they're lumped in.</v>

2952
01:31:58.171 --> 01:31:58.351
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2953
01:31:58.351 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 3>there was a story recently of</v>

2954
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.050
<v Speaker 4>a farmer who they believe fell.</v>

2955
01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:03.460
<v Speaker 4>They believe he may have had a heart attack,</v>

2956
01:32:03.461 --> 01:32:08.461
<v Speaker 4>is that older gentleman fell into a pick up a pen and was killed by the pigs,</v>

2957
01:32:10.450 --> 01:32:12.580
<v Speaker 4>but he mean that's in everybody's like,</v>

2958
01:32:12.581 --> 01:32:13.540
<v Speaker 4>all pigs are vicious.</v>

2959
01:32:14.010 --> 01:32:16.090
<v Speaker 4>It's the conditions that are vicious.</v>

2960
01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:18.100
<v Speaker 4>These pigs aren't going to kill anybody.</v>

2961
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:20.830
<v Speaker 4>These pigs come right up to the in nozzle with you.</v>

2962
01:32:20.831 --> 01:32:21.071
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

2963
01:32:21.071 --> 01:32:21.840
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it.</v>

2964
01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:22.140
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2965
01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:23.910
<v Speaker 3>they will kill you if you quit moving.</v>

2966
01:32:23.970 --> 01:32:24.870
<v Speaker 3>They're omnivores.</v>

2967
01:32:24.871 --> 01:32:25.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2968
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2969
01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:25.980
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

2970
01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:26.813
<v Speaker 3>if you're dead,</v>

2971
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.840
<v Speaker 3>if you're dead,</v>

2972
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:30.600
<v Speaker 3>tell kindergarteners that want to go in and pet them.</v>

2973
01:32:30.601 --> 01:32:31.170
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2974
01:32:31.170 --> 01:32:31.591
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

2975
01:32:31.591 --> 01:32:33.030
<v Speaker 3>You're welcome to go in and pet them.</v>

2976
01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.200
<v Speaker 3>Just keep wiggling.</v>

2977
01:32:35.010 --> 01:32:36.210
<v Speaker 3>Just keep wiggling.</v>

2978
01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:38.280
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

2979
01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:41.670
<v Speaker 3>Your toes first and your fingers that in an hour there'll be to your spleen,</v>

2980
01:32:41.671 --> 01:32:42.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2981
01:32:42.001 --> 01:32:42.820
<v Speaker 3>so uh,</v>

2982
01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:43.540
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

2983
01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:44.111
<v Speaker 4>Keep moving.</v>

2984
01:32:44.111 --> 01:32:47.500
<v Speaker 4>They are omnivores and they are survivors.</v>

2985
01:32:47.530 --> 01:32:48.040
<v Speaker 4>They are,</v>

2986
01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:48.873
<v Speaker 4>they're very cool.</v>

2987
01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:53.260
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the interesting things about pigs is this huge problem with feral,</v>

2988
01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:57.160
<v Speaker 4>what we call feral hogs because they're not a native species to North America</v>

2989
01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:01.290
<v Speaker 4>and they don't really have any natural predators other than,</v>

2990
01:33:01.291 --> 01:33:01.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2991
01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:04.900
<v Speaker 4>coyotes which have sort of taken them on and mountain lions and all the other</v>

2992
01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:06.340
<v Speaker 4>animals that we have in North America.</v>

2993
01:33:06.341 --> 01:33:11.341
<v Speaker 4>But the number one invasive species problem we have as far as like big animals,</v>

2994
01:33:11.771 --> 01:33:12.640
<v Speaker 4>his pigs.</v>

2995
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.633
<v Speaker 3>There again,</v>

2996
01:33:13.670 --> 01:33:14.241
<v Speaker 3>there again,</v>

2997
01:33:14.241 --> 01:33:14.980
<v Speaker 3>the problem,</v>

2998
01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.220
<v Speaker 3>it's a political problem.</v>

2999
01:33:16.221 --> 01:33:16.880
<v Speaker 3>It's not a,</v>

3000
01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:18.500
<v Speaker 3>it's not an ecological problem.</v>

3001
01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:18.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3002
01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:20.780
<v Speaker 3>in Europe they have feral pigs too,</v>

3003
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:21.770
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a problem.</v>

3004
01:33:21.771 --> 01:33:22.604
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>

3005
01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:25.790
<v Speaker 3>Because you can go out and shoot a pig and sell it to a restaurant,</v>

3006
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:27.620
<v Speaker 3>you can sell it to a neighbor.</v>

3007
01:33:27.890 --> 01:33:28.880
<v Speaker 3>They allow,</v>

3008
01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:29.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3009
01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:31.190
<v Speaker 3>wild shot animals,</v>

3010
01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:34.970
<v Speaker 3>deer and pigs to go into commerce.</v>

3011
01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:37.130
<v Speaker 4>Sorry about that though,</v>

3012
01:33:37.131 --> 01:33:41.270
<v Speaker 4>is from a sportsman's point of view that you're going to have people out there</v>

3013
01:33:41.271 --> 01:33:46.271
<v Speaker 4>sniping and poaching deer and all the really precious wild animals and selling</v>

3014
01:33:48.531 --> 01:33:50.810
<v Speaker 4>them to restaurants and there won't be any there for hunter.</v>

3015
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:57.160
<v Speaker 3>The thing is nature has a way of balancing it out and when there's an</v>

3016
01:33:57.161 --> 01:33:58.360
<v Speaker 3>overpopulation,</v>

3017
01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:00.250
<v Speaker 3>they're easy to get and then once they.</v>

3018
01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.570
<v Speaker 3>Once they get harder to get.</v>

3019
01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:02.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3020
01:34:02.910 --> 01:34:03.491
<v Speaker 4>Then people,</v>

3021
01:34:03.491 --> 01:34:06.580
<v Speaker 4>then people get discouraged from hunting because they're too hard to get.</v>

3022
01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:09.170
<v Speaker 4>I would be more in support of that for pigs.</v>

3023
01:34:09.171 --> 01:34:12.010
<v Speaker 4>Then the other animals simply because pigs breed all year round,</v>

3024
01:34:12.011 --> 01:34:14.530
<v Speaker 4>they'll get off several litters a year of many,</v>

3025
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:17.840
<v Speaker 4>but whereas a deer will have one fond,</v>

3026
01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:18.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3027
01:34:18.450 --> 01:34:21.310
<v Speaker 4>and they'll have a phone or two and they'll have them once a year.</v>

3028
01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:23.500
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe you could control it with licenses.</v>

3029
01:34:23.501 --> 01:34:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Just give people,</v>

3030
01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:24.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3031
01:34:24.851 --> 01:34:25.240
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

3032
01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.660
<v Speaker 3>You can harvest so many a deer,</v>

3033
01:34:26.710 --> 01:34:27.461
<v Speaker 3>so many a year,</v>

3034
01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:27.881
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3035
01:34:27.881 --> 01:34:28.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3036
01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:30.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of ways to skin the cat.</v>

3037
01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:32.230
<v Speaker 3>The bottom line I'm getting too though,</v>

3038
01:34:32.231 --> 01:34:34.090
<v Speaker 3>is that when you,</v>

3039
01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.210
<v Speaker 3>when you prohibit a food source from entering commerce,</v>

3040
01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:39.190
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3041
01:34:39.190 --> 01:34:40.023
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3042
01:34:40.570 --> 01:34:45.570
<v Speaker 3>you automatically have the government manipulating a,</v>

3043
01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:46.710
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3044
01:34:46.710 --> 01:34:47.500
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3045
01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:49.720
<v Speaker 3>a supply and demand situation.</v>

3046
01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:52.510
<v Speaker 3>That's the reality.</v>

3047
01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.130
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

3048
01:34:54.370 --> 01:34:54.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3049
01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.331
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

3050
01:34:55.331 --> 01:34:55.520
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3051
01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:56.380
<v Speaker 3>the people that are,</v>

3052
01:34:56.410 --> 01:34:57.620
<v Speaker 3>that are concerned about,</v>

3053
01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:59.210
<v Speaker 3>and you go down some areas,</v>

3054
01:34:59.211 --> 01:34:59.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3055
01:34:59.340 --> 01:34:59.550
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3056
01:34:59.550 --> 01:35:01.370
<v Speaker 3>the wild pig problem is a real,</v>

3057
01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:05.960
<v Speaker 3>it's a real land abuse problem where they're having him in suburban San Jose,</v>

3058
01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:09.800
<v Speaker 3>San Jose as people are having their lawns chewed up.</v>

3059
01:35:09.801 --> 01:35:12.920
<v Speaker 3>There was a big news story about it the other day where they showed these pigs</v>

3060
01:35:12.921 --> 01:35:16.610
<v Speaker 3>running across people's lawns and this normal suburban street,</v>

3061
01:35:16.611 --> 01:35:17.780
<v Speaker 3>they're chewing up their lawn.</v>

3062
01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:19.650
<v Speaker 3>They're resourceful and they're smart,</v>

3063
01:35:19.651 --> 01:35:19.770
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3064
01:35:19.770 --> 01:35:19.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3065
01:35:19.911 --> 01:35:20.960
<v Speaker 3>pitching the smartest,</v>

3066
01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:24.080
<v Speaker 3>supposedly one of the smartest animals there is.</v>

3067
01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:24.350
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3068
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.951
<v Speaker 3>and they are,</v>

3069
01:35:24.951 --> 01:35:25.221
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3070
01:35:25.221 --> 01:35:25.791
<v Speaker 3>they're really,</v>

3071
01:35:25.791 --> 01:35:26.624
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3072
01:35:26.630 --> 01:35:27.463
<v Speaker 3>they're really smart.</v>

3073
01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:28.061
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3074
01:35:28.061 --> 01:35:28.910
<v Speaker 3>so if we would,</v>

3075
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:33.520
<v Speaker 3>if we would allow people to actually practice,</v>

3076
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:38.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm consenting adult voluntary commerce on some of these things.</v>

3077
01:35:38.690 --> 01:35:39.200
<v Speaker 3>It would,</v>

3078
01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.770
<v Speaker 3>it would then incentivize innovation,</v>

3079
01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:48.580
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurship and the antidote to all of the depressing things we've talked</v>

3080
01:35:50.391 --> 01:35:52.160
<v Speaker 3>about [inaudible] and,</v>

3081
01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:53.150
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

3082
01:35:53.150 --> 01:35:57.680
<v Speaker 3>and our side then would rise and the other side would have to adapt.</v>

3083
01:35:57.681 --> 01:35:59.240
<v Speaker 3>They'd either have to down,</v>

3084
01:35:59.290 --> 01:35:59.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3085
01:35:59.790 --> 01:36:00.010
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3086
01:36:00.010 --> 01:36:00.800
<v Speaker 3>there's talk,</v>

3087
01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:01.371
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

3088
01:36:01.371 --> 01:36:05.840
<v Speaker 3>right now among the poultry industry of trying to go antibiotic free in 10 years</v>

3089
01:36:06.650 --> 01:36:07.221
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3090
01:36:07.221 --> 01:36:07.881
<v Speaker 3>in order to do it,</v>

3091
01:36:07.881 --> 01:36:12.410
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have to greatly drop the bird size in their houses.</v>

3092
01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:16.910
<v Speaker 3>And I know that there's a lot of research going into building these living</v>

3093
01:36:16.911 --> 01:36:20.690
<v Speaker 3>compost bedding situations in these houses.</v>

3094
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Even in the poultry industry.</v>

3095
01:36:22.730 --> 01:36:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3096
01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:23.430
<v Speaker 3>In,</v>

3097
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:24.620
<v Speaker 3>in the poultry industry.</v>

3098
01:36:24.621 --> 01:36:25.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3099
01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:25.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3100
01:36:25.491 --> 01:36:25.671
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3101
01:36:25.671 --> 01:36:26.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3102
01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:27.193
<v Speaker 3>Denmark,</v>

3103
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Denmark made the change.</v>

3104
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.980
<v Speaker 3>They outlawed,</v>

3105
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm a factory pork houses years ago.</v>

3106
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:35.870
<v Speaker 3>They'd been fine.</v>

3107
01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:37.550
<v Speaker 3>They've gone too deep bedded,</v>

3108
01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:38.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3109
01:36:38.211 --> 01:36:41.530
<v Speaker 3>houses completely different situation and um,</v>

3110
01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:44.270
<v Speaker 3>and it makes it a completely different living environment.</v>

3111
01:36:44.271 --> 01:36:44.860
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3112
01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:45.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3113
01:36:45.170 --> 01:36:45.711
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

3114
01:36:45.711 --> 01:36:46.544
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3115
01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.470
<v Speaker 3>you can make those changes.</v>

3116
01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:49.101
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

3117
01:36:49.101 --> 01:36:50.450
<v Speaker 3>they're not insurmountable.</v>

3118
01:36:50.451 --> 01:36:53.630
<v Speaker 3>And those changes though still are not where you're at.</v>

3119
01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:54.560
<v Speaker 3>You're in,</v>

3120
01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:59.560
<v Speaker 3>you've got these animals moving around and his giant farm and you move your</v>

3121
01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:02.870
<v Speaker 3>electric fences from place to place.</v>

3122
01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:03.600
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

3123
01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.433
<v Speaker 3>What's the,</v>

3124
01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:07.580
<v Speaker 3>the method like how do you get the animals to move?</v>

3125
01:37:07.581 --> 01:37:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Like when you,</v>

3126
01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:11.570
<v Speaker 3>like you have them in one area for like a day day.</v>

3127
01:37:11.571 --> 01:37:12.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3128
01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:13.440
<v Speaker 3>How big is the area that you.</v>

3129
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:14.270
<v Speaker 3>Lemon.</v>

3130
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:15.140
<v Speaker 3>Let's take cows.</v>

3131
01:37:15.141 --> 01:37:15.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3132
01:37:15.450 --> 01:37:16.231
<v Speaker 3>we've gone as,</v>

3133
01:37:16.231 --> 01:37:20.360
<v Speaker 3>as tight as a 400 head on two acres for a day.</v>

3134
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:24.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's pretty tight at and an acre is a football field just for people</v>

3135
01:37:24.861 --> 01:37:26.240
<v Speaker 3>trying to visualize what's an acre.</v>

3136
01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:27.830
<v Speaker 3>It's roughly a football field.</v>

3137
01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:28.491
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3138
01:37:28.491 --> 01:37:28.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3139
01:37:28.730 --> 01:37:30.680
<v Speaker 3>imagine 400 cows on two acres.</v>

3140
01:37:31.110 --> 01:37:31.811
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty dense.</v>

3141
01:37:31.811 --> 01:37:32.050
<v Speaker 3>All.</v>

3142
01:37:32.050 --> 01:37:32.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3143
01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:33.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3144
01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:36.350
<v Speaker 3>but the beauty is that when you move them all the time like this,</v>

3145
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:37.730
<v Speaker 3>they get very docile.</v>

3146
01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:38.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3147
01:37:38.370 --> 01:37:38.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3148
01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:39.423
<v Speaker 3>their route,</v>

3149
01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:43.580
<v Speaker 3>their routine and you incentivize it because every day at 4:00 when you go out</v>

3150
01:37:43.581 --> 01:37:44.414
<v Speaker 3>and call them,</v>

3151
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:48.260
<v Speaker 3>they're going to a new salad bar everyday at 4:00,</v>

3152
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:51.400
<v Speaker 3>a certain call meant there's a bowl of ice cream for you.</v>

3153
01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:51.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3154
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:54.260
<v Speaker 3>you'd get pretty used to that call as well.</v>

3155
01:37:54.330 --> 01:37:54.801
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you do?</v>

3156
01:37:54.801 --> 01:37:55.600
<v Speaker 3>You call them?</v>

3157
01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:56.191
<v Speaker 3>We call them.</v>

3158
01:37:56.191 --> 01:37:56.851
<v Speaker 3>We don't hurt them,</v>

3159
01:37:56.851 --> 01:37:57.381
<v Speaker 3>we call it.</v>

3160
01:37:57.381 --> 01:37:58.410
<v Speaker 3>What do you call?</v>

3161
01:37:58.411 --> 01:37:59.490
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a noisy make?</v>

3162
01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:06.140
<v Speaker 3>And so they hear that and they know it's a little dinner Bell Dinner Bell.</v>

3163
01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:06.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3164
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:07.583
<v Speaker 3>And they just,</v>

3165
01:38:07.630 --> 01:38:08.790
<v Speaker 3>they just fall right on.</v>

3166
01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:09.571
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3167
01:38:09.571 --> 01:38:10.000
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3168
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:10.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3169
01:38:10.290 --> 01:38:11.850
<v Speaker 3>then you set up this new,</v>

3170
01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:13.500
<v Speaker 3>you put the stakes down,</v>

3171
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:15.120
<v Speaker 3>set up this new area,</v>

3172
01:38:15.210 --> 01:38:15.750
<v Speaker 3>the fences,</v>

3173
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:16.830
<v Speaker 3>totally portable.</v>

3174
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:18.090
<v Speaker 3>So you're essentially,</v>

3175
01:38:18.091 --> 01:38:18.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3176
01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:22.720
<v Speaker 3>envision a field like a ladder and the permanent fit,</v>

3177
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:23.200
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3178
01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.680
<v Speaker 3>the edges of the field are the,</v>

3179
01:38:25.710 --> 01:38:26.191
<v Speaker 3>are the,</v>

3180
01:38:26.191 --> 01:38:26.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3181
01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:31.290
<v Speaker 3>the stringers of the ladder and the portable fences are the rungs.</v>

3182
01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:36.870
<v Speaker 3>So the permanent are there all the time and we simply move the rungs,</v>

3183
01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:37.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3184
01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:42.030
<v Speaker 3>contract or expand the rungs based on how much grasser is,</v>

3185
01:38:42.031 --> 01:38:43.440
<v Speaker 3>how many there are in the herd,</v>

3186
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:44.370
<v Speaker 3>get that sort of thing.</v>

3187
01:38:44.670 --> 01:38:45.031
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

3188
01:38:45.031 --> 01:38:46.470
<v Speaker 3>it's a very artistic,</v>

3189
01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:46.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3190
01:38:46.741 --> 01:38:47.610
<v Speaker 3>there's a science,</v>

3191
01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:50.550
<v Speaker 3>but there's also an art to it as we,</v>

3192
01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:53.730
<v Speaker 3>as we essentially give them one plateful of day.</v>

3193
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:57.090
<v Speaker 3>And you alternate animals in these areas.</v>

3194
01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:57.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3195
01:38:57.630 --> 01:38:59.040
<v Speaker 3>so the cows go through first,</v>

3196
01:38:59.070 --> 01:39:01.080
<v Speaker 3>then the egg mobiles come in after them,</v>

3197
01:39:01.110 --> 01:39:04.200
<v Speaker 3>so after the cows are there and then you push the chicken house in there.</v>

3198
01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:05.830
<v Speaker 3>He fence that in as well.</v>

3199
01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:06.540
<v Speaker 3>That's not fit.</v>

3200
01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:08.460
<v Speaker 3>Those chickens can run anywhere they want to.</v>

3201
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:09.361
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

3202
01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:12.440
<v Speaker 3>they just hang around the egg mobile because that's where feed and water and</v>

3203
01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:13.230
<v Speaker 3>nest boxes.</v>

3204
01:39:13.230 --> 01:39:15.180
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have to fence them and don't have to fence them.</v>

3205
01:39:15.181 --> 01:39:15.441
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

3206
01:39:15.441 --> 01:39:16.020
<v Speaker 3>they go out,</v>

3207
01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:16.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3208
01:39:16.261 --> 01:39:20.970
<v Speaker 3>up to 200 yards and scavenge and scratch out cow patties and when it starts</v>

3209
01:39:20.971 --> 01:39:23.580
<v Speaker 3>getting dark they come back and it will start coming back in.</v>

3210
01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:24.930
<v Speaker 3>So we have it in our yard.</v>

3211
01:39:24.931 --> 01:39:25.241
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

3212
01:39:25.241 --> 01:39:25.560
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>

3213
01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:26.550
<v Speaker 3>we leave the door open.</v>

3214
01:39:26.551 --> 01:39:27.260
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3215
01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:27.901
<v Speaker 3>And then at the end,</v>

3216
01:39:27.901 --> 01:39:28.890
<v Speaker 3>at night we shut the door.</v>

3217
01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:30.180
<v Speaker 3>They know that.</v>

3218
01:39:30.370 --> 01:39:30.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3219
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:31.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3220
01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:34.640
<v Speaker 3>chickens or your chicken scared,</v>

3221
01:39:34.650 --> 01:39:34.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3222
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:38.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean we use the word slang and so they're in,</v>

3223
01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:41.910
<v Speaker 3>their instinct is to get somewhere secure for the night.</v>

3224
01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:44.600
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to just sit out on the ground night.</v>

3225
01:39:44.610 --> 01:39:45.031
<v Speaker 3>So there.</v>

3226
01:39:45.031 --> 01:39:45.630
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

3227
01:39:45.630 --> 01:39:46.340
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

3228
01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:48.240
<v Speaker 3>your coop or the egg immobile.</v>

3229
01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:49.500
<v Speaker 3>That's a secure place.</v>

3230
01:39:49.501 --> 01:39:51.450
<v Speaker 3>And they naturally are drawn to that,</v>

3231
01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:52.051
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3232
01:39:52.051 --> 01:39:52.321
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

3233
01:39:52.321 --> 01:39:54.360
<v Speaker 3>as the dark starts to go down.</v>

3234
01:39:54.810 --> 01:39:55.890
<v Speaker 3>So for them,</v>

3235
01:39:55.891 --> 01:39:56.910
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to worry about that.</v>

3236
01:39:56.911 --> 01:39:58.920
<v Speaker 3>You just move this giant structure that you've created,</v>

3237
01:39:58.921 --> 01:39:59.970
<v Speaker 3>which is very innovative.</v>

3238
01:39:59.971 --> 01:40:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Is this your design?</v>

3239
01:40:00.841 --> 01:40:01.510
<v Speaker 3>The structure?</v>

3240
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3241
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:02.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3242
01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:06.060
<v Speaker 3>See if you can pull up the egg immobile because it's pretty interesting to see</v>

3243
01:40:06.061 --> 01:40:07.650
<v Speaker 3>if he could find the video of it.</v>

3244
01:40:07.651 --> 01:40:08.940
<v Speaker 3>It was in one of those,</v>

3245
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:09.783
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3246
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:12.000
<v Speaker 3>w polyface,</v>

3247
01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:12.571
<v Speaker 3>that's what you call it.</v>

3248
01:40:12.571 --> 01:40:17.571
<v Speaker 3>Polyface farm is one of those videos your design,</v>

3249
01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:20.750
<v Speaker 3>you just figured out how to stack them in there and this way.</v>

3250
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:21.241
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3251
01:40:21.241 --> 01:40:22.830
<v Speaker 3>essentially it's essentially,</v>

3252
01:40:22.831 --> 01:40:23.640
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

3253
01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:25.950
<v Speaker 3>it's a chicken house on wheels is what it is.</v>

3254
01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.353
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3255
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:28.021
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

3256
01:40:28.021 --> 01:40:28.380
<v Speaker 3>where you,</v>

3257
01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:30.900
<v Speaker 3>where you would normally make a chicken house for example.</v>

3258
01:40:30.901 --> 01:40:31.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3259
01:40:31.021 --> 01:40:31.854
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

3260
01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:33.660
<v Speaker 3>Where you normally make a chicken house,</v>

3261
01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:34.920
<v Speaker 3>a stationary.</v>

3262
01:40:35.250 --> 01:40:36.780
<v Speaker 3>This is simply modeled on wheels,</v>

3263
01:40:36.781 --> 01:40:37.614
<v Speaker 3>on an axle,</v>

3264
01:40:37.770 --> 01:40:38.760
<v Speaker 3>all like a trailer,</v>

3265
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:44.030
<v Speaker 3>and you just hooked up to it with a tractor and the chickens are all inside and</v>

3266
01:40:44.311 --> 01:40:48.600
<v Speaker 3>you can move it up the public road or to the far side of the field or whatever.</v>

3267
01:40:48.930 --> 01:40:50.100
<v Speaker 3>And there's the guard dog,</v>

3268
01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.320
<v Speaker 3>the guard dogs with them as well,</v>

3269
01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:53.680
<v Speaker 3>and the guard dog keeps coyotes,</v>

3270
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:58.390
<v Speaker 4>coyotes and hawks and things that like drumsticks for dinner.</v>

3271
01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.500
<v Speaker 4>He keeps those away.</v>

3272
01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:00.550
<v Speaker 4>We lost the chicken.</v>

3273
01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:01.750
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what happened.</v>

3274
01:41:01.751 --> 01:41:03.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure it was a Hark.</v>

3275
01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:05.350
<v Speaker 4>Something just scoop one up.</v>

3276
01:41:05.730 --> 01:41:06.563
<v Speaker 4>Just vish.</v>

3277
01:41:06.630 --> 01:41:08.020
<v Speaker 4>Just vanished.</v>

3278
01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:08.381
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3279
01:41:08.381 --> 01:41:08.621
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3280
01:41:08.621 --> 01:41:09.550
<v Speaker 4>there's no nothing.</v>

3281
01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:10.091
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

3282
01:41:10.091 --> 01:41:10.390
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3283
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.721
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3284
01:41:10.721 --> 01:41:11.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3285
01:41:11.050 --> 01:41:11.531
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>

3286
01:41:11.531 --> 01:41:12.850
<v Speaker 4>That's why you got a lot of chickens,</v>

3287
01:41:12.851 --> 01:41:13.180
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3288
01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:13.840
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3289
01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:14.081
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3290
01:41:14.081 --> 01:41:14.261
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3291
01:41:14.261 --> 01:41:14.610
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3292
01:41:14.610 --> 01:41:15.431
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot of chickens.</v>

3293
01:41:15.431 --> 01:41:16.630
<v Speaker 4>That's a thousand chickens.</v>

3294
01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:16.871
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

3295
01:41:16.871 --> 01:41:18.910
<v Speaker 4>Those egg ligand laying chickens are those.</v>

3296
01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Those are egg layers and you have different chickens that are egg laying</v>

3297
01:41:21.821 --> 01:41:23.810
<v Speaker 4>chickens in different chickens that are meat chicken.</v>

3298
01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:24.650
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

3299
01:41:24.650 --> 01:41:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Dairy and beef.</v>

3300
01:41:25.950 --> 01:41:26.900
<v Speaker 3>A dairy,</v>

3301
01:41:27.230 --> 01:41:27.591
<v Speaker 3>dairy,</v>

3302
01:41:27.591 --> 01:41:28.424
<v Speaker 3>cows,</v>

3303
01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.290
<v Speaker 3>a grow.</v>

3304
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:31.880
<v Speaker 3>Make a lot of milk.</v>

3305
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:34.430
<v Speaker 3>Beef cows grow bulkier.</v>

3306
01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:36.920
<v Speaker 3>Same Way with a chickens.</v>

3307
01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:38.810
<v Speaker 3>Layers.</v>

3308
01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Layers have a.</v>

3309
01:41:40.110 --> 01:41:42.140
<v Speaker 3>they're genetically selected.</v>

3310
01:41:42.141 --> 01:41:43.070
<v Speaker 3>Those breeds,</v>

3311
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:44.263
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3312
01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:47.450
<v Speaker 3>they lay eggs and they have a physique more like,</v>

3313
01:41:47.451 --> 01:41:48.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3314
01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:51.200
<v Speaker 3>Koby Bryant and the meat chickens have,</v>

3315
01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:51.830
<v Speaker 3>have a seat,</v>

3316
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:52.700
<v Speaker 3>have a physique.</v>

3317

<v Speaker 4>If you're going to eat it,</v>

3322
01:41:58.021 --> 01:41:59.100
<v Speaker 4>you want to Emmett Smith,</v>

3323
01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:00.360
<v Speaker 4>if you want to lay an egg,</v>

3324

<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3331
01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:13.880
<v Speaker 4>it's essentially just the breed of chicken self.</v>

3332
01:42:14.110 --> 01:42:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3336
01:42:15.701 --> 01:42:16.534
<v Speaker 3>I mean all these,</v>

3337
01:42:16.650 --> 01:42:18.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean a hogs,</v>

3338
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:19.833
<v Speaker 3>sheep,</v>

3339
01:42:19.930 --> 01:42:21.440
<v Speaker 3>sheep are known for their,</v>

3340
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:22.780
<v Speaker 3>especially for their wool,</v>

3341
01:42:23.050 --> 01:42:23.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3342
01:42:23.201 --> 01:42:23.511
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

3343
01:42:23.511 --> 01:42:24.520
<v Speaker 3>like the Merinos,</v>

3344
01:42:24.521 --> 01:42:24.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3345
01:42:24.701 --> 01:42:25.690
<v Speaker 3>they're known for their wool.</v>

3346
01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:27.490
<v Speaker 3>Others are known more for their meat,</v>

3347
01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:28.750
<v Speaker 3>a pigs.</v>

3348
01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Some pigs are known for their fat.</v>

3349
01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.100
<v Speaker 3>They were called Lard hogs,</v>

3350
01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:33.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3351
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:35.530
<v Speaker 3>back in the day we ate lard,</v>

3352
01:42:35.531 --> 01:42:35.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3353
01:42:35.921 --> 01:42:36.640
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3354
01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.380
<v Speaker 3>and so they would get real fat,</v>

3355
01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:38.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3356
01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:41.350
<v Speaker 3>other picture known for the length of their loin,</v>

3357
01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:43.270
<v Speaker 3>others for their maternal instincts,</v>

3358
01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:43.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3359
01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:43.990
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>

3360
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:45.430
<v Speaker 3>big litters.</v>

3361
01:42:45.670 --> 01:42:46.330
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

3362
01:42:46.330 --> 01:42:49.450
<v Speaker 3>all of these breeds have different characteristics.</v>

3363
01:42:49.451 --> 01:42:51.700
<v Speaker 3>Do you only have hands or do you have roosters as well?</v>

3364
01:42:52.090 --> 01:42:53.350
<v Speaker 3>We have roosters as well.</v>

3365
01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:54.730
<v Speaker 3>The eggs are not all,</v>

3366
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.340
<v Speaker 3>we don't have enough roosters to fertilize all of them,</v>

3367
01:42:57.790 --> 01:42:59.770
<v Speaker 3>but we do have enough roosters so that,</v>

3368
01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:00.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3369
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:02.530
<v Speaker 3>we get kids can watch them cro and we can,</v>

3370
01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:03.873
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3371
01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:06.880
<v Speaker 3>I've had a lot of people say that,</v>

3372
01:43:07.210 --> 01:43:07.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3373
01:43:07.930 --> 01:43:09.010
<v Speaker 3>that are um,</v>

3374
01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:10.333
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3375
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:12.330
<v Speaker 3>transcendentalists or you know,</v>

3376
01:43:12.331 --> 01:43:13.000
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3377
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:13.301
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3378
01:43:13.301 --> 01:43:13.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3379
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:14.020
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

3380
01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:14.530
<v Speaker 3>if that,</v>

3381
01:43:14.530 --> 01:43:16.750
<v Speaker 3>if we actually come back as a different being,</v>

3382
01:43:16.751 --> 01:43:19.300
<v Speaker 3>they really want to come back as a rooster at polyphase.</v>

3383
01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:20.340
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3384
01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:23.870
<v Speaker 3>Because they got about 200 hens per rooster.</v>

3385
01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:26.740
<v Speaker 4>It seems like you get out run.</v>

3386
01:43:27.210 --> 01:43:28.280
<v Speaker 4>It would just start running.</v>

3387
01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:29.360
<v Speaker 4>They would tell you what to do.</v>

3388
01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3389
01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:31.760
<v Speaker 4>They can get hit and pecked.</v>

3390
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:32.031
<v Speaker 4>D.</v>

3391
01:43:32.031 --> 01:43:32.361
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3392
01:43:32.361 --> 01:43:32.850
<v Speaker 4>Hand.</v>

3393
01:43:32.850 --> 01:43:34.190
<v Speaker 4>That's the other term.</v>

3394
01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:36.440
<v Speaker 4>Chickens being scared and Henpeck.</v>

3395
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:39.470
<v Speaker 4>Those are both real and henpecks do pac man.</v>

3396
01:43:39.530 --> 01:43:40.041
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3397
01:43:40.041 --> 01:43:42.050
<v Speaker 4>They do wild pigs in San Jose</v>

3398
01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:43.613
<v Speaker 3>and they.</v>

3399
01:43:44.010 --> 01:43:44.521
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow,</v>

3400
01:43:44.521 --> 01:43:45.354
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

3401
01:43:45.810 --> 01:43:46.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3402
01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:46.590
<v Speaker 3>he's getting,</v>

3403
01:43:46.590 --> 01:43:47.580
<v Speaker 3>he's getting food,</v>

3404
01:43:47.581 --> 01:43:48.414
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3405
01:43:48.490 --> 01:43:50.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean they have a real problem now.</v>

3406
01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 4>It's just starting to make its way up there.</v>

3407
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:55.460
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't associate California with wild pigs.</v>

3408
01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:56.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3409
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:57.380
<v Speaker 3>what I was getting at was,</v>

3410
01:43:57.381 --> 01:43:59.000
<v Speaker 3>do you breed your own chickens?</v>

3411
01:43:59.001 --> 01:43:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

3412
01:43:59.560 --> 01:43:59.890
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

3413
01:43:59.890 --> 01:44:00.980
<v Speaker 3>We have just started,</v>

3414
01:44:00.981 --> 01:44:01.671
<v Speaker 3>we've just started.</v>

3415
01:44:01.671 --> 01:44:02.870
<v Speaker 3>We haven't in the past.</v>

3416
01:44:02.871 --> 01:44:04.280
<v Speaker 3>We've always gotten it from a hatchery.</v>

3417
01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:06.440
<v Speaker 3>But what we've seen,</v>

3418
01:44:06.441 --> 01:44:07.940
<v Speaker 3>you'd find this fascinating.</v>

3419
01:44:07.941 --> 01:44:10.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure what we've seen is in my lifetime,</v>

3420
01:44:10.461 --> 01:44:11.330
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not that old,</v>

3421
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:16.610
<v Speaker 3>but I have watched the genetic viability of lot of animals,</v>

3422
01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:21.640
<v Speaker 3>of domestic livestock a drop because of the props that we,</v>

3423
01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:24.410
<v Speaker 3>the crutches that we use antibiotics,</v>

3424
01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:27.380
<v Speaker 3>a hot feed candy bar.</v>

3425
01:44:27.381 --> 01:44:28.850
<v Speaker 3>I called candy bar diets</v>

3426
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:33.050
<v Speaker 3>and unnatural feeding regimens.</v>

3427
01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.153
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

3428
01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:35.533
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3429
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:37.850
<v Speaker 3>we have really seen the,</v>

3430
01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:40.190
<v Speaker 3>the strength that the,</v>

3431
01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:40.731
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

3432
01:44:40.731 --> 01:44:41.564
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3433
01:44:41.810 --> 01:44:45.380
<v Speaker 3>the viability of these farm animals plummet.</v>

3434
01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:47.600
<v Speaker 3>So our son Daniel,</v>

3435
01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:48.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3436
01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:48.910
<v Speaker 3>when he was eight,</v>

3437
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:52.460
<v Speaker 3>started with rabbits and these are meat rabbits,</v>

3438
01:44:52.461 --> 01:44:53.450
<v Speaker 3>not pet rabbits,</v>

3439
01:44:53.451 --> 01:44:54.380
<v Speaker 3>but their meat rabbits.</v>

3440
01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:56.960
<v Speaker 3>Some friends had a couple of those and a buck and they,</v>

3441
01:44:56.961 --> 01:44:57.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3442
01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:57.560
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3443
01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:59.930
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't take them to a new apartment where they were moving.</v>

3444
01:44:59.931 --> 01:45:00.764
<v Speaker 3>So they said,</v>

3445
01:45:01.130 --> 01:45:01.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3446
01:45:01.401 --> 01:45:02.330
<v Speaker 3>would you like these rabbits?</v>

3447
01:45:02.331 --> 01:45:02.451
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3448
01:45:02.451 --> 01:45:02.871
<v Speaker 3>he was Kinda,</v>

3449
01:45:02.871 --> 01:45:03.321
<v Speaker 3>he was eight,</v>

3450
01:45:03.321 --> 01:45:03.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3451
01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:06.230
<v Speaker 3>eight years old is about the time to start an entrepreneur business,</v>

3452
01:45:06.231 --> 01:45:07.064
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3453
01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:08.420
<v Speaker 3>And so he said,</v>

3454
01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:08.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3455
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3456
01:45:08.690 --> 01:45:10.280
<v Speaker 3>as I started with chickens when I was 10,</v>

3457
01:45:10.281 --> 01:45:11.420
<v Speaker 3>so I was two years late,</v>

3458
01:45:11.421 --> 01:45:11.760
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3459
01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:12.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3460
01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:15.230
<v Speaker 3>he started rapping when he was eight and so he said,</v>

3461
01:45:15.231 --> 01:45:15.351
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3462
01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:15.650
<v Speaker 3>I'll take,</v>

3463
01:45:15.650 --> 01:45:16.750
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to raise some race,</v>

3464
01:45:16.751 --> 01:45:17.301
<v Speaker 3>some rabbits.</v>

3465
01:45:17.301 --> 01:45:20.570
<v Speaker 3>So he did that and if you read any like,</v>

3466
01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:20.781
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3467
01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:21.860
<v Speaker 3>rabbit rearing book,</v>

3468
01:45:21.861 --> 01:45:23.510
<v Speaker 3>it'll say never give them grass,</v>

3469
01:45:23.511 --> 01:45:23.811
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3470
01:45:23.811 --> 01:45:25.880
<v Speaker 3>don't give them that because they'll get diarrhea and die.</v>

3471
01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:29.150
<v Speaker 3>And of course that's exactly what we found.</v>

3472
01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:29.980
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3473
01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:30.860
<v Speaker 3>but what he did,</v>

3474
01:45:30.861 --> 01:45:31.191
<v Speaker 3>he did,</v>

3475
01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:32.660
<v Speaker 3>he did what's called line breeding,</v>

3476
01:45:32.661 --> 01:45:34.250
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of a wild breeding.</v>

3477
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:39.970
<v Speaker 3>And it took him five years to work through a lot of mortality and calling.</v>

3478
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:43.790
<v Speaker 3>But in five years the rabbit started really getting strong,</v>

3479
01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:45.133
<v Speaker 3>vibrant,</v>

3480
01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:46.340
<v Speaker 3>big litters.</v>

3481
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:47.323
<v Speaker 3>Healthy.</v>

3482
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:50.300
<v Speaker 3>Now 24 years later,</v>

3483
01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:52.100
<v Speaker 3>they're almost bulletproof.</v>

3484
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.863
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3485
01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:56.900
<v Speaker 3>and what we've seen in the,</v>

3486
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.770
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

3487
01:45:57.770 --> 01:45:58.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3488
01:45:58.130 --> 01:46:03.130
<v Speaker 3>the genetic selection process over that time of not using any crutches and just</v>

3489
01:46:03.531 --> 01:46:05.000
<v Speaker 3>letting it be kind of a,</v>

3490
01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:05.631
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3491
01:46:05.631 --> 01:46:06.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3492
01:46:06.110 --> 01:46:11.110
<v Speaker 3>a Darwinian selection process has made us now want to want to do that,</v>

3493
01:46:12.050 --> 01:46:13.790
<v Speaker 3>duplicate that with our other animals.</v>

3494
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:15.440
<v Speaker 3>And so we've,</v>

3495
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:18.200
<v Speaker 3>we started last year with our chickens taking our oldest,</v>

3496
01:46:18.201 --> 01:46:19.700
<v Speaker 3>what we call survivor genetics,</v>

3497
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:21.650
<v Speaker 3>the oldest hands that are still laying,</v>

3498
01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:23.360
<v Speaker 3>mating them to the roosters.</v>

3499
01:46:23.630 --> 01:46:26.840
<v Speaker 3>And what we want to do is just keep taking the oldest hens,</v>

3500
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:28.400
<v Speaker 3>meeting them back to the,</v>

3501
01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:29.450
<v Speaker 3>meeting them to the roosters.</v>

3502
01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:33.680
<v Speaker 3>So we eventually create a survivor genetic.</v>

3503
01:46:33.681 --> 01:46:34.460
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

3504
01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:36.740
<v Speaker 3>that's the chicken that new to hide.</v>

3505
01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:37.640
<v Speaker 3>When the Hawk came,</v>

3506
01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:40.760
<v Speaker 3>that's the chicken that knew to get under shelter when the rain came,</v>

3507
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:41.880
<v Speaker 3>that's the chicken that,</v>

3508
01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:44.210
<v Speaker 3>that didn't get flu,</v>

3509
01:46:44.211 --> 01:46:46.030
<v Speaker 3>that didn't get bugged,</v>

3510
01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:47.270
<v Speaker 3>that didn't have a prolapse.</v>

3511
01:46:47.271 --> 01:46:48.380
<v Speaker 3>The first eggs she did,</v>

3512
01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:49.433
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3513
01:46:49.650 --> 01:46:50.940
<v Speaker 3>I call it survivor genetics.</v>

3514
01:46:50.941 --> 01:46:52.350
<v Speaker 3>We're doing that now with our cows.</v>

3515
01:46:52.351 --> 01:46:56.310
<v Speaker 3>We're selecting our own bulls and breeding from our own bulls.</v>

3516
01:46:56.670 --> 01:47:00.150
<v Speaker 3>And we're very excited about what this,</v>

3517
01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:05.420
<v Speaker 3>this kind of wild line breeding pipe type of thing can do if you knock out all</v>

3518
01:47:06.301 --> 01:47:07.134
<v Speaker 3>the crutches.</v>

3519
01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:09.033
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3520
01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:14.250
<v Speaker 3>the problem is that it puts you crossways of the animal welfare crowd because</v>

3521
01:47:14.251 --> 01:47:15.084
<v Speaker 3>they can't,</v>

3522
01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:18.390
<v Speaker 3>they can't abide the idea that if I have a sick animal,</v>

3523
01:47:18.570 --> 01:47:19.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to let it die.</v>

3524
01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:20.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3525
01:47:20.890 --> 01:47:21.520
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

3526
01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:21.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3527
01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:26.100
<v Speaker 3>they've been Bambi and thumper right into death to where every,</v>

3528
01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:26.881
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

3529
01:47:26.881 --> 01:47:27.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3530
01:47:27.570 --> 01:47:27.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3531
01:47:27.870 --> 01:47:31.890
<v Speaker 3>every dog and cat has to have a monogram ll bean,</v>

3532
01:47:31.891 --> 01:47:33.180
<v Speaker 3>cushing in an air condition,</v>

3533
01:47:33.181 --> 01:47:34.014
<v Speaker 3>any room.</v>

3534
01:47:34.110 --> 01:47:34.620
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

3535
01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:36.180
<v Speaker 3>that's the only way to care for animals.</v>

3536
01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.850
<v Speaker 3>And the problem is that we don't,</v>

3537
01:47:39.090 --> 01:47:43.170
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to get genetic strength if we don't let nature call out the weak</v>

3538
01:47:43.171 --> 01:47:43.411
<v Speaker 3>links.</v>

3539
01:47:43.411 --> 01:47:44.250
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem,</v>

3540
01:47:44.670 --> 01:47:45.090
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3541
01:47:45.090 --> 01:47:46.230
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

3542
01:47:46.290 --> 01:47:46.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3543
01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:51.620
<v Speaker 3>so we wouldn't have the vibrant rabbits that Daniel has if we had started at the</v>

3544
01:47:52.501 --> 01:47:52.890
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>

3545
01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:53.131
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3546
01:47:53.131 --> 01:47:54.900
<v Speaker 3>let's properties up with antibiotics.</v>

3547
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:59.280
<v Speaker 3>So the weak ones can survive if everybody walks into the room wearing crutches.</v>

3548
01:48:00.090 --> 01:48:02.250
<v Speaker 3>You don't know who can stand on their own two feet.</v>

3549
01:48:02.730 --> 01:48:06.510
<v Speaker 3>It's only when you start knocking crutches out that you find out who can stand.</v>

3550
01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:08.910
<v Speaker 3>It's that anthropomorphizing,</v>

3551
01:48:08.911 --> 01:48:09.360
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

3552
01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:10.141
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

3553
01:48:10.141 --> 01:48:12.330
<v Speaker 3>Animals that we wanted.</v>

3554
01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:14.010
<v Speaker 3>We wouldn't do that with people.</v>

3555
01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:15.630
<v Speaker 3>Of course we wouldn't do it with people,</v>

3556
01:48:15.631 --> 01:48:15.900
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

3557
01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:20.520
<v Speaker 4>these are animals and this is the natural world and this is why animals survive</v>

3558
01:48:20.521 --> 01:48:21.870
<v Speaker 4>and if you don't do that,</v>

3559
01:48:21.871 --> 01:48:23.040
<v Speaker 4>they won't survive.</v>

3560
01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:27.960
<v Speaker 4>Then you'll have the weak ones breed and develop all sorts of huge issues which</v>

3561
01:48:27.961 --> 01:48:30.630
<v Speaker 4>could be argued essentially that that's happening with people,</v>

3562
01:48:30.631 --> 01:48:32.400
<v Speaker 4>but people have a lot of other things to offer.</v>

3563
01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:33.480
<v Speaker 4>Our innovation,</v>

3564
01:48:33.481 --> 01:48:37.620
<v Speaker 4>our creativity and our ability to communicate and our thinking,</v>

3565
01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:39.840
<v Speaker 4>our what makes us uniquely human.</v>

3566
01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:40.830
<v Speaker 4>The animals,</v>

3567
01:48:40.831 --> 01:48:41.210
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

3568
01:48:41.210 --> 01:48:43.230
<v Speaker 4>It's simply their body,</v>

3569
01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:44.250
<v Speaker 4>their life,</v>

3570
01:48:44.250 --> 01:48:44.511
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

3571
01:48:44.511 --> 01:48:46.890
<v Speaker 4>their existence and the way they interact with their knee,</v>

3572
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:47.783
<v Speaker 4>with nature.</v>

3573
01:48:47.950 --> 01:48:49.620
<v Speaker 4>When when you tamper with that,</v>

3574
01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:50.760
<v Speaker 4>when you tamper with that,</v>

3575
01:48:50.761 --> 01:48:50.951
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>

3576
01:48:50.951 --> 01:48:52.110
<v Speaker 4>You're essentially.</v>

3577
01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:56.160
<v Speaker 4>You're pretending you're smarter than nature itself and that's ridiculous.</v>

3578
01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:57.233
<v Speaker 4>We can't.</v>

3579
01:48:57.270 --> 01:49:01.530
<v Speaker 4>We can show real clearly by what you've said today about factory farming,</v>

3580
01:49:02.130 --> 01:49:06.120
<v Speaker 4>about the development of these diseases that we're not smarter than nature.</v>

3581
01:49:06.121 --> 01:49:07.570
<v Speaker 4>We don't and then we.</v>

3582
01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:12.270
<v Speaker 4>There's no one could know everything and there's not one person that's smart</v>

3583
01:49:12.271 --> 01:49:14.970
<v Speaker 4>enough to be able to see the whole big picture.</v>

3584
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:18.750
<v Speaker 4>We need a lot of other eyes on this and we need a lot of other thoughts on this</v>

3585
01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:24.080
<v Speaker 4>and when you start applying the same sort of compassion and that,</v>

3586
01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:27.960
<v Speaker 4>that we rightly due to human beings,</v>

3587
01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:29.220
<v Speaker 4>you start applying them to animals.</v>

3588
01:49:29.221 --> 01:49:30.940
<v Speaker 4>You actually wind up screwing the animals.</v>

3589
01:49:30.941 --> 01:49:31.100
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3590
01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:31.600
<v Speaker 4>All over.</v>

3591
01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:31.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3592
01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:32.331
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

3593
01:49:32.331 --> 01:49:35.140
<v Speaker 3>you create a artificial fragility.</v>

3594
01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:37.181
<v Speaker 3>No Sir.</v>

3595
01:49:37.181 --> 01:49:37.901
<v Speaker 3>Albert Howard,</v>

3596
01:49:37.901 --> 01:49:38.501
<v Speaker 3>who of course,</v>

3597
01:49:38.501 --> 01:49:39.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3598
01:49:39.110 --> 01:49:42.850
<v Speaker 3>develop the scientific aerobic composting process in which it,</v>

3599
01:49:42.930 --> 01:49:46.150
<v Speaker 3>his book is still kind of the icon of the whole sustainable agriculture</v>

3600
01:49:46.151 --> 01:49:46.984
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

3601
01:49:47.230 --> 01:49:50.590
<v Speaker 3>It was written in 1943 and agricultural testament.</v>

3602
01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:53.080
<v Speaker 3>He says in there that when you,</v>

3603
01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:57.860
<v Speaker 3>when you use artificial artificial matures in the soil and that's what he called</v>

3604
01:49:57.861 --> 01:49:58.840
<v Speaker 3>a chemical fertilizers,</v>

3605
01:49:58.841 --> 01:49:59.830
<v Speaker 3>artificial manures.</v>

3606
01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:04.210
<v Speaker 3>It makes grows artificial plants which make artificial animals,</v>

3607
01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:09.490
<v Speaker 3>which then make artificial people who can only stay alive using artificials.</v>

3608
01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.830
<v Speaker 3>That was in 1943.</v>

3609
01:50:12.130 --> 01:50:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3610
01:50:12.890 --> 01:50:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't that present?</v>

3611
01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:14.801
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3612
01:50:14.801 --> 01:50:15.850
<v Speaker 3>That comes on the ball.</v>

3613
01:50:16.190 --> 01:50:17.560
<v Speaker 3>That was just coming out.</v>

3614
01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:18.461
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3615
01:50:18.461 --> 01:50:20.780
<v Speaker 3>how long had factory farming even been around that?</v>

3616
01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:22.120
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>

3617
01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:23.290
<v Speaker 3>and we were just,</v>

3618
01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:24.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was 19,</v>

3619
01:50:24.641 --> 01:50:25.460
<v Speaker 3>43.</v>

3620
01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:29.890
<v Speaker 3>We were just really beginning to start using chemical fertilizers at that point.</v>

3621
01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:34.850
<v Speaker 4>Now when they have the issue with large scale agriculture,</v>

3622
01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:38.540
<v Speaker 4>when they chew up all the minerals in the ground and they have to add minerals</v>

3623
01:50:38.541 --> 01:50:41.730
<v Speaker 4>when they'd go over the top soil of American farmlands.</v>

3624
01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:41.931
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3625
01:50:41.931 --> 01:50:42.101
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3626
01:50:42.101 --> 01:50:44.510
<v Speaker 4>there was a paper that was written about it.</v>

3627
01:50:44.570 --> 01:50:44.860
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

3628
01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:45.830
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember the year,</v>

3629
01:50:45.831 --> 01:50:47.120
<v Speaker 4>but it was a long time ago,</v>

3630
01:50:47.121 --> 01:50:48.860
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was in the 19 forties,</v>

3631
01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:51.320
<v Speaker 4>about the mineral deficiencies of topsoil,</v>

3632
01:50:51.370 --> 01:50:52.290
<v Speaker 4>of topsoil.</v>

3633
01:50:53.010 --> 01:50:53.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3634
01:50:53.490 --> 01:50:53.860
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

3635
01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:55.460
<v Speaker 4>what do they do about that now?</v>

3636
01:50:55.461 --> 01:50:55.821
<v Speaker 4>And it,</v>

3637
01:50:55.821 --> 01:50:58.500
<v Speaker 4>does that same issue still happen?</v>

3638
01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.540
<v Speaker 4>A farm like yours?</v>

3639
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:00.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3640
01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:00.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3641
01:51:00.610 --> 01:51:01.061
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

3642
01:51:01.061 --> 01:51:01.811
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

3643
01:51:01.811 --> 01:51:02.081
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3644
01:51:02.081 --> 01:51:03.400
<v Speaker 3>mineral deficiency is a,</v>

3645
01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:04.900
<v Speaker 3>is a major problem in nature.</v>

3646
01:51:04.901 --> 01:51:08.740
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately a nature has a mechanism to remedy it.</v>

3647
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:10.263
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3648
01:51:10.590 --> 01:51:10.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3649
01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:14.980
<v Speaker 3>amazingly it's onsite doesn't need a bunch of stuff brought in.</v>

3650
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:19.240
<v Speaker 3>And the way nature remedies is with an act of decomposition cycle,</v>

3651
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:23.470
<v Speaker 3>the way it works is when organic matter decomposes into the soil,</v>

3652
01:51:24.850 --> 01:51:25.720
<v Speaker 3>it gives off,</v>

3653
01:51:25.721 --> 01:51:28.750
<v Speaker 3>it exudes carbon dioxide when things rot,</v>

3654
01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:30.430
<v Speaker 3>they give off carbon dioxide.</v>

3655
01:51:32.050 --> 01:51:33.870
<v Speaker 3>And so that carbon dioxide as it,</v>

3656
01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:37.180
<v Speaker 3>as it percolates up through the pores in the soil,</v>

3657
01:51:37.230 --> 01:51:37.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3658
01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:39.010
<v Speaker 3>the aggregates in the soil.</v>

3659
01:51:39.310 --> 01:51:41.800
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the soil and an electron microscope,</v>

3660
01:51:42.010 --> 01:51:43.660
<v Speaker 3>it really looks like a marsh,</v>

3661
01:51:44.490 --> 01:51:44.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3662
01:51:44.810 --> 01:51:49.450
<v Speaker 3>there's all these little cavities and aggregates and moisture and all these,</v>

3663
01:51:49.770 --> 01:51:50.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3664
01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:52.150
<v Speaker 3>slogging weird looking,</v>

3665
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:52.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3666
01:51:52.541 --> 01:51:57.460
<v Speaker 3>bugs and cal looking things and predators and herbivores.</v>

3667
01:51:57.461 --> 01:51:58.010
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3668
01:51:58.010 --> 01:51:58.261
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3669
01:51:58.261 --> 01:51:58.480
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3670
01:51:58.480 --> 01:51:59.080
<v Speaker 3>it's an entire,</v>

3671
01:51:59.080 --> 01:51:59.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3672
01:51:59.260 --> 01:51:59.660
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3673
01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:03.790
<v Speaker 3>there are more living beings and a double handful of healthy soil than there are</v>

3674
01:52:03.791 --> 01:52:04.930
<v Speaker 3>people on the face of the earth.</v>

3675
01:52:05.170 --> 01:52:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

3676
01:52:05.850 --> 01:52:06.190
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

3677
01:52:06.190 --> 01:52:07.630
<v Speaker 3>that's how alive it is.</v>

3678
01:52:08.970 --> 01:52:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3679
01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:10.660
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3680
01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:11.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3681
01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:11.650
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3682
01:52:11.650 --> 01:52:12.820
<v Speaker 3>so when that,</v>

3683
01:52:12.850 --> 01:52:13.630
<v Speaker 3>when that car,</v>

3684
01:52:13.630 --> 01:52:17.950
<v Speaker 3>when that carbon dioxide eases up through the,</v>

3685
01:52:18.010 --> 01:52:20.230
<v Speaker 3>through the aggregates in this,</v>

3686
01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:22.330
<v Speaker 3>in this kind of marshy soil,</v>

3687
01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:24.640
<v Speaker 3>it encounters h,</v>

3688
01:52:24.641 --> 01:52:25.960
<v Speaker 3>two o water,</v>

3689
01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:26.560
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>

3690
01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.550
<v Speaker 3>in those aggregates.</v>

3691
01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:29.650
<v Speaker 3>And when the CEO,</v>

3692
01:52:29.651 --> 01:52:31.150
<v Speaker 3>two hits H,</v>

3693
01:52:31.151 --> 01:52:34.360
<v Speaker 3>two o it makes carbonic acid.</v>

3694
01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:35.561
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

3695
01:52:35.561 --> 01:52:36.760
<v Speaker 3>carbonic acid.</v>

3696
01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:38.193
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3697
01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:39.060
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

3698
01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:39.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3699
01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:39.950
<v Speaker 3>if we took,</v>

3700
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:44.950
<v Speaker 3>if we said that this is a rock right here and we want to find out how much zinc,</v>

3701
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:46.430
<v Speaker 3>cobalt,</v>

3702
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:47.270
<v Speaker 3>molybdenum,</v>

3703
01:52:48.570 --> 01:52:49.910
<v Speaker 3>no aluminum,</v>

3704
01:52:49.911 --> 01:52:51.380
<v Speaker 3>whatever is in this rock,</v>

3705
01:52:51.650 --> 01:52:54.290
<v Speaker 3>we could treat it with lots of reagents.</v>

3706
01:52:54.291 --> 01:52:55.760
<v Speaker 3>We could use sulfuric acid,</v>

3707
01:52:55.761 --> 01:52:56.810
<v Speaker 3>hydrochloric acid,</v>

3708
01:52:56.811 --> 01:52:56.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3709
01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:58.280
<v Speaker 3>we could use lots of different acids.</v>

3710
01:52:59.090 --> 01:53:03.170
<v Speaker 3>Guess which one is the most efficient asset to use?</v>

3711
01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Carbonic acid.</v>

3712
01:53:06.170 --> 01:53:06.501
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3713
01:53:06.501 --> 01:53:07.430
<v Speaker 3>so nature,</v>

3714
01:53:07.450 --> 01:53:07.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3715
01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:08.050
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3716
01:53:08.050 --> 01:53:13.050
<v Speaker 3>so creation has this wonderful ability if there is,</v>

3717
01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:16.460
<v Speaker 3>if there is carbon decomposing in the soil</v>

3718
01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:19.500
<v Speaker 3>and moisture,</v>

3719
01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:24.980
<v Speaker 3>that creates a carbonic acid to break out the minerals that are in the parent</v>

3720
01:53:26.131 --> 01:53:27.540
<v Speaker 3>rock material in the soil.</v>

3721
01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:28.410
<v Speaker 3>If I went out,</v>

3722
01:53:28.410 --> 01:53:32.820
<v Speaker 3>if I went outside the studio here and picked up a rock and brought it in and</v>

3723
01:53:32.821 --> 01:53:33.654
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

3724
01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:34.793
<v Speaker 3>is that rock?</v>

3725
01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:36.590
<v Speaker 3>Does it contain the same minerals?</v>

3726
01:53:36.591 --> 01:53:36.990
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

3727
01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:37.350
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>

3728
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:41.160
<v Speaker 3>is it the same thing as it was 2000 years ago?</v>

3729
01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:42.060
<v Speaker 3>You'd say yes.</v>

3730
01:53:42.150 --> 01:53:43.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the rock.</v>

3731
01:53:43.351 --> 01:53:44.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

3732
01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:44.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3733
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:45.570
<v Speaker 3>there's not a big hole through it.</v>

3734
01:53:45.571 --> 01:53:45.751
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3735
01:53:45.751 --> 01:53:46.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3736
01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:46.380
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3737
01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:47.213
<v Speaker 3>that's the way it was.</v>

3738
01:53:48.230 --> 01:53:48.570
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3739
01:53:48.570 --> 01:53:51.930
<v Speaker 3>and so we have plenty of parent mineral in,</v>

3740
01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:52.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3741
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:53.783
<v Speaker 3>out here.</v>

3742
01:53:53.970 --> 01:53:57.420
<v Speaker 3>The problem is we don't have an active decomposition cycle.</v>

3743
01:53:58.560 --> 01:53:59.790
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>

3744
01:53:59.970 --> 01:54:04.050
<v Speaker 3>how do you destroy a decomposition cycle?</v>

3745
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:09.470
<v Speaker 3>You do it when you don't feed this when you don't have a carbon,</v>

3746
01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:11.760
<v Speaker 3>a carbon centric system.</v>

3747
01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:17.360
<v Speaker 3>And everything about modern farming is trying to get rid of carbon.</v>

3748
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:19.210
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

3749
01:54:19.210 --> 01:54:21.180
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the things that we're looking at.</v>

3750
01:54:21.181 --> 01:54:23.100
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if you've read the book called Wheat Belly,</v>

3751
01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:25.073
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3752
01:54:25.470 --> 01:54:25.880
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

3753
01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:26.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3754
01:54:26.131 --> 01:54:26.860
<v Speaker 3>gluten and,</v>

3755
01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:31.860
<v Speaker 3>and those sorts of things is that you used to be a win.</v>

3756
01:54:31.921 --> 01:54:33.510
<v Speaker 3>Our grand puppies,</v>

3757
01:54:33.511 --> 01:54:35.610
<v Speaker 3>we're planting wheat.</v>

3758
01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Wheat would grow,</v>

3759
01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:38.290
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3760
01:54:38.290 --> 01:54:38.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3761
01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:39.690
<v Speaker 3>six feet tall.</v>

3762
01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:40.381
<v Speaker 3>It was real,</v>

3763
01:54:40.381 --> 01:54:42.180
<v Speaker 3>real tall so that the,</v>

3764
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:46.400
<v Speaker 3>the grain to stem ratio was whatever it was,</v>

3765
01:54:46.401 --> 01:54:46.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3766
01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:47.393
<v Speaker 3>the ratio.</v>

3767
01:54:47.670 --> 01:54:48.503
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3768
01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:51.720
<v Speaker 3>the taller the wheat,</v>

3769
01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:53.370
<v Speaker 3>the taller the stalk,</v>

3770
01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:57.000
<v Speaker 3>the less weight it can hold out there,</v>

3771
01:54:57.001 --> 01:54:57.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3772
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.571
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3773
01:54:57.571 --> 01:54:58.950
<v Speaker 3>it wants to fall over,</v>

3774
01:54:58.951 --> 01:54:59.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3775
01:54:59.151 --> 01:54:59.984
<v Speaker 3>because you go,</v>

3776
01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:01.710
<v Speaker 3>the skyscraper gets taller and Taller,</v>

3777
01:55:01.711 --> 01:55:02.544
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3778
01:55:02.670 --> 01:55:05.700
<v Speaker 3>And so in genetics and genetic breeding and selection,</v>

3779
01:55:05.701 --> 01:55:09.370
<v Speaker 3>what we've done in the last 50 years is shortened,</v>

3780
01:55:10.110 --> 01:55:14.790
<v Speaker 3>is selected shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter cultivars down to where</v>

3781
01:55:14.791 --> 01:55:18.570
<v Speaker 3>it's a very short stem and that ratio has fundamentally changed,</v>

3782
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:23.870
<v Speaker 3>which also affects the enzymes and the nutrient components of those seed heads.</v>

3783
01:55:24.810 --> 01:55:29.810
<v Speaker 3>But we can combine it faster and we can grow a bigger head on a smaller plant.</v>

3784
01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:31.590
<v Speaker 3>But guess what we also did,</v>

3785
01:55:31.710 --> 01:55:36.710
<v Speaker 3>we also deprived the soil of the carbon that the straw and the stock would</v>

3786
01:55:37.981 --> 01:55:42.981
<v Speaker 3>produce from a given amount of grain that deprive the soil of the carbon</v>

3787
01:55:44.011 --> 01:55:48.060
<v Speaker 3>injection that was supposed to come when we took the grain head off.</v>

3788
01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:53.340
<v Speaker 3>And now we don't have that carbon decomposition cycle.</v>

3789
01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:54.700
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3790
01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:58.450
<v Speaker 4>And so the solution to that in the industrial way,</v>

3791
01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:59.830
<v Speaker 4>it's just admin</v>

3792
01:56:01.370 --> 01:56:02.580
<v Speaker 4>admin or you know,</v>

3793
01:56:02.650 --> 01:56:05.170
<v Speaker 4>mine mineral somewhere else and,</v>

3794
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:06.240
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

3795
01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:07.073
<v Speaker 4>and add them.</v>

3796
01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:09.160
<v Speaker 4>But all that can be done in house.</v>

3797
01:56:09.610 --> 01:56:11.410
<v Speaker 4>It can absolutely can all be done in house.</v>

3798
01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:12.830
<v Speaker 4>The wheat issue is,</v>

3799
01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:15.760
<v Speaker 4>is a big one with the Americans today.</v>

3800
01:56:15.970 --> 01:56:19.570
<v Speaker 4>Everyone wants to be gluten free and I'm guilty of it too.</v>

3801
01:56:19.571 --> 01:56:24.220
<v Speaker 4>I stopped eating gluten reading recently and I found that almost immediately,</v>

3802
01:56:24.221 --> 01:56:25.690
<v Speaker 4>like I felt more,</v>

3803
01:56:26.770 --> 01:56:29.800
<v Speaker 4>I felt less bloated after a meal,</v>

3804
01:56:29.801 --> 01:56:30.530
<v Speaker 4>if that's a good term,</v>

3805
01:56:30.530 --> 01:56:32.410
<v Speaker 4>less dated after a meal.</v>

3806
01:56:32.590 --> 01:56:32.891
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

3807
01:56:32.891 --> 01:56:34.210
<v Speaker 4>I didn't feel so tired.</v>

3808
01:56:34.570 --> 01:56:35.403
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3809
01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:37.050
<v Speaker 4>when I started reading about it,</v>

3810
01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:40.870
<v Speaker 4>I read that when we had been changed to,</v>

3811
01:56:40.871 --> 01:56:41.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3812
01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:42.910
<v Speaker 4>to change the size of it,</v>

3813
01:56:42.911 --> 01:56:44.080
<v Speaker 4>to make it more hardy,</v>

3814
01:56:44.380 --> 01:56:47.110
<v Speaker 4>it also became more difficult to digest.</v>

3815
01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:48.010
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3816
01:56:48.010 --> 01:56:48.761
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

3817
01:56:48.761 --> 01:56:50.680
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible to get that old wheat back?</v>

3818
01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:51.251
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

3819
01:56:51.251 --> 01:56:52.720

3820
01:56:52.721 --> 01:56:52.971

3839
01:57:08.431 --> 01:57:11.700
<v Speaker 3>you can have your own flour mill if you want to buy it by the bag.</v>

3840
01:57:11.701 --> 01:57:12.960
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like a pain in the ass,</v>

3849
01:57:30.181 --> 01:57:30.900
<v Speaker 3>movement?</v>

3895
01:58:33.050 --> 01:58:33.883
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

3896
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:35.480
<v Speaker 4>That's so true.</v>

3897

<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3900
01:58:36.921 --> 01:58:39.740
<v Speaker 4>that's the big knock on organic food,</v>

3901

01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:40.791
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3904
01:58:40.791 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 4>most people don't have the money</v>

3905
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:44.150
<v Speaker 3>to go to whole foods or oral,</v>

3906
01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:46.150
<v Speaker 3>that'd be addressed the money.</v>

3907
01:58:46.151 --> 01:58:49.510
<v Speaker 3>The way to address the money is to eat whole foods,</v>

3908
01:58:49.511 --> 01:58:50.740
<v Speaker 3>not processed foods.</v>

01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:59.020
<v Speaker 3>as a powerful movie a very profound.</v>

3914
01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:01.560
<v Speaker 3>But there's A real weakness in that movie where that,</v>

3915
01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:01.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3916
01:59:01.721 --> 01:59:04.210
<v Speaker 3>that family that goes to burger king and they bow that,</v>

3917
01:59:04.211 --> 01:59:04.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3918
01:59:04.331 --> 01:59:07.380
<v Speaker 3>they buy a whopper or whatever they get and they buy a it look,</v>

3919
01:59:07.420 --> 01:59:07.931
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a,</v>

3920
01:59:07.931 --> 01:59:08.111
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

3921
01:59:08.111 --> 01:59:08.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3922
01:59:08.330 --> 01:59:10.180
<v Speaker 3>200 outside soft drink,</v>

3923
01:59:10.181 --> 01:59:10.541
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3924
01:59:10.541 --> 01:59:11.141
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

3925
01:59:11.141 --> 01:59:13.570
<v Speaker 3>it's a big one and french fries.</v>

3926
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:18.010
<v Speaker 3>And then they say they can't afford to buy produce vegetables.</v>

3927
01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:22.000
<v Speaker 3>The fact is that meal,</v>

3928
01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:22.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3929
01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:23.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3930
01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:23.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3931
01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:24.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat at burger king,</v>

3932
01:59:24.461 --> 01:59:25.294
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

3933
01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:26.133
<v Speaker 3>they're all the same.</v>

3934
01:59:26.430 --> 01:59:27.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3935
01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:32.040
<v Speaker 3>that meal costs no more than two whole pounds of our polyface grass fattened</v>

3936
01:59:35.531 --> 01:59:38.740
<v Speaker 3>grass finished worldclass ground beef.</v>

3937
01:59:39.430 --> 01:59:44.170
<v Speaker 3>And there's more nutrition in half a pound of my ground beef than there is in</v>

3938
01:59:44.171 --> 01:59:47.740
<v Speaker 3>that entire meal fast food meal.</v>

3939
01:59:48.670 --> 01:59:50.710
<v Speaker 3>So when somebody says they can't afford it,</v>

3940
01:59:51.610 --> 01:59:53.500
<v Speaker 3>the first thing I do is I want to grab him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>let's go to your house and here's what.</v>

3944
01:59:55.721 --> 01:59:56.381

3945
01:59:56.381 --> 01:59:59.290
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to find any fast food boxes or fast food receipts.</v>

3946
01:59:59.530 --> 02:00:01.090
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to find soda,</v>

3947

<v Speaker 3>alcohol,</v>

3948
02:00:02.590 --> 02:00:03.430
<v Speaker 3>tobacco,</v>

3949
02:00:03.730 --> 02:00:04.563
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>

3950
02:00:05.170 --> 02:00:06.520
<v Speaker 3>widescreen tvs.</v>

3951
02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:10.180
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to find $100 designer jeans with holes already in the knees.</v>

3952
02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:14.140
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to find a know netflix,</v>

3953
02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:15.310
<v Speaker 3>people magazine,</v>

3954
02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:16.630
<v Speaker 3>you name your thing.</v>

3955
02:00:16.631 --> 02:00:16.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3956
02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:17.141
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3957
02:00:17.141 --> 02:00:17.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3958
02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:19.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm a lottery tickets.</v>

3959
02:00:19.901 --> 02:00:20.734
<v Speaker 3>That's a big one.</v>

3960
02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:21.873
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

3961
02:00:22.450 --> 02:00:26.290
<v Speaker 3>You show me the house that doesn't have any of those things.</v>

3962
02:00:26.830 --> 02:00:28.360
<v Speaker 3>And then let's talk about price.</v>

3963
02:00:28.810 --> 02:00:30.550
<v Speaker 3>Talk about what you actually can afford.</v>

3964
02:00:30.650 --> 02:00:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Talk about what you want to you.</v>

3965
02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:32.313
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

3966
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:37.390
<v Speaker 3>because my position is we choose even even 95 percent of poor people still have</v>

3967
02:00:40.571 --> 02:00:41.530
<v Speaker 3>most of those things.</v>

3968
02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:44.230
<v Speaker 3>We choose what we're willing to buy.</v>

3969
02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:47.680
<v Speaker 3>You can buy wheat by the bushel,</v>

3970
02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:48.933
<v Speaker 3>you can make,</v>

3971
02:00:49.090 --> 02:00:54.090
<v Speaker 3>you can make $800 worth of bread from a $6 bushel of wheat.</v>

3972
02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:59.380
<v Speaker 3>What it means is you have to participate in the food system.</v>

3973
02:00:59.970 --> 02:01:00.700
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

3974
02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:04.360
<v Speaker 3>this is our proBlem is not that it's not available or we can't get it or we</v>

3975
02:01:04.361 --> 02:01:05.350
<v Speaker 3>don't know what to do.</v>

3976
02:01:05.590 --> 02:01:07.390
<v Speaker 3>Our problem is that we want convenience.</v>

3977
02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:08.560
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to have to think.</v>

3978
02:01:08.561 --> 02:01:09.310
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to.</v>

3979
02:01:09.310 --> 02:01:10.720
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to have to plan ahead.</v>

3980
02:01:10.721 --> 02:01:12.640
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to want to plan menus.</v>

3981
02:01:12.641 --> 02:01:13.130
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

3982
02:01:13.130 --> 02:01:18.130
<v Speaker 3>we want to just a convenient spontaneity and you cannot have an integrity</v>

3983
02:01:19.361 --> 02:01:21.580
<v Speaker 3>economic sector of anything.</v>

3984
02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:22.473
<v Speaker 3>Automobiles,</v>

3985
02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:23.080
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>

3986
02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:23.860
<v Speaker 3>clothes,</v>

3987
02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:24.693
<v Speaker 3>entertainment.</v>

3988
02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:26.950
<v Speaker 3>You cannot have an integrity,</v>

3989
02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:32.100
<v Speaker 3>economic sector of anything when you so profoundly abdicate personal</v>

3990
02:01:32.771 --> 02:01:34.840
<v Speaker 3>participation in that economic sector.</v>

3991
02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:38.590
<v Speaker 3>It is more expensive when you go to a supermarket and you buy organic</v>

3992
02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:39.290
<v Speaker 3>vegetables.</v>

3993
02:01:39.290 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3994
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:40.161
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3995
02:01:40.161 --> 02:01:40.994
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

3996
02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:41.451
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

3997
02:01:41.451 --> 02:01:42.350
<v Speaker 3>And some of the better.</v>

3998
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:43.603
<v Speaker 3>They are better.</v>

3999
02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4000
02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Are they better scientific?</v>

4001
02:01:46.090 --> 02:01:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4002
02:01:46.890 --> 02:01:47.723
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

4003
02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:48.190
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

4004
02:01:48.190 --> 02:01:49.023
<v Speaker 3>let me say this.</v>

4005
02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:50.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

4006
02:01:50.850 --> 02:01:52.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get,</v>

4007
02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:52.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4008
02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:53.500
<v Speaker 3>crossways of,</v>

4009
02:01:53.570 --> 02:01:54.403
<v Speaker 3>of every.</v>

4010
02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:54.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4011
02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:55.681
<v Speaker 3>I guess I might as well.</v>

4012
02:01:55.681 --> 02:01:57.530
<v Speaker 3>I might as well get crossways with everything out there.</v>

4013
02:01:57.810 --> 02:01:58.643
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4014
02:01:58.740 --> 02:01:59.750
<v Speaker 3>in my view,</v>

4015
02:01:59.870 --> 02:02:00.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4016
02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:02.060
<v Speaker 3>we should just not eat from the supermarket.</v>

4017
02:02:03.930 --> 02:02:04.900
<v Speaker 3>Don't eat from superman.</v>

4018
02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:05.540
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4019
02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Where do you get your food?</v>

4020
02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4021
02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:07.710
<v Speaker 3>you get it.</v>

4022
02:02:07.710 --> 02:02:09.540
<v Speaker 3>You get it from farmer's market.</v>

4023
02:02:09.541 --> 02:02:11.650
<v Speaker 3>You get it from a community supported agriculture,</v>

4024
02:02:11.710 --> 02:02:14.730
<v Speaker 3>food buying club of metropolitan food club.</v>

4025
02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:17.580
<v Speaker 3>You go to go to farmers,</v>

4026
02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:19.080
<v Speaker 3>buy bulk.</v>

4027
02:02:19.410 --> 02:02:23.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean the way to deal with the prices by it unprocessed and by volume,</v>

4028
02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:27.440
<v Speaker 3>which means that you have to recreate your domestic larder.</v>

4029
02:02:27.450 --> 02:02:27.601
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4030
02:02:27.601 --> 02:02:29.070
<v Speaker 3>we don't even use that word anymore.</v>

4031
02:02:29.071 --> 02:02:29.904
<v Speaker 3>Larder,</v>

4032
02:02:30.070 --> 02:02:31.320
<v Speaker 3>who's ever heard that word,</v>

4033
02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:33.750
<v Speaker 3>but that's where all the food was eight years ago.</v>

4034
02:02:33.751 --> 02:02:36.330
<v Speaker 3>If I came to la and said,</v>

4035
02:02:36.331 --> 02:02:37.440
<v Speaker 3>where's the food in la?</v>

4036
02:02:37.441 --> 02:02:38.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not in a warehouse.</v>

4037
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:41.610
<v Speaker 3>It would be an individual larders in houses.</v>

4038
02:02:42.090 --> 02:02:45.300
<v Speaker 3>And so when you buy in bulk</v>

4039
02:02:46.830 --> 02:02:51.830
<v Speaker 3>and you buy unprocessed and you put your sweat equity into preparing,</v>

4040
02:02:54.181 --> 02:02:54.871
<v Speaker 3>processing,</v>

4041
02:02:54.871 --> 02:02:56.700
<v Speaker 3>preserving and packaging,</v>

4042
02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:02.400
<v Speaker 3>then you can actually save money over the process counterpart.</v>

4043
02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:04.343
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

4044
02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:05.340
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

4045
02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:06.300
<v Speaker 3>you can get,</v>

4046
02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:08.190
<v Speaker 3>you can get top of the line.</v>

4047
02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:11.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm a local,</v>

4048
02:03:11.730 --> 02:03:16.730
<v Speaker 3>the best stuff in the world that's cheaper than the processed stuff in the</v>

4049
02:03:17.551 --> 02:03:18.384
<v Speaker 3>supermarket.</v>

4050
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:19.410
<v Speaker 3>I went to,</v>

4051
02:03:19.490 --> 02:03:20.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4052
02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:21.780
<v Speaker 3>the green markets in New York city,</v>

4053
02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:24.960
<v Speaker 3>arguably the most expensive farmer's market in the country.</v>

4054
02:03:25.230 --> 02:03:26.250
<v Speaker 3>I asked my hostess,</v>

4055
02:03:26.251 --> 02:03:26.970
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

4056
02:03:26.970 --> 02:03:27.930
<v Speaker 3>would you do something for me?</v>

4057
02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Could you take me to the vendor with the most expensive potato in America?</v>

4058
02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:33.290
<v Speaker 3>So she,</v>

4059
02:03:33.290 --> 02:03:33.380
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4060
02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:34.580
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly who we needed to go to.</v>

4061
02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:38.460
<v Speaker 3>So we went down to the stalls there and there was a vendor there that had about</v>

4062
02:03:38.461 --> 02:03:40.170
<v Speaker 3>20 varieties of potatoes.</v>

4063
02:03:40.290 --> 02:03:40.891
<v Speaker 3>They were beautiful.</v>

4064
02:03:40.891 --> 02:03:42.150
<v Speaker 3>He had them in little little,</v>

4065
02:03:42.151 --> 02:03:42.291
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4066
02:03:42.291 --> 02:03:43.124
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4067
02:03:43.140 --> 02:03:46.470
<v Speaker 3>box cubbies known as beautiful wooden slanted display.</v>

4068
02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:49.290
<v Speaker 3>There were red ones and yellow ones and green ones and blue ones and all this.</v>

4069
02:03:49.530 --> 02:03:51.960
<v Speaker 3>So I looked through the boxes and I found the most expensive one.</v>

4070
02:03:51.961 --> 02:03:52.680
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

4071
02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:54.240
<v Speaker 3>it was a little a heirloom,</v>

4072
02:03:54.241 --> 02:03:59.241
<v Speaker 3>peruvian blue fingerling potatoes for $2 a pound.</v>

4073
02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:00.750
<v Speaker 3>That's expensive for a potato.</v>

4074
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:02.160
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

4075
02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:02.993
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

4076
02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:04.980
<v Speaker 3>you know where most potatoes,</v>

4077
02:04:05.010 --> 02:04:07.530
<v Speaker 3>how much space was being sold in New York city.</v>

4078
02:04:08.730 --> 02:04:10.890
<v Speaker 3>$4 a pound as potato chips.</v>

4079
02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:12.473
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

4080
02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:14.580
<v Speaker 3>We've got queensland arch,</v>

4081
02:04:14.581 --> 02:04:15.570
<v Speaker 3>we've got slicers,</v>

4082
02:04:15.571 --> 02:04:16.091
<v Speaker 3>deisseroth,</v>

4083
02:04:16.091 --> 02:04:16.980
<v Speaker 3>and fry babies.</v>

4084
02:04:19.500 --> 02:04:24.300
<v Speaker 3>You can get the most expensive potato in America and it's half the price to</v>

4085
02:04:24.301 --> 02:04:25.134
<v Speaker 3>potato chips.</v>

4086
02:04:25.170 --> 02:04:26.700
<v Speaker 3>Potato chips is not food.</v>

4087
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:27.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is,</v>

4088
02:04:27.721 --> 02:04:28.411
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

4089
02:04:28.411 --> 02:04:33.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a snack and people pay for convenience and you get a real honest to</v>

4090
02:04:33.181 --> 02:04:37.080
<v Speaker 3>goodness potato and slice it yourself and fried in lard.</v>

4091
02:04:37.170 --> 02:04:38.003
<v Speaker 3>A frog baby.</v>

4092
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:38.940
<v Speaker 3>That is food.</v>

4093
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:39.741
<v Speaker 4>It is food.</v>

4094
02:04:39.741 --> 02:04:41.720
<v Speaker 4>But what I'm saying is most people when they get it,</v>

4095
02:04:41.721 --> 02:04:44.090
<v Speaker 4>they get it as a snack and they don't have the time.</v>

4096
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:46.160
<v Speaker 4>When someone buys a bag of chips,</v>

4097
02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:49.970
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to go to the store and get a potato and slice it.</v>

4098
02:04:49.971 --> 02:04:52.850
<v Speaker 4>And in this modern world that we live in,</v>

4099
02:04:52.851 --> 02:04:54.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying I know in this modern world,</v>

4100
02:04:54.980 --> 02:04:58.690
<v Speaker 4>so we should essentially go direct to farmers and go to farmer's markets</v>

4101
02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:00.620
<v Speaker 4>whenever possible and you save a ton of money,</v>

4102
02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:01.710
<v Speaker 3>save a ton of money.</v>

4103
02:05:01.890 --> 02:05:03.030
<v Speaker 3>Mother earth news.</v>

4104
02:05:03.031 --> 02:05:05.610
<v Speaker 3>This issue actually has a,</v>

4105
02:05:05.611 --> 02:05:06.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4106
02:05:06.100 --> 02:05:09.120
<v Speaker 3>a big spreadsheet where they did exactly that.</v>

4107
02:05:09.121 --> 02:05:14.121
<v Speaker 3>They have a whole bunch of items that they bought at the supermarket,</v>

4108
02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:15.630
<v Speaker 3>at the farmer's market.</v>

4109
02:05:15.631 --> 02:05:15.820
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4110
02:05:15.820 --> 02:05:16.130
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4111
02:05:16.130 --> 02:05:16.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4112
02:05:16.890 --> 02:05:18.270
<v Speaker 3>I guess csh or something.</v>

4113
02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

4114
02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:20.490
<v Speaker 3>it is profound.</v>

4115
02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:24.180
<v Speaker 3>The savings going direct to farmers,</v>

4116
02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:25.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4117
02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:25.853
<v Speaker 3>can create.</v>

4118
02:05:26.130 --> 02:05:29.100
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing and buying volume and,</v>

4119
02:05:29.101 --> 02:05:29.934
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4120
02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:30.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4121
02:05:30.410 --> 02:05:31.200
<v Speaker 3>and taking,</v>

4122
02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:32.550
<v Speaker 3>taking the middleman out of it.</v>

4123
02:05:32.610 --> 02:05:33.443
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

4124
02:05:33.650 --> 02:05:38.650
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible with your methods and the way that you're describing a farming</v>

4125
02:05:38.841 --> 02:05:40.490
<v Speaker 4>and what you've done with your farm,</v>

4126
02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:42.950
<v Speaker 4>is it possible to feed this entire country that way?</v>

4127
02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:43.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4128
02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:44.451
<v Speaker 3>no question.</v>

4129
02:05:44.451 --> 02:05:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Not only is it,</v>

4130
02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:46.310
<v Speaker 3>is it possible?</v>

4131
02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:51.460
<v Speaker 3>It's actually the only regenerative way to do it because when you break apart</v>

4132
02:05:53.230 --> 02:05:53.990
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4133
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:56.450
<v Speaker 3>when you break apart the feed from the animal,</v>

4134
02:05:56.451 --> 02:05:57.410
<v Speaker 3>from the manure,</v>

4135
02:05:58.580 --> 02:06:01.910
<v Speaker 3>and we could even include people in that as well when you break all those,</v>

4136
02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:02.630
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

4137
02:06:02.630 --> 02:06:07.630
<v Speaker 3>those that are supposed to be a synergistic blessings when you break them apart,</v>

4138
02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:14.390
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing floats on a counterfeit,</v>

4139
02:06:14.990 --> 02:06:15.890
<v Speaker 3>cheap energy,</v>

4140
02:06:16.490 --> 02:06:17.360
<v Speaker 3>cheap oil</v>

4141
02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:19.693
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

4142
02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:21.133
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

4143
02:06:21.150 --> 02:06:24.950
<v Speaker 3>a fragile house of cards that depends on,</v>

4144
02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:26.193
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4145
02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:28.110
<v Speaker 3>clever pharmaceuticals staying,</v>

4146
02:06:28.230 --> 02:06:28.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4147
02:06:28.700 --> 02:06:30.440
<v Speaker 3>one mutation ahead of the,</v>

4148
02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:32.950
<v Speaker 3>of the mutating bugs to,</v>

4149
02:06:33.110 --> 02:06:33.390
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

4150
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:33.700
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

4151
02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:34.533
<v Speaker 3>to function.</v>

4152
02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:39.550
<v Speaker 4>So the argument against what you're prescribing in describing is that what you</v>

4153
02:06:40.041 --> 02:06:42.970
<v Speaker 4>have is sort of a,</v>

4154
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:43.570
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

4155
02:06:43.570 --> 02:06:48.570
<v Speaker 4>a beautiful small business model for creating a very ethical farm and raising</v>

4156
02:06:51.591 --> 02:06:52.970
<v Speaker 4>animals in a very nice way,</v>

4157
02:06:52.971 --> 02:06:56.720
<v Speaker 4>but it's impractical when you're talking about feeding a nation of 300 million</v>

4158
02:06:56.721 --> 02:06:57.350
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

4159
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.950
<v Speaker 4>but when,</v>

4160
02:06:57.950 --> 02:07:02.950
<v Speaker 4>but you're saying that not just the fact that you factor in when you farm your</v>

4161
02:07:04.751 --> 02:07:05.230
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

4162
02:07:05.230 --> 02:07:10.230
<v Speaker 4>the lack of sort of invisible costs that you get with factory farming,</v>

4163
02:07:11.230 --> 02:07:15.400
<v Speaker 4>the lack of all the other factors that you have to bring in like chemicals and</v>

4164
02:07:15.460 --> 02:07:19.150
<v Speaker 4>antibiotics and all these different things that are just unnecessary completely.</v>

4165
02:07:19.151 --> 02:07:21.550
<v Speaker 4>But the actual volume of food,</v>

4166
02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:22.420
<v Speaker 4>the actual,</v>

4167
02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:23.200
<v Speaker 3>all you have a food.</v>

4168
02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:23.771
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

4169
02:07:23.771 --> 02:07:28.330
<v Speaker 3>The actual volume of food is more in symbiotic places.</v>

4170
02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:28.681
<v Speaker 3>Let,</v>

4171
02:07:28.681 --> 02:07:29.020
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>

4172
02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:29.261
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4173
02:07:29.261 --> 02:07:29.950
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4174
02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:30.280
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4175
02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:35.110
<v Speaker 3>and are kind of farming with portable infrastructure allows you to use nooks and</v>

4176
02:07:35.111 --> 02:07:37.120
<v Speaker 3>crannies that currently aren't being used.</v>

4177
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Let me give you an example.</v>

4178
02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:40.750
<v Speaker 3>Let's take pigs as an example.</v>

4179
02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:43.240
<v Speaker 3>We run pigs in the,</v>

4180
02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:44.133
<v Speaker 3>in the woods,</v>

4181
02:07:44.350 --> 02:07:48.400
<v Speaker 3>and they eat acorns and bugs and weeds and things like that through the woods.</v>

4182
02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:52.450
<v Speaker 3>And they actually eat the bugs that would attack the trees in the woods of the</v>

4183
02:07:52.451 --> 02:07:53.320
<v Speaker 3>trees are healthier.</v>

4184
02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:59.760
<v Speaker 3>The fact is that we have millions and millions of acres of unused land.</v>

4185
02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:08.800
<v Speaker 3>There's not one reason for a single confinement hog facility in the entire</v>

4186
02:08:08.801 --> 02:08:09.634
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

4187
02:08:10.810 --> 02:08:15.810
<v Speaker 3>If we used our national forests are bureau land management,</v>

4188
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:17.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4189
02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:19.030
<v Speaker 3>pinyon pine in Colorado,</v>

4190
02:08:19.031 --> 02:08:20.950
<v Speaker 3>if we use mesquite in Texas,</v>

4191
02:08:21.310 --> 02:08:21.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4192
02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:22.773
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4193
02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:25.070
<v Speaker 3>appalachian hardwoods in,</v>

4194
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:30.430
<v Speaker 3>in the mid atlantic and south every place has millions of acres where these pigs</v>

4195
02:08:34.901 --> 02:08:37.990
<v Speaker 3>could be run and it does.</v>

4196
02:08:38.710 --> 02:08:41.710
<v Speaker 3>And you simply vacate the houses.</v>

4197
02:08:42.190 --> 02:08:42.970
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4198
02:08:42.970 --> 02:08:43.803
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4199
02:08:43.810 --> 02:08:44.720
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>

4200
02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:46.540
<v Speaker 3>the truth is we are,</v>

4201
02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:49.210
<v Speaker 3>we are not beginning to leverage.</v>

4202
02:08:49.690 --> 02:08:52.750
<v Speaker 3>We're not beginning to leverage the resource base that we have.</v>

4203
02:08:52.890 --> 02:08:56.160
<v Speaker 4>So when you're talking about is the resources that are untouched?</v>

4204
02:08:56.220 --> 02:08:56.581
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4205
02:08:56.581 --> 02:08:59.670
<v Speaker 4>So the factory farm system that we have,</v>

4206
02:09:00.090 --> 02:09:03.270
<v Speaker 4>the amount of food that they produce in order to produce that same amount of</v>

4207
02:09:03.271 --> 02:09:03.691
<v Speaker 4>fruit,</v>

4208
02:09:03.691 --> 02:09:05.340
<v Speaker 4>we would have to use more land.</v>

4209
02:09:05.490 --> 02:09:08.250
<v Speaker 4>We would have to use more areas that we're not using now.</v>

4210
02:09:08.370 --> 02:09:09.300
<v Speaker 4>We would have to.</v>

4211
02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:09.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4212
02:09:09.501 --> 02:09:10.850
<v Speaker 3>But it would be good land use.</v>

4213
02:09:10.970 --> 02:09:11.803
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

4214
02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:15.080
<v Speaker 3>it's not harmful land use,</v>

4215
02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:16.281
<v Speaker 4>I understand,</v>

4216
02:09:16.281 --> 02:09:21.281
<v Speaker 4>but that land is most likely either owned by the state national wildlife problem</v>

4217
02:09:22.190 --> 02:09:22.590
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

4218
02:09:22.590 --> 02:09:22.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4219
02:09:22.810 --> 02:09:23.121
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4220
02:09:23.121 --> 02:09:26.420
<v Speaker 4>And then the other problem would be where would the profit be?</v>

4221
02:09:26.421 --> 02:09:30.170
<v Speaker 4>Who would profit than if you're talking about national forests and you're</v>

4222
02:09:30.171 --> 02:09:32.840
<v Speaker 4>talking about a private company that grows agricultural,</v>

4223
02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:37.900
<v Speaker 4>gross farm animals in these natural forest who would be able to decide who gets</v>

4224
02:09:38.991 --> 02:09:40.220
<v Speaker 4>to use their animals.</v>

4225
02:09:40.221 --> 02:09:40.850
<v Speaker 4>And this.</v>

4226
02:09:40.850 --> 02:09:41.390
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4227
02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:41.661
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4228
02:09:41.661 --> 02:09:41.950
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

4229
02:09:41.950 --> 02:09:42.111
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4230
02:09:42.111 --> 02:09:46.520
<v Speaker 3>when governor tim kaine came to visit our farm toward the end of his governance,</v>

4231
02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:50.120
<v Speaker 3>the gubernatorial time in Virginia,</v>

4232
02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:51.473
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4233
02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:52.370
<v Speaker 3>he really got it.</v>

4234
02:09:52.371 --> 02:09:52.551
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4235
02:09:52.551 --> 02:09:53.210
<v Speaker 3>we went,</v>

4236
02:09:53.210 --> 02:09:53.720
<v Speaker 3>we went,</v>

4237
02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:54.411
<v Speaker 3>did all this,</v>

4238
02:09:54.411 --> 02:09:54.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4239
02:09:54.590 --> 02:09:56.190
<v Speaker 3>saw this and he,</v>

4240
02:09:56.191 --> 02:09:56.691
<v Speaker 3>he totally,</v>

4241
02:09:56.691 --> 02:09:57.680
<v Speaker 3>he totally bought into it.</v>

4242
02:09:57.681 --> 02:09:57.981
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

4243
02:09:57.981 --> 02:09:58.750
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

4244
02:09:58.750 --> 02:09:59.583
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4245
02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:00.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4246
02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:01.453
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

4247
02:10:01.790 --> 02:10:02.421
<v Speaker 3>what can I,</v>

4248
02:10:02.421 --> 02:10:03.051
<v Speaker 3>do you know,</v>

4249
02:10:03.051 --> 02:10:03.320
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

4250
02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:04.280
<v Speaker 3>what's the next step?</v>

4251
02:10:04.460 --> 02:10:04.731
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

4252
02:10:04.731 --> 02:10:04.941
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4253
02:10:04.941 --> 02:10:05.271
<v Speaker 3>governor,</v>

4254
02:10:05.271 --> 02:10:06.104
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

4255
02:10:06.230 --> 02:10:07.940
<v Speaker 3>let's have a meeting next week at the,</v>

4256
02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:08.360
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

4257
02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:13.360
<v Speaker 3>at the governor's mansion and iron out a lease arrangement where polyface can,</v>

4258
02:10:14.210 --> 02:10:18.110
<v Speaker 3>can run pigs in the state forests and keep all the trees from dying.</v>

4259
02:10:20.670 --> 02:10:21.031
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>

4260
02:10:21.031 --> 02:10:21.241
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4261
02:10:21.241 --> 02:10:23.430
<v Speaker 3>he smiled and he knew,</v>

4262
02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:28.520
<v Speaker 3>he knew sarah burley that I was exactly right because the appalachian hardwood</v>

4263
02:10:29.041 --> 02:10:34.041
<v Speaker 3>forests are dying and they're due to lack of disturbance,</v>

4264
02:10:34.730 --> 02:10:36.560
<v Speaker 3>lack of disturbance in our ecosystem.</v>

4265
02:10:36.561 --> 02:10:37.550
<v Speaker 3>We don't have the buFfalo,</v>

4266
02:10:37.551 --> 02:10:39.080
<v Speaker 3>we don't have the fires anymore,</v>

4267
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:43.550
<v Speaker 3>so they're dying due to lack of disturbance so we can absolutely bring those</v>

4268
02:10:43.551 --> 02:10:45.260
<v Speaker 3>forest back to vibrancy.</v>

4269
02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:48.920
<v Speaker 3>Right now they're just sterile,</v>

4270
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:49.903
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>

4271
02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:54.220
<v Speaker 3>they're just sitting there so they could be disturbed by these disturbance.</v>

4272
02:10:54.710 --> 02:10:55.340
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

4273
02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:56.870
<v Speaker 3>so his,</v>

4274
02:10:57.020 --> 02:10:59.570
<v Speaker 3>his understanding of ecology,</v>

4275
02:11:01.530 --> 02:11:02.580
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

4276
02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:07.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm mandated that he get his head around this idea.</v>

4277
02:11:08.130 --> 02:11:11.100
<v Speaker 3>But of course he grinned and laughed at and we both realized,</v>

4278
02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:11.521
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4279
02:11:11.521 --> 02:11:15.350
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine what the radical environmental groups would do if you said,</v>

4280
02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:20.360
<v Speaker 3>we're going to start leasing some of the state parks so people can grow pigs in</v>

4281
02:11:21.001 --> 02:11:21.834
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>

4282
02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:22.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4283
02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:23.033
<v Speaker 3>it would be.</v>

4284
02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:23.781
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4285
02:11:23.781 --> 02:11:25.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's unspeakable.</v>

4286
02:11:25.250 --> 02:11:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4287
02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:25.900
<v Speaker 3>let's</v>

4288
02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:29.950
<v Speaker 4>forget about their arguments against an environmental groups or peta or anybody</v>

4289
02:11:29.951 --> 02:11:31.300
<v Speaker 4>who might have an argument against it.</v>

4290
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:33.550
<v Speaker 4>If you have a clean slate,</v>

4291
02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:35.350
<v Speaker 4>and if it was your job,</v>

4292
02:11:35.530 --> 02:11:38.200
<v Speaker 4>you could design the,</v>

4293
02:11:38.201 --> 02:11:38.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4294
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:42.940
<v Speaker 4>the whole agricultural system of this country to feed America.</v>

4295
02:11:42.941 --> 02:11:43.480
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4296
02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:45.320
<v Speaker 4>Based on your principles,</v>

4297
02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:46.720
<v Speaker 4>easy.</v>

4298
02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:46.960
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4299
02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:47.740
<v Speaker 4>no question.</v>

4300
02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:52.740
<v Speaker 4>But we would have to use a lot of the land that's currently state land or</v>

4301
02:11:52.901 --> 02:11:54.010
<v Speaker 4>national forest.</v>

4302
02:11:54.630 --> 02:11:59.630
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that right now the us has 700 registered dead zones,</v>

4303
02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:01.081
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4304
02:12:01.081 --> 02:12:02.400
<v Speaker 3>Perry dead zones.</v>

4305
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:05.700
<v Speaker 3>One is the size of New Jersey in the gulf of Mexico.</v>

4306
02:12:06.150 --> 02:12:09.120
<v Speaker 3>Those dead zones are collateral.</v>

4307
02:12:09.230 --> 02:12:10.440
<v Speaker 3>They are now.</v>

4308
02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:13.320
<v Speaker 3>They are now inhospitable to life.</v>

4309
02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.471
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4310
02:12:13.471 --> 02:12:13.831
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

4311
02:12:13.831 --> 02:12:15.810
<v Speaker 3>that's the definition of a dead zone.</v>

4312
02:12:16.150 --> 02:12:16.650
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>

4313
02:12:16.650 --> 02:12:20.550
<v Speaker 3>they were once productive areas,</v>

4314
02:12:20.551 --> 02:12:20.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4315
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:23.040
<v Speaker 3>fisheries and amphibians,</v>

4316
02:12:23.041 --> 02:12:23.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4317
02:12:23.310 --> 02:12:27.420
<v Speaker 3>productive areas that are now inhospitable to life.</v>

4318
02:12:31.850 --> 02:12:36.850
<v Speaker 3>They are a direct result of overrunning our nests ability to handle our,</v>

4319
02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:45.013
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4320
02:12:45.770 --> 02:12:47.510
<v Speaker 3>our mechanistic creativity.</v>

4321
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:52.340
<v Speaker 3>And so the fact is that in North Carolina,</v>

4322
02:12:52.341 --> 02:12:54.350
<v Speaker 3>which leads the state in hog production,</v>

4323
02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:59.800
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't have a hurricane every two years to flush all the manure lagoons</v>

4324
02:13:00.020 --> 02:13:00.980
<v Speaker 3>out to the ocean,</v>

4325
02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:06.350
<v Speaker 3>North Carolina would now be buried in hog manure.</v>

4326
02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:07.850
<v Speaker 3>That's the truth.</v>

4327
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:09.700
<v Speaker 3>And so fortunately we,</v>

4328
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:10.700
<v Speaker 3>fortunately,</v>

4329
02:13:10.730 --> 02:13:11.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4330
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:13.130
<v Speaker 3>we get a hurricane every couple of years,</v>

4331
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:14.870
<v Speaker 3>tough flush North Carolina,</v>

4332
02:13:14.871 --> 02:13:15.830
<v Speaker 3>like a big toilet,</v>

4333
02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:16.843
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't,</v>

4334
02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:17.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4335
02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:18.620
<v Speaker 3>choke on its own waste.</v>

4336
02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:19.700
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4337
02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:20.330
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4338
02:13:20.330 --> 02:13:20.740
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

4339
02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:21.573
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4340
02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:23.590
<v Speaker 3>so The idea,</v>

4341
02:13:23.690 --> 02:13:25.460
<v Speaker 3>whose land are we using here?</v>

4342
02:13:25.970 --> 02:13:27.170
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk to the,</v>

4343
02:13:27.380 --> 02:13:32.280
<v Speaker 3>let's talk to the displaced a shrimp fishermen in the gulf of Mexico and talk</v>

4344
02:13:32.281 --> 02:13:33.270
<v Speaker 3>about displacement.</v>

4345
02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:34.770
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about land use.</v>

4346
02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Are you with me when we start talking about the whole,</v>

4347
02:13:38.540 --> 02:13:38.630
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4348
02:13:38.630 --> 02:13:39.450
<v Speaker 3>the whole,</v>

4349
02:13:39.450 --> 02:13:39.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4350
02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:40.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4351
02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:41.430
<v Speaker 3>land use issue.</v>

4352
02:13:42.210 --> 02:13:46.170
<v Speaker 3>Our system actually actually</v>

4353
02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:51.150
<v Speaker 3>would eliminate all of this dead zone,</v>

4354
02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:52.830
<v Speaker 3>all of this inhospitable,</v>

4355
02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:54.300
<v Speaker 3>the desertification,</v>

4356
02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:56.280
<v Speaker 3>all the collateral damage.</v>

4357
02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:01.640
<v Speaker 3>We would actually have far more productive land than we do today because we're,</v>

4358
02:14:02.681 --> 02:14:05.280
<v Speaker 3>we're toxifying a very small part.</v>

4359
02:14:06.270 --> 02:14:07.103
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4360
02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:08.340
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4361
02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:08.790
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4362
02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:09.623
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4363
02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:10.733
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

4364
02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:15.910
<v Speaker 3>you know that that toxic stream is killing a bunch of other land.</v>

4365
02:14:19.410 --> 02:14:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we just be honest and say,</v>

4366
02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:27.320
<v Speaker 3>let's use It all in a healing fashion and we will have any dead zones and it'll</v>

4367
02:14:27.841 --> 02:14:28.510
<v Speaker 3>all be,</v>

4368
02:14:28.510 --> 02:14:29.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4369
02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:29.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4370
02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:30.660
<v Speaker 3>progressively healing.</v>

4371
02:14:30.930 --> 02:14:32.760
<v Speaker 3>that sounds like a better alternative to me.</v>

4372
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:33.840
<v Speaker 3>So the only way to have</v>

4373
02:14:33.870 --> 02:14:35.250
<v Speaker 4>these healthy environments,</v>

4374
02:14:35.251 --> 02:14:36.810
<v Speaker 4>these healthy growIng environments,</v>

4375
02:14:36.811 --> 02:14:41.130
<v Speaker 4>is to have sort of a symbiotic relationship with all the various different types</v>

4376
02:14:41.131 --> 02:14:43.820
<v Speaker 4>of animals and the various different types of plants.</v>

4377
02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:48.980
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible to have acres and acres of things like corn and wheat without</v>

4378
02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:53.880
<v Speaker 4>animals roaming free and still have some sort of a healthy environment?</v>

4379
02:14:53.881 --> 02:14:54.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4380
02:14:54.150 --> 02:14:59.150
<v Speaker 4>can you grow a thousand acres of corn in a healthy way without having animals</v>

4381
02:15:01.681 --> 02:15:02.514
<v Speaker 4>and the environment?</v>

4382
02:15:04.090 --> 02:15:04.923
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4383
02:15:05.410 --> 02:15:07.330
<v Speaker 3>probably the short answer is no,</v>

4384
02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:09.700
<v Speaker 3>but if you.</v>

4385
02:15:09.730 --> 02:15:10.060
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

4386
02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:12.130
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean you can't grow grain.</v>

4387
02:15:12.190 --> 02:15:12.461
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4388
02:15:12.461 --> 02:15:13.300
<v Speaker 3>there are now,</v>

4389
02:15:13.630 --> 02:15:13.961
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4390
02:15:13.961 --> 02:15:14.890
<v Speaker 3>in Australia,</v>

4391
02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:15.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4392
02:15:15.580 --> 02:15:20.580
<v Speaker 3>they're really colin seis there who has visited a term called pasture cropping,</v>

4393
02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:21.641
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4394
02:15:21.641 --> 02:15:26.230
<v Speaker 3>has developed infrastructure and protocols for where you grow grain in perennial</v>

4395
02:15:26.231 --> 02:15:27.064
<v Speaker 3>pasture,</v>

4396
02:15:27.220 --> 02:15:27.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4397
02:15:27.580 --> 02:15:28.151
<v Speaker 3>without,</v>

4398
02:15:28.151 --> 02:15:29.350
<v Speaker 3>without much tillage.</v>

4399
02:15:29.710 --> 02:15:30.580
<v Speaker 3>So you don't,</v>

4400
02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:33.250
<v Speaker 3>you don't till the,</v>

4401
02:15:33.251 --> 02:15:33.561
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4402
02:15:33.561 --> 02:15:34.331
<v Speaker 3>the Blanket,</v>

4403
02:15:34.331 --> 02:15:37.720
<v Speaker 3>you don't till the vegetative blanket of the soil.</v>

4404
02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:41.200
<v Speaker 3>Instead you use livestock as a,</v>

4405
02:15:41.470 --> 02:15:46.470
<v Speaker 3>as a pruner to prepare a and even temporarily weaken the perennial grass plant</v>

4406
02:15:50.471 --> 02:15:51.430
<v Speaker 3>right into it.</v>

4407
02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:53.133
<v Speaker 3>The annuals,</v>

4408
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.831
<v Speaker 3>barley,</v>

4409
02:15:53.831 --> 02:15:54.131
<v Speaker 3>wheat,</v>

4410
02:15:54.131 --> 02:15:54.431
<v Speaker 3>rye,</v>

4411
02:15:54.431 --> 02:15:54.940
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

4412
02:15:54.940 --> 02:15:56.020
<v Speaker 3>and it grows.</v>

4413
02:15:56.021 --> 02:15:57.280
<v Speaker 3>Beats out the grass,</v>

4414
02:15:57.670 --> 02:15:58.690
<v Speaker 3>the grass days,</v>

4415
02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:03.720
<v Speaker 3>subordinated it in the shadow so that when the grain dries down,</v>

4416
02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:06.250
<v Speaker 3>you harvest the grain and you've already got a nice,</v>

4417
02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:07.570
<v Speaker 3>you Know,</v>

4418
02:16:07.570 --> 02:16:11.580
<v Speaker 3>a regrowth of a green material underneath with,</v>

4419
02:16:11.740 --> 02:16:14.590
<v Speaker 3>without ever actually destroying the sod.</v>

4420
02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:15.821
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

4421
02:16:15.821 --> 02:16:16.810
<v Speaker 3>that's been there now,</v>

4422
02:16:16.811 --> 02:16:19.000
<v Speaker 3>2000 farmers in Australia doing this.</v>

4423
02:16:19.001 --> 02:16:20.470
<v Speaker 3>It's jumping now to the us.</v>

4424
02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:26.040
<v Speaker 3>It's a real hot technology and it works.</v>

4425
02:16:27.070 --> 02:16:27.730
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4426
02:16:27.730 --> 02:16:28.563
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4427
02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:30.490
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of pieces to this.</v>

4428
02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:31.960
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

4429
02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:34.510
<v Speaker 3>if you quit feeding herbivores grain,</v>

4430
02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:38.440
<v Speaker 3>you tremendously reduce the amount of grain it has to be produced.</v>

4431
02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:40.420
<v Speaker 3>Then you go to a very good point.</v>

4432
02:16:40.510 --> 02:16:41.051
<v Speaker 3>That's a very,</v>

4433
02:16:41.051 --> 02:16:41.880
<v Speaker 3>very good point.</v>

4434
02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Then you go to a perennial and,</v>

4435
02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:44.820
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

4436
02:16:44.820 --> 02:16:45.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4437
02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:48.010
<v Speaker 3>at the top of the program we talked about these principles of nature,</v>

4438
02:16:48.011 --> 02:16:48.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4439
02:16:48.191 --> 02:16:49.450
<v Speaker 3>one is animals move,</v>

4440
02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:51.400
<v Speaker 3>another is that nature.</v>

4441
02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:53.530
<v Speaker 3>A natUre likes perennials.</v>

4442
02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Nature has very few annuals.</v>

4443
02:16:55.271 --> 02:16:56.104
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

4444
02:16:56.650 --> 02:16:58.100
<v Speaker 3>nature thrives on perennials.</v>

4445
02:16:58.101 --> 02:16:59.000
<v Speaker 3>So a,</v>

4446
02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:04.040
<v Speaker 3>a productive regenerative food system should be concentrated on perennials,</v>

4447
02:17:05.050 --> 02:17:05.883
<v Speaker 3>not annual.</v>

4448
02:17:05.890 --> 02:17:08.380
<v Speaker 3>So describe to people that don't know what the difference between those</v>

4449
02:17:08.650 --> 02:17:09.990
<v Speaker 3>perennial is a plant,</v>

4450
02:17:10.030 --> 02:17:11.530
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to plant every year.</v>

4451
02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:13.170
<v Speaker 3>An annual is a plan.</v>

4452
02:17:13.210 --> 02:17:14.410
<v Speaker 3>You have to plan annually.</v>

4453
02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:15.071
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4454
02:17:15.071 --> 02:17:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Every year.</v>

4455
02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:16.450
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4456
02:17:16.450 --> 02:17:17.650
<v Speaker 3>so grains,</v>

4457
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4458
02:17:18.610 --> 02:17:19.720
<v Speaker 3>squash plants,</v>

4459
02:17:20.630 --> 02:17:21.940
<v Speaker 3>your garden vegetables,</v>

4460
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:23.110
<v Speaker 3>those are annuals.</v>

4461
02:17:24.090 --> 02:17:25.720
<v Speaker 3>Blackberries are perennials,</v>

4462
02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:26.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4463
02:17:26.090 --> 02:17:29.470
<v Speaker 3>you plant them once you trees are perennials,</v>

4464
02:17:29.860 --> 02:17:30.491
<v Speaker 3>vines,</v>

4465
02:17:30.491 --> 02:17:31.324
<v Speaker 3>bushes,</v>

4466
02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:32.350
<v Speaker 3>grasses.</v>

4467
02:17:32.770 --> 02:17:33.603
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4468
02:17:33.670 --> 02:17:34.960
<v Speaker 3>those are all perennials.</v>

4469
02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:38.530
<v Speaker 3>And so that is the basis of the,</v>

4470
02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:40.510
<v Speaker 3>of nature's ecology is perennials.</v>

4471
02:17:40.511 --> 02:17:41.344
<v Speaker 3>Not annuals.</v>

4472
02:17:41.530 --> 02:17:46.530
<v Speaker 3>Realized that our ag policy in the United States is to subsidize,</v>

4473
02:17:47.410 --> 02:17:48.520
<v Speaker 3>not perennials,</v>

4474
02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:49.660
<v Speaker 3>but annuals.</v>

4475
02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:50.553
<v Speaker 3>Six of them,</v>

4476
02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:51.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4477
02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:52.060
<v Speaker 3>we corn,</v>

4478
02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:52.953
<v Speaker 3>soybeans,</v>

4479
02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:54.093
<v Speaker 3>cotton,</v>

4480
02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:56.140
<v Speaker 3>sugar and rice,</v>

4481
02:17:56.650 --> 02:17:58.030
<v Speaker 3>all of those are annuals.</v>

4482
02:17:58.210 --> 02:18:03.210
<v Speaker 3>So our official ag incentivization is to incentivize the very thing that</v>

4483
02:18:04.781 --> 02:18:05.620
<v Speaker 3>destroys soil.</v>

4484
02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:07.210
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

4485
02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:12.890
<v Speaker 4>And it's also hilarious that we insist on feeding animals grains just to get</v>

4486
02:18:12.891 --> 02:18:13.640
<v Speaker 4>them fatter.</v>

4487
02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:14.120
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4488
02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:14.781
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4489
02:18:14.781 --> 02:18:16.460
<v Speaker 4>that fat being an unhealthy fat.</v>

4490
02:18:16.461 --> 02:18:20.240
<v Speaker 4>I am amazed every time I go to a nice restaurant and they try to offer me that</v>

4491
02:18:20.241 --> 02:18:21.260
<v Speaker 4>coby beef stuff.</v>

4492
02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:21.850
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

4493
02:18:21.850 --> 02:18:22.071
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4494
02:18:22.071 --> 02:18:22.191
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4495
02:18:22.191 --> 02:18:25.670
<v Speaker 4>you'd get away from me with that sick cow thing is sick.</v>

4496
02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:25.931
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4497
02:18:25.931 --> 02:18:27.920
<v Speaker 4>it's so it's wonderfully marbled.</v>

4498
02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:28.491
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4499
02:18:28.491 --> 02:18:29.600
<v Speaker 4>that thing's dying.</v>

4500
02:18:29.930 --> 02:18:31.760
<v Speaker 4>Things barely alive when you shoot it.</v>

4501
02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:32.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4502
02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:32.760
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

4503
02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:34.680
<v Speaker 3>The liver livers probably swollen up.</v>

4504
02:18:34.980 --> 02:18:39.600
<v Speaker 3>So the point is that if we quit feeding herbivores grain,</v>

4505
02:18:39.601 --> 02:18:39.900
<v Speaker 3>we would,</v>

4506
02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:42.660
<v Speaker 3>we would grow way less than if we take the omnivores,</v>

4507
02:18:42.661 --> 02:18:46.860
<v Speaker 3>the pigs and the chickens and integrate them as salvagers.</v>

4508
02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:48.593
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

4509
02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:50.513
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

4510
02:18:50.550 --> 02:18:53.850
<v Speaker 3>if every kitchen had enough chickens to eat,</v>

4511
02:18:53.851 --> 02:18:55.020
<v Speaker 3>it's kitchen scraps.</v>

4512
02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:55.711
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4513
02:18:55.711 --> 02:18:55.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4514
02:18:55.861 --> 02:18:58.200
<v Speaker 3>like get rid of the pet dog and put it into two chickens.</v>

4515
02:18:58.201 --> 02:18:58.680
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4516
02:18:58.680 --> 02:18:59.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4517
02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:03.600
<v Speaker 3>If every kitchen had enough chickens to eat the kitchen scraps,</v>

4518
02:19:03.660 --> 02:19:07.530
<v Speaker 3>there would not be an egg industry in the us.</v>

4519
02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:09.093
<v Speaker 3>Not one.</v>

4520
02:19:10.020 --> 02:19:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4521
02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:12.240
<v Speaker 3>This was the role of chickens.</v>

4522
02:19:12.450 --> 02:19:14.430
<v Speaker 3>What we do instead is we,</v>

4523
02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:15.780
<v Speaker 3>we send our,</v>

4524
02:19:15.870 --> 02:19:19.470
<v Speaker 3>our kitchen waste down the disposal or out in the garbage.</v>

4525
02:19:19.471 --> 02:19:24.471
<v Speaker 3>It goes to the landfill and the whole ecosystem is deprived of the,</v>

4526
02:19:25.610 --> 02:19:30.610
<v Speaker 3>of the biomass that's to compost or digest and feed the next cycle of life.</v>

4527
02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:33.341
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>

4528
02:19:33.341 --> 02:19:35.480
<v Speaker 3>is really tough to keep two chickens in an apartment,</v>

4529
02:19:36.350 --> 02:19:36.720
<v Speaker 3>eh?</v>

4530
02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:38.310
<v Speaker 3>They don't take any more room than a quarter.</v>

4531
02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Then an aquarium or a durable to chickens?</v>

4532
02:19:41.121 --> 02:19:41.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4533
02:19:41.570 --> 02:19:43.520
<v Speaker 3>well they gotta rhonda wouldn't the whole idea.</v>

4534
02:19:43.521 --> 02:19:44.720
<v Speaker 3>They have to wander around.</v>

4535
02:19:45.850 --> 02:19:47.360
<v Speaker 3>They don't need a lot of growth room.</v>

4536
02:19:47.361 --> 02:19:47.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you,</v>

4537
02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:48.920
<v Speaker 3>if you had them,</v>

4538
02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:49.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4539
02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:50.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4540
02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.060
<v Speaker 3>three feet by two feet would be fine for two chickens.</v>

4541
02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:53.721
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

4542
02:19:53.721 --> 02:19:54.141
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4543
02:19:54.141 --> 02:19:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4544
02:19:54.890 --> 02:19:55.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4545
02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:57.320
<v Speaker 3>But what about foraging and all that good stuff.</v>

4546
02:19:58.700 --> 02:19:59.391
<v Speaker 3>Just just,</v>

4547
02:19:59.391 --> 02:20:00.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4548
02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:00.261
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

4549
02:20:00.261 --> 02:20:00.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4550
02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:00.981
<v Speaker 3>built,</v>

4551
02:20:00.981 --> 02:20:02.060
<v Speaker 3>build your box,</v>

4552
02:20:02.090 --> 02:20:04.370
<v Speaker 3>your container so that they can,</v>

4553
02:20:04.371 --> 02:20:05.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4554
02:20:05.170 --> 02:20:05.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4555
02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:10.590
<v Speaker 3>so that they can get to about 12 inches of compost underneath them and you just</v>

4556
02:20:10.731 --> 02:20:12.100
<v Speaker 3>throw your scraps in there and they.</v>

4557
02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:13.340
<v Speaker 3>And in the compost,</v>

4558
02:20:13.540 --> 02:20:14.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4559
02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:15.740
<v Speaker 3>feed your little pot garden.</v>

4560
02:20:16.330 --> 02:20:16.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4561
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:17.390
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4562
02:20:17.390 --> 02:20:17.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4563
02:20:17.601 --> 02:20:19.100
<v Speaker 3>whatever kind of pot garden you have,</v>

4564
02:20:19.101 --> 02:20:19.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4565
02:20:19.221 --> 02:20:20.140
<v Speaker 3>container gardens,</v>

4566
02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:21.110
<v Speaker 3>containers,</v>

4567
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.690
<v Speaker 3>containers yet.</v>

4568
02:20:21.690 --> 02:20:21.860
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

4569
02:20:21.860 --> 02:20:23.330
<v Speaker 3>but I'm happy with pop gardens too.</v>

4570
02:20:23.540 --> 02:20:26.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean take that whichever way you want to do it.</v>

4571
02:20:26.090 --> 02:20:26.690
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

4572
02:20:26.690 --> 02:20:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

4573
02:20:27.380 --> 02:20:28.370
<v Speaker 3>that becomes,</v>

4574
02:20:28.610 --> 02:20:29.730
<v Speaker 3>that becomes your,</v>

4575
02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:31.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4576
02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:31.511
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

4577
02:20:31.511 --> 02:20:33.860
<v Speaker 3>your fertilizer for your house.</v>

4578
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:38.060
<v Speaker 3>And what you do then is you turn your house instead of an ecological liability.</v>

4579
02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Your house becomes an integrated part of an ecosystem asset.</v>

4580
02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.141
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4581
02:20:44.141 --> 02:20:46.450
<v Speaker 4>it seems that in in that sense,</v>

4582
02:20:46.451 --> 02:20:50.380
<v Speaker 4>that giant cities like New York where people are stacked on top of each other,</v>

4583
02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:52.390
<v Speaker 4>they essentially a factory farming humans.</v>

4584
02:20:52.860 --> 02:20:53.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4585
02:20:53.460 --> 02:20:54.293
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

4586
02:20:54.390 --> 02:20:54.811
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

4587
02:20:54.811 --> 02:20:55.620
<v Speaker 3>They are a.</v>

4588
02:20:55.620 --> 02:20:56.160
<v Speaker 3>But there's.</v>

4589
02:20:56.160 --> 02:21:00.360
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of these cool ways now that we can.</v>

4590
02:21:00.410 --> 02:21:00.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4591
02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:01.620
<v Speaker 3>we can do it anyway.</v>

4592
02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:06.000
<v Speaker 3>If you take the pig and the chicken and you use them as their salvage operation,</v>

4593
02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:07.980
<v Speaker 3>then you cut even more grain,</v>

4594
02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:10.740
<v Speaker 3>so you take off the herbivore grain,</v>

4595
02:21:10.741 --> 02:21:14.670
<v Speaker 3>you take off the the chicken grain and the pig grain.</v>

4596
02:21:14.671 --> 02:21:15.504
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly</v>

4597
02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:20.780
<v Speaker 3>you don't have much grain use and when you don't need very much grain,</v>

4598
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:22.020
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to plow very much.</v>

4599
02:21:22.021 --> 02:21:23.280
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to plow very much.</v>

4600
02:21:23.730 --> 02:21:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Then you can go back to a perennially based system and you can go back to the</v>

4601
02:21:27.691 --> 02:21:32.691
<v Speaker 3>historic rotations were several years of perennials built the fertility for the</v>

4602
02:21:35.341 --> 02:21:37.950
<v Speaker 3>one or two years of annual extraction.</v>

4603
02:21:39.090 --> 02:21:39.923
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4604
02:21:40.290 --> 02:21:45.290
<v Speaker 3>now now you're on to a regenerating an actual healing soil building system.</v>

4605
02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:47.633
<v Speaker 3>So what you're</v>

4606
02:21:48.030 --> 02:21:53.030
<v Speaker 4>bing or describing in fact is the way that our culture should have been</v>

4607
02:21:53.041 --> 02:21:54.510
<v Speaker 4>engineered in the first place.</v>

4608
02:21:55.740 --> 02:22:00.740
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of what we have here is sort of the momentum of the past that we have</v>

4609
02:22:03.661 --> 02:22:07.830
<v Speaker 4>to deal with the momentum of this factory farm establishment that was set up</v>

4610
02:22:07.831 --> 02:22:11.400
<v Speaker 4>that's been providing us with food for decades upon decades upon decades.</v>

4611
02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:12.690
<v Speaker 4>Almost a century now.</v>

4612
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:13.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4613
02:22:13.460 --> 02:22:16.190
<v Speaker 3>And you have to understand in context,</v>

4614
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:19.720
<v Speaker 3>don't be too hard on the ancestors because it what,</v>

4615
02:22:19.790 --> 02:22:22.010
<v Speaker 3>what happened was it got easier.</v>

4616
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:24.920
<v Speaker 3>It got easier to grow</v>

4617
02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:27.833
<v Speaker 3>and feed it.</v>

4618
02:22:28.470 --> 02:22:29.220
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

4619
02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:34.220
<v Speaker 3>that came earlier than electric fence and scientific composting systems.</v>

4620
02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:41.600
<v Speaker 3>So it was the electric fence that allowed us to suddenly I'm,</v>

4621
02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:44.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm free,</v>

4622
02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:50.300
<v Speaker 3>free these animals from supposedly a efficient confinement programs and grain</v>

4623
02:22:52.561 --> 02:22:53.670
<v Speaker 3>feeding programs.</v>

4624
02:22:54.060 --> 02:22:54.891
<v Speaker 3>It was the,</v>

4625
02:22:54.891 --> 02:22:55.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4626
02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:56.730
<v Speaker 3>George Washington at mount vernon,</v>

4627
02:22:56.880 --> 02:22:58.650
<v Speaker 3>he always complained about the pigs.</v>

4628
02:22:58.651 --> 02:23:02.250
<v Speaker 3>He was a very meticulous record keeper and he always complained about the pigs</v>

4629
02:23:02.251 --> 02:23:04.350
<v Speaker 3>because he could never get them all in at once,</v>

4630
02:23:04.740 --> 02:23:05.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4631
02:23:05.191 --> 02:23:08.340
<v Speaker 3>because he just ran through the woods and they had their babies and you know,</v>

4632
02:23:08.341 --> 02:23:09.174
<v Speaker 3>you kinda.</v>

4633
02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:10.440
<v Speaker 3>Well it's hog killing time.</v>

4634
02:23:10.441 --> 02:23:10.931
<v Speaker 3>It's fall,</v>

4635
02:23:10.931 --> 02:23:11.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4636
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:12.240
<v Speaker 3>let's get what we can.</v>

4637
02:23:12.241 --> 02:23:12.541
<v Speaker 3>And a,</v>

4638
02:23:12.541 --> 02:23:14.220
<v Speaker 3>they'd get what they can never get them all.</v>

4639
02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:16.530
<v Speaker 3>So you never really knew,</v>

4640
02:23:17.310 --> 02:23:17.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4641
02:23:17.540 --> 02:23:17.730
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

4642
02:23:17.730 --> 02:23:19.230
<v Speaker 3>for a meticulous record keeper.</v>

4643
02:23:19.231 --> 02:23:20.041
<v Speaker 3>This was a nightmare,</v>

4644
02:23:20.041 --> 02:23:20.271
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4645
02:23:20.271 --> 02:23:20.401
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4646
02:23:20.401 --> 02:23:23.790
<v Speaker 3>you never could count all of his stock and um,</v>

4647
02:23:24.050 --> 02:23:24.270
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

4648
02:23:24.270 --> 02:23:25.680
<v Speaker 3>but that's the way pigs were used.</v>

4649
02:23:25.681 --> 02:23:26.610
<v Speaker 3>Pigs were just kind of,</v>

4650
02:23:26.611 --> 02:23:27.420
<v Speaker 3>they were just,</v>

4651
02:23:27.420 --> 02:23:28.380
<v Speaker 3>they were salvagers,</v>

4652
02:23:28.381 --> 02:23:30.240
<v Speaker 3>they were kind of nook and cranny,</v>

4653
02:23:30.241 --> 02:23:30.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4654
02:23:30.610 --> 02:23:31.980
<v Speaker 3>operating weren't fenced in.</v>

4655
02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:32.971
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4656
02:23:32.971 --> 02:23:35.460
<v Speaker 3>they weren't fenced in because there was no fence that would keep them in.</v>

4657
02:23:35.461 --> 02:23:39.450
<v Speaker 3>How in the world can you ever fence a pig in with a physical structure?</v>

4658
02:23:39.451 --> 02:23:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Even,</v>

4659
02:23:40.060 --> 02:23:40.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4660
02:23:40.260 --> 02:23:41.100
<v Speaker 3>this is before,</v>

4661
02:23:41.101 --> 02:23:42.780
<v Speaker 3>before a metal wire,</v>

4662
02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.381
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4663
02:23:43.381 --> 02:23:44.850
<v Speaker 3>the only fence they had were like,</v>

4664
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4665
02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:45.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4666
02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:46.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4667
02:23:46.050 --> 02:23:46.710
<v Speaker 3>rick's of,</v>

4668
02:23:46.710 --> 02:23:47.410
<v Speaker 3>of um,</v>

4669
02:23:47.410 --> 02:23:47.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4670
02:23:47.641 --> 02:23:49.410
<v Speaker 3>you've seen them around museums and stuff,</v>

4671
02:23:49.411 --> 02:23:49.910
<v Speaker 3>little,</v>

4672
02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:50.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4673
02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:53.040
<v Speaker 3>a chestnut rail fences will,</v>

4674
02:23:53.041 --> 02:23:54.690
<v Speaker 3>a pig would tear that apart in a hurry.</v>

4675
02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:56.040
<v Speaker 3>So what they did,</v>

4676
02:23:56.460 --> 02:23:56.880
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4677
02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:57.990
<v Speaker 3>they farmed,</v>

4678
02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:02.940
<v Speaker 3>they had an agriculture that was primarily exclusionary rather than</v>

4679
02:24:02.941 --> 02:24:03.840
<v Speaker 3>inclusionary.</v>

4680
02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:05.100
<v Speaker 3>So instead of,</v>

4681
02:24:05.130 --> 02:24:06.120
<v Speaker 3>instead of having,</v>

4682
02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:06.721
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4683
02:24:06.721 --> 02:24:09.510
<v Speaker 3>Thomas Jefferson wrote about this at marcelo in his farm book,</v>

4684
02:24:09.690 --> 02:24:14.690
<v Speaker 3>he had several slave boys that their job was to keep the livestock out of the</v>

4685
02:24:15.331 --> 02:24:16.164
<v Speaker 3>gardens.</v>

4686
02:24:17.350 --> 02:24:17.820
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4687
02:24:17.820 --> 02:24:20.400
<v Speaker 3>so the idea was that the livestock basically,</v>

4688
02:24:20.450 --> 02:24:20.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4689
02:24:20.910 --> 02:24:22.890
<v Speaker 3>ran free maybe,</v>

4690
02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:25.410
<v Speaker 3>maybe with a herder or something or you know,</v>

4691
02:24:25.411 --> 02:24:27.660
<v Speaker 3>there were some fields but not that many.</v>

4692
02:24:28.170 --> 02:24:30.990
<v Speaker 3>And then what you did is you protected your,</v>

4693
02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:31.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4694
02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:31.890
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

4695
02:24:31.890 --> 02:24:32.521
<v Speaker 3>your garden,</v>

4696
02:24:32.521 --> 02:24:34.350
<v Speaker 3>you protected your berries and you're,</v>

4697
02:24:34.351 --> 02:24:34.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4698
02:24:34.561 --> 02:24:36.660
<v Speaker 3>you're really high value stuff.</v>

4699
02:24:37.050 --> 02:24:39.690
<v Speaker 3>You protected that physically or with a fence,</v>

4700
02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:44.940
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a barricade because you simply couldn't afford to fence all the</v>

4701
02:24:44.941 --> 02:24:46.110
<v Speaker 3>animals and control them.</v>

4702
02:24:46.350 --> 02:24:46.860
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4703
02:24:46.860 --> 02:24:48.330
<v Speaker 3>so it became,</v>

4704
02:24:48.390 --> 02:24:51.960
<v Speaker 3>it became a lot easier to um,</v>

4705
02:24:52.770 --> 02:24:57.770
<v Speaker 3>to grow animals faster with grain than it did with controlled grazing because</v>

4706
02:25:01.861 --> 02:25:03.060
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't control the grazing.</v>

4707
02:25:03.690 --> 02:25:07.980
<v Speaker 3>So now the technology of electric fencing and,</v>

4708
02:25:08.730 --> 02:25:09.510
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

4709
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:14.510
<v Speaker 3>and composting has enabled us to bring the perennial pasture based model onto a</v>

4710
02:25:20.641 --> 02:25:23.160
<v Speaker 3>par with the grain model.</v>

4711
02:25:23.530 --> 02:25:28.530
<v Speaker 3>And the beauty of that is that the pasture based on non tillage model is an alt</v>

4712
02:25:29.471 --> 02:25:33.930
<v Speaker 3>is it's a soil building engine as opposed to tillage was s,</v>

4713
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:35.890
<v Speaker 3>which is a soil destroying engine.</v>

4714
02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:37.270
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

4715
02:25:37.270 --> 02:25:38.390
<v Speaker 3>so all of this,</v>

4716
02:25:38.391 --> 02:25:38.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4717
02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:41.230
<v Speaker 3>all of this has to be viewed in context and you have to,</v>

4718
02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:42.430
<v Speaker 3>you have to appreciate,</v>

4719
02:25:42.730 --> 02:25:43.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4720
02:25:43.210 --> 02:25:45.280
<v Speaker 3>I tell people you don't crucify grandpa,</v>

4721
02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:45.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4722
02:25:45.950 --> 02:25:46.410
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

4723
02:25:46.410 --> 02:25:46.660
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

4724
02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:47.170
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

4725
02:25:47.170 --> 02:25:48.820
<v Speaker 3>he was trying to do what he did,</v>

4726
02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:49.690
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

4727
02:25:49.690 --> 02:25:54.690
<v Speaker 3>but there's no excuse today for continuing grandpa's situation because we don't</v>

4728
02:25:54.761 --> 02:25:55.594
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

4729
02:25:55.870 --> 02:25:57.760
<v Speaker 3>we've got grant things that grandpa would have gIven.</v>

4730
02:25:57.761 --> 02:25:58.960
<v Speaker 3>Is it to have today?</v>

4731
02:25:59.070 --> 02:25:59.341
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4732
02:25:59.341 --> 02:26:00.600
<v Speaker 4>I think as we were saying before,</v>

4733
02:26:00.601 --> 02:26:04.650
<v Speaker 4>they were on the momentum of this past that was set up that couldn't also,</v>

4734
02:26:04.651 --> 02:26:07.920
<v Speaker 4>probably couldn't possIbly have anticipated the amount of population growth that</v>

4735
02:26:07.921 --> 02:26:08.754
<v Speaker 4>we have today.</v>

4736
02:26:08.910 --> 02:26:11.880
<v Speaker 4>That's very possible when you look at our future as a,</v>

4737
02:26:11.950 --> 02:26:13.950
<v Speaker 4>as a country and feeding us.</v>

4738
02:26:13.980 --> 02:26:15.150
<v Speaker 4>Do you have hope?</v>

4739
02:26:15.390 --> 02:26:15.781
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

4740
02:26:15.781 --> 02:26:17.730
<v Speaker 4>do you think that people are coming around?</v>

4741
02:26:18.300 --> 02:26:21.330
<v Speaker 4>People are certainly more aware where their food comes from now than ever</v>

4742
02:26:21.331 --> 02:26:22.110
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

4743
02:26:22.110 --> 02:26:23.850
<v Speaker 4>Do you see changes on the horizon?</v>

4744
02:26:24.430 --> 02:26:25.263
<v Speaker 3>I sure do,</v>

4745
02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:26.133
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

4746
02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:27.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

4747
02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:29.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm a pretty incorrigible optimist.</v>

4748
02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:29.511
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4749
02:26:29.511 --> 02:26:34.511
<v Speaker 3>overall I don't think though that the changes will be gentle.</v>

4750
02:26:37.450 --> 02:26:42.450
<v Speaker 3>You have to understand if what I've described in this program became normal,</v>

4751
02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:47.710
<v Speaker 3>it would completely invert the power position,</v>

4752
02:26:47.711 --> 02:26:52.540
<v Speaker 3>prestige and profit of the entire food and farming industry.</v>

4753
02:26:53.410 --> 02:26:57.100
<v Speaker 3>That's a big ship to turn around and they're not going to go gently into the</v>

4754
02:26:57.101 --> 02:26:57.934
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

4755
02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:01.750
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why we're seeing the backlash of the swat teams,</v>

4756
02:27:01.751 --> 02:27:01.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4757
02:27:01.940 --> 02:27:02.531
<v Speaker 3>coming in,</v>

4758
02:27:02.531 --> 02:27:03.880
<v Speaker 3>raiding people's freezers,</v>

4759
02:27:04.210 --> 02:27:05.410
<v Speaker 3>private food clubs,</v>

4760
02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:08.950
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing an increasing backlash.</v>

4761
02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:09.390
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

4762
02:27:09.390 --> 02:27:11.290
<v Speaker 3>the food safety modernization act,</v>

4763
02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:12.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4764
02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:12.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4765
02:27:12.521 --> 02:27:14.670
<v Speaker 3>proposed that a,</v>

4766
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:18.280
<v Speaker 3>you basically couldn't use compost to fertilize vegetables.</v>

4767
02:27:18.490 --> 02:27:18.720
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4768
02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:22.150
<v Speaker 3>we can't have animals and produce on the same farm.</v>

4769
02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:27.220
<v Speaker 3>We're going to outlaw of outdoor flocks of 3000 chickens are more,</v>

4770
02:27:27.450 --> 02:27:27.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4771
02:27:27.730 --> 02:27:28.171
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

4772
02:27:28.171 --> 02:27:28.481
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

4773
02:27:28.481 --> 02:27:31.480
<v Speaker 3>there's a huge pushback from,</v>

4774
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:33.550
<v Speaker 3>from that orthodoxy.</v>

4775
02:27:33.970 --> 02:27:34.810
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

4776
02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:37.390
<v Speaker 3>and I generally,</v>

4777
02:27:37.391 --> 02:27:37.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4778
02:27:37.661 --> 02:27:41.190
<v Speaker 3>if you studied collapser guns and germs or 14,</v>

4779
02:27:41.210 --> 02:27:42.640
<v Speaker 3>93 or whatever,</v>

4780
02:27:42.910 --> 02:27:43.301
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4781
02:27:43.301 --> 02:27:48.301
<v Speaker 3>what you find is that major societal change generally doesn't happen.</v>

4782
02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:49.240
<v Speaker 3>You knoW,</v>

4783
02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:51.160
<v Speaker 3>people don't just wake up and say,</v>

4784
02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:56.890
<v Speaker 3>I think I want a different society know it usually follows some major,</v>

4785
02:27:57.760 --> 02:27:59.590
<v Speaker 3>major thing and uh,</v>

4786
02:27:59.591 --> 02:28:04.591
<v Speaker 3>I mean the transition from draft power to automobile was incredibly disturbing,</v>

4787
02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:08.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4788
02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:09.520
<v Speaker 3>in America.</v>

4789
02:28:10.030 --> 02:28:10.720
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4790
02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:11.530
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4791
02:28:11.530 --> 02:28:15.070
<v Speaker 3>and I think that that if the industry.</v>

4792
02:28:15.170 --> 02:28:17.050
<v Speaker 3>Let me give you one more little story.</v>

4793
02:28:17.380 --> 02:28:18.370
<v Speaker 3>I spoke last week.</v>

4794
02:28:18.371 --> 02:28:21.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting ready to go to the Netherlands and do a week of seminars in the</v>

4795
02:28:21.771 --> 02:28:22.604
<v Speaker 3>Netherlands.</v>

4796
02:28:23.180 --> 02:28:24.013
<v Speaker 3>I spoke to their,</v>

4797
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:29.230
<v Speaker 3>one of their top ag journalist this week did an interview by phone and he said</v>

4798
02:28:31.671 --> 02:28:35.750
<v Speaker 3>that the previous week he had just interviewed the ceo of syngenta,</v>

4799
02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:38.960
<v Speaker 3>which is the european counterpart of monsanto.</v>

4800
02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:42.470
<v Speaker 3>And several years ago they adopted a plan,</v>

4801
02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:43.400
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

4802
02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:47.420
<v Speaker 3>a target that they Would increase productivity in grains,</v>

4803
02:28:47.450 --> 02:28:51.140
<v Speaker 3>the grains that they were working on by 20 percent,</v>

4804
02:28:51.141 --> 02:28:51.974
<v Speaker 3>by 20 slash 20,</v>

4805
02:28:52.700 --> 02:28:53.620
<v Speaker 3>20 percent by 2020.</v>

4806
02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:54.980
<v Speaker 3>Has a nice ring to it.</v>

4807
02:28:55.820 --> 02:28:56.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4808
02:28:56.120 --> 02:28:57.710
<v Speaker 3>there are several years into that plan.</v>

4809
02:28:57.980 --> 02:28:58.401
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

4810
02:28:58.401 --> 02:29:00.320
<v Speaker 3>for the last 15 years,</v>

4811
02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:03.050
<v Speaker 3>it's been totally flat.</v>

4812
02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Nothing we can do,</v>

4813
02:29:05.390 --> 02:29:06.710
<v Speaker 3>nothing we can invent.</v>

4814
02:29:06.711 --> 02:29:11.711
<v Speaker 3>Nothing we can do has been able to change grain production at all for the last</v>

4815
02:29:12.021 --> 02:29:12.920
<v Speaker 3>15 years.</v>

4816
02:29:14.660 --> 02:29:19.310
<v Speaker 3>What we're seeing is what joel Arthur Barker said when he wrote the book</v>

4817
02:29:19.311 --> 02:29:21.050
<v Speaker 3>paradigms 40 years ago,</v>

4818
02:29:21.051 --> 02:29:22.670
<v Speaker 3>introduced the word to the world.</v>

4819
02:29:22.970 --> 02:29:23.780
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

4820
02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:28.780
<v Speaker 3>one of the axioms of paradigms is that just when they appear to have achieved</v>

4821
02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:31.873
<v Speaker 3>perfection,</v>

4822
02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:37.360
<v Speaker 3>they're on the brink of collapse and the industrial food system has promised</v>

4823
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.921
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>

4824
02:29:39.921 --> 02:29:41.300
<v Speaker 3>free famine,</v>

4825
02:29:41.301 --> 02:29:42.134
<v Speaker 3>free,</v>

4826
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4827
02:29:43.850 --> 02:29:44.683
<v Speaker 3>a</v>

4828
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:47.120
<v Speaker 3>paradise,</v>

4829
02:29:49.100 --> 02:29:52.130
<v Speaker 3>and now with gmos and there,</v>

4830
02:29:52.150 --> 02:29:57.150
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of people that are really pumped up on their hubris who have</v>

4831
02:29:59.780 --> 02:30:04.780
<v Speaker 3>bought into this notion that we're going to go into some paradise nirvana only</v>

4832
02:30:05.871 --> 02:30:06.740
<v Speaker 3>to find out,</v>

4833
02:30:07.610 --> 02:30:08.420
<v Speaker 3>oops,</v>

4834
02:30:08.420 --> 02:30:13.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm gmos are causing spontaneous abortions and infertility.</v>

4835
02:30:14.300 --> 02:30:15.020
<v Speaker 3>Oops.</v>

4836
02:30:15.020 --> 02:30:15.651
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>

4837
02:30:15.651 --> 02:30:16.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4838
02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:18.050
<v Speaker 3>whereas evidence to don huber,</v>

4839
02:30:18.051 --> 02:30:18.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4840
02:30:18.580 --> 02:30:19.620
<v Speaker 3>have him on your show.</v>

4841
02:30:19.621 --> 02:30:20.031
<v Speaker 3>A don.</v>

4842
02:30:20.031 --> 02:30:24.350
<v Speaker 3>He reads a professor in ameritas from purdue university and he's showing the</v>

4843
02:30:24.351 --> 02:30:26.180
<v Speaker 3>direct relationship between,</v>

4844
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:27.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4845
02:30:27.060 --> 02:30:27.261
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

4846
02:30:27.261 --> 02:30:29.240
<v Speaker 3>or have Jeffrey Smith on a,</v>

4847
02:30:29.241 --> 02:30:32.000
<v Speaker 3>but the direct relationship between a glyphosate,</v>

4848
02:30:32.001 --> 02:30:32.870
<v Speaker 3>which is roundup,</v>

4849
02:30:33.260 --> 02:30:33.591
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

4850
02:30:33.591 --> 02:30:34.424
<v Speaker 3>which is the,</v>

4851
02:30:34.730 --> 02:30:39.230
<v Speaker 3>which is the herbicide that's now doubled in use since gmos came out.</v>

4852
02:30:39.260 --> 02:30:41.330
<v Speaker 3>That was the number one thing.</v>

4853
02:30:41.720 --> 02:30:42.553
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4854
02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:43.111
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4855
02:30:43.111 --> 02:30:44.480
<v Speaker 3>and there are absolutely,</v>

4856
02:30:44.710 --> 02:30:45.490
<v Speaker 3>absolutely,</v>

4857
02:30:45.490 --> 02:30:45.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4858
02:30:45.950 --> 02:30:47.420
<v Speaker 3>in the last year.</v>

4859
02:30:47.421 --> 02:30:47.950
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>

4860
02:30:47.950 --> 02:30:51.950
<v Speaker 3>we're in our 15th year with gmos.</v>

4861
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:58.000
<v Speaker 3>Remember it took 14 years to establish the ddt relationship with infertile frogs</v>

4862
02:30:59.931 --> 02:31:00.681
<v Speaker 3>in an exit,</v>

4863
02:31:00.681 --> 02:31:01.514
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't hatch.</v>

4864
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:02.840
<v Speaker 3>We're now 15 years.</v>

4865
02:31:03.050 --> 02:31:08.050
<v Speaker 3>Last year there were something like 74 studies around the world impugning not</v>

4866
02:31:09.471 --> 02:31:10.760
<v Speaker 3>only the claims,</v>

4867
02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:13.970
<v Speaker 3>but showing harmful side effects,</v>

4868
02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:16.490
<v Speaker 3>collateral damage of gmos.</v>

4869
02:31:17.880 --> 02:31:18.650
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4870
02:31:18.650 --> 02:31:23.650
<v Speaker 3>the idea that gmos are actually more productive is pretty much universally</v>

4871
02:31:23.671 --> 02:31:24.090
<v Speaker 3>debunk.</v>

4872
02:31:24.090 --> 02:31:24.630
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

4873
02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:27.570
<v Speaker 3>they simply have not shown a productivity increase.</v>

4874
02:31:28.620 --> 02:31:33.620
<v Speaker 3>And so what I'm getting at is that the industry has continued to peg a,</v>

4875
02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:38.910
<v Speaker 3>the future on this thing and present this,</v>

4876
02:31:38.911 --> 02:31:39.744
<v Speaker 3>this kind of,</v>

4877
02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:41.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4878
02:31:41.390 --> 02:31:41.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4879
02:31:41.940 --> 02:31:42.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4880
02:31:42.630 --> 02:31:45.630
<v Speaker 3>argument this face that all is well,</v>

4881
02:31:45.810 --> 02:31:46.171
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4882
02:31:46.171 --> 02:31:46.361
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

4883
02:31:46.361 --> 02:31:48.300
<v Speaker 3>we're getting ready to perfect everything.</v>

4884
02:31:48.301 --> 02:31:49.134
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be,</v>

4885
02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:50.233
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4886
02:31:50.240 --> 02:31:51.960
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be a new day in the morning,</v>

4887
02:31:52.020 --> 02:31:52.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4888
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:55.200
<v Speaker 3>And suddenly we see all these studies.</v>

4889
02:31:55.230 --> 02:31:56.430
<v Speaker 3>We see these direct science,</v>

4890
02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:57.600
<v Speaker 3>causal links,</v>

4891
02:31:57.601 --> 02:31:58.530
<v Speaker 3>collateral damage.</v>

4892
02:31:58.680 --> 02:31:59.460
<v Speaker 3>We see,</v>

4893
02:31:59.460 --> 02:31:59.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4894
02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:03.060
<v Speaker 3>one in four pigs right now in the industry,</v>

4895
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4896
02:32:03.510 --> 02:32:05.550
<v Speaker 3>is dying from a viral.</v>

4897
02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:07.950
<v Speaker 3>We see these things.</v>

4898
02:32:07.951 --> 02:32:08.640
<v Speaker 3>We see,</v>

4899
02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:09.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4900
02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:12.240
<v Speaker 3>a listeria campylobacter,</v>

4901
02:32:13.710 --> 02:32:14.580
<v Speaker 3>salmonella,</v>

4902
02:32:14.581 --> 02:32:15.450
<v Speaker 3>e cola,</v>

4903
02:32:16.080 --> 02:32:18.240
<v Speaker 3>all these new latin squiggly words,</v>

4904
02:32:18.241 --> 02:32:18.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4905
02:32:18.481 --> 02:32:18.901
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>

4906
02:32:18.901 --> 02:32:19.591
<v Speaker 3>pathogens,</v>

4907
02:32:19.591 --> 02:32:20.970
<v Speaker 3>autism on the increase.</v>

4908
02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:27.440
<v Speaker 3>My take is that we are just about ready for nature to say,</v>

4909
02:32:28.470 --> 02:32:28.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4910
02:32:28.741 --> 02:32:29.574
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4911
02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:30.420
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>

4912
02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:31.940
<v Speaker 3>you have taken enough shortcuts.</v>

4913
02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to bat and,</v>

4914
02:32:34.471 --> 02:32:34.800
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4915
02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:39.800
<v Speaker 3>and it follows barker's idea that all paradigms at the point of perfection or on</v>

4916
02:32:40.861 --> 02:32:44.580
<v Speaker 3>the brink of collapse when they're presented as perfect,</v>

4917
02:32:44.940 --> 02:32:46.500
<v Speaker 3>that's when they're on the brink of collapse.</v>

4918
02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:50.300
<v Speaker 3>I hope</v>

4919
02:32:50.300 --> 02:32:51.470
<v Speaker 4>people are listening to you.</v>

4920
02:32:51.650 --> 02:32:53.660
<v Speaker 4>I know people in the podcast listening to you,</v>

4921
02:32:53.661 --> 02:32:57.860
<v Speaker 4>but I hope people out there in the world of agriculture are really are listening</v>

4922
02:32:57.861 --> 02:32:58.041
<v Speaker 4>to you.</v>

4923
02:32:58.041 --> 02:32:58.401
<v Speaker 4>I know you,</v>

4924
02:32:58.401 --> 02:33:00.770
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of blowback a against you,</v>

4925
02:33:00.771 --> 02:33:01.840
<v Speaker 4>but I sure I,</v>

4926
02:33:01.950 --> 02:33:04.910
<v Speaker 4>I hope people are taking into consideration all these things that you're saying</v>

4927
02:33:04.911 --> 02:33:09.911
<v Speaker 4>is there's so much logic to your words and there's so much wisdom and so much</v>

4928
02:33:10.491 --> 02:33:12.880
<v Speaker 4>research done that it just,</v>

4929
02:33:12.890 --> 02:33:13.191
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4930
02:33:13.191 --> 02:33:14.024
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4931
02:33:14.390 --> 02:33:18.920
<v Speaker 4>it's a very puzzling situation for someone like me who knows very little about</v>

4932
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:22.310
<v Speaker 4>other than talking to you and reading and watching documentaries.</v>

4933
02:33:22.311 --> 02:33:23.030
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

4934
02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:24.890
<v Speaker 4>it's a very strange time.</v>

4935
02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:26.610
<v Speaker 3>It is indeed.</v>

4936
02:33:26.610 --> 02:33:29.190
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I encourage people to,</v>

4937
02:33:29.240 --> 02:33:29.950
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4938
02:33:29.950 --> 02:33:34.950
<v Speaker 3>to take their recreation entertainment budget of time and time and money and,</v>

4939
02:33:36.350 --> 02:33:39.110
<v Speaker 3>and start to participate in the food system.</v>

4940
02:33:39.111 --> 02:33:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Go visit a couple of farmers.</v>

4941
02:33:40.630 --> 02:33:41.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4942
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:46.030
<v Speaker 3>every single community is surrounded by really integrity farmers now they're</v>

4943
02:33:46.551 --> 02:33:47.151
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

4944
02:33:47.151 --> 02:33:47.930
<v Speaker 3>They're everywhere.</v>

4945
02:33:47.930 --> 02:33:49.960
<v Speaker 3>There is not a community in,</v>

4946
02:33:50.060 --> 02:33:55.060
<v Speaker 3>in the country that is devoid of really high quality integrity food.</v>

4947
02:33:57.020 --> 02:34:00.500
<v Speaker 3>Many of them are wanting to farm full time,</v>

4948
02:34:00.520 --> 02:34:00.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4949
02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:05.060
<v Speaker 3>and they need like 10 more customers or more customers to tip them over so they</v>

4950
02:34:05.061 --> 02:34:08.650
<v Speaker 3>don't have to commute to town with the town job to support their pharm</v>

4951
02:34:08.651 --> 02:34:09.484
<v Speaker 3>addiction.</v>

4952
02:34:11.210 --> 02:34:13.010
<v Speaker 3>I implore urban people,</v>

4953
02:34:13.940 --> 02:34:14.773
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4954
02:34:15.230 --> 02:34:16.520
<v Speaker 3>go To one less moVie,</v>

4955
02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:19.170
<v Speaker 3>go to leSs whatever,</v>

4956
02:34:19.171 --> 02:34:19.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4957
02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:19.960
<v Speaker 3>opera,</v>

4958
02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:20.650
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

4959
02:34:20.650 --> 02:34:21.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4960
02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:21.670
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

4961
02:34:21.670 --> 02:34:24.130
<v Speaker 3>but invest in this,</v>

4962
02:34:24.580 --> 02:34:27.700
<v Speaker 3>in this integrity food idea,</v>

4963
02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:32.560
<v Speaker 3>and you will hear farmers say the same things I'm saying they'll use</v>

4964
02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:36.670
<v Speaker 3>and you'll be able to see it with your eyes and you'll be able to,</v>

4965
02:34:36.910 --> 02:34:38.200
<v Speaker 3>you'll be able to taste,</v>

4966
02:34:38.201 --> 02:34:38.621
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

4967
02:34:38.621 --> 02:34:39.101
<v Speaker 3>touch.</v>

4968
02:34:39.101 --> 02:34:44.101
<v Speaker 3>You Will essentially connect with your ecological umbilical and that's a good</v>

4969
02:34:45.431 --> 02:34:46.264
<v Speaker 3>place to be.</v>

4970
02:34:46.380 --> 02:34:48.380
<v Speaker 4>I love the term integrity food too.</v>

4971
02:34:48.470 --> 02:34:50.310
<v Speaker 4>That's a really is a great term.</v>

4972
02:34:50.390 --> 02:34:51.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4973
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:52.050
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>

4974
02:34:52.051 --> 02:34:52.900
<v Speaker 4>You throw that around and,</v>

4975
02:34:52.901 --> 02:34:53.250
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

4976
02:34:53.250 --> 02:34:57.480
<v Speaker 4>I think what you're offering a as far as advice is fantastic.</v>

4977
02:34:57.481 --> 02:34:59.760
<v Speaker 4>Encourage people to go to these farmer's markets,</v>

4978
02:34:59.790 --> 02:35:04.770
<v Speaker 4>connect to these people that are growing food in this way and I think people are</v>

4979
02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:09.300
<v Speaker 4>most certainly more aware now than ever of where their food's coming from.</v>

4980
02:35:09.301 --> 02:35:10.260
<v Speaker 4>The term organic.</v>

4981
02:35:10.290 --> 02:35:13.920
<v Speaker 4>We never even heard that a couple of decades ago when it comes to food,</v>

4982
02:35:13.930 --> 02:35:14.970
<v Speaker 4>which just didn't exist.</v>

4983
02:35:15.010 --> 02:35:17.400
<v Speaker 4>Nobody talked about it and we've talked about gmos.</v>

4984
02:35:17.580 --> 02:35:18.780
<v Speaker 4>Nobody talked about anything.</v>

4985
02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:24.440
<v Speaker 4>All the 14 plus years that we have had gmos have been this massive series of</v>

4986
02:35:25.651 --> 02:35:28.020
<v Speaker 4>debates and denials and you know,</v>

4987
02:35:28.260 --> 02:35:31.170
<v Speaker 4>but I think people are more aware of it than ever before and I think a lot of is</v>

4988
02:35:31.171 --> 02:35:32.190
<v Speaker 4>because of people like you.</v>

4989
02:35:32.610 --> 02:35:34.860
<v Speaker 4>So thank you very much and thanks for coming on here.</v>

4990
02:35:34.861 --> 02:35:36.450
<v Speaker 4>It was a really interesting conversation.</v>

4991
02:35:36.451 --> 02:35:36.781

4992
02:35:36.781 --> 02:35:40.080
<v Speaker 4>really enjoyed it and I really appreciate all of your knowledge and the fact</v>

4997
