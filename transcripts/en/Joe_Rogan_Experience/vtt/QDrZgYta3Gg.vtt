1
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.443
Okay.

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.740
<v 1>Well,
good experience.</v>

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.940
Good googly Mowgli.
Bert Kreischer.
Hello everybody.

4
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.290
This is our fifth year anniversary.
Happy anniversary to us.
Uh,

5
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.500
Burt crushes here,
so yes,
will,

6
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.740
we will be imbibing and libations.

7
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.980
And as soon as Jamie gets us to fucking whiskey,
what are you doing,
Jamie?

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.330
We didn't make it.
Sure he knows what he's doing.
He basically Shit,
not really

9
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.810
bird Christ.
I'm fine.
How are you my friend?
So glad we're doing this today.

10
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:46.700
I haven't slept in like three days.
Excellent.
Tawang ballerup malaria pills.

11
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.250
Oh,
are you fucking with my head,
man?
Dude,

12
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:53.660
Dave Foley was on malaria pills and I had to keep him from attacking a reporter.

13
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.490
Oh,
that's what I fucking heard about it.

14
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.360
Cause I heard about malaria pills before I started taking them and I was like,

15
00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:02.720
these are bad news.
Right?
And then some people have adverse reactions.

16
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.870
If you drank alcohol while you've been on them,
well,

17
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:08.450
you're not supposed to do that.
I don't think.
Oh,
a well,

18
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.560
how much was going to sleep at the hallucinations?
I think,
um,

19
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.970
that was the issue with Dave.

20
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:17.660
I don't think you're supposed to drink when you're on that stuff.
Explain a lot.

21
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.470
Yeah.
I think it has,
uh,
some pretty negative impacts.

22
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.590
What's the name of the malaria medicine?
We'll Google it.
There's a little med,

23
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.450
I don't want to say it.
The delirium or Larry Medicine.

24
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.760
They uh,
it's fucking,
the dreams are insane.
I mean,

25
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:38.060
I'm already a really active dreamer,
but dreaming on malaria medication.

26
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.970
That's one of the first,
Google those malaria medicine and alcohol.

27
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.880
Malaria drugs and avoidance of alcohol.
Yeah.

28
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.590
It just shows you what a fucking friendly drunk I am.
Yeah.
Even on malaria pills,

29
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:56.060
I didn't get any trouble.
Yeah.
This is funny.
People are complaining.
They're like,

30
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.240
I was just reading that anyone taking drugs for protection against malaria

31
00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:03.140
should not drink alcohol.
What a vacation would it be if I can't drink?

32
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.150
So like the guy,
like I'm in the fucking Sudan.
How am I going to sleep at night?

33
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.460
What are the vacation that would be,
if I could drink,
this is exactly how I felt.

34
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:18.320
I can't have any,
your doctors told you this.
I don't think I will take it.

35
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500
We'd rather have a little fun and take the risk then be miserable.

36
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.190
This motherfucker is more interested in getting drunk.

37
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.900
Then he is catching malaria,

38
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:31.901
which has ready for it killed half the people that have ever died ever in the

39
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.580
history of the human race.

40
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.840
Are you having the people who have ever died ever have died from malaria?

41
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.740
That's where is that on that?

42
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.540
I heard it on the Internet.
No,
no.

43
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:51.950
I heard it from the radio lab,
from the radio lab podcast.

44
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.090
There was a woman on her who was talking about malaria and mosquitoes.

45
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.320
Great Radio Lab.
Does their work.
No,
they don't.
They,
they talked about quicksand

46
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.060
<v 2>porn and I cannot find one.
Really?
Yeah.
They talked about quicksand porn.</v>

47
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.450
The guys that are in it,
they called sinkers and I was like,
fuck,
I've never,

48
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.030
I've seen it all.
I thought and I was like,
I'm going to find quick porn.

49
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.410
I can't find it anywhere.

50
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.950
You're not looking hard enough so I've got your number that you're fucking in

51
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.140
quicksand.
I think.
I'm not certain how it works cause I can't find it.

52
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.220
<v 3>This is true.
Listen to this one.</v>

53
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.530
Out of every two people who have ever died of died of malaria,

54
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.180
this is from national geographic.

55
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.700
<v 2>Holy Shit.
What was the,
here's the question though.
What's the,</v>

56
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.720
what's the percentage of people that die?
They get malaria.
Listen to this.

57
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.380
<v 3>About 3.2 billion people.</v>

58
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.400
Almost half the world's population are at risk of malaria.

59
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.920
<v 2>Oh,
it's,
it's anywhere.
It's all over the fucking place.</v>

60
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.690
I'm getting back on the medication in two weeks.
This is insane.

61
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.490
<v 3>This is a,</v>

62
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.490
this is one of those really weird things that kills a shitload of people and

63
00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:04.100
we're kind of immune to it.
We don't get it much over here.

64
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.690
So we,
we don't give a fuck about malaria.
Like no one's,

65
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.960
everyone is so terrified about Ebola because it came over here.
Oh my God.

66
00:04:11.961 --> 00:04:16.940
They brought their dirty disease to America.
My God.

67
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.260
But nobody talks about fucking malaria.
Malaria is terrifying.

68
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.440
Bert.
Quick same port.
Shut up.

69
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.613
He found it.

70
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.040
<v 2>Will you pass me that link?
Wow.
This is crazy,
man.
Yeah,
you want to,</v>

71
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:38.850
you want it another scary ones.
Rabies.
Once you get rabies,
you're dead.

72
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.930
<v 3>Listen to these numbers.
Ready for this shit.</v>

73
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.350
2013 there were 198 million malaria cases with an uncertainty range of 124

74
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.730
million to 283 months.

75
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.590
So that means that when they say one 98 and maybe as low as 1:24 AM I be as high

76
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.830
as 283 so like this is the kind of infrastructure you're dealing with.

77
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.800
I mean,
you're dealing like insanely impoverished areas,
right?
Okay.

78
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:10.801
It says an estimated 584,000 malaria deaths with an uncertainty range of between

79
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.870
three 67 and seven 55 so it might be as low as 300 because they're uncertain

80
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:24.040
about the numbers of whether 500 million or 584 million is accurate.

81
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.680
So it could be as low as 367 million,

82
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.520
367,000 rather or as high as 755,000 so as many as 755 they'll just,

83
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.100
let's go with the lowest number.

84
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.370
366 or 367,000 that's the low number of their uncertainty range.

85
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.130
The mansion that many people dying of a fucking disease in a year.

86
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.090
367,000 that's amazing.

87
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.390
<v 2>That's like a 13 football stadiums,
Sunday packed game only you</v>

88
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.080
<v 3>would think that way.
How many is,</v>

89
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.400
is it 100,000

90
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.650
<v 1>that gets into those ball games?
So the big ones,</v>

91
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.510
like Florida state was I think like thirty five thousand eighty five thousand a

92
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.100
football stadium full of people.
I think they get bigger.

93
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:10.940
Like what's the youngest one?
What's the like Dallas stadium 60 or something,

94
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:14.870
right.
I want to say death valley is really fucking big.
I know Ohio state's like,

95
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.590
I want to say,

96
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.780
I have to say it's like a hundred thousand there's gotta be some that are like

97
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:22.170
100,000 right?
Well,
how much?
Hundred Five Ohio state.

98
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.960
I am fucking so proud when it should be.
You should be honored.

99
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.690
But that's a,
that's a big fucking number of people.

100
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:33.830
300 plus thousand people dead of a disease and no one even talks about it cause

101
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:36.920
we don't get it here.
Yeah,
it was in Calabasas.

102
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.560
He imagined in fucking malaria made its way to bel air.

103
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.560
How much people would be freaking out.
White people would be losing their shit.

104
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.800
Everyone would be on a medication.
What's amazing is you're right Pete,

105
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:49.370
the callousness,
I mean we'd go to the farm state where we're talking about,

106
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.790
and I had people on my crew just hop off of the malaria medicine.
They're like,

107
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.290
I can't deal with it.
And I was like,
my director at Paul was like,
you know,

108
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.080
cause if you skip a day,
you're fucked.
You got to take it every day,

109
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.930
two days before you're in the area while you're in the area.

110
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.100
And then seven days after the area,
dude,
fuck all that.
Fuck all that.

111
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.060
I'm invaluable.
It's still taking malaria pills.
God dammit malaria.

112
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.690
It sounds like something you'd order with breakfast,
malaria.

113
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.690
Would it be a drink or it'd be like a jam.
It's something from the south.
Oh,

114
00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:26.270
I'll get some malaria on the side.
Can I get some malaria with my grits?
Did does,

115
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:27.104
you're right.

116
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.760
Malaria fucked up disease man.

117
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.800
That is a crazy statistic that one out of two people that have ever died ever

118
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:40.400
died of malaria.
And you want another real shit.
One is den,
gay fever.

119
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.940
How can it be shittier than that?
Because you get half covered.

120
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:46.940
They got half the deaths covered.
How's it going to be worse?
No,
no,
no.

121
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:49.790
I think the disease,
getting the disease,
you get it.
You're just like,

122
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.800
you're like sick as fuck for like three weeks.

123
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.870
Then it goes away for a month and it comes back 10 times worse.
And so,

124
00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:00.500
you know,
that shit's around the corner.
You feel better and you're like,
fuck,

125
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:05.450
it's just going to give bad why it's so it gets good and then it gets bad ever

126
00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:10.300
with everyone.
But uh,
yeah.
Well I don't know why I shouldn't say things but,

127
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.700
but yeah,
by my cameraman.
Got It.
And he and he got an Africa and then,
and I got,

128
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.590
I got the dengue fever shot,
I got Japanese encephalitis,
Hep Bay,
have bee,

129
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:26.510
I got all of them.
We had a,
we had a guy,

130
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.250
um,
that um,
does our podcast,

131
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.920
Justin wren and uh,
he was supposed to be here.
He,

132
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:38.921
he does a lot of work in Africa and he was in Africa doing this stuff with

133
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.350
pygmies.
He sets up a wells for the matches.

134
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.300
He used to fight in the UFC,
went to,
went to the Congo,

135
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:51.320
fell in love with these pygmies.

136
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:53.330
Just they're like the nicest people that you like,

137
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:54.710
feels dedicated to helping them.

138
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.290
So he has like this foundation called fight for the forgotten,

139
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.560
puts all this money towards building wells and we even donate some money and we,

140
00:09:03.561 --> 00:09:05.340
we had a bitcoin people,

141
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:09.750
they donated money to my bitcoin and I matched whatever they donated and we sent

142
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:12.690
him some money to help them with wells and shit.
Anyway,
point being,

143
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.350
he's supposed to be on last week,
but he was sick and I was like,
no,

144
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:19.260
you could stay home for a little bit too much.
And he's like,
well,

145
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:22.470
I've been home for two weeks,
so whatever,
it's can't be bowl.
I'm like,
I just,

146
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:24.670
the fact that you had it tell me that too.

147
00:09:24.671 --> 00:09:27.880
So you stay the fuck home for a little bit fella.
It was,

148
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.461
<v 2>I'll tell you what,</v>

149
00:09:28.461 --> 00:09:32.270
last night we were at the hospital with Eila until like six in the morning.

150
00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:36.770
I was telling these guys and they tested her for the flu and she felt like she

151
00:09:36.771 --> 00:09:41.390
got the flu the second they came back with that,
they shut the doors,

152
00:09:41.391 --> 00:09:45.950
they put signs on the door and anyone that entered her exit wore a mask.
Wow.

153
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.730
And I was like,
man,
the dehumanization of that moment.

154
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.290
And then when she went to leave,

155
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:53.240
they put a mask on her and she looked at me and she was like,

156
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.300
it was going like really out of it.
But like why are they doing this to me?

157
00:09:56.301 --> 00:10:00.380
Almost like have I been affected?
Am I,
am I getting separated from the pack?

158
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.930
And that feeling and I looked at her,
I was like,
it's Paparazzi baby.

159
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.680
Cause she would laughed.
And then my wife took her and I stayed and got an Uber.

160
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.300
<v 1>Well,
you know the done.
That's cool man.
The,
um,</v>

161
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.600
the number of people that die from the flu is pretty staggering.
Fuck.

162
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.300
If you ever look at that,
the number of people that die from the flu,
I was,

163
00:10:16.301 --> 00:10:18.160
I was really shocked.
I was like,
wow,
you know,

164
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.070
we don't think about it because it's something that everybody gets,
you know,

165
00:10:21.071 --> 00:10:23.320
it's like once every couple of years are gonna have the flu.

166
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.820
I get the flu like every other year.
It seems like,
I don't think I get it.
No,
no.

167
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.720
Cause I get a flu shot.
Yeah,
I do.
I do get flu shots,
but,
um,

168
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:36.190
I also get like,
I don't,
I don't know really what the flu is technically.
Like,

169
00:10:36.191 --> 00:10:39.160
is it a chest cold?
Is it throwing up sweating?

170
00:10:39.161 --> 00:10:43.330
Like just buckets of sweat and you're just fevers,
chills,
fevers,
chills.

171
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.940
I've the plug on the flute.
I've never gotten the flu once.

172
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.220
Take a guess as to how many people you think die.
All right,

173
00:10:48.221 --> 00:10:52.120
we're talking about 370 million.
I think it's 3:00 PM three.
Oh,

174
00:10:52.121 --> 00:10:55.570
seven 50,000 for 350 million.
Oh yeah.

175
00:10:55.571 --> 00:11:00.250
Three w the low number area for malaria is three 37 three 37 I wanna say one

176
00:11:00.251 --> 00:11:05.170
2,525 America.
Oh Shit.
Uh,

177
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.500
25th fifty thousand fifty thousand what do you think Brian?

178
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:15.210
Hundred and 50,036 36,000 oh six 36 pussies.

179
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.740
Lot of it's like 31 more than have died from Ebola.
I mean,

180
00:11:20.741 --> 00:11:23.140
how many fucking people would die from Ebola?
From America,

181
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.680
but a few people got it over there,
came back.
But I,

182
00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:31.160
I'm pretty sure they've all been treated right.
I think one died.
One died.
Yeah.

183
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:36.190
I think,
no,
let's find out that how many people died.

184
00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:39.160
I don't think anybody died.
How many people died from Ebola in America,

185
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.100
<v 2>by the way,
if this was a statistical in skydiving,</v>

186
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.870
I could jump right in with the actual odds.
I've,

187
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.430
I'd Google that every time before I go skydiving.
The skydiving thing is scary.

188
00:11:49.431 --> 00:11:52.490
I think it's 43 this year.
It was 48 two years ago.
Oh,

189
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.010
<v 1>dad's friend</v>

190
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.070
<v 2>died.
So that alone is just too close.
You know,</v>

191
00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:00.340
like I know somebody who's know somebody that died so nope.

192
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:07.030
Yeah.
How did he die?
Malaria.
Malaria.

193
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:07.780
Skydiving.

194
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:12.780
It was a woman and it gets her her right or her chutes got tangled up.

195
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.580
<v 3>There was one death in the USA last year.</v>

196
00:12:16.581 --> 00:12:21.581
Four people got it and one person died from the flu from Ebola.

197
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.710
Oh.
So,
um,

198
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:29.780
I'm assuming that means that they were there when they got it,

199
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.580
but that might not be the case.

200
00:12:31.581 --> 00:12:35.270
They might have been dealing with somebody who had it when they came back.

201
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.760
<v 2>I'm assuming they had to be there,
come home with it.
And I think our,</v>

202
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.730
I think it was the first patient and he was patient zero cause the next one was

203
00:12:41.731 --> 00:12:45.650
a doctor in Atlanta,
if I'm not mistaken.
And I only say that because,
uh,

204
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:50.290
I remember hearing the news say something about if you can track it early,

205
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:52.270
like the,
all the nurses,
they caught it in Texas.

206
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.390
They got it and they were on top of it.
They were like,
Oh shit,

207
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.310
I'm not feeling good.
I got Ebola.

208
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.010
<v 3>Right.
They,
they jumped on it and got treat.
What did,
what is the treatment,</v>

209
00:13:01.011 --> 00:13:05.000
you know,
I mean,
well they just,
they must give you a lot of liquids and keep Ya.

210
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.470
<v 2>I'd imagine it's keeping the keeping.
I'm sure.</v>

211
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:11.790
What is the killer is the fever because you know,
that was the,

212
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.930
that's the big fear is if Phoebe gets over one or four,

213
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:17.080
we're talking brain damage and,
and start cooking.
Yeah.

214
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.470
And so I'd imagine that's what it is.
And you can't lower the fever,

215
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:25.300
<v 3>which is amazing that people can live in Phoenix,
you know,
or Vegas.</v>

216
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.170
Really fucking fascinating.
Yeah.
Vegas is fucking insane.
In the summer,

217
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.570
like you're walking around in the summer,
it's 120 degrees out.

218
00:13:31.571 --> 00:13:36.380
Like what the fuck is,
what does 108 who stopped here?
Why did you guys stop her?

219
00:13:36.381 --> 00:13:38.650
You stopped here.
You get a pump,
all your water from Colorado.

220
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:41.620
You get this crazy fucking system where you have a,
this,

221
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.470
this Goddamn goddammit monolith in the,

222
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:48.190
in the middle of the desert that has neon that's lit 24 hours a day.

223
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:49.750
You have extreme energy demands.

224
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.020
You've mother fuckers built like this is a crazy spot to build.

225
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.950
You know the the only reason why it was built there at all,

226
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:03.250
because it was built by mobsters gambling,
right?
Yeah.
But the,
the idea was like,

227
00:14:03.251 --> 00:14:07.060
hey,
we'll just make mean,
think about how crazy they were when they made Vegas.

228
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:12.040
We're going to make a wild fucking place with very few laws.

229
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.490
Just make it so it's four hours drive to get out there from La.

230
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.510
Like you're not really going to drive like,
especially back those days,

231
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.430
those old rickety ass cars.

232
00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:25.000
Can you imagine what a fucking commitment it was to go to Vegas in 1950 and

233
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:26.380
[inaudible] 55 bel air

234
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.340
<v 2>on the roads,
the roads back then dog shit.
How shitty the fucking right.</v>

235
00:14:30.341 --> 00:14:33.380
I guarantee you.
Part of that was w was still dirt

236
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:38.140
<v 3>dog shit.
Roads,
dog shit cars,
no radio.
No.</v>

237
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.650
If they had a radio,
air conditioning is suspect.
What,

238
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.500
what radio stations make it all the way the fuck out the middle of the desert

239
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:47.060
and they probably had weak ass signals back then and they probably only want

240
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:52.070
worked for a few miles when phone.
Yeah,
if you got lucky,
you went up to

241
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.150
<v 1>a place that had a dial phone,
you know?
Oh you,</v>

242
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.120
oh you better pack your fucking water because there's at least a two hour

243
00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:01.490
stretch that there is no one.
Not only that,

244
00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:04.700
you're most likely you're going to need extra water for your fucking car anyway

245
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:07.700
because that bitch is going to overheat because the radiators sucked in those

246
00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:11.810
old pieces of shit.
But he knew how to fix one though.

247
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.950
That was the difference.

248
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.730
Like if you pulled into a gas station back then and you know you had a 1955

249
00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:20.420
Chevy,
they would go,
oh look here.
Your uh,
your spark plugs bad,

250
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:23.820
the alternator's not working.
You've got,
this is a,
I could see right here,
your,

251
00:15:23.821 --> 00:15:28.490
your brake fluids low.
Now you open up like a 2015 Cadillac,

252
00:15:28.491 --> 00:15:30.290
you open up the hood.
You're like,
what am I looking at?

253
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.130
I have no idea what any of this says.
This is all just a big computer grid.

254
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.040
What's that black box in the corner?
Fuck is all this.

255
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.890
What's the thing that says Nsa that's on the hood?

256
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.860
What is this black thing is this is following me.

257
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.190
I tried to change my daughter's back tire than one attached to the chain

258
00:15:46.191 --> 00:15:49.550
yesterday and I was like sitting there going,
how the fuck did I do this?

259
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.680
I was like,
I know that this should be something that's in my skillset.
Right,

260
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:57.530
but it's just not here anymore.
I remember how to put one back on.

261
00:15:57.531 --> 00:16:00.440
Remember when you chain would pop off and you used to have to get your fingers

262
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:04.160
up in there and figuring out how to put that fucker back.
Kids today,

263
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:05.240
they don't have to worry about this shit.

264
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.640
Carl Brown wrote the tip of his finger off that way.
Who?

265
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.750
Corey Brown kid in your neighborhood near the,
I play baseball with,
oh,

266
00:16:10.751 --> 00:16:12.710
well one of the only black dudes that our school,

267
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.400
but at the tip of his finger was gone.
Oh Wow.

268
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.790
And he does it from putting a chain back on and he did that thing and food

269
00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:21.410
finger got caught sliced on you.

270
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:26.210
When you're around a bunch of hard men like lumber Jack type characters,

271
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.160
you're always going to find missing fingers.

272
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.520
There's always a dude who's missing a digit or a piece or something.

273
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:38.140
Something got chopped off in a wood saw or something got stuck under a rock and

274
00:16:38.141 --> 00:16:39.530
they end up fucking break it off.

275
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.290
Do you know how sad that would make me if I lost my finger?
Cause like I,

276
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.520
you just think that's,
that's me forever now.

277
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.820
I no longer have that little piece of way better than losing a lot of shit.

278
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.910
I'll take a finger all day.
I lost,
I lost all my teeth,

279
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.370
all of them except for eight that are in my mouth off here.

280
00:16:58.371 --> 00:17:01.180
I'll show you my eighth.
They're still my mouth and you'll be like,
what happened?

281
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.930
Fuck.
Why bad teeth to begin with?
Like I,
you know,
math hereditary.
My mom,

282
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.460
mom's on Methadone.
I was on math and smoking and dry.
No,
but,
uh,

283
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:11.990
I had bad teeth to begin with.

284
00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:14.510
And then on my 11th birthday I got hit in the mouth with a baseball bat.
Oh,

285
00:17:14.511 --> 00:17:17.030
Jesus.
Whipped back teeth and it not.

286
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.510
It broke all the ones in the front and chipped all the ones in the back.

287
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:23.870
Will you just in the wrong place at the wrong time and the kid was swinging or

288
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:28.010
no.
W I was catcher,
a pass ball.
I stopped it.
Throw my mask off,

289
00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:32.090
throw the guy out at third and the guy,
the batter trying to break the play up,

290
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.530
thought he'd hit me with the bat.

291
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.920
We're fucking 11 I don't know where the competition in this kid's house was,

292
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:41.680
but oh my God.
For you in the head with a bat to stop the fuck and play,
I guess.

293
00:17:41.681 --> 00:17:42.800
I know a little psycho.

294
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:47.120
It was my birthday too and annual and there's something fucking crazy.

295
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.670
My Dad kept me in the game until the was over.

296
00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.830
God moved me over to shortstop because we were short players and he couldn't

297
00:17:53.831 --> 00:17:56.010
stop someone out in the fourth inning.
He was your dad,

298
00:17:56.011 --> 00:18:00.360
the coach that was the fucking coach.
And I was like,
and I went into the blocker,

299
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:04.500
into the,
dug out.
My Dad's like,
buddy,
I need Jack shortstop.
And I was like,

300
00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:07.440
and that's not my dad.
I mean,
I guess it is my dad,
but it's not my,

301
00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:12.180
I never met teeth missing 20.
I don't 26 or something fell out.

302
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.690
26 teeth fell out right there.
No,
26 were damaged.

303
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.960
And so there are just fell out right there after he got hit in the face with a

304
00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:21.990
bat.
Like you knew you were fucked up.
Uh,
well,

305
00:18:21.991 --> 00:18:26.670
definitely all the ones up front and all the ones gone.
They were on home plate.

306
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:31.800
And your dad made you still fucking,
yeah,
I saw my dad.
He's like,
well,

307
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.060
I mean we're going to lose game,
you know?
Wow.
Yeah.

308
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:39.550
That's a good way to fuck up a kid.
Turned them into a comedian.
Yeah.

309
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.260
Well that's how you fuck up a person.
You can't be normal and become a comedian.

310
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:44.331
But uh,

311
00:18:44.331 --> 00:18:49.110
and so all my teeth are veneers are bonded or crowns or posts and crowns.

312
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.180
Wow.
Yeah.
That's harsh dude.
That's why I look at guys,

313
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.610
the guys in the UFC who fight and and no one ever loses teeth.

314
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.880
I'm always shocked at that.
So my teeth are super vulnerable.
Like if you,

315
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.950
if I got hit in the mouth with a piece of plastic fruit in high school and it

316
00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:09.750
shattered a tooth.
Wow.
My friends are fake.
Awesome.

317
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.900
Really was in a car accident as a kid really getting hit in the mouth with a bat

318
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:19.140
and then your dad throws you into the fucking game.
Just keeps me in the game.

319
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.180
Throws you back at the game.
Sorry,

320
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.610
what was that kid that hit you in the face of the bat?

321
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.350
Did you stay friends with him?
I didn't know that dude.

322
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.250
I never heard from another team.
It was the other team.
Wow.
Did he say sorry?

323
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.880
No I didn't.
Why don't I maybe,
I'm sure his mom made him say something,

324
00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:36.750
but I wasn't in a place to hear it.
Wow.
Oh my birthday.

325
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:39.720
And we had to go to the dentist like for the emergency,

326
00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:43.020
like did you ever see that kid again after that?
I have no idea who he was.

327
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.200
I don't even know the kid.
Wow.
That's probably better.

328
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:49.740
That way you don't have like this one person in your mind that you have to seek

329
00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:53.420
out and destroy and you're,
you know,
you Facebooking.
I'm seeing that he's happy.

330
00:19:53.421 --> 00:19:54.151
You're like,
fuck,

331
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:57.660
I have fake teeth and you just want to get back at him for some shit that

332
00:19:57.661 --> 00:20:00.390
happened when you were 11 people.
I like that man.

333
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:04.410
People fucking fester on things where it'd be way better if you didn't know.

334
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.090
You know in that case you're not going to go back and fuck this 11 year old up

335
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.510
who's now 43 I don't even have attachment to the,

336
00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:14.820
I don't have attachment to the incident.
In a weird way.

337
00:20:14.821 --> 00:20:18.000
I'm kind of emotionally detached.
Right?
Thinks I've set it so much.
Yeah.

338
00:20:18.001 --> 00:20:21.570
I got 26 teeth knocked out with a baseball bat and then that everyone goes,

339
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.830
how did that happen?
And you just almost like that event becomes a bit,

340
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.960
a little bit like something like,

341
00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:31.530
I'm sure when you tell people about being the world judo champ,

342
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:36.420
I'm just never world
making shit up.
Uh,
what,

343
00:20:36.421 --> 00:20:39.620
what you need alcohol.
What were you,
you were like the car.

344
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.490
I won a bunch of taekwondo tournament,

345
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.870
but like I'm sure that somehow you definitely kind of like,
you hear a hum.

346
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.790
<v 3>How flippantly you just said that?
Yeah.
I'm sure it was so long ago,
man.</v>

347
00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:55.210
It doesn't feel like me when I,
when I talk about it quite honestly,

348
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.480
it's so long ago.
It feels like a lie.
Yeah,
I know.

349
00:20:58.481 --> 00:21:01.840
It's real because I can do that stuff still and I'll show people and I go,

350
00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:05.020
Holy Shit.
I go,
yeah.
It's kind of weird.
Right?
I could just do that.

351
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.780
So I know it was real,
but it feels so long ago.
It feels like a lie.
Yeah.

352
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.560
And my brother,
he wants some of this.
Brian.
No good.
Here's your call.

353
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:20.650
This is going downhill or uphill when you're something crazy,

354
00:21:20.651 --> 00:21:24.430
man.
They're uh,
did you hear about the mall of America?
He would happen.

355
00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.480
There was a black lives matter protest if they shut down the mall of America

356
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.750
during the busiest time of the year,
you know,

357
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:35.500
thousands of people chanting and protesting.
Well,
um,

358
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.910
they're getting sued.

359
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.890
The people organize a protest or getting sued and they seek reparations from the

360
00:21:41.891 --> 00:21:45.400
mall of America protest.
The mall is suing him for loss business,

361
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.700
which is significant.
You know,

362
00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:51.340
like this is a very interesting man.

363
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.910
<v 4>It's like these guys that are like protesting by going in the middle of the</v>

364
00:21:54.911 --> 00:21:58.330
freeway here in Los Angeles.
That pisses me off.
Yeah,

365
00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.230
<v 3>we talked about the other day because I think that you can't,
you gotta be real.</v>

366
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:06.250
Oh,
you weren't here,
the Casper and one,
you gotta be careful because you could,

367
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.300
somebody could die.

368
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.710
Like there could be someone who's on their way to the hospital and you,

369
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.410
you block off the ambulance and because the hospital gets in there an hour later

370
00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:17.530
than they should have,
the guy dies.
And that could be someone's loved ones.

371
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.430
That's fucked up.
That's just,
that's not cool.
It's and people like,

372
00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:24.400
well you know it's a protest and protest or not supposed to be convenient.

373
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.350
There's one thing where it's convenient.

374
00:22:26.351 --> 00:22:29.440
It's another thing where it's public safety.
You know,
you could all,

375
00:22:29.441 --> 00:22:33.580
everyone who's involved in that essentially could be charged with murder.

376
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.530
Like if if you in some way cause someone's death because of negligence or

377
00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:40.780
because of a malicious activity where they could,

378
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.380
couldn't decided malicious activity.
I bet it there could be an argument made.

379
00:22:44.381 --> 00:22:46.420
I mean if you,
it was one person physically,

380
00:22:46.421 --> 00:22:50.290
if you knew that there was an ambulance and you blocked it off cause you say no,

381
00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:54.070
the ambulance can't get through because a black lives matter or whatever your

382
00:22:54.071 --> 00:22:58.180
causes.
If you stop that ambulance from going somewhere,
you personally,

383
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.310
they would charge you for sure with something,

384
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.780
whether it would be murder or some negligent homicide or something.

385
00:23:04.781 --> 00:23:06.820
I mean they would figure out,
I don't know what the costs would be.

386
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.870
So the question becomes when you have a whole group of people that are blocking

387
00:23:10.871 --> 00:23:12.910
off the highway,
how many of those people responsible,

388
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.070
cause there's this weird thing that happens,

389
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.280
diffusion of responsibility when you get large numbers.

390
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.960
It's one of the reasons why a mob mentalities are so scary because no one feels

391
00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:26.590
responsible when everything's going crazy and people just run around smashing

392
00:23:26.591 --> 00:23:29.740
windows and like you gotta be really careful about people in that kind of shit

393
00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:34.090
happens because when no one feels like there's any order and everyone feels like

394
00:23:34.091 --> 00:23:37.810
this chaos,
people just start doing shit.
They start looting.

395
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:41.350
I mean that's where you get like these crazy mass rapes where everybody's like,

396
00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:43.810
how is this possible?
Like you hear about them in India,

397
00:23:43.811 --> 00:23:46.520
we're hundred guys rape woman and the woman dies.

398
00:23:46.521 --> 00:23:47.960
Like how the fuck could this happen?

399
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:53.440
Well I think that people have a weird follow mentality then some weird ancient

400
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.580
primate shit that's in us where we follow other people.

401
00:23:58.581 --> 00:24:02.510
Even when things get crazy and when things get completely off the rails.

402
00:24:02.511 --> 00:24:06.830
Fucking crazy.
Like a riot.
I think it's almost like for whatever reason,

403
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:07.730
people,

404
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:12.080
a certain amount of them at least glues themselves in those moments and they
can,

405
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.910
they could stomp people to death too.

406
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:17.180
They could light things on fire to where they would never do that individually

407
00:24:17.181 --> 00:24:19.350
on their own.
And I think,
um,

408
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.810
you have to wonder when you have a situation where a whole group of people do
it,

409
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.360
but that's not there.
I mean they,

410
00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:30.570
they block off traffic but their intention is not to stop ambulances or to stop

411
00:24:30.571 --> 00:24:34.370
police.
Their intention is just for good,
you know,

412
00:24:34.371 --> 00:24:36.440
their intention is to try to put,

413
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:41.830
put the message out there in big letters as possible to let everybody know we're

414
00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:43.970
going to inconvenience the fuck out of,
you know,

415
00:24:43.971 --> 00:24:48.260
more highways like until there's some action,
until someone does something.

416
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.450
The problem is we need those goddamn roads.

417
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:55.310
That's something that you can't take that away that,
I mean,
you're right.

418
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:57.800
I never thought about what if someone's just on their way to the hospital as the

419
00:24:57.801 --> 00:25:00.650
first thing I thought of because I had to take my daughter to hospital recently.

420
00:25:00.651 --> 00:25:04.790
She broke her arm,
fell off the monkey bars and broke her arm.
So when,

421
00:25:04.791 --> 00:25:08.480
when that kind of shit happens and you realize like time is of the essence and

422
00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:11.900
you know my daughter's case,
it's a broken arm.
They know how to fix that stuff.

423
00:25:11.901 --> 00:25:15.350
But in some people's cases it's like,
you know you have organ malfunction.

424
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.740
There's all sorts of things that happened to people's bodies that they can
catch.

425
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:20.870
They can catch in time,
you can stay alive.

426
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:24.950
But imagine how upset you'd be if you never get to talk to your dad again

427
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.430
because some fucking hipsters are blocking off the highway,
you know,

428
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.130
cause they want to show how down they weren't.

429
00:25:30.131 --> 00:25:32.690
So they're blocking off the highway.
That's where I become a single shooter,

430
00:25:32.691 --> 00:25:36.530
Mark Walberg well I know that what they're trying to do as good,

431
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.300
I know what they're trying to do is good.
But there there's a,

432
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:41.900
there's a reality to protesting where he got to go.
Okay,

433
00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:45.380
but at what cost at the cost of your fellow citizens,

434
00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:48.820
like these aren't cops you're talking about that you're inconveniencing or,

435
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.160
or possibly putting their lives in danger.
This is your neighbors.

436
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.120
This is your friend's.
Imagine a few words.
Your nextdoor neighbor major,

437
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.060
if you were a protester,

438
00:25:56.061 --> 00:25:58.640
he next door neighbor's husband had a heart attack and they're trying to get him

439
00:25:58.641 --> 00:26:00.350
to the hospital,
but they couldn't get into any time.
They were like,

440
00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:02.570
if you just got him here half an hour earlier,
we'd have been fine,

441
00:26:02.571 --> 00:26:05.000
but it was 90 minutes it took to get them to the hospital.

442
00:26:05.001 --> 00:26:09.500
So the guy died and she's crying and crying and you're out there trying to say,

443
00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:11.960
hey,
you know,
black lives matter.
It's important that you know,

444
00:26:11.961 --> 00:26:15.830
we make it inconvenient and she's like,
you fuck my husband's dead now.

445
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.400
Everybody's lives matter.
Yeah.
It's just that's the only,

446
00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:24.290
the only other than inconveniencing all the other fellow citizens which don't

447
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:26.600
have anything to do with police brutality,

448
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.880
it's like it seems like there should be,

449
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.660
there should be a way to do it where it doesn't put other people in jeopardy.

450
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.250
I don't know what that way is.
You know?

451
00:26:34.251 --> 00:26:38.690
I would imagine that way is blocking off the front door to the police station or

452
00:26:38.691 --> 00:26:41.780
blocking off even better the flow front,
front door to town hall.

453
00:26:41.781 --> 00:26:42.830
That would be the best one.

454
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.040
Like if they were going to protest something and be heard and be,
you know,

455
00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:48.360
be seen as they're getting arrested,

456
00:26:48.361 --> 00:26:51.210
like some block block off where the laws are being made.

457
00:26:51.211 --> 00:26:54.930
Don't block off the fucking highways,
be smart about it,
find your angle.

458
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.250
But I don't know man.
It's,
it's part of me likes that this is going on though,

459
00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.820
you know,
pro.
Pardon me.
He's excited that there's all this talk.

460
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.640
They'll just like,
people are realizing there's some imbalance,

461
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.140
there's some issues,
you know,

462
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.420
and they're being addressed in like a really big way.

463
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:14.720
So I feel like it's ultimately a lot of good is coming out of all of this stuff.

464
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.350
A lot of good,
you know,

465
00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:19.440
a lot of people are being forced to have these conversations and I've,

466
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:23.890
I've seen people adjust their,
their,
uh,
opinions during these conversations.

467
00:27:23.891 --> 00:27:24.724
It's kind of interesting.

468
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.150
<v 2>I think I've just adjusted my opinions throughout the entire thing.
Cause I,</v>

469
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.640
you know,
I,
the only thing that this,
that,

470
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.000
that I guess arguably be arguably Fox News and CNN don't do,

471
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.830
is they don't offer a,

472
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:42.300
like a real fair and balanced kind of conversation with two intelligent people.

473
00:27:42.301 --> 00:27:45.840
They,
they buttload it where they get like they get on,
they get,

474
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.810
they did this thing with Charles Barkley being in TV as long as I have,
I,

475
00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:50.850
there are certain things I know don't fucking happen.

476
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:52.110
And they bring Charles Barkley,

477
00:27:52.111 --> 00:27:56.670
the one guy that maybe can give a really interesting point of view and he starts

478
00:27:56.671 --> 00:28:00.990
sweating in the interview.
Did you see it anywhere else in an interview on TV?

479
00:28:00.991 --> 00:28:03.630
They would stop down and say,
you look a little shiny,

480
00:28:03.631 --> 00:28:05.460
let's dry dry you off anywhere else.

481
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:09.390
But they allowed it to go and like this Nixon Kennedy debate kind of way and he

482
00:28:09.391 --> 00:28:10.590
had sweat on top of his lip.

483
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:14.070
It was porn off side of his head as he was talking about something that is maybe

484
00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:17.430
not,
uh,
the,
the high road or not the,
not the high road,

485
00:28:17.431 --> 00:28:18.960
but like what the status quo is,

486
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:24.030
but CNN w or I think it was CNN wanted the drama of it.

487
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.280
They wanted his statements.
Do I have weight with this,

488
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.170
with this sweaty persona of like,

489
00:28:28.171 --> 00:28:31.590
I'm fucking scared and the any in any interview,

490
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.620
and I'm sure this has happened to you,
they will stop you down and go stop.

491
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.660
No matter what.
He's a little shiny.
Let's try him off.

492
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.870
Like if you started sweating in,
in like a,

493
00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.030
in like an interview about the UFC and it was just,
you were just talking,
right.

494
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.910
They definitely stop you down and go,
let's give him a little powder.
They don't,

495
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.590
I don't let them do that really.

496
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.440
But if you started sweating when you think they'd let you dry off or you have

497
00:28:52.441 --> 00:28:54.560
say,
dude,
but yeah,
maybe that's a bad fucking,

498
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.420
I feel like such a pussy if I let them powder my forehead.

499
00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.250
It has a bad fucking example.

500
00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:01.520
<v 3>Girls are getting their ears broken off.</v>

501
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:07.580
You see that this girl got her ear ear was destroyed.
Jessica,

502
00:29:07.581 --> 00:29:11.720
I and I've,
I forget the lady's name.
I'll find it here.
Oh,
it exploded.

503
00:29:11.721 --> 00:29:15.750
It was insane.
Did you see a prion hall?

504
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:20.930
It was the fucking craziest Shit I've ever seen in all my years of watching.

505
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:22.640
Well,
one of the cray Leslie Smith,

506
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.420
she fought Leslie Smith who's tough as shit and cheat her ear.

507
00:29:26.421 --> 00:29:28.400
Swole up and she had a,
you know,

508
00:29:28.401 --> 00:29:32.540
cauliflower ear and what cauliflower ear is the reason why your ear gets hard is

509
00:29:32.541 --> 00:29:35.330
your,
when you have bleeding under the skin,

510
00:29:35.331 --> 00:29:39.050
the blood pools under the skin and then it calcifies it hardens up.

511
00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.920
It becomes like a little piece hard.

512
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.980
Like I have some on my knuckle and I have a little bit on my ear.

513
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:47.650
It's real weird.
I wear ear guard so I don't get it on my ear.

514
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.980
But some people liked the way it looks,
so they don't wear ear guards.

515
00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:53.110
They let it fucks with your hearing too.

516
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.630
I mean it makes you look like a bad ass I guess,
but it it,

517
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.690
it fucks with the way you hear things like your ears designed.

518
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:03.580
So that sound hits that,
that shape and like that's why women can't hear Shit,

519
00:30:03.581 --> 00:30:07.060
dude.
They're ears are covered with hair.
They don't know what's going on.

520
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.900
They don't hear you when you're talking to them.
That's what's happening here.

521
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:16.060
I don't mean this,
these are jokes,
but this woman,
anyway,

522
00:30:16.061 --> 00:30:18.550
Leslie Smith had a,
she had some series,

523
00:30:18.551 --> 00:30:22.630
cauliflower ear and must've had some actual bleeding in the ear while the fight

524
00:30:22.631 --> 00:30:27.490
was going on and then she got hit with this punch and it fucking explodes like a

525
00:30:27.491 --> 00:30:30.970
jelly doughnut that got hit with a rifle.
I thought it ripped her ear off.

526
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:34.390
That's what it looked like.
It ripped a rear off and no,
it almost did that.

527
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.950
But it exploded first.
And as you can see it,
pull it up,
pull up,

528
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:43.280
pull up Leslie Smith,
exploding ear Gif because a,

529
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.430
it's crazy to say I've never seen anything like it.

530
00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.720
She got Jessica hit her with his punch and as her knuckle connects with the ear,

531
00:30:49.721 --> 00:30:53.770
the ear just explodes in a cartoonish spray of blood.

532
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:58.660
Like if it was in like one of those sin city,
those movies,
you know,

533
00:30:58.661 --> 00:31:02.470
everything's very cartoony nations.
Yeah.
It didn't look real.

534
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.540
Like if it was in a movie.
Yeah,
it was in a movie.

535
00:31:05.541 --> 00:31:07.690
You had to go get the fuck out of here.
I've never seen it.

536
00:31:07.691 --> 00:31:11.620
You're blowup like that.
Watch this man.
It's,
it's so crazy.

537
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:16.780
Watch this.
It's low resolution.

538
00:31:16.781 --> 00:31:18.910
Unfortunately.
You got to see it.

539
00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:23.380
I'm not on these goofy screens where we have a new system that's in,
uh,

540
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.160
in order right now and the new system will be a tri caster.

541
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.780
We're going to use a tri county.
You can't really see it here.
Can you see it?

542
00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.890
I can see it.
It's hard to see with this low resolution,

543
00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:35.410
but in high resolution it looks fucking insane.

544
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:37.420
<v 2>It's interesting that wrestlers and fighters,</v>

545
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.870
they want the cauliflower flower ear.
Not all of them,
but uh,

546
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.470
they want the cauliflower ear.
I think I talked to Matt Brown about it.

547
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.120
I think my brown has got it.
And I said,

548
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.460
isn't that something you guys want to when you're younger?
And he was like,

549
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.350
fuck no.
But I guess some guys,

550
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.720
<v 3>some guys do well I know people who have actually given it to themselves,</v>

551
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.270
they've taken a belt and they fucked their ear up.

552
00:31:57.271 --> 00:32:01.560
If you bend your ear and you just take a belt and fuck with it.
Yeah,

553
00:32:01.561 --> 00:32:03.750
people liked the way it looks.
It makes you look like a Badass.

554
00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.980
I've met guys who were fucking white belt to have this horrible cauliflower all

555
00:32:07.981 --> 00:32:10.320
over their ears and a,
you're like,
come on man,

556
00:32:10.321 --> 00:32:12.570
I've been doing Jujitsu for 20 years.
I don't have that shit.

557
00:32:12.571 --> 00:32:15.780
How do you have that show so early?
Like how'd you get it so early?
And you know,

558
00:32:15.781 --> 00:32:19.820
you find out that they did a lot of wrestling or they did a lot of,
uh,
you know,

559
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:24.390
horsing around with their friends and if you have the genetic predisposition to

560
00:32:24.391 --> 00:32:28.050
getting cauliflower,
apparently it happened super easy.
Some people,

561
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.170
even though they've been doing Jujitsu for a long time,

562
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.980
like John Jacques Machado has so little of it,

563
00:32:31.981 --> 00:32:35.220
but he's been doing Jujitsu his whole life and he doesn't wear rash cards.

564
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.390
Isn't there a way to,

565
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.620
isn't there a way to prevent it by draining it or something?
Once you got the,

566
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:44.420
you could drain it.
My,
yeah,
my friend Brent had his fixed,
he had um,

567
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:49.220
he had his ear filleted open and they scrape it all out and then stitch it back

568
00:32:49.221 --> 00:32:52.420
together again.
He had it fixed and it looks weird.
The,

569
00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:55.760
his ear looks like a little Collie flowery,
but not much.

570
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.800
But apparently it was pretty bad.
It was like,

571
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.520
like some of the wrestlers like Randy coture has like mice grown into year.
It's,

572
00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.630
Randy's is so bad that I would,
I got to look at it like,

573
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:10.280
and it was like a pinhole.
This is your whole,
yeah,
it's really tiny.

574
00:33:10.281 --> 00:33:14.890
Like he can't even get those apple ear buds are fucked.
Not Kidding.
He can't.

575
00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:20.180
So w w why wouldn't he?
Because he's a bad ass.

576
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.700
He's fucking Randy coture once.
Let everybody know,
bitch,
I,

577
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.760
I'm again in the headlock since I was a baby.
So they said,

578
00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.310
we don't want to fall asleep on planes also.
Well,
they're hard.

579
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.300
He uses him in wrestling.
Yeah,
he,
he holds onto you.

580
00:33:32.301 --> 00:33:35.420
Like if he's got you and he's driving forward towards your face,

581
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:39.020
he'll like shoved that fucking ear and your eyeball.
It's hard.

582
00:33:39.021 --> 00:33:42.080
So just kind of said it doesn't hurt him.
If it hurts him,

583
00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:44.840
he doesn't care if it hurts you.
That's what he worked.

584
00:33:44.841 --> 00:33:48.500
He's worried about if it hurts him slightly less and it hurts you slightly more,

585
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.580
he's going to do it.
That's what's,

586
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:56.150
<v 1>that's what it's like.
You can't,
I can't,
I mean,
I'm around it all this time.</v>

587
00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.630
I'm good.
The exact opposite.
Exactly.

588
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:03.250
If it hurts you more or less than it hurts.
I don't want,
I'm fucking,

589
00:34:03.251 --> 00:34:04.084
I could never be,
that

590
00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.800
<v 3>is the thing about wrestlers that a lot of people don't understand.</v>

591
00:34:06.801 --> 00:34:11.690
It's not just the fact that wrestling is a good base for martial arts,

592
00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.531
for mixed martial arts.

593
00:34:12.531 --> 00:34:15.950
I think it's the best because you could decide whether the fight goes to the

594
00:34:15.951 --> 00:34:19.130
ground or the fight stands up and when you're really good grappler like Jujitsu

595
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:22.190
techniques,
you can learn all those and you can learn all those pretty quickly.

596
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:27.520
It's like the real deal is learning how to manipulate bodies and balance and

597
00:34:27.621 --> 00:34:28.790
understanding,
positioning,

598
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:31.760
understanding like leverage and positioning and wrestlers get that.

599
00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:35.900
But the real intense thing about wrestlers with separates them from other

600
00:34:35.901 --> 00:34:38.520
athletes is the toughness like that.

601
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:42.800
You have to be so fucking tough to survive in a wrestling room.
There's the,

602
00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.530
the drills are so brutal.
The sport itself,

603
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:50.770
like going at it like full clip with another guy who's also the same weight as

604
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.540
you.
Also just as strong as you.

605
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.530
It's one of the most difficult things in all sports.

606
00:34:54.531 --> 00:34:59.531
So you could do to physically strong wrestlers with technique or just fucking

607
00:35:00.591 --> 00:35:03.140
hammering it,
try and take each other.
John Sprawling,

608
00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.460
trying to twist under each other,

609
00:35:04.461 --> 00:35:08.570
trying to throw each other and you just constantly pushing each other to the

610
00:35:08.571 --> 00:35:12.200
limit.
And if you can just get one mile an hour fast and this motherfucker,

611
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:13.243
you could break him.

612
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:17.210
Just make him go one mile an hour faster than he's comfortable with and keep

613
00:35:17.211 --> 00:35:18.200
pushing and pushing and pushing.

614
00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:23.420
So all the best wrestlers have this insane mental toughness is an innate or

615
00:35:23.421 --> 00:35:25.250
trained,
trained 100%.

616
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:29.990
All of it is trained and people have a certain amount of determination,
but when,

617
00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.080
one of the things you see when you see children is how children react to their

618
00:35:33.081 --> 00:35:37.770
environment and stimulation and when it's something as extreme and as the

619
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:42.690
ability to endure pain and the ability to push themselves and it's prevalent all

620
00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:46.620
throughout this one group of athletes,
you got to go,
well,
what's the practice?

621
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.540
It's what they're doing.
Like what are they doing?

622
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:51.570
They're making many of these fucking guys,
they're turning them into animals.

623
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.690
They're turning into people of extreme character like they can do things that it

624
00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.300
doesn't mean other people can't do it.
There's,

625
00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:02.330
there's guys that never wrestled who became mixed martial arts greats that also

626
00:36:02.341 --> 00:36:04.170
have that same mantra like George Saint Pierre.
It's perfect.

627
00:36:04.171 --> 00:36:08.070
Example became a great wrestler after he was already a UFC fighter.

628
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:12.500
It became one of the best wrestlers in MMA just by being a great martial artist.

629
00:36:12.501 --> 00:36:16.530
But he had that mentality on his own and he didn't have to go to a wrestling

630
00:36:16.531 --> 00:36:20.370
room his whole life to develop that.
He developed that from martial arts itself,

631
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.880
but you get a lot more of those in wrestling,
wrestling and get it.

632
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.040
You get a lot of them.
You get like one in every town,

633
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.250
every fucking wrestling team.
In My,
uh,
in my high school,

634
00:36:29.251 --> 00:36:31.590
there was this kid mark calling and he was just,

635
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.780
he was a little bit lighter than me.
He's a really skinny guy.

636
00:36:33.781 --> 00:36:37.540
He said smoke cigarettes in between breaks while we were wrestling or less

637
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.860
wrestling in the winter,
his girlfriend would meet him at the fucking side door,

638
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:43.590
the wrestling room,
and give him a cigarette.
He would take,

639
00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:44.980
drag a cigarette and come in and wrestling,

640
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.050
beat everybody's ass and he smelled like cigarettes.
He's an animal.

641
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.070
He was an animal and he was a,

642
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.870
he was a couple of years older than me and he had been wrestling a good chunk of

643
00:36:54.871 --> 00:36:58.770
his life and a on their,
forget this one day the coach,
uh,

644
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.640
like was as this guy was just smashing everybody,
the coach said,

645
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:07.680
pay attention to him because there's a guy like him and every fucking wrestling

646
00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:08.280
room,

647
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.400
there's a guy like him on every wrestling team and he wasn't the biggest guy by

648
00:37:11.401 --> 00:37:13.680
any stretch of the imagination,
but everybody was scared of him.

649
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.110
Everybody was scared of him.
Even the heavier wrestlers,

650
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.200
like he was like the captain of the team when he get mad at them for being a

651
00:37:19.201 --> 00:37:22.410
pussy,
you know,
yell at them.
They'd just fucking bow their head down.

652
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.340
They just didn't want him,

653
00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:25.380
nothing to do with this little fucking Tasmanian Devil.

654
00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:30.750
He was just a whirlwind guy,
which is so aggressive.
And those guys,

655
00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:34.530
there's like,
and he got beat.
He went to the fucking the states and he got beat.

656
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.350
I watched him lose.
The guys were even better than him.
I was like,
this is crazy.

657
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:40.950
This born like you,
you're going deep,
deep,
deep into the savage chain.

658
00:37:40.951 --> 00:37:44.490
You're getting these fucking barbarians that are there.

659
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.780
Their DNA is so fucking good,
like their genetics are so good.

660
00:37:48.781 --> 00:37:49.770
And then on top of that,

661
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.160
they're being trained to this really insane way where they're overtraining them

662
00:37:53.161 --> 00:37:54.600
every day,
every day they're tired.

663
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:58.350
Everyday you're making exhausted kids run up hills and carry the kids on their

664
00:37:58.351 --> 00:38:02.430
back and run.
Firemen carry drills.
You're doing fucking stairs with them.

665
00:38:02.431 --> 00:38:04.440
You're carrying your friends where you're climbing up stairs,

666
00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:06.090
doing all kinds of crazy shit.

667
00:38:06.091 --> 00:38:09.680
You're walking on your hands back and forth across the fucking wrestling room.

668
00:38:09.681 --> 00:38:13.140
You doing all these insane drills and you're going at it for hours a day in a

669
00:38:13.141 --> 00:38:15.360
room.
That muscle likely has this best in it.

670
00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.310
This is fucking pipes are covered in this.

671
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:20.850
I mean this is 1981 when I was wrestling and I need to,

672
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.160
and these pipes are all covered in this fucking spray,

673
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.060
serious foamy shit that's dropping out of the restroom.

674
00:38:27.061 --> 00:38:30.000
You got to kick it off to the side like is this stuff safe?

675
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.060
Like we are going to have cancer when we're old.
But um,

676
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.620
first blowjob ever got was in a,
uh,
a wrestling room.

677
00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.940
<v 1>I know.
Make the dude take off.
Is here guards that your coach with a year,</v>

678
00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:43.170
God's help.
Do they help while dude sucking your Dick?
Yeah.
Good handle on it.

679
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.840
You don't
match.
If you took your check and you were like,

680
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:51.841
you put these on once you put the ear guards on why she said just need them.

681
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:56.810
I need them on you.
I mean with this thing lit up.
Yeah,

682
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.260
put this thing and on it make you check where a single,

683
00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:01.690
put your titties outside this thing.
When I left one titty here went to the,

684
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:03.310
they're all crazy style.

685
00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:11.320
I'm well past that.
That fed that role play.
What are you intellect?

686
00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:14.980
Lumberjack shit.
Listen,
I'm,
I'm walking down the woods.

687
00:39:14.981 --> 00:39:19.780
I'm a hiker and you're a lumber jacker and shit just gets crazy.

688
00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.740
The only female lumber jacker the Yukon,

689
00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.100
the guys left you behind and just been searching for that right guy.

690
00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.090
Today's the day you just decided,
you woke up this morning.
Fucking,

691
00:39:34.091 --> 00:39:35.140
I'm tired of being a virgin.

692
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.950
And then along comes Bert Kreischer the world traveler.

693
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:45.820
He's just a few minutes ahead of the trip flip team.
So he,
he's like,

694
00:39:45.821 --> 00:39:46.750
I'm totally willing to fuck you,

695
00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:50.110
but I'm doing this TV show for the child shall and there's a bunch of people

696
00:39:50.111 --> 00:39:52.860
behind me and they're on vacation.
They're taking pictures.
That's why I'm a hand.

697
00:39:52.861 --> 00:39:55.240
I'm supposed to scout ahead.
We can fuck,
but we gotta fuck really quick.

698
00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:00.130
And this girl's first sexual experience.

699
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.260
Do you get to that deep level of a fantasy go so fucking funny.

700
00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:09.160
That's an area where I've done,
not with wanting to fuck a chick,

701
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:13.720
but rolled up to a lumber jack who was a female with the triplet Google that

702
00:40:13.721 --> 00:40:17.170
really did happen.
The hottest shit she was Holly shit,

703
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.690
it's so crazy that you even made that in my head.
I was like,
cause I,

704
00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.260
first thing I thought was a lumberjack hand job from a check will be insane.
Wow.

705
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:30.010
Fucking just rough hands.
And then I thought I'd like that.

706
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:35.200
That'd be confusing.
I definitely didn't close my eyes.
I have to look cute.

707
00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:41.440
You're definitely a chick,
right?
Hey,

708
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.750
no tricks.
No,
I wouldn't even,
not one eye.
Both eyes bro.
Looking right at them.

709
00:40:46.751 --> 00:40:51.190
Very,
very intense.
Trusting someone holding on your balls and Dick like that.

710
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.450
The rough hands,
wood chips and their fingernails and stuff.

711
00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:00.990
The scent of pine all over their clothes.
When we were up in Canada,

712
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.380
we pass by these,
um,
they have these uh,

713
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:09.760
cut breaks where there's like these areas that they cut all the trees down.

714
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.190
It's really weird man.
It's like,
cause you,

715
00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.730
you go and you're driving down the road and you see like just beautiful trees

716
00:41:15.731 --> 00:41:19.690
and it's amazing.
And then you'll hit this area.
Many football fields,

717
00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:23.830
large just enormous area where it's all trees chopped down,

718
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:26.190
everything's chopped down and um,

719
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:31.320
some of it is piled up and then they have a few posts that they leave like out

720
00:41:32.291 --> 00:41:34.040
there in the middle,
like trees

721
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.440
<v 3>at elect cut in half and they leave out there in the middle.</v>

722
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.990
And they do that for the birds.

723
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.830
They do that for the bird population because in order to,

724
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:46.190
it actually enhances the bird's ability to be a predator.

725
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:49.970
But like for Raptors,
hawks,
shit like that.
Eagles,

726
00:41:49.971 --> 00:41:53.510
they have eagles up there for those animals.
They uh,
they want,

727
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.770
they need purchase in order to be able to look down and see all the different

728
00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:00.290
rabbits and rats and all the different shit they're going to eat.

729
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:02.810
So if you make this huge cut,
break,

730
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.040
you cut down a bunch of trees and just leave nowhere where they can sit up.

731
00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.110
They are only going to kill the things that are around the edges.

732
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.080
They're not going to see like a lot of the shit that's out there in the middle.

733
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.980
So they place these like posts to make it easier for these birds.

734
00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:20.180
It's really weird.
It's very weird.
It's crazy that someone figured that out.

735
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:25.170
I think biologists get involved every step of the way when it comes to,
uh,

736
00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.930
where you're allowed to cut,
what,
how much you're allowed to cut a,

737
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.620
what animal is going to be affected.
Like,

738
00:42:30.621 --> 00:42:33.560
do you remember when they had that owl thing?
There was a thing about,

739
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:38.420
there was an owl problem.
Do remember that.
And they had to shut down,
um,

740
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:43.250
lumber that,
and it was somewhere in the Pacific northwest spotted owl.
Yeah.

741
00:42:43.251 --> 00:42:48.251
There was a spotted owl issue where they were going extinct and so people were

742
00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:52.990
freaking the fuck out because they couldn't make it make money.
Uh,

743
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:56.630
while this,
um,
this thing was going on,

744
00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:01.790
um,
here,
I'll put it down in lumber,
lumber shut down.

745
00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.220
But uh,

746
00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.610
that's like one of the things that people are terrified of when they're making

747
00:43:07.611 --> 00:43:11.090
money off the environment.
They're terrified of all.
We found a frog,

748
00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:14.870
a very rare frog within this one pond.
So you've got to stop drilling oil.

749
00:43:14.871 --> 00:43:18.050
Why are you fucking crazy?
It's a frog.

750
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:22.850
We spend $1 billion to get this fucking machinery in here.
We need that oil.

751
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:27.560
And then you start greasing politicians.
Yeah.
The spotted owl,

752
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.770
they shut down,
uh,
the,
the Pacific northwest,
they shut down,

753
00:43:32.771 --> 00:43:33.480
um,

754
00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.920
<v 1>timber production.
Really fucking fascinating story.</v>

755
00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.360
It is considering that's everyone's livelihood up there.
Not everyone,

756
00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.910
but a vast majority of some people's livelihood.
Yeah.

757
00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.600
Can consider the the popular,
uh,
the,
the,

758
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.780
what's the guy that gets hired politician who was greenlit,

759
00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.620
that must've known he was getting a shit storm coming his way.

760
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.600
<v 3>I'm sure they probably get death threats.</v>

761
00:43:58.601 --> 00:44:03.100
Like if you come out and say you don't want them to make millions and millions

762
00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.750
of dollars every week because of our fucking

763
00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:08.330
<v 1>bird to do two aren't really giving a fuck about birds.</v>

764
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.780
Not to say don't give a fuck about burns.
If they gave a fuck about birds,

765
00:44:11.781 --> 00:44:13.700
it wouldn't be chopping down trees had find a better job.

766
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:20.010
<v 5>If you were in that because you were like super into birds,
that's the wrong job.</v>

767
00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.220
So in the wrong job,
wrong job

768
00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.570
as your high school guidance counselor,

769
00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:37.903
really

770
00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:44.060
<v 3>this guy is writing,
this guy's running a Sawyer,
a story.
William Dietrich,</v>

771
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:49.270
I'm saying that he was trying to talk to the Seattle Times about this in 1988.

772
00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:53.990
And uh,
they thought he was crazy.
They were laughing at him.
They were like,

773
00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:58.400
this is this like this is a ridiculous notion.
You're telling us that a bird,

774
00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:02.000
an obscure bird,
apparently it's not a very common bird that no one,

775
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:05.240
none of these people had ever seen would be enough to shut down the Pacific

776
00:45:05.241 --> 00:45:08.630
northwest biggest industry and that's really what happened.

777
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.700
It's really interesting how that works,
man.

778
00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.240
Really interesting how that works because I think there's,

779
00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.960
there's a lot of people that get really upset about logging in the first place.

780
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.080
<v 2>Let's do this.</v>

781
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.620
Let's take that same subject and do what you did with the black lives matter

782
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:27.770
with the protest because arguably for this one bird says dad's going to lose his

783
00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:32.640
job and he's not going to have the means to support his family the way he had

784
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:37.140
and may lose his house over a bird.
Is that worth it?

785
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.053
<v 3>Well,</v>

786
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:44.130
I don't think that we should want and Lee cause the extinction of an animal told

787
00:45:44.131 --> 00:45:46.170
when an animal is a part of the ecosystem.

788
00:45:46.171 --> 00:45:49.200
Do I think that ecosystem will survive?
Yes.
You know why?

789
00:45:49.201 --> 00:45:52.680
Because I think that ecosystems are way more flexible than we want to think they

790
00:45:52.681 --> 00:45:54.960
are.
I think they do adjust and survive,

791
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.620
but if we can prevent this animal from dying,

792
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.230
then we should definitely prevent this animal from going extinct.

793
00:46:01.231 --> 00:46:04.250
I mean it just seems like if we're going to be,
you know,

794
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:08.610
humans like to be thought of as the caretakers of the earth or the curators of

795
00:46:08.611 --> 00:46:13.560
the earth.
Let's start that with Americans.
Not Humans.
Yeah.
Americans.
We always,

796
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:13.891
you know,

797
00:46:13.891 --> 00:46:18.891
when you look at our concern with global pandemics and global warming,

798
00:46:20.251 --> 00:46:20.990
climate change,

799
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:24.600
all the different issues that people are very concerned about our role in

800
00:46:24.601 --> 00:46:25.440
protecting the earth.

801
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:31.550
But if we're doing that and then we have some crazy fucking bird that's dying

802
00:46:32.371 --> 00:46:35.940
off because we like to chop down trees like it seems like they should figure out

803
00:46:35.941 --> 00:46:36.960
a way to save that bird.

804
00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:41.250
It seems like this should be a way to get that bird and put them in an awesome

805
00:46:41.251 --> 00:46:44.640
bird place just to let them fuck like crazy.
Go look dude,

806
00:46:44.641 --> 00:46:47.220
we got all the fucking mice you ever want.

807
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:51.060
We're gonna like let Mike's out every day.
You fuck like crazy.

808
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.610
You make a bunch of out of the owls and we'll get your populations healthy and

809
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.400
let you go.
It seems like that would be like a good move.
Right?

810
00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:03.910
<v 2>Why not charge those lumber industries instead of shutting down everything?</v>

811
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:05.710
Say Keep because they're going to go extinct.

812
00:47:05.711 --> 00:47:08.290
I think they were worried that these things are going to go extinct.
Oh,
so,

813
00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.760
so it's not just about money,

814
00:47:09.761 --> 00:47:13.180
it's about this actual area is the only place birds still around?

815
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:17.040
<v 3>Yeah,
it's like a really,
um,
that makes sense to me.
Yeah.
It's a really,</v>

816
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.950
really obscure bird.
Apparently they're not in a lot of places,

817
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.970
but there's a lot of that area up there that's protected.
We went up there,

818
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:27.090
Duncan and I did to look for big foot when we do that.
So fast show stupid.

819
00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.200
It was so silly.

820
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.980
But what sillies how beautiful that area is when you're up in Mount Rainier?

821
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.160
Dude,
it's crazy.
First of all,
it rains every day.

822
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:40.720
So the woods or just like the way I described it was like a box of Q tips like

823
00:47:40.721 --> 00:47:42.010
this.
That's how many trees there are.

824
00:47:42.011 --> 00:47:47.011
There were just trees upon trees upon trees and everything is so green and it

825
00:47:48.551 --> 00:47:51.040
always looks kind of cool but it's always raining.

826
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.650
But then every now and then for like an hour or so,

827
00:47:53.651 --> 00:47:55.870
the sun will break through the clouds.
When we were there,

828
00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:59.830
we were there in May and it was uh,
still pretty remar march,

829
00:47:59.831 --> 00:48:03.970
March one of those one m month where there during an m a month.
And um,

830
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:08.170
one time during the day the sun broke free for like a couple of hours and I was

831
00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:09.760
like,
this is the most beautiful place on earth.

832
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:13.060
This is the most like sun was like beams of Sun.

833
00:48:13.061 --> 00:48:16.690
We're cutting through the trees and everything was soaked and do and we were

834
00:48:16.691 --> 00:48:21.691
standing next to a river which had like empty beer cans and shotgun shells all

835
00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:26.020
over the fucking sure like Buckler,
Conte the owls.
But other than that,

836
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:31.330
the view is magnificent.
Like you're looking at such lush,

837
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:35.740
lush greenery.
There's something about that man that like,

838
00:48:35.741 --> 00:48:39.790
it does something to your brain,
like it puts you on a frequency,
like quiet,

839
00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:44.440
calm down bitch.
It just does some click.
It locks into,

840
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:48.460
there's something about your visual,
like the your visual field.

841
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:50.920
You take in this insane,

842
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:55.810
beautiful natural imagery of nature and that it has an effect on the mind and

843
00:48:55.811 --> 00:48:56.644
you sit there and you're like,

844
00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:01.820
<v 2>that is,
I've been obsessed with this theory.</v>

845
00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:06.200
I went to this place called earned slow burn in New Zealand glacier.

846
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:08.300
They shot it in the hobbit is the waterfall.

847
00:49:08.301 --> 00:49:11.960
That photo walks behind and we went into the waterfall,
swim,
the waterfall.
It's,

848
00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:16.820
it's drip off from the glacier.
It was 32 degrees eight seconds ago.
Wow.

849
00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:20.430
And I got there and I was obsessed.
And you know,

850
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:24.680
we talked about this on the phone like a month ago about when you're in comedy

851
00:49:24.681 --> 00:49:27.470
brain,
you're almost like less happy because you can't,

852
00:49:27.471 --> 00:49:30.350
you're obsessing about like when you're writing you're just kind of,

853
00:49:30.351 --> 00:49:32.970
your brain's fucking on it won't shut down.
Right.

854
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:37.820
I was obsessed with the fact that like visually when I was a kid and I saw a

855
00:49:37.821 --> 00:49:40.010
vagina for the first time,
it might be Barry's house.

856
00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.520
I got turned on and I couldn't stop that feeling.
I got,

857
00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:47.840
I got sexually turned on and I couldn't shut that down and I couldn't get my

858
00:49:47.841 --> 00:49:51.380
brain to shut off.
But that,
look at this place earned slow burn.

859
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:56.090
I kept looking at it going,
it's as inspiring as the first Regina ever saw.

860
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:58.100
But what is,
what,
what,

861
00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:01.970
why is it that this has this reaction on me where I tear up and I go,

862
00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:06.310
this is beautiful.
As opposed to getting turned on sexually.
Do you know,

863
00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:09.950
do you know what I mean?
It's visual.
It's the exact same medium.

864
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:15.190
Yeah.
You talking about it,
it brings the opposite.
Almost like the,
the,

865
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.320
all the shit that sexuality does where it shuts your brain down and you just

866
00:50:18.321 --> 00:50:21.520
want to fuck dick gets hard.
It does the opposite where it goes,
I have one.

867
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:24.920
I wish my kids were here.
I wish my wife was here.
Um,
I hope,

868
00:50:24.921 --> 00:50:29.000
I hope my parents are proud,
like all these weird fucking,
but I just,
I was a,

869
00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:30.850
I've been obsessed with that because there,

870
00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.720
there are those things in life and I feel like I've,

871
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:37.550
I've been really lucky to experience them in the past six months in,
in,

872
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:38.780
in spades.

873
00:50:38.781 --> 00:50:43.430
But like those moments where you take visual snapshots and you're like,
oh fuck.

874
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.830
Like when you're by that stream and,
and everything's,

875
00:50:45.831 --> 00:50:48.830
and it stops raining and the sun peaks through and it hits that right moment,

876
00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:51.380
you're like,
oh shit,
I'll never forget this moment.

877
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:56.580
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I think,
um,
there's a reason why people go to art galleries,</v>

878
00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.190
you know,
like,
why do you go to our gallery?

879
00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:03.600
He go there to see what people are capable of creating.
Like there's,
Oh,

880
00:51:03.601 --> 00:51:07.380
it's always inspiring.
Like even like those tattoos we were looking at yesterday,

881
00:51:07.381 --> 00:51:11.310
like,
wow,
somebody did that.
That one,
the Cheshire cat and that chick's ribs.
Like,

882
00:51:11.311 --> 00:51:12.870
whoa,
that's crazy.
Right?

883
00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:17.520
Like I like knowing that someone made us a cool sand castle.
Right.

884
00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:21.840
There's something to that.
But then there's also something about just beauty.

885
00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:25.710
There's something about beauty and beauty.

886
00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:28.380
I think especially in our culture today,

887
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:33.840
it gets co opted by sexual attraction,
you know,

888
00:51:33.841 --> 00:51:36.270
like be like a beautiful woman's body.

889
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:40.590
Like even if for whatever reason you decided you were never going to have sex

890
00:51:40.591 --> 00:51:44.100
for the rest of your life and you were never attracted to a woman again,

891
00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:46.500
you were fine with that for whatever reason.

892
00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:48.900
Like you got hit by lightening and your Dick stop working.

893
00:51:48.901 --> 00:51:51.840
He really didn't care anymore.
You were fine with it.
Like a John Travolta movie.

894
00:51:51.841 --> 00:51:55.890
Out of that,
you saw like a perfect,

895
00:51:55.920 --> 00:52:00.920
beautiful female body with curves and legs and breasts and bone structure and

896
00:52:03.121 --> 00:52:06.180
just femininity.
It's beautiful.

897
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:11.160
Like a woman's body of a woman who is exercising as a healthy,

898
00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:15.150
vibrant body.
It's an amazing thing to behold.
It's,
it's a,
Oh,

899
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:18.090
it's a work of beauty and there's something about it,

900
00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:22.620
not just a sexual attraction to it,
but just the actual shape of it.

901
00:52:22.621 --> 00:52:24.330
The curves,
like you know,

902
00:52:24.331 --> 00:52:28.080
like that stupid Kim Kardashian breaks the Internet thing.

903
00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:32.250
Like when you looked at that,
you're like,
wow,
that's crazy.
Her ass is ridiculous.

904
00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:36.380
But what's,
what's doesn't work is that she's like,

905
00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:40.440
look at me,
luck.
I'm an oil up my ass.

906
00:52:40.441 --> 00:52:45.150
So you luck his rubber in my ass.
Don't tell anyone.
Shh.

907
00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:48.150
Like why is your ass so big?
It wasn't that big at one point in time.

908
00:52:48.151 --> 00:52:52.470
Do you just do a lot of squats
sorta.

909
00:52:52.471 --> 00:52:54.390
It looks like she has a fucking diaper on right?

910
00:52:54.391 --> 00:52:57.660
Sort of like she's got a rubber ass.
This is rubber in there.

911
00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.950
Some sort of foreign.

912
00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:04.190
But what doing is by seeing it in this beautiful form and shape,

913
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:08.280
it's like a sculpture.
There's like something to it,
you know like you're,

914
00:53:08.281 --> 00:53:12.190
you're seeing is,
it's exaggerated and it's,
in her case,

915
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.290
this is not the best case,

916
00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:17.700
but there's been some like insanely beautiful black and white photos of like,

917
00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:19.800
like models on the beach.

918
00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:22.530
You know where you look at these photos and you're like well that's just the

919
00:53:22.531 --> 00:53:25.170
shape of the woman's body is like something.

920
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.720
And then you see like the shape of a mountain,

921
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000
a snow capped mountain with beautiful green trees around it and the sun is like

922
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:37.710
passing through the cheese.
And you're like,
fuck,
that's amazing to look at.

923
00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:40.980
There's something that happens to us when we see beauty

924
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:45.640
<v 1>and when nature compliments beauty.
Like you said,
I believe this,</v>

925
00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:50.440
when the sun peaks through the nature of nature kind of just takes it to the

926
00:53:50.441 --> 00:53:53.980
next level and he's like,
he's like,
he's like,
take this all over your face,

927
00:53:53.981 --> 00:53:56.500
nature of a woman.
It's like squirting.

928
00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:59.160
She's squirting all over the universe that she created.
It's,

929
00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:02.260
it's one of those moments like I woke up in this cave in Vietnam and the sun

930
00:54:02.261 --> 00:54:06.190
came.
How many people are going to say that shined into the cave and say living

931
00:54:06.191 --> 00:54:09.700
people,
I know,
I know.
11

932
00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:16.240
but it's like those moments when nature and beauty and all show up at the same

933
00:54:16.241 --> 00:54:20.700
time and you're like,
oh,
it's like they're talking to me,
you know?
Yeah,
yeah.

934
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:25.190
It's like it's giving you a message.
It's giving you a message.
Like,
behold,

935
00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:27.310
all that I have in sign of me,

936
00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.760
behold the clear water and the fucking bird,

937
00:54:31.761 --> 00:54:36.761
the Chirp in my trees that sit on my mountain then and then when you're doing

938
00:54:36.821 --> 00:54:39.880
your couple of music into it.
Oh yeah.
And in mushrooms.
Right.

939
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:44.710
And if you got alcohol,
you've got to Hud,
Ibrance,
nature,

940
00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:49.660
beauty,
music.
Yeah.
Like I happen to me on airplanes when you just,

941
00:54:49.661 --> 00:54:50.620
when you're the only one awake,

942
00:54:50.621 --> 00:54:53.770
but you open up and the sun's rising over Tokyo and you're like,

943
00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:57.220
and you got fucking something shitty song,

944
00:54:57.221 --> 00:54:59.980
but it doesn't matter cause it just means the right thing to you.

945
00:54:59.981 --> 00:55:04.270
And you're like,
fuck it.
Fuck it.
It's not that.
Hey,
now you're an all star.

946
00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:09.370
Get you came on and you're like,
that's my fucking,
exactly.
Exactly.

947
00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:15.660
Exactly.
Katy Perry's not Katy Perry.
Fucking um,

948
00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:19.270
uh,
the girl with the,

949
00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:25.140
it feels like a perfect night to dress up like hit or hip flares.

950
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:30.450
What fucking Hitler?
Jesus Christ.
Bert Kreischer
uh,

951
00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.360
come on.

952
00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:35.830
If the girl that won the fucking Emmy and won the grammy and then it's the one

953
00:55:35.831 --> 00:55:37.720
where everyone's telling me like,
I hate to admit it.

954
00:55:37.721 --> 00:55:41.140
I love this new albums and Katy Perry,
Taylor swift.

955
00:55:41.141 --> 00:55:45.460
Taylor swift is a fucking awesome dude.
If you want to get,

956
00:55:45.461 --> 00:55:47.590
especially hold on.
No,
let me tell you something Joe.
I swear to God,

957
00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:51.970
I swear to God and think about what you're saying.
Your daughter,
your daughters,

958
00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.530
and in two years we'll,

959
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:59.230
we'll change your playlist because you'll hear songs that remind you of them.

960
00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:01.510
Sure.
It happens.
So don't know me

961
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:04.010
<v 3>so wrong.</v>

962
00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:12.350
I have videos.
My daughter's singing that and I think it's awesome,

963
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:16.910
but when I'm in my fucking manly American car,
I don't listen to that horse shit.

964
00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:20.690
What about like now you got,
hold on,
I'm on an airplane.

965
00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:24.490
Dead Lifts and I'm listening to Zeplin fuck off.
I'm on an airplane,

966
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:28.120
<v 2>I'm having a few cocktails.
It's a long flight.
It's an unusual day</v>

967
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:32.083
and

968
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:38.050
that song and you be honest,
you listen to that song a little under listen,

969
00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:38.950
it's on my,
it's on my,

970
00:56:38.951 --> 00:56:41.620
on my phone because my girl take my phone might be dead honest with two

971
00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:44.500
daughters.
You've got a younger and that song.

972
00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.980
Do you build a snow man?

973
00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:51.020
Cause you just think like what if my younger daughter come and I start bawling?

974
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.640
Just sobbing.
I definitely get

975
00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.310
<v 3>when I see things that they like and I'm not around them,
but that's why I don't,</v>

976
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:59.790
I don't stay away for long.

977
00:56:59.791 --> 00:57:02.390
It's like you go away for like these big long stretches.

978
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:05.720
I don't go away for very long the longest ago ways when I go hunting,

979
00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.780
like UFC trips and calming trips is a couple of days at most.

980
00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:11.960
So I don't like going away,
man,
I don't like it.
I don't like that feeling.

981
00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:14.030
It's like when I was a kid,

982
00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:18.140
I didn't have a lot of stability in my life and I think almost none of my

983
00:57:18.141 --> 00:57:22.340
friends did,
which is weird because it's like,
it makes interesting people.

984
00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:23.750
I don't want my kids to be interesting

985
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:30.270
to be fucking boring as shit and happy and content.

986
00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.800
But that's selfish,
right?
I mean it's like I think,
uh,

987
00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:37.400
I will expose them to difficult scenarios in life,

988
00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:42.610
but I want to build a base of love and support first because I recognize

989
00:57:43.081 --> 00:57:44.210
there's,
there's a bunch,

990
00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:47.300
there's a bunch of variables involved in making human being and I think you

991
00:57:47.301 --> 00:57:50.540
probably thought about this as well.
When you think about raising a kid,

992
00:57:50.541 --> 00:57:50.900
you don't,

993
00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:55.900
you don't just a feed them and you know just sort of read books to them before

994
00:57:56.271 --> 00:58:00.050
you go to bed with them.
You have to explain to them life,

995
00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:04.400
you're teaching them about things and you're setting examples and in a lot of

996
00:58:04.401 --> 00:58:07.700
ways it's a huge fucking responsibility like that a lot of people don't really

997
00:58:07.701 --> 00:58:08.130
consider,

998
00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:10.460
you sort of think that your kids are going to figure it out on their own and

999
00:58:10.461 --> 00:58:12.380
they will if you don't help them,

1000
00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:14.570
but you're really supposed to be there to fucking help them.

1001
00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.790
Just like every other animal like cats.

1002
00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:20.550
They'll like hold onto a mouse and they'll drop it near the kit and so the kit

1003
00:58:20.551 --> 00:58:22.190
and we'll chase the mouse and hold on to it.
They're like,

1004
00:58:22.191 --> 00:58:25.760
teach this kitten had a Honda mouse by bringing them a half dead mouse.

1005
00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:27.770
Like cats go and Jack a mouse,

1006
00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:31.550
which picking barely jack them just hold on one and they drop them off in front

1007
00:58:31.551 --> 00:58:34.220
of their kittens.
I've seen him do it.
It's weird.
It's weird to watch,

1008
00:58:34.221 --> 00:58:36.020
but they're teaching,
they're teaching them.

1009
00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:38.720
Some people don't teach their kids Jack Shit.
You know,

1010
00:58:38.721 --> 00:58:42.560
and I think the best teacher in life is adversity.

1011
00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:45.620
The thing is how much adversity you want to give your kids cause you give them

1012
00:58:45.621 --> 00:58:49.850
too much and fucks him up.
If you give them not enough,
they become spoiled.

1013
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:51.770
It's like you have to figure out,

1014
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:56.930
they need to learn to overcome obstacles and it's just like everything else in

1015
00:58:56.931 --> 00:58:58.900
life.
You start with a little obstacle and that obstacle,

1016
00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:01.100
like how do you get to become a really good comic?

1017
00:59:01.101 --> 00:59:04.610
Bert Kreischer you start off at open mic nights.
That's their first obstacle.

1018
00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:07.170
<v 2>Hit on by other comics.</v>

1019
00:59:07.171 --> 00:59:10.950
So you've and you need your heartbroken and your ego's stomped on and you do

1020
00:59:10.951 --> 00:59:13.410
realize how bad you are and need to be objective.

1021
00:59:13.411 --> 00:59:14.550
You need to come to terms with that.

1022
00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:17.070
When you're the back of a taxi with your sister and she came up to see you

1023
00:59:17.071 --> 00:59:19.890
perform in New York and you're sitting there and you're all your things.

1024
00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:22.340
And my sister was so embarrassed to be with me,

1025
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.900
she pulled off that New York taxi cab mask to not look at me.

1026
00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:28.270
<v 3>Oh No.</v>

1027
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:32.880
<v 2>And that you're here.
You want to get worse.
She put it on my good tar.</v>

1028
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:35.550
That's how bad I did guitar.
I did.
I tried to,

1029
00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:40.700
it was the first time I tried to do music and we're talking 1998 and I,

1030
00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:43.560
and she put it all my guitar.
It's still on my guitar case.

1031
00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:44.670
Every time I look at that map,

1032
00:59:44.671 --> 00:59:49.080
I think my sister could not make eye contact with me cause,
but you need that.

1033
00:59:49.081 --> 00:59:54.060
And,
and now here's a question.
How much do you,
how much do you swing that poll?

1034
00:59:54.061 --> 00:59:55.480
Because all the old,

1035
00:59:55.830 --> 00:59:59.310
ultimately you want your daughters to have some of the same brilliant

1036
00:59:59.311 --> 01:00:02.970
experiences you've had in your life where you sit there and,
and not just,

1037
01:00:02.971 --> 01:00:06.180
you know,
cage side at a UFC,
their equivalent of that.

1038
01:00:06.181 --> 01:00:09.990
But like you want them to also feel like they've earned it.
Right.
You know,

1039
01:00:09.991 --> 01:00:14.700
that's the one thing that I'm so grateful about is that,
you know,

1040
01:00:14.701 --> 01:00:19.050
I earned standup comedy.
You know,
like I didn't know I wasn't gifted to me.

1041
01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:22.830
I earned,
I had to work for it and that wasn't my place in life.

1042
01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:27.600
I wasn't a kid that got that earned anything.
I never read books.

1043
01:00:27.601 --> 01:00:31.670
I was just a kid who fucking floated by until I got into comedy.
And I saw,

1044
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:35.550
and I remember seeing guys like Jim Norton going,
Oh shit.
Like he's earned,

1045
01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:38.670
like he's working for this and Bobby Kelly and Pete Ollie,

1046
01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:42.720
these guys were all guys that I was looking at working for it.
And I,
and I did,

1047
01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:46.320
I wanted a shortcut so bad cause that was what life had been.

1048
01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.590
But I looked at them and I was like,
fuck,
I got to work it.

1049
01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.460
I didn't understand that until I worked at door to get on stage.

1050
01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:57.360
And you were like 10 steps below what they had ever seen because no one did
that.

1051
01:00:57.370 --> 01:01:01.020
New York,
you work the door,
Boston comedy club.
And so what year is it?

1052
01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:02.580
Nineties eight 90

1053
01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:03.900
<v 3>so I was already gone.
I wasn't,</v>

1054
01:01:03.901 --> 01:01:05.820
I didn't come back there while you were working there.
How?

1055
01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:10.630
<v 2>No,
no,
but,
but even still like,
you know I had,
you know Jim,</v>

1056
01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:14.650
I see Jim,
I see Jim in New York.
Chris had him on my podcast.

1057
01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:20.110
It's nice to know he's,
I think he's a genius comic,
but we're,

1058
01:01:20.111 --> 01:01:22.180
we're peers in the same business.

1059
01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:26.280
<v 3>Talk about all that.
But to a fucking earned it.</v>

1060
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.710
Like I want my kids to earn shit.
Yeah.

1061
01:01:28.711 --> 01:01:31.590
I don't know how to do that because you can listen.

1062
01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:35.940
You can only lead by example in certain respects.
But what you're saying is true.

1063
01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:39.270
Like one of the things that's weird about being a fuck up in life or being a

1064
01:01:39.271 --> 01:01:41.280
funny person is what you,

1065
01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:44.850
the skill that you developed that people don't think of as marketable or don't

1066
01:01:44.851 --> 01:01:49.020
think of as valuable as you became a very socially viable person.

1067
01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:51.960
You even though you didn't do well in school,

1068
01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:55.080
you were concentrating on other things and one of those other things you were

1069
01:01:55.081 --> 01:01:58.830
concentrating on is a bit in a big way is being amusing to people.

1070
01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.680
Getting people to like you being what your book is called,

1071
01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.420
the life of the fucking party.

1072
01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:06.840
I mean that's what you work but people don't think of that as being a skill but

1073
01:02:06.841 --> 01:02:11.490
of course it's a skill you figured out through a lot of trial and error through

1074
01:02:11.491 --> 01:02:14.100
years of of adjustment,

1075
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:18.960
years of of life interacting with people and realizing what people like.

1076
01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.010
Then once you find it,

1077
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.180
tapping into it and running with it and then using alcohol to fuel it to take

1078
01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:27.960
away your ambitions and run with it.
You're developing a martial art,

1079
01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:30.820
the martial art of comedy.
I mean it's really in a,

1080
01:02:30.821 --> 01:02:35.821
in a way there are analogies to developing a Marshall like becoming like a

1081
01:02:36.361 --> 01:02:41.280
martial artist because one of the things about becoming a martial artist is you

1082
01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:45.660
find the tools that work.
You're taught it more than you are with comedy.
Comedy,

1083
01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:48.360
everybody's different.
Like with martial arts,
you have your basics,

1084
01:02:48.361 --> 01:02:50.730
you have your striking basics,
you have your grappling basics.

1085
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.930
Someone teaches it and then you express yourself and you figure out how,

1086
01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.580
what you're doing,
what works,

1087
01:02:56.581 --> 01:02:59.130
what doesn't work and you get coached along the way.
Comedy,

1088
01:02:59.131 --> 01:03:03.030
you have to coach yourself.
But in a lot of ways it's similar in that,

1089
01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.370
and I don't mean it in a macho sense,
I'm similar.

1090
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:10.400
It's similar in almost like this objective analogous way where you're looking at

1091
01:03:11.341 --> 01:03:13.740
comedy like a puzzle.

1092
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.040
Whereas martial artists kind of like a puzzle to like when you,

1093
01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:21.560
when you were competing with a person,
even when you're doing just,
uh,
you know,

1094
01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.590
judo or something like that,
we're just trying to throw them to the ground there.

1095
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.680
A puzzle.
How,
what do I have need to do to get this person on their back?

1096
01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:31.560
What do I need to do to get these people to laugh?
What do I need to do?

1097
01:03:31.561 --> 01:03:35.490
Do I need to do I need,
do I need to fucking drink more?

1098
01:03:35.491 --> 01:03:37.380
Do I need to be the guy who always takes his shirt off?

1099
01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:40.140
Do I need to be the guy who was in his underwear?
We're going in the water.

1100
01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.430
Fucking,
I don't care if it's winter,

1101
01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:45.330
we're going to the fucking water parts in the water.
He's said the maniac.

1102
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:48.600
We love him and people love you because of that.

1103
01:03:48.601 --> 01:03:51.380
And then you run with that and then all of a sudden you're on stage and you've

1104
01:03:51.381 --> 01:03:55.680
got 300 people laughing their fucking dicks and tits off and they're going,

1105
01:03:55.681 --> 01:03:59.880
this guy is awesome.
We can't wait to see you again.
And then your parents like,

1106
01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:01.013
hold on.

1107
01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:05.310
So all that shit you were doing where I thought you were a fuckup,

1108
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:07.290
you were actually developing a skill.

1109
01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.500
This skill that Bert Kreischer developed where everybody thought he was fucking

1110
01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:14.900
up was,
everybody loves Bert.
Fuck Raymond.
Everybody loves the bird.

1111
01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:19.860
I Love Ray to Ray Romano is a great guy.
I'm just saying people love you.

1112
01:04:19.861 --> 01:04:22.890
Like if you had,
everybody loves Bert,
even Ray Romano,
we'll probably go,
yeah,

1113
01:04:22.891 --> 01:04:23.910
I guess you could use it.

1114
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:28.170
He wouldn't freak out if you try to do a sitcom called everybody loves Bert.

1115
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:31.590
Everybody does love birds.
It doesn't take away from everybody loves Raymond.

1116
01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:35.760
It should be a goddamn franchise.
Some people love red band.

1117
01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:36.630
That would be the next one.

1118
01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:43.140
Some people think a Douche.

1119
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.000
That's the next one and it would be me be going,
me going,
sorry.

1120
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:51.880
I know I come some time to come off.

1121
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:57.480
That's what you were doing when you were becoming this very social creature.

1122
01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:00.360
I was.
I was a very unsocial person.

1123
01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:03.780
I had to figure out comedy from a different angle,
you know?
And as I,

1124
01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.420
I sorta got better and slowly better.

1125
01:05:06.421 --> 01:05:10.020
And Kalia also relaxed as a person and as I relaxed as a person,

1126
01:05:10.021 --> 01:05:12.660
I got better as a comedian.
As I became a friendlier person,

1127
01:05:12.661 --> 01:05:15.630
I got better as a comedian.
Like all those things played a part in each other.

1128
01:05:15.631 --> 01:05:18.130
Like in the beginning,
I think a lot of what I was doing,

1129
01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:21.490
I was like battling against myself.
I was the opposite of you.

1130
01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:24.910
Instead of being like a very gregarious,

1131
01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:29.170
outgoing and really fun to be around guy,
I was kind of crazy.

1132
01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:34.320
I was dealing with the fact that I had a weird childhood and it was spent a

1133
01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:41.160
large percentage of my young teenage years in terror competing in martial arts

1134
01:05:41.291 --> 01:05:42.670
tournaments always being scared.

1135
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.370
So my approach to it was like I had to develop the other,

1136
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:48.730
I had to learn how to relax.
Like it took me awhile to learn how to relax.

1137
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:51.610
And one of the best ways you learn how to relax is to see other people's

1138
01:05:51.611 --> 01:05:55.270
reaction to you.
You know,
and you bomb or you know,
you just,

1139
01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:58.960
you come off obnoxious and you realize as you're coming off of noxious God,

1140
01:05:58.961 --> 01:06:00.750
I'm of noxious.
Like what is wrong with me?

1141
01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:05.470
It's just the words come out of your mouth,
you know?
And as I've become a father,

1142
01:06:05.471 --> 01:06:09.580
especially as I've gotten older as well,

1143
01:06:09.581 --> 01:06:12.730
but as it become a father because I get to see it from the source.

1144
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:15.610
One of the really unique things about becoming a father,

1145
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:17.470
and I'm sure you would probably agree with this,

1146
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:21.880
is you get to see a child from the source like right out of the box.

1147
01:06:21.881 --> 01:06:25.540
And you get to see them grow and develop.
And it is so fascinating.

1148
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:27.520
Like when my daughter makes me laugh,

1149
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:32.020
there's a weirdness to that laughter that I can't describe.
You know,
like my,
uh,

1150
01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:35.260
my six year old's really funny and she gives me a hard time.

1151
01:06:35.261 --> 01:06:37.690
Like she's always mocking me and making fun of me,

1152
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:42.730
constantly mocking me constantly.
And it's so funny.

1153
01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:46.150
It's hilarious.
It's,
it's really like,

1154
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:50.410
she like has this like almost like painful grin on her face.

1155
01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:54.700
Like she loves fucking with me and she loves it also because I can't stop

1156
01:06:54.701 --> 01:06:58.300
laughing when she does it because this is weird thing is this little human that

1157
01:06:58.301 --> 01:07:03.280
I've watched learn how to talk and then start fucking with me and figure you out

1158
01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:07.030
short,
tiny quick.
But I also tell her what I do wrong.

1159
01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:10.870
I tell her where I screw up and I tell one of the things that I do with my kids.

1160
01:07:10.871 --> 01:07:13.630
It's a,
it's a big one,
man.
I think everybody should do it.

1161
01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:16.360
Whenever I correct my kid about anything,

1162
01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:19.570
if she doesn't tell the truth about something or if she gets upset about

1163
01:07:19.571 --> 01:07:22.270
something,
I say,
honey,
I did the exact same thing.

1164
01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:23.710
I was way worse than you though.

1165
01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:26.890
I was way worse than you and I always tell them I was not as smart as you.

1166
01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:29.620
You're smarter than me and I explain.
I go,

1167
01:07:29.621 --> 01:07:31.000
this is where you're going to learn along the way.

1168
01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:33.730
So you're already give them a victory.
Like,
okay,

1169
01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:38.650
dad was worse than me and I'm smarter than Dad.
Okay,
keep talking.
What else?

1170
01:07:38.651 --> 01:07:42.250
Listening in,
I also,
I keep drilling in their head.

1171
01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.720
This is a big one that I drilled in their head.

1172
01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:47.710
The only difference she knew in me is that I've been alive longer.

1173
01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.680
I'm not better than you.
Okay?
I'm not better than you.

1174
01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.350
I'm just a person who's lived more years,

1175
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:57.850
but I can shave years off of your learning process if you just listen to me

1176
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.560
cause I'll never lie to you.
I'm like,

1177
01:07:59.561 --> 01:08:01.750
if I'm telling you something except for Santa Claus,

1178
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.900
if I'm telling you something got a big issue,
I've got a whole bit about it.

1179
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:06.790
I've got a whole bit about it.
The wife doesn't know about,

1180
01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:09.600
well you know you're not lying to these little fucking kids.
She was in,

1181
01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:11.740
we were in the car the other day.
She was asking about the tooth fair.

1182
01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:13.570
She doesn't believe in the tooth fairy.
She's like,

1183
01:08:13.571 --> 01:08:16.280
that seems like bullshit that's trickled down.
Loss

1184
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.210
<v 1>of faith economics.
But the problem is the four year old man,</v>

1185
01:08:20.211 --> 01:08:23.270
the four year old believes in everything and she's going to miss out on a couple

1186
01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:26.120
of years of being lied to.
Oh my 10 year old's still believe

1187
01:08:26.230 --> 01:08:27.063
<v 5>no,</v>

1188
01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:31.170
<v 1>10 years old.
He needed to bring their kid to a doctor.
Dude,</v>

1189
01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.910
I was taking shit to the next level.
My uncle Pete,
I wasco.
Nope.
My uncle Pete,

1190
01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:40.200
I saved in my phone as Santa Claus.
That's fuck outta here.

1191
01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:45.060
Joe Santa Claus calling you Joe Joe.
No,
I get no,
I'm taking,
I like,

1192
01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:49.740
I look,
hang on.
Take a look at this.
I saved,
let's type in Santa.

1193
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:54.840
I saved his fucking picture.
So when he calls me,
Oh my God,

1194
01:08:54.841 --> 01:08:59.100
the phone rings and you see Sanas face and it's uncle Pete and he's got a few

1195
01:08:59.101 --> 01:09:02.910
Budweisers in him at midnight on Christmas Eve and he just like,

1196
01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:04.620
oh yeah.

1197
01:09:04.621 --> 01:09:07.860
The problem is that's trickled down economics when you tell your kid to make

1198
01:09:07.861 --> 01:09:12.540
sure her boyfriend wears a condom.
Okay.
She's going to of years from now.
Okay,

1199
01:09:12.541 --> 01:09:13.111
honey,
look,

1200
01:09:13.111 --> 01:09:15.900
I know Mike is your boyfriend and now you love each other and you gonna to be

1201
01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:17.820
together forever.
Wherever I'm going,
I'm okay.

1202
01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:22.350
Do you know make them wear a condom?
Make more con for Daddy.
Make a mark condom.

1203
01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.100
No,
dude wants to wear a condom.
I wore a condom at least five times in my life.

1204
01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.930
Really?
Five times,
maybe 10.
I've got a handful on me.

1205
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:36.360
What are you trying to say?
Let's shut this podcast down.

1206
01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.590
<v 5>[inaudible] hard.</v>

1207
01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:48.200
Don't put me in the song and make me fuck my way out.

1208
01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:54.350
<v 1>Never those fight companions.
I don't even need to see anything.
It's right there.</v>

1209
01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:57.890
This is how good the Internet is.
Bam.
He says that,

1210
01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.660
and it's right there at my computer is one.

1211
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:02.840
It's the hardest I've ever laughed people because I thought the flight,

1212
01:10:02.841 --> 01:10:03.920
if I companion,
I was like,

1213
01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:08.480
I'm probably not going to get as into it as I do the podcast because I've lost

1214
01:10:08.481 --> 01:10:11.880
it on the podcast.
I can't listen to it in bed anymore.
You're going to sleep.

1215
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:13.890
So I was like,
I'll put in the fight companion.
I don't know.
It did.

1216
01:10:13.891 --> 01:10:15.890
It must have been like three weeks ago.
Oh,

1217
01:10:15.891 --> 01:10:18.950
you mean the one where I talked to him about his fight?
No,
no,
no,
no.

1218
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:22.510
What the fuck my way that was actually,
you were a little bit more than that.

1219
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:27.020
You were so loose with Eddie and him and it was such a fucking fun atmosphere

1220
01:10:27.021 --> 01:10:31.520
that I sat up in bed and I was like,
fuck it.
That was the Ian Edwards or um,
uh,

1221
01:10:31.521 --> 01:10:36.410
Ian McCaw as well was here,
right?
Yeah.
Was He,
it was small brain.

1222
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.030
I know it was Eddie,
you and Brendan.

1223
01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.460
Cause Fuck my way out of a sauna was my funniest thing.

1224
01:10:40.461 --> 01:10:43.160
I've heard it like I wrote it down on my head and I was like,

1225
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:44.203
I got to bring that up.

1226
01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.720
It was about a guy w Eddie and I used to work at a 24 hour fitness and there was

1227
01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:50.870
a guy who was a manager there that was a really friendly guy that was also

1228
01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.290
before he was manager there in the West hills location.

1229
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:58.640
He was a manager of the one in West Hollywood and the West Hollywood one was

1230
01:10:58.641 --> 01:11:02.540
just basically like a pit stop for dudes.
Just get to dex drain.

1231
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:07.760
I worked out at West Hollywood crunch.
That was a fucking meat law.

1232
01:11:07.761 --> 01:11:11.180
That's a crazy spot.
Twos.
We'd just be sitting there shaving their balls.

1233
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:14.070
I worked

1234
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.690
<v 6>out in,
I had a whole bit,
I did never made it onto a DVD or a CD or anything.</v>

1235
01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:23.691
It was a whole bit about working out at Gold's gym on Cole Street in West

1236
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.470
Hollywood because news radio was in this one area and Gold's gym was right down

1237
01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:30.810
the street.
I was like,
oh,
that's convenient.
I'll just work out there.

1238
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.330
I worked out there twice.
I spent,
I've spent whatever.
It was like,

1239
01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:38.700
I think you had to get like three months.
I was like,
yeah,
I don't,

1240
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:42.180
I'm not comfortable man,
and then I understood what it's like to be a woman.

1241
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:44.820
I really did.
I understand what it's like to be a woman.

1242
01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:48.960
She's a woman with a skirt on and an office full of fucking savages just walking

1243
01:11:48.961 --> 01:11:52.570
past that water cooler while they're all quiet holding onto the little paper
cup.

1244
01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:56.300
Just the problem is I like it like you,

1245
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:59.640
like what were the women did antelope or you're like being the dude.

1246
01:11:59.641 --> 01:12:02.130
Know that by the water cooler.
Being a sexual harasser,

1247
01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.250
I never had a problem with dudes like hitting on me.
I was always like,

1248
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.430
that's what,
that's what,
that's what I got it.
Guess what?
That's a new meme.

1249
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:12.480
I never had a problem with dudes hitting on me cause I was like guess what?

1250
01:12:12.481 --> 01:12:13.900
Guess what?
I got it.

1251
01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:23.640
Somebody's going to try to fuck you now just to make a point.

1252
01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:28.850
I can't get the visual of guys who hate owls out of my head and that was the

1253
01:12:29.371 --> 01:12:32.520
fucking greatest analogy and all I can pitch,

1254
01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:35.730
you know there's people that sit outside Gelson's and try to get you to sign

1255
01:12:35.731 --> 01:12:38.220
forms about,
they're like catch you in the like,

1256
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:40.740
hey do you wanna stand up for gays and your like with your kid and you're like I

1257
01:12:40.741 --> 01:12:44.880
do.
But right now I've got groceries and a child and I can't make a political

1258
01:12:44.881 --> 01:12:45.390
statement.

1259
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:49.950
I don't know how much that helps a god put his finger in front of my face and

1260
01:12:49.951 --> 01:12:54.780
said,
do you have two minutes for gay rights?
And then my,
c'mon man,

1261
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:57.030
what do you,
what do you,
what do you mean this is not,

1262
01:12:57.330 --> 01:12:59.520
this is not the way to get people to like you.

1263
01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:03.870
You can't trap them when they're on the way to doing other stuff and like make

1264
01:13:03.871 --> 01:13:08.550
them sign pieces of paper the way we get.
Yeah.
This is the way we get,
you know,

1265
01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:13.470
signatures for our petition,
you know,
another way,
make a website.
Okay,

1266
01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.800
get,
you'll get more than just standing in front of a fucking doorway.

1267
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:21.930
What are the numbers like as far as like annoying people for knowing people

1268
01:13:21.931 --> 01:13:25.470
slash you know,
get,
get people to sign your petition.

1269
01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.300
You're going to annoy way more people.

1270
01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:31.500
If you get people to do it on a website through social media,
you don't tweet me,

1271
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:34.950
I'll retweet it.
I'll retweet it.
Only hit at 1.4 million people.

1272
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:37.530
That's way better than annoying me when I'm coming.

1273
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:41.730
Obviously I'm an unusual case,
but most people,

1274
01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:43.980
what are the numbers of people that come out of whole foods?

1275
01:13:43.981 --> 01:13:45.450
Is it a hundred and hour?

1276
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:49.890
Is it even a hundred the attrition factor of like you're just bothering people

1277
01:13:49.891 --> 01:13:54.060
and put flipping on the other side of it as opposed to it really fucking
helping.

1278
01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:56.820
I know a dude who won't go to a fucking super,

1279
01:13:56.821 --> 01:14:00.300
he'll pull a new supermarket and if he sees there's people that have like the

1280
01:14:00.301 --> 01:14:03.630
stand there and the the open bin for homeless people,

1281
01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:08.720
like what's up with that open fucking plastic thing with like this really easy

1282
01:14:08.821 --> 01:14:12.010
to unscrew tie.
You can just reach in and take that.
How do I know what the

1283
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.240
<v 3>fuck this is?
Money's going.</v>

1284
01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:16.770
You have a laminated sign that says it's going to homeless people.

1285
01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:21.340
Those people are actually are fake.
Like I ignore them.
I don't even talk to them.

1286
01:14:21.341 --> 01:14:23.080
If they say something,
act like they don't exist.

1287
01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:25.630
Well I tried to be charitable except when forced,

1288
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.100
whenever I'm forced or were cornered to be charitable.
I'm not charitable.

1289
01:14:30.101 --> 01:14:32.530
I'm very charitable.
If if it's much choice,

1290
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.760
I like to give money but I don't like to be asked to give money I think.

1291
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:40.570
I think that's obnoxious.
I think making someone aware of your,

1292
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.420
your charity is cool,
but you got to leave it at that.

1293
01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:45.700
Like getting in front of someone,
putting a finger.

1294
01:14:45.701 --> 01:14:49.960
Do you have three minutes for gay rights?
Like,
that's on how it works,
man.

1295
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:53.200
This is what I have for gay rights.
All the love in the world.
Okay,

1296
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:54.460
I got all the love in the world.
You're not,

1297
01:14:54.461 --> 01:14:57.340
you don't have to worry about me because when it comes time to voting and it

1298
01:14:57.341 --> 01:15:01.030
comes time to talking about it,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm not your enemy at all.

1299
01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.310
I'm 100% for you,
so don't worry about me.

1300
01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:07.940
<v 1>You and Todd glass with the reason I don't say the f word.
I used to say faggot.</v>

1301
01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:10.390
I loved it.
I know.
But you had talked about,
you know,

1302
01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:15.370
they've kind of taken it from us.
No,
no,
no.
Can I tell you what I believe Dave,

1303
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:19.670
Dave,
what they've done is they've let it age like a fine wine.

1304
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:23.390
So now when you do hear it,
it comes out like a bomb,
like a bomb.

1305
01:15:23.391 --> 01:15:26.450
And it's even 10 times funnier than it ever was when we were kids.
Well,

1306
01:15:26.451 --> 01:15:30.830
amongst friends,
if Brian,
if you were,
if you said something and Brian just goes,

1307
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:35.540
shut up,
faggot starts would start crying if you just nailed it.

1308
01:15:35.541 --> 01:15:38.070
If you just had that one moment like a Mary Lou,
right?
Yeah.

1309
01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:41.930
Well you were talking about how you're scared to get your feet wet or something

1310
01:15:41.931 --> 01:15:44.870
like that if he says stuff like that.

1311
01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:50.990
But if there was a Gig,
but if Justin Martin Dale was sitting right beside you,

1312
01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.900
if Justin Martin Dale,
who we love dearly,

1313
01:15:53.901 --> 01:15:58.100
it was sitting right beside you and be like,
oh fuck.
Um,

1314
01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.451
I gotta say this.

1315
01:15:59.451 --> 01:16:01.310
I got to say this because I'm never going to fucking remember this.

1316
01:16:01.311 --> 01:16:02.930
And the whole time you were saying this house,
I felt bad.

1317
01:16:03.170 --> 01:16:07.190
There was one guy at the Gelson's on Riverside and Little Canyon for gay rights.

1318
01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.850
And as I walked out and he went boom machine and I went,
hey,
and he goes,
Yo,

1319
01:16:10.851 --> 01:16:13.430
gay rights.
And I was just went,
Nah.
And he was like,
oh,
got it.

1320
01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:14.750
And just walked off bat.

1321
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:18.530
I can give you 20 bucks you need to stop talking to immediately.
Amen.

1322
01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.300
Can I just give you 20 bucks and we end this talk

1323
01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:23.400
<v 3>to you about the weather?
Just don't ask me.
I just,</v>

1324
01:16:23.401 --> 01:16:26.460
I find it obnoxious when I don't,
and it's like anything,

1325
01:16:26.461 --> 01:16:30.420
I can't out flyers for a show to people that are coming out of the bathroom.
No,

1326
01:16:30.421 --> 01:16:33.750
you don't do that.
They don't,
that's not what they're looking for.
You know?

1327
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:38.520
I believe that you can,
you can get results from annoying people,

1328
01:16:38.850 --> 01:16:42.450
but you're also going to annoy people and whenever you can not annoy people,

1329
01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.730
that's the way to go.
Like if there's a way to do it.

1330
01:16:45.090 --> 01:16:47.490
Like I always feel like I don't,

1331
01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:53.160
I don't like advertising shit.
Like I don't like advertising sponsors.

1332
01:16:53.161 --> 01:16:54.990
I don't like advertising shows.

1333
01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:59.220
But the only way to let people know about those shows is to advertise them.

1334
01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.073
It's the only way,

1335
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:05.270
but there's like a fine line between too much and too little and not enough.

1336
01:17:05.851 --> 01:17:07.680
And what's your intention?
Why you're going into it?

1337
01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:10.370
And I always feel like if someone's on my Twitter,
you know,

1338
01:17:10.371 --> 01:17:12.700
I'm going to talk about shows,
you know,
I'm going to talk about UFC.

1339
01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.160
UFC is coming up,
I'm going to let you know.
I mean,

1340
01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:18.020
but it's also because I'm fucking actually legitimately excited about it.

1341
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.530
You know,
if I'm doing a show in New Year's Eve,
I'm excited about that show.

1342
01:17:21.531 --> 01:17:23.840
If I'm going to a UFC and I'm telling you,
Whoa Shit,

1343
01:17:23.841 --> 01:17:27.400
Jon Jones is fighting Daniel Cormier.
Me,
I'm not,
um,
uh,
yeah,

1344
01:17:27.401 --> 01:17:29.390
my letting you know you should order an on paper view,

1345
01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.760
but I'm not trying to do it for like job security.

1346
01:17:31.761 --> 01:17:34.970
I'm trying to do it because I fucking love it and I want everybody know about
it.

1347
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:37.820
Yeah.
So as long as my heart is pure,

1348
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:40.700
I'm willing to go forward with these ideas.

1349
01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:41.810
<v 2>Speaking of boys in New Year's Eve,</v>

1350
01:17:41.811 --> 01:17:46.230
I'll be at the Irvine improv where you Holla the Improv on Hollywood,

1351
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:49.920
<v 3>Melrose in Hollywood.
Yeah.
With Ian Edwards and Tony Hinchcliffe.</v>

1352
01:17:49.921 --> 01:17:53.250
Jesus fucking Christ.
In other words,
it's true.
It's funny,
motherfucker.

1353
01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:56.820
Ian Edwards is the most underrated comedian in America today.

1354
01:17:56.850 --> 01:17:59.850
I'm telling you folks,
if you have a chance to see this guy,

1355
01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:04.260
I just don't say it enough.
There are some great,
great,
great comedians out there.

1356
01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:08.970
Ian Edwards is up there with all of them.
He's up there with bill burr.

1357
01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:10.920
He's up there with Dave Chappelle.

1358
01:18:10.921 --> 01:18:14.770
He's up there with Louis C K who's a mix up there with Brian Redman.

1359
01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:19.710
He's up there with Bert Kreischer,
Thompson Guerra.
He's fucking fantastic.

1360
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:21.510
Good as Joey is.

1361
01:18:21.511 --> 01:18:24.000
I don't like saying that cause Joey makes me laugh harder than anybody that's

1362
01:18:24.001 --> 01:18:26.970
ever lived.
Ian Edwards is a motherfucker,
dude.
I,

1363
01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:31.710
I worked with him in Philly and DC and it was a pleasure.
It was a pleasure.

1364
01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:33.210
I was like,
how do more,

1365
01:18:33.630 --> 01:18:36.840
he's like one of those dudes where you feel like God damn people who need to

1366
01:18:36.841 --> 01:18:41.610
know about him because he's so good.
He's so good.

1367
01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:47.090
And he's got this rhythm where he Bailey's putting out any energy and she's

1368
01:18:47.091 --> 01:18:49.890
just,
people were falling down crying.

1369
01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:53.190
<v 2>It sounds like it's a forced rhythm.
Like not,
not say that Mitch Hedberg was,</v>

1370
01:18:53.191 --> 01:18:56.770
but it's,
it's so genuine way that he talks when he was talking about,

1371
01:18:56.910 --> 01:19:00.240
I think he was on the show when he's talking about he was gonna move out.

1372
01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:02.250
He had to move out of his house,
put stuff into a,

1373
01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:06.270
into a storage unit and then the place didn't go into escrow and,

1374
01:19:06.710 --> 01:19:11.580
and but the way he talked about tragedy was the same way he did comedy.
He goes,

1375
01:19:11.581 --> 01:19:14.040
I've got money,
but I'm not going to do it cause it's not going to sound right.

1376
01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:16.740
But I thought to myself,
and he used to work at the Boston Comedy Club.

1377
01:19:16.741 --> 01:19:18.900
He was one of the regulars there when I worked the door.

1378
01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.970
And you just sit in the back with a long ass dreadlocks.

1379
01:19:20.971 --> 01:19:24.030
I wrote a joke about him because his hair was falling out,
but he didn't,

1380
01:19:24.031 --> 01:19:28.050
I didn't even know I wrote it,
but I said,
when you're a have dreadlocks in,

1381
01:19:28.051 --> 01:19:28.560
your hair's falling out.

1382
01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.090
Do you just lose just one dreadlock at the time you wake up with a snake in your

1383
01:19:33.091 --> 01:19:35.840
pillow and yet
he didn't know he,

1384
01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:39.930
it's like hanging rope that's been halfway severed in an action movie.

1385
01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:44.820
When you see those strands breaking,
this spiraling,
I just bumped this camera.

1386
01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:48.180
Don't worry about it.
But yeah,
in Edwards is fucking,

1387
01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:53.250
he's amazing dude too,
man.
He's a really,
really,
really good dude.
Can I tell,

1388
01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:56.790
can I tell you what,
if I could talk to him,
what I'd want to talk about.

1389
01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:59.400
There was a sex,
there was a time,
no,

1390
01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:03.750
there was a time that everyone in New York talked about like Patrice,

1391
01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:08.460
everyone that we're Hemi Chappelle went to Edinborough together and apparently

1392
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:11.160
<v 1>they day they had this epic.</v>

1393
01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.820
I mean it could have been just one of those folklore things that one joke turns

1394
01:20:14.821 --> 01:20:18.090
into 10 turns into 20 turns into make believe.
But man,

1395
01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:22.560
apparently they're like Hemi Chappelle and Jason Steinburge and Barry Katz all

1396
01:20:22.561 --> 01:20:23.760
went to Edinborough together,

1397
01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:28.230
like back in like fucking 92 or 95 I would love to,

1398
01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.300
if anyone ever gets the most podcasts,

1399
01:20:30.301 --> 01:20:33.300
bring them up because I'm dying to hear the stories.
And what happened?

1400
01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.380
I don't know.
There was this story about same.

1401
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:40.180
I'll let him tell it.
Brave heart stopped.

1402
01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:44.490
It was written on animal skins on a snowy marsh.

1403
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:47.570
<v 5>Ah,
someone with a feather</v>

1404
01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.960
<v 1>dipped it into ink that was made from coal.</v>

1405
01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.520
I scroll these words,

1406
01:20:55.170 --> 01:20:56.910
Ian Edwards and Dave Chappelle.

1407
01:20:56.911 --> 01:20:59.010
I don't know what happened was some shit went down or something.

1408
01:20:59.011 --> 01:21:02.490
Maybe Barry Katz was involved.
It's very shady.
Apparently.
It was hilarious.

1409
01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:05.940
It was like two dudes who are different people and they were just like,

1410
01:21:05.941 --> 01:21:09.120
it was like the odd couple.
I don't know.
Ian Edwards in Dave Chappelle.

1411
01:21:09.121 --> 01:21:11.450
There are the odd couple of very different people I guess.
Well,

1412
01:21:11.451 --> 01:21:14.880
Ian is a v He's a Vegan.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's very healthy.

1413
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:18.810
I couldn't do healthy clearly.
Yup.
Whiskey.

1414
01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:21.330
Are we done with it or we know speaking in front of your bitch.

1415
01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:25.860
Maker's mark ice in the metal thing.
That looks like a

1416
01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:30.990
tongs.
That's for gentlemen,
sir.
This is a gentleman's podcast.

1417
01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:32.970
We are in fact on iTunes.

1418
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:35.400
I don't know if you know this with your dainty gold watch.

1419
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.720
What's up with that watch?

1420
01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.530
Did you win that shit with one of those school cranes at the fucking carnival?

1421
01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.660
I almost didn't wear it today because I was like,

1422
01:21:42.661 --> 01:21:45.120
Joe fucking notice as fucking what's this strange watch?

1423
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:49.890
It's also has you have a club wristband on seventies no,
it's a,

1424
01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:53.550
it's from the hospital.
Hospitals can't tell you something.

1425
01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:58.110
I was scared to sh AH,
fuck it.
I'm like,
if you're scared of what?
Nothing.

1426
01:21:58.170 --> 01:22:00.000
Nothing to show somebody why that myself.

1427
01:22:00.001 --> 01:22:03.990
Sometimes what happens around you is I get so fucking open that I do that bad.

1428
01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:06.780
I get scared.
You get scared because he get it open.

1429
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:09.690
You have one drink and you're hammered.

1430
01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:12.080
You drink that whole bottle of champagne first.
Yeah.

1431
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:17.350
<v 5>Oh,
I didn't see that
before.</v>

1432
01:22:17.351 --> 01:22:21.100
He got to celebrated way.
That's how you know someone's an alcoholic.
Not a word.

1433
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:24.140
Not a word of what anybody likes.
Some champagne.

1434
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:31.420
Open up a bottle of champagne.
He didn't offer any day anyone.

1435
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:36.220
No one has had any of the champagne bar open.
That tit twisted a thing.

1436
01:22:36.221 --> 01:22:37.820
Pop the cork.
Oh,
so

1437
01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:46.330
first grade,
you don't know that we have a lot of liquor here.

1438
01:22:46.331 --> 01:22:47.560
You don't need to bring your own.

1439
01:22:47.770 --> 01:22:50.770
[inaudible] was so panicked and he was going to do this show sober.

1440
01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:55.240
He popped the cork and didn't tell anyone.
You didn't bring it up.

1441
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:57.670
He didn't even talking,
but it's like you shot up in front of us.

1442
01:22:57.671 --> 01:23:01.270
You like fucking tied off with a rubber band.
Put it in your teeth,

1443
01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:04.640
you just fucking bang.
And we're just like

1444
01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.400
<v 1>trying to pretend that it's not even happening.
I'm coming in hot.</v>

1445
01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:12.550
I told you that.
That's not hot.
You came and got to open it.

1446
01:23:12.551 --> 01:23:15.250
You got to fucking Cork in front of you.
This is coming in rude

1447
01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:20.950
and selfish.
You'd come in in rude

1448
01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:27.340
dude.
I got to tell you,
I watched one of your videos of your,
um,

1449
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:30.580
your podcast and I'm jealous of your man cave.
You know what?
I'm jealous.

1450
01:23:30.581 --> 01:23:34.780
I'm ready for this.
The wood on your walls.
What's that?
It's a,

1451
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:40.960
it's a reclaimed lumber from,

1452
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:45.610
I think 150 year old barn in Indiana.
Uh,
Noah,

1453
01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:47.290
you fuck it smells so good.

1454
01:23:47.291 --> 01:23:50.410
You walk into that man came in and smells like history.
I bet it does.

1455
01:23:50.411 --> 01:23:55.330
So it's son of a bitch.
I love old wood dude.

1456
01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:58.960
This fucking shit right here.
This is a hundred year old wood from a farmhouse.

1457
01:23:59.170 --> 01:24:02.380
I went way out of my way to get this would like reclaimed lumber.

1458
01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.770
I just had this idea that if I got old wood,

1459
01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:08.590
it would make me feel different when I was holding onto it and when I was

1460
01:24:08.591 --> 01:24:13.450
touching it,
it might be total horseshit.
But this wood right here,
that's what,

1461
01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:17.490
that's the man cave.
Let me see your band came to Joe.
See this,

1462
01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:21.910
know the difference between you and me.
What I make my own antlers.
Motherfucker.

1463
01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:24.850
Just see this.
See this map right here.

1464
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:30.640
It goes up and there's an LCD screen behind it.
So it's like a secret TV.

1465
01:24:30.850 --> 01:24:33.190
Does Moose,
Bert Kreischer oh fuck.

1466
01:24:33.970 --> 01:24:35.660
What are you doing after you get out of here and he wants a moose?

1467
01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:38.960
<v 2>I would absolutely loves him.
Um,
my uncle,</v>

1468
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:43.040
like right before the rolling stone magazine came out,
like it was spring break.

1469
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:46.790
It came out April 1st and I had spring break and my uncle,

1470
01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.140
I didn't know what I was gonna do with my life.

1471
01:24:48.141 --> 01:24:50.270
My uncle sent me up to his house in DC.

1472
01:24:50.271 --> 01:24:54.050
He wasn't there to interview for jobs that,
uh,
publicity firms,

1473
01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:58.850
PR public relations.
And he said he left a note and he said,

1474
01:24:58.851 --> 01:25:02.210
when you get to my house,
my uncle is fairly wealthy.
When you get to my house,

1475
01:25:02.211 --> 01:25:04.970
go down to the wine cellar,
uh,
have dinner.

1476
01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.550
Sit at that table and write out your goals.
We didn't minute that

1477
01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:12.580
<v 1>table.
He's making you have dinner on your own.
My uncle's a,
yeah,
no,</v>

1478
01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:16.040
those are very different guy.
Does he have a cook that cooks you?
This dinner?

1479
01:25:16.041 --> 01:25:18.210
The chef.
And he's got,
he's very wealthy dude.

1480
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:21.600
So he tells you to sit down and they serve you dinner and he tells you to write

1481
01:25:21.601 --> 01:25:23.790
out your goals.
Two bottles,
one,
two bottles of red wine.

1482
01:25:23.791 --> 01:25:28.350
And my dad and this room is in the wine soap uncle.
It's in a wine cellar.

1483
01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:32.880
You need to become that uncle.
And then he tells me my nephews too young.
Sorry.

1484
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:37.910
That table is from one of the fucking knights of the round table from one of the

1485
01:25:38.370 --> 01:25:42.930
under tables from the hobbit.
The boats that land here first.
Roanoke,

1486
01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:47.130
Penta.
But it's at all fucking wood table.
It's only this,

1487
01:25:47.131 --> 01:25:50.970
it looks Roanoke.
Virginia.
Yeah.
One of the old boats came over.

1488
01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:54.600
Hold the captain's table.
A captain's table.
Holy Shit.
It's,

1489
01:25:54.610 --> 01:25:58.770
it's literally from like a 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue.

1490
01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.940
That kind of shit.
No,
no,
no.
Probably 17 or 1800 that's when they,

1491
01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.370
somebody has a 1492

1492
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:06.520
<v 3>he should get that there.
I don't think that's around anymore.</v>

1493
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:10.610
Come up with that cash,
but it was pulled out of that paper one bro.

1494
01:26:10.611 --> 01:26:14.470
You can't get number three.
I'm one of the top three billionaires.

1495
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:15.620
Shut up bitch.

1496
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:21.420
<v 2>Yeah.
Those old wood and old wood I think evokes it.
You're right.</v>

1497
01:26:21.570 --> 01:26:25.050
I was trying to agree with you and I'm way too fucked up to explain my theory

1498
01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.660
and I just ended up trying to brag about some dinner I had.

1499
01:26:27.710 --> 01:26:32.510
<v 3>This is my idea.
Shit.
No,
it's a good dude.
That's a fascinating story.</v>

1500
01:26:32.511 --> 01:26:37.250
You're fucking uncle told you to sit down in a 300 year old table and he was

1501
01:26:37.251 --> 01:26:39.660
going to bring his slaves to,

1502
01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:42.620
to have a meal prepared for you,

1503
01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:46.230
asked you to drink two bottles of wine probably,
you know,

1504
01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:49.790
made by people were put to death after it was over so they didn't know the

1505
01:26:49.791 --> 01:26:50.624
recipe.

1506
01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:54.590
This is fucking secret grape stomping procedure and then you're supposed to

1507
01:26:54.591 --> 01:26:58.490
scroll down your goals.
Just doing that,
just doing that.

1508
01:26:58.491 --> 01:27:02.540
Just offering that environment where you could sit at this table and someone

1509
01:27:02.541 --> 01:27:07.100
would come over dressed like fucking ask Jeeves with like little tail feathers

1510
01:27:07.101 --> 01:27:09.800
behind him.
Mr Crusher,

1511
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:12.740
would you like whole Shradda fish would,

1512
01:27:12.741 --> 01:27:15.390
you'll filet manual and you're like,
yeah,

1513
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:21.380
and he's bringing over a bottles of wine and he's telling you to write down your

1514
01:27:21.381 --> 01:27:25.010
goals.
Just that alone probably is very intimidating.

1515
01:27:25.011 --> 01:27:28.430
It's probably not good for you at all.
It's probably the opposite of beneficial.

1516
01:27:28.431 --> 01:27:30.710
I'm thinking it probably be really good thing for you,
but I'm probably,

1517
01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:33.710
I'm thinking maybe I'll make you go to burning man and stay there for a couple

1518
01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:37.580
of years just to gather your thoughts.
You need to get one of those old tables.

1519
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:40.600
Oh tape.
I got an old table and they'll get like I want,
let's see.

1520
01:27:40.670 --> 01:27:42.800
Let's play a game.
Who get the oldest fucking table?
Dude,

1521
01:27:42.801 --> 01:27:46.880
I have an old table from five years ago that we started the podcast on that.

1522
01:27:46.881 --> 01:27:50.240
I'm trying to figure out what to do with weight cause Mrs. Reagan wants it out

1523
01:27:50.241 --> 01:27:53.570
of the house.
That round black table that we started the podcast with

1524
01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:58.120
<v 2>with the,
with the stems with the mix.
Yes.
Oh that's a great,</v>

1525
01:27:58.920 --> 01:27:59.170
great

1526
01:27:59.170 --> 01:28:00.850
<v 3>table.
You know what I should do at that table?</v>

1527
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:04.990
I should sell that table and I should take the proceeds and give it to my friend

1528
01:28:04.991 --> 01:28:08.710
Justin wren and helped the pygmies.
Right.
That would make me,

1529
01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.240
because I'm sentimental about shit,

1530
01:28:10.241 --> 01:28:13.300
unless I could figure out a way to make it beneficial because it will sell that

1531
01:28:13.301 --> 01:28:15.190
table.
Will you handle this?
Because I don't have time.

1532
01:28:15.230 --> 01:28:17.960
<v 2>Can I tell you what I,
can I tell you a pain in the ass?</v>

1533
01:28:18.170 --> 01:28:20.150
Can I tell you the way I look in the shit off on Jamie?

1534
01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:24.170
I would just look at it like that table inspired so much creativity.

1535
01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:27.440
I would want it to inspire more creativity as opposed to sell it to auction.

1536
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:28.750
You know what I mean?
I'd want to,

1537
01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:32.090
I want to put it back into the creative universe and go,
let's see where it goes.

1538
01:28:32.091 --> 01:28:34.760
What do I give it to?
A creative dude.
It fucking kills himself.
Okay.

1539
01:28:35.530 --> 01:28:40.450
How about that comedy store?
Yeah.
Right.
Where bring it where?

1540
01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:42.733
Tommy's what office.

1541
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:45.260
<v 3>Oh,
that's good mood.
You know what I should do?</v>

1542
01:28:45.261 --> 01:28:48.370
I should pretend somebody bought it for five grand and just send them back and

1543
01:28:48.371 --> 01:28:49.204
it just didn't.

1544
01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.730
What's the most anyone's getting paid for that stupid fucking table.

1545
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:54.140
It's a $50 table.

1546
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:57.620
<v 2>Nah,
but it's,
it's,
it's probably a hiding or remember it now.</v>

1547
01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:58.700
It's a couple hundred bucks.

1548
01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.040
I can't remember if there was a lazy Susan on with a Lazy Susan

1549
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:05.310
<v 1>on it or sorry,
I think someone gave it to,
I don't even know where it came from.</v>

1550
01:29:05.850 --> 01:29:08.610
I don't know.
Anything would allow that.
I put that back in the creative universe.

1551
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:12.810
I've had some good times on that table I did to shh.
Whoa.

1552
01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:19.040
<v 5>[inaudible] what's up with that stain?</v>

1553
01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.010
You gotta love that Jamie.

1554
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.420
<v 1>Bob,
that's half and half.
Uh,
uh,
yeah,</v>

1555
01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:30.180
it was a great table and fucking motherfucker of a table son.

1556
01:29:32.650 --> 01:29:35.820
I Dunno.
We'll figure out a way.
We'll figure out something to do with it,
but I,

1557
01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.070
but that has five years.
This,

1558
01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:43.370
this table has a hundred years of cows being trapped in a fence.

1559
01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:48.750
It was like this horror in this table.
It doesn't exist in other tables.

1560
01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:53.400
This is a farm table.
I kind of have a farm.

1561
01:29:54.370 --> 01:29:57.990
You do know you do.
And I'm real life.
You do.
I kind of have a farm.
I mean,

1562
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.350
I don't have any,
um,
I don't have any animals that I eat,

1563
01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:04.260
but I have animals that eat their eggs.
Oh.

1564
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:07.380
The animals that I eat are all animals that are wild in a sense.

1565
01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.700
It's like the best farm.

1566
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:12.390
Like right now I want to give you some moose meat and one of the reasons why I

1567
01:30:12.391 --> 01:30:15.360
want to give you some moose meat is I have like 400 fucking pounds of it.

1568
01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:20.760
I really did get obsessed when I hear you,
when you get into your things,

1569
01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.490
there was a period where you,
anyone who talked about psychedelic adventuring,

1570
01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:28.320
I got really into because I felt like I was testing the boundaries of anxiety

1571
01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:32.760
with like fearful activities and I was like,
why am I so scared of psychedelics?

1572
01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.140
Like why am I terrified of it?

1573
01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:36.690
And there was a period where anytime you talk to anyone about psychedelics,

1574
01:30:36.691 --> 01:30:41.340
I get in that now all these hunter dues,
you got the,
I can't,

1575
01:30:41.341 --> 01:30:44.820
I'm so bad at names,
but the guy that you talked to,

1576
01:30:44.821 --> 01:30:48.740
three dudes Rinella than the one dude who,
I mean Warren.
And then the other guy,

1577
01:30:49.150 --> 01:30:53.010
Cameron Hanes,
ignore Cameron Hanes,
that guy.
There's one guy that says,
I know,

1578
01:30:53.011 --> 01:30:55.680
what's his name again?
He kept doing the job.
Oh No,
that's timber net.

1579
01:30:55.681 --> 01:30:58.410
He's just being silly.
Yeah,
I know.
But like that's who the threes are.
Good.

1580
01:30:58.411 --> 01:30:59.490
Do too.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1581
01:30:59.550 --> 01:31:04.470
But I got really into this fucking hunting thing and I was like,

1582
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:07.680
do you want to go hunting?
I'd love to.
Okay,
let's do it.
I'd love to,

1583
01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:10.050
most likely I'm going to do a TV show.

1584
01:31:10.051 --> 01:31:13.020
We're working on that right now with Steve Ellis company.

1585
01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:14.850
Or I take first-timers hunting.

1586
01:31:16.170 --> 01:31:19.500
<v 5>No booze.
Oh,
he's just getting some licensed coffee.</v>

1587
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:22.420
Why have some coffee without some makers?

1588
01:31:22.421 --> 01:31:26.620
Just a little bit of the Little Dash Dash.
Come on.

1589
01:31:26.621 --> 01:31:28.440
It's the fucking fifth anniversary kid.

1590
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:31.670
<v 1>Brian,
what's the matter?
Are you scared?
Now?
I just have a lot of shows tonight.</v>

1591
01:31:33.670 --> 01:31:37.910
How many shows?
You got?
Three shows.
Tell me about these shows.
Irvine Improv.

1592
01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:41.000
Then this other show that's near the earth.

1593
01:31:41.001 --> 01:31:43.320
I don't know where it's called though.
And then uh,

1594
01:31:47.170 --> 01:31:47.570
<v 5>no,
no,
no.</v>

1595
01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:50.090
Don't give him that because he's not gonna be able to drink that on the way
home.

1596
01:31:50.091 --> 01:31:52.400
Get them an actual glass like a gentleman.
Oh,

1597
01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:57.520
we've got another glass while she's no gentleman like a little gentleman.

1598
01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:00.610
Listen,
this is in peer pressure.
This is celebration,

1599
01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:05.780
<v 6>dude,
dude,
dude,
dude,
dude,
dude.
Just got lazy.</v>

1600
01:32:05.790 --> 01:32:10.630
Burble trying to get him arrested.
That doesn't help.

1601
01:32:10.631 --> 01:32:13.000
It's the same amount of alcohol.
You're like a child.

1602
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.400
You look at cat that hides under the fucking couch,

1603
01:32:15.401 --> 01:32:19.630
but you Taylor's poking out because little something,
little something.

1604
01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.860
Salute my brother.
Happy five years.

1605
01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:28.600
Hey Bert.
Kreischer powerful Bert Kreischer in the house.

1606
01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.900
So buys book or or bit torn it,

1607
01:32:32.290 --> 01:32:36.070
but when you can afford then by that's,
that's the future,
right?
Joy,

1608
01:32:36.071 --> 01:32:38.950
whatever the fuck I put out,
that's the,
that's the future.
This is enough people,

1609
01:32:38.951 --> 01:32:42.130
folks.
You know,
things cost five bucks.
There's enough people,
you know,

1610
01:32:42.131 --> 01:32:43.060
people keep asking me,

1611
01:32:43.061 --> 01:32:47.170
how do you feel about your shows are fucking being bid torrented it's okay.

1612
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:50.410
It really is okay.
If that's the only way you can get it,
get it.

1613
01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:51.670
And here's the other thing.

1614
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:54.940
If you get it through bitcoin torrent and you don't like it,
I'm happy.

1615
01:32:54.941 --> 01:32:55.774
Didn't pay for it.

1616
01:32:56.020 --> 01:33:00.190
I'm way happier that somebody gets something for free and doesn't like it,

1617
01:33:00.191 --> 01:33:03.730
then pays for something and likes it.
That sounds like I'm bullshitting you,

1618
01:33:03.731 --> 01:33:05.220
but I'm telling you the truth.
The,

1619
01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:10.560
if you can slide through life with the least amount of conflicts possible.

1620
01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:13.180
That's why you shouldn't,
but fuck without lube.

1621
01:33:15.370 --> 01:33:18.520
Why be rude?
Why be rude?
Okay.

1622
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:23.950
What is it so hard to get?
Lube is,
it's not like fucking ANAB man.

1623
01:33:23.951 --> 01:33:26.470
Tanium like some shit from Avatar.

1624
01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:30.820
UNOBTAINIUM it's not the shit wolverines bones are made out of.
Okay?

1625
01:33:30.821 --> 01:33:35.290
You can get it everywhere.
Every fucking way you look,
if you have a phone,
okay,

1626
01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:39.340
well you,
what you need to do is you needed a Yelp pharmacy.
Okay?

1627
01:33:39.341 --> 01:33:43.570
Look for pharmacy.
24 hours.
Look at that cvs point 10 miles.

1628
01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:47.140
Go take a left on van.
Owen Day are cvs.
Get you loop,

1629
01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:50.170
but fuck someone with sweat.

1630
01:33:52.630 --> 01:33:53.463
<v 0>Yes.</v>

1631
01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:07.180
<v 6>When you look back and you see Elvis with his stupid sunglasses on,
he,
he's like,</v>

1632
01:34:07.181 --> 01:34:08.014
oh,
I agree

1633
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:14.570
it's a six to eight but on sweat.
Look at Jimmy Hill,

1634
01:34:14.571 --> 01:34:18.560
man.
Ever since then I've been taking a pill to try to recover.
Go down the line.

1635
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:22.970
What would
rosa parks,
I tell you what's better about this table?

1636
01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:26.170
Three people on the wall behind me,
only one of them never bought foxhole.

1637
01:34:27.190 --> 01:34:30.740
Guarantee a Rosa parks.
It was never involved in that activity.

1638
01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:35.170
That's my shirt too.
Just so
you know.

1639
01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:37.100
It's really crazy how few people know.

1640
01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:40.580
Two one on Jamie to Ma and I'm on Rosa parks.

1641
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:45.200
Very few people know what Rosa parks it looks like when I do this podcast,

1642
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:49.880
people come to the studio.
I have a three mugshots behind me.

1643
01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:53.030
One of them is from Jimmy Hendrickson Toronto.

1644
01:34:53.210 --> 01:34:55.340
He got busted with heroin and something else.

1645
01:34:55.610 --> 01:35:00.470
One of them is the infamous Rosa parks arrest where she got arrested because she

1646
01:35:00.471 --> 01:35:02.870
refused to go to the back of the boss,
which,
uh,

1647
01:35:02.871 --> 01:35:05.660
African Americans were forced to go to the back of the bus.
When you look at her,

1648
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:08.900
I don't know if it's the lighting or whatever it is,

1649
01:35:08.901 --> 01:35:13.010
but a lot of people think she looks Asian and it's six Filipino or someone along

1650
01:35:13.011 --> 01:35:13.400
those lines.

1651
01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:17.960
And then the other one behind me is Elvis who I don't believe was ever really

1652
01:35:17.961 --> 01:35:20.600
arrested.
No,
that's a mock.
Yeah.
This is,
uh,

1653
01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:25.070
this is a mugshot from when he met Nixon.
You know,
that famous photo.

1654
01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:26.630
He brought a gun on that plane.

1655
01:35:26.690 --> 01:35:29.240
Pull that photo up just to make sure we're telling the truth.

1656
01:35:29.241 --> 01:35:32.300
Like it's the same clothes that he's wearing.
Elvis meets Nixon.

1657
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:37.100
There's a famous one that I have because I have um,
um,

1658
01:35:37.130 --> 01:35:38.000
the Jessica,

1659
01:35:38.001 --> 01:35:42.020
the dancing outlaw from the wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia.
It's,

1660
01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:46.310
it's hit the,
the devil,
uh,
meeting,
um,

1661
01:35:46.311 --> 01:35:50.280
Nixon and Nixon is Jesco and the devil is a,

1662
01:35:50.630 --> 01:35:51.470
the dancing outlaw.

1663
01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:55.880
The dancing or the devil is expressing you never listen to Hank three.
Fuck yeah.

1664
01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:58.070
Hank three's a best.
You go on your podcast.

1665
01:35:58.190 --> 01:36:00.950
I would love to get him on my podcast and everyone reach out to hey three and

1666
01:36:00.951 --> 01:36:02.540
get them on Joe's pub.
Can I just tell you this?

1667
01:36:02.541 --> 01:36:05.690
Sturgill Simpson sent me a fucking text message today.

1668
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:09.800
He's number fucking one in country on iTunes.

1669
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:14.930
I've been telling everybody about Sturgill Simpson.
I went for a period of like,

1670
01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:17.940
I'm not bullshit.
And this is the Amazon thing that's stored.

1671
01:36:17.941 --> 01:36:21.200
Storage just sent me downloading it right now.
He's number one.

1672
01:36:21.201 --> 01:36:25.880
Number two is the fucking,
the definitive collection of Patsy Cline.

1673
01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:30.630
Oh,
booed.
That is fucking amazing.
Ooh,
you can't see it.

1674
01:36:30.631 --> 01:36:34.430
It's too bright that sturgeon sturgeon is number one on Amazon right now.

1675
01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:35.420
By the way,
with it,

1676
01:36:35.530 --> 01:36:37.330
<v 0>no</v>

1677
01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:40.760
<v 6>big record support.
He's done all this shit independently.</v>

1678
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:43.550
That Sturgill right here.
This is his,
uh,
his album.

1679
01:36:43.730 --> 01:36:47.180
This shit is number one right now on Amazon.
I swear to God,

1680
01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:50.690
if you like any good music,
forget about country.

1681
01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:53.240
Cause I know there's a lot of people to go do Rogan.

1682
01:36:53.450 --> 01:36:57.710
You'd go fucking get a pretty good book.
Coast,
you're okays,
you asy commentary.

1683
01:36:57.711 --> 01:37:01.670
You're kind of biased,
but God damn you fucking taste in music sucks.

1684
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:06.530
Listened to me.
Just if you like any country,
if you like Johnny Cash,

1685
01:37:06.531 --> 01:37:09.530
if you don't like Johnny Cash,
you need to kill yourself,
okay?

1686
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:13.670
Or you need to go to the woods and then think about things,

1687
01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:16.940
then listen to it again.
And if you still don't like it,
then kill yourself.

1688
01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:20.330
But if you view like Johnny Cash,
please listen,

1689
01:37:20.331 --> 01:37:25.250
I Sturgill Simpson because what sturgeon is doing is what Johnny's doing is what

1690
01:37:25.251 --> 01:37:28.040
Joe Cocker did is what all these motherfuckers did.

1691
01:37:28.041 --> 01:37:31.440
They sing from the heart and everybody's heart as different.
Okay.

1692
01:37:32.370 --> 01:37:36.410
This is one reason why Sarah Maclaughlin makes you feel bad when you watch that

1693
01:37:36.411 --> 01:37:40.550
goddamn commercial with the puppies.
Okay.
Because of her voice.

1694
01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:43.970
It's almost like a dirty trick.
Her voice is so powerful.

1695
01:37:44.290 --> 01:37:45.123
<v 0>Nice.</v>

1696
01:37:49.810 --> 01:37:54.030
<v 6>And you washed in a sad little puppy and like,
fuck,
I need to adopt another dog.</v>

1697
01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:56.190
Already have two dogs,
three fucking cats.

1698
01:37:56.430 --> 01:38:00.540
<v 1>But you want one,
you want to help out.
Right.
Almost adopted one in Vietnam.</v>

1699
01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:04.140
Did you round?
It was by a campfire and it was been a cage by campfire night.

1700
01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:06.990
We'd take it out at night and we'd let it sleep with us in bed.

1701
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:10.020
It was in a cage was in the cage at night and he'll put it in the cage.

1702
01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:14.880
The people didn't fucking Vietnam.
They also eat them,

1703
01:38:14.881 --> 01:38:18.000
so,
so you have this Justin a cage.

1704
01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:23.290
It's a very lucky to be in a game in his stomach.
I just bought surge.

1705
01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:25.790
I just spot stirred.
You'll Simpson's album.
Everyone.

1706
01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:28.440
I just thought of them bought by the first one to the first one is pretty

1707
01:38:28.441 --> 01:38:29.070
fucking dope it.

1708
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:32.790
But everyone go online also and rate and review that album because that helps

1709
01:38:32.791 --> 01:38:37.080
him keep him on top.
Helps keep people noticing him and do that with my podcast.

1710
01:38:37.081 --> 01:38:38.910
I love you guys.
Yes or not.

1711
01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:41.140
<v 6>Um,
definitely do</v>

1712
01:38:42.810 --> 01:38:45.460
kind to say we're not high top mountain.
Yeah,

1713
01:38:45.461 --> 01:38:49.070
high top mountain was this first one,
which is really good.
You know,

1714
01:38:49.130 --> 01:38:51.440
<v 1>my wife,

1719
01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:11.930
That's where Suzanne's from and you know,
she wants to do it a hometown show.

We've been so lucky and meeting so many cool people.

1726
01:39:32.570 --> 01:39:36.200
I like when you have bands on fuck.

1729
01:39:43.341 --> 01:39:46.490
why is Everlast last CD not up in that fucking hand anymore.

1730
01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:49.340
Put it back over last fall down.
It's an earthquake.

1731
01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.680
That album terrorists was amazing.

1732
01:39:54.710 --> 01:39:59.000
all studio or all acoustic of the,
a life acoustic instead of,

1733
01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:02.370
he did a play on a life aquatic and even made a,

1734
01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:06.320
his CD cover look like a,
a life aquatic like with his face.

1735
01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:11.390
He's just a cool motherfucker got me into a box cutter.

1736
01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.310
Patsy.
Oh Dude.
Yeah.
I talked to him when I go to Philly.
Vinnie paths.
Yeah,

1737
01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:19.040
I talked to Vinnie pads.
Every time I go to Philly I go,
hey everyone tickets.

1738
01:40:19.250 --> 01:40:22.100
And we're always like,
oh,
flip schedules.
Yeah.

1739
01:40:22.130 --> 01:40:24.500
I've had that issue with him as well.
He's a good dude though.

1740
01:40:24.501 --> 01:40:27.230
And I like his shit,
man.
He's a good rapper.

1741
01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:31.340
He's a big boxing kind of sore as well.
He knows a lot of shit about boxing.

1742
01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:35.030
Yeah man.
That's the beautiful thing about the times we live in,
you know,

1743
01:40:35.110 --> 01:40:38.620
times you live in and are connecting us to so many cool people.
You know,
we're,

1744
01:40:38.630 --> 01:40:41.060
we're living in strange times,
man.
This is,

1745
01:40:41.061 --> 01:40:45.860
this is the time where the boundaries between people are slowly dissolving.

1746
01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:46.750
You know,

1747
01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:50.710
<v 1>we're that one radio station on the way to Vegas with podcasting.</v>

1748
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:53.020
We are that one radio station.
Yeah.
It's,

1749
01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.050
it's like the people that are cool or picking it up and they're like,

1750
01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:58.240
and I love when you run into people that are like,

1751
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:59.740
I told you about this a million times,

1752
01:40:59.741 --> 01:41:03.100
but like I met these two dudes under a banyan tree and Hawaii and they're like

1753
01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:04.840
the machine,
oh fuck.

1754
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:09.580
And we just ended up catching up about your latest bobcat Goldthwait episode and

1755
01:41:09.581 --> 01:41:11.980
just bullshitting.
Right.
You know,
that does those things.

1756
01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:15.580
It's cool to be a part of this community.
And I don't feel like,
you know,

1757
01:41:15.581 --> 01:41:18.150
like podcasting in general with radio lab and with,

1758
01:41:18.330 --> 01:41:21.000
with what's going on with the,
with cereal like it.

1759
01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:24.460
I haven't paid attention to cereal.
Are you into that?
It's really good.

1760
01:41:25.290 --> 01:41:28.240
Keep hearing shit about how being an amazing,
like the really,

1761
01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:33.250
it's really good for six,
six episodes and then it falls apart.
It's one point.

1762
01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:36.130
It's like Doug,
you and Dunkin go and hunt for Sasquatch.
He's like,

1763
01:41:36.131 --> 01:41:40.210
I would have heard of the guy got out.
So I like,

1764
01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.800
I guess he does it good.
I guess there's,

1765
01:41:41.890 --> 01:41:45.100
I guess I know the ending of this a problem,
right?

1766
01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:49.900
That's every fucking Ufo show.
Yeah.
Did she ain't find no Ufo.
It's,
by the way,

1767
01:41:49.901 --> 01:41:51.490
by the way,
I'm telling you,
you're a joke.

1768
01:41:51.491 --> 01:41:54.670
Cause that when you and Duncan went Humberside yeah.

1769
01:41:54.671 --> 01:41:59.200
You said you're a joke is like if they had founded I would've heard about it.

1770
01:41:59.201 --> 01:42:03.970
Yeah.
And I,
when you,
I mean,
I think I called Duncan and I was like,

1771
01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:08.080
Hey,
just did you find it?
He was like,
burden would be on the news.

1772
01:42:08.110 --> 01:42:12.070
We had a good time talking to now we're high as fuck.

1773
01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:13.540
Have you watched that show?

1774
01:42:13.541 --> 01:42:17.620
If you pay attention and understand and you just watch those episodes where me

1775
01:42:17.621 --> 01:42:20.470
and Duncan are wandering through the woods were barbecued.

1776
01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:24.420
We're barely conscious.
I love that guy so much.
He's my face.

1777
01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:28.780
Well there's no my favorite but he's my favorite.
There's all my favorite.

1778
01:42:28.781 --> 01:42:31.360
Joey's my favorite.
You're my favorite.
Well this is a lot of favorites.

1779
01:42:31.361 --> 01:42:34.720
Brian's my favorite.
I even love Jamie.
I'll call Dunkin's.

1780
01:42:34.721 --> 01:42:38.890
My goto panic is like if you want to freak out when I'm going through shit like

1781
01:42:38.891 --> 01:42:39.830
real shit that I

1782
01:42:40.590 --> 01:42:45.170
<v 7>you need to really think about is the fact that man,
we might not even be here.</v>

1783
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:49.040
We might be in some sort of simulation and some alternative dimension.

1784
01:42:49.041 --> 01:42:52.430
There might be people looking over his right now deciding whether or not to

1785
01:42:52.431 --> 01:42:53.710
delete you.

1786
01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:57.550
<v 1>Do you want it?
I'll give you my example of how g Doug is a genius.
We go,</v>

1787
01:42:57.770 --> 01:43:00.770
he comes on to do my park,
I assume to do my hot gas,
and he goes,
sure.

1788
01:43:00.771 --> 01:43:01.604
We find the time.

1789
01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:04.610
And at the time I was going through the book stuff and I had a panic attack in

1790
01:43:04.611 --> 01:43:06.320
the middle.
The podcast,
like five minutes in,

1791
01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:10.640
I started spiraling out and this is what I love about Dunkin's brain.
He goes,

1792
01:43:10.890 --> 01:43:14.240
he goes,
man,
Hey,
you know,
David Letterman's never grown as an individual.

1793
01:43:14.241 --> 01:43:16.310
It's playing the same character.
There's no rules to this shit.

1794
01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:17.900
Let's do a guided meditation.

1795
01:43:18.230 --> 01:43:20.930
And he'd get leads me through a guided meditation for 20 minutes on my podcast.

1796
01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.820
He just leaves it,
you're at,

1797
01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:27.200
there's a tiger coming out of the river and you're just in your intuit and I and

1798
01:43:27.201 --> 01:43:30.040
you pop out on the inside.
You're like,
motherfucker.
I was like,

1799
01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:33.860
I met with the Zen Buddhist monks in Japan,
Zen Buddhist monk in Japan.

1800
01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:38.090
There'll be did a meditation.
And I told him,
I said,
will you do me a favor?

1801
01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:42.870
Check out Dunkin.
Troubled hot.
He told the monks and download Dunkin's.

1802
01:43:43.610 --> 01:43:47.270
I told his mom he was a wreck.
He was a,
he was a westernized a tad bit.

1803
01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:49.760
He spoke English,
but go checkout Dunkin man,

1804
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:52.070
tell me what you think about this guy because I really

1805
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.670
<v 6>do.
He's got a,</v>

1806
01:43:52.670 --> 01:43:57.470
he's got a special thing about the way he processes and I don't know if it's him

1807
01:43:57.471 --> 01:44:02.150
having gone through,
you know,
cancer and having to deal with that shit and be us,

1808
01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:06.350
you know?
But like he's a,
I've fucking can't say enough about that guy.

1809
01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:11.450
He's my goto panic anxiety and he knows it.
So he answers the call.
No,

1810
01:44:11.451 --> 01:44:16.280
he's a good dude,
man.
He's a good dude.
Like four months,

1811
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.240
Duncan,
I lived together maybe a little bit more than four months.

1812
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:24.710
I forget how many months it was,
but he called me up.
He's like,
dude,

1813
01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:28.640
I'm in a motel right now.
My girlfriend kicked me out.

1814
01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:33.590
I don't know what I'm going to do.
I go,
come live with me.
I go,
let's have fun.

1815
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:38.540
I go,
come on dude.
I go,
I got an isolation tank.
There's a gym.

1816
01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:43.160
I go,
come on,
come have fun.
So this is like in the height of fear factor.

1817
01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:47.840
Dunkin came and lived with me.
Oh,
you live with me for awhile.
You know,

1818
01:44:47.841 --> 01:44:51.710
I live with Tate for awhile and live at Dunkin and fascinating.
I don't know him,

1819
01:44:51.711 --> 01:44:56.030
but I follow them on Instagram.
Caveman coffee,
ceo.com he seems like he's,

1820
01:44:56.540 --> 01:45:00.680
he seems like he's,
he's,
he gives me,
it looks like he doesn't drink,

1821
01:45:00.681 --> 01:45:02.900
doesn't smoke to undo and he doesn't,
he's super straight edge.

1822
01:45:02.901 --> 01:45:07.400
She lives like a fucking very rewarding early morning cup of coffee life.

1823
01:45:07.730 --> 01:45:08.990
Well you know what Tate is?

1824
01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:13.370
Tate is a robust and enthusiastic individual.

1825
01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:17.150
He's very happy.
Like Tate loves to give people hugs and it gets,

1826
01:45:17.151 --> 01:45:20.450
loves to get excited about shit.
That's why he loves coffee.
They need to do,

1827
01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:23.720
they need to do a show with him on travel channel called the baby monster where

1828
01:45:23.721 --> 01:45:27.940
he just goes into big
because he's a big dude,
but he's a,

1829
01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:31.460
he seems like the nicest guy in the world and he just goes to the places where,

1830
01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:35.010
you know,
when you draw a prediction about a person,
the way they,

1831
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:38.060
based on their way they look,
but then he just connects with everyone.
I mean,

1832
01:45:38.061 --> 01:45:39.200
every picture I see him,

1833
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:42.500
it's like came in with warrior paint with his fucking beard.

1834
01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:46.200
He does a lot of movies,
man.
He didn't like that Denzel Washington movies done.

1835
01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:49.740
He's done a ton of movies like over the last two years especially.

1836
01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:53.870
He's really successful.
Yeah,
he's a super good,
bad guy in movies.

1837
01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:58.760
He's cause he said,
he said what a giant dude.
He's scary.
He's up.
He's a sweetie.

1838
01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:01.160
He's a really nice guy.
Did was it you and him?

1839
01:46:01.161 --> 01:46:03.110
I just retold this story to somebody.

1840
01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:07.940
Was it you and him with the guy that was drunk and the elevator and the and the

1841
01:46:07.941 --> 01:46:10.250
hard rock hotel.
He didn't just knock on the door.

1842
01:46:10.251 --> 01:46:13.630
He pounded on tape before take got to his hotel room.

1843
01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:17.640
This dude was telling them that,
you know,
he was like a,
that's my room and take.

1844
01:46:17.641 --> 01:46:21.050
It's like opening the door and he's like,
no,
this is my room.
He was like,

1845
01:46:21.051 --> 01:46:23.730
I told you it's my fucking room.
I think that's really big too.

1846
01:46:23.731 --> 01:46:28.160
She frat looking kid and you know,
Tate's up big guy.

1847
01:46:28.161 --> 01:46:29.780
He's like six,
four,

1848
01:46:30.110 --> 01:46:33.630
200 and God knows whatever the fuck you ways,
you know,

1849
01:46:34.930 --> 01:46:38.960
black beard.
Yeah.
He's a big dude.
So this guy was bigger than Tate.

1850
01:46:38.961 --> 01:46:43.490
Like he's such a bully that he's like bullying,
obvious giant people,

1851
01:46:43.670 --> 01:46:48.230
you know,
like wow,
are you crazy?
So take goat tape,
gives this guy a free pass,

1852
01:46:48.231 --> 01:46:53.231
goes into his room and I'm in the room adjoining him and Eddie Bravo and I are

1853
01:46:53.551 --> 01:46:57.420
in the room.
I don't want him were baked as fucks and let us even seems real.

1854
01:46:57.421 --> 01:47:00.210
Right?
We're in this hotel room and um,

1855
01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:04.200
we hear pounding on the door and you know,
we have adjoining rooms.

1856
01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:08.730
So I opened our door and Tate's door was cracked and I pushed Tate store out and

1857
01:47:08.731 --> 01:47:11.940
we go into Tate's room and then we'd go out into the hallway and we saw were

1858
01:47:11.941 --> 01:47:15.810
exiting out of Tate's room,
you know,
I dunno,
sign of solidarity or some shit.

1859
01:47:15.810 --> 01:47:16.800
And then when we did it that way,

1860
01:47:16.801 --> 01:47:20.110
but this dude is standing over Tate and he's bigger than Tate.
He's got,

1861
01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:23.370
I told you is my fucking room bitch and tastes like a,

1862
01:47:23.371 --> 01:47:26.190
I don't know what you're talking about man,
because obviously I have the key.

1863
01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:30.220
How did I get the key to your room?
You know,
that kind of shit.
Trying to egos,

1864
01:47:30.450 --> 01:47:33.240
you know the guy keeps talking to him and take goes,

1865
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:36.150
why don't you just swing on me,
man?
Come on.
Why don't you swing on me?

1866
01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.400
And the dude like moves forward.

1867
01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:42.760
Tate leg kicks him and then pulls guard.
He says,
oh wow.

1868
01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:47.310
And then pulls him down onto them and then all of a sudden throws this dude in

1869
01:47:47.311 --> 01:47:50.100
Alma Plata.
And then from the Omoplata,

1870
01:47:50.970 --> 01:47:53.550
right when he's got this guy on the ground,
that guy's baffled.

1871
01:47:53.551 --> 01:47:55.440
He has no idea what the fuck just happened.

1872
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:59.520
Somehow or another through the shittiest luck of all time.

1873
01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:03.540
This is six foot six giant man who's been pushing people around.

1874
01:48:03.541 --> 01:48:08.541
His whole 22 years on this planet has run into the wrong mother fucker in a

1875
01:48:09.241 --> 01:48:13.860
hotel lobby while he's drunk at the hard rock cafe in Vegas.

1876
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:17.670
So Tate pulls,
pulls an Omoplata off on this guy,

1877
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:22.350
and he's got this guy face down,
all of his weight on them hipped out.
And these,

1878
01:48:22.650 --> 01:48:26.790
these fucking security guards show up out of nowhere.
And they go,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

1879
01:48:26.791 --> 01:48:31.290
Slow down.
Slow down.
I go,
dude.
I go,
don't worry.
It's fine.
And the guy goes,

1880
01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:35.430
you're the fear factor guy.
And I go,
yeah,
what's up man?
I go,
listen,
it's fine.

1881
01:48:35.431 --> 01:48:36.810
He's just sealing to choke him to sleep.

1882
01:48:40.590 --> 01:48:43.460
Tate says he's just going to choke him to sell.

1883
01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:46.590
When I say he's just gonna choke him,
sleep tape says,
okay,

1884
01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:50.550
so take just transitions from the Omoplata to the rear.
Naked choke.

1885
01:48:50.551 --> 01:48:52.410
Chokes this guy completely unconscious.

1886
01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:57.740
Don't head down his friends who had been with him the entire time apologizing

1887
01:48:58.730 --> 01:49:02.640
forum.
We're happy node who's beating them up?
Pick this guy up.
He's like,

1888
01:49:02.641 --> 01:49:05.970
what happened?
What happened?
They push them into an elevator and he disappears.

1889
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:10.290
They push them into this elevator and the doors closed and this guy vanishes and

1890
01:49:10.291 --> 01:49:13.770
we never see this guy again.
And this is the end.
Taten never heard him.

1891
01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:17.430
He never punched him.
He all he did.
Even when he kicked him,

1892
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:21.390
he only kicked him to get the guy to react and then pull them like you kicked

1893
01:49:21.391 --> 01:49:21.931
him light.

1894
01:49:21.931 --> 01:49:25.790
He just hit him with a light inside leg kick and Tate was so confident about it.

1895
01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:27.270
It was just coming off of the ultimate fighter.

1896
01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:32.520
He's just fighting professional fighters.
A couple of weeks ago,
leg kicks.

1897
01:49:32.521 --> 01:49:35.250
This guy dragged him to the ground.
Okay.

1898
01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:38.040
I'm obsessed with small details and stories.
They make a story for me.

1899
01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:39.480
My favorite parts of this story,
okay,

1900
01:49:39.481 --> 01:49:42.750
is that you guys are sharing adjoining rooms.
Eddie Bravo's there.
I love that.

1901
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:44.970
I love that because what you have is a coach at that story.

1902
01:49:45.150 --> 01:49:47.920
I love that you say a subtle leg kick

1903
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:51.970
<v 1>and then he throws him into an Omoplata like the fact that that makes a story</v>

1904
01:49:51.971 --> 01:49:55.600
still fucking good and then when this card comes up,

1905
01:49:55.601 --> 01:49:58.180
you go Madorie my friends,
a professional fighter,

1906
01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.110
he's just going to put him to sleep.
He didn't say that.

1907
01:50:00.111 --> 01:50:01.100
I didn't say he was a professional firm.

1908
01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:03.490
Whatever you want is not going to get hurt.
He's just going to put them to sleep.

1909
01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:04.270
Oh.

1910
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:05.500
<v 6>And when I say just going to put them in,</v>

1911
01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:10.720
and it all started because the dude said something and then Tate said somethin

1912
01:50:10.861 --> 01:50:15.760
like relax dude.
And the guy backed away.
And then Eddie Bravo,

1913
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:20.320
any bravo goes,
you're the one who's talking shit.
And then backing up.

1914
01:50:21.310 --> 01:50:25.540
Oh,
and when he said that,
because Eddie kind of instigated it a little bit,

1915
01:50:25.570 --> 01:50:27.760
the guy got what's coming.
Don't get me wrong,

1916
01:50:27.890 --> 01:50:30.250
because the guy was the one that told Tate,
that was his room.

1917
01:50:30.370 --> 01:50:32.230
The guy was the one who banged on the door.

1918
01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:36.790
But when take came out of the room was zero fear in his eyes and a slight smirk.

1919
01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:39.850
I think the dude,
even through his drunk and Hayes was going,

1920
01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:43.510
I might've just stuck my fucking hand in the wrong bees.

1921
01:50:44.130 --> 01:50:44.963
<v 1>I've done that.</v>

1922
01:50:46.410 --> 01:50:49.350
You've got into a fight with a guy in that he smiles you see as a dope races and

1923
01:50:49.351 --> 01:50:52.620
you're like,
oh,
I'm fucking dope.
Make you vulnerable.

1924
01:50:52.621 --> 01:50:55.270
Why would adult braces be assigned?
That's a sign of vanity.
Oh,

1925
01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:57.800
you don't read people the way I do.
I'd be confident in that.

1926
01:50:57.801 --> 01:51:02.490
I saw if I saw a grown man with adult braces,
I be like,
what about your nose?
No,

1927
01:51:02.730 --> 01:51:05.040
we're going to do about your ears once you fix your teeth.

1928
01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:07.860
So it's just a weird headlines sign.
I'm gonna fuck you up.

1929
01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:12.210
I read it as a guy whose kids didn't care about his dad and mom didn't care

1930
01:51:12.211 --> 01:51:14.730
about a smile so they didn't care about slapping him around.

1931
01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:18.660
So he's tougher than me.
Like I got an appliance when I was like eight.

1932
01:51:19.230 --> 01:51:21.300
So like I look at it the opposite way.
I look at like,

1933
01:51:21.301 --> 01:51:25.440
I remember the kid that didn't get appliances and braces and they were the kids

1934
01:51:25.441 --> 01:51:28.830
who parents let them smoke cigarettes and I was like,
Oh fuck that.

1935
01:51:28.831 --> 01:51:32.550
I'm not fucking with that guy.
That's interesting.
Yeah,
I read it opposite.
Hey,

1936
01:51:32.670 --> 01:51:34.560
can you do okay?
I know you're going to,

1937
01:51:34.561 --> 01:51:37.870
I know you're not gonna like this idea it sometimes I keep talking sometimes,

1938
01:51:37.871 --> 01:51:41.590
like sometimes I pitch,
sometimes I feel like I say,

1939
01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:44.860
I read you when I shouldn't read you,
but then I,
okay,
what?

1940
01:51:44.910 --> 01:51:48.630
Just me or everybody you specifically,
you're the most,

1941
01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:52.740
you're like a fucking squirrel.
I can never figure out where you're going.

1942
01:51:54.450 --> 01:51:57.630
I go,
I go the Joe,
Joe will think this is funny.

1943
01:51:57.631 --> 01:52:01.230
And then I say it and then you go,
why?
Why would you say that?
And then I go fuck.

1944
01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:02.760
But okay,
here's my thought.

1945
01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:06.980
What if you did like an entourage show but with her stop right now.

1946
01:52:07.050 --> 01:52:11.250
What do I say?
No shows mother fucker.
Hold on.
Stop.
Actually back it up.

1947
01:52:11.251 --> 01:52:14.280
Pack it up.
Pack it up.
Let me just look at pitch it please.

1948
01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:19.560
It's still ours.
What about,
what about like 10 years ago,

1949
01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:22.530
but he didn't years ago.
Yeah,
like I don't want it now,

1950
01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:24.870
but like a 10 years ago where you cast it,
you ride it,

1951
01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:29.900
but about your life off your factor with hanging out with mixed martial artists

1952
01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:33.510
live in the wild like pot times,

1953
01:52:33.930 --> 01:52:38.170
early beginnings of fame.
Much like entourage,
which I was a fan of a,

1954
01:52:38.190 --> 01:52:43.190
maybe not everyone was nothing cause this one as well as the time I pitched the

1955
01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:49.750
snake,
the snake Tamer to Russell Simmons make taint.

1956
01:52:50.850 --> 01:52:53.480
No,
wouldn't that be,
I'd like to see that.

1957
01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:57.560
These old stories and they were only have a tank.
Just a line.

1958
01:52:58.150 --> 01:53:01.880
Is this nice of Dick?
How does snakes fuck?
I'll top of each other,
I think.

1959
01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:05.240
I think they have an internal Dick.
Yeah.
It goes into their body,

1960
01:53:05.241 --> 01:53:08.760
but it comes out.
I'm sure you guys are so tactical thing.

1961
01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:11.480
You guys should probably teach science courses.

1962
01:53:13.190 --> 01:53:14.580
Fucking blue bird cry.

1963
01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:19.430
<v 6>You wouldn't do that for my friend wouldn't do a scripted show.</v>

1964
01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:22.970
It'd be drinking maker's mark.
No,
I'm done,
dude.
I'm done.
No,
just produce it.

1965
01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:25.060
Not starting over.
It's over.
Why?

1966
01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:30.460
Because anytime I'm spending producing a television show is time that I'm not

1967
01:53:30.801 --> 01:53:33.770
playing freeze tag with my kids.
I'm not doing it.
Okay.

1968
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:37.730
I got enough time in this world.
I'm doing podcasts.

1969
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:40.190
I'm doing a UFC commentary.

1970
01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:45.290
I'm doing standup comedy and sleeping.
I just love those old stories.

1971
01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:50.370
Don't be scared.
homey.com
to get some ice.

1972
01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:57.260
Yeah.
I've no desire to be involved in anything scripted ever again.
I'm doing a,

1973
01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:59.690
you know,
I'm doing an episode of Mark Marin's show coming up.

1974
01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:02.900
I'm psyched about that.
I'll do like little episodes of shit,
but

1975
01:54:05.210 --> 01:54:07.550
there's a lot of things I want to do.
Man.
I want to be a pilot.

1976
01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:11.050
I want to fucking go to the moon.
I'm going to fucking wrestle hires.
How about,

1977
01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:14.240
how about I would love to learn how to fly planes.
I just don't have the time.

1978
01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:19.520
It's a lot.
I get obsessed with shit very easily,
so my,

1979
01:54:19.570 --> 01:54:23.330
my problem is never not having things to do.

1980
01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:26.780
My problem is never being bored.
My promise.
The total opposite.

1981
01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:29.840
My problem is God damn is not enough time to do everything.

1982
01:54:30.170 --> 01:54:33.080
There's not enough time to do everything.
It does feel like that.

1983
01:54:33.081 --> 01:54:35.780
I wanted to learn how to fly helicopters after beating New Zealand.

1984
01:54:35.870 --> 01:54:39.600
Have you seen bill burns new special for everybody who is listening to this

1985
01:54:39.601 --> 01:54:40.850
podcast?
Please.

1986
01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:44.660
I am apologetic to the extreme right now.

1987
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:47.150
I know I've been repetitive about this.

1988
01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:52.420
I love when someone does a special that is legit funny and bill burrs new

1989
01:54:52.911 --> 01:54:56.830
special is legit funny and he's got a bit about fucking helicopters.

1990
01:54:56.850 --> 01:55:01.160
One of the funniest silly is goofiest bits.
I love it.

1991
01:55:01.190 --> 01:55:03.590
It's a fucking great.

1992
01:55:04.050 --> 01:55:07.620
<v 1>It released the day I went to Tokyo and I was going to,
I bought,</v>

1993
01:55:07.621 --> 01:55:10.860
yours was the last one I bought.
I get it on.
It's super simple.

1994
01:55:10.861 --> 01:55:13.990
Go on comedy central.com I got yours actually

1995
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:16.720
<v 6>download mine.
Right?
Netflix doesn't let you download it.</v>

1996
01:55:16.721 --> 01:55:21.280
You have to stream it so you can't like load it on my iPad mini.

1997
01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:24.940
I got to know my opinion.
Netflix lets you do that.
Comedy Central.

1998
01:55:24.970 --> 01:55:26.950
It was the link.
Codeine.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1999
01:55:26.951 --> 01:55:29.890
but I'm saying Bill Burns is on Netflix and I don't think Netflix,

2000
01:55:29.891 --> 01:55:31.270
I think they just said recently,

2001
01:55:31.271 --> 01:55:35.350
they're not going to allow you to ever watch things offline.
Right.

2002
01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:40.090
It's not the case.
That's unfortunate.
It's an unfortunate,
well yeah,

2003
01:55:40.091 --> 01:55:44.010
you've got to get me an offering,
but planes.
What about fucking

2004
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:46.890
<v 1>planes to our watch everything.
Can you load it up?</v>

2005
01:55:46.891 --> 01:55:50.550
Can you load bill's podcast up and then buffer it up on a plane?
Can you load?

2006
01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:53.610
You can't do it.
You can download,
you can download it,

2007
01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:56.430
but you can't download it because you can't watch online.
You have to stream it.

2008
01:55:56.670 --> 01:56:00.120
So if you're flying Australia,
you couldn't watch something on Netflix.

2009
01:56:00.150 --> 01:56:04.740
I can see yours.
I had years.
All My,
I get a download mine,
you pay five bucks,

2010
01:56:04.741 --> 01:56:07.050
you own it,
it's yours.
And it came to end.

2011
01:56:07.070 --> 01:56:10.700
It didn't take that right now unless you,
unless they have it also on iTunes.

2012
01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:14.600
Air will be available later.
Probably on.
Yeah,

2013
01:56:14.601 --> 01:56:18.810
but I got a year later.
I feel like,
I feel like I'm waiting out the,
the,
the,

2014
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:23.820
the wave to find out how the fuck to do an hour these days.
Cause I don't know,

2015
01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:26.310
it's like we,
everyone was like,

2016
01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:29.880
oh put it online for five bucks like Louis C K and now it's like,

2017
01:56:29.881 --> 01:56:33.960
oh everyone does Netflix.
Oh you can't watch it online and do it on comedy.

2018
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:35.640
I liked the,
I liked the fact that yours,

2019
01:56:36.090 --> 01:56:39.870
the way yours was done for me personally as a user was the light more user

2020
01:56:39.871 --> 01:56:40.890
friendly?
Well,

2021
01:56:40.891 --> 01:56:45.690
the reason why I did this latest one with both is because I knew my,

2022
01:56:45.691 --> 01:56:50.550
for the last one I did.
It was,
it was good to release it online.

2023
01:56:50.551 --> 01:56:52.240
Yeah.
It was good to release it online.

2024
01:56:52.241 --> 01:56:56.090
And do the five buck thing and it made all its money back.
But then the,

2025
01:56:56.230 --> 01:56:57.210
and it made some money,

2026
01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:00.030
but then I sold it to comedy central so it made more money.

2027
01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:04.800
But the comedy central model,
the way they're doing it now allows you to do both.

2028
01:57:05.010 --> 01:57:09.330
They put it on regular television and then they have an uncensored 18 minutes

2029
01:57:09.331 --> 01:57:12.540
longer on the internet.
That's what I want.
I don't want the one,
I don't know.

2030
01:57:13.230 --> 01:57:16.410
It's perfect.
It's bought.
But you might,
I mean he,
look,

2031
01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:19.800
it's good to have it like flipping through the channels and they catch you're

2032
01:57:19.801 --> 01:57:23.820
special and you're killing.
They go,
Holy Shit.
Burt crushers.
Fucking hilarious.

2033
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.200
And then you submit a scalpel.
I saw his special a lot two nights ago.

2034
01:57:28.350 --> 01:57:31.880
I couldn't sleep a man cave and it was on.
And I said,
you know,

2035
01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:35.280
I don't think I've ever seen them live.
I did the same.
Well I have seen him live,

2036
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:39.510
but I did the same thing I was watching on showtime in my hotel room and I was

2037
01:57:39.511 --> 01:57:43.350
like,
Holy Shit,
this is a really good special fucking really good at texting.

2038
01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:48.090
We text him,
text him now,
but she said his brilliance is in its simplicity.

2039
01:57:48.091 --> 01:57:51.900
I let's go.
Keep going.
Keep going forward.
Yeah.
Well he's a funny dude.

2040
01:57:51.901 --> 01:57:52.770
He's a good dude too.

2041
01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:57.930
But the point being that I know him already and I already know he's funny and I

2042
01:57:57.931 --> 01:58:02.430
enjoyed it.
Watching it on TV.
Randomly flipping through the dials.
Boom.

2043
01:58:02.431 --> 01:58:06.420
Look at Sebastian.
Okay,
let's see what Sebastian's up to and I watched special.

2044
01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:10.120
Really good.
Uh,
yeah.
I Dunno.

2045
01:58:11.070 --> 01:58:16.070
My next hour special is going to be at the DC Improv at 11:00 AM in the morning.

2046
01:58:17.850 --> 01:58:20.070
What a good idea.
It's my call in sick to work tour.

2047
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:25.370
That's the appropriate response.

2048
01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:30.650
This is just shit idea for people who work out.
I bet it has.

2049
01:58:30.950 --> 01:58:34.280
What you want to generate some fucking people on welfare and your aunt and your

2050
01:58:34.281 --> 01:58:38.710
audience.
No,
I go and do right.
Unemployment and I,

2051
01:58:38.770 --> 01:58:41.590
and I drink it radio sometimes and then I go right to often times.

2052
01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:44.620
Sometimes a lot of times.
But yeah,
I've been calling in sick to work show.

2053
01:58:44.621 --> 01:58:46.730
It's been selling out everywhere you,
you,

2054
01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:49.870
she even knew an 11:00 AM shows all the time.
Shows all over the country.

2055
01:58:49.871 --> 01:58:52.990
You're serious.
I mean dead serious.
I thought you were joking.
No,

2056
01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:56.470
first of all was in DC.
Sold out in 20 minutes.
That's it.

2057
01:58:56.590 --> 01:58:58.240
We're doing comedy during the day though.

2058
01:58:58.241 --> 01:59:00.610
I mean the clubs like identical to the night.

2059
01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:03.910
The only thing I'm afraid is I'm not giving them something different enough.

2060
01:59:03.911 --> 01:59:07.990
So like in Pittsburgh,
uh,
came like 30 tickets away from selling out.

2061
01:59:08.230 --> 01:59:12.310
Mitch Fatel came in and did a set and we all dressed in matching.

2062
01:59:12.490 --> 01:59:14.260
I wish I,
and maybe I'm overthinking it,

2063
01:59:14.261 --> 01:59:17.410
but I feel like there should be something more for an 11:00 AM show.

2064
01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:20.240
But it's like Saint Patty's day,
it's like,
why can't say Patty's I'd love to,

2065
01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:22.090
okay,
I'm taking this shit to the next level.

2066
01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:27.180
I need to find a spot to do a 5:00 AM show for 28 Nope,

2067
01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:31.070
5:00 AM four 20 is passe.
Do it.
I'm tired of this and Joe,
Joe,

2068
01:59:31.450 --> 01:59:35.620
I don't want you to be able to stay awake toe.
I want you to have to get out.
Joe,

2069
01:59:35.670 --> 01:59:39.940
do you know what my show is?
You're taking away the brilliance of that idea,

2070
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.710
which you just said is genius.

2071
01:59:42.190 --> 01:59:46.390
I want to set my alarm to wake up to have something to look forward to.
Yeah.

2072
01:59:46.391 --> 01:59:47.320
But really bizarre.

2073
01:59:47.321 --> 01:59:51.520
Like everybody there knows they fucked up and everybody knows that they got

2074
01:59:51.521 --> 01:59:56.521
there at 5:00 AM no or did they share 5:00 AM Joe Rogan in Edmonton?

2075
01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:01.470
Edmonton.
That's it.
Let's just say,
let's say dairy.

2076
02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:04.360
How Algorithms people have jobs then we need to do this in America.

2077
02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:09.400
Can't be in Canada where it's called Denver 5:00 AM show.
No you do with Denver.

2078
02:00:09.850 --> 02:00:13.150
It's gotta be somewhere weird like Albuquerque.
Okay.

2079
02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:15.220
But there's no comedy club in Albuquerque,

2080
02:00:15.490 --> 02:00:20.230
so we're going to have to do so many weirder.
Somewhere weirder.
Like Nashville,

2081
02:00:20.231 --> 02:00:24.080
South Dakota,
Nashville,
Nashville,
five in the morning,

2082
02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:29.680
5:00 AM show,
Hank sandwiches,
coughing,
Prozac.
But,
but the best exam,

2083
02:00:29.681 --> 02:00:33.190
which is you've ever had in Nashville and Mimosas?
No.

2084
02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:37.330
The best egg sandwiches you've ever had.
Um,
from the Rogan residents.

2085
02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:42.400
Cause I have chickens that wander around and they pick grass and they have yet

2086
02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:46.660
they have these eggs.
And have this dark orange yolk that tastes delicious.

2087
02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:49.030
You don't even know what eggs tastes like.
Here's what's the one,

2088
02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:52.480
some city slicker eggs thing.
Dot.

2089
02:00:52.490 --> 02:00:57.010
All you'll pale blond yolks.
Best thing of Vietnam was their egg sandwiches.

2090
02:00:57.490 --> 02:01:02.490
We're light crispy Vietnamese breads with two over easy eggs dumped inside it

2091
02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:06.910
with this hot sauce.
That was amazing.
Best things I've ever had.
I've aight fuck.

2092
02:01:07.570 --> 02:01:10.270
I'm going to bring in the Vietnamese woman to your house to make egg sandwiches.

2093
02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:15.150
Guess what?
You're not.
You can bring into my house.
She was doing that.
Teaching.

2094
02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:16.210
That chick where I live,

2095
02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:27.400
teach you good.
He wears the camera trying to skull you.

2096
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:32.250
Can you move it another way?
I try to do something.
One of the party,

2097
02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:33.401
you want to,

2098
02:01:33.401 --> 02:01:35.950
you want to smoke a joint and the travel channel doesn't let you know.

2099
02:01:35.951 --> 02:01:36.480
I don't know.

2100
02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:41.480
Your slave masters prohibit you from certain unauthorized Madison plant plant

2101
02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:47.250
<v 6>medicines.
Even when the federal government is,</v>

2102
02:01:47.251 --> 02:01:49.680
the federal government has recently relaxed.

2103
02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:54.300
All of it's a legislation when it comes to medical marijuana,

2104
02:01:54.301 --> 02:01:58.770
which by the way,
we all have prescriptions and you do I think by proxy

2105
02:02:00.810 --> 02:02:02.610
I will self diagnose you.

2106
02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:07.500
Intranet physician believed need marijuana.

2107
02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:13.080
I feel it's important for almost everything you do and everything that you do

2108
02:02:13.081 --> 02:02:16.980
without marijuana is to the detriment of the human race.

2109
02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:23.750
<v 1>I just keep thinking of this fucking owl thing and the guy standing outside</v>

2110
02:02:23.751 --> 02:02:26.600
Gelson's and people are coming to a bird feed,
slapping it out of their hands.

2111
02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:29.150
What the fuck you doing?
They're like,
and the guy pulls me aside.
He goes,
hey man,

2112
02:02:29.151 --> 02:02:30.870
there's another way we can go down threes.

2113
02:02:34.940 --> 02:02:39.740
<v 6>Some asshole of one of those two handed saws.
Fucking pioneer.</v>

2114
02:02:40.010 --> 02:02:43.460
I love this fucking life pilgrim,
which is shitty.

2115
02:02:43.461 --> 02:02:48.410
So you have,
you seen these new dude,
there's these new fucking um,

2116
02:02:48.590 --> 02:02:52.070
these new machines that,
that uh,

2117
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.920
they cut the tree,
they strip all of the branches off the tree,

2118
02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:02.270
all the bark off the tree.
They saw it in the sections and drop it.

2119
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:05.030
Have you seen these days pull,
pull these things up?

2120
02:03:05.630 --> 02:03:09.890
There's these new machines that they use and it's almost unfair.
It's like

2121
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:12.770
I've been talking about this lately,

2122
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:17.720
like we have a weird hierarchy when it comes to animals and cause fish.

2123
02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:20.870
We don't think of necessarily a fish as animals.

2124
02:03:20.871 --> 02:03:25.871
The way we think of is like lamb or cow or Patrice O'Neal side.

2125
02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:26.970
They weren't what?

2126
02:03:26.970 --> 02:03:31.190
<v 1>They don't have eyebrows.
He said you can't see them look at you like,
oh,</v>

2127
02:03:31.191 --> 02:03:35.150
what the fuck are you?
That's so true.
That's really true.

2128
02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:38.450
<v 6>Well,
they're not.
You know,
they don't live in our world.
The thing about fish,</v>

2129
02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:42.740
they live in that weird world that we shared,
a wet world.

2130
02:03:46.090 --> 02:03:47.480
I mean,
if I'm going to eat anybody,

2131
02:03:47.530 --> 02:03:50.900
I'm going to eat some dude from another planet,
right?
If I'm going to eat,

2132
02:03:50.901 --> 02:03:52.580
a person becomes between eating.

2133
02:03:52.581 --> 02:03:55.640
Some guy lives down the street from me or eating some guy lives on Avatar.

2134
02:03:55.641 --> 02:03:57.530
I'm going to leave.
I'm going to eat the advocate.
What is this?

2135
02:03:57.790 --> 02:04:01.030
This is one of the machines.
There's a few different kinds of,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

2136
02:04:01.031 --> 02:04:05.150
no,
no.
Not Anymore.
The tree,
grabs a tree,
pulls it out of the ground,

2137
02:04:05.151 --> 02:04:07.820
cuts it in half.
It's true.
I mean all on the spot.

2138
02:04:07.821 --> 02:04:12.410
It's the most I've seen that were just,
yeah,
it's crazy.
It's,
it's almost unfair.

2139
02:04:12.620 --> 02:04:14.990
It's almost unfair how it does it,
but anyway,

2140
02:04:15.110 --> 02:04:19.490
the way we treat fish is so different than the way we treat any animal.

2141
02:04:19.610 --> 02:04:20.510
If we had,

2142
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:26.470
if there was a video of people taking cows in a net and just scooping them up

2143
02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:32.030
with like tanks,
they roll tanks across the field,
drag these nets,

2144
02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:37.070
scoop these cows up for hoist him up in the air,
suffocate him,

2145
02:04:37.290 --> 02:04:41.100
just suffocate him.
Did it mean we kill the fish?
They don't even kill tuna.

2146
02:04:41.370 --> 02:04:43.650
They just let him die.
They don't kill him.

2147
02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:46.440
They pull them out of the water and go,
yeah,
I guess that's it.

2148
02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:51.990
Maybe have a bullet in the brain.
Aw Man,
boats are expensive.

2149
02:04:53.460 --> 02:04:56.880
You got to suffocate.
Hey,
in a couple minutes we'll be dead as fuck.

2150
02:04:56.881 --> 02:05:00.900
So don't sweat it.
We just pull them out of the water.
Can you imagine if we just,

2151
02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:03.540
every time someone killed a cow that killed it with a pillow,

2152
02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:05.790
do you want how much people would freak out?

2153
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:10.990
<v 1>The visual of just dumping visually dumping cows onto the flat.</v>

2154
02:05:12.250 --> 02:05:16.430
Just like a big boat.
Oh Dude,
outrage.

2155
02:05:16.730 --> 02:05:19.820
Oh my God.
People would freak out if you had a boat,

2156
02:05:19.850 --> 02:05:22.910
but it was on tractor wheels and it was in the middle of a corn

2157
02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:27.900
<v 6>feeling when you're scooping cows up and dropping them on their fucking heads,</v>

2158
02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:31.260
people would freak out.
But the same people

2159
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:33.770
<v 1>I would say,
and we meet and he</v>

2160
02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:37.170
<v 6>animals but occasionally has see she,</v>

2161
02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:40.890
if my blood feels thin,

2162
02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:44.010
some Sushi cause they don't,

2163
02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:47.070
we don't think of fish as being the same as

2164
02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:49.860
<v 1>a deer.
A beautiful deer.
I've definitely,</v>

2165
02:05:49.950 --> 02:05:52.050
it's a thing you're talking about taking it first time hunters out.

2166
02:05:52.290 --> 02:05:55.620
I've definitely caught fish and kill fish and flood them and scale them.

2167
02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:59.160
You don't feel bad at all right now?
I have no remorse.
Uh,
however,

2168
02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:03.210
I was around someone when they killed a buffalo and it was weird.

2169
02:06:03.211 --> 02:06:04.790
Stark like I was like,
I don't know if I,

2170
02:06:04.890 --> 02:06:09.890
I don't know where whatever happened to the trees that were pulling you two

2171
02:06:10.171 --> 02:06:11.004
guys.
One fish.

2172
02:06:11.250 --> 02:06:14.600
<v 6>No,
I don't want to watch it and stop.
I want to see this.
Come on man.</v>

2173
02:06:15.050 --> 02:06:16.670
Don't take matters into your own hands.

2174
02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:21.710
The fucking video.
So we were just talking.

2175
02:06:21.711 --> 02:06:24.790
I love the way Brian's non sequitur brain words.
He goes two guys,
one vision.

2176
02:06:24.791 --> 02:06:27.410
Have you seen that?
Yeah.
There's nothing to do with where we're talking about.

2177
02:06:27.411 --> 02:06:31.010
And you know what's so funny is that there are things that we're trying to find

2178
02:06:31.011 --> 02:06:33.490
like a really profound video on the,

2179
02:06:33.491 --> 02:06:37.130
like the efficiency of these machines that are chopping down logs.
It's like,

2180
02:06:37.340 --> 02:06:40.100
it's almost like you're watching and going,
whoa,
whoa.
It's too fast.

2181
02:06:40.370 --> 02:06:44.420
It's supposed to be an ax.
It's supposed to take time.
This is a life form.

2182
02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:47.440
You don't respect it if forum feeling thousands of them.
Yeah,
yeah.

2183
02:06:47.450 --> 02:06:51.230
That's the machine.
Yeah.
I'll find that shit in a video.
It's a Gif.
Watch.

2184
02:06:51.231 --> 02:06:53.810
This dude is fucking crazy.
Look,

2185
02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:58.760
it cuts the machine or the machine cuts the log at this.
It's shrimps.

2186
02:06:58.761 --> 02:07:02.840
It and just start sewing it into fucking sections.
It's crazy.

2187
02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:07.580
It cuts it in.
Literally two seconds.
Lifts this giant tree in the air.

2188
02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:12.700
This tractor arms strips these logs of branches and then saws it into like 20

2189
02:07:13.281 --> 02:07:15.530
foot or 12 foot sections,
whatever the fuck they are.

2190
02:07:15.531 --> 02:07:19.690
Whatever the name of that machinist.
I've had that blowjob.
Wow.

2191
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:24.230
Just Tifi.
Just wrong.
You need to complain before it cuts your Dick off.

2192
02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:27.850
You need to complain like as it starts,
it's process of

2193
02:07:29.350 --> 02:07:31.120
<v 1>I'm not good [inaudible] my needs.</v>

2194
02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:36.490
If we did what we do to fish to any animal,
people would freak out.

2195
02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:40.300
We have a weird hierarchy.
We could probably do it to hamsters.

2196
02:07:40.690 --> 02:07:45.610
No.
People love mammals.
There's something weird,

2197
02:07:46.250 --> 02:07:49.300
but why can't we do it to dolphins then?
Is it cause they make noises.

2198
02:07:49.330 --> 02:07:53.400
They're smart,
but no,
no,
but is it really smart?
No,
no buddy.

2199
02:07:53.410 --> 02:07:54.880
Buddy knows the same.
Like,

2200
02:07:55.530 --> 02:08:00.490
like a shark dies on the deck of a boat.
Nolan.
They go,
you know?

2201
02:08:00.670 --> 02:08:04.450
Yeah.
We had to catch a big shark.
There was killing people.
Fish die.

2202
02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:07.420
But dolphins make noises and whales do too.

2203
02:08:07.421 --> 02:08:11.530
I wonder if that's why those are the two animals that society is a verse to

2204
02:08:11.531 --> 02:08:15.610
killing better in the water.
You know what I mean?
If will they're,

2205
02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:18.660
they're mammals were,
were averse to killing all the mammals.
Oh,

2206
02:08:18.661 --> 02:08:22.720
your first killing whales and Orcas and seals and sea lions.

2207
02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:25.000
Anything that's a mammal that breeds air.

2208
02:08:25.210 --> 02:08:27.340
We have an affinity to things that breathe.

2209
02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:29.650
The same shit that we've read were really weird.

2210
02:08:29.850 --> 02:08:33.370
Like things he could breathe underwater.
Like,
ah,
you bitches,
you and I even out

2211
02:08:35.650 --> 02:08:40.060
<v 5>freshmen.
I mean,
if,
what is the difference for you to fucking see a lot of tuna?</v>

2212
02:08:40.210 --> 02:08:44.740
Can someone tell me a seal smarter than they used tools.
They have language.

2213
02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:49.060
Did he use emojis?
They fucking have Facebook pages.
They're dirty.

2214
02:08:49.061 --> 02:08:52.120
Conti animals with goofy teeth.
Okay.

2215
02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:57.280
What's the difference between them and some Angler fish or a tuna or a halibut?

2216
02:08:57.430 --> 02:08:58.263
Nothing.

2217
02:08:58.550 --> 02:09:02.100
<v 1>Life forms that aren't people,
but when you beat them,
they cry.</v>

2218
02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:05.890
That's what it is to seals cry when you beat him.
I'm thinking of walruses.

2219
02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:09.320
No bs horses are inherently more country than seals because my teeth,

2220
02:09:09.590 --> 02:09:12.540
teeth privilege,
they have teeth privilege.

2221
02:09:12.570 --> 02:09:16.400
It's white privilege and it's long and it's hard.
It's both.
It's teeth,
white,

2222
02:09:16.401 --> 02:09:19.890
white teeth privilege,
which is worse than even regular white privilege.

2223
02:09:20.490 --> 02:09:22.730
I always see life could be like breathing.

2224
02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:24.810
You can't feel bad for things with fangs.

2225
02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:28.050
Can you imagine like all like all things like all fish and I'll see life could

2226
02:09:28.051 --> 02:09:31.440
breathe in space and then you could just hike half like fish swimming around.

2227
02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:35.560
Imagine fish could just pop out of the ocean.
Just shoot right up to them.

2228
02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:42.450
<v 5>You got it high enough it just went to the moon.
You're like</v>

2229
02:09:44.170 --> 02:09:49.170
all night long had a slingshot sufficiently powerful enough that can launch a

2230
02:09:49.691 --> 02:09:52.720
fucking big mouth bass.
What?
It was only like one,

2231
02:09:52.730 --> 02:09:55.110
it was only 35 feet and you just were sitting with your friends.
Like

2232
02:09:57.790 --> 02:10:00.660
we'd sort of take it for granted that the earth's atmosphere is what,

2233
02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:05.340
like 300 miles or something like that of air 300 miles up.

2234
02:10:05.341 --> 02:10:08.340
It's just fucking space,
right?
Like that's where the space station is.

2235
02:10:08.341 --> 02:10:12.750
It's all like 200 plus miles up.
But imagine if it wasn't 200 miles,

2236
02:10:12.751 --> 02:10:16.530
just a mile.
I'll go out.
You have to do is you get that fish a mile,

2237
02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:18.560
that'd be awesome.

2238
02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:24.680
Super slingshot that shoots fucking northern pike a mile into the sky.

2239
02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:28.900
And once you do,
they just swim around the earth.
Yeah,

2240
02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:31.660
<v 1>and then they just swim in space like there were travelers.
I,</v>

2241
02:10:31.661 --> 02:10:33.980
you'll see dolphins swimming the hours.
The best

2242
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.980
<v 6>part of that is like after you slid it up that 13 seconds later we were like,</v>

2243
02:10:36.981 --> 02:10:37.814
is it gonna hit the ground?

2244
02:10:38.570 --> 02:10:42.440
You can have an APP that would trace the fish that you put the little badge on.

2245
02:10:43.610 --> 02:10:48.230
Put a drop cam on your fish.
You could track your fish.

2246
02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:52.700
You can check your fucking stupid slingshot fishing flies around the earth.

2247
02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:54.650
And imagine if things didn't starve to death.

2248
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:59.150
If they could just live off space air.
Why not?
Why do you have to eat things?

2249
02:10:59.180 --> 02:11:02.780
Who said it says,
how come fucking plants aren't eaten?
Shit.

2250
02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:04.670
They're just sucking things out of the dirt.

2251
02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:07.220
How about you learning to suck shit at a space?
Stupid.

2252
02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:13.790
Your mouth stretches out and you become just like a big micro meatier suction

2253
02:11:13.791 --> 02:11:18.260
cup.
Just sucking and fucking space.
Dust and radiation.

2254
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:21.020
You live off radiation.
We were like a caterpillar.

2255
02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:24.260
We need just start a Kickstarter for this.
Yeah,
you would change.

2256
02:11:24.261 --> 02:11:27.470
You Morph once you go into space.
Imagine if we found that out,

2257
02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:29.450
that people go into space that we can live,

2258
02:11:29.451 --> 02:11:30.920
but we've become a totally different thing.

2259
02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:36.640
We become some weird micro media or a micro media rather.

2260
02:11:36.861 --> 02:11:40.580
A Suction Cup were just up there floating around like a jellyfish.

2261
02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:44.810
It'll be universe sucking particles and radiation out of Scott.

2262
02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:48.380
Pitch it to me though,
like this is what it is.
You think it caterpillar,

2263
02:11:48.381 --> 02:11:51.950
when a caterpillar is live and it's funky ass caterpillar live [inaudible]

2264
02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:56.120
leaves and shit.
Do you think those motherfuckers know one day that'd be flying?

2265
02:11:56.450 --> 02:12:01.010
If they did,
they'd be like,
can I apply now?
What am I now?
What about now?
No,

2266
02:12:01.011 --> 02:12:02.810
you don't ever get to talk to them.
To stupid.

2267
02:12:02.811 --> 02:12:04.920
Caterpillar is just keep eating your leaves like your,

2268
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.830
your genes dictate and one day you'll huddle up in a little cocoon and pop out

2269
02:12:10.010 --> 02:12:14.120
of magnificent floating literally a ferry.
I mean,

2270
02:12:14.121 --> 02:12:17.390
what's the difference between a ferry and a butterfly?
Fairies are stupid.

2271
02:12:17.570 --> 02:12:20.510
That's the difference.
Butterfly.
You can see what happens.

2272
02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:23.840
Ferries aren't even makes sense.
W do they die?
Why they die?

2273
02:12:23.841 --> 02:12:26.300
Their magic can't figure out a way to make them live forever.

2274
02:12:26.850 --> 02:12:28.900
How did the ferries fuck with new ferries?

2275
02:12:28.910 --> 02:12:33.110
Come from fairies come with too many problems.
Okay,
but butterflies,

2276
02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:38.240
even in the gestation process and the process of becoming a butterfly from being

2277
02:12:38.241 --> 02:12:40.010
caterpillar,
it's nothing but beautiful.

2278
02:12:40.011 --> 02:12:44.900
Nature is nothing but cocoons and and breaking free and the moment,

2279
02:12:44.901 --> 02:12:45.710
the first,

2280
02:12:45.710 --> 02:12:50.540
the first wings flutter and then launching itself instinctively into the and

2281
02:12:50.541 --> 02:12:52.100
just flying around as a butterfly,

2282
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:55.880
knowing what does it have like four or five days until it dies of old age.

2283
02:12:56.180 --> 02:13:00.410
If it's lucky,
who knows?
What does a butterfly lived to be a month,

2284
02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:04.280
but differences in Maine four days,
20 days,
it's not a year.

2285
02:13:04.281 --> 02:13:08.090
They don't live that long.
They die quick as fuck.
They don't even care.

2286
02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:12.800
They just just followed through with that process and the reward is literally

2287
02:13:12.801 --> 02:13:17.801
being able to negotiate until through three d space and this exuberant sort of

2288
02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:24.260
orgasm orgasmic way that you'll never experience as a fucking lowly human being.

2289
02:13:24.261 --> 02:13:27.950
With bones and flesh.
They just fly,

2290
02:13:28.190 --> 02:13:32.040
fly from plant to plant,
sucking nectar out.
Would you trade

2291
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:35.970
<v 1>it?
Nope.
Nope.
Hold on.
Here were the pitch at all.</v>

2292
02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:37.140
I'll tell you right now.

2293
02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:42.200
What about you get 40 years of your life in the last 30 you are technically the

2294
02:13:44.161 --> 02:13:47.230
human version of the butterfly.
You can fly you,
you,

2295
02:13:47.231 --> 02:13:48.870
you feel a hundred percent perfect.

2296
02:13:49.290 --> 02:13:54.270
You can dive into water and Doug does the deeper your magical for 30 years.

2297
02:13:54.530 --> 02:13:57.990
So the keep waiting for him but you got to do some gay shit.

2298
02:13:59.370 --> 02:13:59.610
<v 5>It is.</v>

2299
02:13:59.610 --> 02:14:04.470
That's where it like whenever but you to have to be a fairy decks like the whole

2300
02:14:04.471 --> 02:14:06.240
time.
No,
but like would you trade,

2301
02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:08.760
you can only breathe through Dick's three quarters of your life.

2302
02:14:13.770 --> 02:14:16.350
You don't necessarily have to stop death,

2303
02:14:17.010 --> 02:14:21.990
but you got to breathe through Dick's.
Are you in terror through us?
I'm like,

2304
02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:26.670
well you tearing through space.
You got to find decks in space.

2305
02:14:27.020 --> 02:14:31.530
They contain oxygen.
That's what it just big,
giant,

2306
02:14:31.531 --> 02:14:33.300
juicy Dixon are attached to clouds.

2307
02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:41.510
Oh good Lord.
Blocking me.

2308
02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:44.600
Oh someone make a Gif of that big clouds.

2309
02:14:44.610 --> 02:14:46.680
Big giant takes a test to clouds.

2310
02:14:47.130 --> 02:14:51.990
You're sucking on the fucking station to station as you float through heaven.

2311
02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:57.770
<v 1>I'm sure there's people out there offended right now.
I don't.</v>

2312
02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:01.520
I think there are people a lot.
I'm with you.
I'm with you.

2313
02:15:02.630 --> 02:15:06.050
Whatever's happened on the show burden.
I didn't plan it.
Nope.

2314
02:15:06.290 --> 02:15:10.660
We're not happy about it.
It's not what we expected.
Ooh.

2315
02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:18.180
<v 5>We were hoping for some stories about Vietnam.
I called Bert up the other day.</v>

2316
02:15:18.210 --> 02:15:22.250
This is how rare bird crisis.
What are you doing man?
Ride motorcycles.
A Vietnam.

2317
02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:26.340
There's not a single person I know where I can call them up in the middle of the

2318
02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:30.630
day.
I go,
what's up,
dude?
What are you doing man?
Oh,
riding motorcycles.
Vietnam

2319
02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:35.880
was the fuck says that Bert Kreischer.
Every time I called Bert,
Oh,

2320
02:15:35.881 --> 02:15:39.630
I'm on a roller coaster in Angola.
I'm on top of a mountain on a zip

2321
02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:41.460
<v 8>one.
Woo.</v>

2322
02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:44.720
<v 5>Felt like Mr</v>

2323
02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:49.393
Mr. Bird.

2324
02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:50.860
<v 8>Woo.</v>

2325
02:15:51.150 --> 02:15:53.590
<v 5>That is a real conversation.
Is it not?
I called you up.</v>

2326
02:15:53.591 --> 02:15:55.360
You said you're riding motorcycles and Vietnam.

2327
02:15:55.460 --> 02:15:58.550
<v 1>It was very real.
It was very real.
There was a,
yeah,
it was.</v>

2328
02:15:58.850 --> 02:16:02.990
I listed off like nine different things I'd done with last week and you were

2329
02:16:02.991 --> 02:16:07.150
like,
what the fuck the fuck you kept going.
I keep,

2330
02:16:07.151 --> 02:16:10.830
forget the word you used them,
but I loved it.
You were like,
Ah,
you're a madman.

2331
02:16:10.850 --> 02:16:14.890
You're a,
you're a madman,
you're a madman.
You live in the life of a man,
man.

2332
02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:16.100
You're out there fucking

2333
02:16:16.580 --> 02:16:21.580
<v 5>going to different countries almost every month experiencing some wild,</v>

2334
02:16:22.521 --> 02:16:26.530
crazy shit,
dude.
You're jumping on a fucking planes and you're on.

2335
02:16:26.570 --> 02:16:30.190
There's animals involved and your behavior.
There's a lot of shit going

2336
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:33.670
<v 3>down,
dude.
You're doing a lot of crazy trips.
It's been scuba diving.</v>

2337
02:16:34.020 --> 02:16:37.160
<v 1>Scuba diving was the one that fucked me up the most deep.
Did you go red crusher?</v>

2338
02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:41.970
What the Fuck Bert Kreischer.
That's a big space.
There was a wreck down there.

2339
02:16:43.260 --> 02:16:47.370
A boat,
very similar to the one that I got off on.
There was a fucking boat.

2340
02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:49.590
That's a fucking daunting thought.

2341
02:16:49.970 --> 02:16:53.730
You're getting off a boat looking at a boat that failed,
gone up

2342
02:16:55.450 --> 02:16:59.640
every,
the last time I saw this,
it was all panic like that.

2343
02:16:59.641 --> 02:17:03.020
This isn't boats last moment.
This is she,
I'm going to a fucking wreck.

2344
02:17:03.030 --> 02:17:06.780
Won't a place of terror.
It's like visiting a crime scene.
Where was this again?

2345
02:17:06.830 --> 02:17:10.800
A Fiji.
Fiji and they bring us out.
Horrible weather.

2346
02:17:10.830 --> 02:17:14.700
Well you're the boat crash.
Uh,
forties I think everything in around Fiji.
Christ,

2347
02:17:16.590 --> 02:17:20.640
everything has to do with World War II.
Wow.
So,
uh,
so yeah,

2348
02:17:20.641 --> 02:17:25.641
we dates stormy weather's six foot seas and we get in the water and it's,

2349
02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:31.740
I would say like if you,
if you think you'd love scuba diving,

2350
02:17:31.770 --> 02:17:35.280
you'd love scuba diving,
but if you think you may not enjoy it,

2351
02:17:35.430 --> 02:17:39.450
you'll fucking hate it.
Like it is not one of those for the faint of heart.

2352
02:17:40.020 --> 02:17:44.640
<v 3>Yeah.
But you are a guy.
This is,
this is a fascinating thing about your man.</v>

2353
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:48.570
You're a guy who's had your anxiety issues.
You've talked about it,

2354
02:17:48.571 --> 02:17:51.010
this Bert Kreischer lean and mean looking sexy as

2355
02:17:53.050 --> 02:17:54.820
<v 9>the hair loss,</v>

2356
02:17:56.470 --> 02:18:00.280
<v 3>but yet you do a lot of like really crazy shit.</v>

2357
02:18:00.310 --> 02:18:05.310
You'd do a lot of like wild trips with these people to show triplet brings you

2358
02:18:05.501 --> 02:18:06.820
all over the world.
Like you're doing.

2359
02:18:06.821 --> 02:18:10.930
Like some things that you would think that someone who would have anxiety or,

2360
02:18:10.990 --> 02:18:15.340
or who would think about all the variables in life and kind of panic a little

2361
02:18:15.341 --> 02:18:18.970
bit.
You wouldn't be drawn to this,
but you,
you excel at this so you're,

2362
02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.140
you're in a lot of ways.
You're a,
you're a contradiction,
Matt.
Your contradiction.

2363
02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:27.030
Yeah.
I don't know.
I can't figure it out.
I wish I can figure you out in a way.
Oh,

2364
02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:29.980
okay.
I'm going to tell you something about you.
Okay.

2365
02:18:29.981 --> 02:18:33.760
You're this like really happy go lucky guy,
but you're also very combative.

2366
02:18:34.690 --> 02:18:37.460
I saw you play pool when you play pool.
You wanted to wait.

2367
02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:43.680
You wanted to win right now?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,

2368
02:18:43.690 --> 02:18:46.990
no.
Little bit of bird is bullshit.

2369
02:18:47.290 --> 02:18:51.400
A little bit of bird is bullshit.
You're,
you're being kind.
You're being kind.

2370
02:18:51.401 --> 02:18:55.360
You're a sweetheart of a guy,
but you're like,
Hey,
who cares who wins?

2371
02:18:55.361 --> 02:18:59.290
You want to fucking win,
dude.
Right.
Am I right?

2372
02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:03.010
<v 1>I noticed it.
No,
there's not.
There's not like a,</v>

2373
02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:05.330
<v 3>there's a fire in your eyes.
I was like,
Ooh.</v>

2374
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:10.430
<v 1>I have the thing,
the same thing you have where I go,
I don't know.
I don't know.</v>

2375
02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:11.570
This is a horrible time.

2376
02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:16.800
<v 3>No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It was a horrible,
listen,</v>

2377
02:19:16.801 --> 02:19:19.440
I'll give you,
I'll give you way better.
I'll give you way better.

2378
02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:24.090
I had a really hard time liking people if I lost them in anything until it was

2379
02:19:24.091 --> 02:19:28.130
almost 30 I really had a hard,
I,
I didn't like

2380
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:32.210
<v 6>people.
If I lost them,
I didn't like them.
Like I couldn't be your friend.</v>

2381
02:19:32.211 --> 02:19:35.780
Like if we played chess and you,
you beat me in chess.
I wanted to kill you.

2382
02:19:36.170 --> 02:19:38.540
It's retarded.
It's so like,

2383
02:19:38.810 --> 02:19:43.810
it's so dopey and it's like such a really bad way of managing thoughts.

2384
02:19:45.050 --> 02:19:48.930
So I connect with that.
All I'm saying is you wanted to win a game of pool.

2385
02:19:49.170 --> 02:19:53.010
<v 2>Weird way.
Cause I can I tell you what I did.
By the way.
This is way,</v>

2386
02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:57.420
this is way not how bad you want to win that game.

2387
02:19:57.421 --> 02:20:01.560
Bert Kreischer I am afraid that I,

2388
02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:04.060
<v 6>are you afraid of your Father Bert?
Why?</v>

2389
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:06.240
What about the time he pissed on the table?

2390
02:20:08.460 --> 02:20:10.410
The father in law's table.
He's pissing,

2391
02:20:15.100 --> 02:20:15.933
<v 2>you're afraid.</v>

2392
02:20:17.500 --> 02:20:21.560
<v 6>Come on man.
You wanted to win that game,
dude.
I know one dudes want to win.</v>

2393
02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:26.060
I like,
Ooh,
smelled hot in here.
I do.

2394
02:20:26.061 --> 02:20:30.470
This is a horrible conversation.
Good conversation.
Drop it.
Oh No,
no,
no,
no.

2395
02:20:30.471 --> 02:20:33.920
Listen,
you're a beautiful human being.
I'm not calling you out.
Know what I'm,

2396
02:20:33.921 --> 02:20:36.650
what I'm saying is when I say a little bit of birds bullshit,

2397
02:20:36.651 --> 02:20:40.610
it's like there's a reason why you're such a funny guy.

2398
02:20:40.611 --> 02:20:43.730
He's a reason why you're such a,
a good comic.

2399
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:47.480
And one of the reasons why is because you're sold likable.
You know,
you'll like,

2400
02:20:47.481 --> 02:20:51.500
so ingratiating,
you're such a good guy,
but you're not a pushover.

2401
02:20:51.770 --> 02:20:54.140
Like there's a reason why you're successful too,
is like,

2402
02:20:54.141 --> 02:20:56.180
you know when to be nice and when did we not nice.

2403
02:20:56.570 --> 02:21:00.800
And when you engage you in a little game,
that's when you get to see,
oh,

2404
02:21:00.801 --> 02:21:03.290
there's a fire under the hood of Bert Kreischer.

2405
02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:07.820
We played one game of paying.
No,
that's what's so exciting about it.

2406
02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:11.760
<v 2>I,
I have empathized with,
like,</v>

2407
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:17.520
I'm going to say this,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm just be honest,

2408
02:21:17.580 --> 02:21:20.420
I empathize with guys like Todd glass where I feel like sometimes I hear him on

2409
02:21:20.421 --> 02:21:23.190
podcasts and he is the butt of every joke.

2410
02:21:23.430 --> 02:21:28.430
And I always constantly know that Todd isn't that he's a super talented dude

2411
02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:31.770
who's amazing on and off with the nice guys in the world.

2412
02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:34.540
I think my fear at of,

2413
02:21:34.660 --> 02:21:38.880
at in college was I wasn't this dude who like,

2414
02:21:38.881 --> 02:21:43.560
I'm not that guy that's like two girls,
one chick.
Fuck yeah,
that's not me.

2415
02:21:43.970 --> 02:21:47.640
But I also felt like that took something away.
Girls.
One check is three girls.

2416
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:51.930
Yeah.
One of them.
I already talked to you about the thing,
two guys and a check.

2417
02:21:52.290 --> 02:21:54.240
But that's not me.
I can't do that.
I'm not,

2418
02:21:54.241 --> 02:21:58.710
I've never been had that are not in my DNA and I,
but I've,
I've always felt like,

2419
02:21:58.711 --> 02:22:03.090
uh,
like I do there.
If you're not competitive,

2420
02:22:03.091 --> 02:22:07.140
you're not male.
And,
and I,
I never want people to think I'm a really nice guy,

2421
02:22:07.141 --> 02:22:10.260
but I never want to think about pushover that you could steal from.
Yeah.

2422
02:22:10.290 --> 02:22:14.640
But sadly and and way too fucked up to have this conversation.

2423
02:22:14.910 --> 02:22:18.030
I feel like that I am that guy that I've been so nice that I've been taken

2424
02:22:18.031 --> 02:22:18.770
advantage of.

2425
02:22:18.770 --> 02:22:20.930
<v 6>But you have,
and I know you have,
cause we've,</v>

2426
02:22:20.931 --> 02:22:24.350
we've talked about people that you are friends with or you've had bad

2427
02:22:24.351 --> 02:22:25.740
experiences with and

2428
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:28.740
<v 3>you know,
I,</v>

2429
02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:31.560
I don't think there's anything wrong with being competitive I think,

2430
02:22:31.561 --> 02:22:32.520
and not only that,

2431
02:22:32.521 --> 02:22:35.970
I think being competitive as good for everybody around you because I think that

2432
02:22:35.971 --> 02:22:39.330
especially if you're competitive,
like with a a game or something like that,

2433
02:22:39.331 --> 02:22:41.580
you're trying to get better at the game and another guy was trying to get better

2434
02:22:41.581 --> 02:22:43.990
at the game.
When you start doing that,
it,

2435
02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:46.950
it fires up your intensity level.

2436
02:22:46.951 --> 02:22:49.410
Like it doesn't necessarily have to be a negative thing,
right?

2437
02:22:49.590 --> 02:22:53.130
We Associated William negative thing.
If you fall short,
if you fall short,

2438
02:22:53.131 --> 02:22:55.710
you assume you'll want to blame it on the other person instead of blaming it on

2439
02:22:55.711 --> 02:22:56.340
yourself.

2440
02:22:56.340 --> 02:22:59.850
But if like we play pool and I miss a shot and you run eight balls and you sink

2441
02:22:59.851 --> 02:23:03.990
the nine ball and you win,
that is not,
if not all I did was fuck up,

2442
02:23:03.991 --> 02:23:07.200
you did amazing shit.
I should be psyched.
Like you should be psyched.

2443
02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:09.600
And she'd be like,
wow man,
I got to step it up.

2444
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:13.790
But some guys like this mother Fucker,
you feel it and it's,

2445
02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:16.530
it's literally thought management thing.

2446
02:23:16.890 --> 02:23:19.320
I know people who look at life that way

2447
02:23:19.470 --> 02:23:24.470
<v 2>and this is this like the a little bit of a shot back and they start barking and</v>

2448
02:23:24.911 --> 02:23:26.950
they think their bark is important and,

2449
02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:30.850
<v 3>and we both been guilty.
Everyone in this room's Miguel to do that,
right?
Yes.</v>

2450
02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:34.630
Right.
100% that's a,
that's,
that's a natural human behavior.

2451
02:23:34.631 --> 02:23:37.650
Especially when you're young.
And some guys even,
you know,

2452
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:40.900
it's like 10 years is not as much time as you think it is.

2453
02:23:40.901 --> 02:23:45.010
Everybody wants to think it's a long time.
And it can be if you're in jail,

2454
02:23:45.310 --> 02:23:49.090
if you're in a bad job or a shit relationship,
10 years can take a long time.

2455
02:23:49.480 --> 02:23:51.430
But it also can be incredibly quick.

2456
02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:56.080
And what you learned in a 10 year span is like,
you know,
it's not that much.

2457
02:23:56.081 --> 02:23:58.810
Sometimes some,
some people,
you know,
especially when you're busy,

2458
02:23:58.811 --> 02:24:01.870
you don't really don't really grow that much in 10 fucking years.

2459
02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:03.970
<v 2>True.
There's the,
the,</v>

2460
02:24:04.020 --> 02:24:08.160
the capacity you have not to grow in a three year period is shocking.

2461
02:24:08.190 --> 02:24:09.210
Especially if you're busy.

2462
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:10.380
<v 3>If you're busy,</v>

2463
02:24:10.380 --> 02:24:13.770
especially if you're busy doing some shit you don't necessarily want to do,

2464
02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:16.793
but there's nothing bro.

2465
02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:19.800
Point being there's nothing wrong with being competitive.
Well,
the,

2466
02:24:19.801 --> 02:24:23.160
the real problem is getting upset at people who are better than you and shit.

2467
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:24.120
You should be happy.

2468
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:27.480
<v 2>That's me.
I celebrate everyone.
But there is a competitive bone in my,</v>

2469
02:24:27.481 --> 02:24:31.120
but like I say,
Bill Burke told a joke on,
um,

2470
02:24:31.290 --> 02:24:35.490
Conan about cancer that was really out there.

2471
02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:38.670
Was it turning the Lance Armstrong rat was talking about,
no,
it's,
I'm trying to,

2472
02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:42.780
having ball cancer.
No,
it was,
it was an bill.
I'm sure I'm fucking this up,

2473
02:24:42.781 --> 02:24:45.180
but I appreciate the joke is that,
uh,

2474
02:24:45.181 --> 02:24:48.060
the fact that the NFL is now going to take over cancer in the middle of the
game,

2475
02:24:48.061 --> 02:24:51.810
they shut it down and then they stop for a moment,
sounds for cancer,

2476
02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:54.720
and then they start the game back up and I'm supposed to be there and he goes,

2477
02:24:54.750 --> 02:24:57.480
I would never do that in a fucking living room.
My buddy,
like,

2478
02:24:57.481 --> 02:24:58.291
stop the movie and Go,
Hey,

2479
02:24:58.291 --> 02:25:00.990
my dad died of pancreatic and let's start it back up again.

2480
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:05.040
Now I'll tell you this,
it's a great fucking,

2481
02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:07.860
it's something that I've seen a ton of and thought a ton of,

2482
02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:11.310
but I haven't thought of.
Now my competitiveness is not what bill burr.

2483
02:25:11.740 --> 02:25:14.100
I respect Wilbur beyond a doubt.

2484
02:25:14.130 --> 02:25:16.950
I would just wish you had thought you had already thought of the idea.

2485
02:25:16.951 --> 02:25:19.830
You just never did anything with it.
And that doesn't go look at,

2486
02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:24.080
this is gonna sound clunky,
but that doesn't go away.
The more

2487
02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:27.420
<v 1>manual I will always respect my friends.
And,
and,
and,</v>

2488
02:25:27.430 --> 02:25:30.730
and I say some guys that I don't talk to that much,
but Daniel Tosh,

2489
02:25:30.731 --> 02:25:35.380
I will always respect the way he writes jokes.
Also in my head,

2490
02:25:36.030 --> 02:25:38.690
I'm concerned that my joke writing it is,

2491
02:25:38.770 --> 02:25:43.180
isn't a par with his or that my work ethic and that's where I fail.

2492
02:25:43.390 --> 02:25:48.220
My work ethic isn't to part with his arm.
I was stand up,
his work ethic is,

2493
02:25:49.090 --> 02:25:52.240
is beyond mine,
but our party levels at par.

2494
02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:56.860
And so I definitely look at Doug's like an inspiration.
I go,
I go,

2495
02:25:56.980 --> 02:26:01.450
how do I get to where Doug's that to where I'm partying like really hard but

2496
02:26:01.451 --> 02:26:04.660
writing but still writing.
I mean I just,
I feel like,

2497
02:26:04.661 --> 02:26:07.230
I feel like I'm going to sabbatical with this trip flip.
And,

2498
02:26:07.250 --> 02:26:09.490
and you said this to me the other day and now I'm hammered.

2499
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:12.610
You said this to me of the day you go,
uh,
I said,
yeah,

2500
02:26:12.611 --> 02:26:16.990
I drink a bottle of champagne.
You said if you,
I just grabbed the glass.

2501
02:26:16.991 --> 02:26:18.460
It wasn't there.
You said,

2502
02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:22.180
are you writing about this shit that you're doing?

2503
02:26:22.181 --> 02:26:26.860
Cause I told him a few things I did and I was like,
ah,
you got to write about it.

2504
02:26:26.861 --> 02:26:30.010
You should be talking about it on stage.
You're,
your act would be so unique.

2505
02:26:30.410 --> 02:26:34.830
I who the fuck is going to talk about riding motorcycles to Vietnam or Jamie?

2506
02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:36.550
Show him the,
the,

2507
02:26:37.390 --> 02:26:42.220
any show him the rope swing I did in Utah in Moab.

2508
02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.640
I mean,
I like,
are we saying this in air quotes or is it a real,

2509
02:26:45.641 --> 02:26:48.340
I was feeling the lava lamp.
I was filling the lava lamp.

2510
02:26:48.341 --> 02:26:52.990
But if you're going to the rope swing,
no,
you hanging onto it.

2511
02:26:52.990 --> 02:26:55.180
Can I tell you what I thought?
I thought I have superhuman powers.

2512
02:26:55.181 --> 02:26:58.130
Then I could feel the lava lamp from far away and I was like,
mm.

2513
02:26:58.390 --> 02:27:00.340
Probably going to do it just turns out it's hot.

2514
02:27:02.060 --> 02:27:06.670
Well that's super human powers.
Fucking that's it.
Not that Straw.

2515
02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:11.380
I love the slightly superhuman,
this part of your life.
Every part.
This is,

2516
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:16.330
we did this.
Whoa,
what is this?
This guy's bring,
uh,

2517
02:27:17.950 --> 02:27:20.650
he's young.
Go back.
Go back to young.

2518
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:26.680
Is there we're not supposed to no,
no,
no.
This is what we did with this.

2519
02:27:26.681 --> 02:27:29.110
Will this get us pulled from youtube?
Is that why you guys doing this?

2520
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:32.470
But maybe then what are you doing?
You're on like a rope.

2521
02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:36.550
It's a Kenyon swing.
Oh my God.
That's the corona arts.

2522
02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:40.090
You're swinging off of like a bungee cord or some shit.
It's a rope.

2523
02:27:40.091 --> 02:27:44.140
It's a climbing rope to climb on roofs.
Fog.
Zach Christ.
Yeah,
Bert Kreischer.

2524
02:27:44.170 --> 02:27:47.440
Why I scare people like this?
I don't,
you know,

2525
02:27:47.441 --> 02:27:50.590
my breaks and you go flying through the air if it breaks,
you know,

2526
02:27:50.591 --> 02:27:53.470
they tell you not to wear helmets.
They're like,
you don't want what happened.
Oh,

2527
02:27:53.471 --> 02:27:57.660
you're right.
You just want to die.
Just die.
This guy,
Devin supertramp,

2528
02:27:57.661 --> 02:28:01.960
it really is fantastic fast.
He gone when the slope at least 80 miles an hour.

2529
02:28:02.310 --> 02:28:06.910
I mean,
he's this Christ dude.
Oh my God.
But yeah,

2530
02:28:06.911 --> 02:28:07.990
this,
uh,
this,

2531
02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:12.460
this whole whole season has been really insane shit like this where you just are

2532
02:28:12.461 --> 02:28:16.960
like,
fuck that.
Yeah,

2533
02:28:16.961 --> 02:28:21.100
your skydive and you're doing all kinds of nutty shit,
man.
But you get in touch.

2534
02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:25.330
The inner paranoia.
Do you get in touch with the,

2535
02:28:25.460 --> 02:28:29.480
I wish I didn't feminize this,
but the little bitch in your heart that goes,

2536
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:33.050
that goes,
hey man,
what are we doing?
And you're like,

2537
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:35.750
Oh hell fucking know the little bitch in your heart.

2538
02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:37.790
Like that should be the title of your next special.

2539
02:28:40.430 --> 02:28:41.320
You should do this.

2540
02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:46.840
You should do your next special all on these crazy vacations and then call your

2541
02:28:47.751 --> 02:28:48.321
next special,

2542
02:28:48.321 --> 02:28:51.320
the little bitch and your heart and just talk about the terror that you

2543
02:28:51.321 --> 02:28:55.640
experienced on a semi weekly basis.
But it's what's going on here.
Bert Kreischer.

2544
02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:58.910
Oh,
this is a,
we did this,
it's called the terror of death.
It was on,

2545
02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:00.890
it aired last week.
The chair of death.

2546
02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:04.670
It's a 420 foot free fall,

2547
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:09.260
a rope swing in the Zealand.
Rope swings are the best band.

2548
02:29:09.261 --> 02:29:12.590
If I could open up a rope swing company,
and if you're out there in any,

2549
02:29:12.591 --> 02:29:15.620
you guys are listening,
you're,
I know how great this,
this,

2550
02:29:15.950 --> 02:29:17.210
the reach of the show works.

2551
02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:21.140
I want to get into rope swings like they're fucking next level.

2552
02:29:21.141 --> 02:29:24.280
There's so much more fun than Bungee.
So much more safer than unattached.

2553
02:29:24.470 --> 02:29:27.950
All worried about them breaking.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Trust your equipment.
Nope.

2554
02:29:28.060 --> 02:29:30.410
I don't worry.
I don't worry.
Cause if you start worrying Joe,

2555
02:29:30.650 --> 02:29:34.850
you're up at 2:00 AM and fucking New Zealand spiraling out in the shower

2556
02:29:34.851 --> 02:29:39.600
thinking I got bigger things than this.
Yeah,
it's deep.
That is.
It is.

2557
02:29:40.390 --> 02:29:44.480
So what happens here that you on slide back explained this to the people who are

2558
02:29:44.481 --> 02:29:47.210
just audio,
which is like,
so it's a percent of the people.

2559
02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:51.260
It is literally a diving board.
490 feet above.
So you're sitting,

2560
02:29:51.261 --> 02:29:55.880
this woman is sitting in a chair with her back to the edge of this platform that

2561
02:29:55.881 --> 02:29:58.730
is Manny hundreds of feet over the ground.

2562
02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:02.690
Imagine sitting on the back of a diving board at at 500 feet over the ground.

2563
02:30:02.720 --> 02:30:05.600
Right?
And you are pushing your own chair backwards,

2564
02:30:05.601 --> 02:30:09.950
like you're in your office and your casual relaxing until you go over too far.

2565
02:30:10.130 --> 02:30:13.580
And then what these guys are doing on the ledge is that stopper.

2566
02:30:13.730 --> 02:30:15.320
They stopped for about nine times.

2567
02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:19.100
So she feels like she may fall next stopper and then they bring her back and go,

2568
02:30:19.101 --> 02:30:23.510
hey,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
What are you doing it?
So how far does she fall?

2569
02:30:23.690 --> 02:30:26.840
Uh,
the,
the stats are on there.
Um,

2570
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:29.870
I think it's four 2,420 feet.
Yeah.

2571
02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:36.950
What the fuck it is hindering 20 theme free.

2572
02:30:37.010 --> 02:30:41.780
I'll be real honest.
Freefall at four 20 is a moment when you're done.

2573
02:30:41.781 --> 02:30:43.910
We were like,
I mean they're dead and in heaven or,

2574
02:30:43.911 --> 02:30:46.850
that was the greatest thing I ever fucking did in my life.
Oh my God.

2575
02:30:47.090 --> 02:30:50.990
Let me do it with you.
I did the show.

2576
02:30:50.991 --> 02:30:53.660
We shot clay pigeons with you.

2577
02:30:53.661 --> 02:30:58.200
No worry whatsoever about the repercussions.
I'll tell you why.

2578
02:30:58.670 --> 02:31:03.380
Some shotguns at some pellets or some,
uh,
disks.
I was really fun.
Was Fun,
man.

2579
02:31:04.190 --> 02:31:08.210
Shotgunning um,
like shooting shotguns at disks is really fun.

2580
02:31:08.570 --> 02:31:11.570
It's really hard to judge.
Like if you never shot a shotgun before,

2581
02:31:11.790 --> 02:31:16.490
I might've shot a shotgun like maybe once or twice ever before I did that.

2582
02:31:17.210 --> 02:31:20.010
And so doing it was really,
it was interesting.

2583
02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:24.410
<v 3>It's like the like you think about those people that like the the people that</v>

2584
02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:26.760
were shooting guns like way back in the day,

2585
02:31:26.761 --> 02:31:30.210
there's sites where so like archaic.

2586
02:31:30.211 --> 02:31:34.380
The idea was just like there was like a point that you had a lineup with an this

2587
02:31:34.381 --> 02:31:38.700
thing at the end and that's how you like looked and he tried to figure out and

2588
02:31:38.701 --> 02:31:40.290
you had to shoot a lot of shots.

2589
02:31:40.470 --> 02:31:45.470
Now you get these goddamn super powerful optics and you just get that cross here

2590
02:31:45.751 --> 02:31:49.320
on it.
As long as you don't flinch,
just pull and squeeze the trigger.
Boom.

2591
02:31:49.740 --> 02:31:53.280
Most of them are pretty God damn accurate but like shotguns,

2592
02:31:53.281 --> 02:31:56.250
like shotguns is just down the barrel.
Things are flying,

2593
02:31:56.251 --> 02:31:59.970
things are moving and the shotgun doesn't shoot as fast as a bullet.

2594
02:32:00.220 --> 02:32:03.690
It's not like you can just hold it in place and like it has like a slightly

2595
02:32:03.691 --> 02:32:06.720
slower projectile it up in front.

2596
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:12.000
You kind of kind of anticipate where the bird is going to be or the clay pigeon

2597
02:32:12.001 --> 02:32:15.630
is going to be when the shells or when the pellet's rather in the air,

2598
02:32:15.810 --> 02:32:18.600
so you have to almost lead it.
It's a really interesting,
it's fun.

2599
02:32:19.120 --> 02:32:21.760
<v 2>It's a,
it's,
it's what I respect in bow hunting.</v>

2600
02:32:21.761 --> 02:32:26.500
My Buddy Russell Matthews when we grew up was a big time bow hunter compound bow

2601
02:32:26.501 --> 02:32:30.400
has him and his dad went every weekend and that's the only person that I've ever

2602
02:32:30.401 --> 02:32:34.180
shot compound bows with.
But uh,
but the,
the,
the

2603
02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:38.500
artistry of bow hunting that you,

2604
02:32:38.501 --> 02:32:41.700
you need one area and it's to hit it in and it's,

2605
02:32:41.730 --> 02:32:43.150
it's fucking heat at the moment.

2606
02:32:43.151 --> 02:32:45.670
It's very different than pulling a gun up and just pull the trigger.

2607
02:32:46.310 --> 02:32:49.750
<v 1>It's,
it's definitely your cell phone out,
your wallet,
your keys.</v>

2608
02:32:49.780 --> 02:32:52.840
It's like getting your shit together.
They're arguing against it though,

2609
02:32:53.140 --> 02:32:55.180
is that if you don't know what you're doing,

2610
02:32:55.181 --> 02:32:57.910
you're more likely to wound an animal.
Which I really agree with that.

2611
02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:00.210
<v 3>I agree with that.
It is,
I mean it's,
it's legit.</v>

2612
02:33:00.480 --> 02:33:04.500
Like I think you have a bigger responsibility if you want to try bow hunting

2613
02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:06.300
then you do.
If you want to try rifle hunting.

2614
02:33:06.530 --> 02:33:10.530
Cause if you hit an animal in the body with a rifle,
most likely it's dead.

2615
02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:14.240
It's if you have a real high powered rifle,
it's going to hit the body.

2616
02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:17.580
Even if you're not perfectly where the heart is or perfectly where the lungs
are,

2617
02:33:17.820 --> 02:33:20.790
it's going to blow through everything.
I think he's going down most likely.

2618
02:33:21.180 --> 02:33:22.830
But with a Arrow man,

2619
02:33:22.831 --> 02:33:26.640
you can like launch an Arrow into an animal shoulder blade and they get dig into

2620
02:33:26.641 --> 02:33:30.000
the bone and stick there and then animal runs away with three legs.

2621
02:33:30.360 --> 02:33:32.700
You gotta be super careful.
You got to be really diligent.

2622
02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:37.870
<v 2>It's what my wife is a redneck that all hunters and her family and she calls it</v>

2623
02:33:38.721 --> 02:33:42.720
cave time when an animal gets stuck by an Arrow and it doesn't know how to help

2624
02:33:43.010 --> 02:33:45.530
help itself.
So it goes to the cave and tries to,

2625
02:33:45.531 --> 02:33:49.340
it's where most animals that die is they go to the cave to try to like,

2626
02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:54.500
like I need to nest,
but like when I get hurt emotionally,
my wife would go,
oh,

2627
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:55.543
you need some cake.

2628
02:33:57.420 --> 02:34:02.110
<v 1>Like you're a fucking elk.
The neck in neck,
Bab.</v>

2629
02:34:02.210 --> 02:34:03.043
And I'm like,

2630
02:34:05.380 --> 02:34:09.130
<v 2>Oh yeah,
you have to be really sure.
There's a</v>

2631
02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:13.140
<v 3>easy animated Gif file from one of the most recent podcasts threads,</v>

2632
02:34:13.380 --> 02:34:14.280
whether it's Moose.

2633
02:34:14.460 --> 02:34:18.100
This guy shoots his Arrow with the Moose and it's hard to tell because

2634
02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:21.340
<v 6>it's a Gif.
It's on High Rez,
so it's hard to tell where the Arrow goes,</v>

2635
02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:24.040
but it looks like the Arrow might actually just rock it off.

2636
02:34:24.041 --> 02:34:27.010
The fucking antlers of the Mousse.
It either rockets off,

2637
02:34:27.011 --> 02:34:29.020
the antlers are sticks into his shoulders,

2638
02:34:29.170 --> 02:34:33.620
but he charges at this dude like that's the guy,
right?
He asked me,

2639
02:34:35.230 --> 02:34:39.130
he might not be because they might've been more than one person there because

2640
02:34:39.131 --> 02:34:41.470
there was a guy who was filming it.
He wasn't filming it.

2641
02:34:41.471 --> 02:34:42.880
Most likely he was shooting,

2642
02:34:43.090 --> 02:34:46.010
unless it was a Gopro that was on his bow or it could be dead.

2643
02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:51.610
Have you ever ate pigeons and no,
but you know,

2644
02:34:51.611 --> 02:34:54.070
pigeons were brought over to North America for food.

2645
02:34:54.330 --> 02:34:59.330
They were brought over by people from Europe that a regularly ate them is food.

2646
02:35:00.010 --> 02:35:02.890
We consider them to be pasts and rats with wings.

2647
02:35:02.891 --> 02:35:06.370
Like if you go to cities and pigeons are shitting all over people's cars and

2648
02:35:06.580 --> 02:35:09.760
shitting all over people.
In Manhattan,
people think of him,
it's passed,

2649
02:35:09.820 --> 02:35:14.050
but they were literally brought to North America as an invasive species

2650
02:35:14.051 --> 02:35:17.620
specifically to harvest them for food down and test.

2651
02:35:17.621 --> 02:35:19.330
And actually a lot of them got,
yeah,

2652
02:35:19.331 --> 02:35:22.310
a lot of them got loose and a lot of them became,
you know,

2653
02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:24.580
Pharell and now they are what they are now,

2654
02:35:24.581 --> 02:35:28.330
which is like you go to New York City,
you have flocks of these,

2655
02:35:28.331 --> 02:35:32.110
essentially they're wild pigs.
It just fly through the sky.
I mean,

2656
02:35:32.111 --> 02:35:36.400
they're this weird sort of creature that people brought up.

2657
02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:39.370
We just assume that they're natural.
They're not at all.

2658
02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:42.880
They were brought over here for food.
Oh Wow.

2659
02:35:42.930 --> 02:35:47.820
They're not native to North America at all.
Good.
Really?
Yeah.
Squad.

2660
02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:51.730
If you've ever had squad,
you rather have a squad.
Squad has pigeon.

2661
02:35:52.990 --> 02:35:56.410
I found all this out through Steve or Rinella brought over here as food.

2662
02:35:56.470 --> 02:35:58.420
I'm going to put them on a Google,
those two vanilla.

2663
02:35:58.450 --> 02:35:59.590
I'll tell you one thing about him.

2664
02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:05.160
He reads insane fucking books about animals and wildlife and soap.

2665
02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:11.020
Well,
he's had a lifetime of being immersed,
but it's small details about stuff.

2666
02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:13.060
I literally just fucking sit there like,

2667
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:17.440
how the fuck the New York City pigeon rescue central.

2668
02:36:17.470 --> 02:36:22.240
That's a place to meet girls that cry.
I feel like,

2669
02:36:22.241 --> 02:36:26.680
man,
I don't have enough crying chicks in my life.
I'm kidding.
I don't mean that.

2670
02:36:26.830 --> 02:36:29.170
If you're working there and you're angry and you thinking about blogging on

2671
02:36:29.171 --> 02:36:33.070
Tumbler,
please don't.
I don't mean it.
I'm glad you helping these pigeons.

2672
02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:37.630
They're cute.
I think pins are adorable.
Um,
I do,

2673
02:36:37.631 --> 02:36:40.600
I've never eaten a pigeon.
I think they're cute.

2674
02:36:40.990 --> 02:36:44.620
A lot of people did man pigeons,
but pigeons were brought over here for food.

2675
02:36:47.020 --> 02:36:50.720
They were brought over here a long fucking time ago.
Italians.
Yeah.

2676
02:36:50.780 --> 02:36:54.150
They're brought over here in the 16 hundreds from Europe in,
um,

2677
02:36:54.800 --> 02:36:59.140
in Europe and Canada as well.
It's amazing.
You know,

2678
02:36:59.141 --> 02:37:02.290
pigeons could fly 50 miles an hour.
Wow.
Yeah.

2679
02:37:03.940 --> 02:37:07.840
Some dude on Wikipedia,
he fuck.
He's like,
who are you?

2680
02:37:07.841 --> 02:37:10.300
And the lack of data and it's in the yard.

2681
02:37:10.301 --> 02:37:13.900
Just talk to me about to give a person a pigeon,
a ticket

2682
02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:16.280
in Burbank.

2683
02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:20.930
<v 1>There's wild parrots,
like a gang of wild parrots.
Oh yeah,
I've seen them.</v>

2684
02:37:21.150 --> 02:37:24.680
Wow.
And they,
it's the loudest thing ever out of nowhere.

2685
02:37:24.730 --> 02:37:29.020
It sounds like murder outside of your house.
Whoa.
That's weird.
Yeah.
And,

2686
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:30.260
and if you look online,

2687
02:37:30.261 --> 02:37:33.230
there's websites devoted to them and stuff and they look just like normal

2688
02:37:33.231 --> 02:37:33.890
parrots,

2689
02:37:33.890 --> 02:37:38.810
but they just go around in this huge gang and just that's present green.

2690
02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:43.220
I remember we,
uh,
worked at the,
um,
West Palm Beach Improv,

2691
02:37:43.221 --> 02:37:46.360
the old one way back in the day.
And uh,
I

2692
02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:49.950
<v 6>they put you up at this condo is me and Maddie Kirsch and we looked out the</v>

2693
02:37:49.951 --> 02:37:52.530
window and it's fucking like parrots,

2694
02:37:52.890 --> 02:37:57.780
like actual parents on this power line.
I'm like,
dude,

2695
02:37:57.781 --> 02:38:02.130
there's like real parrots out here.
Like this is the weirdest shit ever.

2696
02:38:02.131 --> 02:38:06.120
Like their parakeets and parents.
And I'm like,
these are like tropical birds.

2697
02:38:06.121 --> 02:38:10.390
Like Miami's tropics.
It is the tropics.
It is a tropics.
Yeah.

2698
02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:14.550
Barely America.
Right.
Let's be realistic.

2699
02:38:14.850 --> 02:38:18.150
It's too awesome to be America.
Too crazy.

2700
02:38:18.610 --> 02:38:23.340
And too many Cubans got in and just made it tropical.
Tropical.

2701
02:38:23.341 --> 02:38:26.760
We're going to Cuba,
Cuba,
do a trip to Cuba.

2702
02:38:27.260 --> 02:38:31.280
<v 1>Oh Dude,
I want to kill opened up relations as well.</v>

2703
02:38:31.310 --> 02:38:33.770
The best thing about the show right now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would love to.

2704
02:38:34.010 --> 02:38:36.890
Those parakeets are parents.
What are those?
He said the Burbank parrots.
Yeah.

2705
02:38:36.891 --> 02:38:39.620
These are actual words.
Actual parrots.
Yeah.

2706
02:38:39.890 --> 02:38:44.180
And you have to come from down because of Youtube.
What?
I know,

2707
02:38:44.181 --> 02:38:47.960
these are just still pictures.
Oh,
did they come from people that were,
uh,

2708
02:38:47.961 --> 02:38:51.410
that had him as pat,
sir.
What'd they come from?
You know,
they,
there's no,

2709
02:38:51.411 --> 02:38:54.020
there's just rumors because Disney's,
there said,

2710
02:38:54.021 --> 02:38:55.700
lot of people think that Walt Disney's,

2711
02:38:55.730 --> 02:38:59.750
it was Walt Disney's parrots and he just hasn't shown,
we find out they're fake.

2712
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:04.130
They're not parents.
Walt Disney is such a motherfucker.

2713
02:39:04.430 --> 02:39:08.450
He's got fake parents out there flying around.
Shitting on people.

2714
02:39:10.300 --> 02:39:11.390
Yeah.
I had a bird.

2715
02:39:11.430 --> 02:39:14.810
I had bird feeders out I bought recently and they found out about it and now

2716
02:39:14.811 --> 02:39:18.800
they won't leave my house alone.
They're there like every day you amaze that.

2717
02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:22.310
There's a cool dude.
That's pretty dope.
Yeah.
They're loud.
Too loud.

2718
02:39:22.350 --> 02:39:26.690
They're annoying as fuck.
But didn't hear floods on.
Put that,

2719
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:31.200
let them into your spiritual compass.
Yeah.
Bringing them into your center.
I will.

2720
02:39:31.700 --> 02:39:34.310
That seems like an amazing thing to have in your neighborhood,
man.
Oh,

2721
02:39:34.311 --> 02:39:38.120
that's cool.
It's really cool because it's a,
I live in a question place,

2722
02:39:38.121 --> 02:39:42.110
so there's horses and parrots.
It must smell awesome.

2723
02:39:42.740 --> 02:39:46.850
Horse Shit and bird shit all stewed up together and the Burbank son.

2724
02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:50.480
How is it that it's illegal if you don't clean up after your dog,

2725
02:39:50.481 --> 02:39:52.910
but you're allowed to just have your fucking horse shit everywhere.

2726
02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:56.430
<v 6>Just empty.
It's giant asshole.</v>

2727
02:39:56.460 --> 02:40:00.600
1200 pound body of stewed grasses.

2728
02:40:06.690 --> 02:40:11.330
Brian,
I'm sorry.
Is this cobblestone?
Is this a dirt road?
You farmer?
Fuck.

2729
02:40:11.570 --> 02:40:15.300
Pick up after that donkey.
Your donkey.

2730
02:40:15.301 --> 02:40:19.260
Just shit all over my previous
dog.

2731
02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:22.710
He's not that green.
This is contributing to global warming

2732
02:40:25.490 --> 02:40:29.720
<v 1>donkey with his dirty ass all it.
Brian said he didn't like Paris in his day.</v>

2733
02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:33.540
He's in bed with a check and he's like the bears out the back.

2734
02:40:33.541 --> 02:40:35.090
Like I never said this.

2735
02:40:42.620 --> 02:40:45.800
<v 5>Oh my God.
Of course.
I always work on</v>

2736
02:40:58.590 --> 02:41:01.300
bringing the fucking parrots into the courthouse.

2737
02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:07.440
We would now like to call prosecution witness the Burbank Paris.

2738
02:41:09.750 --> 02:41:14.550
I've never said this before.
No roofing.
What are you talking about?
You

2739
02:41:18.610 --> 02:41:20.440
know,
two heads is fine.

2740
02:41:21.270 --> 02:41:23.890
I take two hits all the time and I drive

2741
02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:26.560
ingrown hair.

2742
02:41:31.460 --> 02:41:35.550
You know,
all you need to do is you need to Douche with that stuff.
Like plants

2743
02:41:37.810 --> 02:41:38.860
kills everything.

2744
02:41:45.100 --> 02:41:49.810
<v 1>How about,
how about the,
the defense attorney and the judge goes badgering,</v>

2745
02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:54.450
badgering the witness in the objection and then brush.
He goes,
hmm.

2746
02:41:54.490 --> 02:41:56.930
Probably want to Greg too far too far.

2747
02:41:57.210 --> 02:42:02.210
<v 6>Judge Rosenthal would like to ask the bird a few questions about its owners use</v>

2748
02:42:04.501 --> 02:42:09.360
of
antisemetic language.
That's just gonna say NF.

2749
02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:14.200
Yeah.
AndF word.
Could you imagine fucking fucking burger?

2750
02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:15.751
What's the bird?

2751
02:42:15.751 --> 02:42:19.470
Just combined a bunch of sentences and everybody took it as fact.
Like,
hey,
hey,

2752
02:42:19.471 --> 02:42:23.340
hey,
did you guys forget this bird can't fucking talk.
I see a lot of shit.

2753
02:42:23.610 --> 02:42:25.320
I'm repetitive.
You know,

2754
02:42:27.570 --> 02:42:32.520
fucking you don't.
If I say,
look,
I hate assholes,
but Jews are awesome.

2755
02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:33.660
And then this parrot goes,

2756
02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:38.720
I hate awesome asshole Jews that pat fucked up the meaning behind everything I

2757
02:42:40.321 --> 02:42:43.800
stand for.
This parrot has got me on a goddamn stairs.

2758
02:42:43.950 --> 02:42:46.260
Can't even cross examine this fucking shitty parents

2759
02:42:46.770 --> 02:42:50.320
<v 5>back to my guards niggers.</v>

2760
02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:54.310
<v 6>This parrot is fucking doing me in.</v>

2761
02:42:55.060 --> 02:42:57.670
Could you imagine the parent is what you'd be like?

2762
02:42:57.700 --> 02:43:00.550
I can't fucking believe we live in a world where I can get convicted from the

2763
02:43:00.551 --> 02:43:03.970
ramblings of a fucking thing.
They can't even talk back.
How was it parrot?

2764
02:43:03.971 --> 02:43:08.110
Hey Parrot,
what's one plus one?
Okay.
If I asked a retard what one plus one is,

2765
02:43:08.140 --> 02:43:10.900
he couldn't answer me.
I'm not going to let him prosecute.

2766
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:14.310
I'm not going to let him cross examine people.
And when I,

2767
02:43:14.370 --> 02:43:17.590
when I say retired army and anybody with a disease,
just something,

2768
02:43:17.950 --> 02:43:22.930
somebody really fucking stupid.
No diseases,
regular,
regular,
regular genetics.

2769
02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:25.880
<v 2>Oh No,
no,
no,
no chromosomal issues.
Right?</v>

2770
02:43:25.881 --> 02:43:29.310
I think it's the flip side of like something happens and yours,
uh,

2771
02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:31.340
Lance said it about her cousin today and it was,

2772
02:43:31.750 --> 02:43:35.570
it's actually mentally backwards.
Slow,

2773
02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:39.100
retarded.
Now growing quick enough,
we were at the firm,

2774
02:43:39.101 --> 02:43:41.960
whatever until six in the morning about the fever and that's what happened to

2775
02:43:41.961 --> 02:43:44.270
her cousin.
And that's how that conversation started.

2776
02:43:45.530 --> 02:43:48.050
<v 6>I hope that one day retards like smallpox.</v>

2777
02:43:48.980 --> 02:43:52.400
There's some shit that we look back on and we go,
wow,
back in the day,

2778
02:43:52.401 --> 02:43:55.190
like people were idiots.
And when I say retards again,

2779
02:43:55.550 --> 02:44:00.230
I do not mean a person with a disease.
And I mean people with Down Syndrome,

2780
02:44:00.410 --> 02:44:04.370
I mean just idiots.
Just morons.
Like those God hates fags.

2781
02:44:04.371 --> 02:44:08.180
People on the corner waving their flags,
those are retards.
Okay.
Yeah,

2782
02:44:08.990 --> 02:44:13.990
it'd be beautiful if one day we cracked the code to what makes a person worth

2783
02:44:14.841 --> 02:44:17.170
being around and there's no more retards.
Well,

2784
02:44:17.171 --> 02:44:18.440
I think when would run out of them,

2785
02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:20.770
I think we're close to that corner because I think,

2786
02:44:20.900 --> 02:44:22.610
I think you obviously don't go online that much.

2787
02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:26.070
<v 2>No,
I think those people don't know.
But I think the people that really matter,</v>

2788
02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:28.930
the people that are going to stop saying,
please don't use that word,

2789
02:44:29.230 --> 02:44:32.830
have realized that that word is a tad bit outdated and that whatever their child

2790
02:44:32.831 --> 02:44:36.400
is,
is categorized into another,
uh,

2791
02:44:36.610 --> 02:44:41.260
a shade of gray.
Ah,
I wish I wasn't talking about this right now.

2792
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:45.010
I know what you're talking about.
But I think,
I think the parents who go,

2793
02:44:45.011 --> 02:44:47.890
my son's not retarded.
And I know what they used to call that ass,

2794
02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:50.230
but that doesn't apply to me.
I get what you're saying.

2795
02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:53.750
I think they're showing up soon.
Does that make sense?
Well,
no,

2796
02:44:54.200 --> 02:44:56.570
<v 6>I see what you're saying.
Um,</v>

2797
02:44:56.600 --> 02:45:01.600
I think that the idea of calling somebody a derogatory term that's eventually

2798
02:45:01.941 --> 02:45:04.010
going to get phased out.
So just like

2799
02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:09.800
we've abandoned a host of other words over the last 2030 years.

2800
02:45:09.950 --> 02:45:14.580
There was words that were used on television on a regular basis during like the

2801
02:45:14.580 --> 02:45:18.320
Fred Sanford Day,
Sanford and son that you could never put on network TV today.

2802
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:22.880
But I think ultimately that's what the word retard.
I mean,

2803
02:45:22.881 --> 02:45:25.220
if I'm going to be really honest,
that's what it feels like.

2804
02:45:25.430 --> 02:45:29.300
It feels like a word with a shelf life and gets worse.

2805
02:45:29.870 --> 02:45:33.950
We got to get your licks in now while it's barely acceptable and justify them as

2806
02:45:33.951 --> 02:45:38.750
he can and then just like cast it aside and then hope to paint a similar picture

2807
02:45:38.890 --> 02:45:42.230
and in different way.
But it's like all of these mean words,

2808
02:45:42.260 --> 02:45:46.850
whether they're derogatory terms for homosexuals or different ethnicities or

2809
02:45:46.851 --> 02:45:49.550
whatever the fuck it is.
All those mean terms,

2810
02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:51.470
it's like that's kind of what being,

2811
02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:55.220
what's being filtered out and we feel really to look at it objectively if you

2812
02:45:55.221 --> 02:45:58.040
stand back and try to take the whole thing in.

2813
02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:03.280
I think that what we're trying to do is somehow or another through a back door

2814
02:46:03.890 --> 02:46:05.000
get people to be nicer.

2815
02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:08.840
And one of the ways is to get them to stop saying things that aren't nice to

2816
02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:11.060
whether it's uh,
you know,

2817
02:46:11.090 --> 02:46:16.090
ethnic slurs or derogatory terms for gay people or derogatory terms for,

2818
02:46:17.211 --> 02:46:18.390
you know,
fill in the blank.
You know,
what,

2819
02:46:18.391 --> 02:46:22.940
whatever minority or whatever marginalized group you are like that's,

2820
02:46:23.180 --> 02:46:26.060
we're trying to prevent that.
So ultimately that's what it is.

2821
02:46:26.061 --> 02:46:29.720
Like even if it gets out of hand or people get too politically correct about it,

2822
02:46:29.721 --> 02:46:31.250
like what is,
what's the root of it all?

2823
02:46:31.310 --> 02:46:34.460
The root of it all seems pretty positive because the root of it all is like

2824
02:46:34.461 --> 02:46:35.810
trying to eliminate hate,

2825
02:46:36.110 --> 02:46:39.980
are trying to eliminate pain or trying to eliminate discomfort.

2826
02:46:40.130 --> 02:46:43.010
It seems to be that's what the root of it all is,
which is,

2827
02:46:43.310 --> 02:46:47.480
it's hard to argue against.
Right?
Yeah.
How are we,
sorry,
I was listening.

2828
02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:53.140
<v 8>Ah,</v>

2829
02:46:53.900 --> 02:46:57.840
<v 1>uh,
skill back later.
See what's that?
What is that?</v>

2830
02:46:58.590 --> 02:47:02.690
Oh,
I don't have a problem with guys hit on me.
I know,
I know.
I got it.
I got,

2831
02:47:04.670 --> 02:47:08.880
I made a meme.
Welcome to the world.
The Internet.
I still enjoy bird squirts.

2832
02:47:09.060 --> 02:47:12.270
Burt squared stock car.
Yeah.
This is still up.
I think so.
Sure it is.

2833
02:47:13.290 --> 02:47:15.360
I get to people as you shows going burden scores,

2834
02:47:17.300 --> 02:47:21.330
they're just trying to score a snow machine.
Beat you in a unique way.
I love it.

2835
02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:25.470
I love that unique touch where you get to.
Got All right.

2836
02:47:25.740 --> 02:47:30.510
Let's are we close to wrapping this up?
I think we probably should sober you up.

2837
02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:33.700
We got five more minutes ago.
What do you wanna talk about?
Um,

2838
02:47:35.620 --> 02:47:39.580
Joe Cocker Dude,
his cock rocky mountain high.

2839
02:47:40.030 --> 02:47:43.190
That's not Joe Cocker.
Yeah,
it is.
Oh,
I'm thinking of Joe Walsh,
I'm sure.
Walsh.

2840
02:47:43.350 --> 02:47:47.710
Joe Walsh.
Rocky mountain high.
Yeah.
Best drinking over Denver.

2841
02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:51.280
Infrast great fucking song with a fucking cocktail looking out over the

2844

of a string eagle song about cocaine on the Malibu Hotel,

2847

I've got to find the name of the song while I do this.

2851
02:48:29.570 --> 02:48:31.130

Thank you very much.

2868
02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:43.260
I haven't hates the eagles I have in my head.
I remember he hated the dude.

2869
02:49:43.261 --> 02:49:46.170
Hated Ego.
Aw Man.
I fucking hate the eagles.

2870
02:49:47.580 --> 02:49:50.850
Zhi The cab was playing the eagles.
He got mad.

2871
02:49:53.620 --> 02:49:56.760
He'd say,
hey,
either banned.
You can't fucking hate on the eagles.

2872
02:49:57.780 --> 02:50:02.090
Don Henley is in a car.
This isn't that documentary that's on agency.

2873
02:50:02.110 --> 02:50:03.040
A whole math question.

2874
02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:08.280
And he's driving three miles per hour with a cloud deck.

2875
02:50:10.530 --> 02:50:15.530
He's only got 40 more yards or he needs a sucker clown deck cloud Dick to keep

2876
02:50:17.641 --> 02:50:20.220
moving.
Yeah.

2877
02:50:20.221 --> 02:50:23.520
Someone's going to make an animated Gif file of air stations.
Just giant,

2878
02:50:23.850 --> 02:50:27.540
big black dicks dudes have to suck.
They're wearing space suits.

2879
02:50:28.470 --> 02:50:33.310
I don't even know her.
Don Henley.
Desperado no,
stop.

2880
02:50:33.311 --> 02:50:36.630
Just let me fucking please get this out of my mouth.

2881
02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:41.790
Please just swallow it.
Don't stop it.
Don't be scared.

2882
02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:46.820
Okay.
I feel like I'm getting comedically,
uh,
assaulted.
Fucked.

2883
02:50:46.821 --> 02:50:50.780
So Donna fucking Don Henley's Stanley,

2884
02:50:50.870 --> 02:50:54.240
I'm heavily is in a car with a,
it's in the fucking documentary.

2885
02:50:54.360 --> 02:50:58.650
Don Henley's in a car with the drug dealer is holding a lot of weight and

2886
02:50:58.651 --> 02:51:03.570
they're flying that you say,
wait,
I'm quoting,
I'm quoting him.

2887
02:51:04.020 --> 02:51:06.240
He said it in that doc.
You got to see the documentary.
It's really good.

2888
02:51:06.241 --> 02:51:10.890
It's on HBO.
And he says to the drug dealer,
he goes,
ah.
He goes,
hey man,
slow down.

2889
02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:13.800
And the drug,
you would looked over him like real quick and goes,
hey man,

2890
02:51:13.801 --> 02:51:18.570
life in the fast lane.
And then he heard that.
He goes,
that's a good title.

2891
02:51:18.720 --> 02:51:23.520
I want those moments in life where you go singing.
Like,
just like who said,

2892
02:51:23.910 --> 02:51:28.500
what's the best job for killing?
How else?
Right.
It was perfect fucking moments.

2893
02:51:28.501 --> 02:51:31.950
I am way too fucked up.
We should wrap this up.
No,
it's a good point.

2894
02:51:32.220 --> 02:51:34.710
If I was a guy who worked in the fucking logging industry,

2895
02:51:34.740 --> 02:51:39.090
I'd probably be at owl assassin,
motherfucking house.
It's just kill them all.

2896
02:51:39.150 --> 02:51:42.060
And they'd be like,
now what are you going to do?
Listen,
there's no hours.

2897
02:51:42.090 --> 02:51:46.350
Let's get it over with.
It's just fucking start chopping trees.

2898
02:51:46.590 --> 02:51:51.030
There's nowhere else.
This is how assassin has been here.
He can't,

2899
02:51:51.060 --> 02:51:55.530
can't assassinate Alice,
but tuna.
You can suffocate those bitches and rope nets,

2900
02:51:55.590 --> 02:51:59.520
pull them out of the fucking world in which they live and dangled them in the

2901
02:51:59.521 --> 02:52:04.521
air and mother and crush the ones at the bottom who literally gets suffocated

2902
02:52:05.080 --> 02:52:08.080
first by the weight of the thousands of others.

2903
02:52:11.980 --> 02:52:15.260
Everybody in their own way howling for that sweet,

2904
02:52:15.350 --> 02:52:18.340
sweet ocean water till the moon oxygen.

2905
02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:21.070
Massive tune of just felt like crying a little girls

2906
02:52:22.930 --> 02:52:26.960
kills it.
Horrible of pulling oxygen out of the regular atmosphere,

2907
02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:31.120
needs water to stay alive and it knows the water's right there and they can't

2908
02:52:31.121 --> 02:52:34.570
chew through within that
another topic.

2909
02:52:37.300 --> 02:52:39.730
Oh,
I see what you're saying.
He's trying to get you to drink.

2910
02:52:39.910 --> 02:52:44.470
So he's trying to do so fucking hammered and it really is weird that we treat

2911
02:52:44.471 --> 02:52:47.540
tuna that way.
That's kind of fucked up.
Yeah.

2912
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:52.510
Everybody agrees.
Just treat tuna like shit.
I like the way you look at it.

2913
02:52:52.511 --> 02:52:54.640
Like if you flip it on its ear,

2914
02:52:54.760 --> 02:52:59.440
just like the owl problems are the thing with the pygmies in Africa.

2915
02:53:00.700 --> 02:53:05.350
Let's come up with vocal mechanism that we can feed the tuna that can make them

2916
02:53:05.351 --> 02:53:10.280
vocalize what hurts
when you put them in the nets,
they go,

2917
02:53:13.450 --> 02:53:14.283
sorry.

2918
02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:19.090
No one would kill tuna if they talked to you when you killed them.

2919
02:53:19.750 --> 02:53:22.920
What if they were assholes?
Lift.
Two of them are like,

2920
02:53:26.060 --> 02:53:27.920
and when his shit

2921
02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:34.840
like nets net scooping them when nuts.
Fuck him.
I hate him.

2922
02:53:34.841 --> 02:53:39.790
Suffocate in the air.
Pull them out of the sky with a Cardigan to your ass.

2923
02:53:39.791 --> 02:53:44.350
Huh?
As you're pulling them out of the water,
they're like,

2924
02:53:44.351 --> 02:53:48.520
you're fucking quit all your quiz.
I fight you.

2925
02:53:48.521 --> 02:53:53.521
I fade all your fucking hall malls managed to suck my tuna is whole

2926
02:53:59.410 --> 02:54:03.860
sod being fought out of my tuna asshole.

2927
02:54:08.530 --> 02:54:11.740
Denied everybody.
Anything to add?

2928
02:54:12.670 --> 02:54:16.810
What did there to,
hey,

2929
02:54:18.520 --> 02:54:21.700
look at me.
Look at me.
I know you're looking at me,
dad.
You are suck.

2930
02:54:22.660 --> 02:54:27.580
Suck a dick.
You fucking quit.
Now you understand me?

2931
02:54:27.850 --> 02:54:31.240
I might suffocate,
but I'm up here suffocating like a man,

2932
02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:34.900
like a man.
You're going to look to you guys when fish.

2933
02:54:34.901 --> 02:54:39.010
I know you're not going to watch.
It's great.
Shut your hole.
Hungry for it.

2934
02:54:39.100 --> 02:54:42.640
I love this product.
I love what we do.

2935
02:54:42.641 --> 02:54:45.220
This is so much fucking very fun.
It's very fun.
Love it.

2936
02:54:45.250 --> 02:54:48.510
Thank you so much for being anxious.
Thank you.
Letting me be bored.

2937
02:54:49.740 --> 02:54:53.140
You're you're correct.
You're correct.
That's true.

2938
02:54:53.350 --> 02:54:55.840
You need to not drive right now.
Whatever you do,

2939
02:54:56.140 --> 02:54:58.720
Uber the shit out of it.

2940
02:54:59.170 --> 02:55:04.130
Uber the shit out of it.
All right.
Um,
that's it for this week

2941
02:55:04.130 --> 02:55:07.520
<v 3>because this is a holiday week.
Ladies and Gentlemen,</v>

2942
02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:09.530
Chris missed is here.

2943
02:55:09.650 --> 02:55:14.330
So celebrate by trying to get high off a m Anita miscarry mushroom.

2944
02:55:14.331 --> 02:55:15.910
I've never heard anybody who's been successful.

2945
02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:20.300
So it might be bullshit or it might be like you got to get it in the right spot

2946
02:55:20.301 --> 02:55:24.380
at the right time of the year.
But
good luck.
Anyway,

2947
02:55:24.530 --> 02:55:26.540
merry Christmas.
See you next week.
You fucks.

2948
02:55:26.570 --> 02:55:30.290
We got a lot of really exciting guests.
Um,
thank you for five years.

2949
02:55:30.291 --> 02:55:34.040
Brian Red Ban.
Anything to say?
Five fucking years.
Five years and a lot of fun.

2950
02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:38.390
Lots of fun.
Uh,
never anticipated it lasting this long.

2951
02:55:38.420 --> 02:55:39.770
Can't believe what it has become.

2952
02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:45.100
A must stay plugged in a half to help to get it all out.

2953
02:55:46.010 --> 02:55:50.270
Otherwise be stuck with thoughts in head and no one,
no other recourse.

2954
02:55:50.330 --> 02:55:54.940
<v 1>Can I just say,
I wish you were drunk every episode that way.
Can't do that.</v>

2955
02:55:55.580 --> 02:55:58.690
That's not,
that's not special that way then it becomes an alcoholic hour.

2956
02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:02.780
I love this.
I love this world.
Are we harming?

2957
02:56:03.150 --> 02:56:08.150
<v 3>We're humming and the alcoholic three hour show or a thank you everybody.</v>

2958
02:56:09.571 --> 02:56:13.440
No,

my heart,

2959
02:56:13.441 --> 02:56:15.450
everybody that's ever been a part of this.

2960
02:56:15.780 --> 02:56:19.650
Thank you everybody who's ever done any of the episodes or people that listen,

2961
02:56:19.651 --> 02:56:21.780
they're all of it.
It's crazy.
We're all,
you know,

2962
02:56:21.990 --> 02:56:24.940
Brian and I might be the ones that are like somehow or another at the,

2963
02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:28.350
the front of this,
this connective chain,

2964
02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:32.760
but we're all in this weird thing together by some strange way.
And uh,

2965
02:56:32.761 --> 02:56:34.950
and Bert Kreischer you're part of it.
You fuck anything we're saying?

2966
02:56:35.350 --> 02:56:38.920
<v 1>Oh,
thank you so much for letting me be a part of it.
I didn't let you do shit.
No,</v>

2967
02:56:38.921 --> 02:56:42.940
I was having to be funny and I like it.
I,
this has been a blast this life.

2968
02:56:42.950 --> 02:56:44.530
Fucking rock.

2969
02:56:46.390 --> 02:56:49.780

Thank you for five fucking awesome years.
And,

2971
02:56:51.900 --> 02:56:55.300
We're not stopping to the boat hits the rocks hollow.

2972
02:57:28.300 --> 02:57:32.480
<v 0>Larry's did.
There's so much funny shit like that.</v>
