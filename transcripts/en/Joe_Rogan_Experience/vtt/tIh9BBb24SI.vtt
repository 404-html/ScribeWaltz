00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.350
[inaudible] everybody.

2
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:08.310
This episode of the podcast is brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com o.N n.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.460
I.
T.
We are as human optimization website.

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.530
And what we sell it on it is strength and conditioning,
equipment,
supplements,

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.150
healthy snacks,
all different things that can help improve your body,

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.830
including as of today,
the new Werewolf legend Kettle Bell.

7
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:28.080
We have these new legend series,
kettle bells.

8
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:31.320
If you've seen the other ones before the,
uh,
the great apes,

9
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:35.700
kettlebells and the Zombie kettlebells.
We just came out with the newest ones,

10
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:39.180
the legend bells,
and it's,
it's pretty fucking awesome.

11
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.860
It's a 28 kilogram werewolf.
So what does that 54 pounds or something like that?

12
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.080
How does it work?
2.2 more than that.
60 pounds must be 60,
close to 60.

13
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.120
Something like that,
right?
On 16th,
isn't it?
62 pounds.
That sounds good.
Yeah,

14
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:58.570
we suck at metric system marijuana.
They tried to push that shit,
dude.

15
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.030
You remember the high school days?
They were like,
it's the future.
Fuck you.
It is.

16
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:06.000
We've got the bombs bitch inches,
inches,
pounds.

17
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.520
Go Fuck yourself kilograms.
Uh,
anyway.
Um,
the,
uh,

18
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:16.110
the new one that just came in stock is a werewolf,
the 62 pound werewolf.

19
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:19.350
And we have a bunch of other ones that are on the way.
Um,
maybe a big foot,

20
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.430
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It might be becoming

21
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.030
all the kettle bells that we have though.
The,
the,
we have regular ones,
you know,

22
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:31.430
if you're not in a fancy shit,
uh,
that,
uh,
are just standard kettlebells.

23
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.760
And then the,
the,
the primal bells and the legend bells,
the Zombie Bells,

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.380
all those are three d mapped.

25
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.740
And what that means is they're not just good looking.
They're very functional.

26
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.750
They're designed so that they're,
they're completely balanced out.

27
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.610
So when you're lifting them,
there's no weird balance points.
If you,
uh,

28
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:52.920
if you have ever worked with kettle bells before,

29
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.830
it's essentially like a bowling ball with a handle on it.

30
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.010
And it's all about using your entire body as one individual unit to promote what

31
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:04.980
they call functional fitness.
What that means is,
you know,

32
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:08.670
like if you just do bicep curls,
that's great for doing bicep curls,

33
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:11.370
but it's not going to necessarily help you run up a hill.

34
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.940
It's not necessarily going to help you be able to do things physically carry

35
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:16.770
things better.
Um,
what,

36
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:19.560
what I'm concerned with and the kinds of things that we sell it on,

37
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:23.670
it are all things that promote functional strength,
complete body coordination,

38
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:27.420
strength,
things that improve athleticism.
So if you're involved in a sport,

39
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.490
if you are doing martial arts or something along those lines,
um,

40
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.000
this is in my opinion,

41
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.390
the best strength and conditioning type workout and you could ever do,
uh,

42
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:40.140
we also sell all kinds of foods and supplements including the new warrior bar

43
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.360
that is a organic buffalo,
14 grams of protein,
140 calories,

44
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.280
super healthy for you,
no bullshit in it,
no MSG,
no soy,
no lactose,

45
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.680

46
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.450
14 grams of protein in 140 calories with four grams of fat per serving.

47
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.340
Excellent for runners,

50
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.200
I fucking love these things.

which are excellent as well.

I t use the Codeword Rogan and you will save 10% off any and all supplements

54
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.280
were also brought to you by draft kings.com drafting grap.

55
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.370
What's that word you're asking?
Any more coffee?
So what?

56
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:37.810
I'm going to come here after I workout at brains,
what's going on?

57
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.440
Why are we talking?
draftkings.com is the newest sponsor.

58
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:45.220
And if you're one of those dorks like Jamie over here who's into fantasy

59
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:49.120
football,
we were not,
I see dorks.
We'll,
I'll love my friend.
Easy.

60
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.810
We were in Denver and,
and Jamie was in a panic.

61
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.820
The kid was in a tizzy because he couldn't get online with his phone to make his

62
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.480
choices for his fantasy football league.
And Him and his friends there.

63
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.410
They're so serious about this shit that they had to reset.
You guys reset,
right?

64
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:10.210
You've reset the whole draft later and I had to miss it so you got fucked.

65
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.460
Oh,
the second time I got super fucked.
Okay.

66
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:15.370
They got fucked the first time and then you got fucked the second time.
Yes.

67
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.950
That's bullshit.
Do you use you?
You got it first.

68
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.830
I'm pushing for a redraft right now.
I agree with you.

69
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:22.240
I say we've promoted on the podcast,

70
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.930
but what he's doing is just bullshit with draftkings.com is doing draft

71
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.990
kings.com you can actually win money.
This is going to sound ridiculous.

72
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.080
One player on draftkings.com turned 11 bucks into $4,000 in one weekend.

73
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.280
Another guy won a hundred grand a hundred fucking grand the first time ever

74
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:42.910
playing.

75
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.910
Now ready for this one player won a fucking million dollars in one day playing

76
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:51.880
fantasy football.
That sounds like I'm lying to you.

77
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.930
I don't believe it,
but I know it's true.
It's definitely true.
I know it's true,

78
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:57.340
but I'm reading that.
I'm like,
what?

79
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.000
You can make a fucking million dollars in a day playing fantasy football.

80
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.200
It almost makes me want to play fantasy football almost,

81
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.360
but I can't do it.
I can't.
I can't dig that deep into the Dork drawer.

82
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.550
But if I could,
I would do it.
A draft,
kings.com God damn,

83
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.910
if you're into that kind of stuff,
man,
this is the fucking place for you.

84
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:23.440
Draft kings.com has it wired.
You can win huge cash this week.
I might do it.

85
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:28.300
You know,
we should do it once.
We should do it.
I should set up,
we got one.
Okay.

86
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.740
You need to help me,
you to help me.
I don't know who plays good that got good.

87
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.960
I would just,
I'm going to be honest with you.

88
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:38.300
I'll just go for all the black guys.
That's the biggest,
blackest guys.

89
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.430
This the strongest great strategy.
Is that a good move?
And I felt that'll work.

90
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.170
That's all they do.
Right?
And so what they do,

91
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.680
they seem to be better at it.

92
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.280
There's like white line backers that are good,
right?
One.

93
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.470
I'm writing this piece because of the whole John Jones racism thing.

94
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:58.070
I'm writing this whole piece about how when I was a kid,

95
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.770
I used to root for white guys cause it's totally true.

96
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:04.790
I used to root for Gerry Cooney.
Ray Mercer fucking cured me of that shit.

97
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.120
When he beat the fuck out of Tommy Morrison,
I'm like,
I'm so done.

98
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.380
We're only trying to root for white guys.
It just doesn't work out.

99
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.300
Anyway,
where was I?
draftkings.com you can win fucking big cash.

100

Really big cash hurry and get a free entry into the millionaire maker event

103

You're going to quit,

104
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:36.800

113
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.310
Fuck off.
Anyway,
and last but not least,
is that it?

114
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.930
Oh Ting we're brought to you by ting.
Ting is the official provider,

115
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.400
the official cell phone provider for this podcast and a,
I have a tank phone.

116
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:23.234
I have it right here.

117
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.800
It's the Samsung Galaxy s five and my bill just came in.

118
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.510
This is the first month of the official use.
My bill was 18 bucks.

119
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.330
That shit's ridiculous.
So ridiculous.

120
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.120
The average bill is mine's below the average bill cause I don't really call

121
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:39.050
anybody or just text,

122
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.510
but the average bill is $21 $21 for a monthly bill.

123
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.010
What Ting is is a cell phone provider that uses a sprint backbone so they rent

124
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:52.970
time on sprint but then they do it entirely.
There were no contracts,

125
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.190
no early termination fees,
no packages or bundling fees or any of that bullshit,

126
00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:02.030
no overage fees,
and you only pay for what you use.

127
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.180
Instead of having like a fixed bill every month where it's like you know

128
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:05.811
whatever you pay,

129
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:08.120
you get a hundred minutes or 50 bucks or whatever the fuck it is.

130
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.790
Instead of doing that,
it's not that cheap though.
Right now.

131
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.240
Nobody's out shooting now,
whatever it is,
instead of having a hundred minutes.

132
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.820
If you had it like that and you only used 80 minutes,

133
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.910
they're not giving you your money back for that 20 minutes that you didn't use.

134
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.710
But with Ting,
you only pay for what you use.
If you use your phone call once,

135
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.420
I mean if you use your phone once in a month,

136
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:28.340
you're going to have the most ridiculously small bill ever.

137
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.320
Have you use it every day?
It'd be slightly larger,

138
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:33.290
but it'll definitely be smaller than any other provider.

139
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:36.830
You're going to use it with 98% of people would save money with Ting.

140
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.790
That's pretty crazy.
And again,
we're talking about the sprint backbone.

141
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.610
So it's just like you have a spa,
a phone on sprint,

142
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:48.280
you get the exact same coverage,
including a four g,
you know,
um,

143
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.460
and they have all,

144
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.230
if you go to Ting rogan.ting.com they have all the latest cell phones,

145
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.560
including I have,
which is the Samsung Galaxy s five,
which I like it a lot.

146
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.330
It's pretty fucking dope.
And it's waterproof.
It's warranted.

147
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.970
They call it water resistant.
I think that's legal ease.

148
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.910
And it's because there's a little tab here on the bottom.

149
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.450
And if you pop that tab,
I guess water can get in there and you're fucked.

150
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.270
But if you close that bitch up,
like it's not that hard to do,

151
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.630
then it's waterproof.
Yeah,
you can put it in the sink or something like,
Oh yeah,

152
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:19.464
you throw it in the pool.

153
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.460
It's good for like a half an hour at the bottom of the pool.
I'm not trying that,

154
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:26.670
but,
but if he did and also has a f one of those thumb,
thumb print things,

155
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:30.030
press it here in the slide that bitch up and had recognized your thumbprint.

156
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.490
I like it.
I love it.
The screens fucking awesome.

157
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:37.410
And finally a apple came aboard and I'm sure Tim will be carrying the uh,
the uh,

158
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.890
apple phones.
The new iPhone's once they have them once they get them in stock.

159
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.860
But like for right now you can get the Samsung,
uh,

160
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.500
we can get a bunch of different ones.
You can even go old school if you want.

161
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:47.400
If you're a cheap fuck,

162
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.080
you can get the Samsung Galaxy s two for 95 bucks and a,

163
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:55.320
I have one of those I,
that was my first tank phone to fucking,
it's good phone.

164
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:58.140
It's not a bad phone at all.
You can get an iPhone four.
If you're cheap.
Fuck,

165
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.350
you can get that for 137 bucks or you can get an iPhone five for 250 bucks.

166
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.800
Can't go wrong and it's yours.
You own it.
That's it.
There's no contracts.

167
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:10.890
Meaning when you buy a phone with most providers,
what you're doing is you're,

168
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.880
you're paying,
like if a phone,
like if you go to,
you know,
fill in the blank,

169
00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:18.390
whatever major provider and you buy a phone,
it says the phones,
300 bucks.

170
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.650
It's not really 300 bucks.

171
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.030
It's probably six and the other 300 bucks you have to pay over the course of

172
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:24.864
your contract.

173
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:29.010
So if you don't get cell phone service in your house and you're like,
this sucks,

174
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:30.570
I want to cancel and go with another brand,

175
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.260
you can't do it because if you do cancel it,
you owe them 300 bucks.

176
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.410
It's kind of annoying and you don't think about it.
Why you do it.
You just think,

177
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.430
oh,
that's $300 but it's not with Tang,
they don't have any of that bullshit.

178
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.850
If you buy the phone,
you have it,
it's yours.
If you want to cancel,

179
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.630
you just cancel.
That's it.
rogan.tang.com go there.

180
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.490
Save yourself 25 bucks off of any of their fantastic devices.
All right,

181
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.000
that's it.
Tim Barnett from Solo Hunter is here.
Why fuck around Jamie,

182
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:57.923
cue the music,

183
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:07.260
<v 1>the Joe Rogan experience,
try by day Joe Rogan podcast by night.</v>

184
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.733
So

185
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.580
<v 0>over the last couple of years I've really gotten into hunting.
Uh,</v>

186
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.130
I went on my first hunting trip with Steve Rinella and started watching a lot of

187
00:11:18.131 --> 00:11:20.410
hunting TV show.
So I've kind of always watched a lot of them.

188
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.080
But your show really stood out and this is a show,
uh,

189
00:11:24.081 --> 00:11:27.010
you guys on the outdoor channel,
channel two,
channel after channel.

190
00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:31.720
It's called Solo Hunter.
And you go out there,
you,
and,
uh,

191
00:11:31.721 --> 00:11:35.410
I've seen the ones with Ramey warrant as well.
And by yourself,

192
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.280
just bring cameras,
go to these remote locations in,

193
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.330
set up the cameras and you're using your own cameras.

194
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.210
You're like setting up the shots while you're aiming,

195
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.150
like you're getting ready to shoot the animals and you're setting everything.

196
00:11:49.151 --> 00:11:53.290
Like you've got like crane,
little,
little handheld things here and Gopros and

197
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.600
<v 2>it's got to make it very difficult.</v>

198
00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:00.400
So knowing it's a pain to not just get out there and,

199
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:05.050
and you know,
hunting is difficult enough creeping up on animals.
Stalking,

200
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.970
getting into position is difficult enough.

201
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.590
But I would imagine that being your own camera man makes it,
I mean,

202
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:15.950
what's the 50 50% harder?
100% harder.
Ah,
you know,

203
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.040
the hunting part of it,
it's the same.
You're still hunting.

204
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:21.550
And actually it makes me a better hunter because I find that I'm a lot more a

205
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.970
patient and a lot more relaxed about it and more deliberate in my hunting.

206
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:26.500
So it's not just like,
oh,
I got a rifle.

207
00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:29.020
Like all I got to do is get within 400 yards.
Just like,
no,

208
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:32.530
I got a rifle and I got a camera and I got this.
So I feel like I hunt better.

209
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:36.730
But the actual success rate of killing and you're getting it on film and that

210
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:40.570
kind of thing,
it's,
it's a lot harder.
Is it like,

211
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:45.610
would you say like you're like half a successful this way?
No,
I mean,

212
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.670
no,
I don't think it's affected my success rate on,

213
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.300
on actually harvest in an animal,
but it just makes it more,

214
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:57.040
it makes it more difficult to do.
And it's,
it's,
it's,
it's a,
it's a,

215
00:12:57.041 --> 00:13:00.430
it's a hassle.
It's not a hassle.
I mean,
it's what I do,
but it's like it's hard.

216
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.370
It makes it to where it's not just a hunt anymore.

217
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:05.960
It's a hunt that I'm trying to document.
And then now when you,

218
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.920
when you look at it and you're trying to actually produce something good that

219
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.920
people are going to want to watch instead of sad or whatever,

220
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.920
then you're putting more thought into producing it,

221
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.320
then you are the hunting part of it.
And then it's like,
well crap,

222
00:13:17.321 --> 00:13:19.270
now I'm not a very good hunter cause I'm a good produce.

223
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.540
So you have this constant dilemma.
You can tell I'm already tore up about it,

224
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:25.540
but it's like you have this constant back and forth between yourself.
It's like,

225
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.630
screw it today.
I'm just going to hunt,
man.
I'm not going to touch a camera.

226
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.920
And then halfway through the day I'm like miserable because nothing's going on.

227
00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:35.350
I'm like,
I don't even have anything to show for it.
Well,
it's stupid.

228
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:39.070
Turn on the cameras.
You'll have something to show for it.
So,
right.
Do you?
Um,

229
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.920
it's kind of,
it's a tricky way to,

230
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.530
to do a television show and you do all the producing yourself.
You did,

231
00:13:46.531 --> 00:13:48.460
you do all the film editing on the jazz?
Yeah,

232
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:51.760
I do all the editing and that's just kind of kind of my thing for it.

233
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:52.420
And I liked,

234
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.800
I liked it because I can get more emotionally invested into it and I feel like

235
00:13:56.801 --> 00:13:59.350
it can come out different,
but I'm not the best editor out there.

236
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.500
I'm just the one that happens to edit that show because I'm below budget guy.

237
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:06.850
And when I started out it was,
I mean it wasn't even,
it wasn't even ready.

238
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.010
It wasn't time yet,
you know?
How long have you been doing it now?

239
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.040
So solo hunter went to Erin October of 2010 but I had done TV since 2004 in a,

240
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.570
in kind of random ways in that.
But we had the guys that I was partners with,

241
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.960
we hired a producer that was doing all the editing and me and Jeff,

242
00:14:22.961 --> 00:14:26.440
we'd be in the studio just all day and all night just hammering out with this,

243
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.140
with this producer.
And at the end of the day,

244
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:32.800
we weren't 100% happy with what we were getting.
So when we split up,

245
00:14:32.801 --> 00:14:34.220
but I went in my own route,
I was like,
you know,

246
00:14:34.221 --> 00:14:37.510
a lot of only way I'm going to do this and make money and uh,

247
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.260
and do it right is I got to learn to editing.
So I bought,

248
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.830
I mean I bought a computer and just totally self taught myself how to edit.

249
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:46.600
And I started cranking out some,

250
00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:50.140
just some videos online and everything and that's Kinda how I got into it and

251
00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:54.200
got more evolved.
The TV side of it.
She like final cut pro or I,
so yeah,

252
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.430
in fact I'm today,

253
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.190
I'm still using the same exact system that I bought 10 years ago.

254
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.970
That same exact system really change.
Just a few updates.
That's it.
Yeah.

255
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:04.310
I'm using final cut seven,
you know,
old school,

256
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.350
I don't know what the numbers are up to now.

257
00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.800
It's like proactive or something to mark here,
uses Adobe or whatever.

258
00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:14.801
But to me it's like the editing software in that 10 year old state is way more

259
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.360
powerful than my brain is to keep up with it anyway.

260
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.330
So it's like all I gotta do is link video together and slap some music to it.

261
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.070
And I got a TV show,
you know,
it's,

262
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.700
it's funny when you look back at computers that were,
you know,
five,
six,

263
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:29.810
seven years ago,
they were incredibly powerful and much more powerful than for w,

264
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.470
you know,
the applications that most people use them for the,

265
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.850
most people have way over powered computers.

266
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.390
They're just going online and clicking on links and stuff and they have these

267
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:39.860
ridiculous computers that can edit,

268
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.520
crunch video and do all kinds of massive calculations.

269
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:45.890
And then just never use it.
I mean,
at the end of the day,

270
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:49.520
do I have the best TV show on the network?
No.
Do I have the worst one?
No.

271
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.880
Do I have one that I really like and enjoy and love?
Heck yeah.
It's my favorite,

272
00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:56.150
one of my favorites to watch.
My favorite to watch Jim Shockey's uncharted,

273
00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:58.760
that new show that he does,
bores the hell out of me.
Does it?

274
00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:00.770
I love it for what it is.

275
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.370
I don't think it was intended to be a quote unquote hunting show.
No,
it's not.

276
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:05.630
It's like a cultural show.

277
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.480
Brantlyn is probably one of the best producers that you'll ever find.

278
00:16:08.481 --> 00:16:12.230
You know what I mean?
It's,
it's extremely,
extremely well produced and uh,

279
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.160
I think that's good.
But I also think that a lot of producers,

280
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:20.300
especially young producers coming into the industry or are kind of kind of

281
00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:24.320
falling into the game where they feel like the show has to be so well produced

282
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:25.620
to be successful.
Not doesn't it,

283
00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.290
you go out and kill something and you bring it home.

284
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.440
These are hunting shows we're talking about,
you know,
their adventure shows.

285
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.920
They don't have to be the best produce shows and not every shot has to be on a

286
00:16:33.921 --> 00:16:37.940
Jib or on a slider or you know,
of rack focus and all that kind of thing.

287
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.950
Capture the action and the entertainment.

288
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.950
And that's where a lot of these productions miss out.
But uncharted is,

289
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:47.000
is incredible from a production standpoint and from a like,
you know,

290
00:16:47.001 --> 00:16:51.430
almost almost like a modern doc,
modern documentary type of field till he's,

291
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.650
if you haven't seen in Jim Shockey's,
this guy who's been around forever,

292
00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:58.050
this real kind of legendary,
the great white hunter from,
uh,

293
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:03.350
from a BC,
from British Columbia,
and he goes all over the world.
Like,

294
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:03.831
I mean,

295
00:17:03.831 --> 00:17:07.060
literally all over the world click these really remote places in Pakistan.

296
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.510
He's the man to hunt goats.

297
00:17:08.511 --> 00:17:11.780
You've never heard of this weird fucking funky look and goats.

298
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.360
And the thing of it is,
is like,
you know,
he's got the,

299
00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:18.650
he's got the life to back it up and you look back beyond television before he

300
00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:22.490
started doing television.
The man lived that lifestyle.
Like he had it.
I mean,

301
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:23.600
he's one of the true,

302
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.580
true people would actually grew up in a hunting environment in not just hunting,

303
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:31.660
but harsh,
harsh country,
you know,
doing it the right way and,

304
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.560
and building an outfitting business.

305
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.910
And it just happened to evolve at a television career here.

306
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.660
Have you ever watched him on real tree when he would do the little segment?

307
00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:41.090
You know,
in the,
in the middle?
I think it was real tree.
I don't know.

308
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.500
That's a long time ago,
but he's really,
he's really,
you know,

309
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:49.970
deserved and earned where he's at and put himself there.
Yeah.
He's coming on and,

310
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:54.030
<v 0>uh,
sometime in November we're working it out now,
but he,
um,
he,</v>

311
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.950
he does these shows that are almost like their documentaries on the culture that

312
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:02.240
he's going to,
as much as it is about the hunting,
the people he can deal.

313
00:18:02.241 --> 00:18:07.110
It delves in a lot to the people I liked and,
uh,
the way they captured,
you know,

314
00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:10.020
just like some of those villages and the way people live,
you know,
I mean,
it's,

315
00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:11.850
it's incredible.
It really brings a reality.

316
00:18:11.851 --> 00:18:15.080
It's almost like a nat geo type of a feel to it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

317
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.170
I'm not interested in doing that though.
No.

318
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:22.410
The hard thing that I would like to see,
and I don't think it could ever happen,

319
00:18:22.411 --> 00:18:24.810
but like can you imagine going into some of those places with somebody to

320
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:28.110
actually experiencing it and that's the thing that the cameras can't show you.

321
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.350
They can't show you the actual experience because inevitably the guy behind the

322
00:18:31.351 --> 00:18:34.200
camera or the producer is wanting to bring drama into it.

323
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.200
They're wanting to bring something out of what's going to captivate the viewer

324
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:38.160
while I'm going to do this and this,

325
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.900
and he may use a shot that the kid was doing dishes or something and use it in a

326
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:45.570
scene where where something dramatic happened.

327
00:18:45.571 --> 00:18:47.730
The kids crying because he was cutting onions or something.
I mean,

328
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.610
producers have a way of twisting things to make it look more,

329
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.820
more glorified and more glamorous than it might've actually been.
Well,

330
00:18:53.821 --> 00:18:56.070
that's one of the things about hunting shows that hasn't really,

331
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.310
it hasn't happened where it has with reality TV.

332
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.760
A lot of these reality TV shows are the furthest thing from reality that you

333
00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:05.610
could ever imagine.
Everything is completely scripted.
It's calculated.

334
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:08.550
Every event's calculated from the beginning to the end there.

335
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:12.630
These shows are just,
they're just drama shows like bullshit,

336
00:19:12.631 --> 00:19:17.130
fake fiction,
drama shows that they don't have unnecessary,

337
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.430
they don't have a script,
but they have an objective.

338
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.170
Exactly like you and I are going,

339
00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:24.390
we're going to go by Mexican food and you're like,
I fucking hate,

340
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:28.020
but I hate Mexican food and we have a conversation and then you know,
you go,

341
00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:30.000
we go to another place.
Like how about this place,
dude,

342
00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:32.190
I fucking hate Mexican food.
And then come on man.

343
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.640
And like at the end we wind up at a Taco bell and you're like,
hey,

344
00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:38.370
this isn't bad.
Like that's a fucking reality show scenario.

345
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.670
The best reality show would be film from a drone and the people wouldn't even

346
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:44.850
actually know what it was there.
That would be the ultimately reality show.
Yeah.

347
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:45.650
Yeah.
Well,

348
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:49.260
I think they kind of try to do that with like a big brother type scenario,

349
00:19:49.261 --> 00:19:53.040
but everything changes once people know they're being filmed out.
Exactly.

350
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.340
You know,
and it's just,
they're just bad shows.

351
00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:57.960
Most of them are just really bad shows.

352
00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:02.250
Whereas like one of the things I like about your show and Rinella show and a lot

353
00:20:02.251 --> 00:20:04.540
of these hunting shows is they're willing to show failure too,

354
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.370
which is a big part of hunting.
Oh,
it's,
yeah.
It's a majority of hunting.
Yeah.

355
00:20:08.371 --> 00:20:11.010
I mean you're,
you're doing something that's very difficult to do.

356
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.850
You are going into a natural habitat that this animal lives in there trying to

357
00:20:14.851 --> 00:20:18.540
defy.
All of us has all of its natural instincts,
that sense of smell.

358
00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:23.541
It's incredible hearing all these different evolved instincts that they have to

359
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:27.390
keep them alive and you're trying to creep up on them and you're filming the

360
00:20:27.391 --> 00:20:31.830
whole thing.
Yeah.
Well and I think a lot what a lot of people may not look at,

361
00:20:31.831 --> 00:20:36.090
you know,
and I get it sometimes it's just like everything's wrapped around that,

362
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.220
that moment of impact,
that kill,
you know,

363
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.960
and especially when you're filming it by yourself,

364
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:43.350
it's really hard to get that moment of impact in that moment of kill on there.

365
00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:45.840
But that's like one moment,
you know,
and it's,

366
00:20:45.841 --> 00:20:48.430
and it's like the most morbid of the entire,

367
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.140
<v 2>the entire episode or the entire five week long journey after that animal.</v>

368
00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:57.250
But everybody focuses on that moment and it's like,
no,
you know,
there's,

369
00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:02.430
there's 10 days of planning and preparation and hunting and actual stuff going

370
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:07.900
on outside of that one little kill.
How did you get the idea to do this show?

371
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.670
But why didn't you try to do a show?

372
00:21:09.671 --> 00:21:12.650
Did you ever try to do a show with a camera man that comes with it?
I did.

373
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:17.380
So I partnered with a guy in 2000 late 2004 so it was really kind of 2005 and we

374
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:18.250
produced a show on,

375
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:21.370
this was one of the first shows on sportsman channel way back then.

376
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.590
And that shows running today.
You know,

377
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.290
it's continuing on and he's branched off and he's got a couple of shows that

378
00:21:26.291 --> 00:21:29.830
he's doing.
But when I left that shows that,
um,
it's buck ventures,

379
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.550
ventures is where I started and now he's got major league bow hunter and he's

380
00:21:33.551 --> 00:21:35.430
partnered with chipper Jones and that,
you know,

381
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.630
somebody with a lot deeper pockets than I have for sure.

382
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.360
Chipper Jones was a baseball player,
right?
Yeah.
I think that's what,

383
00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:43.690
that's helped me pull,
pull this thing up to your face.
So yeah,
sorry.

384
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.370
Volume as be there.
These are different tweaky microphones.
So,
so,
you know,

385
00:21:48.371 --> 00:21:50.560
I moved out to Oklahoma.
I mean,
I,
when I did that,

386
00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.940
when I do things I like go ballsy in.
It's,
it's everything.
And so I sold my home,

387
00:21:54.941 --> 00:21:56.050
moved.
My wife had a one,

388
00:21:56.051 --> 00:21:58.660
my boy was one year old at the time and we moved to Oklahoma.

389
00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:02.570
We just live just outside of Oklahoma City and Edmond and,
uh,

390
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:07.030
just partnered up and started the show.
Loved it.
And um,
he,
you know,

391
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.130
everything was going to go with,
it was 100% white tail,

392
00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:10.940
but it really wasn't my thing.
You know,
I'm,

393
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.180
I grew up in central Idaho in the middle of nowhere.

394
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:18.490
And for me to transition my hunting style and what I grew up with to focus just

395
00:22:18.491 --> 00:22:21.790
strictly on Whitetail,
just didn't,
didn't fit.
What was your hunting style?

396
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.700
I grew up shoot where I grew up in central Idaho,

397
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:29.620
the nearest Walmarts 70 miles away.
I mean the population one oh one,
you know,

398
00:22:29.621 --> 00:22:32.470
I mean it's,
it's a small farming town in central Idaho.

399
00:22:32.471 --> 00:22:35.170
It's called the lost river valley.
Um,
I grew up right in more,

400
00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:38.770
went to school in Mackey and Arco and,
and uh,
so that,

401
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.890
that lifestyle and growing up on a farm was rugged just in and of itself.

402
00:22:44.201 --> 00:22:47.390
And so I don't know any,
anything,
any different.
And I know,
you know,

403
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.250
I can go out the back door and I can be up on the mountains and just go forever.

404
00:22:51.251 --> 00:22:56.170
I mean,
you could go until,
till forever.
Tell Canada if you want it to.

405
00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.120
But it's so you used to like going out and hiking,
going after these animals,

406
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:05.020
stalking them,
mountains,
western hunting.
You know where it's,
you've got elk,

407
00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:07.660
you've got deer,
bear,
mountain lions.
I mean you've got everything.

408
00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:10.380
The whole Western hunting,
hunting whitetail is completely different.
And one,

409
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.860
a white tail deer might live in just a few square miles.
It's entire life,

410
00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.250
you know,
and you're hunting farmland predominantly or river bottoms.

411
00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:20.290
And so you're really,
you know,
that's,

412
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.890
that's the most widely hunted game animal that there is.
But it's like,

413
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:28.270
it's almost like a farm out of venture.
The adventure starts and ends right here,

414
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:32.200
you know,
within within 200 acres or whatever.
When I go on a hunt for elk,

415
00:23:32.201 --> 00:23:35.710
the adventure,
there's,
there's miles,
you know,
hundreds of miles that,

416
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.180
that a person could go on and the West.

417
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:39.420
And when you get up on some of these peaks and you,

418
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.470
you may have experienced on some of the stuff in Alaska,

419
00:23:41.471 --> 00:23:45.140
but like you get up there and it's like,
Gosh,
Dang,
there's a lot here.
You know?

420
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.650
Yeah.

421
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.400
I mean there's so much country and there's no limitation to how far you can go

422
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:52.730
and what you do.
So that's,
that's when I say my style,
that's my style,

423
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.190
getting out remote.
And,
uh,

424
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.210
if that's way more fascinating to me to be in like completely wild environments

425
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:00.110
like that.
Like you said,

426
00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:04.760
standing on a peak looking out in Alaska and what you're seeing is just mountain

427
00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:09.250
range is just hill after hill after hill and valleys and just,

428
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:10.280
it's looks endless.

429
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:13.220
It looks endless and there's no one out there and you're looking straight ahead.

430
00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:14.600
You're not seeing any fucking people.

431
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.690
They're seeing trees and there's some animals out there.
Go find them.
Yeah.

432
00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.870
And that's,
that's how I grew up.
I mean,

433
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.070
I would go out a lot of times during school and I'd just go up,

434
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.950
sleep on the mountain,
come back to chores,
milk cows,
go to school,
you know,

435
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.480
go to football practice,
go home,
do chores,
go up on the mountain,

436
00:24:32.481 --> 00:24:35.120
sleep on the mountain,
come back home.
I mean,
that was kind of how,

437
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:40.510
how my brothers and I grew up and
it's just,

438
00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.620
I mean I just have a yearning for the wild.
I mean there,

439
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.280
there are some of the coolest experiences that I've had in life have been when

440
00:24:45.281 --> 00:24:48.640
I'm by myself and go and do something just so totally random that,
that,

441
00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.540
that nobody else would really even think about.
I say Shit,
I sit and say nobody.

442
00:24:52.541 --> 00:24:56.230
But it's like,
you know,
in college I'd drive home two hours to my folks' house,

443
00:24:56.231 --> 00:24:59.140
then I drive another hour up to the canyon.
By the time I get to the trail head,

444
00:24:59.141 --> 00:25:03.520
it's 11 o'clock at night,
hike in for three or four hours,
find somewhere,
sleep,

445
00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.860
get up on top of the mountain.
And I'm sitting there as,

446
00:25:05.861 --> 00:25:09.100
as the sun's coming up and three wolverines come up,
you know,

447
00:25:09.101 --> 00:25:12.130
and circle the lake and it's like back then,
you know,
in the,

448
00:25:12.131 --> 00:25:14.800
in the 90s there weren't wolverines in Idaho.

449
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.000
There weren't supposed to be anyway.

450
00:25:16.001 --> 00:25:20.230
I mean I was one of the very first or very few to actually see wild wolverines

451
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.910
in Idaho.
And it's like,

452
00:25:21.911 --> 00:25:26.140
had I not been there by myself experiencing that in that canyon,
you know,

453
00:25:26.141 --> 00:25:28.240
if there's other people or other things,

454
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.580
those wolverines might not have been as comfortable,
you know,

455
00:25:30.581 --> 00:25:34.060
but because I was there by myself and I'm the only one there looking down over

456
00:25:34.061 --> 00:25:36.160
it,
I had that experience.
And there's,

457
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.290
there's a lot of opportunities like that that
when you have someone else there,

458
00:25:41.291 --> 00:25:44.140
you're focused on the group.
You know,
when you're focused on your conversations,

459
00:25:44.141 --> 00:25:46.570
your buddies,
your friends and everything,
you're not,

460
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.730
you're not really tuned in to what's around you.

461
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.680
You're not tuned in to your surroundings.

462
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.920
And so there's certain things that I think you miss out on when you've got other

463
00:25:53.921 --> 00:25:56.560
people there.
And it's not that I don't enjoy that sometimes,

464
00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.630
but I feel like when I'm there,

465
00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:03.450
like there's a connection,
you know,
there's a connection to the land,

466
00:26:03.451 --> 00:26:06.390
there's a connection to the environment and uh,
you know,

467
00:26:06.391 --> 00:26:10.210
he could bring all of it into if,
if you're,
if you're a Hippie,
you know,

468
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.030
tree hugger,
Voodoo type person,

469
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.610
you can bring in the nature and the gods and all that kind of stuff into the

470
00:26:14.611 --> 00:26:17.430
whole element.
But that really and truly is,
is what it is,

471
00:26:17.431 --> 00:26:21.930
is you're out there with no one but yourself and God and his creation.

472
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.480
I mean that's it.
It's all surrounding you.
Yeah.

473
00:26:24.481 --> 00:26:28.500
And being like that deep in nature where you're actually a part of it because

474
00:26:28.501 --> 00:26:31.530
you're not,
you're not talking to anyone.
So there's no,

475
00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.920
there's no conversations going on in your conversations there just with myself.

476
00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.970
But you know what I'm saying?
It's like you don't,
there's nothing,

477
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.140
no anchor that brings you back to civilization.
You just seeing wild shit.

478
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.520
You're just seeing wild life.

479
00:26:44.521 --> 00:26:48.150
You're seeing animals that would exist that way regardless of whether or not you

480
00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:50.030
were there or not.
And the sad part about it is,

481
00:26:50.031 --> 00:26:54.120
is the more the older I get and the more I live in the city and the more the

482
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:56.670
more likely falls and gets busy and hectic.
I mean right now,

483
00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.330
right now it's just seems like it's a train ride just straight up and things
are,

484
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.450
things happening are happening fast.
It's just like this opportunity here.

485
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.030
The more more than those things happen,

486
00:27:06.031 --> 00:27:09.870
it's like the more desensitized I come to the natural experience.

487
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.040
And so when I'm out there I find myself checking where's my phone?
You know,

488
00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:15.990
I wonder what emails I've got.
I wonder who's called.

489
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:21.390
And that really sucks because I'm desensitized to the nature of man,
you know,

490
00:27:21.391 --> 00:27:23.880
to what I grew up as,
you know,
and that kind of thing.
And that's,

491
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:26.010
it's good in a way,
but it's also bad.

492
00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:28.620
And so I like have taken the opportunity to just like,
you know,

493
00:27:28.621 --> 00:27:30.600
this week I was supposed to be up hunting in Idaho,

494
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:32.010
but I had too much work to do.

495
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:36.150
I had projects I had to had to get done and it worked out great because it freed

496
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:41.040
up our time where you and I could get together.
But I know that Sunday,
you know,

497
00:27:41.041 --> 00:27:42.060
as soon as I get out of church,

498
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:44.670
I'm hauling butt up to Idaho and I'm going to start elk hunting for a week.

499
00:27:44.671 --> 00:27:45.960
So I'm going to have that,
you know,

500
00:27:45.961 --> 00:27:48.540
eight to 10 days of solace to really get back into it.

501
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.190
But then at the end of that trip,

502
00:27:50.191 --> 00:27:53.850
it's going to be like I've got nine hours to drive home and think about getting

503
00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:58.660
back into the daily life,
you know,
to regular,
regular world,
regular world.
Um,
do,

504
00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.850
do,
do you have a regular job outside of this?
This is,
people think that I,

505
00:28:02.851 --> 00:28:05.970
that I hunt for a living or that it's all about the hunting and the show and the

506
00:28:05.971 --> 00:28:10.320
hunting is like 10% of my life,
you know,
outside of that I run my business,

507
00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:13.500
I got products just like you do and,
and I'm trying to grow,

508
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:14.580
grow the business space.

509
00:28:14.581 --> 00:28:17.460
And this this year I kind of took it upon myself that this is the year I wanted

510
00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:21.630
to grow my business.
You know,
I had the TV show established,
I had,
you know,

511
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.480
you know,
making a good living and everything,

512
00:28:24.481 --> 00:28:27.900
but this is the year that I wanted to take it another step and actually make,

513
00:28:27.901 --> 00:28:28.860
create a business of it.

514
00:28:28.861 --> 00:28:31.920
That's where I brought on mark and we started producing another show on

515
00:28:31.921 --> 00:28:35.070
sportsman channel called off grid hunter and experimenting with that.

516
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:36.450
And now it's like,
you know,

517
00:28:36.451 --> 00:28:39.390
I've got two other sponsors that have come to me and said,
hey,
you know,

518
00:28:39.391 --> 00:28:42.540
you're doing a good job with the productions.
We've been thinking about x,

519
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:44.520
y and Z.
Would you be interested in producing,

520
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.590
producing our shows for us and doing different things.

521
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.790
So I'm now branching and trying to grow the production side of it as well as

522
00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:54.940
solidify the brand of Solo.
We do a good,
you do a really good job,
uh,

523
00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:59.550
producing the show yourself the way it's edited.
It's interesting.
It's not just,

524
00:28:59.700 --> 00:28:59.941
you know,

525
00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:03.120
here's a video camera that I turned on when I walked up to the top of the hill,

526
00:29:03.121 --> 00:29:04.920
like Blair witch style.
Like,
you know,

527
00:29:04.921 --> 00:29:08.860
you cut in music and sound effects and there's a lot of close ups and I mean,

528
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.240
not Remy calls with the Gopro show,
he's like,
we're not the go pro show anymore.

529
00:29:12.241 --> 00:29:15.690
That's awesome.
Yeah,
you definitely,
uh,

530
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.420
edit things really well.
And,
and that,
that's a,

531
00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:22.230
that's a big part of watching any kind of a show to draw people in.

532
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.460
But in that show in particular,
you're,
you're telling a story and your story is,

533
00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:30.660
you know,
whatever animal you're chasing after,
wherever you're going,
you know,

534
00:29:30.661 --> 00:29:34.140
you're entering into that environment and then you kind of like,
you're,

535
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.180
you're explaining your thoughts along the way.

536
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.630
Like one of them I really liked was you alone.
Um,

537
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.220
you were Moose hunting in Alaska

538
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.680
<v 0>and,
uh,
you know,
you were,
you,
you know,</v>

539
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:48.190
stuck in the tent and it was raining outside.
I see.
And I had a guy with,
I mean,

540
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:49.001
people need to know,

541
00:29:49.001 --> 00:29:51.520
I had a guy with me and I said that right on the episode there was another guy

542
00:29:51.521 --> 00:29:54.070
that had the tag,
but I mean you're out there.

543
00:29:54.071 --> 00:29:56.050
You're out there in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah.

544
00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.820
And because you're out there like that,
because you're in this like intense,

545
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.750
wild environment,
you know,
you get to,
when you're,

546
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.530
when you're talking about and when you're,
you know,

547
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.080
expressing yourself to the camera,

548
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.230
you're getting this kind of insight of what it's like to actually be there.

549
00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:12.190
And for a lot of people,

550
00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.190
that's the closest we're ever going to come to being out in there in the wild

551
00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:18.550
Bush of Alaska,
chasing after a move.
So it makes it,
it's,

552
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.690
there's like the solitude comes across on camera and it's a,

553
00:30:22.691 --> 00:30:26.110
it's an interesting element that you don't get an a lot of these shows because a

554
00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:28.870
lot of these shows,
it's an expedition.
You got a couple camera man's,

555
00:30:28.871 --> 00:30:31.360
you've got a guide,
you get to hunter's got all these people there,

556
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:35.230
they got a fucking the ATV,
everybody's going out into the woods together.
It's a,

557
00:30:35.231 --> 00:30:36.760
it's a journey,
you know,

558
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:41.970
but the solitude of you being alone in these remote environments and you know,

559
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.930
quite honestly dangerous environments,
especially like the Alaska one,

560
00:30:46.931 --> 00:30:48.650
cause there was bears out there at grizzlies,

561
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:52.760
you're packing a pistol when you go to take a shit,
you know,
it's,
it's,

562
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.300
it's ironic that,
you know,
the,
the worst,
the voice,

563
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:59.080
most hair raising experiences I've had have not even been Alaska,
you know,

564
00:30:59.081 --> 00:31:01.210
it's been closer to home and that kind of thing.
I mean,
yeah,

565
00:31:01.211 --> 00:31:05.680
in Alaska I got charged by a black bear.
I mean it was,
was it a female?

566
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.880
It had to have been because what happened is,

567
00:31:07.881 --> 00:31:12.180
was we got off the boat to set up to start call for a Moose and uh,

568
00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.500
doing some moose calling.
And I was like,
and it was raining real hard.

569
00:31:14.501 --> 00:31:15.400
And I'm like,
you know what,

570
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.160
I got to go back and get my camera just in case something happens.

571
00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.980
Or I hadn't had to go back and get something.
I don't remember what it was.

572
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.410
So I walked back to the boat and as I'm walking back,

573
00:31:23.411 --> 00:31:26.980
I hear some noise behind me.
And as I turned,
this bears just coming.
I mean,

574
00:31:26.981 --> 00:31:29.740
it's booking,
hauling it just as fast as it could run.

575
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.400
And all I did was just just wheel.
The camera just yelled bear,

576
00:31:33.401 --> 00:31:37.090
bear's loud as I could.
And the thing just skidded,
stopped and took off.

577
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.360
And as it turned around,
I mean,
I thought I saw another one in the back.

578
00:31:40.361 --> 00:31:42.160
So that's the only thing that,
that,
I mean,

579
00:31:42.161 --> 00:31:44.230
it's the only thing that could have been,
was a bear hunting,

580
00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.780
which isn't gonna happen.
A bear's skin,
whatever.

581
00:31:46.781 --> 00:31:50.140
So it had to been a sow with some cubs or something on that.
Yeah,
I mean,

582
00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:55.090
really at that instant you're relying on luck,
you know,

583
00:31:55.091 --> 00:31:58.990
you're relying on that bear to stop and turn around because all I had to at that

584
00:31:58.991 --> 00:32:01.060
time to protect myself was my voice.
You know,

585
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.770
by the time I would've got to my gun,

586
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.160
the bear would have been on me and you know,
bears bite.

587
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.970
And so things would have been pretty bad for,

588
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:13.240
for a little while had that bear not turned around.
And you were by yourself?
No,

589
00:32:13.241 --> 00:32:17.710
I,
that was what it was there.
Ted was,
um,
yeah,
he was right in the,
in the,

590
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.110
in the general area because we were both hunting moose together.

591
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.530
Have you ever been out there by herself and had a situation come up where you're

592
00:32:23.531 --> 00:32:26.860
like,
fuck,
I might,
I might not be able to get outta here,

593
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:30.880
like be an injured or you know,
fuck your knee up or anything like that?

594
00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:35.110
Jacked up my knee pretty good.
And uh,
in New Zealand when I was,
when I was,

595
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.150
went to New Zealand there,
helped with Remi,
um,

596
00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:41.660
I had just killed my tar and was coming off the mountain and I mean I wasn't

597
00:32:41.661 --> 00:32:43.580
very far from the bottom,

598
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:48.830
but I had stepped in this fern or something and just Jack my knee and I remember

599
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:52.430
falling and I kind of blacked out there for a minute.
And as I'm laying there,

600
00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:56.510
I'm thinking just,
I'm just like,
please don't,
don't blow my knee out,
you know?

601
00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:00.800
And I just laid there for like 30 40 minutes until kind of the throbbing and the

602
00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:03.980
pain kind of went away and then I was able to get up and kind of walk it off.

603
00:33:03.981 --> 00:33:07.970
But that's,
that's one it gets,
you know,
that's probably one,

604
00:33:07.971 --> 00:33:10.790
it's the most dangerous is when you're hauling,
you know,

605
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.940
a hundred plus pounds on your back and you're coming down rough country,

606
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.760
because I'm not going to go back up there and pack my camp out.

607
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.480
So you're going to load as much weight as you can on your bag in his stoop.

608
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.720
Is it,
something could happen in any time,
you know?
I mean,

609
00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:27.980
the guy could step and roll his ankle at anytime,
you know?
It's just kind of,

610
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:31.670
by us being out there alone,
it makes it that much more dangerous,
I guess.

611
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:32.630
Stupid really.

612
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:37.630
People who have never gone hiking in these remote areas and the,

613
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:41.630
you know,
like,
especially when you're going after these mountain animals,

614
00:33:41.631 --> 00:33:43.280
whether it's elk or something like that,
they don't,
they don't,

615
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.130
they probably don't understand how treacherous some of the terrain is.

616
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:50.060
And you add into that the fact that you've got a hundred pounds of meat packed

617
00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:52.850
onto your back and you probably gonna have to do it several times,

618
00:33:52.851 --> 00:33:55.430
especially with an elk.
Yeah.
I laughed at my buddy.

619
00:33:55.431 --> 00:33:59.750
He killed a deer last week and he's posting these pictures on Instagram of the

620
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:01.340
blisters on his feet and everything.
He's like,

621
00:34:01.341 --> 00:34:04.350
come on my third trip back in to get my dear.
And I'm like hell,

622
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.550
if that man just cut the thing up and put it all on your bag and come out once,

623
00:34:07.551 --> 00:34:10.520
you know,
don't,
how big was the deer?
Uh,
you know,
a bone down,

624
00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:13.190
a boned out deer is going to be 90 pounds,
you know,

625
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:17.720
90 to 100 pounds is all got your camera gear or you got your camping gear and

626
00:34:17.721 --> 00:34:21.170
that kind of stuff too.
So that's where a deer,
you know,
deer is the one trip,

627
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:25.860
one trip or for a guy.
Yeah.
I've talked to people that like,
um,
Rinella.

628
00:34:25.861 --> 00:34:28.970
His brother fucked his backup essentially for life.

629
00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:33.830
We're trying to haul out Mousse and now he has pack llamas lamas that he brings

630
00:34:33.831 --> 00:34:37.640
with him.
And my brother tried llamas for awhile now.
I think he's got to go.
No,

631
00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:40.700
I think he got a horse now.
He had goats too.
It was like,
then I can just,

632
00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.770
Rinella has the,
his,

633
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:47.450
his brother has these llamas and they put them in a van and like the llamas,

634
00:34:47.451 --> 00:34:50.390
like,
they fucking piss in the van,
the disgusting animals.

635
00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:53.600
But they're just hardy is shit.
The,
you know,

636
00:34:53.601 --> 00:34:56.240
he lives in Montana and he's got them out there in Montana.
They just,

637
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.640
he just tied to a tree and leave them there and they just,

638
00:34:58.641 --> 00:35:01.640
it's freezing fucking cold out.
They just stand there.
They don't give a shit.
Oh,

639
00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:04.450
they probably,
they do.
They just get to say anything about it.
They probably,
yeah,

640
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.570
but they're super durable.
Yeah.
And um,

641
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:11.060
the idea is you just got to make sure that you pack them evenly.
You know,

642
00:35:11.061 --> 00:35:13.910
you can't have like 70 pounds off to the right and you know,

643
00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:17.450
and a hundred pounds off to the left.
It has to be totally balanced out.

644
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:21.260
But once it's balanced out,
those fuckers can just go.
Yeah.
Yeah.

645
00:35:21.261 --> 00:35:24.100
We grew up hunting with the horses,
horses and mules mostly,
you know,

646
00:35:24.101 --> 00:35:26.900
so I mean it's,
it's nice to have that ability to pack,

647
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:31.310
pack camp in and pack all the way.
And I've thought about doing,
you know,

648
00:35:31.311 --> 00:35:34.940
a pack trip solo,
a solo hunting pack trip.
But that's,

649
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.350
I mean you're bringing in a whole other element.

650
00:35:36.351 --> 00:35:38.250
You bring it in an that you can't control,

651
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:42.120
<v 2>you can't control their moods or whatever.
I mean,
it's just that one more,</v>

652
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.490
one more thing that could go wrong.

653
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.620
I mean all it takes is the horse to kick you in the side of the head and you're

654
00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:47.710
done.
Or you know,

655
00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.450
you horse kicks you in the knee or a horse takes a fall or any of those kinds of

656
00:35:51.451 --> 00:35:54.860
things and that's,
you know,
it can mess it up in a hurry.
So I've always,

657
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:55.651
I've just,

658
00:35:55.651 --> 00:35:58.800
lately I've just got to the point where I just want to throw crap in my backpack

659
00:35:58.801 --> 00:36:01.320
and go,
yeah,
because I can control me.
You know,

660
00:36:01.321 --> 00:36:04.410
I know where my brain is going to be and I know where I'm stepping.

661
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.090
But all that horse has to do is take,
take one wrong step and eh,
yeah,

662
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:11.860
it's,
odds are it's not going to happen.
But I've had,

663
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.760
I've had a friend that was killed on a horse,
you know,
really what happened.

664
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:17.190
He was on a pack trip and I remember I was,

665
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.430
I was working at the carpet store and when I was,
when I was a kid and uh,

666
00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:23.940
I was like,
John,
why don't you stay here?
I got this job I need you to do.

667
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:27.630
And he was a carpet installer and I was one of the salesman.
I'm like,

668
00:36:27.631 --> 00:36:30.270
I got this job that I want you to,
that I need you to do.
He's like,
nope man,

669
00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:32.850
I'm going on this pack trip.
I'm like,
come on,
it's only a two day job.

670
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:36.780
He's all no.
And I remember him vividly saying,
he's like,
life's too short.

671
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.860
He said,
I'm,
I've,
I promised myself no matter what,

672
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:43.230
the money is not going to get in the way and I'm going to live my life.

673
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.420
And that on that very trip,
his horse,

674
00:36:45.421 --> 00:36:49.020
something spooked his horse and it came over on top of him,
on the Saddle Horn,

675
00:36:49.021 --> 00:36:53.670
ruptured his spleen.
And uh,
he went into the hospital.
When they got back,

676
00:36:53.671 --> 00:36:58.530
he went into the hospital like 220 pounds the next time I,
you know,

677
00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:03.090
when he got out of the hospital,
he was like 160 pounds or something.

678
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.590
And it wasn't just a couple of months later that he died from that because he

679
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.420
had given his kidney to his son.

680
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.650
And so his kidney and spleen and everything were,

681
00:37:13.651 --> 00:37:17.320
were jacked up and he lost his life.
You know,
from that event that can happen.

682
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.430
My brother,
you know,
a couple of years ago,
horse came over on the top of him,

683
00:37:20.431 --> 00:37:24.440
crushed his pelvis.
Oh,
chief happens when you got wild.
When you've got animals,

684
00:37:24.441 --> 00:37:28.890
the only stuff can happen,
you know.
Yeah.
I have a friends that ride horses.

685
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.230
They like,
uh,
my friend's wife actually,
she,
she jumps horses.
They,

686
00:37:33.231 --> 00:37:35.490
they go to these fucking rings and they,
they,

687
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.670
they get their horses to jump over logs and shit.
And I'm like,

688
00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:42.960
what are you doing?
Like why is that exciting?
Like what's going on there?

689
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.220
That's got to be that again,
I guess,
but we used to see,
we used to have,

690
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.861
my brothers and I,

691
00:37:46.861 --> 00:37:50.400
we have the reputation of breaking horses so people would bring the wild

692
00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:52.440
mustangs that they'd catch off the desert and stuff,

693
00:37:52.441 --> 00:37:54.660
which I know now living in Nevada,
they're not that wild,

694
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.510
but they'd bring us these horses that they had adopt,

695
00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.750
thinking that they would make them as kids horses or something and we'd have to

696
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:04.050
break these horses.
How do you catch them?
I don't know how they caught him.

697
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:04.920
I Dunno.

698
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.400
They just bring them to us in a trailer and we smack them around a little bit

699
00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:12.240
and break them.
Can you break a wild horse or real wild horse?
We had all,

700
00:38:12.241 --> 00:38:14.490
I mean we only had one that we really couldn't break.

701
00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:19.010
They were that we didn't rake is what he'd do eat it.
No,
I,

702
00:38:19.011 --> 00:38:21.210
I can't even remember what happened to that.
One of them.

703
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.640
The guy took back and it ended up getting away and they had to,

704
00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.010
they ended up shooting it,
you know,
somewhere cause it got on,

705
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.410
got out and got on wild land ended up shooting that one.

706
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.550
Why they shoot it because it got on wild plant.

707
00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.850
I don't think they could catch it.
They couldn't catch it for a while.

708
00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:35.980
They tried to,
what they tried to do is shoot it in neck and hit that

709
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.480
<v 0>tendon.
So with horses,
a lot of times like western reining horses and stuff,</v>

710
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:43.600
a lot of times they'll go in and snip a tenant in their neck to get them to keep

711
00:38:43.601 --> 00:38:44.830
their head level.
Cause it's,

712
00:38:44.831 --> 00:38:48.940
I guess it's better for though the horse reins better and acts better than that

713
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:50.950
and it's not going to flip his head up and flail its head.

714
00:38:50.951 --> 00:38:53.130
So they'll flip this tenant.
So this horse,
so the,

715
00:38:53.131 --> 00:38:56.560
the sharp shooter went in trying to shoot this horse and the tenant in the back

716
00:38:56.561 --> 00:38:59.920
of the neck to kind of just break him down so they could catch this horse.

717
00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:00.800
Cause there was a big,
uh,

718
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:04.750
black and white Tevino stallion that they wanted to catch.
And they,

719
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:08.400
I think he just kind of missed and,
and killed it.
What the fuck?

720
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:11.200
Little bit of a kind of a sharp shooter does he think he is.

721
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:15.070
I don't really should have hired me a moving horse and you're going to shoot it

722
00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:18.340
in a perfect spot on that.
I can't imagine shooting a horse anyway.

723
00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:21.180
That's why when I see these guys going to Africa and shootin zebras and stuff,

724
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.480
I mean,
I grew up on a farm.

725
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:26.290
I have such a love and a passion for animals that I can't imagine.

726
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.510
I can't imagine that.
Well,
we were,

727
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:32.680
we were talking about that before the show that it's a weird thing for people to

728
00:39:32.681 --> 00:39:37.540
hear when someone says they're a hunter,
but they love animals.
You know,

729
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.920
like I got this tweet the other day where this woman,
uh,
she was,
uh,

730
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:46.810
someone tweeted me something and she's tweeted,
why would you talk to him?

731
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:51.280
He kills bear for fun and you know that,
no,

732
00:39:51.281 --> 00:39:55.750
I don't kill.
I've killed one bear wasn't for fun.
I eat it.
But did you have fun?

733
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:59.830
I did.
I enjoyed it.
It was,
I mean I guess I kind of killed a bear for fun.

734
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:04.030
Right?
Like I was a part of it.
There's remorse.

735
00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.540
Well bears are pretty fucking cool.
They're interesting.
They're interesting.

736
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.810
And uh,
you know,
I went with,
uh,
Cameron Hanes.

737
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:15.250
We're bow hunting in a Alberta and if you've never been up there,
first of all,

738
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:19.270
they have to kill bears up there.
There's all a lot of fucking bears up there.

739
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:23.770
They estimate between three and eight per square mile.
And uh,

740
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.410
when you get up there,
you realize that's true.

741
00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.690
Cause like when you're sitting and you're waiting,

742
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.520
they all of a sudden within an hour or so,
they just start showing up.
One,
two,

743
00:40:33.521 --> 00:40:37.630
three.
I mean we,
we saw as many,
six,
seven barrels at a time.
It's fucking crazy.

744
00:40:37.631 --> 00:40:41.590
And the cannibalizing each other left and right.
They're eating cubs.

745
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.720
You have to kill the minerals themselves,
diseases and all kinds of stuff.

746
00:40:44.721 --> 00:40:47.380
If they overpopulated.
Yeah.
And they are overpopulated up there.

747
00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:49.960
You have to kill the Boers if you don't kill the Boers,

748
00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.170
they just feast on babies.
You know,
and it's,

749
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:56.950
it's just a numbers thing.
They don't have anything to kill them.

750
00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:00.040
Nothing kills them.
So if humans don't kill them,

751
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:04.030
then their populations get out of control.
They get run into starvation issues.

752
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.290
Uh,
there's all sorts of things that happen and they taste good.
You know,

753
00:41:08.291 --> 00:41:10.650
and people are fucking weird,
man.
This,

754
00:41:10.651 --> 00:41:14.320
this whole hunting thing has really exposed me to a lot of very strange

755
00:41:14.321 --> 00:41:16.420
hypocrisy is that people just accept.

756
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.650
And one of them is this fucking guy came up to me at the airport wearing leather

757
00:41:20.651 --> 00:41:22.240
shoes and he goes,
man,

758
00:41:22.241 --> 00:41:25.120
I was really disappointed to find out that you killed a bear.
I go,
dude,

759
00:41:25.121 --> 00:41:28.690
you're wearing fucking leather shoes.
Do Desert.
Those are leather.
I go,

760
00:41:28.691 --> 00:41:32.620
do you eat meat?
He goes,
killed a cow for that.
Exactly.
He goes,
I do eat me.

761
00:41:32.621 --> 00:41:34.490
But I just think bears are different.
I go different.
How?

762
00:41:34.491 --> 00:41:37.010
Because they're not in your neighborhood.
Like what are you talking about?

763
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:38.390
It's an animal.

764
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:43.430
Do you understand that anything that a hunter kills lives an infinitely better

765
00:41:43.431 --> 00:41:46.880
life than anything you're buying at Mcdonald's than anything you're wearing on

766
00:41:46.881 --> 00:41:47.481
your clothes?

767
00:41:47.481 --> 00:41:51.290
And he and his shoes and he leather and he belt that you have those animals

768
00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:54.980
lived lives of unimaginable suffering.
For the most part,

769
00:41:55.190 --> 00:42:00.060
those domesticated animals that are done that they're used for,
you know,

770
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.340
whatever it's for clothing or for,
you know,

771
00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.370
leather goods or couches or shit like that.

772
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.900
Those fucking things live in pens and their,

773
00:42:07.901 --> 00:42:11.840
their lives from birth to death or just for utility.
They're just,

774
00:42:11.841 --> 00:42:15.890
they serve a purpose.
They're there.
There are a commodity.
When you're hunting,

775
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:19.580
you're taking an animal that lives in an entirely natural life.

776
00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:23.960
You dip into that natural world,
harvest that animal,
pull it out,

777
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:28.820
and in my opinion,
that's infinitely better,
infinitely better in every way.

778
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.820
First of all,
the animal,
they're not going to live forever.
It's not like,

779
00:42:31.821 --> 00:42:32.061
you know,

780
00:42:32.061 --> 00:42:34.850
you're taking away an animal that was going to cure cancer if he kept it alive.

781
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.300
You know that animal was on its way to fucking building a rocket to go to the

782
00:42:38.301 --> 00:42:42.050
moon and you stepped in and shot it.
Now they're fucking bears,
man.
There bears,

783
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:47.060
they're eating each other's cubs and it's really good meat and it's good for

784
00:42:47.061 --> 00:42:51.260
you.
And the the,
the fact that people have a problem with hunters,

785
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:55.370
but they don't have a problem with passing by every restaurant you drive down

786
00:42:55.371 --> 00:42:58.880
the street,
every restaurant is filled with meat.
Every one of them,

787
00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:02.090
every supermarket filled with meat.
All these people you drive,

788
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:04.610
half of them are driving cars with leather seats.

789
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.790
Half of them are wearing leather shoes,
probably more than half.

790
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.280
But yet people have a problem with hunting.

791
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.520
And it's this weird thing because they don't see the death of the animal,

792
00:43:15.771 --> 00:43:16.940
the cause,
their cheeseburger.

793
00:43:16.941 --> 00:43:21.470
Because society is structured in a way that you can just without participating

794
00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:22.730
in the animal's death at all,

795
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.730
you can reap the benefits of it by just giving a little piece of paper and

796
00:43:25.731 --> 00:43:27.950
getting a cheeseburger.
And that's your connection to it.

797
00:43:27.951 --> 00:43:30.680
You can eliminate some of yourself from some of the guilt because you didn't

798
00:43:30.681 --> 00:43:34.340
kill it,
you know,
and you didn't see it get killed.
So therefore it didn't happen.

799
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.900
Yeah.
Yeah.
And people that eat meat have sent this to me and I'm like,
man,

800
00:43:38.901 --> 00:43:42.400
you got to rearrange the way you think you should expose you.
I'm I,

801
00:43:42.401 --> 00:43:45.380
I've told several people that have a problem with it that eat meat.
I'm like,

802
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:48.800
you should expose yourself to the death of an animal just to decide whether or

803
00:43:48.801 --> 00:43:50.330
not you want to continue eating meat.

804
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.390
Because that was a concern when I went hunting for the first time,

805
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.250
like I had been fishing my whole life,

806
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:59.270
so I've killed things before and eating them,
but I've never killed an animal.

807
00:43:59.271 --> 00:44:01.580
I was like,
man,
a deer is a big,
beautiful animal.
I mean,

808
00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:04.040
that's going to freak me out.
Maybe I'm not going to like it.

809
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.050
Maybe I'll be a vegetarian.
After that.
I was like,

810
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.910
I was really wondering what it was going to be like.

811
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:11.000
The exact opposite happened didn't bother me at all.
I mean,

812
00:44:11.001 --> 00:44:12.920
I thought it was great.
I mean it was,

813
00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:17.960
there was a moment of sadness at this animal died,
but the food was delicious.

814
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:22.520
The meat was delicious.
The,
the,
the experience was exhilarating.
It was exciting.

815
00:44:22.521 --> 00:44:26.430
It was fun.
It was wild.
It was enriching and it's the,

816
00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.310
the healthiest meat you can get.

817
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:32.530
And I think the most ethical way acquire it.
You,

818
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.310
you're responsible for what you're eating.

819
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.880
And there's something super satisfying about that.
Whenever I,

820
00:44:38.881 --> 00:44:41.780
I'm not at all the time,
but a lot of times when I,
uh,

821
00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:46.830
I tweet photos of like wild game that I cook and when I'm like out there and I'm

822
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:51.660
grilling something that I killed and I chopped up and I'm putting it on the

823
00:44:51.661 --> 00:44:55.170
grill and then I'm eating it.
Like it's just such a different experience.

824
00:44:55.171 --> 00:44:55.580
Like the,

825
00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:59.970
the feeling of it is so much better than just getting a steak from the grocery

826
00:44:59.971 --> 00:45:01.710
store,
throwing it on the grill and eating it.

827
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.600
There's nothing there with that pound for pound,
it's,

828
00:45:04.601 --> 00:45:08.410
it's a hell of a lot more expensive.
But that's not,
you know,

829
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:10.230
that's not what it's,
that's not what it's about.

830
00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:12.240
And it's one of those things where it's like super,

831
00:45:12.241 --> 00:45:15.150
super hard to explain to people when they're like,
well,
why do you want,

832
00:45:15.151 --> 00:45:18.870
and even my wife,
you know,
she's,
she's not into hunting.
She never wants to be,

833
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.800
she doesn't understand how I can love animals so much and yet go out and kill

834
00:45:22.801 --> 00:45:23.634
them and all that.

835
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:27.210
But it's one of those things that there's so many different facets as you can go

836
00:45:27.211 --> 00:45:29.130
down.
While they were doing it for food,
we're doing it for this,

837
00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:32.700
we're doing it for a population in general.
We're doing it for,
you know,
whatever,

838
00:45:32.701 --> 00:45:37.290
for sports,
which I don't,
I don't look at hunting as a sport per se,

839
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:39.810
but there's a lot of different things,

840
00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:42.090
elements that you can bring into it to explain to somebody.

841
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.730
And at the end of the day,
I looked at it,
I'm like,
I don't know why I do.

842
00:45:44.731 --> 00:45:49.120
I'm just,
I'm a man.
You know,
I'm like,
I posted a picture of the other day on,

843
00:45:49.121 --> 00:45:49.831
on Instagram.

844
00:45:49.831 --> 00:45:54.831
That's like a lot of these hunting groups classify themselves as predators or as

845
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:57.210
you know,
addicts or junkies or you know,

846
00:45:57.211 --> 00:46:00.720
I'm an Antler junkier or I'm this or I'm of that.
And it's like I'm a man,

847
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.690
you know,
God put man on this earth to till and to take care of it.

848
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:07.770
And he gave us sustenance and he gave us an ability to sustain not only

849
00:46:07.771 --> 00:46:10.620
ourselves,
but to grow population.
You know,
that's what,

850
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:14.490
that's what Adam and eve were the were there if you're a religious person or

851
00:46:14.491 --> 00:46:17.280
whatever,
but if you really believe Adam and eve,

852
00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:21.000
everybody came from,
which is pretty fucking ridiculous.

853
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:25.850
So I just happened to be a believer in Ebony.
But anyway,

854
00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.460
do you believe that there was two people and then everybody came from those two

855
00:46:29.461 --> 00:46:33.090
people in a way?
Yeah.
Really.
I think there's,
I think that,

856
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:38.630
I definitely think that there's a lot to specific religions that are out there,

857
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:41.940
that there's pieces there that,
you know,

858
00:46:41.941 --> 00:46:45.210
if you follow the Bible word for word for what it says,

859
00:46:45.211 --> 00:46:48.810
like literally there's a lot of stuff that's,
there's no way.
I mean,
it's like,
no,

860
00:46:48.811 --> 00:46:50.910
those are probably made up stores where,
but there's other things that I,

861
00:46:50.911 --> 00:46:54.780
you know,
I'm a religious person and I believe in God and,
and,
uh,

862
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.430
I think there's a lot of things that people have twisted.
No doubt,

863
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:00.410
no doubt.
But,

864
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:04.720
but I'm a believer there's something to all religions that um,

865
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:05.640
I think there's like,

866
00:47:05.641 --> 00:47:09.570
there's some universal truths and there's universal truths about treating people

867
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:14.370
certain ways and there's universal truths about seeking the good in life and you

868
00:47:14.371 --> 00:47:16.800
know,
looking out for your brothers and sisters.

869
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:21.800
And I think all of that came from understanding that people developed over time,

870
00:47:21.811 --> 00:47:24.780
wisdom that people developed over time.
And then this,

871
00:47:24.781 --> 00:47:29.781
this is connecting to what is universally good about the world life with few

872
00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:33.440
exceptions,
people generally,
and there's,

873
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:36.340
there are exceptions that people generally want to do good.

874
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:39.850
People generally want to be happy,
you know,

875
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.210
they generally understand consequence,
they understand right and wrong.

876
00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:46.220
There are exceptions,
you know,
just don't understand it.
That again,

877
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.760
and then there's people that have callous themselves one way or the other.

878
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:53.110
Either they toe the line a hundred percent religious and everything is literal

879
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.790
or they go the other direction.
Yeah.

880
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:59.800
The problem with the literal translations that the,
that wasn't English,
you know,

881
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.950
I mean,
we were,
we still there,
they're still working on the Dead Sea Scrolls,

882
00:48:02.951 --> 00:48:05.050
which is the oldest version of the Bible,

883
00:48:05.051 --> 00:48:08.260
which is an Aramaic and it's on animal skins.
And they have to,

884
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:12.250
they literally have to do DNA analysis on the animal skins to make sure that

885
00:48:12.251 --> 00:48:14.830
when they line up the pieces that trying to piece them all together,

886
00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:19.210
that it's the right animal.
Like,
like the way they do the,
the Dead Sea Scrolls.

887
00:48:19.211 --> 00:48:23.550
Have you ever paid attention to it?
I know I'm one of those is like,
I dunno,

888
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:28.090
it's like,
I don't know,
some of those things are so hard to even get into,

889
00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:31.180
but if you want to be a religious person,
that's the source of it.

890
00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.150
That's the source of almost all biblical stories is the Dead Sea Scrolls,

891
00:48:34.151 --> 00:48:36.220
you know?
And um,
what's,

892
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:39.520
what's really unique about it is that it was found in Qumran,

893
00:48:39.521 --> 00:48:42.010
I think in the 1940s.
They found these,
um,

894
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:47.050
these clay pots and inside these clay pots were essentially these animal skins

895
00:48:47.051 --> 00:48:49.360
that have been wrapped up.
And you know these,

896
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:53.980
these cylinders and these like wrapped up in roles and they had to unravel them

897
00:48:53.981 --> 00:48:56.920
and a lot of them were broken up.
And so the broken up ones,

898
00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:01.330
the way they do the DNA test that they do a DNA test.
So they say,
okay,

899
00:49:01.331 --> 00:49:05.410
well all animal,
all of the pieces from this animal we'll put over here,

900
00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:08.650
all the pieces from that animal,
we're assuming that's a different piece of skin.

901
00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.700
We'll put that over here.

902
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:14.920
And then there have to like try to piece it together like this ancient puzzle.

903
00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:18.730
Then they have to take Aramaic and translate it into English.

904
00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:23.000
And that's even older than the ancient Hebrew version of the Bible.

905
00:49:23.001 --> 00:49:23.970
And the ancient Hebrew book.

906
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:27.730
The weirdest thing about the ancient Hebrew version is that apparently ancient

907
00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:31.210
Hebrew didn't have numbers.
So letters were also numbers.

908
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:36.140
So the letter a was also the number one.
And like if I said Tim Burnett,

909
00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:40.420
your,
there's numbers to your name that like it also,

910
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.140
it counts in the trends,
not to translation,
but what the meaning of the word,

911
00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:49.170
like the word love and the word God have the same numerical value in ancient

912
00:49:49.241 --> 00:49:50.920
Hebrew,
and this is on purpose.

913
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:56.100
It's like things have like value and the sentences have like a numerical value

914
00:49:56.801 --> 00:50:00.760
to them that aren't our brains the way we think,
the way we talk,

915
00:50:00.761 --> 00:50:02.800
because we have numbers separate from words.

916
00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:07.510
I don't think we totally grasp what a lot of the meaning of a lot of the

917
00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:11.440
sentences were.
Then on top of that,
like a lot of those words in ancient Hebrew,

918
00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:13.480
there's something like 25% of them,

919
00:50:13.481 --> 00:50:15.340
they still don't even know what the fuck it was.

920
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:20.580
There's a massive amount of interpretation that they have to figure out.

921
00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:25.330
Then they take that and take it from there and translated to Greek into Latin,

922
00:50:25.331 --> 00:50:30.290
and then from that to English.
So when you're reading about Adam and eve,

923
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.970
who the fuck knows what the original meaning was?
What were they trying to say?

924
00:50:34.971 --> 00:50:38.780
The original human beings that God created or that the universe bestowed upon

925
00:50:38.781 --> 00:50:41.610
the earth.
What,
what was that?
What,
what do they do?

926
00:50:41.611 --> 00:50:44.780
They really mean that it was just two people.
It's so hard to tell.

927
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:47.220
And when you add in all the other fuckery,
uh,

928
00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.640
the ones where you know that somebody had a grip on it.

929
00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.900
Somebody we know about Constantine and the bishops and how they,

930
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:57.350
they rewrote the,
the new testament and they left out a bunch of shit.

931
00:50:57.351 --> 00:50:57.741
Like they had,

932
00:50:57.741 --> 00:51:01.850
they chose what was going to be in the Bible are not bunch of people chose what

933
00:51:01.851 --> 00:51:04.970
was going to be the word of God.
People that had no contact with God.

934
00:51:04.971 --> 00:51:08.180
It's not like God came down and he gave him a fucking to do lists,

935
00:51:08.181 --> 00:51:10.180
like get all this shit done and then I'll,

936
00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:14.300
I'll double check your work and then I'll be back.
Now there was,
they decided.

937
00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:17.800
So I'm not opposed to the concept of God and I'm,

938
00:51:17.801 --> 00:51:20.690
I'm not an anti religious person at all.
Um,

939
00:51:20.691 --> 00:51:22.220
I think religion is not a lot of good.

940
00:51:22.221 --> 00:51:25.880
I think religion is a good foundation for a lot of people to develop morals and

941
00:51:25.881 --> 00:51:27.430
ethics and I just,

942
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:30.770
whenever anybody wants to talk about like literal translations of stuff,

943
00:51:30.771 --> 00:51:35.120
I'm like,
and I always want to know like how much did you look into it?

944
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:38.240
Like how when you say literal translation,
like did you,

945
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:41.730
did you go to the actual source of those stories because you got to go to

946
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:45.620
fucking the epic of Gilgamesh.
If you want to really know the Noah's Ark Story,

947
00:51:45.621 --> 00:51:49.120
that's the original version of it.
It's 6,000 years old.
I mean it's,
it's,

948
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:53.660
it's written with these little lines and shit like on clay tablets.

949
00:51:53.661 --> 00:51:56.150
Like that's the oldest version of that story.

950
00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:00.740
Probably based on some real shit that happened probably based on real floods.

951
00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:03.030
<v 2>Yeah.
My brother,
he just,
what he was telling me the other day,</v>

952
00:52:03.031 --> 00:52:06.420
he watched that Noah movie,
how would this terrible,
he was like,
man,

953
00:52:06.421 --> 00:52:09.330
that was the worst.
That wasn't even close.
But then he's like,
well,

954
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.310
there were giants in the Bible,
so maybe,

955
00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:14.010
maybe I haven't seen the movie so I don't have a clue.
But he's like,
yeah,

956
00:52:14.011 --> 00:52:16.770
it was so weird and everything.
But yeah,
it's,

957
00:52:16.771 --> 00:52:18.510
the problem is people are full of shit.

958
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.570
All I know is I guarantee that if there was a,
that Noah,

959
00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.680
he probably found a chicken and,
and it,

960
00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.850
he probably ended up eating at one sometime and he's like,
yeah,
that tastes good.

961
00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:27.630
You know,

962
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:30.480
I'm gonna eat chicken and I'm going to raise the chickens and then there's going

963
00:52:30.481 --> 00:52:31.620
to be more chickens.
And then he's like,
well,

964
00:52:31.621 --> 00:52:35.070
if a chicken tastes good then this sheep over here's got to taste good.
You know?

965
00:52:35.071 --> 00:52:39.510
And so I just continued on,
well,
how the fuck did all the animals get to them?

966
00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:42.490
That's the biggest one.
They have to walk there from all over the earth,

967
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:45.780
the now road.
How convenient.

968
00:52:45.781 --> 00:52:48.330
That's one thing that's kind of cool about your podcast is the ones that I

969
00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:49.620
listened to and everything.
It's like,

970
00:52:49.621 --> 00:52:52.800
what I like about you is when you bring in different coasts in different guests,

971
00:52:52.801 --> 00:52:55.860
a lot of them have completely opposite backgrounds and what I have and probably

972
00:52:55.861 --> 00:52:56.820
from what you have to,

973
00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:00.030
but I like that you're fascinated by a lot of different things and that's,

974
00:53:00.031 --> 00:53:02.250
you take yourself and just like you're saying there,

975
00:53:02.251 --> 00:53:06.000
the research is you'll immerse yourself into really knowing and finding

976
00:53:06.001 --> 00:53:10.320
something out.
And uh,
you find a lot of different things.
Fascinating.

977
00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:14.220
And one thing that's really cool when you're talking about the hunting and when

978
00:53:14.221 --> 00:53:14.851
you were first,

979
00:53:14.851 --> 00:53:18.930
when you first did a podcast with Rinella and then you kind of were educating

980
00:53:18.931 --> 00:53:21.630
yourself along the way as you got into the hunting part of it,

981
00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:23.300
it was almost like,
it's,

982
00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:26.000
and I don't know if you've gone back and listened to of your old podcast

983
00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:28.440
<v 0>when you did those,
but it's like,
it was like a little kid,
you know,</v>

984
00:53:28.441 --> 00:53:31.290
just learning something new.
And I'm like,
that's pretty cool,
you know,

985
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:32.940
because here you have a,
you know,

986
00:53:32.941 --> 00:53:37.170
a grown man asking questions that my 10 year old's asking me,
Daddy,

987
00:53:37.171 --> 00:53:41.280
why are you doing this?
And this or that.
I'm like,
I dunno.
Ask Rogan.

988
00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:46.800
I'm like that with you though.
Yeah.
Mark's like,
ah,
but it's uh,
you know,
it's,

989
00:53:46.801 --> 00:53:48.570
it's,
it's,
it's cool to see,

990
00:53:48.571 --> 00:53:50.340
and that's one of the questions that I had for you is it's like,
well,

991
00:53:50.341 --> 00:53:53.130
what got you into hunting?
Why did you want to start hunting?
Well,

992
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:57.120
my wife would be best able to answer that because she's been mocking me for

993
00:53:57.121 --> 00:53:59.640
watching Ted Nugent,
spirit of the wild for the past.

994
00:53:59.641 --> 00:54:02.910
Like I mock you for watching til 11,
12 plus years.

995
00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:06.000
I watch it for a lot of reasons.
One of it,

996
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:09.600
one of it is because it is fucking unbelievably hokey.
I mean,

997
00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:14.310
he's just a hokey dude.
He's a crate.
He's a,
a master showman,

998
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:18.270
you know?
And if you've ever seen Ted Nugent play guitar,
ever seen his band,

999
00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:23.660
he's a master showman and he uses a lot of that showmanship on his show.

1000
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:27.690
And you know,
some of it is like really ridiculous.
You know,

1001
00:54:27.691 --> 00:54:31.350
some of it is like rare,
very repetitive and very over the top.

1002
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:36.300
But I was fascinated by his promotion of this lifestyle,
this hunting lifestyle.

1003
00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:39.360
You know,
he has a,
at the time he didn't have the place in Texas.

1004
00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:42.840
He had his place in Michigan is a high fence operation and he would just kind to

1005
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:44.940
go out into,
I don't know,
any hundreds of acres.

1006
00:54:44.941 --> 00:54:47.850
He has set up tree stands and wait for deer and shoot them.

1007
00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:49.170
And that's all the meat that he ate,

1008
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:53.130
donated it to hunters for the homeless and hunters for the hungry or whatever it

1009
00:54:53.131 --> 00:54:54.420
is and you know,

1010
00:54:54.421 --> 00:54:58.890
and it really constantly promoted how healthy the lifestyle is,

1011
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:02.190
how healthy the meat is and how this is like,

1012
00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:05.610
this is about sustainability.
This is about,

1013
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:10.640
these animals are providing him with sustenance and in turn he is providing,

1014
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:15.960
um,
he puts up food plots.
He's planting trees.
Like his whole thing is,

1015
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:21.230
it's very balanced in a way that a lot of people who eat organic food that they

1016
00:55:22.351 --> 00:55:27.090
buy at whole foods and they think they're being all earthy life.
Mine too,

1017
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:28.441
you're not,

1018
00:55:28.441 --> 00:55:33.120
you're not really balanced like Ted Nugent living in Michigan is more balanced

1019
00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:36.240
than you.
I know you don't think that,
but that's the reality.

1020
00:55:36.241 --> 00:55:39.660
The reality for a lot of people that go to the grocery store and pick up their

1021
00:55:39.661 --> 00:55:41.160
organic food is like,
man,

1022
00:55:41.161 --> 00:55:44.970
you don't know how many people were involved in the creating of that food.
What,

1023
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:49.170
what,
what,
what was putting in the soil?
It's organic.

1024
00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:51.060
There's no pesticides allegedly,

1025
00:55:51.061 --> 00:55:55.110
but it's organic because some inspectors stamped at the sand.
It is the organic.

1026
00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:58.560
Okay.
You don't use this pesticide which you used this chemical so,
but it's okay.

1027
00:55:58.561 --> 00:56:02.520
It's organic.
Yeah.
The word organic is a weird word to it's,
it's too open ended.

1028
00:56:02.521 --> 00:56:04.140
I just,
I don't market it.
Yeah.
I don't,

1029
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:08.400
I don't know the exact definition of organic groceries are,

1030
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:12.120
but there's a difference between groceries that you buy and groceries that you

1031
00:56:12.121 --> 00:56:15.380
grow and I grow a lot of vegetables now and um,

1032
00:56:15.381 --> 00:56:19.170
I've been doing that over the last say,
year and a half,
two years.
And again,

1033
00:56:19.171 --> 00:56:23.470
it's something super fucking satisfying about plucking it tomato slicing and

1034
00:56:23.471 --> 00:56:26.830
eating it in cooking.
You know,
putting in a salad tomato that you grow,

1035
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:31.000
you put that seed in there,
you water it,
it grew,
you plucked it.

1036
00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:34.090
It's the whole cycle.
The whole cycle comes together.

1037
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:39.330
So I started watching that show and I'm from then I just had got one of these

1038
00:56:40.421 --> 00:56:43.690
days I want to fucking go hunting.
And then I started watching Rinella show.

1039
00:56:43.691 --> 00:56:47.890
I was watching all kinds of hunting shows for like a decade before I ever went

1040
00:56:47.891 --> 00:56:49.030
hunting dog.
Gotcha.
Yeah.

1041
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:51.610
People would come over my house and look at my DVR and we were like,

1042
00:56:51.611 --> 00:56:56.300
what the fuck is wrong with you?
Y'All morbid,
you get this weird twisted.
Yeah.

1043
00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:59.320
When animals attack kickboxing,

1044
00:56:59.321 --> 00:57:03.490
MMA hunting shows like what the fuck is wrong with you?
I don't know.

1045
00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.310
I don't know what's wrong with me,
but that's how I got into it.

1046
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:09.100
So until I met Rinella,
I never actually went hunting.
Right.

1047
00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:13.810
The hunt you did with him?
Was it Alaska or something to carry first one?
No,

1048
00:57:13.811 --> 00:57:18.580
the first one was a mule deer in Montana.
Okay.
We went to,

1049
00:57:18.581 --> 00:57:23.080
um,
the,
uh,
the Missouri River.
We did a float trip.

1050
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.120
It was really fun.

1051
00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.300
<v 2>I remember seeing something on the sportsman channel was touting the crap out of</v>

1052
00:57:27.301 --> 00:57:30.390
that.
They're like meat eater,
you know,
Joe Rogan goes on,
meteor does this.

1053
00:57:30.391 --> 00:57:34.530
And I'm like,
who's Joe Rogan?
I know me neither is,

1054
00:57:34.531 --> 00:57:37.050
but I didn't know who Joe Rogan was and I didn't know what the big deal about it

1055
00:57:37.051 --> 00:57:40.440
was.
And then I watched the episode,
I'm like,
I guys,
it seems pretty funny,

1056
00:57:40.441 --> 00:57:44.310
you know,
whatever.
And then it wasn't until like mark when,
I mean,

1057
00:57:44.311 --> 00:57:47.250
this wasn't very long ago.
I'll be,
I'll had been,
I haven't,
I haven't.

1058
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:48.263
And I'm like,

1059
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:50.970
I got to get to know more of this Joe Rogan cause he's getting into hunting,

1060
00:57:50.971 --> 00:57:53.640
you know,
he's doing stuff with Rinella now.
All the sudden shoot,

1061
00:57:53.641 --> 00:57:55.620
he's doing a podcast with cam and it's like,
okay,

1062
00:57:55.621 --> 00:57:59.130
I got to get to get to know this a little bit more.
And because I'll be honest,

1063
00:57:59.131 --> 00:58:00.210
I was like Brogan,

1064
00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:05.360
he could have been jungle or an acrobat as far as I had no idea.

1065
00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:08.900
No idea.
You're a totally immersed in the hunting world.
Well that's your worlds.

1066
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:09.691
What's funny to you?

1067
00:58:09.691 --> 00:58:13.590
You asked me the last time I've watched a meat eater episode two years ago,

1068
00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:17.310
year and a half ago.
I don't know.
I just,
I've watched one episode of uncharted,

1069
00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:21.840
you know,
I just don't watch the shows anymore because I don't know.

1070
00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:25.440
I'm making them,
I guess help me still watching busy too.
Yeah.

1071
00:58:25.441 --> 00:58:29.370
It's not that I'm that busy.
I mean,
I definitely am busy,

1072
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:31.740
but I have my home life too.
You know?
I spent a lot of time at home,

1073
00:58:31.741 --> 00:58:35.070
but I just don't spend it watching TV anymore.
I used to a lot.
I used to,

1074
00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:37.230
I mean when I first started producing television,

1075
00:58:37.231 --> 00:58:39.150
I would watch all the top rated shows.
I'm like,
oh,

1076
00:58:39.151 --> 00:58:40.920
I don't know what else is doing.
I want to know what Lee and Tiffany,

1077
00:58:40.921 --> 00:58:43.410
I want to know what all these people are doing and I'm going to do it because

1078
00:58:43.411 --> 00:58:45.240
it's successful.
It's a format.

1079
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:49.800
And then I started solo and it was like all everything went out the window.

1080
00:58:49.801 --> 00:58:50.371
It's like,
you know what?

1081
00:58:50.371 --> 00:58:53.850
I'm going to do everything to these people don't do because I'm sick of seeing

1082
00:58:53.851 --> 00:58:55.170
the exact same thing every time.

1083
00:58:55.171 --> 00:58:58.770
And this conversation out of conversation with a big sponsor the other day

1084
00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:02.580
because they're wanting to produce a TV show and we had a big conference call

1085
00:59:02.581 --> 00:59:05.310
and everybody was talking about all the things they hate about television and

1086
00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:06.900
what things that they like about television.

1087
00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:09.810
And a lot of these different shows came up and then without a doubt they're all

1088
00:59:09.811 --> 00:59:11.010
like,
we hate out hokey.
It is.

1089
00:59:11.011 --> 00:59:13.660
We had how overproduced it is and this and that and that and,

1090
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.320
but at the end of the day,
something's got to die,
you know,
and it's like

1091
00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:19.110
everything is the same.

1092
00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:21.920
The comments that you get from people as all the hunting shows the same,

1093
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.100
you know?
And so to do something different is really hard.

1094
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:27.050
Well there are a lot of them that are saying,

1095
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.320
there's so many shows out there right now because of the networks that are,

1096
00:59:30.321 --> 00:59:32.840
that are available that there's a lot of shows that are different.

1097
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:35.390
A lot of shows that,
that,
you know,

1098
00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:37.790
have their heartland bowhunter pretty different.
Yeah.

1099
00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.290
Are shows that have their own brand,
you know,

1100
00:59:39.291 --> 00:59:41.290
a lot of people emulate and try to copy what,

1101
00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.340
what heartland bow on her started and what they've done.

1102
00:59:43.341 --> 00:59:46.550
And so you're starting to see a lot of that imagery and that type of shooting

1103
00:59:46.551 --> 00:59:49.760
into different productions.
And I,
you know,
I,
I'll be admit,

1104
00:59:49.761 --> 00:59:51.950
I fall into a lot of that too,
where it's like,
man,

1105
00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:54.980
I want to do a shot that looks like that,
but I want to do it my way,
right.

1106
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:57.000
For ours,
for Solo,
what,

1107
00:59:57.001 --> 01:00:00.190
what I think makes it unique is the fact that no matter how we film it,

1108
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:03.200
it doesn't really matter because at the end of the day,
we're one man out there.

1109
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.880
We're trying to kill an animal,
we're going to kill it,

1110
01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:06.020
we're going to bring it home,
you know,

1111
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.060
and we're just trying to document that adventure.

1112
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:11.480
I think by doing it by ourselves and having that relationship with the camera

1113
01:00:11.481 --> 01:00:15.230
where everything seems to be so close up and like,
it's like I'm talking to you,

1114
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.130
you know,
you're,
you're watching,

1115
01:00:16.131 --> 01:00:18.020
I'm trying to talk to the viewer and communicate that.

1116
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:22.700
And that's really hard to do because sometimes you want to just reenact and

1117
01:00:22.701 --> 01:00:26.810
restate what's happening or what's going on or what you're gonna do.
But what,

1118
01:00:26.811 --> 01:00:28.500
what mark and I are working on with,

1119
01:00:28.501 --> 01:00:31.370
with some of these other projects and what we're going to try to bring into solo

1120
01:00:31.371 --> 01:00:35.150
is more of that,
uh,
more of that.
What's going on up here.
You know,

1121
01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:38.420
what's going on in my head more so than what's going on with this.

1122
01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.710
You're seeing people want to know more what I'm thinking while I'm doing certain

1123
01:00:42.711 --> 01:00:45.860
things than actually what I'm doing,
I think.

1124
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:47.900
And so that's an element from a,

1125
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:52.340
as a producer to try to bring into it to where if people really knew what goes

1126
01:00:52.341 --> 01:00:53.840
on in my head while I'm up on the mountain,

1127
01:00:53.841 --> 01:00:57.650
I think they'd be shocked because it's not,
you know,
it's not all,

1128
01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.760
it's not all just complete focus on,
on hiking and hunting and killing,
you know,

1129
01:01:01.761 --> 01:01:02.960
there's a lot of different things that go on,

1130
01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:06.160
meaning that like you start thinking about your families,

1131
01:01:06.161 --> 01:01:09.860
start thinking about your life.
Well,
that kind of thing.
Yeah.
That,
and it's like,

1132
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:15.260
you know,
I may,
I may be sitting there one time,
I may be thinking,
you know,

1133
01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:17.840
I'm going home,
I've been up here for four days.

1134
01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:22.160
I haven't seen a damn antler to Antler antlered animal for the last four days.

1135
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:26.000
I'm going home.
But you have this,
you know,
this,

1136
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.570
all this interaction that goes on in my head is like the guilt.
Okay,

1137
01:01:29.571 --> 01:01:30.404
if I go home,

1138
01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:34.100
I've just wasted four days that I've got here that I should have been here to

1139
01:01:34.101 --> 01:01:37.820
potentially get an episode,
you know,
or two potentially harvest an animal,

1140
01:01:37.821 --> 01:01:40.460
bring it home to eat it.
You know,
I'm,
I'm wasting that.

1141
01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.490
If I go home now I'm a quitter.
If I stay at,
stick it out.

1142
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.310
I'm stupid because I'm not gonna find any animals or whatever.

1143
01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:48.800
So there's this constant,
because when you're by yourself,

1144
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:51.320
there's nobody to talk you into things and there's nobody to talk to you out of

1145
01:01:51.321 --> 01:01:54.020
things.
So when you make a decision,
it's yours and you got to live with it.

1146
01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.460
You got to do it,
you know?

1147
01:01:55.461 --> 01:02:00.461
So if I'm hiking up a mountain and a deer is bedded somewhere and I know that if

1148
01:02:01.101 --> 01:02:04.790
I hike around this way two miles,
I can get to him without him winning me.

1149
01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:09.800
Or like I did on the last day of my hunt,
I took it.
I said,
yeah,
it's a gamble.

1150
01:02:09.801 --> 01:02:13.520
The wind's blown here.
If I go here,
it's,
it's,
it's iffy.
But if I go here,
I can,

1151
01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:15.740
it's,
I can cut off two miles of distance,

1152
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:19.890
but I might have a chance to get on him.
But if I go this way,
it's two miles.

1153
01:02:19.891 --> 01:02:22.350
But it's a guarantee I could get it on him without the wind.
Well,

1154
01:02:22.351 --> 01:02:25.140
the last day I chose the shortcut and what did I do?
I blew the deer out.

1155
01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:28.200
You know,
the deer,
the deer caught my scent and it was gone.
You know,

1156
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.890
one thing that works for covering sent,

1157
01:02:30.891 --> 01:02:34.320
cause you were using some stuff on the episode that I saw last week where you

1158
01:02:34.321 --> 01:02:38.370
were,
that knows blocker.
I tried that nose jammer stuff.

1159
01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:42.300
That stuff's different.
I guess.
I'm not as,
I'm not a cent guy.

1160
01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.910
I'm not a cover Sant guy.
I'm not a,
you don't believe in it.

1161
01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:49.770
I don't think they're trying to convince me this that works and it may work.

1162
01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:53.610
But there was an instance on that episode because I don't want to down talk nose

1163
01:02:53.611 --> 01:02:57.380
jammer,
you know,
because they're,
they're,

1164
01:02:57.450 --> 01:03:02.040
they're advertising on the show but it's not,
it's a product that I taught.

1165
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.630
I committed to him when I met the owner,

1166
01:03:03.631 --> 01:03:07.770
I met John Redmond at a trade show and in Reno and he was so stinking passionate

1167
01:03:07.771 --> 01:03:10.350
about it and I told him to his face,
I'm like,
John,
I don't believe in that stuff,

1168
01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:14.210
man.
It's all hokey.
It's smells,
smells funny.
I don't want anything to smell.

1169
01:03:14.211 --> 01:03:17.970
And he's like,
no,
try it,
blah blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
So it turns out I,

1170
01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.820
he gives me a candidate stuff and I try it there in Oklahoma.

1171
01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.290
That's the first time I'd ever tried it.

1172
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:26.160
And there was a buck that came down wind and he obviously smelled something.

1173
01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:28.350
Yeah,
you could tell.
He was like,
yeah,
he's like,

1174
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:31.920
that was awesome because I was like,
cause he smelling.
But you know what?

1175
01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:36.090
The deer could have done that by smelling me or he was smelling the vanilla that

1176
01:03:36.091 --> 01:03:37.890
I just rubbed it all over the tree or whatever that was,

1177
01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:41.400
whatever's in the nose jammer.
But something confused his sensory glance.

1178
01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:44.850
And that's the point behind nose jammer I guess as the tenant Kinda confused

1179
01:03:44.851 --> 01:03:48.330
their sensory glands.
So it just pauses them just for that one minute.

1180
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:51.180
So hopefully you can get a shot at him.
But it did it,

1181
01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.670
it held that deer up and then he,
then he moved on.
So there was,

1182
01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.490
there's some validity to that to that I guess.

1183
01:03:57.150 --> 01:04:00.520
But would that deer have done the same thing if I rubbed coconut oil on,

1184
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:03.960
on my pants,
you know,
who knows?
I don't know.
Right.
How could you tell?

1185
01:04:03.961 --> 01:04:07.450
You'd have to have the exact same scenario with the exact same animal and a

1186
01:04:07.451 --> 01:04:10.800
bunch of different options.
And that's why for me personally,

1187
01:04:10.801 --> 01:04:14.730
I've had so much experience in the field and then I've had so many times when

1188
01:04:14.731 --> 01:04:17.760
I've tried different things and times when I've just gone natural,
you know,

1189
01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.800
where it's just me and my body odor or that's it.

1190
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.990
And ultimately at the end of the day,

1191
01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:24.650
my conclusion has been in it and it is to today to,

1192
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.150
and that's not to say that it's can't change over time.
And as I,

1193
01:04:27.151 --> 01:04:29.250
as I have more hunting experiences,

1194
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:32.940
but right now I don't want to interject any foreigns scent into the air.

1195
01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:36.600
You know,
I want,
I'm going to have a smell to me.
No matter what I do,

1196
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:39.780
no matter what I shower in,
no matter what I spray my clothes down with,

1197
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.333
doesn't matter.

1198
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:45.090
I'm going to smell a certain way that is not natural to that environment.

1199
01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.860
So when that deer walks into his bedroom,
because a deer,

1200
01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:52.620
a deer is never anywhere by chance.
He's never anywhere randomly.
He's,

1201
01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:55.410
he's walking where he's walking for a reason,
you know,

1202
01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:58.510
he knows that that's a safety corridor where he can transfer,

1203
01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:02.670
where he can move himself from food to bed or whatever safely.

1204
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.990
And so he's there for a reason.

1205
01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.830
So if he smells anything out of the ordinary or sees anything out of the

1206
01:05:07.831 --> 01:05:09.660
ordinary,
he's automatically going to be on alert.

1207
01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.670
And you know that there's variations to everything because crop land and where

1208
01:05:14.671 --> 01:05:15.660
you hunt some of these white tails,

1209
01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:19.420
it's farm land where I hunt there in Oklahoma,
it's an operating cattle ranch.

1210
01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:21.790
So the deer could have smelled people before had to have,

1211
01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:25.120
because there's oil rigs in there where there's people in and out.

1212
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:29.350
So they know what people smell like.
So to me,
I use that into my,

1213
01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:33.220
into my little thinking is that if they know what human smell,

1214
01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:35.830
like they want to avoid it.

1215
01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:39.250
So they're traveling these corridors because they know they can avoid humans.

1216
01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:41.880
So they're just traveling where he's traveling because he knows he's not going

1217
01:05:41.881 --> 01:05:45.790
to have any interaction with,
with anything but a deer.
Right.
So to me,

1218
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:46.810
I use that as well.

1219
01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:50.350
That's the point where I want to be and I want to get to so I can kill him,

1220
01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:53.320
you know?
So if he smells anything,
guys,
getting back to the same thing,

1221
01:05:53.321 --> 01:05:57.250
if he smells anything out of the ordinary,
it's,
you're the gigs up anyway.

1222
01:05:57.251 --> 01:06:01.930
So in deer having insane capability,
oh yeah.
For Smell,
right?
Yeah.

1223
01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:06.670
Yeah.
I mean,
you're,
they say,
I don't know the exact numbers.
I mean,

1224
01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:09.160
I'm not a technical guy.
I'm more of a live in the now,
you know,

1225
01:06:09.161 --> 01:06:11.500
feel how I feel kind of kind of person.
So,
you know,

1226
01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:16.390
I've had experiences where a deer has been thousand 1500 yards down wind and he

1227
01:06:16.391 --> 01:06:17.950
smells me.
It blows me away.

1228
01:06:17.951 --> 01:06:20.980
It's like that theory is 1500 yards away from me and he smells me and he takes

1229
01:06:20.981 --> 01:06:24.670
out because in the West you can see that,
you can see what goes on.

1230
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.580
So when you're sneaking around and you see that deer poke his head up and you

1231
01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:31.570
know,
you,
you know,
when they're smelling and they're gone,
if they smell you,

1232
01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:33.940
they're out of there.
But you know,
when I was hunting this year,

1233
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.370
there's several times where I bumped these two big bucks.

1234
01:06:36.371 --> 01:06:37.630
I bumped him three different times.

1235
01:06:37.631 --> 01:06:41.300
The first two times they just saw me and they didn't smell me and they just kind

1236
01:06:41.301 --> 01:06:44.600
of moseyed off.
They were like,
something's,
something's weird over there.
You know,

1237
01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:46.420
it's that Bush isn't supposed to be moving like that.

1238
01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.810
But then the one time that they smelled me,
they didn't see me.

1239
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.030
They just smelled me and they were gone.
I mean,
they booked it.
They,

1240
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.610
they smell your breath.
Like what are they smelling?
Yeah,

1241
01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:58.720
I'd do everything for it in the woods,
don't you?
I mean,
well there's,
there's,

1242
01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:02.350
it depends,
it's breath,
but,
but it's,
it's,
we have a sense,
you know,

1243
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:05.950
I just smell myself right now sitting here,
but it's like we have it,

1244
01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:09.130
we have an aroma about us just like they have an aroma about them,
you know,

1245
01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:12.850
so you could wash your clothes in the San free stuff,
you spray,
whatever.

1246
01:07:12.851 --> 01:07:15.260
But you know,
30 minutes into a hike,
I'm,

1247
01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.890
I'm sweating and smelling like you swells.
You know,

1248
01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:24.930
you could maybe eliminate the very outskirts of their ability where they even

1249
01:07:26.261 --> 01:07:30.670
tried.
Just play the wind.
Well,
I mean,
and that's hard too because it's like,

1250
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.900
you know,
there's millions of dollars advertising dollars spent in promoting,

1251
01:07:34.901 --> 01:07:36.710
sent elimination products and a lot of,

1252
01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.300
some of my sponsors promotes sent elimination clothing or whatever.

1253
01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:44.680
And at the end of the day,
all that stuff can help.
It can eliminate,

1254
01:07:44.681 --> 01:07:48.550
like you're saying,
it can take your,
your scent Roma from here to here,

1255
01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:52.780
which is good.
That's your advantage.
But what about those things,

1256
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:56.800
those ozone things that people picking on me for that I don't know was zonnic I

1257
01:07:56.801 --> 01:07:59.730
dealt with those on with water but I dunno.
I Dunno.

1258
01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:03.460
It was at the giant box sits above your crease Stan.

1259
01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:05.430
Does it play music cause it like to need like yeah.

1260
01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:09.410
Muzak somethings like elevator music to calm them down and put some

1261
01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.280
air cleaner thing.
It's the ozone and it puts out,

1262
01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.590
which I'm experienced with ozone with water when I worked with her for a water

1263
01:08:18.591 --> 01:08:23.060
company is the ozone is a,
it's a form of sanitize,
sanitize.
It keeps,

1264
01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.700
it keeps the lines clean and it keeps,
it keeps everything clean.

1265
01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:29.630
So I guess if you inject that into the air and you can smell ozone like after a

1266
01:08:29.631 --> 01:08:32.990
good heavy rainstorm or something,
you can smell the ozone in the air.

1267
01:08:32.991 --> 01:08:37.010
You can smell this,
smell it.
The ozone from the ozone layer.
From the,
yeah,

1268
01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:41.420
from just from the environment.
Your hands.
Yeah,
it disables the ions.

1269
01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:44.270
And does something.
Yeah.
Um,
you can get them for your house.

1270
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:47.930
I know people that have gotten in their house and it lowers the dust levels.

1271
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:51.500
Allergens really paralyzes it.
Brings it right to,
yeah,

1272
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:55.220
but isn't ozone toxic in hive?
Yeah.

1273
01:08:55.221 --> 01:08:57.380
You can get yourself pretty sick from it if you,

1274
01:08:57.530 --> 01:09:00.980
so if you're just sitting in a tree stand blowing ozone on your face.

1275
01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.110
I can't speak to it.
To me.
I Dunno man.

1276
01:09:03.111 --> 01:09:05.450
That's one more thing that I got off the tree.
I don't,

1277
01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:08.000
I'm never going to use one.
I mean,
they could come to me and say,
Hey,

1278
01:09:08.001 --> 01:09:11.240
we'll give you 50 grand to use this thing.
I'll be like,
I'll take your 50 grand,

1279
01:09:11.241 --> 01:09:16.190
but I can't use it.
Wow.
How rude saying this,
our podcasts,
ladies and gentlemen,

1280
01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:21.290
you know.
Well good for y'all.
Straight,
honest.
No.
I've turned down,

1281
01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:25.260
I had a sponsorship at one time with a scent elimination company and they wanted

1282
01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:26.860
to grow that sponsorship.
They,

1283
01:09:26.861 --> 01:09:29.780
of course there was other pretends to a to move to another network and different

1284
01:09:29.781 --> 01:09:32.400
things.
And I ended up turning that down because it's,

1285
01:09:32.530 --> 01:09:34.640
it's f and I told him exactly,
I'm like,

1286
01:09:34.641 --> 01:09:37.910
this is not a product that I can get behind 100% and if I can't,

1287
01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.750
if I can't believe in what it is that people are gonna see right through that.

1288
01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:45.350
So for me it's like that money that you're going to give me,
it does.
Does,

1289
01:09:45.570 --> 01:09:49.910
does this both no good.
So I discontinued that relationship with that sponsor.

1290
01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:53.250
Yeah.
I feel the same way about sponsors for the podcast.
I,

1291
01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:56.690
I've turned down a bunch.
I've turned down one recently.
It was pretty lucrative,

1292
01:09:56.691 --> 01:09:59.480
but I be like,
I don't like it.
I don't like what they're selling.

1293
01:09:59.481 --> 01:10:03.110
I don't like the idea not doing it.
And I'm with the TV show,
some of it,
you know,

1294
01:10:03.111 --> 01:10:04.730
you see some of the ads or the,

1295
01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.800
the billboards that are running in the show and everything.

1296
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:10.700
What a person's got to realize too from a production standpoint is is we have

1297
01:10:10.701 --> 01:10:14.150
sponsors,
you know,
quote unquote sponsors that we are backing under armor,

1298
01:10:14.151 --> 01:10:18.530
you know,
prime g five all these that that our backers and investors,

1299
01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.900
yeah,
they're pretty much investors in the,

1300
01:10:20.901 --> 01:10:24.590
in you and in your business and your brand,
and then there's ads that you sell,

1301
01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.620
you know,
32nd commercial spots,
those types of things.

1302
01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:31.330
That's ad placement that either the network's going to put in there or I'm going

1303
01:10:31.331 --> 01:10:33.590
to sell it to somebody to put it in there.
Yeah,
that's a,

1304
01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.710
maybe you be understand how outdoor show your work.

1305
01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:40.070
The outdoor shows work a little bit different than a lot of their shows.

1306
01:10:40.071 --> 01:10:45.071
A lot of times they get like say if a guy puts on a show like solo hunter,

1307
01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.970
you have a certain amount of advertising space that's for you,
for your program,

1308
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.080
but then the network has a certain amount of advertising space of their own for

1309
01:10:54.081 --> 01:10:54.651
their things.

1310
01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:59.651
Like I got to tell Rinella about an advertiser that was competing with one of

1311
01:11:00.321 --> 01:11:03.130
his friend's companies that was on the same Chicago.

1312
01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:06.800
Do you know that you guys are selling this on your show you those what we're

1313
01:11:06.801 --> 01:11:09.680
selling that I go,
yeah,
your show had an ad for this,

1314
01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:14.090
which is a rip off because they didn't protect the category.
Yeah,
exactly.

1315
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:16.920
For like under Armour and some of these other,
these the major sponsors,

1316
01:11:16.921 --> 01:11:18.090
you protect categories.

1317
01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:22.200
So when somebody buys a commercial spot on the show for say that's protected,

1318
01:11:22.201 --> 01:11:26.100
I'm not going to go out and find another clothing guy,
can't sponsor any of that.

1319
01:11:26.101 --> 01:11:29.490
I'm,
I'm exclusive for these guys.
And so yeah,
that makes sense.

1320
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:33.140
So it's for folks who don't know what you're exactly how you're saying it's,

1321
01:11:33.141 --> 01:11:37.440
it's a kind of a unique thing.
You kind of buying time on a,
on a,
on the network.

1322
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:40.740
That's one thing I tell people you know,
is,
is there's no rule book,

1323
01:11:40.741 --> 01:11:44.070
but there's no playbook either.
So the networks,
there's a lot of variations.

1324
01:11:44.071 --> 01:11:46.980
You know,
the majority of hunting shows out there,
they're called time bias,

1325
01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:51.900
where we,
by the time we buy that 30 minute block on the network and then we,

1326
01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:55.650
we buy a certain amount of advertising and we sell that advertising.

1327
01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.890
And then whatever advertising we don't buy from the network because it within a

1328
01:11:58.891 --> 01:12:02.070
30 minute or 30 minute block,

1329
01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:05.220
you have six minutes of commercial time.
So it's,
it's three,

1330
01:12:05.221 --> 01:12:06.510
two minute commercial breaks.

1331
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:10.680
So whether I buy any of those commercial times are not outdoor channels going to

1332
01:12:10.681 --> 01:12:14.160
put in three,
two minute breaks into that,
that programming.

1333
01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.890
So my 30 minutes turns into 22 minutes,
you know.

1334
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:21.990
So what I do is I buy however many 32nd commercial spots I can sell.

1335
01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:25.710
I buy that from the network,
I turn around and sell that a margin.

1336
01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:28.590
Then within the show content,
there's,
you know,

1337
01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:32.130
I get paid to where somebody is hat I get paid to where somebody's shirt.

1338
01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:33.360
You know,
if I use a product,

1339
01:12:33.361 --> 01:12:37.020
I get paid and there's different ad placements in there and so it becomes more

1340
01:12:37.021 --> 01:12:41.280
of,
people think that it's all about hunting.
Hunting's the fun part,
you know?

1341
01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.500
But for me,
the business is the fun part too.
So you're,

1342
01:12:43.501 --> 01:12:46.620
you're trying to calculate in that 30 minutes,
how can I maximize,

1343
01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:49.680
maximize my revenue,
you know,
because you can only have,

1344
01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:52.830
you have a limited number of,
of advertising spots that you can put in there.

1345
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.330
So it's who can I,
who can I contract and who's who,

1346
01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.020
who can we fit in certain places?

1347
01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:00.690
It's a very interesting way to produce television.

1348
01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.490
A lot of folks aren't aware of.

1349
01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:06.780
It's cool in a way because there are shows on the hunting television that are

1350
01:13:06.781 --> 01:13:10.980
more like discovery channel where the network pays for them to be produced and

1351
01:13:10.981 --> 01:13:13.050
they actually own the content.
They're called outdoor channel.

1352
01:13:13.051 --> 01:13:15.300
Originals were on sportsman channel,
I don't know what they're called,

1353
01:13:15.301 --> 01:13:19.230
whatever more the network is invested into these shows or they'd give them the,

1354
01:13:19.231 --> 01:13:20.880
our time for certain.
There's,
there's,

1355
01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:23.190
there's a myriad of ways things can be done,

1356
01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:25.920
but I want to own at the end of the day,

1357
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:29.310
I want to own solo hunter and I want to own timber net.
I want all my brand,

1358
01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:32.580
you know,
I don't want,
just because they're buying the show off me,

1359
01:13:32.581 --> 01:13:36.060
I don't want to have them have any control over me or what I do or what I say or

1360
01:13:36.061 --> 01:13:38.820
what advertisers I can bring in.
So at the end of the day,
yeah,
I'm,

1361
01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:43.200
I'm having to front some money and run it as a business rather than somebody's

1362
01:13:43.201 --> 01:13:45.930
paying me to produce a show.
But at the end of the day,

1363
01:13:45.931 --> 01:13:47.370
there's no limit to what I can make.
You know,

1364
01:13:47.371 --> 01:13:50.970
there's no limit to the advertising that I can sell and I own myself.

1365
01:13:50.971 --> 01:13:52.290
I own the shell on the brand.

1366
01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:56.160
Are you aware of this whole sort of movement that's going on right now on

1367
01:13:56.161 --> 01:13:57.690
television,
on regular television,

1368
01:13:57.691 --> 01:14:00.690
like the history channel and a lot of these other channels where they're really

1369
01:14:00.691 --> 01:14:04.840
concentrating on people that are trying to live sustainable lives?
Yeah,

1370
01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:09.090
like the Alaska shows like Alaska last frontier or,
um,

1371
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:12.070
there's that other show life below zero.
You ever seen that show?

1372
01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:15.630
<v 0>It's a good show.
It's a lot of,
a lot of it is hunting and uh,</v>

1373
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:20.170
I follow that stuff probably more than I do in the hunting industry because to

1374
01:14:20.171 --> 01:14:21.990
me that's,
it's obviously mainstream,

1375
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.730
but it's more fascinating because you don't have

1376
01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.490
individual little guys like me conceptualizing and coming up with the content.

1377
01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:34.600
You have big boys in big rooms making big decisions with big,
big checks,

1378
01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:38.800
doing big analysis on viewership and on what people are looking for and all
that.

1379
01:14:39.010 --> 01:14:41.650
You have them creating the concepts and the ideas.

1380
01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:44.770
So to me it's like those are the people I want wanna I want to watch because

1381
01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:49.150
those are the people with the brains and the backing behind them knowing with

1382
01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:51.670
the,
with their hand on the pulse of what society is looking for.

1383
01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:55.450
So I follow the allegedly allegedly,
which,
you know,
yeah,

1384
01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:58.990
I mean most of the time they just TV fuckheads the hard thing with that is,

1385
01:14:58.991 --> 01:15:02.230
is like,
you know,
there's a larger part of society that are non hunters,

1386
01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:05.310
non outdoors when there are that are,
you know,
outdoorsman puts,

1387
01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.000
you're starting to see a lot of content,
you know,

1388
01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:08.920
people trying to portray that lifestyle.
Yeah.

1389
01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:11.710
That's why I asked you because I think it's,
uh,
there's,

1390
01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:16.660
there's this movement right now,
uh,
and you see it in like weird ways.

1391
01:15:16.661 --> 01:15:18.760
Like you see it like preppers.
I'm like,
Oh,

1392
01:15:18.761 --> 01:15:21.880
I have these weird people that are like canning foods and digging holes in their

1393
01:15:21.881 --> 01:15:26.650
backyard and burned water bottles.
They can dumps in coffee cans,
whatever.
Well,

1394
01:15:26.651 --> 01:15:28.330
preppers,
it's weird,
you know,

1395
01:15:28.331 --> 01:15:32.200
because some of them were like living in cities and they're putting all this

1396
01:15:32.201 --> 01:15:34.690
stuff together and you know,
I kinda got news for you.

1397
01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:37.450
If you're living in a city and the shit hits the fan,

1398
01:15:37.451 --> 01:15:40.090
you better get the fuck out of that city.
That's what I told my wife.
I'm like,

1399
01:15:40.091 --> 01:15:44.260
you know,
a lot.
I'm flying through Vegas into La on nine 11 it's like,
ah,

1400
01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:46.600
there's nowhere to go.
Like I don't know how you guys do it down here.

1401
01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:49.470
There's nowhere to escape.
You don't know where I'm at.
I'm like,
okay,

1402
01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:52.450
I have the back door gone.
Middle of the Nevada desert,
you'll have,

1403
01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:56.330
you'll never find me.
But here it's like,
man,
you can't.
Well,

1404
01:15:56.331 --> 01:15:57.460
it's going to be also,

1405
01:15:57.490 --> 01:16:00.250
you're going to be surrounded by a bunch of people who don't have any food,

1406
01:16:00.251 --> 01:16:02.740
who don't have any water here and they're going to find out that you have food

1407
01:16:02.741 --> 01:16:06.150
and water.
You better have a lot of bullets and fucking Adderall to stay away.

1408
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:09.550
Don't let people know you've got a year supply of food.
Yeah,

1409
01:16:09.551 --> 01:16:11.140
don't get on a prepper show,

1410
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:14.290
but it shows the fuck in front of your house and all your neighbors know where

1411
01:16:14.291 --> 01:16:18.220
your stored food is.
Crap hits the fan.
There's a lot of us that are in trouble.

1412
01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:21.660
Ultimately society is going to have to bond together.
And those though,

1413
01:16:21.670 --> 01:16:23.290
that's where,
that's where religion,

1414
01:16:23.291 --> 01:16:25.570
a lot of these groups will come together and that's where it will become

1415
01:16:25.571 --> 01:16:28.710
valuable.
And you know,
for,
for people that don't see it as like,

1416
01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.360
that's where little groups,
communities,
you know,

1417
01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.100
it's where if you don't know your neighbor man,

1418
01:16:33.101 --> 01:16:35.500
you should go your stinking neighbor because the guy might be in,

1419
01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:38.340
my guy might be covering your back one night,
you know,
maybe.

1420
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:41.920
So you need to know your area and you know,
yeah,
it's the fan.

1421
01:16:41.921 --> 01:16:44.050
We're all screwed anyways.
Yeah.
You're almost like,

1422
01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.750
I was listened to this other show that I've listened to all the time called

1423
01:16:46.751 --> 01:16:50.600
radio lab,
uh,
is a podcast and they were talking about,
uh,
the,

1424
01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:54.640
the impact that killed the dinosaurs.
And uh,
when they were talking about it,

1425
01:16:54.641 --> 01:16:55.780
it was like,
dude,

1426
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:59.740
you're just going over like what the original human was like this thing that

1427
01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:03.430
allegedly came out of that impact,

1428
01:17:03.730 --> 01:17:06.040
like what animals,
what fossils they know of.

1429
01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.730
And it's almost like you rather get hit in the head by the,

1430
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.060
I then go through all that shit.
I know,
you know,

1431
01:17:11.061 --> 01:17:15.050
you don't want to be the people that have babies in,

1432
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:18.950
in a pop apocalyptic environment and then those babies grow onto it.

1433
01:17:18.951 --> 01:17:23.120
Like fuck man,
be glad you live in an era where they could make cotton really,

1434
01:17:23.121 --> 01:17:24.920
really soft us.
You know,

1435
01:17:24.921 --> 01:17:28.400
he got soft blankets and warm heat and you don't have to deal with,

1436
01:17:28.401 --> 01:17:31.520
I'm a big fan of civilization but I am a big fan of this.

1437
01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:35.270
Well we were talking about the prepper thing because I think there's this,

1438
01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:40.730
people are sort of realizing as people pay more attention to a lot of the issues

1439
01:17:40.731 --> 01:17:44.480
that society has,
whether it's a environmental issues like um,

1440
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:49.660
whether it's pollution or garbage is being dumped into the ocean or the amount

1441
01:17:50.841 --> 01:17:53.870
of a fish that's getting pulled out of the ocean sustainability.

1442
01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:57.120
And they start looking at the ideas of like where their food comes from.

1443
01:17:57.130 --> 01:18:01.100
Like people are really into grass fed beef now.
Grass Fed beef is a big thing.

1444
01:18:01.101 --> 01:18:05.570
It was fucking nonexistent 10 years ago.
You never saw grass fed beef anywhere.

1445
01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:10.220
Almost every supermarket I go to now it has like a little section grass fed
meat,

1446
01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:10.851
you know,

1447
01:18:10.851 --> 01:18:14.240
and people were concerned about animals that are eating what they're supposed to

1448
01:18:14.241 --> 01:18:19.160
be eating instead of some weird fucking great news for people is beef.
You know,

1449
01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:22.510
being here in the West,
you know,
we see a lot of that and uh,

1450
01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:27.320
the majority of its life is grass fed.
They turn them out on the range they pay,

1451
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:30.140
they pay fees for the Blm or wherever is there.

1452
01:18:30.141 --> 01:18:33.350
Grass fed up until about three months at the end of their life where they're put

1453
01:18:33.351 --> 01:18:35.570
onto a feed lot,
fed a bunch of fat foods fattened up.

1454
01:18:35.571 --> 01:18:38.600
So they taste good when I put them on the grill,
you know what I mean?
That's,

1455
01:18:38.601 --> 01:18:43.430
there's a reason why,
in my opinion,
why food's been engineered and,

1456
01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:46.730
and changed is because it makes them,

1457
01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:50.510
we've got a lot of pop,
a lot of people to feed for one,

1458
01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:55.400
but so in a way that's good,
but as long as I can go out and distill,

1459
01:18:55.401 --> 01:18:58.490
obtain a deer tag or an elk tag and go out and get my own meat for myself,

1460
01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:01.640
I'm going to continue to do that.
You know,
it's just,

1461
01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:05.370
it's a totally different kind of meat.
That was the,
the point is that the,

1462
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:10.100
when you eat a steak from an elk or a deer and then you eat a steak from a cow,

1463
01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:14.360
like one of them is a fat,
Lazy Fuck.
That's like,
like marbling.

1464
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:18.210
Like that Shit's not supposed to be their taste.
So good.
Well,

1465
01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:23.060
I had a rib eye last night.
A bone in Ribeye.
Oh,
it's delicious.

1466
01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:25.820
I'm sure it was not fucking grass fed whatsoever.

1467
01:19:25.821 --> 01:19:30.460
Partner and saw grass probably never feared for his life either.
Oh,

1468
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:33.230
probably not to the end.
It didn't even know the end.
You know,

1469
01:19:33.231 --> 01:19:36.200
the axe fell and I don't think it's an ax.
I don't know what it is.

1470
01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:40.790
A Piston Histon what it is that thing like uh,
no country for old men,

1471
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:44.720
that thing he uses that just take a ride foreheads then they take a ride and go.

1472
01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:49.700
I remember in high school I watched a video on uh,
on the butchering process,

1473
01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:52.370
you know,
and uh,
that made me sick when,
when they,

1474
01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:55.940
when they killed the cow made me,
made me sick after that,

1475
01:19:55.941 --> 01:19:58.760
it wasn't that big of a deal,
you know,
cause I've dealt with that before.

1476
01:19:58.761 --> 01:20:02.720
But what's weird is when they do it kosher style like kosher,

1477
01:20:02.721 --> 01:20:05.870
you have to cut its throat and it suffers way more.

1478
01:20:06.670 --> 01:20:08.040
It's very strange.
Like they

1479
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.780
<v 2>have rules and a lot of the rules are,
we're like old school religious rules.</v>

1480
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:15.030
Like the reason why you're not supposed to eat pigs once because a lot of pigs

1481
01:20:15.031 --> 01:20:17.820
carry trick analysis.
That's what they did back in the day at least.

1482
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.120
And so they were telling people don't eat pigs.
Why?
Because people eat pigs.

1483
01:20:21.121 --> 01:20:23.520
They got really fucking sick.
So they wrote it down.

1484
01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:26.250
Don't eat pigs against the religion.
I grew up,
you know what I mean?

1485
01:20:26.251 --> 01:20:29.190
You talk about organic.
Can you talk about raw,
I mean,

1486
01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:33.890
the way I grew up is probably about as organic and raw as you can get.

1487
01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:36.960
I mean whole milk straight from the cow.
You milk the cow.
I'd take it in,

1488
01:20:36.961 --> 01:20:41.280
strain it through a cloth,
you know,
a cloth,
chill it,

1489
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:46.020
skim the cream off or shake it in and you drink it,
you know,
no pasteurization,

1490
01:20:46.021 --> 01:20:47.730
nothing.
That's how,
that's how I grew up.

1491
01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:52.500
There was a time there when when my dad was a farmer and he lost the farm so he

1492
01:20:52.501 --> 01:20:53.400
had to go back to college.

1493
01:20:53.401 --> 01:20:57.990
Well there was a big time stretch in there where we had to sustain off the land.

1494
01:20:57.991 --> 01:21:01.000
You know her off of the farm.
We had animals to eat and you know,

1495
01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:04.260
the farmers would come and drop off a sack of potatoes because they knew that,

1496
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:06.350
you know,
these,
those little raggedy kids,
you know,

1497
01:21:06.351 --> 01:21:09.320
all their dad's off go on to college and mom was trying to take care of them
and,

1498
01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.560
and so we literally lived off the land.
So your dad was somewhere else.

1499
01:21:13.561 --> 01:21:15.810
And you were on the phone.
I went to college in Provo,

1500
01:21:15.811 --> 01:21:18.600
Utah while we lived in central Idaho.
You know,
cause he was,

1501
01:21:18.610 --> 01:21:22.940
went back to school to get his teaching degree because we lost the farm now,
um,

1502
01:21:23.730 --> 01:21:25.470
me,
he was a potato farmer for a long time.

1503
01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:28.530
So we're living on the farm and it wasn't,

1504
01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:33.560
it wasn't unusual for mom to go out grab one of the rabbits that we're raising

1505
01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:38.190
and I'll never forget the first rabbit,
you know,
that I've washed,

1506
01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:41.680
washed her kill,
hung it up,
smacked it on the head.
And you know,
we,

1507
01:21:41.681 --> 01:21:45.150
we had rabbit for dinner and it was,
there was a lot of times where it's like,

1508
01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:48.480
Timothy,
can you go grab a chicken?
You know,
we need,
we need some,

1509
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:51.750
we need dinner or whatever.
And you'd go out and you'd get a chicken and you,

1510
01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.070
you take care of it and bring it in.
You know,
there,

1511
01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:58.920
it's just part of the lifestyle that I grew up that you didn't go to the grocery

1512
01:21:58.921 --> 01:22:02.280
store and get things.
You went out to the garden and you pulled off a Zucchini,

1513
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:03.870
you know,
you went and pulled some tomatoes.

1514
01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:07.980
You what was really cool as the irrigation system that was there,

1515
01:22:07.981 --> 01:22:12.000
the little ditches,
I mean asparagus everywhere,
wild rhubarb.

1516
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:16.080
I mean there's all these different kinds of things that we probably did out of

1517
01:22:16.081 --> 01:22:19.080
necessity during that time span.
More so than out of,
yeah,

1518
01:22:19.081 --> 01:22:21.510
we're going to live off of our farm and live off of what we create.

1519
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:27.110
But I think that timespan taught me a lot about the reality of life and death.

1520
01:22:27.421 --> 01:22:32.250
The reality of hey,
you can create and be so completely self sustained,
you know,

1521
01:22:32.251 --> 01:22:34.830
you can be create your own food,

1522
01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:39.300
everything right here just on one tiny little farm.
And then also,
you know,

1523
01:22:39.301 --> 01:22:39.760
that's,

1524
01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:44.760
that's what kind of gave me a love and a passion with animals because you're

1525
01:22:44.791 --> 01:22:48.510
raising,
you know,
a calf from the time it's born,

1526
01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:53.570
you're bottle feeding it,
you're feeding it all through,
through the wintertime,

1527
01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.040
you know,
breaking the ice off the water trough and everything else.

1528
01:22:56.370 --> 01:22:59.880
The next spring you're killing it and then you're going to eat it.
You know?

1529
01:22:59.881 --> 01:23:04.170
So there's that,
that whole span where you go from life to death in a five,
six,

1530
01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.190
eight month period of,
and

1531
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:10.810
<v 0>as a young kid that could be either traumatic or that can be a major life</v>

1532
01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.700
learning experience.
You know?

1533
01:23:13.210 --> 01:23:16.840
And I took that as this is the way life is.
That's the way,

1534
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:19.120
that's the way things happen.
So when I grew up,

1535
01:23:19.121 --> 01:23:22.580
when you get older and you get to college and people start throwing the Ah,
you,

1536
01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.550
you know,
you eat animals or this and that and,

1537
01:23:24.551 --> 01:23:27.250
and the vegetarian stuff and you start learning the things of the world.

1538
01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:30.670
That's where it's like,
man,
you people are the ones that are crazy,
not me.

1539
01:23:30.850 --> 01:23:31.880
You know?
Yeah.

1540
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:35.500
There's just so much ignorance involved in people that live in cities and you

1541
01:23:35.501 --> 01:23:39.310
know,
claim that there's something wrong with people that eat animals.

1542
01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:43.900
It's the,
the,
the,
what's wrong is factory farming there.

1543
01:23:43.930 --> 01:23:45.670
There's something wrong about factory farms.

1544
01:23:45.671 --> 01:23:48.750
There's something wrong about jamming a bunch of chickens into a box.

1545
01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:51.460
It's so small they can't move and they cut their beaks off so they don't peck

1546
01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:52.400
each other.
Do they have?

1547
01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:55.780
That's the thing is do they have to do that in order to provide enough food for

1548
01:23:55.781 --> 01:23:56.860
people?
That's,
that's right.
I don't know.

1549
01:23:56.861 --> 01:23:59.200
That's where I'm ignorant on the subject because it's like,
man,

1550
01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:02.380
part of it is like,
well,
we got to produce food.
We've got to have GMOs,

1551
01:24:02.381 --> 01:24:03.730
we got to have grain grow faster.

1552
01:24:03.731 --> 01:24:07.110
We got to have these different things just to provide food for people.

1553
01:24:07.111 --> 01:24:09.520
There's so many,
because we're providing food for people all over the world,

1554
01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:12.940
so it's like,
Dang,
where's the fine line there?
You know,
where's,

1555
01:24:12.941 --> 01:24:16.760
where's the good point?
I just think that the ethics involved in,

1556
01:24:16.761 --> 01:24:19.510
in raising animals,
I think it is important.
It is,

1557
01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:24.400
and it's important that these animals don't suffer needlessly,

1558
01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:29.050
but the idea that eating them is wrong.
It's like,
boy,

1559
01:24:29.051 --> 01:24:32.950
there's some weird,
it's,
it's a very shallow minded argument in my opinion,

1560
01:24:32.951 --> 01:24:35.620
or the,
not shallow minded,
but the,
the,

1561
01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:40.870
the exploration of that idea,
the exploration of that idea is,

1562
01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:45.880
it's kind of simplistic because if you just let the animals free,
okay.
No more,

1563
01:24:45.881 --> 01:24:47.650
no more livestock,
no more of this.
Well,

1564
01:24:47.651 --> 01:24:49.060
what are you gonna do with all those animals?

1565
01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:52.000
You can just let them roam free and if you let them roam free,

1566
01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:53.650
how are you planning on driving anywhere?

1567
01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:55.550
Because if you're planning on going play,

1568
01:24:55.670 --> 01:24:58.470
if you want to keep them penned up and you want to keep feeding them and they

1569
01:24:58.480 --> 01:24:59.860
just not eat them,
okay,

1570
01:25:00.090 --> 01:25:02.380
well what are you going to do when there's too many of them?
Well,

1571
01:25:02.381 --> 01:25:04.550
there shouldn't have been that many to begin with,
you know?

1572
01:25:04.551 --> 01:25:08.020
Or it's because of the factory farming that there are that many pigs are that

1573
01:25:08.021 --> 01:25:11.680
many turkeys or whatever.
But do you know what they're doing in the Hamptons,

1574
01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:14.380
the Hamptons,
like a really rich area or on your,
your podcast.

1575
01:25:14.381 --> 01:25:15.880
That's the first time I heard about that.

1576
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:19.540
They're trying to give them birth control to try and give dear birth control.

1577
01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:23.920
I mean hundreds of hours they doing it.
Are they doing it right now?

1578
01:25:23.921 --> 01:25:26.860
Shut the fuck is wrong with these babies.
There's control in certain cities.

1579
01:25:26.861 --> 01:25:30.250
I think birth control,
it's like,
you know,

1580
01:25:30.251 --> 01:25:34.690
it's a 22 cent three away out of that.
I mean that's birth control,
right,

1581
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:40.140
or arrows.
I mean,
and one of the shows,
uh,
Waddell and um,
uh,

1582
01:25:40.150 --> 01:25:43.870
that dude never own,
never heard of it.
He knows guys,
never heard of them.
They uh,

1583
01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:44.860
went to uh,

1584
01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:49.900
New Jersey and they were in like this residential neighborhood in New Jersey

1585
01:25:49.901 --> 01:25:51.430
that has a deer problem.

1586
01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:55.380
So they were like posted up on these tree stands and these people's backyards

1587
01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:59.680
just fucking deer everywhere.
These guys,
he'd mark here grew up in New York?

1588
01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:04.240
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
So that places mobbed Mario dear.

1589
01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:06.050
<v 2>Yeah.
You can't even drive at night.
Yeah.</v>

1590
01:26:06.051 --> 01:26:09.410
So then what they do is they shut down the parks and they allow you to go and

1591
01:26:09.411 --> 01:26:13.420
after all the gear season's done and you're allowed to take up to five dear.
Wow.

1592
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:17.270
It's so controlled that they want to know at the end of every day you have to

1593
01:26:17.271 --> 01:26:21.860
log on a piece of paper,
part of your license,
what you've seen and how many,

1594
01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:25.360
what are they were the guys in Boston,
like Mitch and Tim were,

1595
01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:27.940
they were showing me where they were hunting.
Right.
I went to visit my,

1596
01:26:28.150 --> 01:26:31.600
it was like five minutes away from New Plymouth Rock.
You know what?

1597
01:26:31.610 --> 01:26:34.760
All the hunting right there on the ocean and everything.
I was just like,
man,

1598
01:26:34.761 --> 01:26:35.594
that's crazy.

1599
01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:40.720
Just overwhelmed with like urban dear or suburban suburban dear.

1600
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:44.750
Yeah.
That's a big issue also with ticks because those deer,

1601
01:26:44.751 --> 01:26:47.420
the ones that are carrying those deer ticks and those are the ones that are

1602
01:26:47.421 --> 01:26:52.230
carrying that Lyme disease.
And my room substeps obsessed with ticks every,

1603
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:54.960
every time she talks to me on the phone.
Did you check yourself for ticks?
Nah,

1604
01:26:54.961 --> 01:26:58.280
babe,
I can't see that for yourself or take Rinella.

1605
01:26:58.281 --> 01:27:01.850
And His kid both got Lyme disease and every one of his producers never heard of

1606
01:27:01.851 --> 01:27:05.450
him.
He got uh,
he got it really bad though.

1607
01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:08.850
He had bell's Palsy.
I don't know if all of us said,
yeah,
that's crazy.

1608
01:27:08.851 --> 01:27:12.400
It was ugly.
But he was saying on the last podcast I did with them,
but they,

1609
01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:17.500
they did some study of ticks in the Hudson Valley and Valley county or

1610
01:27:18.891 --> 01:27:22.130
something.
Like 70 to 80% of them have Lyme disease.

1611
01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.800
It's a fucking epidemic.
That's crazy.
Well,

1612
01:27:24.801 --> 01:27:29.801
they had a stink in what's from a call it a burning man in Nevada out there.

1613
01:27:30.450 --> 01:27:35.310
I guess a bunch of people got not West Nile from the all the mosquito,
six gas,

1614
01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:39.420
16 to 23,000 people.
What came down with Wes?
Not yet.

1615
01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:41.870
All the more reason I got to go to burning man,

1616
01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:45.400
there's no need for any more reasons to not go to Berlin.

1617
01:27:45.570 --> 01:27:49.760
But if you did need one,
that's it.
If I go to burning man,
it's the handout soap.

1618
01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:53.320
I do find myself up on the mountain though sometimes.
You're like,
oh,

1619
01:27:53.321 --> 01:27:56.510
what if I got any ticks?
But you know,
I've never,
I mean there's,
when I,

1620
01:27:56.511 --> 01:27:59.090
that deer I shot last week,
holy cow.
Did you see the Cape?

1621
01:27:59.091 --> 01:28:03.530
There's ticks everywhere.
Just covered literally.
Just,
and what's crazy is when,

1622
01:28:03.531 --> 01:28:06.140
uh,
after the animal dies and you're,
you're,
you,

1623
01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:08.420
I brought it back and I kept it out and everything,
which is,

1624
01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:12.170
if you don't know what caping is,
is,
is when you take the hide for mounting,

1625
01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:15.320
you know,
so you take it off the head and neck and you bring it back Utan it.

1626
01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.970
And you have a mountain so you can preserve your,

1627
01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:20.240
whether it's a trophy or you can preserve your memories or whatever it is.

1628
01:28:20.241 --> 01:28:24.020
But once it dies and it goes through the cooling process,

1629
01:28:24.021 --> 01:28:26.780
the ticks note don't have anywhere warm to stay at anymore and there's no blood

1630
01:28:26.781 --> 01:28:30.240
and there's nothing.
So they just start coming out like crazy.
And uh,

1631
01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:35.030
I mean there was just this pile of ticks.
I was like,
man,
that's,
you kill him.

1632
01:28:35.031 --> 01:28:38.960
What do he do?
I just let them down.
You can't kill a tick.

1633
01:28:38.961 --> 01:28:42.320
I mean we used to on one,
we'd have sheep and stuff when we'd be on the farm.

1634
01:28:42.321 --> 01:28:45.170
You'd kind of roll your fingernail over and crush them and try to kill them.

1635
01:28:45.171 --> 01:28:48.520
But they're tough.
They're like a fleet.
Just don't get them on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're,

1636
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:53.030
they're bad.
They're Yucky.
I couldn't have Lyme disease.
I would never know.

1637
01:28:53.690 --> 01:28:57.320
I think you just start feeling like shit.
Some days you feel bad,

1638
01:28:57.321 --> 01:28:58.760
some days you could,
well,
they say that.

1639
01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:02.010
Do you remember were like in the eighties or nineties a

1640
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:05.010
<v 0>lot of people were coming down with chronic fatigue syndrome.</v>

1641
01:29:05.050 --> 01:29:08.280
They linked it to Lyme disease?
Is that what you're,
yeah,
people were saying,

1642
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:10.920
well there was,
it was a real issue like people saying,
oh you know,

1643
01:29:10.921 --> 01:29:13.980
my friend has chronic fatigue syndrome.
Like what does,
what does that mean?

1644
01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:16.380
Well sometimes people just get,
for whatever reason,

1645
01:29:16.381 --> 01:29:20.310
they're just tired all the time.
Their body aches or why they don't know.

1646
01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:24.540
Well now they believe that a lot of those people have Lyme disease because

1647
01:29:24.541 --> 01:29:29.070
apparently there's a lot of doctors to this day that are reluctant to diagnose

1648
01:29:29.071 --> 01:29:31.890
someone with Lyme disease.
And that's what Rinell ran into with his kid.

1649
01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:35.160
He was like,
I think my kids got Lyme disease.
And then doctors like,
ah,

1650
01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:38.370
don't worry about it.
It's nothing.
And then it turns out at he did and you know,

1651
01:29:38.371 --> 01:29:41.340
he was really fucking pissed off cause he brought his kid in there three times,

1652
01:29:41.341 --> 01:29:44.200
but they'll sure slap them on Ritalin in a hurry.
Oh Yeah,

1653
01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:46.470
put your kid on Prozac and it'll help us.

1654
01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.510
Like if I took my kid and they'd be like,
ah,

1655
01:29:48.511 --> 01:29:52.050
he's add you gotta you gotta calm that kid down.
I'm like,
Nah,
man,
he's a boy.

1656
01:29:52.051 --> 01:29:55.710
He's no burning man.
Was Not infected with West Nile virus.

1657
01:29:57.830 --> 01:30:01.190
What,
what happened?
That's the,
that's the Huffington Post.

1658
01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:04.260
I want to believe that in that area.
Yeah.
And some traps,

1659
01:30:04.261 --> 01:30:07.860
but it wasn't on any people or only one case in that county.

1660
01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:10.440
So that whole last five minutes of that segment,

1661
01:30:10.441 --> 01:30:13.080
there was so many people out there screaming,
you guys are wrong.

1662
01:30:13.081 --> 01:30:17.670
You're so full of crap.
Every podcast I've ever done ever.

1663
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:21.930
I got news every,
yeah.
It was no way around that.
It doesn't matter.

1664
01:30:21.931 --> 01:30:25.410
You just gotta do your thing.
I guess it's not 16,000.
It's zero,

1665
01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.790
close,
close mark.
But when you think about,
you know,

1666
01:30:30.810 --> 01:30:35.700
with 7 billion people on the planet,
you weren't
close enough.

1667
01:30:36.670 --> 01:30:41.280
Um,
so back to,
uh,
this,
uh,
this,
this movement,

1668
01:30:41.281 --> 01:30:43.320
this trend that people are having to sort of,

1669
01:30:43.690 --> 01:30:47.370
I think a lot of it comes with people that are kind of trying to shy away from

1670
01:30:47.371 --> 01:30:52.170
Gmo foods and these people that are trying to move towards sustainability.

1671
01:30:52.170 --> 01:30:55.730
And I think that's what's being reflected in a lot of these shows.
Um,

1672
01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:59.670
but I find it fascinating that people are really into these shows that have

1673
01:30:59.671 --> 01:31:03.510
never had any desire to hunt.
And they accept it.
Like,

1674
01:31:03.511 --> 01:31:05.700
especially like life below zero is a really good one.

1675
01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:08.520
And they accept how these people live because well,
hey,

1676
01:31:08.521 --> 01:31:11.190
those people live out in the bush,
they have no choice.

1677
01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:15.610
And it's a unique lifestyle choice instead of,
you know,

1678
01:31:15.630 --> 01:31:19.260
hey Tim Barnett likes to go out and shoot things and hunt them and film it.

1679
01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:22.710
But I feel like it's the same thing.
I really do.

1680
01:31:22.711 --> 01:31:24.330
I feel like it's exactly the same thing.

1681
01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:29.040
It's just they've stylistically labeled it in a different way and it became,

1682
01:31:29.041 --> 01:31:31.710
you know,
a reality show about unique people.

1683
01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:34.130
Does that mean I have to accept the Hippie,
you know,

1684
01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:36.570
that's out there humping like minks all over and you know,

1685
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:40.830
transmitting diseases everywhere because that's the lifestyle that they chose.

1686
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:45.160
You know,
so it's like the hump weeks humping like names,
I don't know,
whatever.

1687
01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:49.550
I'm just like the animal,
then you're ruining my example.
The sand,

1688
01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:53.250
just because they're saying that it's acceptable because those people

1689
01:31:53.251 --> 01:31:56.790
interjected there themselves into that lifestyle.
So it's like,
okay,

1690
01:31:56.791 --> 01:32:00.180
so the people that are living of,
you know,
whatever lifestyle,

1691
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:01.710
should I accept that?
Just because they're,

1692
01:32:01.711 --> 01:32:04.930
they're putting themselves into that lifestyle.
It's like,
I dunno.
Well,

1693
01:32:04.931 --> 01:32:07.600
I have no problem accepting any lifestyle.
It doesn't intrude on mine.

1694
01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:12.760
But when I see these,
um,
these reality shows,
whatever you want to call them,

1695
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:15.640
where these people are living a sustainable life,
I just,

1696
01:32:15.670 --> 01:32:19.630
I find it super intriguing,
like almost like in a primal way.

1697
01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:24.430
Like I love watching those shows.
I think it's,
there's,
um,
life below zero.

1698
01:32:24.431 --> 01:32:27.580
There's one guy,
I think his name is Glenn,
and uh,

1699
01:32:27.581 --> 01:32:30.560
he lives deep in the woods.
Okay.

1700
01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:33.100
He lives right next to this lake and uh,

1701
01:32:33.101 --> 01:32:37.390
he doesn't have any power is no,
he doesn't have a fucking snowmobile.

1702
01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:41.230
Like there's levels that these guys do it.
Some guys have snow.
Will is one guy,

1703
01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:45.550
Eric,
he has a snowmobile and he traps and hunts and he sells the,
you know,

1704
01:32:45.551 --> 01:32:49.120
the first and things along those lines.
And so he gets some money for that,

1705
01:32:49.121 --> 01:32:53.290
for supply.
And then he also guides,
he's a hunting gun.
But this other guy,
Glen,

1706
01:32:53.291 --> 01:32:54.730
he's not none of that.

1707
01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:58.570
I mean all he has some furs that he sells and with that the money,

1708
01:32:58.571 --> 01:33:01.840
he gets bullets and that's basically what he has 10 camp,
you know,

1709
01:33:02.170 --> 01:33:06.490
pots and pans and things along those lines for cooking.
But everything he does,

1710
01:33:06.491 --> 01:33:08.230
he's,
he's chopping his own wood.

1711
01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:11.290
He makes his own fire with like one of those things.

1712
01:33:11.290 --> 01:33:14.950
He puts like the piece in its mouth with the stick so he can hold it in place

1713
01:33:14.951 --> 01:33:17.350
and does the whole thing with the fucking,
with the,

1714
01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:20.800
it looks like one of those things you play the violin with,
you know,

1715
01:33:20.801 --> 01:33:23.770
like a fire go.
Yeah,
a fire fireball.
But he,

1716
01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:27.850
it's an old school one where he holds a piece in his mouth that it keeps a stick

1717
01:33:27.851 --> 01:33:32.260
in place so he could like,
he like got a boy both hands for them.
Exactly.

1718
01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:34.780
Said it really gets pushed down with one arm.

1719
01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:38.080
So he bites down on it with his teeth,

1720
01:33:38.170 --> 01:33:41.850
holds the stick in place and he can make a fire pretty quickly like that.

1721
01:33:41.851 --> 01:33:44.740
It was pretty interesting to watch,
but he said,
hey,
you know,

1722
01:33:44.741 --> 01:33:48.820
you could lose matches,
matches,
get wet this side,
I'll never lose.
So he's gone.

1723
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.380
So old school,

1724
01:33:50.410 --> 01:33:55.300
like come as as old school as old school gets and it's amazing.
It's fascinating.

1725
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:57.640
But for this guide,
when he talks about it,

1726
01:33:57.910 --> 01:34:02.410
he talks about how exciting and enriching every day is for him.

1727
01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:06.280
Every day has a purpose.
Every day is,
you know,
acquiring food,

1728
01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:10.270
living off the land,
figuring out a way to store that food.
He's got this,

1729
01:34:10.271 --> 01:34:15.271
I'm like this meat cooler room that he's built that's a like a sod house.

1730
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:18.160
So he has all this sod over it,
you know,

1731
01:34:18.161 --> 01:34:21.280
to kind of keep it in essentially underground keeping cool.

1732
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:24.670
And he has all his meat hanging in there.
It's just,
it's,

1733
01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:29.170
it's incredibly fascinating that people are like tuned into this stuff and

1734
01:34:29.171 --> 01:34:32.620
geared and a lot of my friends that have never had any desire to hunt
whatsoever,

1735
01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:37.270
watch these shows and sort of sparks that little fascination inside of them.

1736
01:34:37.390 --> 01:34:40.750
It's gotta be good.
I mean,
that's gotta be a good thing.
Yeah.
Um,

1737
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:45.130
yeah.
I mean that's just like Alaska,
the last frontier.

1738
01:34:45.131 --> 01:34:48.550
That's the one that I really liked and I think that one's kind of two fold.

1739
01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.310
The reason I like it is one because the cast,
the characters,

1740
01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:55.420
you know they're pretty pretty interesting and I like,
I like that.
But two it's,

1741
01:34:55.421 --> 01:35:00.290
it's the subsistence.
Yeah.
Subsistence lifestyle.
Yeah,
that,

1742
01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:03.740
that's an interesting one too because there's different people that are in that

1743
01:35:03.741 --> 01:35:05.000
family that do it different ways.

1744
01:35:05.001 --> 01:35:09.170
Like the one guy auto is a cattle rancher and he's got his cattle and then

1745
01:35:09.171 --> 01:35:12.170
there's the son who just decides no cattle ranching,

1746
01:35:12.171 --> 01:35:16.100
just going to go off a hunting,
don't do the whole thing,
you know?
Good luck.
Yeah,

1747
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:19.430
good luck.
Well you need it can be done,
but man,

1748
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:23.780
it's not as easy as people would think it is.
It's a 24 hour proposition.

1749
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:25.491
And then there was,

1750
01:35:25.491 --> 01:35:29.750
there was one just on discovery channel and all must have only ran for a few

1751
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:33.020
weeks called the hunt or something where they were documenting or following in

1752
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:36.800
10 weeks or something.
Yeah,
that's James Hetfield from Metallica was the,

1753
01:35:36.801 --> 01:35:39.230
the host is the guy and he got a lot of flack for,

1754
01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:42.170
for going on there or something.
But it's like,
it's like,
you know,

1755
01:35:44.690 --> 01:35:47.510
the mainstream networks and I guess that's kind of a frustration too.
It's like,

1756
01:35:47.511 --> 01:35:50.210
well why can't a hunting show go mainstream?
What can a typical hung,

1757
01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:51.021
she'll go mainstream.

1758
01:35:51.021 --> 01:35:55.280
Well I dunno if society would accept that or not at a mainstream level.

1759
01:35:55.281 --> 01:35:58.340
And yet the discovery child can come out with a series like that that is hunting

1760
01:35:58.341 --> 01:36:02.500
and it's,
it's bears,
you know,
they're hunting bears.
It's like how,
why,

1761
01:36:02.630 --> 01:36:05.990
why is that okay for discovery channel do that,
but for me to go out and,

1762
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:09.290
you know,
fill a deer and elk,
I think it's changing.
That's why I brought that up.

1763
01:36:09.291 --> 01:36:12.650
I,
and I was going to bring up the hunt because I think it is changing.

1764
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:17.540
They tried to get James Hatfield removed from the Glastonbury Music Festival

1765
01:36:17.541 --> 01:36:21.380
because he hosts the hunt and they used a photograph that they said with him

1766
01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:25.010
standing over a grizzly bear,
but it wasn't even him.
It's not him.

1767
01:36:25.011 --> 01:36:26.270
But pull that photo up,
you know,

1768
01:36:26.271 --> 01:36:30.260
that photo of that guy who was the actual hunter,
um,
he,

1769
01:36:30.261 --> 01:36:32.480
he's been sort of,

1770
01:36:32.481 --> 01:36:37.130
I'm going out publicly and promoting this like I don't know why these,

1771
01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:42.160
these anti hunters use this photo of a guy who Kinda sorta looks like James

1772
01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:46.060
Hatfield,
but it's not James Hatfield at all.
So it's complete bullshit.
It's not,

1773
01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:50.400
he's,
what he's doing is just narrating it.
They took into,
you know,

1774
01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:51.340
this,

1775
01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:56.270
this idea and they ran with it and there being a really,
um,

1776
01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:57.140
dishonest with it.

1777
01:36:57.141 --> 01:36:59.990
This is the guy sitting there promoting that as James Hatfield.

1778
01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:02.190
Just because he was the narrator behind the series.
Yeah.

1779
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:05.600
And will he kind of looks like I'm a little bit,
but it's not,

1780
01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:08.690
it's not James Hatfield at all.
That's James Hatfield.

1781
01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.760
I mean James had field does hunt,

1782
01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.130
but that's not him standing over that grizzly bear.

1783
01:37:13.131 --> 01:37:17.720
So the entire premise of this thing that they were doing to try to get people

1784
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:18.980
off of a,

1785
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:23.090
or get metallic or removed from this music festival was just a bullshit

1786
01:37:23.091 --> 01:37:25.940
photograph.
Have you had anything against you for,
for you going hunting?

1787
01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:29.840
Is we where it's like,
oh yeah,
don't let Rogan,
you know,

1788
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:34.280
don't let him do anything with UFC anymore.
No.
How could you do that?

1789
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:38.930
Cage fight.
That's the thing about being a cage fighting commentary.

1790
01:37:38.931 --> 01:37:41.720
You're already doing something so fucked up.
You know,

1791
01:37:41.721 --> 01:37:44.880
you're involved in what some people think is human cockfighting.

1792
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:48.050
They don't really care if you go out and shoot animals.
But yeah,

1793
01:37:48.051 --> 01:37:51.200
I've had people angry at me.
Definitely people call me a piece of shit.

1794
01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:53.330
Especially for the bear.
The bear was a bit,

1795
01:37:53.331 --> 01:37:57.240
there's a photo of me and cam standing over this bear a shot and I got more heat

1796
01:37:57.241 --> 01:37:59.730
for that than anything I ever did.
But it Kinda,

1797
01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:01.800
I think it's because people have this,

1798
01:38:01.801 --> 01:38:04.830
what they call anthropomorphication I think is the word,

1799
01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:10.040
where they connect animals to shoot with human characteristics like Yogi bear

1800
01:38:11.011 --> 01:38:14.280
and fucking all these ridiculous.
And when we grew up that way,

1801
01:38:14.281 --> 01:38:19.281
we exactly welding those animals and they have this idea of what wildlife is

1802
01:38:20.641 --> 01:38:23.820
that's completely alien from wildlife itself.

1803
01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:28.530
Those folks that I went bear hunting with a Cameron Hanes and the rivets,
uh,

1804
01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:32.050
Johnny and Jenny Rivet,
they run this,
I'm living the dream,
uh,

1805
01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:34.470
outfit or company up in Alberta,

1806
01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.710
the nicest fucking people you ever want to meet your life.
And they have,

1807
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:40.890
they have animals,
they have dogs,
they love their dogs.
They have a puppy.

1808
01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:44.160
Like people don't understand hunting would never imagine that these people go

1809
01:38:44.161 --> 01:38:48.240
out,
shoot bears all day and come home,
pet their puppy.
You know,
it's like,

1810
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:51.840
to them it seems like completely contradictory and alien.

1811
01:38:51.841 --> 01:38:54.990
Like how do you decide what animals you're shooting and what animals you're,

1812
01:38:54.991 --> 01:38:55.824
you're petting

1813
01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:58.210
<v 2>and I can respect,
I mean,
you can see why.
I mean,</v>

1814
01:38:58.211 --> 01:39:02.080
my wife's the same way and she's like,
how can you love animals so much?
And uh,

1815
01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:05.230
you know,
when you see a deer hit on the side of the road,
you're like,
aw man,

1816
01:39:05.231 --> 01:39:08.260
that sucks.
It's real.
And then the next week you go out and kill on.
She's like,

1817
01:39:08.290 --> 01:39:13.120
I don't get that.
And I'm like,
well,
it's,
it's,
it's hunting.
It's not killing.

1818
01:39:13.170 --> 01:39:17.830
You know,
she meat,
she eats meat.
Yeah.
She,
uh,
she's funny.
She'll try to,
like,

1819
01:39:17.831 --> 01:39:19.930
I'll cook up some elk steak or something and I'll be like,

1820
01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:24.220
and I got to admit I'm not a Rinella.
I'm not,
you know,
Remy is a great cook,

1821
01:39:24.221 --> 01:39:26.690
but I'm like,
I'm one of those guys,
I want a slab of meat.

1822
01:39:26.691 --> 01:39:29.830
I'm going to put it on the grill.
It's going to hit 120 degrees,
whatever,

1823
01:39:29.831 --> 01:39:31.750
and I'm going to eat it.
You know?
I mean,
that's,
it was like,

1824
01:39:31.751 --> 01:39:35.320
I don't want to spend my time preparing food.
I just want to eat it.

1825
01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:38.920
And so some of this stuff I cook doesn't taste that great,
you know?

1826
01:39:38.921 --> 01:39:41.740
And that's where it's like,
but it's me,
you know,

1827
01:39:41.741 --> 01:39:44.680
and it's meat that I killed and meet that I brought home,
so I'm going to eat it.

1828
01:39:44.710 --> 01:39:48.850
But to her it's like,
oh,
that's a waste of time.
So,
you know,

1829
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:51.430
if I spent more time preparing it in,

1830
01:39:51.431 --> 01:39:55.630
aging it and doing whatever needs to be done with it rather than just cooking a

1831
01:39:55.631 --> 01:39:59.200
need,
and yet she,
she might taste it,
but who knows?

1832
01:39:59.230 --> 01:40:02.290
So she doesn't eat your game meat?
No,
I cooked one time when I was like,

1833
01:40:02.590 --> 01:40:05.310
this is the best,
it was tenderloin from an elk,
you know,
and,

1834
01:40:05.311 --> 01:40:09.400
and granted I cooked it on the grill like I probably shouldn't have and it was

1835
01:40:09.401 --> 01:40:11.560
doused with barbecue sauce.
I man,
you couldn't tell.

1836
01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:15.100
I couldn't tell because I was like,
I want this to taste exactly like beef,

1837
01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:19.600
which it did.
And she chewed on a,
took one bite into it and spit it out,

1838
01:40:19.601 --> 01:40:23.320
blah blah,
blah.
And of course my boy sees this so he's like,

1839
01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.940
I don't ever want to eat here ever again,
dad.
You know,

1840
01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:29.560
cause mom's spit it out and it's like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Mom just doesn't like it.

1841
01:40:29.561 --> 01:40:33.570
But that's,
I don't know what it is.
I interesting hammer on it all the time.
Like,

1842
01:40:33.571 --> 01:40:36.750
man,
I just try it.
But she's like,
you can't even cook that in the house.
You know,

1843
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:40.350
don't even cook it in the house.
She won't let you cook it in the house.
She will.

1844
01:40:40.351 --> 01:40:43.260
I mean,
she will.
It's not,
I mean,
I wear the pants around their,
damn it.

1845
01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:48.580
He's going to try to reclaim power.
He's letting me be the man.

1846
01:40:49.690 --> 01:40:52.330
No,
but yeah,
she's like,
if you're going to cook that go outside.

1847
01:40:52.331 --> 01:40:55.690
So it's like that's fine.
Put It on the grill and I'll chew the crap out of it.

1848
01:40:55.691 --> 01:40:59.380
Then I'll,
I'll eat it.
I,
I enjoy it.
Well,
my,
my wife grew up in a hunting family,

1849
01:40:59.381 --> 01:41:01.780
so she's used to eating like wild game.

1850
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:05.170
She likes it and our kids have been eating it since,
uh,

1851
01:41:05.230 --> 01:41:08.620
I started hunting two years ago.
So when,
um,
my,

1852
01:41:08.770 --> 01:41:12.490
my youngest daughter was too,
there was like the first time she had deer.

1853
01:41:12.491 --> 01:41:16.540
So she's been eating deer since then.
Like they,
they'll eat anything.
Oh,
my kids,

1854
01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:17.950
my kids have been raised on,
I mean,

1855
01:41:17.951 --> 01:41:22.000
they've eaten more wild game than a lot of kids.
I'm sure they just don't know.

1856
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:24.880
You know,
it's,
it's the same.
It's meat,
meat.
When we cook meat,
it's meat,

1857
01:41:24.970 --> 01:41:29.590
whether it's a deer and elk,
raw chicken,
whatever.
My,
my two year old,
she's,

1858
01:41:29.591 --> 01:41:32.380
everything's chicken,
chicken,
chicken,
you know.
And it could be,

1859
01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:37.030
it could be a buffalo for all of it.
It doesn't matter.
Everything's Chechen.
Yeah,

1860
01:41:37.031 --> 01:41:40.470
it's,
it's a weird thing where people have this,
uh,

1861
01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:45.340
like this connection with some animals are like your friends and some animals.

1862
01:41:45.370 --> 01:41:48.850
Like you shouldn't,
you should never hunt this.
Like,
I have an agent,

1863
01:41:48.851 --> 01:41:51.850
she's a very nice person.
She loves animals,
but she told me,
Oh,

1864
01:41:51.851 --> 01:41:55.330
I don't mind if you kill pigs.
Wild pigs are discussing.
They're so ugly,

1865
01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:59.800
they're ugly.
You can kill them because they're ugly.
I'm like,

1866
01:42:00.010 --> 01:42:03.910
is it their fault that they're ugly?
That's the thing that kind of,
I'm going to,

1867
01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:07.720
it ticks me off because like,
the network promotes a support ellipse crap.

1868
01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:12.340
Oh yeah.
Here's the thing and a little background story to this.
I grew up on a,

1869
01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:16.960
on a farm,
obviously at one time we had a hog operation.
We had hundreds of pigs,

1870
01:42:16.961 --> 01:42:21.280
you know,
whatever.
But like,
I have a love for pigs.
I love the,
I love animals.

1871
01:42:21.281 --> 01:42:24.500
They got a personalities.
They're really cool,
you know,
I mean they're,

1872
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:25.300
they're cool.

1873
01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:29.930
And so when I see somebody who will rename nameless on a TV show thing,

1874
01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:33.400
Ma'am shoot one arrow through two pigs and that's okay.
But yet,

1875
01:42:33.401 --> 01:42:38.020
if I shoot one arrow through to deer,
you know,
even if it's legal or to whatever,

1876
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:42.580
it's not okay.
And then the very next minute shoot,
you know,

1877
01:42:42.730 --> 01:42:46.480
a weanling 10 pound pig in the head with a pellet rifle and watch it sit there

1878
01:42:46.481 --> 01:42:49.360
and flail on the ground.
That's bull crap.
You know?
Well,
it,

1879
01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:52.680
cause I had a relationship with that hot,
what?
That little pit.
It's like,

1880
01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.650
don't show me that.
Do it.
You can do it.
I don't care.
Don't show me that,
you know,

1881
01:42:56.651 --> 01:42:58.180
don't show public that because to me,

1882
01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:01.750
I think that the worst enemies for hunters and hunting television are hunters

1883
01:43:01.751 --> 01:43:05.620
and hunting television.
We're,
we're our worst,
worst advocate.
And I say we,

1884
01:43:05.621 --> 01:43:08.480
I lump us all on broad,
broad,
broad stroke is,
but it's,

1885
01:43:08.481 --> 01:43:13.090
it's like there's so many out there doing things that,
yeah,

1886
01:43:13.091 --> 01:43:16.390
it's the reality of it,
but it's not,
it's not what needs to be seen.

1887
01:43:16.510 --> 01:43:17.440
I know what you're saying.

1888
01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:20.650
And I'm gonna explain it to people who don't know what you're saying.
Um,
there,

1889
01:43:20.651 --> 01:43:23.440
there are certain shows and there's one show called pig man.

1890
01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:28.620
And I wasn't going to say I said it.
I said it.
Sorry,
Matt.
Um,
anyway,
uh,

1891
01:43:28.690 --> 01:43:31.030
pig man,
he,
the,

1892
01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:35.260
what they're doing a lot is population control rather than hunting.

1893
01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:37.360
And they are shooting animals,

1894
01:43:37.361 --> 01:43:41.590
but they're shooting animals that have overrun these farms.
So some of them,

1895
01:43:41.591 --> 01:43:43.090
when you were saying a porker lips,

1896
01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:46.180
what they're doing is they're getting these helicopters we've played video of,

1897
01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:51.160
it's the craziest shit ever have him and Nugent up in helicopters with fucking

1898
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:52.490
automatic rifles

1899
01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:57.470
<v 0>taken out pigs.
Like in mass,
they shot 450 of them or something in a day.</v>

1900
01:43:57.471 --> 01:43:59.480
Once.
It's the craziest thing you've ever seen.

1901
01:43:59.481 --> 01:44:02.390
These pigs are running and they're boom headshot as they're running their

1902
01:44:02.391 --> 01:44:07.160
tumbling.
And it's not about like we're going to go out and shoot an animal,

1903
01:44:07.161 --> 01:44:10.310
harvest it,
and then use it and eat it and you know,

1904
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:12.830
and show the hunting lifestyle.
No,
it's,

1905
01:44:12.850 --> 01:44:15.410
it's like it's a murder fest.

1906
01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:18.440
It's like pigs have a pass because of what they are.
You know what,

1907
01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:21.110
what they're doing.
I,
because they are causing billion,

1908
01:44:21.111 --> 01:44:24.290
probably billions of dollars in damage to the crop crops in that.
So it's like,

1909
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:28.130
it's like pigs.
Pigs had been removed from the game animal category.

1910
01:44:28.131 --> 01:44:31.040
They're verbose.
It's like a cat.
It's like a coyote.
Their environments.

1911
01:44:31.610 --> 01:44:34.960
But I will say probably on those shows,
I guarantee they have to,
you know,

1912
01:44:34.961 --> 01:44:38.630
then that meat has to be used somewhere and taking,
taking a donated and process.

1913
01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:41.740
They can't just leave him lay.
I mean that's,
I don't think so,
but well,

1914
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:43.330
dealing with 450 of them,

1915
01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:46.120
do they even have the resources to gather up all the are?

1916
01:44:46.130 --> 01:44:48.680
Because if they're shooting that many hogs and they're not doing anything with

1917
01:44:48.681 --> 01:44:52.040
it,
to me that's bullcrap.
Yeah,
they've got to have the resources.

1918
01:44:52.041 --> 01:44:56.870
Just like in New Zealand when they go in and call out the wild deer and that in

1919
01:44:56.871 --> 01:44:58.130
there,
because there's no predators,

1920
01:44:58.490 --> 01:45:01.640
they have the resources to go in with a chopper and pull it out and they,
they,

1921
01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:04.730
they harvest that meat.
So if they're shooting 450 pigs,

1922
01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:07.730
bastards better have a way to,
to keep that meat because that's ridiculous.

1923
01:45:07.731 --> 01:45:10.480
If they don't,
in my opinion,
my opinion.
Yeah.
I would.

1924
01:45:10.481 --> 01:45:13.280
I agree with you because it's a massive waste of great meat.

1925
01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:16.820
Wild pig is absolutely delicious.
It's really good for you.

1926
01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:20.090
It's completely different from domestic pig in the way it looks cause these

1927
01:45:20.091 --> 01:45:22.910
animals are eating all kinds of different natural things,

1928
01:45:22.911 --> 01:45:26.840
roots and and grasses and they're not just eating grain.
It's not like white.

1929
01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:28.520
It's not like a white meat.

1930
01:45:28.521 --> 01:45:31.610
Like that was the thing that they had this thing pork,
the other white meat.

1931
01:45:31.630 --> 01:45:35.900
I remember that.
That campaign,
if you ever see a wild pig folks,
it's not white.

1932
01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:39.770
It's not white at all.
It's just fucking red and it's not as red as a deer,

1933
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:43.550
but it's a dark meat.
It's cause it's healthy.
We should,

1934
01:45:43.610 --> 01:45:46.820
we should invest in a barbecue house and just go in and put a barbecue house in

1935
01:45:46.821 --> 01:45:50.360
Texas and then just go kill all the wild pigs and use that to get all your meat.

1936
01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:51.820
Well that's what pig man does.

1937
01:45:51.930 --> 01:45:56.420
What he does that show he had called it was going to call it that stupid series

1938
01:45:56.421 --> 01:46:00.080
on this hemorrhage.
Here I go.
They had had kind of is like,
don't worry about it.

1939
01:46:00.690 --> 01:46:04.560
It's like,
you know,
the whole concept behind is cool,
but as just,
well,

1940
01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:07.040
it's a reality show.
They were,
they were doing that.

1941
01:46:07.041 --> 01:46:10.490
They were killing the hog and then go in and providing it to this.
Uh,

1942
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:13.700
he had his own barbecue place,
which is a great idea,

1943
01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:18.340
but I don't think it's totally legal.
At least it might be a,

1944
01:46:18.341 --> 01:46:21.830
you can't sell wild game.
Like if I kill an elk,
I can't sell it,

1945
01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:25.200
which is a good thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I,

1946
01:46:25.201 --> 01:46:28.820
I can donate it and I tell you the amount of traveling and hunting and I do,

1947
01:46:28.821 --> 01:46:31.880
I donate a lot of meat,
you know,
and a lot of,
a lot of different places.
Yeah.

1948
01:46:31.881 --> 01:46:36.770
I wouldn't want to do.
Yes,
but don't you think that like wild pigs,

1949
01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:39.380
if they became a revenue source like that,

1950
01:46:39.381 --> 01:46:43.610
if they had a restaurant that if they have an animal that is so completely

1951
01:46:43.611 --> 01:46:46.100
overpopulated and overran that they don't have any tag limits,

1952
01:46:46.101 --> 01:46:47.630
which pigs are at right now,

1953
01:46:47.631 --> 01:46:50.610
you could just go and shoot fucking pigs all day long and they'll,

1954
01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:53.400
there'll be happy for you,
including California,

1955
01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:55.380
which is like one of the most liberal states ever,

1956
01:46:55.381 --> 01:46:59.220
which has all sorts of crazy regulations on animals that need to be called an

1957
01:46:59.250 --> 01:47:00.090
aren't like,

1958
01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:04.750
there's real issues here with mountain lions and is the real issue with,
uh,

1959
01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:08.220
with people that don't want people to hunt mountain lines and they don't

1960
01:47:08.221 --> 01:47:11.610
understand how ridiculously overpopulated these fucking things are getting.

1961
01:47:11.610 --> 01:47:15.780
And these poor people that are running farms have to deal with these animals

1962
01:47:15.781 --> 01:47:20.430
coming in and just decimating there.
The population of their calves,
you know,

1963
01:47:20.431 --> 01:47:22.350
the,
the,
the,
the game animals,

1964
01:47:22.351 --> 01:47:26.550
like the people that will tell you about when mountain lion hunting was legal in

1965
01:47:26.551 --> 01:47:30.230
comparison now and then the deer population levels,
there's no comparison.
Right?

1966
01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:32.400
I mean there,
there's their fucking everywhere man.

1967
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:34.800
And to hone ranch where I've been pig hunting before,

1968
01:47:35.130 --> 01:47:40.130
the guy who was our guide told us that he has a trail camera set up over this

1969
01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:44.350
waterhole and he got 16 different mountain lions on camera.

1970
01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:46.470
That's fucking crazy.
Danny.

1971
01:47:46.471 --> 01:47:50.230
Deer mountain lions can eat in a week one every couple of days.

1972
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:54.000
It's unbelievable how many mountain lions they have.

1973
01:47:54.001 --> 01:47:55.980
And it's because you can't hunt them.

1974
01:47:56.340 --> 01:48:00.240
And that is when you have a Predator that can't,
you can't,

1975
01:48:01.050 --> 01:48:04.400
if we're going to be the stewards of the land,
which is what most people look,

1976
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:07.980
if you were going to accept that we have regulations on game,

1977
01:48:08.130 --> 01:48:12.120
we have regulations on,
on,
you know,
fish that you can pull for the ocean.

1978
01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:16.740
We're supposed to be managing the population of these animals in a smart,

1979
01:48:16.741 --> 01:48:19.290
intelligent way.
And that's good conservation.

1980
01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:22.440
But when you remove some animals from that management,

1981
01:48:22.590 --> 01:48:25.050
simply because of public opinion,

1982
01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.250
not uninformed public opinion of people who are animal lovers,

1983
01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:31.810
that's ridiculous.
You can't do that.
That's,

1984
01:48:31.870 --> 01:48:35.280
that's contrary to the very nature of conservation in the first place.

1985
01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:38.020
Conservation isn't simply,
oh,

1986
01:48:38.021 --> 01:48:42.330
we need to preserve the habitat and give these animals food and make sure their

1987
01:48:42.331 --> 01:48:45.120
water is not polluted.
Sure.
That's most certainly a part of it.

1988
01:48:45.121 --> 01:48:46.950
And for people who don't know,

1989
01:48:47.010 --> 01:48:52.010
hunters had been responsible for way more money that goes to conserving wildlife

1990
01:48:52.291 --> 01:48:56.850
habitat,
conserving wetlands than any other group by far.

1991
01:48:56.851 --> 01:48:59.520
It's not even close.
No,
no.

1992
01:48:59.550 --> 01:49:04.110
Like tree hugger conservation group has come close to generating the amount of

1993
01:49:04.111 --> 01:49:08.400
money that has gone into conservation as hunters have.
But because you,

1994
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:13.200
you're controlling populations of deer controlling populations of elk,
pigs,

1995
01:49:13.290 --> 01:49:15.930
all that's good.
But you've got to control fucking predators to Yup.

1996
01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:18.720
And they're realizing that now and a lot of these states where they reintroduced

1997
01:49:18.721 --> 01:49:22.680
wolves and people are fighting against people hunting wolves.

1998
01:49:22.681 --> 01:49:27.630
Like you better fucking go online and research those giant super packs of wolves

1999
01:49:27.631 --> 01:49:32.631
in Siberia that storm a farm and kill a hundred horses and no one could do a

2000
01:49:32.881 --> 01:49:36.850
goddamn thing about it because you've got a thousand wolves,
Gil.

2001
01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:40.980
Imagine being in a fucking farm and you're looking out the window and you see up

2002
01:49:41.130 --> 01:49:46.130
pack of wolves just tearing apart horses and no one could do anything about it.

2003
01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:48.670
Well that's what happens when shit gets out of line.

2004
01:49:49.090 --> 01:49:50.650
And that's the way wolves worked here.
You know,

2005
01:49:50.651 --> 01:49:52.310
they'll be generate those super pacs.

2006
01:49:52.330 --> 01:49:56.920
Here's a great story from World War One where the Russians and the Germans had a

2007
01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.860
ceasefire.
They were in there,
were in the woods in Russia.

2008
01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:03.370
They had a cease fire because so many of them were getting killed by wolves.

2009
01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:07.240
They would send out these packs.
They would send out rather these,
um,

2010
01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:10.570
these parties would like search parties at two,

2011
01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:12.820
two men at a time and they would never come back.

2012
01:50:12.970 --> 01:50:15.880
And they would go out and they'd find their clothes torn apart,
covered in blood,

2013
01:50:16.210 --> 01:50:19.120
and then they realize,
oh my God,
these guys are getting taken out by wolves.

2014
01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:22.450
They were getting targeted by wolves.
So when they would have small numbers,

2015
01:50:22.451 --> 01:50:23.650
these guys had rifles.

2016
01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:27.160
They were fucking soldiers and the wolves were eating them.
I mean,

2017
01:50:27.161 --> 01:50:30.440
and so stop talking about wolves.
The wolves are fucking scary dude.

2018
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:34.420
Talking to a guy that spends a lot of time in the wild alone,
tell me next week,

2019
01:50:34.450 --> 01:50:38.260
next week I will be camping where there's a lot of wolves who by myself.

2020
01:50:38.410 --> 01:50:39.340
And it's like,
what are you going,

2021
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:41.950
I'm not afraid of bears as much or mountain lions or anything.

2022
01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:44.470
Wolves scare the crap out of me,
you know,
walls and light day.

2023
01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:47.290
I don't know what it is,
but what is about wolves?

2024
01:50:47.291 --> 01:50:49.030
Because there's so much unknown about,

2025
01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:52.920
there's so much unknown about modern wolves.
We know about,
you know,

2026
01:50:53.230 --> 01:50:56.070
wolves of history old,
you know,

2027
01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:58.480
and in times like that when there were super pacs on that,
well,

2028
01:50:58.990 --> 01:51:01.840
they're just now being reintroduced and there's a whole new generation,

2029
01:51:01.841 --> 01:51:03.150
my generation included that we don't know.

2030
01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:06.130
We don't know and understand wolves and their,
how they hunt and how they,

2031
01:51:06.630 --> 01:51:08.560
you know,
how they are evolving.

2032
01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:14.020
And so to me there's just so much eerie about them,
you know,
so much unproven,

2033
01:51:14.890 --> 01:51:17.710
you know,
I could be that first guy that does get attacked and killed by a wolf.

2034
01:51:17.770 --> 01:51:20.440
You know that that's there because

2035
01:51:22.090 --> 01:51:24.100
there's more people now too.
So there,
there,

2036
01:51:24.490 --> 01:51:28.330
there's more of a chance of a wolf being conditioned to people or public than

2037
01:51:28.331 --> 01:51:31.120
there ever has been before.
So I think that it's just,

2038
01:51:31.150 --> 01:51:34.840
it's a different animal today than it was a hundred years go or 200 years ago.

2039
01:51:35.170 --> 01:51:38.950
And the thought of me,
you know,
me or a hunter or somewhere in there,

2040
01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:42.640
you get a pack that's just in the wrong mentality that maybe hasn't been hunted

2041
01:51:42.641 --> 01:51:45.370
that much or has it been pressured that much cause you're your way back in the

2042
01:51:45.371 --> 01:51:48.400
wilderness,
you know,
they may be a little bit more aggressive than,

2043
01:51:48.490 --> 01:51:49.690
than what you would like,
you know.

2044
01:51:49.691 --> 01:51:51.280
So they just kind of creep me out a little bit.

2045
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:55.480
They should creep you out in the 14 hundreds of story called the the wolves of

2046
01:51:55.481 --> 01:51:59.000
Paris.
Have you ever heard?
No,
I haven't.
Yeah.

2047
01:51:59.050 --> 01:52:04.050
Wolves killed 40 people in Paris to the point where people had the track in the

2048
01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:09.100
city itself,
the Paris,
they'd killed 40 people.
And,
um,

2049
01:52:09.190 --> 01:52:13.930
it was that there was a Manny and wolf pack and a in 1450,

2050
01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:17.800
and the animals entered the city during the winter through breaches in its
walls.

2051
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:22.690
This is so crazy.
And it's one,
uh,
they,
they had eventually a counter.

2052
01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:26.830
They had cornered the wolves and they were killing them with stones and spears

2053
01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:31.540
in front of the note.
Notre Dame cathedral.
That's a fucking crazy story.

2054
01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:34.000
That's like taking coyotes have today does his,

2055
01:52:34.001 --> 01:52:35.230
there's coyotes roaming around here.

2056
01:52:35.231 --> 01:52:38.260
Probably are someone and turn him into Wolf's if that's,

2057
01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:41.410
if that's a wolf in that environment.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
Well,

2058
01:52:41.411 --> 01:52:46.160
even scarier because there are obviously a lot bigger and creepier,
but people

2059
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.560
<v 2>throughout history have had real issues with wolves.</v>

2060
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:53.390
But today we associate wolves with being dogs.
We think of them as dogs.

2061
01:52:53.391 --> 01:52:55.100
Like anybody would hunt a wolf as an asshole.

2062
01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:58.340
What do you think the Little Red Riding Hood Story.
Why was that about a wolf?

2063
01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:01.680
Why was that about a wolf?
Why is it the big bad wolf?
Why is,
why is the,

2064
01:53:01.681 --> 01:53:05.360
the three little pigs and the big bad wolf?
Because wolfs we're a fucking issue.

2065
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:09.050
You'd go into the woods and the thing that you'd be worried about was wolves.

2066
01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:12.470
Yeah.
Do you want your kid not to be able to walk to school because there's wolf,

2067
01:53:12.471 --> 01:53:16.540
Roman,
the the area,
you know,
or whatever.
It's like dad,
I don't know.

2068
01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:19.760
But people don't want people hunting wolves.
It's one of the biggest blow backs.

2069
01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:22.370
Well,
it goes back to what you just said.
You know,
I said earlier,

2070
01:53:22.371 --> 01:53:24.140
and it's not exactly the same thing,
but you're like,

2071
01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:27.560
you don't care what lifestyle people lead as long as it doesn't affect you.
Same,

2072
01:53:27.561 --> 01:53:28.311
same concept here.

2073
01:53:28.311 --> 01:53:31.520
People don't give a crap about other stuff as long as it doesn't affect them.

2074
01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:35.450
So it's like they can we all we all fall into a little bit is we can be

2075
01:53:35.451 --> 01:53:37.040
hypocritical and say,
you know,

2076
01:53:37.041 --> 01:53:39.830
I don't like this and I don't like this and this because that's gonna Affect me.

2077
01:53:39.831 --> 01:53:43.220
But if somebody wants to,
if you know,
if they want to go out and do this,

2078
01:53:43.221 --> 01:53:48.020
that's fine.
I don't care.
You know?
So they look at it as,
well,
I guess.

2079
01:53:48.021 --> 01:53:49.560
I don't know where I'm going.
I just kind of lost that too.

2080
01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:51.820
Now it's like right there,

2081
01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:56.840
like the people that don't interact with those wolves don't hurt me.

2082
01:53:57.650 --> 01:54:00.950
Don't bother my kids walking to school.
So don't kill the wolves.
Well,
it's,
yeah,

2083
01:54:00.951 --> 01:54:01.701
but you know,

2084
01:54:01.701 --> 01:54:05.030
my kid might get pounced on by a mountain lion because we live in the rural

2085
01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:07.220
countryside,
you know?
Well,
not only that,
you had to keep,

2086
01:54:07.221 --> 01:54:10.070
their population is down for the health of all the other animals that are around

2087
01:54:10.071 --> 01:54:13.850
them as well.
They can start decimating wildlife populations.

2088
01:54:13.851 --> 01:54:14.870
They've done that with ALC.

2089
01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:17.690
They've done that with deer in the areas where they had been reintroduced.

2090
01:54:17.691 --> 01:54:22.430
The numbers of elk have drastically reset.
I'm from Idaho,
man.
I know that full,

2091
01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:24.610
full on the valley where I grew up.
I mean in,

2092
01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:27.500
in the late nineties early two thousands I mean elk,
elk,

2093
01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:28.670
it was El cutting heaven.

2094
01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:31.730
There was outcome and down in our eaten out of our cattle fear,
you know,

2095
01:54:31.731 --> 01:54:33.570
right at the back of mom and dad's house,
you know,

2096
01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:38.480
there was elk everywhere and the hunting was awesome and they weren't bothering

2097
01:54:38.481 --> 01:54:41.840
the crops or anything.
Well then the wolves come in.
Can you imagine?

2098
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:45.590
Can you picture a herd of elk,
you know,
and all of a sudden there's,
oh,

2099
01:54:45.591 --> 01:54:47.780
there's a real big dog over there.
Well,
that's a big coyote.

2100
01:54:48.710 --> 01:54:51.950
The Coyote starts picking them off and it takes them quite a while before they

2101
01:54:51.951 --> 01:54:54.200
learn and condition themselves that,
hey,
that's not a coyote.

2102
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:58.550
That's something different.
So those herds were just standing.
They were just,

2103
01:54:58.551 --> 01:55:02.020
it's like a Turkey shoot.
They ain't never,
never sprayed around walls.
No.

2104
01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:04.760
They'd experienced mountain lion or mountain lions,
coyotes and bears,

2105
01:55:05.150 --> 01:55:07.510
which don't hunt like wolves do.
They don't hunt in packs.

2106
01:55:07.590 --> 01:55:11.060
A pack of wolves comes in.
They think there's the damn coyotes again.
Whoa,

2107
01:55:11.061 --> 01:55:14.210
we're Jimmy.
Go,
what's going on here?
And the next thing you know,

2108
01:55:14.211 --> 01:55:17.090
it takes them years to condition themselves to her.
Now,

2109
01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:21.080
elk hunting today is different than it was 15 years ago because the elk act

2110
01:55:21.081 --> 01:55:24.080
differently.
I mean,
there's certain instances where it's similar,

2111
01:55:24.081 --> 01:55:27.350
but they're a different animal to hunt today than they were 20 years ago.

2112
01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:29.540
Have you ever been,
uh,

2113
01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:34.450
hunting in any way and had to kill and had to keep a Predator off the kill?
Eh,

2114
01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:35.353
so,
uh,

2115
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:39.640
I was hunting deer whitetail deer actually in northern Idaho with a bow isn't in

2116
01:55:39.650 --> 01:55:43.920
like 2008,
2009,
something like that.
And I was filming the hunt,
you know,

2117
01:55:43.950 --> 01:55:45.480
this was before I started the TV show,

2118
01:55:45.481 --> 01:55:48.840
but at that time I already had had the concept of solo hunter in mind.

2119
01:55:48.841 --> 01:55:52.800
So I'm filming everything and it just delight,
like it's dark.

2120
01:55:52.801 --> 01:55:54.930
And so I go to take the camera off the,

2121
01:55:54.931 --> 01:55:58.230
the arm that I had and I flipped the switch and the camera down the bottom of

2122
01:55:58.231 --> 01:56:02.940
the tree crushed.
So I was like,
crap.
Well then a deer comes out.
I'm like,
well,

2123
01:56:02.941 --> 01:56:07.350
I'm going home tomorrow.
Anyway,
so I grabbed my bow,
thumped the deer,
and uh,

2124
01:56:07.351 --> 01:56:08.101
I'm sitting there in the deer,

2125
01:56:08.101 --> 01:56:11.010
kind of goes over and starts to do the wobble thing.
Well,
next thing you know,

2126
01:56:11.011 --> 01:56:14.970
a bear pulls out,
a black bear comes up and takes the deer down,
immediately,

2127
01:56:14.971 --> 01:56:19.260
pulls it over this hillside.
And I'm like,
that was pretty Dang cool.
I've wished.

2128
01:56:19.261 --> 01:56:22.530
And I was just,
I was more mad at myself than awestruck because I was like,

2129
01:56:22.531 --> 01:56:26.580
I dropped my damn camera out of the tree and I could have filmed that.
But um,

2130
01:56:26.730 --> 01:56:30.510
so I was more like just upset.
So I thought,
no big deal.
I'll just climb down,

2131
01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:34.830
go down,
spooked the bear off,
get my dear,
go home,
no big deal.
So I go on,

2132
01:56:34.831 --> 01:56:37.890
I'm trailing trailing this deer and all I've got is my flashlight in one hand

2133
01:56:37.891 --> 01:56:41.910
and my bow and the other and I can hear the bear sliding it down the the

2134
01:56:41.911 --> 01:56:45.420
hillside and it's a pretty steep grade and I'm like [inaudible] making noise,

2135
01:56:45.421 --> 01:56:48.210
doing whatever.
Cause I'd have experiences with bears and it didn't,

2136
01:56:48.370 --> 01:56:52.020
wasn't that big of a deal.
But then everything got quiet.
And then I was like,

2137
01:56:53.010 --> 01:56:55.860
and where I screwed up was I picked up the phone and called my wife,
hey babe,

2138
01:56:55.861 --> 01:56:58.710
I'm a trail and a dear.
I'll be home tomorrow.
What's going on?
I'm like,

2139
01:56:58.711 --> 01:57:02.190
oh this bear took it.
And I was like,
ah,
stupid.
Why would you say that?

2140
01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:05.310
Cause then from then on it was like,
and so from then on,

2141
01:57:05.311 --> 01:57:09.750
my wife's been freaked out about bears,
but,
so I'll finish the story.

2142
01:57:09.751 --> 01:57:13.680
But so I'm trailing often thisi super quiet and I'm like,
ah,
good.

2143
01:57:13.681 --> 01:57:16.860
The bear just kind of ran off.
I'm gonna go find my dear.
And I stood up on this,

2144
01:57:16.861 --> 01:57:19.440
uh,
this stump,
it was kind of a logged area.

2145
01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:22.200
I stood up on the stump and I'm looking around with this flashlight,

2146
01:57:22.201 --> 01:57:23.200
just kind of panning around,

2147
01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:26.700
looking for the deer and all sudden I hear her just kind of a noise.
I'm like,

2148
01:57:27.590 --> 01:57:31.080
I like this right at the base of that stump.
That bear was on top of that deer.

2149
01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:35.520
And he's just like,
he just huffed one time.
I just know far away from you.
Oh,

2150
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:39.540
four,
five feet,
six feet.
I Dunno.
I mean,
it was close.
I mean,

2151
01:57:39.541 --> 01:57:42.570
I'm standing on the stone and he's on this side,
on top of the deer.

2152
01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:45.390
So I just kinda jumped back and went back up.
I'm like,

2153
01:57:45.391 --> 01:57:49.620
what was I thinking going after a bear that just took down a deer that thinks

2154
01:57:49.621 --> 01:57:53.640
that's a deer?
He just hooked down so he's gonna be like defending,
defending it.

2155
01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:57.540
And I was like,
you stupid fool.
You could've just,
you could've just,

2156
01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:01.320
you could've been over right there.
So the next morning I go in no big deal.

2157
01:58:01.321 --> 01:58:03.900
Daylight,
the deer,
the bear doesn't have,
you know,
he's not,

2158
01:58:03.901 --> 01:58:06.930
it doesn't have a big a coneys during the day I guess.
But he just ran off.

2159
01:58:06.931 --> 01:58:09.630
I grabbed the deer and I have that on film.
Actually,
if you look at the,

2160
01:58:09.631 --> 01:58:13.200
the first solo hunter episode,
it's episode one on one.

2161
01:58:13.530 --> 01:58:15.480
It's got that where I kill a deer.

2162
01:58:15.481 --> 01:58:19.050
But then I do a flashback of the year before when I was filming that hunt and

2163
01:58:19.051 --> 01:58:21.150
I've got my little handycam that I filmed.

2164
01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:23.090
You can see all the scratches all over the,

2165
01:58:23.091 --> 01:58:26.160
the deer and you can see where the bear had eaten it out from the hind in and

2166
01:58:26.161 --> 01:58:29.610
all that kind of stuff.
How much of the bear the bear eat.

2167
01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:31.590
He had only eaten part of the hindquarters.
You know,

2168
01:58:31.591 --> 01:58:34.410
they always go in through the butthole and through the soft to soft tissue,

2169
01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:36.430
but he,
you could see where he had scratched it up and worried,

2170
01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:40.110
had drug it down and,
and uh,
just eight PARLA hindquarters.
But you know,

2171
01:58:40.111 --> 01:58:42.070
for the most part the deer fine,
salvageable.

2172
01:58:42.071 --> 01:58:44.830
So I just cut him up and took him home.
So when you,

2173
01:58:44.831 --> 01:58:47.740
when you have an animal like that,
the other animals eating part of it,

2174
01:58:47.741 --> 01:58:50.770
do you worry about it being contaminated in any way?
Is there any concern?

2175
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:52.150
I didn't even think about it there.
I mean,

2176
01:58:52.151 --> 01:58:54.400
obviously you're cooking it above a certain temperature anyway,

2177
01:58:54.401 --> 01:58:58.450
but I didn't even think about that.
I don't,
I don't even know,
honestly,

2178
01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:03.400
if that could have been an issue,
you know,
with a bear eating,
eating the meat.

2179
01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:07.870
I don't know anybody out there know.
If I could've gotten sick,

2180
01:59:09.450 --> 01:59:11.060
I have troubles getting out of bed and you're going,

2181
01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:15.500
this is wrong with my eyeballs.
You,
uh,
cut out around the airway.

2182
01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:20.230
Yeah,
I cut all.
But you know,
it's just,
I dunno,

2183
01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:21.280
I didn't even think about that.

2184
01:59:21.330 --> 01:59:25.540
There was the rivets that I told you about the guys up in northern Canada,
they,

2185
01:59:25.541 --> 01:59:25.751
uh,

2186
01:59:25.751 --> 01:59:29.080
they shot a bear and it was getting dark and so they went back in the morning to

2187
01:59:29.081 --> 01:59:32.980
recover it.
And another larger bear was eating it while they got there.

2188
01:59:32.981 --> 01:59:37.390
And they're like,
oh great.
It's great.
That's a real issue up there.
Cannibalism,

2189
01:59:37.690 --> 01:59:42.270
cannibalism is standard and it's,
it's just gonna get worse.
You know,

2190
01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:45.160
he's a numbers increase,
has cared,
only get worse,
can't it?
I mean,

2191
01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:47.500
until they get an get disease or you know,

2192
01:59:47.501 --> 01:59:50.710
and have a die off because nature has a kind of a way of taking care of itself.

2193
01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:52.300
Maybe four man came along anyway.

2194
01:59:52.301 --> 01:59:55.900
There was how many millions of buffalo roaming the countryside.

2195
01:59:55.901 --> 01:59:59.290
And I'm sure there were areas where the disease or something was spread and

2196
01:59:59.291 --> 02:00:02.650
there was a die off.
And so the herds moved off and split off.
And that's how,

2197
02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:07.090
that's kind of how animals maybe maybe moved across the countryside is,

2198
02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:10.510
is different elements of nature that happened,
you know.

2199
02:00:10.511 --> 02:00:14.770
So we look at this is where like,
you know,
I'm on this earth for 80 90 years.

2200
02:00:14.771 --> 02:00:19.240
Hopefully.
Well that's,
that's nothing in evolution of animals or in the,

2201
02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:20.020
the how,

2202
02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:24.850
how a herd or a spore or certain species might evolve in an area,

2203
02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:25.510
you know,

2204
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:28.360
and elk herd could grow up to a certain number and then it could have a die off

2205
02:00:28.361 --> 02:00:31.570
because of sickness.
They could grow again.
Well that might take a hundred years,

2206
02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:34.870
you know,
for that process to,
so for us to actually see that,

2207
02:00:34.871 --> 02:00:36.100
that population curve,

2208
02:00:36.130 --> 02:00:38.350
but then that's when you start talking about introducing the wolves.

2209
02:00:38.351 --> 02:00:42.790
That population curve takes a big dive quick.
But you know,

2210
02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:47.290
what was the logic behind reintroducing wolves?
Bureaucracy,
I guess.
I don't know.

2211
02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:50.230
Because wolves are cute and cuddly and they want them in Yellowstone because

2212
02:00:50.231 --> 02:00:53.710
it's a park.
But I'll,
there's no fences around Yellowstone.
I didn't know that.

2213
02:00:53.711 --> 02:00:57.400
Did you know that there's no fences around Yellowstone?
I mean grizzlies,

2214
02:00:57.401 --> 02:00:57.851
the next,

2215
02:00:57.851 --> 02:01:00.940
that next thing we got grizzlies in Idaho that are starting to cause issues.

2216
02:01:00.941 --> 02:01:02.050
And you know,
there's,
there's,

2217
02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:05.230
there's all kinds of instances in Montana and that grizzlies the next animal to,

2218
02:01:05.290 --> 02:01:07.960
to start causing issues I believe,

2219
02:01:07.961 --> 02:01:12.190
just because for some reason now it seems like

2220
02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:18.910
nature is at its prime for bear populations to grow.
You look at bare numbers,

2221
02:01:18.911 --> 02:01:19.870
hog numbers,
all these,

2222
02:01:19.871 --> 02:01:24.220
all these populations of animals numbers are continue to steadily grow
massively.

2223
02:01:24.610 --> 02:01:26.110
And I think that's just the,
the nay,

2224
02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:30.190
nay natural curve of where we're at that if we weren't involved in managing or

2225
02:01:30.191 --> 02:01:30.491
anything,

2226
02:01:30.491 --> 02:01:34.330
it had hit that precipice where diseases and cannibalism and all these things

2227
02:01:34.331 --> 02:01:35.990
would take over and nature would,

2228
02:01:36.020 --> 02:01:39.740
would curve itself back down to get sustainable numbers or they just out eat to

2229
02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:40.850
eat themselves out of home.

2230
02:01:41.210 --> 02:01:44.090
When you stumbled upon that bear and the bear was like four feet away from you

2231
02:01:44.091 --> 02:01:47.360
with the deer,
did you just back out of there?
I just backed away.
Yeah.

2232
02:01:47.361 --> 02:01:51.020
I was just like,
whoa.
Went back up and then,
uh,
slept in my truck that night.

2233
02:01:51.021 --> 02:01:53.750
And then the next morning I just kind of went around and I had my brought in my

2234
02:01:53.751 --> 02:01:57.800
gun and uh,
just a couple shots on the hillside.
The bear runs off you,

2235
02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:01.820
you get the deer d did you ever watch that show,
the hunt?
I did.

2236
02:02:01.821 --> 02:02:06.020
I watched one or two episodes of it.
And my problem is I look at it,

2237
02:02:06.021 --> 02:02:09.590
I'm ruined because as a producer I watch everything as a producer rather than as

2238
02:02:09.591 --> 02:02:11.000
a viewer.
And so it kind of,

2239
02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:15.110
I hate that because I can't ever watch something and get true entertainment out

2240
02:02:15.111 --> 02:02:17.570
of it are true value.
Well yeah,
I know what you mean.

2241
02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:22.280
But it was badly produced in my opinion.
I felt like,

2242
02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:25.550
first of all,
they kept using this fake bear sound,

2243
02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:27.410
the same sound over and over again.

2244
02:02:27.411 --> 02:02:30.290
They would interject it and you knew that they were interjecting it.

2245
02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:34.130
Cause all of a sudden like there'd be like a shaky camera and why is it bare

2246
02:02:34.131 --> 02:02:35.780
going to be growing and exact roaring?

2247
02:02:35.781 --> 02:02:38.480
A bear's going to be damn silent until he's ready to kill you.

2248
02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:40.190
And then they would do it over and over again.

2249
02:02:40.191 --> 02:02:44.390
Right before they cut to commercial.
So like to get you to like tune in,

2250
02:02:45.070 --> 02:02:47.150
look the camera shake and raw.

2251
02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:50.300
But you know what I guarantee everybody watching us like well bears make noise

2252
02:02:50.301 --> 02:02:53.420
in the wild not,
and that's the problem with shows.
Like you know like that,

2253
02:02:53.421 --> 02:02:54.800
that they're putting on the mainstream.

2254
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:57.510
There was one called chase and tails on there for awhile on,

2255
02:02:57.710 --> 02:03:02.240
on a and e or one of those where it's like everybody associates hunters as

2256
02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:07.310
flannel wearing overweight,
middle aged,
bearded men.
You know,
and we're not,

2257
02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:10.720
we're businessmen were regular people or whatever.
You know,
you,

2258
02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:14.090
there's all these two types of people that are hunters and that her outdoorsman,

2259
02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:17.710
but society sees us as Bubba.
Well in movies too,

2260
02:03:17.770 --> 02:03:21.890
like it's portrayed marine movie,
they were assholes that poisoned.

2261
02:03:21.891 --> 02:03:25.630
The directors are asked there's and all that.
And I didn't know drugs.

2262
02:03:25.631 --> 02:03:29.720
They usually drunk,
you know,
and that's,
that's because it's the same,

2263
02:03:29.721 --> 02:03:32.750
same concept as,
you know,
Disney portrayed animals as people.

2264
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:35.990
So we think of animals as people.
Well Mo,

2265
02:03:36.170 --> 02:03:40.520
Hollywood and whatever else portrays hunters as the dumbest.

2266
02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:44.870
Yeah,
the most simple minded.
Once reality,
you look at,

2267
02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:49.900
you look at the science and the management behind conservation and wildlife

2268
02:03:50.751 --> 02:03:55.550
conservation,
Eh,
it's not stupid stuff,
you know?
No,
he's not stupid stuff at all.

2269
02:03:55.551 --> 02:03:59.270
It's very calculated as contraceptives for deer.
That's stupid stuff.
Yeah.

2270
02:03:59.271 --> 02:04:00.680
That's birth control for deer.

2271
02:04:00.681 --> 02:04:04.010
That costs hundreds of thousands of dollars when dear delicious,

2272
02:04:04.630 --> 02:04:08.180
so they're running around instead of just having hunters come in and shoot them

2273
02:04:08.181 --> 02:04:09.740
with bows and arrows across crossbows,

2274
02:04:09.741 --> 02:04:12.800
whatever you can to control the population like that.

2275
02:04:12.801 --> 02:04:15.200
It would only take a couple of weekends and they could,
you know,

2276
02:04:15.330 --> 02:04:17.990
do big now and get a lot of meat out of it,

2277
02:04:18.370 --> 02:04:21.320
but instead they're going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and give

2278
02:04:21.321 --> 02:04:22.100
them birth control.

2279
02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:25.250
What do you think is the answer for people when what you mean,

2280
02:04:25.251 --> 02:04:28.040
what is it going to take for?
Have you ever,

2281
02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:30.670
if you've ever convinced somebody that hunting is okay?
Well,
I mean,

2282
02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:33.260
what's the answer?
What's,
what's the main thing?
How can we,

2283
02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:38.050
how can we educate people to where it's like,
you know,
hunting is not what,
what

2284
02:04:38.050 --> 02:04:41.040
<v 0>you've been taught and what you think it is or what certain people say it is.</v>

2285
02:04:41.070 --> 02:04:44.670
Well I tried to do it.
Well I don't,
I'm not trying to educate people,

2286
02:04:44.671 --> 02:04:48.420
but in discussing it and people listening to these discussions,

2287
02:04:48.421 --> 02:04:51.210
they kind of get a more nuanced balanced perspective.

2288
02:04:51.570 --> 02:04:55.710
And I know for a fact that there's a lot of people that post on my message board

2289
02:04:55.711 --> 02:04:59.820
that have talked about how they had one opinion of hunting before the podcast

2290
02:04:59.821 --> 02:05:01.470
and a completely different opinion of it now.

2291
02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:05.610
And they also never factored in the PA cracy of wearing leather,

2292
02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:09.570
having a leather couch,
leather seats in your car,
leather jacket,

2293
02:05:09.571 --> 02:05:13.440
and then complaining about hunting.
They don't,
there were disconnected.

2294
02:05:13.441 --> 02:05:17.460
And that disconnection is let us to be like spoiled little kids.

2295
02:05:17.461 --> 02:05:19.590
We don't understand where all this is coming from.

2296
02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:23.160
We don't have a direct interaction with the food itself.

2297
02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:25.800
And when you do have a direct interaction with the food itself,

2298
02:05:25.801 --> 02:05:27.180
when you've killed the animal yourself,

2299
02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:31.050
the whole process is a completely different thing.
I,
you know,

2300
02:05:31.051 --> 02:05:35.550
I'm eating an animal that I stalked,
shot,
butchered,

2301
02:05:35.610 --> 02:05:40.470
sliced up,
put into packages,
vacuum sealed it,
put it in my freezer,

2302
02:05:40.471 --> 02:05:44.100
thought it out,
cooked at eight it from a to z.

2303
02:05:44.130 --> 02:05:49.130
It's been in my hands and that's a completely different experience than 99% of

2304
02:05:49.561 --> 02:05:52.980
anyone who eats meat is ever going to have.
And I encourage people,

2305
02:05:52.981 --> 02:05:55.560
I think if you could do it,
if you have the time,

2306
02:05:55.950 --> 02:05:59.330
I think a lot of people don't know where to start.
That's one thing they don't.

2307
02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:01.440
Yeah,
I do.
I've got some friends right now.

2308
02:06:01.441 --> 02:06:03.900
There's three of them that are just starting,
starting out hunting.

2309
02:06:03.901 --> 02:06:07.770
Last year they killed their first year.
You know,
and it's,
it's funny to,
it's not,

2310
02:06:07.771 --> 02:06:09.740
I say funny,
it's,
it's interesting to see their di,

2311
02:06:09.770 --> 02:06:12.480
their evolution cause they're like searching youtube for everything.

2312
02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:14.370
They're like,
well how would you do this?
How'd you do that?
And I'm like,

2313
02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:16.320
I don't know.
I just do it.
They're like,

2314
02:06:16.321 --> 02:06:19.110
well they had to search on youtube to find out how to gut a deer.

2315
02:06:19.250 --> 02:06:22.410
And so they have this little video clip of him gutting this deer and did try to

2316
02:06:22.411 --> 02:06:24.270
take it all apart.
It's the funniest thing,

2317
02:06:24.271 --> 02:06:27.180
but it's like all these are grown men figuring it out on their own.

2318
02:06:27.210 --> 02:06:30.150
There's nobody out there to teach them.
There's no schools that are,
it's like,

2319
02:06:30.151 --> 02:06:33.000
hey,
you want to be a hunter?
Come to my school.
You don't pay tuition.
Do this.

2320
02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:36.230
And it's like if you want to learn,
it's got to be hands on.
It's got to,

2321
02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:38.040
you got to have a mentor.
You've got to have,

2322
02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:41.340
because I get emails like that all the time.
How do I get started?
How I live in,

2323
02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:45.210
I live in Arizona and I hunt these mountain ranges.
How do I find the deer?

2324
02:06:45.211 --> 02:06:49.350
Cause I spend countless hours trying to find deer.
How would you hunt this area?

2325
02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:51.810
I don't know.
I don't live there.
You'd have to,

2326
02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:55.140
there's a lot of information that we're asking for.
Two,
you'd have to go there.

2327
02:06:55.141 --> 02:06:57.360
You don't have to tell them how much do you know?

2328
02:06:57.361 --> 02:07:00.980
You don't have to explain to them what deer habitat is,
where they,

2329
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.810
where they nest.
Where the bed rather.
And there's also,

2330
02:07:04.170 --> 02:07:06.450
it's interesting but it's sort of,

2331
02:07:07.050 --> 02:07:11.880
there's a comparison to be made for you learning how to use computer software to

2332
02:07:11.881 --> 02:07:15.780
edit video you just taught yourself.
Yeah,
I mean if you want to do it,

2333
02:07:15.810 --> 02:07:17.760
you just got to kind of figure it out and teach yourself.

2334
02:07:17.761 --> 02:07:21.900
And the cool thing about today is you can watch those youtube videos.

2335
02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:24.180
I mean in the back in the day,
what would you have done?

2336
02:07:24.181 --> 02:07:27.720
You've gotten a book or something and try to like look at the diagrams,

2337
02:07:27.721 --> 02:07:28.321
do what I did.

2338
02:07:28.321 --> 02:07:32.490
You start cutting bloody hands and started cutting stuff comes out and you can

2339
02:07:32.491 --> 02:07:36.700
fuck things up like that.
Just start cutting,
right?
You can mess yourself up.

2340
02:07:36.730 --> 02:07:40.420
And he'd get the tarsal glands all over the meat and smell like shit.

2341
02:07:40.421 --> 02:07:41.254
And you know,

2342
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:45.100
there's a lot of people that ruin meet because they don't understand the proper

2343
02:07:45.101 --> 02:07:48.670
preparation and how to take care of it once they actually kill an animal.

2344
02:07:49.130 --> 02:07:50.220
Oh yeah.
There's a,

2345
02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:54.970
there's a lot to it and I think talking about it is real good.

2346
02:07:55.330 --> 02:07:59.470
I think it's important to have guys like you on and Rinella and Cameron Hanes

2347
02:07:59.530 --> 02:08:01.460
and Jim Shockey when it comes on TV.

2348
02:08:01.490 --> 02:08:05.830
So people get an understanding of who these people are that actually are
hunters,

2349
02:08:06.130 --> 02:08:10.630
that they're not those flannel shirt wearing yokels that you see in these really

2350
02:08:10.631 --> 02:08:15.490
cartoonish and character,
uh,
you know,
character,
richer,
character,

2351
02:08:15.500 --> 02:08:18.580
richer.
That's the word Kutcher,
caricature character at your,

2352
02:08:18.581 --> 02:08:23.020
why am I saying turrets or caricature?
The caricature is of of hunters.

2353
02:08:23.021 --> 02:08:25.930
These cartoonish shitheads I think,
yeah,

2354
02:08:25.931 --> 02:08:29.020
I think you're smart by having somebody like Shockey because he's,
uh,

2355
02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:33.450
he's at a different,
he's a different person than me or Steve or Remy or,

2356
02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:36.460
or Cameron,
you know,
we're,
we're different than what he is.

2357
02:08:36.730 --> 02:08:41.500
He's something special in that even if you took that man outside of the hunting

2358
02:08:41.501 --> 02:08:43.750
industry and put him into something else,
if he was an oil man,

2359
02:08:43.751 --> 02:08:45.580
or say if he was a cattle man or whatever,

2360
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:50.910
he's got a personality about him and philosophical way of speaking and knowledge

2361
02:08:51.191 --> 02:08:51.970
about him,

2362
02:08:51.970 --> 02:08:55.120
that he's gonna educate people just based off of what he knows and how he's

2363
02:08:55.121 --> 02:08:57.850
going to say something.
He,
and I could say the exact same things,

2364
02:08:57.851 --> 02:09:02.190
but the way he says it,
you're going to be like,
damn,
I get that.
But I say it.

2365
02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:04.990
You're gonna be like,
that guy's a fool.
You know,
you a little hard on yourself.

2366
02:09:05.110 --> 02:09:07.420
Well,
I'm just saying,
I'm trying to build up Shockey here.
I mean,

2367
02:09:07.421 --> 02:09:10.810
I know the guy needs every bit of it.
He can get it right.
You know,
guys like me,

2368
02:09:10.811 --> 02:09:12.520
we got it up.
I was like,
no,

2369
02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:15.030
but I'm saying is I'm glad you're having him and I'm going to,

2370
02:09:15.070 --> 02:09:17.980
it's definitely a podcast I'm going to be tuning into because I like his

2371
02:09:17.981 --> 02:09:22.360
philosophy behind not only hunting,
but life and also behind,
you know,

2372
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:25.490
family and everything else I do is I think he's,

2373
02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:30.030
I think he's a great person for that,
you know?
And I think it's getting,

2374
02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:35.040
I think that's the type of person that for broad society is your spokesperson.

2375
02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:39.910
Well,
I feel like that is a great one as well because he's so well read.

2376
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:44.080
He's a great writer and z educated,
super educated in a guy who really,

2377
02:09:44.081 --> 02:09:47.590
truly cares about environment.
It's really truly cares about hunting.

2378
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:51.230
Really truly cares about conservation.
And he said,
God,

2379
02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:52.840
it's in fucking fantastic shape.

2380
02:09:53.250 --> 02:09:56.710
I went hunting with him and the one thing that I was blown away with is how

2381
02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:00.220
physically demanding hunting is like hiking.

2382
02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:02.020
I looked at hiking and like that's for fucking,

2383
02:10:02.021 --> 02:10:05.100
people don't really work out bunch of pussies but uphill.

2384
02:10:05.190 --> 02:10:07.510
It's fucking hard man.

2385
02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:10.420
Especially when you're holding a rifle so you're not swinging your arms and get

2386
02:10:10.421 --> 02:10:13.000
a pack on like you get exhausted quick.

2387
02:10:13.150 --> 02:10:16.150
Did you have to pack your deer out or was it like in an area where you didn't

2388
02:10:16.151 --> 02:10:19.960
have to break it down and put it in your pack?
Uh,
what do you mean your dear?

2389
02:10:19.961 --> 02:10:22.000
When you hunted in Montana,
did you have to break it down a,

2390
02:10:22.001 --> 02:10:26.020
pack it out on your back?
Yeah,
we will.
There's three of us.
It was me,

2391
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:30.610
Callen and Rinella.
So my friend Brian Count.
So when we went to get my dear,

2392
02:10:30.611 --> 02:10:33.350
we had it,
we shot it that night.
Got It.

2393
02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:37.310
Took the liver and the heart cooked that that night and then put it up in a
tree.

2394
02:10:37.311 --> 02:10:38.780
We hung them in the juniper tree.

2395
02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:42.630
So we went there to get it in the morning because it was kind of late and uh,

2396
02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:45.740
we had seen some mountain line shit in the area.
It was kind of disconcerting.

2397
02:10:45.741 --> 02:10:49.910
He's big ropey shit filled with mountain lions have been hunted in that area so

2398
02:10:49.911 --> 02:10:53.570
they probably wouldn't even come close to you.
So yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.

2399
02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:57.350
I don't want,
I don't like those fucking things.
I've seen two mountain lions.

2400
02:10:57.370 --> 02:11:01.430
And how do you hear it while you're California again?
Never shot one.

2401
02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:06.320
I lived in Colorado.
You did?
I saw the picture on you.
On all social media.

2402
02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:11.870
I can't with hand bells.
Yeah.
That's so silly.

2403
02:11:11.871 --> 02:11:16.550
My Toki often strangle it.
My own sister asked me if I killed him.
Outline.
Really?

2404
02:11:16.551 --> 02:11:19.520
Yeah.
I'm like,
what the fuck do you think killed him?
Outline with a belt.

2405
02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:23.270
You kidding me?
Kill a house.
Cat with a belt.
Try to get a house cat.

2406
02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:25.310
Hold on to that fucker and killed with a belt.

2407
02:11:25.311 --> 02:11:28.100
I think will scratch your eyes out.
Yeah.

2408
02:11:28.370 --> 02:11:32.720
It's 150 pound house cat.
Are you fucking crazy?
Oh,
I've seen too.

2409
02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:35.330
I saw one in Colorado.
Uh,
really briefly.

2410
02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:39.480
It's like both of them been about the same size,
like 60,
70 pounds,

2411
02:11:39.481 --> 02:11:42.860
like dog size and the other one I saw in Monosito,

2412
02:11:43.130 --> 02:11:46.400
which is like a residential area and Santa Barbara.
I was driving on the street.

2413
02:11:46.401 --> 02:11:49.880
We saw this thing run across the street and the first we thought it was a
coyote.

2414
02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:53.480
Then I saw the tail is tails like boom,
bobbing around.
I'm like,
Oh shit,

2415
02:11:53.481 --> 02:11:57.110
that's a cat.
And it had a more of a bouncy way.

2416
02:11:57.250 --> 02:12:00.940
Like coyotes have that sort of stiff.
Yeah.
Fucking crease.
Scared to death.

2417
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:04.850
Shitty way of running.
Never seen a coyote sleep.
No.

2418
02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:09.400
That's cause they don't that you're used to getting shot at and chase down.

2419
02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:12.290
You can imagine being a coyote.
That's like the worst life ever.

2420
02:12:12.590 --> 02:12:15.350
It's a sucky life.
Other than like a rabbit.

2421
02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:20.600
I'd rather be a rabbit than a coyote from real people have rabbits for pets.

2422
02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:24.260
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
They're dirty,

2423
02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:28.010
stinky fucking little animals.
I got a coyote,
a cushion at home,

2424
02:12:28.020 --> 02:12:31.890
like a pillow that's covered in coyote skin.
It's gross.
It's like sleep.

2425
02:12:32.850 --> 02:12:35.650
My wife bought it.
It's not mine.
She's like,
I like she,

2426
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:39.680
she ordered like a couple different kinds of animal skins that were converted in

2427
02:12:39.681 --> 02:12:43.100
the pillows and for whatever reason she hates coyote.
So for whatever reason,

2428
02:12:43.101 --> 02:12:46.300
she got a coyote one.
She's like,
Babe,
I brought home this,
uh,

2429
02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:51.360
this animal skin couch that's a sheep of pay.
She turned,

2430
02:12:51.580 --> 02:12:53.840
we have chickens,
we have a 24 chickens.

2431
02:12:53.841 --> 02:12:57.830
So we have this a fenced in area where the coyotes are trying to figure out how

2432
02:12:57.831 --> 02:13:01.160
to get to the chicken.
So we'll find them near our backyard all the time.

2433
02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:03.500
And she loves these chickens.
She takes care of them.

2434
02:13:03.501 --> 02:13:07.250
So she particularly hates coyotes because they're always trying to figure out a

2435
02:13:07.251 --> 02:13:10.670
way to sneak in,
you know,
and they've killed dogs in our neighborhood before,

2436
02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:12.890
you know,
they'll,
they'll snatch one off a leash.

2437
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:16.520
I have a friend who lives in Brentwood,
which is another residential area,

2438
02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:20.390
and his neighbor was walking her dog.
She had like a little dog walking.

2439
02:13:20.391 --> 02:13:23.270
She heard click,
click,
click,
click,
click,
click,
click,
click,
click.
She knowed.

2440
02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:27.800
It was thought it was like a dog,
you know,
behind her.
And the coyote just ran up,

2441
02:13:27.801 --> 02:13:31.830
snatched a dog right off of her fucking leash and ran.

2442
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:36.960
That's a hungry dog.
That's a hungry Kyle.
Yeah.
It was running away with her dog.

2443
02:13:37.170 --> 02:13:38.430
Like the dog was just trying to,

2444
02:13:38.431 --> 02:13:41.870
and she's screaming and the leash is being dragged behind.

2445
02:13:41.900 --> 02:13:46.320
It's just running with her dog.
A sad,
sad and weird.

2446
02:13:46.410 --> 02:13:47.450
It's weird that this,

2447
02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:52.140
those creepy predators are wandering around and it just decided to bust a move.

2448
02:13:52.141 --> 02:13:53.680
Like this is the time.
Yeah.

2449
02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:59.530
<v 4>Kyle,
did you really?
Yeah,
yeah,
I was uh,
I don't know a lot of fucking,</v>

2450
02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:06.110
no,
11th grade.
11th grade.
Hello?
Yeah,
it was,
it was a long time ago,

2451
02:14:06.111 --> 02:14:07.850
but I was doing the dishes and look outside.

2452
02:14:07.851 --> 02:14:10.880
I was about five o'clock in the afternoon and,
and looking,

2453
02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:14.190
we lived in a trailer park,
so the trailer next door,
there was a,

2454
02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:16.970
it was a Kyle underneath,
underneath there just batting around,

2455
02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:20.720
playing around with some toys and all kinds of balls and stuff.

2456
02:14:20.721 --> 02:14:25.721
So I get out and I had a 22 to go around the back side and I see him and he

2457
02:14:26.031 --> 02:14:29.720
jumped up at the clothes on the clothes line and I rifled like two or three Adam

2458
02:14:30.050 --> 02:14:33.920
and I missed,
he ran straight into the woods.
I went back in,

2459
02:14:33.921 --> 02:14:38.070
I had a freaking rabbit call,
like a distress call.
Oh,
I,
yeah.

2460
02:14:38.090 --> 02:14:42.500
I shot back probably 200 yards and I got up against the tree and I started

2461
02:14:42.501 --> 02:14:46.160
blowing that fricking thing and sure shit that then came running right at me and

2462
02:14:46.161 --> 02:14:50.550
he backed me up against the tree and I lift my foot up and he latched right onto

2463
02:14:50.570 --> 02:14:53.480
my boot and I shot him point blank and I emptied out the whole,

2464
02:14:53.570 --> 02:14:55.760
the whole entire clip.
Yeah.

2465
02:14:56.260 --> 02:14:59.360
And it think smelled like skunk really bad.

2466
02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:04.070
But yeah,
enables,
scares a lot of hair missing off of it.

2467
02:15:04.071 --> 02:15:07.910
But though it was weird because that week before I had a two,

2468
02:15:07.911 --> 02:15:11.960
two little doxins in the family and I light,
we used to let him outside,
no leash,

2469
02:15:12.020 --> 02:15:16.280
they go take a shit,
come back.
Only one came back.
And,
uh,

2470
02:15:16.281 --> 02:15:20.630
we think there may be,
you know,
he made it took him most likely,
right?
Yeah.

2471
02:15:20.631 --> 02:15:21.930
We never got a bass week

2472
02:15:21.970 --> 02:15:26.570
<v 0>in silicone valley,
a mountain line,
viciously mall.
The six year old boy,</v>

2473
02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:30.500
some kid was hiking with his parents and,
uh,
the,

2474
02:15:30.530 --> 02:15:34.280
the kid was behind them in a mountain line,
came up behind a tack.
The kid,

2475
02:15:34.281 --> 02:15:38.180
the parents yelled at it and screamed and chased after the mountain lion and

2476
02:15:38.181 --> 02:15:40.740
just like tried to hit it and it dropped the kid and ran off.

2477
02:15:40.741 --> 02:15:45.590
But the kid got fucked up.
I heard that they scared it away.
But uh,
so then they,

2478
02:15:45.591 --> 02:15:49.760
uh,
set hunters loose on this,
a cat and dogs and everything like that.

2479
02:15:49.761 --> 02:15:52.360
And they,
you know,
this is another,
the,

2480
02:15:52.450 --> 02:15:55.970
another issue that they have with mountain lions in California cause they're not

2481
02:15:55.971 --> 02:15:59.300
hunting them.
Yeah.
That's crazy.
Yeah,
it is crazy.

2482
02:15:59.301 --> 02:16:02.930
And it's crazy how people have this idea that there are these beautiful things

2483
02:16:02.931 --> 02:16:06.230
and they are beautiful.
They're there,
they're interesting.
They're fascinating.

2484
02:16:06.580 --> 02:16:09.980
But you got to keep those fuckers the check,
you know?

2485
02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:15.350
And that's a real issue with people that don't understand law of wildlife.

2486
02:16:15.351 --> 02:16:19.520
They just have these liberal points of view that's based on no reasoning,

2487
02:16:19.521 --> 02:16:21.800
no logic,
not a balanced perspective,

2488
02:16:21.801 --> 02:16:24.860
no real true understanding of wildlife there.

2489
02:16:24.861 --> 02:16:29.060
Understanding he's just based on what they think is awry with they think is,

2490
02:16:29.410 --> 02:16:32.650
see it,
leave them alone.
There's natural animals.
Yeah.

2491
02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:35.980
And then you go hiking and you're going to get eaten.
You fuck.

2492
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:40.990
Do you understand that?
They're big giant monsters.
Yeah.
If those were Werewolf's,

2493
02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:45.170
you would be sending packs of fucking military people in the woods to try to

2494
02:16:45.171 --> 02:16:48.610
kill the Werewolf while mountain lions way fucking scary than a werewolf.

2495
02:16:48.611 --> 02:16:52.150
Cause it's not just a mountain line.
One day out of the month.
Okay.

2496
02:16:52.151 --> 02:16:55.180
The wolf man turns into the wolf man and the full moon comes out.

2497
02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:57.730
Mountain lions wake up every morning,
a mountain lion,

2498
02:16:57.731 --> 02:17:01.390
a mountain lion kill something,
and they killed big things with their face.

2499
02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:05.740
They're used to killing deer and elk and shit that runs really fast and they

2500
02:17:05.741 --> 02:17:07.330
kill it with their face and you're,

2501
02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:10.540
you're content with those things wandering around because they just look

2502
02:17:10.541 --> 02:17:12.310
beautiful.
That's ridiculous.

2503
02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:14.620
I'm not saying that we should wipe them off the face of the earth,

2504
02:17:14.830 --> 02:17:17.990
but we should come really close.
There should be like four or less.

2505
02:17:18.580 --> 02:17:20.220
You have four left Hoffman,

2506
02:17:20.310 --> 02:17:24.590
all of Houma we radio tagged yet leave him with Oklahoma with tags on that.
We,

2507
02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:28.240
we have a fucking a group of scientists that are monitoring their uh,

2508
02:17:28.241 --> 02:17:31.780
their progress on a screen and whenever they come anywhere near a person,

2509
02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:33.790
suddenly the hunters,

2510
02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:36.700
I think hunters would be glad to take the place of the mountain lions and

2511
02:17:36.701 --> 02:17:39.240
keeping the population in check.
Yes.

2512
02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:43.390
And eat that meat and you know,
use it for people.

2513
02:17:43.510 --> 02:17:48.270
I'm on team people,
you know,
I like people t man,
team human.
Yes,
right?

2514
02:17:48.450 --> 02:17:51.430
Like people way better than other animals.
I think animals are amazing.

2515
02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:54.320
People are way better.
You can talk to them.

2516
02:17:56.410 --> 02:17:58.150
They make you laugh,
you hang out with them.

2517
02:17:58.151 --> 02:18:01.930
There are species you breed with them.
They live in your neighborhood.
I mean,

2518
02:18:01.931 --> 02:18:05.650
it's fucking ridiculous.
That is with animals.
You can't though.
You can't.

2519
02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:08.290
You can read them,
but you can't.
Even if you fuck him,

2520
02:18:08.291 --> 02:18:10.030
nothing happens other than you get happy.

2521
02:18:10.330 --> 02:18:13.990
I promised my wife I keep everything straight.
Impossible on this show.

2522
02:18:15.430 --> 02:18:18.690
<v 2>No,
I did.
I told Mark Mark,
I'm like,
mark,</v>

2523
02:18:18.691 --> 02:18:21.750
you know when we get to talk and I have a tendency to dip a little bit,
I'm like,

2524
02:18:21.751 --> 02:18:25.450
you need to keep me on that level playing.
Don't let me go.
Let me do what

2525
02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:28.950
I like.
Good humor.
Good humor.

2526
02:18:29.430 --> 02:18:33.900
Typically get Rah Rah worried about your,
your perception,

2527
02:18:33.901 --> 02:18:36.150
the perception of people.
No,
no.

2528
02:18:36.151 --> 02:18:39.290
I'm not worried about my perception of people because uh,
you know,

2529
02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:42.780
people are gonna think of you.
What they,
what they do.
Right.
You know,
but I,
I'm,

2530
02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:46.230
I worried about me.
You know,
I,
I have a perception of myself that I,

2531
02:18:46.231 --> 02:18:50.580
that I like to maintain,
which is,
which has been and I believe is,

2532
02:18:50.581 --> 02:18:53.850
is it is what it is.
You know,
when you meet me face to face,

2533
02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:58.500
it's the exact same as when you meet me anywhere else.
God from that show.

2534
02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:00.440
The same guy from your show.
Yeah.
I think,
yeah,

2535
02:19:00.450 --> 02:19:03.780
I think I'm more of a bad ass in real life than I am on the show.
Honestly.

2536
02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:06.780
I watched back to the editing,
you know,

2537
02:19:06.781 --> 02:19:09.510
like I'm combing through some of the footage I just filmed last week.
I'm like,

2538
02:19:09.511 --> 02:19:13.770
man,
I got my guts hanging over my belt and I'm like,
I'm talk.

2539
02:19:13.771 --> 02:19:17.670
I slurred over it,
my voice and everything and I'm like,
I just don't look tough,

2540
02:19:17.671 --> 02:19:20.880
you know?
And I'm like,
I'm tough.
Whenever you say like that,

2541
02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:25.120
it's tough to convince me.
No,
I don't have that,
you know?

2542
02:19:25.210 --> 02:19:29.360
I don't have that deep raspy voice and stuff.
So it's like,
you know,
yeah,

2543
02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:32.510
we're all,
we're all,
we're all tough.
We're in our own mind.
You know,

2544
02:19:32.511 --> 02:19:36.350
you don't have to project it.
That's,
everybody thinks they do.
But when you try,

2545
02:19:36.890 --> 02:19:37.510
if you tried it,

2546
02:19:37.510 --> 02:19:41.420
if you try to create your brand and who you are and what you think you want

2547
02:19:41.421 --> 02:19:44.660
people to think of you as,
you're just going to be a doof Douche bag.

2548
02:19:44.670 --> 02:19:47.360
It's got to be yourself.
Yeah.
I like how you went with Duke,

2549
02:19:47.361 --> 02:19:52.010
but I know what you were trying to keep that even plan.

2550
02:19:52.030 --> 02:19:54.620
It's a Douche bag.
Cause I did post a picture today,
you know,

2551
02:19:54.621 --> 02:19:56.870
last night of the had the word Douche bag in it.

2552
02:19:56.871 --> 02:19:59.120
And you I felt yeah I got in trouble.
No,

2553
02:19:59.121 --> 02:20:03.230
I just kind of second thought it a little bit.
I'm like,
I just posted,
I should,

2554
02:20:03.231 --> 02:20:05.360
I have done that.
You know?
And it's like what's wrong with Douche bag?

2555
02:20:05.390 --> 02:20:08.330
Cause it's really how I feel,
you know?
That's really how I felt about the man.

2556
02:20:08.331 --> 02:20:10.700
So it's like who was the Douche bag?
What was it about?

2557
02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:13.320
I think it's fun in our country,
you know,
so bottles,

2558
02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:15.020
it was a bumper sticker on his truck.

2559
02:20:15.021 --> 02:20:18.350
It said it had to had a Douche bag with the Obama,

2560
02:20:18.470 --> 02:20:20.780
with the president's emblem as the,

2561
02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:23.630
Oh and then underneath that the guy was selling his truck.

2562
02:20:23.631 --> 02:20:26.960
So he had written his soap for sale.
So I just,
I'm like,
oh that's pretty cool.

2563
02:20:26.961 --> 02:20:31.250
Douche bag for sale.
Click.
And so I,
I post this,
not even thinking,
I was like,

2564
02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:32.660
oh it's the CIA.

2565
02:20:32.661 --> 02:20:35.330
Gonna come after because I've seen stuff that guys post or whatever,

2566
02:20:35.331 --> 02:20:37.640
they're like,
it's shut down my Facebook page or whatever.

2567
02:20:37.641 --> 02:20:40.400
And it's like they can do that and it's so weird.
Can

2568
02:20:40.950 --> 02:20:45.050
<v 0>criticize the president too harshly or if there's any threat whatsoever of</v>

2569
02:20:45.051 --> 02:20:47.580
violence,
like I'm going to kick the president's ass.
They'll come.

2570
02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:52.570
<v 2>They should too though.
You know what they should but so I,
cause you know,</v>

2571
02:20:52.571 --> 02:20:55.290
I'm a nice guy,
I'm on the outward side.
I'm a nice

2572
02:20:55.320 --> 02:20:59.170
<v 0>guy at home.
I'm a nice guy,
whatever,
but I'm a Badass on the mountain.</v>

2573
02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:01.590
I'll tell you that.
I see what you're saying.
I see what you're saying.

2574
02:21:02.250 --> 02:21:03.630
The second amendment is a,

2575
02:21:03.631 --> 02:21:07.840
is a funny issue when it comes to Obama because there was this,
uh,
the head,

2576
02:21:07.870 --> 02:21:12.480
this recording of him doing this speech and talking about guns and he was

2577
02:21:12.570 --> 02:21:15.180
talking about how people want to keep their guns.
They'll never,

2578
02:21:15.210 --> 02:21:18.510
they're never going to let you take the guns.
And I'm like,
what a weird thing.

2579
02:21:18.511 --> 02:21:23.280
It is where people,
representative government,
where where people are elected,

2580
02:21:23.281 --> 02:21:26.760
they get into a position of power and then they look at people and they say

2581
02:21:26.761 --> 02:21:29.940
things like,
they're never going to let you take their gun.
They're going to like,

2582
02:21:30.090 --> 02:21:32.490
why would you,
why do you,
what are you trying to do?

2583
02:21:32.491 --> 02:21:35.940
Like why are you trying to take their guns if you're just a person and what you

2584
02:21:35.941 --> 02:21:39.100
are as a president.
Yes.
Through the leader of the country.
Yes,

2585
02:21:39.101 --> 02:21:40.620
we were the commander in chief and all that.

2586
02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:43.590
But essentially you're just a person.
So if you're a person,

2587
02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:46.650
why are you trying to take away other people's guns?

2588
02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:50.130
Do you think that people shouldn't have guns because they're all dangerous?

2589
02:21:50.430 --> 02:21:54.840
Because statistically that's a real tough argument matter to people like that.

2590
02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:56.100
I know they don't care.
Well,

2591
02:21:56.101 --> 02:22:00.990
that's why those people are ridiculous in anybody in that sort of a position

2592
02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:03.450
that has that sort of a point of view like you,

2593
02:22:03.451 --> 02:22:05.430
if you're going to be the fucking president of United States,

2594
02:22:05.431 --> 02:22:08.640
you gotta be able to back up everything you say with logic and science.

2595
02:22:08.670 --> 02:22:11.190
And if you look at the amount of people we have in this country,

2596
02:22:11.460 --> 02:22:14.520
there's 350 million motherfuckers in this country,
okay?

2597
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:18.300
Not all of them are motherfuckers,
but some of them good and bad.

2598
02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:23.550
350 million people in this country,
there's probably 350 million guns.

2599
02:22:23.700 --> 02:22:26.070
Half of them are going on.
Statistically

2600
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:27.810
<v 2>speaking,
half of them are gun.
Probably.</v>

2601
02:22:28.500 --> 02:22:32.370
Then look at how many people are actually getting killed by guns.

2602
02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:35.550
The number is ridiculously low,

2603
02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:39.420
which means that most people are really good at controlling themselves.

2604
02:22:39.570 --> 02:22:43.290
Most people have cars and they don't just drive into crowds of people,

2605
02:22:43.350 --> 02:22:46.290
but some people occasionally do.
If enough people do that,

2606
02:22:46.291 --> 02:22:47.640
are we going to take away cars?

2607
02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:49.740
The thing of it is is like you could have those people,

2608
02:22:49.741 --> 02:22:52.500
he's sitting here across from you and you can be explaining to them and you can

2609
02:22:52.501 --> 02:22:55.170
have the statistical data and you can have the proof and the facts and

2610
02:22:55.171 --> 02:22:56.370
everything.
They're still not going to care.

2611
02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:59.610
They don't care because there's more to it than just doing what's right and

2612
02:22:59.611 --> 02:23:04.110
doing what is statistically fact.
It's,

2613
02:23:04.170 --> 02:23:06.390
there's always a,
an agenda behind it.

2614
02:23:06.391 --> 02:23:09.240
There's something that they want to push well as a control as it did and they

2615
02:23:09.241 --> 02:23:11.730
just want to control people or,
or what is it?
Who knows?

2616
02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:13.350
But when you look at everything that like,

2617
02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:17.310
like the government is doing and even small things of something as simple as

2618
02:23:17.550 --> 02:23:21.210
giving out 12,000 bay and as to the police force,
what are you trying to do?

2619
02:23:21.211 --> 02:23:24.540
Create your own,
your own army.
Are you waiting for a civil war?
I mean,
what's,

2620
02:23:24.541 --> 02:23:26.820
what's going on here?
Why are you buying?
Yeah,

2621
02:23:26.821 --> 02:23:31.440
they provided the armies or the local police,
local police and I,
and I,
you know,

2622
02:23:31.441 --> 02:23:33.570
I'm probably speaking out of turn here because I don't know all the facts,

2623
02:23:33.571 --> 02:23:36.960
wherever,
but it's like 12,000 bayonet,
what do you need?
A bayonet four anyway,

2624
02:23:36.961 --> 02:23:40.290
this isn't,
this isn't the world war.
[inaudible] nom,
whatever.
Yeah.

2625
02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:44.010
But then it's like,
well,
you bought how many millions of rounds of ammunition,

2626
02:23:44.011 --> 02:23:44.731
you know,
so it's like,

2627
02:23:44.731 --> 02:23:47.640
well there's all the conspiracy theories and all that kind of thing,

2628
02:23:47.641 --> 02:23:50.460
but you sit back and you think,
you're like,
why are they doing that?

2629
02:23:50.490 --> 02:23:52.050
You know what?
What's going on here?

2630
02:23:52.051 --> 02:23:55.170
What are they trying to create or what are they,
why did they decimate,
you know,

2631
02:23:55.280 --> 02:23:57.960
the military,
why did they fire all these commanders that,
that,

2632
02:23:58.250 --> 02:24:01.320
that did such a bad ass job of taking,
taking out the bad guy,
you know?

2633
02:24:01.321 --> 02:24:03.930
Why did you pull out of Iraq?
Why did you all these,
there's,

2634
02:24:03.931 --> 02:24:07.740
there's always something more to it than just fact and data and numbers and

2635
02:24:07.741 --> 02:24:10.260
what's right and what's wrong.
There's,
it's,
it's man,

2636
02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:13.530
there's power hunger or something to it.

2637
02:24:13.531 --> 02:24:16.080
There's a lot of public or something freaky about it.
I don't,

2638
02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:20.550
there's something sick going on that I don't get in what way?
It just,

2639
02:24:20.551 --> 02:24:23.200
nothing makes sense.
Wouldn't you think that if you're the,

2640
02:24:23.210 --> 02:24:24.990
if you're the leader of,
of the country,

2641
02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:28.830
you would do things that the majority of people would think make sense?

2642
02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:30.720
Like what?
What does it make sense to you?

2643
02:24:34.100 --> 02:24:37.310
I think what doesn't make sense to me is pushing,

2644
02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:41.000
like say take the immigration issue.
I heard a statistic the other day,

2645
02:24:41.001 --> 02:24:44.930
whether it's right or wrong,
that 9 million people in the greater la area,

2646
02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:50.820
potentially half of them illegal.
There's more than 9 million people here.
Right?

2647
02:24:50.821 --> 02:24:55.080
And there's like the greater la city area.
So it was a smaller,
whatever it was.

2648
02:24:55.090 --> 02:24:59.450
They,
they the number 9 million they said,
they said potentially there's,

2649
02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:03.630
there's ha up to half of those are illegal,
not document it.
Which to me is like,

2650
02:25:03.631 --> 02:25:04.560
well that's one city,

2651
02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:09.600
but why would they allow the people to come across the border just so openly and

2652
02:25:09.601 --> 02:25:10.860
now it's like as a parent,

2653
02:25:10.861 --> 02:25:12.750
I have a kid in school and if they're putting these people in,

2654
02:25:12.751 --> 02:25:15.930
busing them all across the country and letting these people go in school without

2655
02:25:15.931 --> 02:25:19.730
even asking their ages or having to go through medical checks like my kids do or

2656
02:25:19.731 --> 02:25:22.650
any of those types of things,
it's like,
what's the reasoning behind that?

2657
02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:24.040
It's not a humanitarian,
you

2658
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:24.161
<v 0>know,</v>

2659
02:25:24.161 --> 02:25:27.520
if you were a monetary and you'd block the block the damn border off and not let

2660
02:25:27.521 --> 02:25:30.460
people come across and experience all that,
you know,
suffering.

2661
02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:34.690
But then as me as the humanitarian little bit of humanitarian that I have in me,

2662
02:25:34.700 --> 02:25:36.250
it's like,
man,
if I'm in that position,

2663
02:25:36.251 --> 02:25:38.460
I'm coming across the border too and I'm working here.
You know,

2664
02:25:38.461 --> 02:25:42.050
I'm providing my family with a better situation.
But as a government,
uh,

2665
02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:44.500
managing government,
managing a country,

2666
02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:48.970
to me it just doesn't make sense that she would allow open borders.
Well,

2667
02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.880
I don't think it's totally open.
I mean,
it's difficult to get over here.

2668
02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:54.850
They risked their lives.
It's very tough and I know what you're saying,

2669
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:58.510
but I also think that politically it's,

2670
02:25:58.540 --> 02:26:01.230
if you want democratic votes,
um,

2671
02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:04.900
the more lenient you are towards people come across this border,

2672
02:26:04.901 --> 02:26:08.920
the more lenient you are towards illegals.
Latino's,
giving them rights,

2673
02:26:08.921 --> 02:26:09.970
giving them education,

2674
02:26:09.971 --> 02:26:14.350
giving them the ability to drive cars or maybe even possibly vote.

2675
02:26:14.770 --> 02:26:18.640
That's going to be very advantageous.
If you're a Democrat,
if you're a liberal,

2676
02:26:18.641 --> 02:26:21.760
and if that's what your agenda is.
That's what we're trying to pursue.

2677
02:26:22.090 --> 02:26:25.300
It's interesting in republican circles,

2678
02:26:25.870 --> 02:26:30.550
Cubans are almost all Republican.
I mean there's a massive,
not all obviously,

2679
02:26:30.551 --> 02:26:35.551
but like Miami has a large population of very conservative Latino's.

2680
02:26:35.711 --> 02:26:38.260
It's a completely different sort of environment,
very republican,

2681
02:26:38.261 --> 02:26:41.700
very conservative.
It's a,
it's a completely different setup.

2682
02:26:41.710 --> 02:26:43.410
Then they have with uh,

2683
02:26:43.510 --> 02:26:48.510
Latinos or Mexicans in La and a lot of it is to do with what they've experienced

2684
02:26:49.871 --> 02:26:51.490
in Cuba and you know,

2685
02:26:51.491 --> 02:26:56.491
how the hardships that they encountered in a communist land and coming over to

2686
02:26:56.501 --> 02:26:59.970
America and realizing the opportunities and what,

2687
02:26:59.980 --> 02:27:04.980
what you can accomplish here and what's going on with Americans and Mexico.

2688
02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:10.800
The disparity between California and Mexico is so vast and the distance is so

2689
02:27:10.931 --> 02:27:12.310
small that it creates,

2690
02:27:12.311 --> 02:27:16.870
it's really weird environment where like I was in San Diego a couple of weeks

2691
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:20.380
ago when I was joking around about how nice everybody is in San Diego and one of

2692
02:27:20.381 --> 02:27:23.620
the reasons why they're so nice cause you can walk to a third world country.

2693
02:27:23.890 --> 02:27:27.310
Like they know how good they got it.
If you want to get confused,

2694
02:27:27.550 --> 02:27:30.850
you want to think that uh hey man,
the world's all shit.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2695
02:27:30.851 --> 02:27:34.990
You're in fucking San Diego.
Dude.
This is awesome.
Why don't let's go for a walk.

2696
02:27:35.050 --> 02:27:36.910
You and I are going to,
it will take us about an hour.

2697
02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:40.030
We'll BMT Awana and then you're going to see something that's not good.

2698
02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:44.110
You're going to see this is what happens when you don't have taxes and the

2699
02:27:44.111 --> 02:27:47.050
United States government and this the school system that we have.

2700
02:27:47.260 --> 02:27:50.710
This is what these people are trying to escape and as a human being,

2701
02:27:51.130 --> 02:27:56.080
when I go there and I see that environment,
I want to,
I want to say,
hey,
yeah,

2702
02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:57.640
they should be able to do whatever the fuck they want.

2703
02:27:57.641 --> 02:27:58.810
They should be able to come over here,

2704
02:27:59.140 --> 02:28:01.660
but they also should be able to figure out how to,

2705
02:28:01.930 --> 02:28:05.080
someone should engineer that society better.

2706
02:28:05.081 --> 02:28:10.081
Someone should figure out how to make that culture at least as accessible or as

2707
02:28:11.231 --> 02:28:13.440
advantageous as the American culture.
I Dunno,

2708
02:28:13.660 --> 02:28:15.860
and I think that's where I'm talking where it is.

2709
02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:18.400
They should be doing that rather than just saying,
well,

2710
02:28:18.430 --> 02:28:22.280
if you can't have it there,
come here and do it here then.
Yeah.
For the individual

2711
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:24.420
<v 2>plants in Mexico to it as an individual.
Yeah.</v>

2712
02:28:24.590 --> 02:28:27.010
I'm doing exactly what they're doing.
Awesome.

2713
02:28:27.210 --> 02:28:30.500
Work in and I'm doing whatever I can to provide for my family and we know an

2714
02:28:30.501 --> 02:28:32.150
interact,
you know they're in Reno.
I know,

2715
02:28:32.151 --> 02:28:36.080
and interact with a lot of people that with within some of the churches and

2716
02:28:36.081 --> 02:28:37.130
stuff where it's like they've,

2717
02:28:37.150 --> 02:28:40.700
they've come here to better their lives and you can't hold them.
You can't.

2718
02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:43.730
It's hard to look at them and say,
well,
yeah,

2719
02:28:43.731 --> 02:28:46.310
but she broke the law so you've got to go back.
Right.
You can't do that.
No,

2720
02:28:46.430 --> 02:28:49.520
because you want as a whole,
you want people to have what I have.

2721
02:28:49.550 --> 02:28:51.110
You want people to be able to succeed.

2722
02:28:51.620 --> 02:28:53.970
It just sucks that their country doesn't see that.
You know what?

2723
02:28:53.971 --> 02:28:57.140
It hasn't done that.
But does that mean that our country has to be,

2724
02:28:57.141 --> 02:29:00.890
have liberal open Paul are relatively open policies where they're like,

2725
02:29:01.580 --> 02:29:04.460
if you don't have it there,
come here,
we'll give it to you.
But dude,
we still,

2726
02:29:04.490 --> 02:29:05.900
they don't really say that though.

2727
02:29:05.901 --> 02:29:08.840
I mean you do have to go through the border and it's fucking hard.

2728
02:29:08.841 --> 02:29:12.950
It's not easy to get from Mexico,
but not as hard as it used to be.
Really?
Yeah.

2729
02:29:12.951 --> 02:29:15.380
I don't know.
I mean,
I'm a guy that spends a lot of time in the wild.

2730
02:29:15.381 --> 02:29:16.850
I could probably,
I could,
I,

2731
02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:20.240
I'm not going to say that I could get across the border,
but kids,
well you,
women,

2732
02:29:20.241 --> 02:29:22.340
women and children and people are getting across.

2733
02:29:22.460 --> 02:29:24.230
They're getting across and it's got gotta be hard.

2734
02:29:24.231 --> 02:29:26.990
It's got to be difficult and difficult.
And some of the stuff that,

2735
02:29:26.991 --> 02:29:29.840
some of those kids,
you know,
have gone through that as devastating and it's just,

2736
02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:31.310
it's,
it's discussing,

2737
02:29:31.311 --> 02:29:33.890
you wouldn't want to ever have to have your family have to go through that

2738
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:36.290
process.
So we're a nation of immigrants.

2739
02:29:36.290 --> 02:29:39.920
This whole nation was started by people who came from someone who didn't like

2740
02:29:39.921 --> 02:29:41.900
and decided to try to make a better world here.

2741
02:29:42.140 --> 02:29:44.650
And at what point does that get closed off and who?

2742
02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:48.500
Who is that available to you don't ever close it off,
I don't think.

2743
02:29:48.740 --> 02:29:52.520
But it's hard for people that come from Mexico to like legally immigrate to

2744
02:29:52.521 --> 02:29:54.200
America.
It's very difficult.

2745
02:29:54.260 --> 02:29:58.430
They make it hard and you have to have some reason why they should have you
here.

2746
02:29:58.431 --> 02:30:02.480
If you're a scholar and you're coming from Norway,
it takes time.
You know,

2747
02:30:02.481 --> 02:30:05.670
you have to go through all sorts of check points.
There's a lot of,

2748
02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:07.350
a lot of things have to happen.
I've,

2749
02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:10.280
I've had friends from Canada that wanted to get green cards to it,

2750
02:30:10.281 --> 02:30:14.480
to work in America and you know,
white people that speak perfect English,

2751
02:30:14.481 --> 02:30:18.950
that are well educated and it's hard.
It's not that easy to get a green card.

2752
02:30:19.340 --> 02:30:22.490
I'm just glad that I produce outdoor television and I don't have to deal with
it,

2753
02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:25.070
you know,
I don't have to do it,
you know,
or manage it or that kind of thing.

2754
02:30:25.071 --> 02:30:28.940
Obviously we all deal with it in wherever we live in that,
but it's also,

2755
02:30:28.941 --> 02:30:31.280
it's weird when you've got half the population's illegal,

2756
02:30:31.310 --> 02:30:34.360
what do you want to make half the viva criminals like can,

2757
02:30:34.460 --> 02:30:37.850
there should be some sort of a way that they can,
you know,

2758
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:42.380
contribute as well because a lot of them are not paying taxes,
so it's even,

2759
02:30:42.440 --> 02:30:46.320
it's more advantageous to make them citizens didn't reg and do that for

2760
02:30:46.340 --> 02:30:49.160
[inaudible] for how many million?
9 million or something.
And they said,
okay,

2761
02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:51.720
Amnesty,
everybody that's here.
Yeah,

2762
02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:54.130
I believe they did a rake and I thought it was Reagan.

2763
02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:57.020
I'm not a bad thing and I'm just going on what I hear off the radio,
you know,

2764
02:30:57.021 --> 02:31:01.310
I'm just the uneducated white hunter guy,
you know Bubba,
but it's like,
you know,

2765
02:31:01.311 --> 02:31:03.850
they,
they did that at one time and now it's built up where there,

2766
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:06.380
there's almost no way around it that they're going to have to do it again.

2767
02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:09.200
And unless they are,
they're stop measures to keep it from happening again.

2768
02:31:09.201 --> 02:31:11.900
That's going to be 2030 years down the road.
It'll happen again.

2769
02:31:11.960 --> 02:31:15.170
It's a compassion issue in a lot of ways because when people are in an

2770
02:31:15.171 --> 02:31:19.010
undeniably shitty environment,
like you know,
Juarez,
Mexico,

2771
02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:22.440
and they want to get out and they see San Antonio's right over there and

2772
02:31:22.450 --> 02:31:26.040
everybody's doing the same thing,
I would say same thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2773
02:31:26.041 --> 02:31:30.140
It's the real issue is like,
why are borders there?
What?
Why are,

2774
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:34.220
why are nations there?
What is,
it gets real tricky.
It gets,

2775
02:31:34.380 --> 02:31:36.570
it's a very complex issue.
I'm going to keep hunting.

2776
02:31:36.750 --> 02:31:40.440
I'm just going to keep doing what I do.
Yeah.
I'm not even a tri pod cast.

2777
02:31:40.441 --> 02:31:41.340
I'm just going to do what I do.

2778
02:31:41.370 --> 02:31:44.460
When you're on top of a mountain with just a camera and a rifle,

2779
02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:46.470
how many cameras do you take when you go do that?
You know,

2780
02:31:46.471 --> 02:31:49.650
I used to take several,
now I just take one main camera,

2781
02:31:49.651 --> 02:31:53.040
which I use a DSLR camera that'll take stills and video and then I have one

2782
02:31:53.041 --> 02:31:57.390
Gopro,
but any more I find that I don't use the Gopro hardly ever.
The only,

2783
02:31:57.420 --> 02:32:00.240
the remain reason I'm using the Gopro now is because I had so many people

2784
02:32:00.241 --> 02:32:03.480
calling bs on me.
They're like,
there's no way you're filming that.

2785
02:32:03.481 --> 02:32:06.120
You've got a camera man,
whatever.
I'm like,
I'll show you.

2786
02:32:06.130 --> 02:32:10.160
So I mounted a thing off the back of my camera on my main camera that has just

2787
02:32:10.170 --> 02:32:14.520
basically a stick that I have a Gopro on.
So you can see me,
I mean there's,

2788
02:32:14.521 --> 02:32:17.950
there's a distance in one of the episodes that was on this year where you see
me,

2789
02:32:17.951 --> 02:32:20.910
you like fumbling,
I have to take a lens off.
I put another one on,

2790
02:32:20.911 --> 02:32:24.420
I spin the camera in the Gopro.
You can see the elk coming up.

2791
02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:26.670
Then you see me reach up,
focusing at turning it,

2792
02:32:26.671 --> 02:32:28.920
clipping onto the bow and then shooting it.
You know,
like it,

2793
02:32:28.921 --> 02:32:32.640
everything happens just that fast and it's like there take that stick in your

2794
02:32:32.641 --> 02:32:35.120
ear.
You know,
I filled this all myself and,
but it's,

2795
02:32:35.130 --> 02:32:39.060
it's become kind of a personal challenge that way where it's like,
yeah,

2796
02:32:39.061 --> 02:32:42.720
it can be done and,
and it adds more of a challenge to the hunt.
And to me it's,

2797
02:32:42.750 --> 02:32:47.550
it's in a case like that,
I didn't get nervous about making the shot on the elk.

2798
02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:50.940
I just drew back.
I didn't even range.
It drew back naturally,
just boom.

2799
02:32:51.450 --> 02:32:54.810
And the same thing happened with a deer that year.
Same thing,
drew back,
boom.

2800
02:32:55.500 --> 02:32:57.300
Because my brain was on the cameras.

2801
02:32:57.470 --> 02:33:00.420
My mind was on what I had to do with the cameras to get everything right.

2802
02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:03.960
And so hunt mode was natural because I'm,
I'm a natural hunter.

2803
02:33:03.961 --> 02:33:06.690
I grew up as a hunter from the time I was a kid.
So that,

2804
02:33:06.691 --> 02:33:08.310
that motion just to go over.

2805
02:33:08.311 --> 02:33:11.730
Whereas if the cameras weren't there and I'm just thinking and I have time to

2806
02:33:11.731 --> 02:33:14.760
wash that elk come up when I'm clipping on and I'm like,
okay,

2807
02:33:14.761 --> 02:33:17.460
where am I going to shoot him?
And I'm trying to range him and get a distance.

2808
02:33:17.461 --> 02:33:19.790
And you're trying to do all these things that you're supposed to do as a hundred

2809
02:33:19.791 --> 02:33:23.580
and then it's in your head that,
that,
that you've got to do all this.

2810
02:33:23.581 --> 02:33:26.400
And so when you anchor back your mind,
it might not be right.

2811
02:33:26.401 --> 02:33:29.160
You might be nervous.
I might be shaking cause there's been times where,

2812
02:33:30.140 --> 02:33:32.310
I mean else coming in,
I'm literally just shaken,

2813
02:33:32.850 --> 02:33:36.520
whether it's an elk or a deer and I'm just physically just,
I can't control,

2814
02:33:37.410 --> 02:33:41.700
like it's almost like a fear adrenaline.
Holy Crap,

2815
02:33:41.701 --> 02:33:42.720
this is happening.
Whatever.

2816
02:33:42.721 --> 02:33:45.990
I mean I remember as a kid sitting in a tree stand for elk and to the guys that

2817
02:33:45.991 --> 02:33:49.650
taught me how to bow hunt,
I was 13 years old and they're like,
yeah,
the best way.

2818
02:33:49.651 --> 02:33:53.030
Just go get in this stand and just wait for the elk to come into the waterhole.

2819
02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:53.821
Well shoot,

2820
02:33:53.821 --> 02:33:58.770
I'm a 13 year old kid up there by myself and you hear this herd of elk coming
in,

2821
02:33:58.771 --> 02:34:02.790
so you have 50 you know,
800 to a thousand pound animals coming in,

2822
02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:07.670
screaming,
chasing each other and,
and just,
you just freeze.
And I see,

2823
02:34:07.690 --> 02:34:12.050
I was shaking so bad that that platform on the standards,
like I was like,

2824
02:34:13.010 --> 02:34:14.910
man,
hold it together man.
You know?

2825
02:34:14.911 --> 02:34:19.120
And it's like that's what you get when animal comes in.
And I don't know what,

2826
02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:21.010
what gives you that adrenaline rush?

2827
02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:25.060
Is it the fact that you know you can kill it?
I don't think so.

2828
02:34:25.061 --> 02:34:28.360
I think it's just the fact that this wild animals getting close,
you know,

2829
02:34:28.380 --> 02:34:33.100
something anticipation.
There's so many factors.
Same thing when you go,
you know,

2830
02:34:33.101 --> 02:34:35.620
you're getting off the ski lift and you,
you,
you know,

2831
02:34:35.621 --> 02:34:38.020
you strap on the snowboard and you know you're going to go off this,

2832
02:34:38.050 --> 02:34:41.500
this one run that's you just looked at as you're coming up the hill,
you're like,

2833
02:34:41.740 --> 02:34:45.070
I'm going down that.
And then you get there and you're like,
holy crap,

2834
02:34:45.100 --> 02:34:47.500
this is scary,
man.
I don't know if I want to do this or not.

2835
02:34:47.590 --> 02:34:48.910
But I think it's that feeling.

2836
02:34:49.090 --> 02:34:53.710
It's like things more so even I get more out of it because that's more me,

2837
02:34:53.770 --> 02:34:57.970
you know,
I get more of a thrill out of elk and it's,
you know,
hunting and golf,

2838
02:34:57.971 --> 02:35:00.610
that's kind of my two things outside of family.
And it's like,

2839
02:35:00.970 --> 02:35:04.300
I get excited over that.
You know,
you hit,
you hit just a,

2840
02:35:04.570 --> 02:35:08.980
just a killer iron and you're just watching that thing fall and it's just kind

2841
02:35:08.981 --> 02:35:10.120
of cutting into there and you're like,

2842
02:35:10.450 --> 02:35:12.670
you get that feeling a little bit that could go in the hole.

2843
02:35:12.671 --> 02:35:14.980
You know where that's going to get close.
That's kind of the same thing.

2844
02:35:14.981 --> 02:35:18.850
But with hunting it's like that much more amplified because it's a live thing,

2845
02:35:18.851 --> 02:35:21.380
you know,
it's a live event and you don't have any control over that.

2846
02:35:21.420 --> 02:35:23.560
That all could come in and do whatever.
Yeah.

2847
02:35:23.561 --> 02:35:25.750
Anticipation and build up for one moment.

2848
02:35:25.751 --> 02:35:29.740
And also the amount of work involved in getting up there and it's like all for

2849
02:35:29.741 --> 02:35:33.340
this one moment.
Ready?
Don't fuck it up.
Don't fuck it up.

2850
02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:35.740
But what people don't see too is on TV.
You know,

2851
02:35:35.741 --> 02:35:38.910
I posted a comment on Instagram either he was like,
you know,

2852
02:35:39.100 --> 02:35:42.880
for you guys as information hunting's not as easy as it looks on social media

2853
02:35:42.881 --> 02:35:46.180
and on television,
you know,
which to me is a simple comment,
but people are like,

2854
02:35:46.210 --> 02:35:48.940
oh,
that's so true.
Blah blah,
blah,
blah.
It's like,
well,

2855
02:35:48.941 --> 02:35:51.760
I might be on the mountain for nine days.
Not seeing an animal.

2856
02:35:52.060 --> 02:35:55.930
Like I'm that Moose Hunt.
I saw one moose before I shot my moose.

2857
02:35:56.200 --> 02:36:00.970
So you're there for 10 12 days not seeing anything all sudden there's the most

2858
02:36:00.971 --> 02:36:04.570
bang,
whoa crap that just happened,
you know?
I was like,
wow.

2859
02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:09.640
So that's hunting.
That's reality of it.
Whereas on TV you see six,

2860
02:36:09.641 --> 02:36:12.730
eight minutes of me traveling those,
I think he killed a moose.
That's awesome.

2861
02:36:12.731 --> 02:36:14.470
You know that Moose show was wild,

2862
02:36:14.471 --> 02:36:17.770
the one where you shot the Moose and then it started floating down the river?

2863
02:36:18.250 --> 02:36:21.190
Yeah.
It wasn't in the room,
but yeah,
he was just,
he was just,
he was in the,

2864
02:36:21.210 --> 02:36:22.770
the marsh.
So where he was standing,

2865
02:36:22.771 --> 02:36:26.050
it was like knee deep and then he kind of went back in the willows and so I had

2866
02:36:26.051 --> 02:36:29.650
to actually go in the willows and pull him out because the boat,

2867
02:36:29.651 --> 02:36:32.080
we tied him onto the boat and tried to get the boat to pull him out,

2868
02:36:32.081 --> 02:36:35.740
but it wasn't happening.
So I had to go in and filled my waders.

2869
02:36:36.230 --> 02:36:37.120
I'm just tugging on it when,

2870
02:36:37.121 --> 02:36:39.430
what's on the video and I put the Gopro on my head and I'm just,

2871
02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:43.420
I had to just basically just leverage and get this moose broke out of the

2872
02:36:43.421 --> 02:36:45.870
willows to where the water was deep enough.
Word to float.

2873
02:36:45.910 --> 02:36:48.730
And I don't know how I did it physically.
I don't know how much does it weigh?

2874
02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:51.250
Oh that's 12 1400 pound animal.

2875
02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:55.600
That's a big damn 14 and a hundred pounds.
I don't know how I did it.

2876
02:36:55.900 --> 02:36:59.440
It had to been adrenaline because the moment we got him and tethered to the boat

2877
02:36:59.441 --> 02:37:01.590
and float over the sandbar,
I would,

2878
02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:05.980
people don't realize I was closer to death right then on any than any other hunt

2879
02:37:06.030 --> 02:37:06.863
I've ever been on.

2880
02:37:06.940 --> 02:37:11.170
I was so hypothermic that I had to get off the boat and I literally just took

2881
02:37:11.171 --> 02:37:15.420
all my clothes off and just piled on one dry coat that I had and,
and uh,

2882
02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:20.510
a pair of pants and I ran up and down the sand belt bar back and forth cause it

2883
02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:25.060
started out like kind of a hunched over little little trudge.
And it,

2884
02:37:25.061 --> 02:37:29.210
it took me about 40 minutes before I generated enough body heat to get myself

2885
02:37:29.211 --> 02:37:32.060
out of the hyperthermic state because I was so,

2886
02:37:32.061 --> 02:37:35.540
I was so cold because I was so excited about the moose that I just jumped in and

2887
02:37:35.541 --> 02:37:37.610
I'm like,
yeah,
look up my most,
whatever.

2888
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:41.010
My waders filled up everything and you're in water that's,
you know,

2889
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:44.930
just comes off of the glaciers up there.
Probably 34,
35 degree water,
maybe,

2890
02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:47.240
maybe a little warmer.
I don't know.
I didn't have a thermometer,

2891
02:37:47.241 --> 02:37:48.170
but it's damn cold.

2892
02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:52.700
So it just got me so close to the point where my body was starting to just

2893
02:37:52.701 --> 02:37:54.920
really get crazy and I was not thinking right.

2894
02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:57.680
The only thing that I could think of because everything was so wet was just to

2895
02:37:57.681 --> 02:37:58.310
run.

2896
02:37:58.310 --> 02:38:01.790
And so I just ran up and down the sand just back and forth and back by herself.

2897
02:38:01.940 --> 02:38:06.300
No,
I had that one guy.
Wow.
That's scary as fuck man.

2898
02:38:06.330 --> 02:38:10.100
Hypothermia kills a lot of people.
It's a lot of folks don't know killer.
Yeah.

2899
02:38:10.101 --> 02:38:11.810
You get to the point.
That's why I tell people I'm like,

2900
02:38:11.811 --> 02:38:15.350
it's a lot easier to stay warm than to get warm.
So if you start to feel a chill,

2901
02:38:15.351 --> 02:38:17.790
put a coat on,
you know,
don't get yourself.
Well.

2902
02:38:17.810 --> 02:38:21.350
The other thing about hard hiking too,
when you're hooking it up the mountains,

2903
02:38:21.351 --> 02:38:25.750
as you start sweating,
that's why wool so important.
People don't,
um,

2904
02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:30.650
many people who don't go into those environments and don't understand like how

2905
02:38:30.651 --> 02:38:34.650
you can start sweating when it's really cold out.
Don't know how great wolves,

2906
02:38:34.700 --> 02:38:38.330
yeah,
wolves.
Awesome.
I like,
there's some great synthetics out there to the wick.

2907
02:38:38.331 --> 02:38:42.410
The moisture away from your body,
like will say,
well,
I like,
you know,

2908
02:38:42.770 --> 02:38:46.340
I grew up as a wool guy.
Everything was all,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
Well,

2909
02:38:46.341 --> 02:38:47.240
a lot of synthetics.

2910
02:38:47.241 --> 02:38:49.400
They'll pull it away from your body and then they'll drive fast.

2911
02:38:49.460 --> 02:38:51.530
Real wool is gonna pull it away from your body.

2912
02:38:51.531 --> 02:38:55.550
And the cool thing about wool is even when it's wet,
it's going to keep you warm,

2913
02:38:56.270 --> 02:38:59.180
but it doesn't try real fast.
Whereas the synthetics,

2914
02:38:59.210 --> 02:39:02.720
synthetics a pull it away but then they'll dry fast too.
Why is it dry faster?

2915
02:39:02.750 --> 02:39:04.640
Just to,
it's just the fiber.
Just the fabric.

2916
02:39:04.641 --> 02:39:08.000
I don't think it holds the moisture as as well,
but it pulls it away.

2917
02:39:08.001 --> 02:39:12.380
It's like a more closed off wool is still amazing because if you can't get dry

2918
02:39:12.530 --> 02:39:15.070
we'll still going to keep you warm.
Yeah.
Isn't that crazy?
Yeah,

2919
02:39:15.290 --> 02:39:17.430
but it's heavy and bulky on the,
I don't know.
There's,

2920
02:39:17.460 --> 02:39:19.540
there's some good stuff you guys mentioned firstlight there.

2921
02:39:19.541 --> 02:39:21.800
That's some amazing stuff.
But you know,

2922
02:39:21.801 --> 02:39:26.090
I've grown to two were probably about 10 years ago I moved away from wool and

2923
02:39:26.091 --> 02:39:28.370
into synthetics just cause they,
the technology was there,

2924
02:39:28.371 --> 02:39:30.670
there was started getting better and then cause it's lighter.
Yeah.

2925
02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:34.370
Now I'm with under Armour so it's obviously an underarm or leaving them.

2926
02:39:34.371 --> 02:39:37.730
They've got some clothing that we prototyped this last fall that was a kind of a

2927
02:39:37.731 --> 02:39:42.680
wool acrylic blend that was pretty amazing.
Pretty good stuff.
So really,

2928
02:39:42.970 --> 02:39:46.870
but we'll a clear acrylic blends.
Yeah,
we just announced,
yeah.

2929
02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:51.770
It's not necessarily it's similar texture and feel to,
to the wool,
but you know,

2930
02:39:51.771 --> 02:39:54.590
you combine that with some of the synthetic base layers in that and it's,

2931
02:39:54.591 --> 02:39:56.240
you've just got a really hearty,

2932
02:39:56.330 --> 02:40:01.330
durable fabric that can be replicated and printed on and all kinds of different

2933
02:40:02.871 --> 02:40:07.520
things.
But that's a consideration that you have to really plan out,
right?

2934
02:40:07.550 --> 02:40:10.520
Like how much weight you're carrying.
Like what,

2935
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:13.320
how much stuff do you actually need?
You take,

2936
02:40:13.350 --> 02:40:16.710
you take what you need and uh,
that's it.
I mean,

2937
02:40:16.711 --> 02:40:20.370
there's no reason to take any comfort.
I mean,
that's one of the things that I,

2938
02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:24.150
that I probably should be better at.
Like I hate sleeping on the ground when I,

2939
02:40:24.180 --> 02:40:27.080
when I hunt,
I'm miserable.
Like at night I,

2940
02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:29.970
I basically just roll from one side of the Eczema side the next,

2941
02:40:30.330 --> 02:40:33.750
because I can't sleep because I'm like not taking that two pound pad.

2942
02:40:33.751 --> 02:40:36.300
I'm going to take it,
take the 16 ounce pad instead,
you know,

2943
02:40:36.301 --> 02:40:38.290
thinking one pound wall.
It's like,
you know,
on,

2944
02:40:38.291 --> 02:40:40.500
I've got seven pounds around my stomach that I,

2945
02:40:40.590 --> 02:40:43.450
that I'm carrying around that I shouldn't be carrying around either.
Right?

2946
02:40:43.470 --> 02:40:47.700
But we all get so caught up into the weight that you know,
you,

2947
02:40:47.701 --> 02:40:50.610
you kind of neglect certain things and that's important when you're going on a

2948
02:40:50.611 --> 02:40:53.580
back country pack trip where you're going to be in several days in that weight

2949
02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:56.520
weight's a big deal because when you start hiking up a mountain,

2950
02:40:56.940 --> 02:40:59.910
you're just thinking,
I mean,
I know I do.
I'm thinking in my mind,

2951
02:40:59.940 --> 02:41:01.410
what can I have left out of my pack?

2952
02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:02.910
You know what could have made this trip lighter?

2953
02:41:02.911 --> 02:41:05.250
Because if you don't have a pack,
it's a lot easier to get up the mountain,

2954
02:41:05.310 --> 02:41:09.690
but you gotta be comfortable or you're going to hike your butt back off the

2955
02:41:09.691 --> 02:41:13.280
mountain to wear like a lightweight boot too.
I do.
I'm a light.

2956
02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:16.290
I'm super lightweight,
boot all the time.
Even in rugged country.

2957
02:41:16.291 --> 02:41:18.630
I like a really lightweight boot.
I've never,
I'm the kind of guy,

2958
02:41:18.631 --> 02:41:22.620
I've never sprained an ankle,
never,
never had any knee or an ankle issues.

2959
02:41:22.621 --> 02:41:25.350
I've had knee issues,
but that really doesn't have anything to do with the boot.

2960
02:41:25.351 --> 02:41:30.240
But it's like,
I like lightweight.
I like maneuverability and just,
I feel more,

2961
02:41:31.710 --> 02:41:34.710
feel more mobile.
I don't like the big heavy rock mountain boots,
you know?

2962
02:41:34.711 --> 02:41:36.500
And I've,
I've worn them unlock,

2963
02:41:36.630 --> 02:41:40.650
but they're just rigid and I just feel like my legs get tired and I just can't

2964
02:41:40.740 --> 02:41:43.650
move.
But when I have a light boot that's more like a sneaker,

2965
02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:46.380
I don't think my legs get as tired and I can just,
yeah,

2966
02:41:46.381 --> 02:41:48.450
that's what I'm thinking because I'm going,

2967
02:41:48.451 --> 02:41:52.860
I'm a hunting in Alaska first week of October and uh,

2968
02:41:52.861 --> 02:41:54.030
I had these,
uh,

2969
02:41:54.450 --> 02:41:59.250
these heavy schnee's could boot great heavy boots.
They're real,

2970
02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:01.800
they're excellent,
waterproof and were like that.
But man,

2971
02:42:01.801 --> 02:42:04.470
I went hiking with them recently,
trying to break them in.
I'm like,

2972
02:42:04.650 --> 02:42:08.750
my fucking legs tried to Ryan leather when it's rain in a bunch too.
I mean,
it's,

2973
02:42:08.751 --> 02:42:11.490
it's hard,
but that,
that boot is made for that environment.

2974
02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:13.470
That's the type of boot that is made for that.
You know,

2975
02:42:13.471 --> 02:42:15.290
there's some synthetics out there too that,

2976
02:42:15.340 --> 02:42:19.050
that might dry a little easier in that.
But I've always been one where it's like,

2977
02:42:19.051 --> 02:42:23.710
you know,
I just,
I,
I don't have issues with blisters.
You know,
I,

2978
02:42:23.730 --> 02:42:27.180
I don't,
I just,
I'm just lucky that way.
I haven't ever had to deal with that.

2979
02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:29.550
When I wear a pair of my lightweight,
uh,
you know,

2980
02:42:29.551 --> 02:42:33.960
under Armour is my speed freaks or whatever and it's like I wore him,
I'm in my,

2981
02:42:34.170 --> 02:42:36.690
and halfway through my second season on one pair of boots,

2982
02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:40.170
which typically I go through a pair of boots easy in a season,

2983
02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:44.310
but this lightweight pair of speed freaks,
I've had it in the snow.
You know,

2984
02:42:44.311 --> 02:42:46.960
the shale,
this is under armor speeds and under Armour speech,

2985
02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:50.070
these ones are prototypes.
I don't know if it's the actual speed freak,

2986
02:42:50.071 --> 02:42:54.240
it's a prototype boot.
They sent me a new product that's kind of be cool.

2987
02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:56.910
That's awesome.
That's one cool thing about,
you know,

2988
02:42:56.911 --> 02:43:01.080
I've been on knocking on underarmour's door for three or four years and last

2989
02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:03.090
year I was fed up.
I was like,
you know what,

2990
02:43:03.091 --> 02:43:04.470
these guys are never going to give me the time of day.

2991
02:43:04.471 --> 02:43:07.590
They're cool guys and everything,
but they're looking for bigger fish.

2992
02:43:08.070 --> 02:43:11.880
And so this is probably the first time they've heard that is like I,

2993
02:43:11.950 --> 02:43:14.770
I got rid of all my under Armour gear and uh,

2994
02:43:15.730 --> 02:43:18.400
was decked out with another brand.
They decked me out everything,
head to toe,

2995
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:19.690
everything.
So I was like,

2996
02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:23.400
I was all geared up to go on my first hunt in this other brand.
And uh,

2997
02:43:23.530 --> 02:43:26.430
then something just hit me.
My wife's like,
where'd you get all that Cam on?

2998
02:43:26.450 --> 02:43:28.930
Cause I told her the story and she's like,
what about under Armour?
And I go,

2999
02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:32.080
I can't give up on under Kanye.
And she's like,

3000
02:43:32.081 --> 02:43:34.780
you were going to give up on under Armour.
So I went to,

3001
02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:36.490
I was leaving for my hunt,

3002
02:43:36.491 --> 02:43:39.520
I went to shields and I bought a pair of pants and a shirt under Armour pair of

3003
02:43:39.521 --> 02:43:41.620
pants and a shirt.
I went on my hunt,

3004
02:43:41.650 --> 02:43:46.060
I killed this deer while I was driving back.
Coby gave me a call and said,
hey,

3005
02:43:46.330 --> 02:43:48.790
things have developed.
We've,
we've got some stuff freed up.

3006
02:43:48.820 --> 02:43:52.330
We'd really love to have you guys on board.
So it's like,
holy crap,

3007
02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:56.280
I just about threw underarmour way,
you know,
just from that.
But it,

3008
02:43:56.320 --> 02:43:58.900
but as a TV guys,
like you want to have the best brands,

3009
02:43:58.910 --> 02:44:00.820
you want to wear the guest best gear and everything.

3010
02:44:01.150 --> 02:44:03.400
But on the second part of it is you got to pay the bills.

3011
02:44:03.401 --> 02:44:06.070
You got to make it worth your while to do it.
Because at the end of the day,

3012
02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:08.050
I'm not doing it because I'm a passionate hunter.

3013
02:44:08.051 --> 02:44:10.530
I'm doing it because I'm a businessman.
I don't want to make a pile of money,

3014
02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:11.230
you know?

3015
02:44:11.230 --> 02:44:14.530
And it had just how it happens to be a sport that I love and I'm passionate

3016
02:44:14.531 --> 02:44:16.770
about and that's going to help me be a better business person.

3017
02:44:16.770 --> 02:44:18.760
And people don't know that under Armour does hunting gear.

3018
02:44:18.820 --> 02:44:20.320
They're huge in the hunting world.

3019
02:44:20.770 --> 02:44:23.790
People think of them as terms of other athletics.
Yeah.
Were there.

3020
02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:27.850
Just kidding me.
We just announced the coming soon have their new a ridge reaper,

3021
02:44:27.851 --> 02:44:30.720
Barron Barron Cammo pattern,
Remy and I,
and there's,

3022
02:44:30.721 --> 02:44:34.630
there's like six or eight of us nationwide that had these prototype clothings

3023
02:44:34.631 --> 02:44:38.920
and the war,
this cammo pattern.
Cameron's Cameron's got it as well and uh,

3024
02:44:39.430 --> 02:44:41.110
they just announced that it's going to be releasing it.

3025
02:44:41.140 --> 02:44:43.960
I heard the September 15th,
one of the dates was thrown out,

3026
02:44:43.961 --> 02:44:47.230
but they're going to be coming out with that,
uh,
at a underarmour.com.

3027
02:44:47.550 --> 02:44:50.530
The Ridge reaper line with the baron cammo pattern.
Pretty sweet.

3028
02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:53.470
Do you ever go out and realize that you fucked up?

3029
02:44:53.471 --> 02:44:57.910
You should have brought more shit always.
Really?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's happened.

3030
02:44:57.940 --> 02:45:00.400
And it's also gone the other way too where I've gotten there and I'm like,

3031
02:45:00.401 --> 02:45:04.600
why did I bring this mostly camera stuff?
I mean I pack around this five pound,

3032
02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:08.320
11,000 millimeter,
whatever it 1100 millimeter lens,

3033
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:12.580
the weighs like six pounds.
I pack that sucker everywhere and I'd never use it.

3034
02:45:12.900 --> 02:45:15.910
And it's like,
why am I packing that thing and my spot and scope and all this?

3035
02:45:15.911 --> 02:45:18.480
It's like,
is there anything that you like when,

3036
02:45:18.490 --> 02:45:21.820
like if you haven't brought it with you,
like if you had gone out there and go,

3037
02:45:21.821 --> 02:45:24.820
God,
why didn't I bring this?
Is there anything like dangerous about that?

3038
02:45:24.821 --> 02:45:25.654
Have you ever taken,

3039
02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:29.800
if you ever like taken a trip and not having enough clothing or not having

3040
02:45:29.801 --> 02:45:33.130
enough?
Yeah.
Um,
survival shit.

3041
02:45:33.550 --> 02:45:36.670
I always have survival stuff with me.
I carry a survival medic.

3042
02:45:36.700 --> 02:45:40.000
It's just a little,
a super lightweight first aid kit,

3043
02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:43.360
but it has survival tools with it too,
you know?
So I have that in every,

3044
02:45:43.420 --> 02:45:46.780
I've got one in every backpack I use that's just there,
like start fires.

3045
02:45:47.050 --> 02:45:50.170
Thankfully I rarely have to use it,
you know?
And if I do use it,

3046
02:45:50.171 --> 02:45:52.180
it's just more just for fun to start a fire or something.

3047
02:45:52.181 --> 02:45:54.930
But it's there if I do need it.
Um,

3048
02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:57.700
I don't know what I've run into a situation where it's like,
man,

3049
02:45:57.701 --> 02:46:02.220
I wished I would have had this or that.
Um,
cause it's such,

3050
02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:03.720
yes.
Dot.
Yeah,
hunting.

3051
02:46:03.730 --> 02:46:08.050
So few people do that that way where you go completely on your own.

3052
02:46:08.140 --> 02:46:10.460
Well and I grew hunting with nothing.
You know,

3053
02:46:10.461 --> 02:46:14.240
I had a bow with piece of crap arrows and it was the cheapest thing we could

3054
02:46:14.241 --> 02:46:15.890
find and I hunted with that same boat.

3055
02:46:15.891 --> 02:46:18.350
The boat that I bought when I was 14 was the first,

3056
02:46:18.380 --> 02:46:22.010
I think all I have been 15 I bought that Bo.
I hunted with that until I was,

3057
02:46:22.220 --> 02:46:26.300
until I got into TV till 2004 it was a compound or a compound bow barely.

3058
02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:29.840
It was a Polaris,
a PSE Polaris that I bought that bow.

3059
02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:33.420
It was like $109 or something.
A hundred feet per second.
I don't know.

3060
02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:36.110
I don't know,
maybe who knows.

3061
02:46:36.410 --> 02:46:38.960
But I hunted with that thing and then I got back out of college.

3062
02:46:38.961 --> 02:46:42.110
I was talking with that thing and I got a hundred with that clear til 2004

3063
02:46:42.111 --> 02:46:46.980
before I got a Mathews bow and I'm like,
holy cow,
there's a,
there's a 12 year,

3064
02:46:47.420 --> 02:46:50.090
15 year span of time there that I hunted with a piece of crap.

3065
02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:55.600
And so I think that by me learning to get by with so little that it makes it

3066
02:46:56.241 --> 02:47:00.020
easier for me.
When I do have good equipment,
I can appreciate it that much more.

3067
02:47:00.021 --> 02:47:03.020
And it's like I can get by with just a good just good equipment.

3068
02:47:03.260 --> 02:47:07.520
The world of hunting gadgets,
compound bows is,

3069
02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:11.330
that's the oneworld where 10 years makes a giant leap.

3070
02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:15.530
Whereas like with rifles 10 years ago,
it's a rifle.

3071
02:47:16.460 --> 02:47:20.720
Scopes are a little better,
but rifles essentially a rifle,
bullets are bullets,

3072
02:47:21.020 --> 02:47:25.070
but the,
the bows of 10 years ago in comparison to the bowser today,

3073
02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:29.810
I mean they are making these little incremental leaps like every year where

3074
02:47:29.811 --> 02:47:32.510
they're getting a little bit lighter,
a little bit more feet per second,

3075
02:47:32.511 --> 02:47:35.120
a little bit more accurate,
a little bit better tolerance.

3076
02:47:35.450 --> 02:47:38.960
It's really kind of interesting to see the technology that's involved in

3077
02:47:38.961 --> 02:47:41.300
compound bows,
both for target shooting and for hunting.

3078
02:47:41.630 --> 02:47:44.750
And it's interesting that the bow company that I deal with with chief five and

3079
02:47:44.751 --> 02:47:48.470
prime is like g five is an engineering firm.
You know,

3080
02:47:48.471 --> 02:47:49.730
they're an engineering company.

3081
02:47:49.731 --> 02:47:53.900
So if anybody's going to know how to make something better and to get the most

3082
02:47:53.901 --> 02:47:55.220
out of a piece of iron,

3083
02:47:55.490 --> 02:47:58.130
it's an engineering company is somebody that has that background.

3084
02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:00.920
So that's what's really cool about them.
And these companies are smart.

3085
02:48:00.921 --> 02:48:04.340
They're not just going to just blow their wad on all our technology all at once.

3086
02:48:04.460 --> 02:48:07.280
They're going to incrementally bring it out so they can have a new bow every

3087
02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:09.890
year.
And that seems to be like the craze right now is every,

3088
02:48:09.950 --> 02:48:13.940
every bow manufacturer has one or two new bows every year.
And it's like,
man,
how,

3089
02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.970
how do you keep up with that?
Well how to keep up with technology.

3090
02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:20.150
But as a hunter,
I'm kind of addicted that it's like,
yeah,
I like this bow.

3091
02:48:20.151 --> 02:48:24.170
But in October,
as soon as that new prototype bow comes out,
I want it in my hand,

3092
02:48:24.171 --> 02:48:26.750
you know,
because we're addicted to that new,
bigger,
better,

3093
02:48:26.751 --> 02:48:28.370
badder just like the iPhone six,
you know,

3094
02:48:28.371 --> 02:48:31.970
mark was telling me about that and I'm like you were mocking the iPhone four.

3095
02:48:32.030 --> 02:48:34.280
Yeah I got an iPhone four you know,

3096
02:48:34.370 --> 02:48:36.560
you haven't even had a format for like forever.

3097
02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:40.550
He went crazy lens attachment that you put on your,
uh,
I've seen that too.

3098
02:48:40.551 --> 02:48:43.670
You put it on a spot and scope and you can film it.
Right.

3099
02:48:43.700 --> 02:48:47.240
What does that cause a phone scope adapter and I've just gotten used to having

3100
02:48:47.241 --> 02:48:49.760
it on my phone every once in while I'll take my phone out and put it back in my

3101
02:48:49.761 --> 02:48:52.550
life proof case.
But then I reached in my pocket.
I'm like,
where's my handle?

3102
02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:56.690
I'm missing my handle.
But this is just an adaptor.
It goes onto a bayonet mount,

3103
02:48:56.750 --> 02:49:00.440
a sleeve.
So I can slide it over my spotting scope or,

3104
02:49:00.470 --> 02:49:03.890
and you can zoom in,
you can video.
Yeah,
take pictures.

3105
02:49:03.891 --> 02:49:07.380
And what's cool is you shoot a little video clip or take a photo and Bam you to

3106
02:49:07.381 --> 02:49:08.310
Instagram,
Wham,

3107
02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:10.350
<v 0>you're done.
And that kind of stuff.
So that's pretty cool.</v>

3108
02:49:10.351 --> 02:49:14.270
So you take a photo from straight from the spotting scope.
Exactly,
yeah.

3109
02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:16.230
Does digital scoping with it.

3110
02:49:16.231 --> 02:49:19.920
And I just leave it in the case because you know my phone,

3111
02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:22.880
I just like having that handle.
It's just kinda convenient.
Yeah,

3112
02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:26.350
I love it because when I take it off I'm like missing it.
And it's not that I,

3113
02:49:26.430 --> 02:49:28.470
I don't use this phone scope other than when I'm hunting.

3114
02:49:28.471 --> 02:49:32.150
So it's like when you were talking for folks who don't know what you were
saying,

3115
02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:36.600
you were talking about ranging these laser range finders are another really cool

3116
02:49:36.601 --> 02:49:40.290
invention where you look into it,
you press a button,

3117
02:49:40.291 --> 02:49:41.790
it tells you the exact yardage.

3118
02:49:42.060 --> 02:49:44.640
And for people who've never been hunting with bows before,

3119
02:49:44.641 --> 02:49:47.490
it never shot a bow before.
They don't understand the,

3120
02:49:47.620 --> 02:49:51.000
like there's a big difference between a scope on a rifle.

3121
02:49:51.150 --> 02:49:55.170
A rifle is pretty good for a couple of hundred yards,
but a bow,

3122
02:49:55.320 --> 02:49:58.740
there's a big difference between where it's going to hit at 20 yards versus

3123
02:49:58.741 --> 02:50:00.300
where it's going to hit at 40 yards.

3124
02:50:00.690 --> 02:50:05.690
And all of this is sort of crazy calculations on feet per second and where your

3125
02:50:06.031 --> 02:50:08.460
yardage pins are and it's I,

3126
02:50:08.461 --> 02:50:12.450
that was one thing that I really got into when I started playing with Bose,

3127
02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:14.970
who's helped how much you have to learn,

3128
02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:18.660
like develop a site tape and you know,
and,
and,

3129
02:50:18.661 --> 02:50:23.661
and the range things out and figure out like siting in your bow and making sure

3130
02:50:23.731 --> 02:50:26.940
everything's tuned up and it's,
there's,
there's so,

3131
02:50:26.970 --> 02:50:31.470
so many weird adjustments that you have to make between 20 and 50 yards and how

3132
02:50:31.471 --> 02:50:35.070
difficult it is to shoot something at 50 yards.
Yeah,
just a target.

3133
02:50:35.100 --> 02:50:38.010
You don't have a steady rest.
There are bi-pod like you do with a rifle.

3134
02:50:38.010 --> 02:50:38.970
I mean the bow you've got,

3135
02:50:39.060 --> 02:50:43.080
you've got your arm that's not very rigid to begin with holding it out there and

3136
02:50:43.081 --> 02:50:46.920
you've got your other arm back here and so you're trying to anchor it and no

3137
02:50:46.921 --> 02:50:49.380
magnification either.
No you can't.
There's,

3138
02:50:49.381 --> 02:50:51.780
there's some magnification scopes out there,
you know,

3139
02:50:51.781 --> 02:50:56.040
that you could put on there.
One or two power,
six power,
whatever.
I don't,

3140
02:50:56.730 --> 02:50:59.040
I'm so old school when it comes to my equipment,

3141
02:50:59.070 --> 02:51:02.910
I mean it's just like I'll take a bow and I set up all my own equipment.

3142
02:51:02.911 --> 02:51:03.770
I don't take it into the,

3143
02:51:03.771 --> 02:51:06.660
the archery shops because everybody has their own way of doing things.

3144
02:51:06.661 --> 02:51:10.470
But I do it the way I learned,
but I'll just put a peep sight,
you know,

3145
02:51:10.620 --> 02:51:13.030
cited in the guys are guys are all wrapped into these,

3146
02:51:13.031 --> 02:51:14.760
these super long range sites.
Well,

3147
02:51:14.940 --> 02:51:18.150
I'm a hunter so I need a site that's going to go from 20 to 80 you know,

3148
02:51:18.151 --> 02:51:22.640
and I'm good.
I don't need 120 a hundred Fishman,
these rolling single pane.

3149
02:51:22.650 --> 02:51:25.290
Be Fun to shoot that far,
but I don't if I want to shoot that far,

3150
02:51:25.291 --> 02:51:29.160
I go get my Moa rifle and I shoot that far.
You know it's like,
well I,
you know,

3151
02:51:29.161 --> 02:51:30.480
I learned from Cameron.

3152
02:51:30.481 --> 02:51:34.110
Cameron does all of his hunting with bows and arrows help and Cameron Hanes

3153
02:51:34.240 --> 02:51:38.580
never heard of him.
He uses a spot Hogg who you never heard of her camera NHANES.

3154
02:51:38.730 --> 02:51:41.070
You keep doing that shit joke.
You're going to have to let that go.

3155
02:51:41.071 --> 02:51:45.090
We're almost done here.
That's like my joke.
But um,

3156
02:51:45.120 --> 02:51:47.070
do you use multi Pinsight?
Yeah,

3157
02:51:47.490 --> 02:51:51.450
do for the longest time I just use a single pin site but once I started really

3158
02:51:51.451 --> 02:51:55.920
filming my bow hunts real heavily to just became too much to have to adjust that

3159
02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:59.850
pin.
So I just went to the multiple pin sites again so that I don't have any

3160
02:51:59.851 --> 02:52:02.610
adjustment on the bow.
I can focus on adjusting the camera.

3161
02:52:03.030 --> 02:52:06.130
When you said that you just cited in the animal,
you didn't

3162
02:52:06.130 --> 02:52:10.540
<v 2>even cite it in,
you just just looked at it and you just take a an an estimate.</v>

3163
02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:13.390
Is that something that just comes over time?
Like you look at something go,

3164
02:52:13.391 --> 02:52:17.980
that's about 30 yards until I was 25 years old,
I didn't use sites.

3165
02:52:18.010 --> 02:52:19.630
It was all instinctive.
So every,

3166
02:52:19.660 --> 02:52:22.480
every time I would shoot about his fingers and it was bare bow instinctive,

3167
02:52:22.481 --> 02:52:24.850
even though it was compound,
everything was instinctive.

3168
02:52:24.851 --> 02:52:27.640
And so I think it just ingrains into you if you're a traditional shooter or

3169
02:52:27.641 --> 02:52:31.900
whatever,
when you draw back your,
like your body,
just like shooting a pistol,

3170
02:52:31.901 --> 02:52:33.910
you know your body automatically gets into that position.

3171
02:52:34.300 --> 02:52:35.620
And more times than not,
if you'll,

3172
02:52:35.621 --> 02:52:38.230
if you'll draw back and get in that position and then look at your pins,

3173
02:52:38.350 --> 02:52:40.570
you're there.
You mean here if,
if you,

3174
02:52:40.600 --> 02:52:43.660
you've done it a lot in your condition to that and I think that's where your

3175
02:52:43.661 --> 02:52:46.690
instincts kind of take over.
And in those cases I drew back and I,
and I,

3176
02:52:46.691 --> 02:52:51.070
you just look at your pin,
verify Bam.
You know,
and you go,
so you're still aiming.

3177
02:52:51.520 --> 02:52:55.660
But because you're not thinking about it,
it's happening so much quicker.

3178
02:52:55.661 --> 02:52:57.880
They say that that's,
you know what,
some of the sharp shooters,

3179
02:52:57.881 --> 02:53:01.150
that's why they're so good is because it's just all instinctive with pistols or

3180
02:53:01.151 --> 02:53:02.770
anything else.
They're not aiming.
There's just shooting.

3181
02:53:03.160 --> 02:53:06.520
There's a lot of practice involved in bow hunting too,
right?
I,
I've had a boat.

3182
02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:09.430
I started bow hunting as the 1213 years old.
You know,
I have had,

3183
02:53:09.490 --> 02:53:13.090
I've had a bow in my hand my entire life.
Basically,
I'm just,

3184
02:53:13.091 --> 02:53:14.950
because of my upbringing,
I'd go out to do chores.

3185
02:53:14.951 --> 02:53:16.270
You grab your bow off of the freezer,

3186
02:53:16.271 --> 02:53:20.020
you walk out filling a couple arrows at the carpet target that we had taped onto

3187
02:53:20.021 --> 02:53:22.710
the haystack,
and you'd go milk the cows.
You walk out,
you pull your arrows,

3188
02:53:22.740 --> 02:53:27.520
you do it again.
It was lifestyle.
It's,
it's life for me growing up that way,

3189
02:53:27.760 --> 02:53:31.360
I shoot less now just because of the business of life and the other other

3190
02:53:31.361 --> 02:53:35.500
responsibilities I have.
But it's still,
it's still part of it and it's natural.

3191
02:53:35.530 --> 02:53:37.530
So for a guy picking it up,
for you to go out and,

3192
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:41.650
and be able to experience that instinctive anchoring and everything is just

3193
02:53:41.651 --> 02:53:43.690
dialed,
it's going to come over time,
you know?

3194
02:53:43.720 --> 02:53:46.840
And there'll be times where you might go out next week and you're like,
man,

3195
02:53:46.841 --> 02:53:48.640
I know what he's talking about.
That feels good.

3196
02:53:48.641 --> 02:53:51.010
And then the next day you're gonna be like,
what the hell am I doing wrong?

3197
02:53:51.011 --> 02:53:53.200
This just isn't working.
And that's our tree.
That's,

3198
02:53:53.360 --> 02:53:56.320
that's the nature of your bow.
Your,
your,
your wrist is going to tweak.

3199
02:53:56.500 --> 02:53:58.510
Things are gonna change and from day to day.

3200
02:53:58.540 --> 02:54:01.750
So don't feel like you have to adjust your bow every time you go out and shoot.

3201
02:54:01.900 --> 02:54:04.300
Just be like,
Yup,
today I was pulling them left.
You know,

3202
02:54:04.840 --> 02:54:07.920
today I'm dropping them out.
No big deal.
Tomorrow will be a different,
you know.

3203
02:54:08.230 --> 02:54:11.470
Well,
that's the cool thing about archery is how difficult it is.
It's so,

3204
02:54:11.500 --> 02:54:16.270
it's so involved that it sort of takes away all the other things in your life

3205
02:54:16.271 --> 02:54:19.420
away.
It takes away all the other things you were thinking about,

3206
02:54:19.421 --> 02:54:20.890
all the other distractions in your mind.

3207
02:54:20.891 --> 02:54:24.940
You're so concentrating on putting that pin,
holding it steady,

3208
02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:28.870
making sure you release no,
no added movement,
no,

3209
02:54:28.900 --> 02:54:31.870
no twitching node polling.
And it's,

3210
02:54:31.900 --> 02:54:35.920
I find it like almost like meditative in that way.
And when I do it,
I,

3211
02:54:35.921 --> 02:54:39.670
it cleans my mind out.
I love doing it.
At the end of the day,
I have a busy day.

3212
02:54:39.970 --> 02:54:43.900
I go out in my yard,
I,
you know,
pull out some targets and start shooting.

3213
02:54:44.140 --> 02:54:46.840
And I feel like it's a nice stress reliever too.

3214
02:54:46.930 --> 02:54:48.040
Even if people never want to hunt.

3215
02:54:48.310 --> 02:54:52.330
I recommend a dude just doing archery just for fun and get a bowl and do it

3216
02:54:52.331 --> 02:54:53.020
instinctively.

3217
02:54:53.020 --> 02:54:56.470
You should get a recurve or get a bare boat and just go out and just do it
close,

3218
02:54:56.471 --> 02:55:01.290
you know,
10,
10 feet and just get that feeling of just release.
It helps your,

3219
02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:05.150
it helps.
It'll help your I so because I grew up that,
I mean that's,

3220
02:55:05.180 --> 02:55:07.190
that's how I did it.
And,
and you know,

3221
02:55:07.191 --> 02:55:10.370
to this day I think it's made me a better shooter in a hunting situation.

3222
02:55:10.430 --> 02:55:15.430
It's tricky to hunt with a bow because more animals get wounded and escape bow

3223
02:55:15.861 --> 02:55:19.690
hunting than probably any other style.
I don't know.
Yeah.

3224
02:55:19.700 --> 02:55:21.410
I don't know what this to take some and there's a lot of,

3225
02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:24.620
a lot of deer get hammered by a rifle to and walk away.
It's hard.
Sure.

3226
02:55:24.621 --> 02:55:27.500
It's hard to say.
There's just that many more rifle hunters out there.

3227
02:55:27.530 --> 02:55:30.950
Bows are tough because hemorrhaging is lethal.
You don't,
hemorrhaging is,

3228
02:55:31.010 --> 02:55:33.740
I mean you can shoot,
I shot a bear in the ankle one time,
you know,

3229
02:55:33.741 --> 02:55:38.150
when the wrist bled out with an 80 yards,
you know,
hemorrhaging is super lethal,

3230
02:55:38.151 --> 02:55:41.600
whereas a bullet,
it doesn't necessarily have to give you hemorrhaging.

3231
02:55:41.630 --> 02:55:44.540
It can give you puncture an impact and,
and shock and trauma.

3232
02:55:44.810 --> 02:55:47.970
But it doesn't necessarily hemorrhage not the same way because of the heat and

3233
02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:52.340
the cauterized and yeah,
it could,
could be.
So,
I don't know.
I can't,

3234
02:55:52.490 --> 02:55:55.270
can't say for sure.
Yeah.
I just had a,

3235
02:55:55.280 --> 02:55:58.730
I felt I had a massive responsibility to put it in a lot of practice for

3236
02:55:58.731 --> 02:56:01.480
everyone.
Bow Hunting and I mean it was,
I,
I,

3237
02:56:01.610 --> 02:56:05.930
I fucked my shoulder up because I was shooting 150 hours hours a day.

3238
02:56:05.970 --> 02:56:08.150
Don't pull the Cameron Cameron Hanes is it,

3239
02:56:08.210 --> 02:56:11.330
don't pull the Cameron Hanes and shoot or 90 pound bow shoot a 70 pound.

3240
02:56:12.020 --> 02:56:16.910
All you need is 70 is that all you need?
I had a 1744 to five you know,

3241
02:56:17.210 --> 02:56:20.450
but do you,
because what have you hit a bone and then the animal runs away.

3242
02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:23.110
Cameron has this,
this philosophy about pat.

3243
02:56:23.300 --> 02:56:25.700
Well he never just the guy's philosophy,
you know,
and that's great.

3244
02:56:25.701 --> 02:56:30.010
And it works for him.
Sweet.
And I just knew Jen has the 45 pound philosophy,

3245
02:56:30.030 --> 02:56:32.180
whatever.
He's got a Ted Nugent's got his,
what do you shoot?

3246
02:56:32.181 --> 02:56:35.920
A 70 I shoot mine at like 63 pounds or something.
Yeah.

my set up.
