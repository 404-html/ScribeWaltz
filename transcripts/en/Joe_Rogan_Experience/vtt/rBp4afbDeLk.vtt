6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.511
<v Speaker 2>conversation with Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Become an example to me of how squirly </v>

7
00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:24.740
<v Speaker 2>things have gotten lately with the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>people interpret conversations about </v>

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 2>ideas because of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

<v Speaker 2>a community guideline strike just for </v>

<v Speaker 2>I just assumed I'm,</v>

17
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm part of the problem.</v>

18
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Part of the Patriarchy pet are Kaye cee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cee x on twitter.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Azura screen name on twitter and got a </v>

20
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 2>community guideline strike for just </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting this.</v>

21
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Now I brought this up too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was having dinner with some friends.</v>

22
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:16.821
<v Speaker 2>One of them who used to work at Google </v>
<v Speaker 2>and someone who's there was a highly </v>

23
00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:17.260
<v Speaker 2>ranked person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

24
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought this up and the exact quote </v>

25
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>that was because it's hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

27
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>you said that so flippantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

28
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>please tell me the contents of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

29
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what they talked about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

30
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:37.451
<v Speaker 1>how did you say that she was white?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure if someone marked it as a </v>

31
00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:41.631
<v Speaker 1>community guideline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strike a community strike.</v>

32
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:46.641
<v Speaker 1>What is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The community guidelines that they must </v>

33
00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>be hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

34
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>do you understand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Douglas Murray and Sam Harris.</v>

35
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

36
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I bet that's not what the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>was about.</v>

37
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I bet it wasn't too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think of what we did.</v>

38
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Talk about it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's making me nervous.</v>

39
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that.</v>

40
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely wasn't hate speech by any </v>

41
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 1>saying definition of those words that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

42
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>this sort of thing is very disturbing.</v>

43
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Very disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and you noticed that happening with </v>

44
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>other people and that's disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough is more disturbing.</v>

45
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Of course it happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's real.</v>

46
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Sam Harris a bit,</v>

47
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>not a hateful person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my most sorta yoga calm,</v>

48
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>blissed out west coast of America </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>

49
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.700
<v Speaker 1>and I'm pretty amazed that anyone at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google or anyone else would think that </v>

50
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>anything that could come out of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth with hate speech,</v>

51
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.150
<v Speaker 1>hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you decided that hate speech is </v>

52
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.731
<v Speaker 1>just anything you'd personally don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like or the words don't matter anymore.</v>

53
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm concerned about.</v>

54
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned that</v>

55
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.320
<v Speaker 2>there is an agenda that people who work </v>
<v Speaker 2>in these.</v>

56
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 2>We don't even have to name the </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations,</v>

57
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.880
<v Speaker 2>but in certain organizations are</v>

58
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.010
<v Speaker 3>left leaning and I mean it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>better than being extremely </v>

59
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 3>right-leaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it really is.</v>

60
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 3>It's probably better than them being </v>
<v Speaker 3>white supremacists,</v>

61
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 3>white nationalists hate groups probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>far better that they're radical lefties,</v>

62
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.640
<v Speaker 3>but it becomes a problem when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing things like that because things </v>

63
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 3>like that limit free speech and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>limit the free discussion of ideas.</v>

64
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't listen to your conversation.</v>

65
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 3>I think I listened to a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

66
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:32.791
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't listen to enough of it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know whether or not you guys started </v>

67
00:03:32.791 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 3>screaming at the end word halfway in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I'd remember.</v>

68
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you would have this moment.</v>

69
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 3>I had another thing that I talked about </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this same person.</v>

70
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 3>I brought up Jordan Peterson and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that there's.</v>

71
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 3>There's issues with every time he's on </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>

72
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:56.461
<v Speaker 3>the podcast get flagged for </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonetization and the exact words were,</v>

73
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.861
<v Speaker 3>he's a troublemaker and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck are you talking about?</v>

74
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 3>Like are you listening to his </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations?</v>

75
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:09.001
<v Speaker 3>He is very articulate and he's extremely</v>
<v Speaker 3>careful going over these ideas that I </v>

76
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:16.681
<v Speaker 3>think we should all be discussing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to call this hate speech or to call </v>

77
00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 3>someone a troublemaker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It to me,</v>

78
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 3>it's simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simplify or symbolizes what we're.</v>

79
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.460
<v Speaker 3>What we're dealing with today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a very strange time when it </v>

80
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.251
<v Speaker 3>comes to communication and the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that regulate and distributed </v>

81
00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:29.251
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>

82
00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:33.410
<v Speaker 1>It is whenever I've had a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak with people in that kind of world </v>

83
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.650
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question I always want to ask him on</v>

84
00:04:37.651 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 1>other things is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know where this is going to lead?</v>

85
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what it's going to do if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep breaking down definitions and terms</v>

86
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>and words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know what happens?</v>

87
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the road,</v>

88
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:53.521
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you keep on saying that Sam Harris </v>

89
00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 1>and Doris Martin having a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>about something is hate speech.</v>

90
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what relief that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give other people down the road about </v>

91
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>what they're going to be able to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with?</v>

92
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 1>This is what's being created all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

93
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:08.011
<v Speaker 1>In the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me there's this idea that </v>

94
00:05:08.011 --> 00:05:09.901
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you police the discussion along </v>

95
00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:12.691
<v Speaker 1>incredibly narrow lines that happened to</v>
<v Speaker 1>surround your own comfort zone and call </v>

96
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:15.770
<v Speaker 1>everything outside.</v>

97
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not just stuff I don't agree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>or things that I would argue with or </v>

98
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.440
<v Speaker 1>debate with hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

99
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think very,</v>

100
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:27.991
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous down the road you can see</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the trail that bit of gunpowder </v>

101
00:05:27.991 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>goes to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

102
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think it goes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it goes to the point where </v>

103
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.891
<v Speaker 1>people become cynical about any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any claims made about anyone and the </v>

104
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:43.471
<v Speaker 1>likelihood is that if 99 times you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen Sam Harris started with Mary Joe </v>

105
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson,</v>

106
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:49.501
<v Speaker 1>whoever called hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the hundredth time that somebody </v>

107
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:55.501
<v Speaker 1>uses the term hate speech might be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who is engaging in hate speech </v>

108
00:05:55.501 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>and all your defenses are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

109
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.040
<v Speaker 1>You've got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're very likely to become a very </v>

110
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.040
<v Speaker 1>unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to become skeptical.</v>

111
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and think I'm really gonna dig that.</v>

112
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:10.571
<v Speaker 1>Most of us don't have time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have time to find out every </v>

113
00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 1>single thought and words someone has </v>
<v Speaker 1>uttered or thought.</v>

114
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>And so it seems very likely to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the road very,</v>

115
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:21.851
<v Speaker 1>very bad people were able to get through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gates because we kept on making </v>

116
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:27.011
<v Speaker 1>erroneous claims frivolously for our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>short term gain and fro in short term </v>

117
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:32.501
<v Speaker 1>comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll end up basically bringing the </v>

118
00:06:32.501 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>gates down completely.</v>

119
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's been a lot of discussion</v>

120
00:06:36.011 --> 00:06:41.011
<v Speaker 2>lately as well that I agree with where </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you make these ridiculous claims </v>

121
00:06:43.331 --> 00:06:45.240
<v Speaker 2>about conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

122
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.290
<v Speaker 2>you empower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually empower radical people </v>

123
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 2>posed left wing ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

124
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.840
<v Speaker 2>They get more extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You empower the extremists because they </v>

125
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.680
<v Speaker 2>know that you're incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have evidence of it.</v>

126
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.540
<v Speaker 2>They see your ridiculous behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other really disturbing aspect of it</v>

127
00:07:01.541 --> 00:07:04.870
<v Speaker 2>as these are the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributing speech,</v>

128
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about how many discussions </v>

129
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.190
<v Speaker 2>are viewed daily on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stunning</v>

130
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

131
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much.</v>

132
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at the beginning of this.</v>

133
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:22.541
<v Speaker 1>I don't wait because I mean there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long way for this to run a long way for </v>

134
00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:25.631
<v Speaker 1>the censorship to run the long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't help thinking among other </v>

135
00:07:25.631 --> 00:07:28.871
<v Speaker 1>things that the people trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules at the moment have no idea of </v>

136
00:07:28.871 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 1>the fact that these debates have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened before.</v>

137
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have not bothered to look into them and </v>

138
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.440
<v Speaker 1>seem to think that history started with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

139
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.280
<v Speaker 1>And I just wish that among other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>with social media,</v>

140
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 1>people realized w we have been through </v>
<v Speaker 1>this several times before at least,</v>

141
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:48.911
<v Speaker 1>and the lessons are pretty clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not that you can limit speech in </v>

142
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:54.260
<v Speaker 1>order to obtain political nirvana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

143
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.760
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor are they,</v>

144
00:07:55.761 --> 00:07:58.160
<v Speaker 1>that you can simply use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

145
00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:01.160
<v Speaker 1>for short term gain accusations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:02.100
<v Speaker 1>to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

147
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 1>In order to further a short term </v>
<v Speaker 1>political goal,</v>

148
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know all this.</v>

149
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 1>We've been through a printing press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went through with John Stuart Mill.</v>

150
00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:18.041
<v Speaker 1>We went through it with Milton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wish these people had any idea of</v>

151
00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:21.640
<v Speaker 1>the fact that history started before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents can see them.</v>

152
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such that the whole culture of tech</v>

153
00:08:26.641 --> 00:08:29.850
<v Speaker 2>today is such a progressive thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble.</v>

154
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.790
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an echo chamber and it's very,</v>

155
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.580
<v Speaker 2>very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

156
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better that they're really </v>

157
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.960
<v Speaker 2>progressive and open minded and left </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wayne and radical right wing.</v>

158
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.110
<v Speaker 2>I think it's better.</v>

159
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

160
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:42.580
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

161
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.780
<v Speaker 1>if by radical right wing you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

162
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.680
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although these people have all,</v>

163
00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:53.260
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the ability to create those people,</v>

164
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

165
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.660
<v Speaker 1>which is power it empower them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something you don't want actual</v>

166
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:05.001
<v Speaker 1>racists and Nazis to have legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>grievance claims and you don't want them</v>

167
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:09.030
<v Speaker 1>to be able to disguise themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something they're not.</v>

168
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.600
<v Speaker 1>So I say I had a friend who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

169
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.020
<v Speaker 1>a lot of friends involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Northern Ireland conflict in many years </v>

170
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:18.020
<v Speaker 1>ago in the UK and all that many years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

171
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.240
<v Speaker 1>one writer had a beautiful phrase about </v>
<v Speaker 1>w w where you've got the stage wherever </v>

172
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.281
<v Speaker 1>I was killing everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said you also got to the stage where </v>

173
00:09:27.281 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 1>truth was whatever you were having </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

174
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.630
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not far away from that.</v>

175
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>That place where I say what you call is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate speech.</v>

176
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:40.770
<v Speaker 1>You see what I say is hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's call the whole thing off.</v>

177
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 1>We're not very far away from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

178
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

179
00:09:45.911 --> 00:09:49.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange that this,</v>

180
00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:51.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this echo chamber is being so reinforced</v>

181
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.820
<v Speaker 2>and that very few people are stepping </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and saying,</v>

182
00:09:54.821 --> 00:09:55.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

183
00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Subjectively know the people that do do </v>

184
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.871
<v Speaker 2>that are signaled out as being racist or</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist or homophobic or transphobic or </v>

185
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

186
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.700
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever is convenient.</v>

187
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

188
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's not surprising that more people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to stick their heads up.</v>

189
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 1>That's perfect because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a normal job,</v>

190
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:19.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you worked in a normal office or sharp </v>

191
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:19.250
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

192
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 1>you really don't want this coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards you,</v>

193
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

194
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.240
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

195
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:29.241
<v Speaker 1>this can tear apart and tear down people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who spend a lifetime demonstrating they </v>

196
00:10:29.901 --> 00:10:31.980
<v Speaker 1>are not the thing that they're being </v>
<v Speaker 1>accused of.</v>

197
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:36.981
<v Speaker 1>So if nobody knows anything about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no particular persona out </v>

198
00:10:36.981 --> 00:10:38.700
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no particular back record.</v>

199
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't want this and coming to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life down,</v>

200
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because recovering from that accusation </v>

201
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 1>is almost impossible and will take you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever it is basically impossible.</v>

202
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:51.900
<v Speaker 1>And all that you do along the way is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep reminding people of the charge.</v>

203
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.900
<v Speaker 1>And if you were to ever win on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>technicality,</v>

204
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:56.820
<v Speaker 1>like everyone would have forgotten the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

205
00:10:56.821 --> 00:10:57.480
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

206
00:10:57.481 --> 00:10:59.340
<v Speaker 1>that's the racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the rapist.</v>

207
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was pro rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't remember him.</v>

208
00:11:02.691 --> 00:11:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so simple,</v>

209
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:04.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

210
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.360
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we're in some strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>adolescent stage of communication and </v>

211
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.040
<v Speaker 2>there's been a bunch of talk lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

212
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.680
<v Speaker 2>There were some something that I tweeted</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier today,</v>

213
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.860
<v Speaker 2>some new technology that they believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>were ai is going to allow people to </v>

214
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:26.110
<v Speaker 2>literally see other people's thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right and I am forever optimistic but </v>

215
00:11:30.081 --> 00:11:35.081
<v Speaker 2>also terrified and my feeling is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>our transition from language,</v>

216
00:11:36.051 --> 00:11:41.051
<v Speaker 2>here it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new ai system can see what you are </v>

217
00:11:41.051 --> 00:11:43.571
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just what the hell does that </v>

218
00:11:43.571 --> 00:11:44.930
<v Speaker 2>mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm I'm concern,</v>

219
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.960
<v Speaker 2>but also optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we're in this transitionary </v>

220
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.680
<v Speaker 2>period from regular communication to </v>
<v Speaker 2>written communication,</v>

221
00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 2>to written communication on line</v>

222
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speech online,</v>

223
00:11:55.841 --> 00:12:00.841
<v Speaker 3>video online where there's this instant </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to all this and these ideas are </v>

224
00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:05.491
<v Speaker 3>being debated and tossed around like </v>
<v Speaker 3>beach balls in real time and ideas are </v>

225
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:10.801
<v Speaker 3>being distorted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People's positions are being distorted </v>

226
00:12:10.801 --> 00:12:14.840
<v Speaker 3>for for other people's gains and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is this willful misuse of the </v>

227
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:20.611
<v Speaker 3>truth and that something is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come along that's going to combat that,</v>

228
00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:24.660
<v Speaker 3>but at what price?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the.</v>

229
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.800
<v Speaker 3>I can't see what would come along to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it other than people rebelling against </v>

230
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.280
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their own free will as it was.</v>

231
00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.010
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem like that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

232
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:38.040
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there's a few people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are rec like yourself and there's many </v>

233
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.160
<v Speaker 3>others that are recognizing the problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this.</v>

234
00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:40.990
<v Speaker 3>There's people talking about the problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it online,</v>

235
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:46.230
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part the mass of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are engaged in this and it's also it's </v>

236
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:48.250
<v Speaker 3>idea sport.</v>

237
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.290
<v Speaker 3>There's idea sport going on where their </v>
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

238
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.030
<v Speaker 3>they want their side to score.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>

239
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:54.150
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

240
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.720
<v Speaker 3>that's always old politics and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>country at any rate at the moment is how</v>

241
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 3>can we make sure that the other side </v>
<v Speaker 3>trips up on this,</v>

242
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.830
<v Speaker 3>and I've felt this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've written this all through the me,</v>

243
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.240
<v Speaker 3>an era that in your country and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>

244
00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:14.860
<v Speaker 3>people are basically are willing to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>for somebody who is a political opponent</v>

245
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:19.861
<v Speaker 3>who does something very minimal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're willing to defend somebody on </v>

246
00:13:19.861 --> 00:13:22.660
<v Speaker 3>the inside who does something bigger and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see it all the time.</v>

247
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.180
<v Speaker 3>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are different standards that apply</v>

248
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:30.181
<v Speaker 3>to your own side then apply to the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people don't seem to be hiding it </v>

249
00:13:30.181 --> 00:13:33.961
<v Speaker 3>very much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not at all and they really don't have </v>

250
00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:33.961
<v Speaker 3>the ability to hide it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

251
00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:38.020
<v Speaker 3>We had a case recently in the UK where </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who was a great heritage of the</v>

252
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:43.021
<v Speaker 3>left full sorts of complicated reasons </v>
<v Speaker 3>was accused of some fairly.</v>

253
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm very serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>groping accusations about how this and </v>

254
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.990
<v Speaker 3>exactly the left wing MPs who had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>claiming that somebody who had sent out </v>

255
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:57.340
<v Speaker 3>a tweet about a woman's breasts in 2009 </v>
<v Speaker 3>should never hold any role in public,</v>

256
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.020
<v Speaker 3>said that this person who just happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a friend and an icon of theirs was</v>

257
00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:04.690
<v Speaker 3>a changed man and we have to recognize </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

258
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Eighteen months ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my favorite video on this was a.</v>

259
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:13.900
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy who is a some rigid </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious Christian man on television </v>

260
00:14:14.681 --> 00:14:19.681
<v Speaker 3>and he was talking about trump and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was talking about who trump was before </v>

261
00:14:19.681 --> 00:14:22.030
<v Speaker 3>he became president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

262
00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:27.031
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know about you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've found Jesus and I did not have </v>

263
00:14:27.031 --> 00:14:30.270
<v Speaker 3>a past put praise Jesus and he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and everyone's cheering.</v>

264
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:35.490
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever he was before he found Jesus </v>

265
00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.150
<v Speaker 3>side as if trump got into office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

266
00:14:37.151 --> 00:14:38.860
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a new man.</v>

267
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:44.090
<v Speaker 3>I found Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got the Jesus passed all that stuff </v>

268
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.440
<v Speaker 3>that I did the last 70 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

269
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.160
<v Speaker 3>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people do treat that as a </v>

270
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.100
<v Speaker 3>journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Malcolm muggeridge very distinguished </v>

271
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:53.100
<v Speaker 3>figure in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

272
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:53.100
<v Speaker 3>some years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

273
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.520
<v Speaker 1>who it was often noted that his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he converted to Catholicism and he,</v>

274
00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:00.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mutual friend once said that it was </v>

275
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.831
<v Speaker 1>noticeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malcolm muggeridge always attacked </v>

276
00:15:02.831 --> 00:15:05.771
<v Speaker 1>advice immediately after he had become </v>
<v Speaker 1>incapable of it himself when it was </v>

277
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:14.150
<v Speaker 1>clear the mortgage didn't have as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex as he did fairly often in his youth.</v>

278
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Sex was a big problem.</v>

279
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:19.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a giant problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He needs to let everybody know.</v>

280
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtue signaling to the highest degree.</v>

281
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Let everybody know this is awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that pleasure and flesh stop it.</v>

282
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.620
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of it,</v>

283
00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:32.690
<v Speaker 3>but I won't have it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not In my bedroom.</v>

284
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.200
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

285
00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:36.770
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

286
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm hopeful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hopeful that we're gonna work </v>

287
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:41.800
<v Speaker 3>through this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

288
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm also disturbed because no one's at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the wheel.</v>

289
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:49.390
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no particular logical human </v>

290
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.601
<v Speaker 3>being that's out at the wheel that has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>real rational sort of a solution for all</v>

291
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:55.610
<v Speaker 3>of these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just chaos.</v>

292
00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:56.620
<v Speaker 3>And in funding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the</v>

293
00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.390
<v Speaker 1>problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

294
00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:02.460
<v Speaker 1>it comes back to thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth being whatever you're having </v>

295
00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.441
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have any one that we might </v>

296
00:16:04.441 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 1>mutually agree on some kind of empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

297
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.430
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's becoming,</v>

298
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.550
<v Speaker 1>that's becoming part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>

299
00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:09.490
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who.</v>

300
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be very suspicious of any empire put</v>

301
00:16:12.491 --> 00:16:13.140
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

302
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.400
<v Speaker 1>but where would you roughly look for </v>
<v Speaker 1>one?</v>

303
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to think that truth is still </v>

304
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:20.770
<v Speaker 1>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

305
00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:25.771
<v Speaker 1>when you discover that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't seem to particularly care for it </v>

306
00:16:25.771 --> 00:16:27.490
<v Speaker 1>or willing to sacrifice it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I say for some other purpose,</v>

307
00:16:27.491 --> 00:16:30.280
<v Speaker 1>including winning a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

308
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.870
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to see how you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjudicate in this era,</v>

309
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:40.590
<v Speaker 1>but just one of the photos in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot of this has to do with </v>

310
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.180
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the online world can </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgive.</v>

311
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.640
<v Speaker 1>This seems to me to be a really central </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

312
00:16:45.641 --> 00:16:50.641
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that came up the case </v>

313
00:16:50.641 --> 00:16:53.671
<v Speaker 1>I said recently about this 2009 cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody in Britain who tweeted about a </v>

314
00:16:53.671 --> 00:16:57.781
<v Speaker 1>woman's breasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among other things was he mistook </v>

315
00:16:57.781 --> 00:16:59.770
<v Speaker 1>twitter for a conversation with friends.</v>

316
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.430
<v Speaker 1>And how did he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

317
00:17:04.431 --> 00:17:09.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in public office and a journalist </v>

318
00:17:09.431 --> 00:17:10.710
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was,</v>

319
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.930
<v Speaker 1>was going to get a public office anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is,</v>

320
00:17:13.931 --> 00:17:14.720
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

321
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:20.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know what the rules are </v>

322
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:21.571
<v Speaker 1>that are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like what if you were a bit of a </v>

323
00:17:21.571 --> 00:17:23.881
<v Speaker 1>Dick 10 years ago like that on a medium </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people were still finding their way</v>

324
00:17:24.371 --> 00:17:29.371
<v Speaker 1>on and now you are genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you moved on kids and,</v>

325
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.630
<v Speaker 1>and yet the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the breast tweet is always with you.</v>

326
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a sort of dystopian nightmare that </v>

327
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.140
<v Speaker 1>you'd always be stuck with your worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

328
00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:47.290
<v Speaker 1>You'd be stuck with your lowest sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis moment recently with Bill Maher,</v>

329
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Maher,</v>

330
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.210
<v Speaker 2>there was something that he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in 1989.</v>

331
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is insane.</v>

332
00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>29 years ago he wrote something and uh,</v>

333
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.110
<v Speaker 2>people used it recently against him in </v>
<v Speaker 2>29.</v>

334
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:07.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how old billy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think bill is even 60,</v>

335
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.990
<v Speaker 2>so we're talking about something that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote when he was in his twenties and he</v>

336
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.660
<v Speaker 2>was a struggling standup comedian.</v>

337
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:13.420
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

338
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.580
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

339
00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the is very good for this,</v>

340
00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:17.380
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can,</v>

341
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.110
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can dig up everyone.</v>

342
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is.</v>

343
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's screwed up from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:18:22.951 --> 00:18:25.600
<v Speaker 1>apart from yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a w.</v>

345
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:31.150
<v Speaker 1>We had somebody recently in Burton who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who ever wanted to go for suddenly and </v>

346
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:36.350
<v Speaker 1>they found an article he had written </v>
<v Speaker 1>about saying he didn't agree with </v>

347
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust denial laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

348
00:18:36.941 --> 00:18:37.470
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

349
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.990
<v Speaker 1>he said he just thought it was a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea for free speech,</v>

350
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

351
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:46.910
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Internet was a second story to </v>

352
00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:47.310
<v Speaker 1>find out other stuff about it and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>found an article which said,</v>

353
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Holocaust denier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

354
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosecute me sorta thing,</v>

355
00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:56.601
<v Speaker 1>which he isn't a Holocaust denier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just nobody bothered to read </v>

356
00:18:56.601 --> 00:18:59.040
<v Speaker 1>beneath the headline and say suddenly in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the thing,</v>

357
00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:04.041
<v Speaker 1>wherever I was telling about his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also said Andy's a Holocaust </v>

358
00:19:04.041 --> 00:19:04.041
<v Speaker 1>denier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was,</v>

359
00:19:04.041 --> 00:19:08.091
<v Speaker 1>that was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unlike something he wrote 15 years </v>

360
00:19:08.091 --> 00:19:08.610
<v Speaker 1>ago and it wasn't even an event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a headline or something.</v>

361
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

362
00:19:10.591 --> 00:19:11.490
<v Speaker 1>and everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

363
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.580
<v Speaker 1>nobody cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get onto the next victim.</v>

364
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's a Nazi.</v>

365
00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.620
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

366
00:19:20.621 --> 00:19:23.920
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously the case of living </v>
<v Speaker 2>glasshouses and throwing tons of rocks,</v>

367
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:29.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost like everyone is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to throw as many rocks as they </v>

368
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.840
<v Speaker 2>can before rock start coming their way </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they know it's inevitable.</v>

369
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I felt until February the </v>

370
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:41.600
<v Speaker 1>object of life in the modern era was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prove everyone else was a racist Nazi,</v>

371
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.070
<v Speaker 1>misogynistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transphobic.</v>

372
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.080
<v Speaker 1>And then you win is somehow coronation </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

373
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

374
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:51.060
<v Speaker 1>you're the person who's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now,</v>

375
00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:52.970
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems everyone is aware that it's,</v>

376
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.130
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a Mexican gunfight.</v>

377
00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend of mine who had been on </v>

378
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:03.260
<v Speaker 2>this podcast before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back when he was a radical lefties,</v>

379
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:08.270
<v Speaker 2>name's Jamie Kilstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's a stand up comedian and he was </v>

380
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.740
<v Speaker 2>a real radical social justice warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male feminists,</v>

381
00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:13.500
<v Speaker 2>lefty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they turned on him radical.</v>

382
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.110
<v Speaker 2>What did they do horribly at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

383
00:20:15.111 --> 00:20:17.000
<v Speaker 2>they found out he was trying to have sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>with girls.</v>

384
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:21.390
<v Speaker 2>That can be another one and it was all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just having sex.</v>

385
00:20:21.391 --> 00:20:21.910
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

386
00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:22.880
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

387
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.620
<v Speaker 2>he didn't rape anybody who didn't grow </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

388
00:20:24.621 --> 00:20:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

389
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:31.950
<v Speaker 2>he threw some passes and less passes are</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent successful?</v>

390
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

391
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:40.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same exact paths could be your </v>

392
00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:40.330
<v Speaker 2>future wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

393
00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.560
<v Speaker 2>And this one just felt 15 yards short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no room for error,</v>

394
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.490
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took long time off of social media in</v>

395
00:20:49.491 --> 00:20:51.310
<v Speaker 2>a long time off of performing and these.</v>

396
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:56.450
<v Speaker 2>He came on and was really brave about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he talked about who we used to be </v>

397
00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.090
<v Speaker 2>and he said he was in this frantic state</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he was just constantly attacking </v>

398
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:04.831
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just attacking people and then checking </v>

399
00:21:04.831 --> 00:21:06.871
<v Speaker 2>his twitter or see who responded to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack and where people are on his side,</v>

400
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:12.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are people agreeing with him as he </v>

401
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.030
<v Speaker 2>getting those social justice points that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wanted and he was really honest about</v>

402
00:21:13.031 --> 00:21:18.031
<v Speaker 2>the feeling that he got the Ang anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think a lot of people engage in </v>

403
00:21:18.031 --> 00:21:19.110
<v Speaker 2>on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of.</v>

404
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.950
<v Speaker 2>If you go to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's quite a few people that I follow</v>

405
00:21:21.951 --> 00:21:24.790
<v Speaker 2>that seem to just always be in conflict </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just go to watch.</v>

406
00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:27.670
<v Speaker 2>I'll just go to their page almost like </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching a fistfight in the backyard</v>

407
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.000
<v Speaker 2>and they're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there's this.</v>

408
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:36.090
<v Speaker 2>They're addicted to this constant seesaw</v>
<v Speaker 2>of emotions and this interaction.</v>

409
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:42.090
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It releases the necessarily chemical in </v>

410
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:42.090
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>

411
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:42.830
<v Speaker 1>they get upset when they step away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>it for a bit.</v>

412
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:48.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't engage in any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bit of it because I've seen </v>

413
00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.570
<v Speaker 1>suddenly a lot of the most mediocre </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds of my generation brought low by </v>

414
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:56.531
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are some people who I </v>

415
00:21:56.531 --> 00:21:58.720
<v Speaker 1>admired until I followed them on social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media and,</v>

416
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.300
<v Speaker 1>and now I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

417
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.500
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shouty angry person who's,</v>

418
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.990
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's like a drunk at closing time,</v>

419
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:11.350
<v Speaker 1>desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flailing around with your fists are </v>

420
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.570
<v Speaker 1>looking for somebody to fight with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

421
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.250
<v Speaker 1>and to what end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

422
00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.150
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another experience I had,</v>

423
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:22.180
<v Speaker 1>I've had in recent years that led me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not want to engage in this is walking </v>

424
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.220
<v Speaker 1>around in various events in sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakout things.</v>

425
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.890
<v Speaker 1>You people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

426
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:31.730
<v Speaker 1>really people I've admired in the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>all saying things like,</v>

427
00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.240
<v Speaker 1>you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see I flame decks on twitter.</v>

428
00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.370
<v Speaker 1>I do see what I tweeted about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

429
00:22:37.371 --> 00:22:42.371
<v Speaker 1>I think these used to be serious people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in these used to be serious.</v>

430
00:22:43.641 --> 00:22:48.641
<v Speaker 1>People engaged in serious things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>here they are engaged in these for </v>

431
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:54.420
<v Speaker 1>flailing fistfights and often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often let's face it on things.</v>

432
00:22:54.951 --> 00:22:59.951
<v Speaker 1>Which if you didn't do it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking out the fight or the sort of </v>

433
00:22:59.951 --> 00:23:01.520
<v Speaker 1>thing that would allow for normal human </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

434
00:23:01.521 --> 00:23:06.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many disagreements do we have with </v>

435
00:23:06.521 --> 00:23:06.521
<v Speaker 1>people in our personal lives all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>

436
00:23:06.521 --> 00:23:08.450
<v Speaker 1>If we wanted to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't vote this way,</v>

437
00:23:08.451 --> 00:23:13.451
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people would mind about </v>

438
00:23:13.451 --> 00:23:13.451
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

439
00:23:13.451 --> 00:23:13.451
<v Speaker 1>I know you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think slightly differently for me on</v>

440
00:23:13.451 --> 00:23:17.861
<v Speaker 1>this particular issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't say let's have that out now </v>

441
00:23:17.901 --> 00:23:20.360
<v Speaker 1>once and for all you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

442
00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:25.420
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find ways to live with people's </v>

443
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.510
<v Speaker 1>differences and different opinions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get everyone exactly</v>

444
00:23:26.511 --> 00:23:27.330
<v Speaker 1>in line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

445
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.440
<v Speaker 1>we all knew that before the age of </v>
<v Speaker 1>social media and now it seems to be the </v>

446
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.740
<v Speaker 1>only aim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that is?</v>

447
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's what we were discussing </v>

448
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.481
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's idea of sport and then you </v>

449
00:23:40.481 --> 00:23:42.161
<v Speaker 2>just get caught up in like someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>volleyed your way and so you have to </v>

450
00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:42.161
<v Speaker 2>smash that tennis ball back their way.</v>

451
00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:43.480
<v Speaker 1>It is something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

452
00:23:43.481 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say I haven't felt the vicarious</v>

453
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.620
<v Speaker 1>pleasure of some of that myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

454
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:52.160
<v Speaker 1>that old Chinese proverb about I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting by the river watching the bodies</v>

455
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:57.161
<v Speaker 1>of your enemies float by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a big sense of that the other day </v>

456
00:23:57.161 --> 00:24:01.781
<v Speaker 1>when somebody I deeply disliked came </v>
<v Speaker 1>across her on social media at the same </v>

457
00:24:02.001 --> 00:24:07.001
<v Speaker 1>time as somebody else I deeply disliked </v>
<v Speaker 1>was being held by the French police on </v>

458
00:24:07.001 --> 00:24:07.910
<v Speaker 1>serious charges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that was,</v>

459
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I felt like the Chinese proverb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all right.</v>

460
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.480
<v Speaker 1>And so I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see why people feel it.</v>

461
00:24:14.481 --> 00:24:19.481
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course people who they could </v>

462
00:24:19.481 --> 00:24:21.350
<v Speaker 1>never normally get to who they've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

463
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:22.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

464
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:23.470
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

465
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.900
<v Speaker 1>the big thing of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

466
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.140
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I poked that.</v>

467
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:32.410
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never engaged on social media for </v>

468
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:36.821
<v Speaker 1>precisely that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that reason among others that you would </v>

469
00:24:36.821 --> 00:24:37.870
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never want somebody to know that</v>

470
00:24:37.871 --> 00:24:38.750
<v Speaker 1>they could get to me.</v>

471
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Even if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you just block them,</v>

472
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.480
<v Speaker 1>there's many people who take pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in their heading.</v>

473
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.660
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am blocked on twitter by all these </v>

474
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.271
<v Speaker 1>people and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually I do sometimes read what </v>

475
00:24:52.271 --> 00:24:52.271
<v Speaker 1>people say is sending to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

476
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:57.300
<v Speaker 1>and I've never blocked anyone because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing you should mind that if </v>

477
00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:57.560
<v Speaker 1>you put your ideas out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well be as open as possible</v>

478
00:24:57.561 --> 00:25:00.890
<v Speaker 1>to receiving them back some time ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got into a car with the,</v>

479
00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.310
<v Speaker 1>with the Turkish president about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

480
00:25:04.311 --> 00:25:05.480
<v Speaker 1>about something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

481
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.050
<v Speaker 1>I got all these Turkish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

482
00:25:07.051 --> 00:25:08.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of accounts sending me stuff.</v>

483
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:12.050
<v Speaker 1>There's one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just repeatedly sent me a pornography</v>

484
00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:15.550
<v Speaker 1>of animals having sex with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't know it is,</v>

485
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.300
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very hardcore.</v>

486
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.440
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I used to go down the feet.</v>

487
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Now that gun I didn't even block in </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually because I sort of thought,</v>

488
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:25.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in Turkey,</v>

489
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:31.200
<v Speaker 1>he's a really angry man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperately finding horse pornography </v>

490
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.480
<v Speaker 1>send to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a way I felt so sorry for him </v>

491
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.310
<v Speaker 1>that that was how his life had come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the end.</v>

492
00:25:37.311 --> 00:25:38.870
<v Speaker 1>His life had come to at this stage that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

493
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.330
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even block him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also he'd be like,</v>

494
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm the donkey porn guy who got blocked </v>
<v Speaker 1>by dark.</v>

495
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:50.250
<v Speaker 1>He'd get a certain thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was his motivation for sending you </v>

496
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:50.750
<v Speaker 1>this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

497
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

498
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.580
<v Speaker 1>it was because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

499
00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:59.620
<v Speaker 1>the short story is a couple of years ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Turkey's president tried to get</v>

500
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:04.691
<v Speaker 1>the German chancellor to imprison a </v>
<v Speaker 1>German comic for a very rude poem he'd </v>

501
00:26:06.111 --> 00:26:11.111
<v Speaker 1>read on air on German television that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was insulting about the Turkish </v>

502
00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:14.711
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the German authorities actually </v>

503
00:26:14.711 --> 00:26:17.621
<v Speaker 1>started a case against the comedian for </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulting the Turkish president,</v>

504
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Edwin.</v>

505
00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.460
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

506
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to launch a,</v>

507
00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.070
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

508
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.730
<v Speaker 1>an offensive poetry competition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>offend the Turkish president.</v>

509
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.840
<v Speaker 1>And there was a thousand pounds cash </v>
<v Speaker 1>prize and it sort of took off.</v>

510
00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:37.841
<v Speaker 1>And in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the now foreign secretary entered in </v>

511
00:26:37.841 --> 00:26:38.320
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

512
00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:39.590
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

513
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.800
<v Speaker 1>it was really good because at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time that the Germans were looking at </v>

514
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.980
<v Speaker 1>imprisoning a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

515
00:26:46.981 --> 00:26:48.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the now foreign secretary,</v>

516
00:26:48.721 --> 00:26:52.050
<v Speaker 1>the UK was guilty of precisely the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>alleged crime.</v>

517
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I eman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a crime,</v>

518
00:26:53.531 --> 00:26:55.860
<v Speaker 1>it couldn't be a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple other people did.</v>

519
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful Dutch comedian friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hans Johnson,</v>

520
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 1>or sort of a similar thing that time he </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to do an interview live on Dutch</v>

521
00:27:02.611 --> 00:27:05.760
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining how much he hated him because</v>

522
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:07.560
<v Speaker 1>he still owed him money from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blowjob.</v>

523
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:12.650
<v Speaker 1>He'd given Edwin in a sauna and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch authorities were looking at.</v>

524
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Actually we're looking at.</v>

525
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.680
<v Speaker 1>They were asked if they would prosecute </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

526
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.780
<v Speaker 1>but anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this was,</v>

527
00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:23.820
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a great time with this of course,</v>

528
00:27:23.821 --> 00:27:27.060
<v Speaker 1>and I wrote a limerick explaining how </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm abusive.</v>

529
00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:32.061
<v Speaker 1>I wanted people to be about Edwin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it wasn't necessary to be highly </v>

530
00:27:32.061 --> 00:27:35.421
<v Speaker 1>defamatory and you wouldn't get away </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it if you just called him a banker </v>

531
00:27:35.421 --> 00:27:39.000
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote the opening verse and invited</v>

532
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:42.060
<v Speaker 1>the world to contribute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they did and it became,</v>

533
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:47.061
<v Speaker 1>among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest paid poetry competition in </v>

534
00:27:47.061 --> 00:27:47.061
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

535
00:27:47.061 --> 00:27:47.061
<v Speaker 1>if like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read a Limerick,</v>

536
00:27:47.061 --> 00:27:48.680
<v Speaker 1>just five lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 pounds a light.</v>

537
00:27:48.681 --> 00:27:49.290
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

538
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.900
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A poetry,</v>

539
00:27:50.901 --> 00:27:54.030
<v Speaker 1>a magazine could pave for such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

540
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.250
<v Speaker 1>such such work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyhow,</v>

541
00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.080
<v Speaker 1>on the basis of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became very,</v>

542
00:27:58.081 --> 00:28:01.050
<v Speaker 1>very unpopular in Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were many,</v>

543
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:05.550
<v Speaker 1>many pieces talking about how this gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist,</v>

544
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.720
<v Speaker 1>terrible Edwin Hater in Britain was </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what we're up against.</v>

545
00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:11.160
<v Speaker 1>So him and his poems.</v>

546
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

547
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the German government was actually </v>

548
00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:20.400
<v Speaker 1>considering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

549
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Prosecuting this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far did they take it?</v>

550
00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was taken in for questioning.</v>

551
00:28:25.201 --> 00:28:30.201
<v Speaker 1>I know he had to retain lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fairly sure they did only drop it in</v>

552
00:28:30.601 --> 00:28:33.480
<v Speaker 1>the end because of the international </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention that was paid to it.</v>

553
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.120
<v Speaker 1>There was this easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this law on the books.</v>

554
00:28:36.121 --> 00:28:41.121
<v Speaker 1>It's still set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was less imagine stay Lord about </v>

555
00:28:41.121 --> 00:28:41.910
<v Speaker 1>defending foreign rulers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had,</v>

556
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.340
<v Speaker 1>he had done it for such an important </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason as well,</v>

557
00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:46.050
<v Speaker 1>which was to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

558
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.180
<v Speaker 1>we in Germany should have the right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be rude about Edward,</v>

559
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:50.990
<v Speaker 1>particularly Edwin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you know,</v>

560
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:55.680
<v Speaker 1>was promoted for Matt to Prime Minister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the president wants to be so tired,</v>

561
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

562
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:59.490
<v Speaker 1>it is a very bad man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Locked up more journalists per capita,</v>

563
00:28:59.491 --> 00:29:04.491
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than any other country in the world </v>

564
00:29:04.491 --> 00:29:04.491
<v Speaker 1>other than China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't think we can get the stats</v>

565
00:29:04.491 --> 00:29:07.620
<v Speaker 1>on a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very evil.</v>

566
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I think man who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has led his country backwards in the</v>

567
00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:17.091
<v Speaker 1>last 20 years and this is in the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trying to destroy a wonderful country</v>

568
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.580
<v Speaker 1>and if you can't be rude about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't pretend that he sleeps with</v>

569
00:29:22.921 --> 00:29:24.130
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

570
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.360
<v Speaker 1>which is what the German comedian </v>
<v Speaker 1>started with,</v>

571
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.840
<v Speaker 1>then somewhere down the line you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to say anything about the </v>

572
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:32.960
<v Speaker 1>imprisoned journalists either and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

573
00:29:32.961 --> 00:29:34.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since also by the way,</v>

574
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:40.040
<v Speaker 1>people don't seem to spend my time </v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying about the Turkish journalist </v>

575
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Edwin in prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the least.</v>

576
00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:43.390
<v Speaker 1>They paid attention when I said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

577
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:48.750
<v Speaker 1>he and Angela Merkel got up to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>filthy filthy acts in the zoo.</v>

578
00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously the worst case of retaliation </v>

579
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.560
<v Speaker 2>for humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably Charlie Updo,</v>

580
00:29:57.561 --> 00:29:58.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

581
00:29:58.881 --> 00:30:03.881
<v Speaker 2>which is a terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately many people weren't </v>

582
00:30:05.061 --> 00:30:09.620
<v Speaker 2>defending the murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking the murderers.</v>

583
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think how many.</v>

584
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.960
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 11 people were murdered </v>
<v Speaker 2>and ended up placing a police officer,</v>

585
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

586
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.980
<v Speaker 2>but they were saying that instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on the murder,</v>

587
00:30:21.981 --> 00:30:26.981
<v Speaker 2>which was done completely out of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforcing their rules of their </v>

588
00:30:27.621 --> 00:30:32.621
<v Speaker 2>ideology and in retaliation for any </v>
<v Speaker 2>mocking of that ideology,</v>

589
00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:38.020
<v Speaker 2>instead of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were talking about how racist </v>

590
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Hebdo was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of that.</v>

591
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:42.730
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Jamie Kilstein was a part of </v>

592
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:44.531
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on television back in his super </v>

593
00:30:44.531 --> 00:30:48.431
<v Speaker 2>social justice warrior days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talking about that you wish you might </v>

594
00:30:48.431 --> 00:30:48.470
<v Speaker 2>have other things that people said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

595
00:30:48.471 --> 00:30:50.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about something if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know about it.</v>

596
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:51.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

597
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:56.910
<v Speaker 1>In my guess was that until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until the murders,</v>

598
00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:01.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean an infinitely small number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people knew about Shaadi Abdo outside of</v>

599
00:31:01.191 --> 00:31:06.191
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found myself in the wake of that in </v>

600
00:31:06.191 --> 00:31:08.840
<v Speaker 1>studios with people who I know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just googled Charlene's up there the day</v>

601
00:31:08.841 --> 00:31:13.841
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that they just gone to wikipedia </v>

602
00:31:13.841 --> 00:31:16.781
<v Speaker 1>and read an English version of a claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what that magazine was about.</v>

603
00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Goes back to my point about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist in the Holocaust denial thing</v>

604
00:31:20.931 --> 00:31:24.110
<v Speaker 1>that you just root around a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people being killed.</v>

605
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.980
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't seem to vindicate my sides </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>

606
00:31:27.981 --> 00:31:30.650
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me find what I can do to defame them</v>

607
00:31:30.651 --> 00:31:31.250
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>

608
00:31:31.251 --> 00:31:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlene Abdo once did this cartoon that</v>

609
00:31:34.311 --> 00:31:38.630
<v Speaker 1>was off color and I can't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the words are beneath it,</v>

610
00:31:38.631 --> 00:31:40.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll claim it's racist to me.</v>

611
00:31:40.141 --> 00:31:42.260
<v Speaker 1>People were actually doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually,</v>

612
00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.460
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

613
00:31:43.461 --> 00:31:48.461
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one cartoon that was used </v>

614
00:31:48.461 --> 00:31:48.461
<v Speaker 1>against Charlie Hebdo after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>massacre.</v>

615
00:31:48.461 --> 00:31:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a joke against the front </v>

616
00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.571
<v Speaker 1>nasional and the claims they were making</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the black woman in Sarcozi </v>

617
00:31:56.690 --> 00:32:00.060
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because the joke and the rich,</v>

618
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.960
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't speak French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't clear.</v>

619
00:32:02.961 --> 00:32:04.870
<v Speaker 1>It apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it.</v>

620
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:06.760
<v Speaker 1>And if you knew nothing about recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>French history,</v>

621
00:32:06.761 --> 00:32:09.120
<v Speaker 1>you knew nothing about the social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sarcozi administration and,</v>

622
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.550
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ministry in question.</v>

623
00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:15.080
<v Speaker 1>These people just went to it and said </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist cartoon.</v>

624
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Not Noticing that the cartoon was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a joke about racists,</v>

625
00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.250
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't bother to find that out.</v>

626
00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.550
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that I thought that whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing among many,</v>

627
00:32:25.551 --> 00:32:29.870
<v Speaker 1>many other things was deeply worrying </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that point of view because it means</v>

628
00:32:29.871 --> 00:32:34.610
<v Speaker 1>that in the immediate aftermath of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that should be so damn clear,</v>

629
00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.060
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people can just try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reframe the narrative.</v>

630
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really change the history of a </v>

631
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.660
<v Speaker 1>publication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

632
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim it is just something different.</v>

633
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:50.840
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for a lot of people,</v>

634
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:52.440
<v Speaker 1>of course that was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

635
00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.920
<v Speaker 1>that was very convenient because after </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

636
00:32:54.921 --> 00:32:57.710
<v Speaker 1>if Charlie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his staff actually were these racists,</v>

637
00:32:57.711 --> 00:33:02.711
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't need to worry too much about </v>

638
00:33:02.711 --> 00:33:04.500
<v Speaker 1>them or why you'd been silent on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues they've spoken up about.</v>

639
00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The narrative then been that these </v>

640
00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.861
<v Speaker 2>people had been mocking this </v>
<v Speaker 2>disenfranchised marginalized group in </v>

641
00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.660
<v Speaker 2>society and that they had it coming in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some very strange way.</v>

642
00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.780
<v Speaker 2>And it's part of me struggled with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was like,</v>

643
00:33:21.781 --> 00:33:26.781
<v Speaker 2>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people just have contrarion </v>

644
00:33:26.781 --> 00:33:26.781
<v Speaker 2>instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's going left.</v>

645
00:33:26.781 --> 00:33:27.510
<v Speaker 2>They just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

646
00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:32.660
<v Speaker 2>And they want to go the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many people that have that </v>

647
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:32.660
<v Speaker 2>instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's,</v>

648
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.160
<v Speaker 2>as you said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this headline mentality,</v>

649
00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:37.740
<v Speaker 2>they read the headline and don't look </v>
<v Speaker 2>any further into it.</v>

650
00:33:37.741 --> 00:33:39.810
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's a headline about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>headline,</v>

651
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:42.390
<v Speaker 2>it's theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all they need.</v>

652
00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:47.420
<v Speaker 2>They're armed with enough facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They slam their laptop down and start </v>

653
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:47.420
<v Speaker 2>debating.</v>

654
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that case,</v>

655
00:33:49.511 --> 00:33:54.511
<v Speaker 1>as in many others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally lose sight of the only thing </v>

656
00:33:54.511 --> 00:33:56.050
<v Speaker 1>that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that matters in that case</v>

657
00:33:56.051 --> 00:34:01.051
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it ever right to make apologies for </v>

658
00:34:01.991 --> 00:34:06.610
<v Speaker 1>people walking into an office and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gunning down people for an opinion.</v>

659
00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:09.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't like the honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has to be,</v>

660
00:34:09.731 --> 00:34:11.620
<v Speaker 1>of course no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has to be,</v>

661
00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.370
<v Speaker 1>has to be now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet in these moments.</v>

662
00:34:15.371 --> 00:34:17.780
<v Speaker 1>So we had 1:20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years before with the rush,</v>

663
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.300
<v Speaker 1>dfs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the satanic verses.</v>

664
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:24.310
<v Speaker 1>If in these moments you discover that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the allies on your side,</v>

665
00:34:24.911 --> 00:34:27.910
<v Speaker 1>you thought you did in the wake of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rush,</v>

666
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:32.950
<v Speaker 1>tfl and 89,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was people from the right and the </v>

667
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:35.500
<v Speaker 1>left in Britain who started making </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuses for the ayatollah in,</v>

668
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

669
00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:37.640
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

670
00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:42.660
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chief rabbi of the UK Djokovics to </v>

671
00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:42.660
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to his shame,</v>

672
00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:47.641
<v Speaker 1>said both Mr Rusty and vio taller has </v>
<v Speaker 1>offended people's feelings as if someone</v>

673
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:49.790
<v Speaker 1>had in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

674
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called on all novelists to go to Tehran,</v>

675
00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:55.330
<v Speaker 1>assassinate the ayatollah if they had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>

676
00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:57.990
<v Speaker 1>You had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

677
00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.750
<v Speaker 1>somebody like a right wing conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>minister,</v>

678
00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:07.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffery Howe who said that said that </v>

679
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:07.180
<v Speaker 1>overall she had done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had really offended Britain.</v>

680
00:35:07.181 --> 00:35:10.780
<v Speaker 1>He'd been rude about Britain as if that </v>
<v Speaker 1>had anything to do with anything.</v>

681
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was uh,</v>

682
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.230
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

683
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:19.470
<v Speaker 1>there was one famous case of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a conservative peer who said about </v>

684
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Rushdie that he wouldn't bother him if a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of young Muslims took Mr Roche </v>

685
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.620
<v Speaker 1>into an alleyway and taught him some </v>
<v Speaker 1>manners.</v>

686
00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.210
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you had that from the left as well.</v>

687
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>granted,</v>

688
00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Labour MP famously said at that point </v>
<v Speaker 1>the burning books wasn't a problem for </v>

689
00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:37.570
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

690
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:42.890
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was when they were burning the </v>

691
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.890
<v Speaker 1>satanic verses in Bradford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

692
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:46.560
<v Speaker 1>so you get these weird coalitions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who suddenly turned out not to </v>

693
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:46.860
<v Speaker 1>get the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to get the point,</v>

694
00:35:46.861 --> 00:35:51.861
<v Speaker 1>not want to defend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course you get the cowards </v>

695
00:35:51.861 --> 00:35:51.861
<v Speaker 1>to say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

696
00:35:51.861 --> 00:35:51.861
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't my sort of novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

697
00:35:51.861 --> 00:35:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think novel was all that good.</v>

698
00:35:53.221 --> 00:35:58.221
<v Speaker 1>I midnight's children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could cope with static versus he lost </v>

699
00:35:58.221 --> 00:36:01.341
<v Speaker 1>me with a plot as if that means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can call for the death of the </v>

700
00:36:01.341 --> 00:36:02.430
<v Speaker 1>author rather than just give it a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>review.</v>

701
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.580
<v Speaker 2>How is he now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salman Rushdie still in hiding.</v>

702
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.090
<v Speaker 2>I know he does a lot of interviews now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it seems to be more relaxed.</v>

703
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems to be,</v>

704
00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the specifics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

705
00:36:13.141 --> 00:36:15.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an assurance,</v>

706
00:36:15.811 --> 00:36:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I think given some years ago in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>labor year Labor government,</v>

707
00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:22.770
<v Speaker 1>the width Tehran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would not actively,</v>

708
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

709
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage the murder of rushed anymore.</v>

710
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how nice.</v>

711
00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Nice icer them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a freezing and unfreezing </v>

712
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.130
<v Speaker 1>relations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

713
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point I wanted to make was it,</v>

714
00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.590
<v Speaker 1>that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've all,</v>

715
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:44.630
<v Speaker 1>we've been through these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know how it plays out with the </v>

716
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Hebdo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

717
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.290
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the murder of the staff and contributors</v>

718
00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:54.291
<v Speaker 1>to that magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We knew in the immediate aftermath what </v>

719
00:36:54.291 --> 00:36:58.461
<v Speaker 1>was going on and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there were people who just wanted </v>

720
00:36:58.461 --> 00:37:00.660
<v Speaker 1>to make excuses and you still hear that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

721
00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

722
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it on every single free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech debate in my adult life.</v>

723
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember growing up and I remember in </v>

724
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.921
<v Speaker 1>every one of the things in recent years </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Danish cartoons to the Julia </v>

725
00:37:15.921 --> 00:37:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Medina scandal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a publisher London's firebombed for </v>

726
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:21.300
<v Speaker 1>publishing a novel.</v>

727
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.480
<v Speaker 1>It was actually amazingly phoning about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed,</v>

728
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:27.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to charlene abdomen since you,</v>

729
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:32.300
<v Speaker 1>you just get these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this strange group of people from </v>

730
00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.571
<v Speaker 1>brightened left some believers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonbelievers who always just come up </v>

731
00:37:35.571 --> 00:37:39.660
<v Speaker 1>with these bullshit bullshit arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say things like,</v>

732
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:42.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't find the cartoon very funny.</v>

733
00:37:42.091 --> 00:37:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I never,</v>

734
00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:46.200
<v Speaker 1>I never took that magazine seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>

735
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it was right when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>did this and it just,</v>

736
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:54.950
<v Speaker 1>they just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason have the fortitude to </v>

737
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:55.650
<v Speaker 1>just say the only thing that matters in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wake of that,</v>

738
00:37:55.651 --> 00:37:56.580
<v Speaker 1>which is no.</v>

739
00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's because Islam is </v>
<v Speaker 2>unique in their approach to anything </v>

740
00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.670
<v Speaker 2>that goes outside the lines of what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel is.</v>

741
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely acceptable in terms of like </v>

742
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:12.990
<v Speaker 2>they will murder you if you draw </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muhammad.</v>

743
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

744
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.460
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

745
00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.670
<v Speaker 1>this is what's been described as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internalization of the fat.</v>

746
00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

747
00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:19.750
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

748
00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've had this experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually worse now,</v>

749
00:38:23.181 --> 00:38:25.640
<v Speaker 1>the presumption is worse than the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

750
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I have quite often people say to me now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to write this piece about Hex,</v>

751
00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:32.840
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if I can because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

752
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:37.360
<v Speaker 1>it might get a death sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually I always say,</v>

753
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.070
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

754
00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:44.120
<v Speaker 1>It fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far I haven't given that advice in </v>

755
00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.580
<v Speaker 1>the person's him being in any way under </v>
<v Speaker 1>any actual danger lambien killed.</v>

756
00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

757
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.400
<v Speaker 1>and I think I might feel differently if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the case.</v>

758
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

759
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:54.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

760
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:59.550
<v Speaker 1>but there is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an overcompensation occurring at the </v>

761
00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:02.200
<v Speaker 1>moment and it goes far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far within the,</v>

762
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:06.520
<v Speaker 1>within the boundaries of what actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>could plausibly get you into any trouble</v>

763
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.890
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the trouble is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

764
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.270
<v Speaker 1>legitimate to get into or not.</v>

765
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that now,</v>

766
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had many journalists in recent </v>

767
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.280
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly since shiny objects will </v>

768
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:20.280
<v Speaker 1>sidle up to me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

769
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I'd quite like to do this for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

770
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't dare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

771
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:25.870
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm talking about for like very </v>

772
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:26.110
<v Speaker 1>basic reporting and things that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not people saying,</v>

773
00:39:26.111 --> 00:39:28.330
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided to draw a great big cartoon of</v>

774
00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed with a great big dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

775
00:39:30.941 --> 00:39:32.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

776
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.100
<v Speaker 1>having sex with the pope or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

777
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never that.</v>

778
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:42.130
<v Speaker 1>It's never people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really just so keen to draw Mohammed</v>

779
00:39:42.131 --> 00:39:42.820
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas,</v>

780
00:39:42.821 --> 00:39:44.740
<v Speaker 1>what did I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never is that.</v>

781
00:39:44.741 --> 00:39:46.210
<v Speaker 1>It's always something way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

782
00:39:46.211 --> 00:39:51.211
<v Speaker 1>way down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of even like saying </v>

783
00:39:51.211 --> 00:39:53.860
<v Speaker 1>something critical if sense and regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

784
00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.290
<v Speaker 1>so the internalization of the fat ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>since 1989,</v>

785
00:39:56.291 --> 00:39:58.530
<v Speaker 1>which has been exacerbated now by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>killings,</v>

786
00:39:58.531 --> 00:40:02.350
<v Speaker 1>the Charlie Hebdo and as well the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks on the unit as Boston in Denmark</v>

787
00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:07.380
<v Speaker 1>means that we are in this period where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are really hyper </v>

788
00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:11.130
<v Speaker 1>hypersensitive and they really shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be because it really isn't that bad.</v>

789
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not as bad as they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is,</v>

790
00:40:14.561 --> 00:40:17.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do so much work if you,</v>

791
00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:22.630
<v Speaker 1>if you say to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got Kalashnikovs on my side,</v>

792
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean the extent and people in free </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>

793
00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I got really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really loathe to admit this,</v>

794
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's the classic is a classic sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a mob trek,</v>

795
00:40:33.911 --> 00:40:35.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocking on someone's door.</v>

796
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm very disappointed in you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my friend,</v>

797
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.580
<v Speaker 1>my huge friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

798
00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:47.850
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a really angry and I'm just holding </v>

799
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:50.941
<v Speaker 1>him back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do an amazing amount of work if </v>

800
00:40:50.941 --> 00:40:54.181
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to pull that trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can persuade people and it's </v>

801
00:40:54.521 --> 00:40:57.040
<v Speaker 1>actually the case that there are people </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're holding back,</v>

802
00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:00.790
<v Speaker 1>that you can make enormous inroads like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

803
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

804
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:05.950
<v Speaker 3>especially when there's actual evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people have been murdered and </v>

805
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.950
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

806
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:10.210
<v Speaker 3>One of the more fascinating things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlie Hebdo to me was the refusal of </v>

807
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:12.860
<v Speaker 3>any of the mainstream media to show any </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the cartoons.</v>

808
00:41:12.861 --> 00:41:17.861
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to go online and I felt like </v>

809
00:41:17.861 --> 00:41:17.900
<v Speaker 3>this was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They gave up the reins of information to</v>

810
00:41:17.901 --> 00:41:22.901
<v Speaker 3>the Internet when it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a real transitionary moment in our </v>

811
00:41:22.901 --> 00:41:23.090
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

812
00:41:23.091 --> 00:41:24.500
<v Speaker 3>Everyone went online to see what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

813
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.380
<v Speaker 3>the only place to go pump from your </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents,</v>

814
00:41:27.381 --> 00:41:32.381
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were still under the impression </v>

815
00:41:32.381 --> 00:41:34.541
<v Speaker 3>that these must be incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>pornographic cartoons that were really </v>

816
00:41:34.541 --> 00:41:34.541
<v Speaker 3>viciously attacking</v>

817
00:41:34.541 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

818
00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:40.640
<v Speaker 1>most anyone young can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could find this out for themselves.</v>

819
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:41.670
<v Speaker 1>And you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

820
00:41:41.671 --> 00:41:43.070
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave up the,</v>

821
00:41:43.071 --> 00:41:44.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the space to the net and they all,</v>

822
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.250
<v Speaker 1>they all had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

823
00:41:46.251 --> 00:41:49.400
<v Speaker 1>these sort of rubbishy I arguments that </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own about it.</v>

824
00:41:49.401 --> 00:41:51.540
<v Speaker 1>I tried in Britain to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

825
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:56.560
<v Speaker 1>get the press to do it at one go and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days after the massacre and,</v>

826
00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:01.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got pretty close,</v>

827
00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if everyone's there.</v>

828
00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:07.700
<v Speaker 1>So I am spartacus tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If everyone did it at once,</v>

829
00:42:07.701 --> 00:42:12.701
<v Speaker 1>then it'll be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would make it easier and the </v>

830
00:42:12.701 --> 00:42:14.840
<v Speaker 1>argument you always get about that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is a very persuasive argument,</v>

831
00:42:14.841 --> 00:42:19.841
<v Speaker 1>is that the editor of the magazine or </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper might get protection.</v>

832
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

833
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:27.440
<v Speaker 1>a girl from the typing pool sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and the,</v>

834
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.170
<v Speaker 1>which is what happened actually in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the satanic verses,</v>

835
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:35.200
<v Speaker 1>killings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stabbings and things like the Norwegian </v>

836
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:35.200
<v Speaker 1>translate with Japanese translator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

837
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.980
<v Speaker 1>it's people who under no security </v>
<v Speaker 1>protocol could possibly end up or </v>

838
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.040
<v Speaker 1>getting protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

839
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:46.210
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on the basis of fearing that the </v>

840
00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:46.820
<v Speaker 1>boss who almost always says no,</v>

841
00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:52.490
<v Speaker 3>one of the more uniquely American </v>
<v Speaker 3>responses to the Charlie Hebdo attack </v>

842
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.510
<v Speaker 3>was they had a drama Mohammed contest in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>

843
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:55.890
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I followed that.</v>

844
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was fascinating.</v>

845
00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:02.330
<v Speaker 3>And some guy showed up and started </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting at the building and they were </v>

846
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.750
<v Speaker 3>killed almost immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

847
00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:08.780
<v Speaker 3>Which is because they're in Texas and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just not the place to fuck </v>

848
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:08.780
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

849
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

850
00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:12.990
<v Speaker 1>it's worth mentioning with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

851
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the editor at Charlie Hebdo had police </v>

852
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:18.000
<v Speaker 1>protection in Paris and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

853
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I suppose they were not worth dwelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>or better than the,</v>

854
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:20.870
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

855
00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:22.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

856
00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:27.210
<v Speaker 1>the battle trained people who were sent </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Yemen to carry out that operation.</v>

857
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:31.940
<v Speaker 1>We just were better prepared than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French authorities realized.</v>

858
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

859
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:39.030
<v Speaker 3>very few people are really ready to </v>
<v Speaker 3>militarize cartoonist offices.</v>

860
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:42.460
<v Speaker 3>And that's really almost what you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to do.</v>

861
00:43:42.461 --> 00:43:45.940
<v Speaker 3>You would have to have navy seals of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bulletproof vests.</v>

862
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.350
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then packed and loaded.</v>

863
00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:48.540
<v Speaker 1>And then let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

864
00:43:48.541 --> 00:43:50.640
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you do start to question,</v>

865
00:43:50.641 --> 00:43:50.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

866
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this cartoon that funny?</v>

867
00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:54.430
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

868
00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:56.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's what they actually have done </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

869
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:57.150
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>

870
00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.130
<v Speaker 1>they did a little while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

871
00:43:59.131 --> 00:44:01.590
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not gonna keep doing this.</v>

872
00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't they have</v>

873
00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Mohammed making out with someone like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost</v>

874
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.450
<v Speaker 1>immediately after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

875
00:44:06.451 --> 00:44:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after about a year or so,</v>

876
00:44:09.181 --> 00:44:09.670
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

877
00:44:09.671 --> 00:44:14.671
<v Speaker 1>they stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said they didn't want to do </v>

878
00:44:14.671 --> 00:44:14.671
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

879
00:44:14.671 --> 00:44:14.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

880
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:16.290
<v Speaker 1>and you can't blame them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

881
00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.780
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that a,</v>

882
00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you have this experience in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of time.</v>

883
00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always get people on the,</v>

884
00:44:24.601 --> 00:44:29.601
<v Speaker 1>apart from the Turkish donkey porn guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people on twitter send me things </v>

885
00:44:29.601 --> 00:44:29.601
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

886
00:44:29.601 --> 00:44:34.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you draw Mohammed sort of </v>

887
00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:34.220
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

888
00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:34.430
<v Speaker 1>And first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

889
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a cartoonist,</v>

890
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:41.060
<v Speaker 1>but secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way in which this is always </v>

891
00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:41.760
<v Speaker 1>presented is amazing because it's always</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

892
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Like Xena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Warrior,</v>

893
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Princess Twelve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>93,</v>

894
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.620
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the guts to draw Mohammed</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary and you know,</v>

895
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:53.690
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you don't even know the guts of </v>

896
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:53.690
<v Speaker 1>your own name on twitter mate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

897
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:53.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

898
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.660
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

899
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:57.280
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of egging along.</v>

900
00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.740
<v Speaker 1>What happens in those cases?</v>

901
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:04.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to draw Mohammed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to Piss people off by </v>

902
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:07.761
<v Speaker 2>drawing the cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I do want to point out is that </v>

903
00:45:07.761 --> 00:45:07.761
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

904
00:45:07.761 --> 00:45:11.210
<v Speaker 2>if you don't defend people's rights to </v>
<v Speaker 2>draw things without getting murdered.</v>

905
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're living in an insane society.</v>

906
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

907
00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:16.560
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

908
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:19.360
<v Speaker 1>there's another thing we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know what comes next.</v>

909
00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point about this has always been </v>

910
00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:24.670
<v Speaker 1>think of something smaller than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cartoon to do,</v>

911
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

912
00:45:26.321 --> 00:45:31.321
<v Speaker 1>I still reserve the right to be amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call something a cartoon crisis and </v>

913
00:45:31.321 --> 00:45:33.220
<v Speaker 1>keep a straight face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

914
00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.750
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to militarize in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Garland,</v>

915
00:45:34.751 --> 00:45:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Texas because there's a cartoon crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well known</v>

916
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.820
<v Speaker 2>natural progression could easily be </v>
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>

917
00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:45.850
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to draw the cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then from there you're not allowed to </v>

918
00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:50.351
<v Speaker 2>speak of drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then from there you have to show </v>

919
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:55.750
<v Speaker 2>that you have a very certain idea in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your head of what is good and one is </v>

920
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:59.261
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to show that by verbalizing </v>

921
00:45:59.261 --> 00:46:01.301
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're forced to forced to verbalize </v>

922
00:46:01.301 --> 00:46:01.301
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

923
00:46:01.301 --> 00:46:03.030
<v Speaker 1>And let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if it's just the cartoon.</v>

924
00:46:03.031 --> 00:46:04.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

925
00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's short,</v>

926
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.060
<v Speaker 1>so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandy phone.</v>

927
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of my big beefs about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is that a,</v>

928
00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to not say what I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>true and even if that does offend,</v>

929
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:21.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point three or 4 billion people,</v>

930
00:46:21.161 --> 00:46:24.610
<v Speaker 1>it is often said and tones that are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely unthreatening.</v>

931
00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

932
00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:27.510
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

933
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Hebdo or somebody else can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>draw a cartoon of Muhammad and then I </v>

934
00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:33.970
<v Speaker 1>know that exactly in tandem with that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody saying,</v>

935
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:35.800
<v Speaker 1>and you douglas or you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

936
00:46:35.801 --> 00:46:39.310
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else can say what you find in the</v>

937
00:46:39.311 --> 00:46:44.210
<v Speaker 1>texts or what you think about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion and you can join the rest of,</v>

938
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:49.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the society and being brave and going</v>

939
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.480
<v Speaker 1>to the book of Mormon on a Friday night </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a laugh is a laugh.</v>

940
00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.960
<v Speaker 1>But don't you dare think of applying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam the same kind of speech you would </v>

941
00:46:59.411 --> 00:47:01.960
<v Speaker 1>apply to mormonism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

942
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:03.670
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I won't do,</v>

943
00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:05.890
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just weren't joining in on that.</v>

944
00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite there being a price to pay for </v>

945
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.380
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just wouldn't not say what I think</v>

946
00:47:14.381 --> 00:47:15.610
<v Speaker 1>is true in these matters.</v>

947
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Are you aware of what they did with </v>
<v Speaker 2>South Park?</v>

948
00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:23.830
<v Speaker 2>With South Park South Park?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got very crazy were they not only </v>

949
00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:28.691
<v Speaker 2>could not draw Muhammad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't draw Muhammad in a bear </v>

950
00:47:28.691 --> 00:47:33.191
<v Speaker 2>suit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then they have Mohammed in a bear </v>

951
00:47:33.191 --> 00:47:36.790
<v Speaker 2>suit in an armored car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you couldn't even see him,</v>

952
00:47:36.791 --> 00:47:41.791
<v Speaker 2>but it was implied that Muhammad was </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the armored car in a bear suit </v>

953
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:42.940
<v Speaker 2>and it's still.</v>

954
00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:44.540
<v Speaker 1>But they did my homies voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't they?</v>

955
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

956
00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 1>They gave him a screwy voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great Voice.</v>

957
00:47:49.001 --> 00:47:54.001
<v Speaker 1>So that was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you joke about the voice of </v>

958
00:47:54.001 --> 00:47:54.001
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you okay,</v>

959
00:47:54.001 --> 00:47:54.410
<v Speaker 1>but don't you dare show him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking insane.</v>

960
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:59.330
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird as well because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all make presumptions.</v>

961
00:47:59.331 --> 00:48:04.331
<v Speaker 1>It's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true that nobody ever drew </v>

962
00:48:04.331 --> 00:48:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

963
00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:09.880
<v Speaker 1>There are illustrations in books that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are still on sale of very old </v>

964
00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.540
<v Speaker 1>illustrations Mohammed through </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout Islamic history.</v>

965
00:48:11.541 --> 00:48:12.890
<v Speaker 1>That's before they knew better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

966
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but got a new note from Mohammed.</v>

967
00:48:16.371 --> 00:48:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

968
00:48:17.211 --> 00:48:21.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't like these fucking drawings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and not about killing people.</v>

969
00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:26.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't show my best side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

970
00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:28.850
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very strange position to be in</v>

971
00:48:28.851 --> 00:48:31.220
<v Speaker 1>because South Park ends up holding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

972
00:48:31.221 --> 00:48:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Then south park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like fat tire against South Bucket.</v>

973
00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:37.130
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that headline coming.</v>

974
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

975
00:48:38.841 --> 00:48:40.670
<v Speaker 1>everyone internalizes it and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks,</v>

976
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:41.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

977
00:48:41.301 --> 00:48:42.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

978
00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:45.920
<v Speaker 1>I admire them in the Mormon work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't follow them.</v>

979
00:48:45.921 --> 00:48:47.540
<v Speaker 1>And then Mohammed works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

980
00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:52.320
<v Speaker 1>and then the whole culture tilts it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

981
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:57.670
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's I think where we are at the </v>

982
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.670
<v Speaker 1>moment on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

983
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

984
00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cartoon will never be funny enough.</v>

985
00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:03.380
<v Speaker 1>The joke will never be funny enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A novel will never be good enough and so</v>

986
00:49:03.381 --> 00:49:03.800
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

987
00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:08.630
<v Speaker 1>and then in the end the speech will </v>
<v Speaker 1>never be worth speaking enough.</v>

988
00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

989
00:49:10.151 --> 00:49:12.290
<v Speaker 1>a little while ago had a very clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of this.</v>

990
00:49:12.291 --> 00:49:17.291
<v Speaker 1>I read about it on the radio in Britain </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I was in discussion with a Muslim </v>

991
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:21.341
<v Speaker 1>cleric who was sort of reformist </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring meyer in some ways who in a </v>

992
00:49:21.341 --> 00:49:24.260
<v Speaker 1>discussion about something said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

993
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:27.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also Muhammad Prophet Muhammad,</v>

994
00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:27.800
<v Speaker 1>peace be upon him.</v>

995
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was he took criticism in his and he took</v>

996
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:31.550
<v Speaker 1>criticism very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

997
00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:33.410
<v Speaker 1>He never mind that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People criticizing him.</v>

998
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:38.900
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's absolute crap.</v>

999
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:40.970
<v Speaker 1>That is real crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1000
00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:45.390
<v Speaker 1>whatever else you can say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Mohammed not really good on this,</v>

1001
00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:50.460
<v Speaker 1>on the criticism of himself bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I gave an example of a female </v>

1002
00:49:50.661 --> 00:49:55.661
<v Speaker 1>protests who he had killed because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized him and this guy went </v>

1003
00:49:55.661 --> 00:49:59.300
<v Speaker 1>absolutely ape shit and refused to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue and so on.</v>

1004
00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:04.330
<v Speaker 1>And because you gave an actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical example from his own </v>

1005
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:09.010
<v Speaker 1>religious texts and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the end it was a prerecorded CNN,</v>

1006
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:10.910
<v Speaker 1>the BBC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can this,</v>

1007
00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:14.830
<v Speaker 1>can you find another way of trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the same point and you know,</v>

1008
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.520
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was what we had to do.</v>

1009
00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Another way of making the same point </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than pointing out the historical </v>

1010
00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:26.220
<v Speaker 2>pxe that showed that Mohammed did have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>female poet killed.</v>

1011
00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just one other</v>

1012
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.630
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would there be to make that point?</v>

1013
00:50:29.631 --> 00:50:32.720
<v Speaker 1>That is hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the ultimate way to make that</v>

1014
00:50:32.721 --> 00:50:33.440
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1015
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Which is by pointing to the texts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the facts.</v>

1016
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:41.290
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can think of no other situation in </v>

1017
00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:43.760
<v Speaker 1>which somebody has veto rights like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1018
00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a normal discussion.</v>

1019
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:47.350
<v Speaker 1>And it's because they are terrified of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the retaliation.</v>

1020
00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:47.720
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1021
00:50:47.721 --> 00:50:49.700
<v Speaker 1>I knew everyone in the production box </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1022
00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.880
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's Douglas Dunn?</v>

1023
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:57.030
<v Speaker 1>So how can we stop it affecting us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was this clerics response to that </v>

1024
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.740
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1025
00:50:57.741 --> 00:50:58.120
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1026
00:50:58.310 --> 00:50:58.960
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1027
00:50:59.410 --> 00:50:59.840
<v Speaker 1>went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1028
00:50:59.841 --> 00:51:04.841
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit nuts and wouldn't continue</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless I wouldn't say that.</v>

1029
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And so what did he deny that it was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1030
00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.210
<v Speaker 1>I said I was making it up and I was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>liar.</v>

1031
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:15.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm used to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

1032
00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:19.510
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy thing for him to say when</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone could just read the text.</v>

1033
00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they were banking on nobody doing </v>

1034
00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:24.930
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1035
00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:25.300
<v Speaker 1>not this day and age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't bank on that.</v>

1036
00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1037
00:51:25.961 --> 00:51:27.760
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the releasing things,</v>

1038
00:51:27.761 --> 00:51:29.170
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because although it's true,</v>

1039
00:51:29.171 --> 00:51:32.770
<v Speaker 1>you can suppress a lot of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1040
00:51:32.771 --> 00:51:37.771
<v Speaker 1>we do live in an age when basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone can google and find texts and </v>

1041
00:51:37.771 --> 00:51:39.460
<v Speaker 1>they can just find a time that a billion</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have read.</v>

1042
00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure they've read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

1043
00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Well possess it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people you think read it?</v>

1044
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:45.970
<v Speaker 1>How many people you think read the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bible?</v>

1045
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess there are a number of Christians </v>

1046
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:54.301
<v Speaker 1>in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those tests aren't that they'd </v>

1047
00:51:54.301 --> 00:51:57.290
<v Speaker 1>sometimes to the humanists sudden did a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few years ago asking very basic </v>

1048
00:51:57.290 --> 00:52:01.890
<v Speaker 1>questions of self professed Christians </v>
<v Speaker 1>about their knowledge of the texts and </v>

1049
00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:05.620
<v Speaker 1>very few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite is self professed Christians</v>

1050
00:52:05.621 --> 00:52:08.140
<v Speaker 1>with religious tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1051
00:52:08.141 --> 00:52:10.060
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to read the whole book.</v>

1052
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Like you are literally showing on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin that you didn't read the whole </v>

1053
00:52:16.361 --> 00:52:21.361
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't pay attention to don't do </v>

1054
00:52:21.361 --> 00:52:21.361
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1055
00:52:21.361 --> 00:52:23.200
<v Speaker 1>This is Leviticus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leviticus.</v>

1056
00:52:23.201 --> 00:52:25.450
<v Speaker 1>It says that it's got the implications </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the writing.</v>

1057
00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I say if you read limited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a heck of a lot you can't do.</v>

1058
00:52:29.451 --> 00:52:29.820
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

1059
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:35.170
<v Speaker 1>if you go down Leviticus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't wear two pieces of different </v>

1060
00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:35.170
<v Speaker 1>cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1061
00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:35.890
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1062
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Leviticus is a wonderful book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be.</v>

1063
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:42.970
<v Speaker 1>It's very good for them because what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Vegas wasn't the one which was the </v>

1064
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:47.251
<v Speaker 1>book where the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm called upon the sheet bear to kill </v>

1065
00:52:47.251 --> 00:52:48.730
<v Speaker 1>the children who were mocking his </v>
<v Speaker 1>baldness.</v>

1066
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite special bald guy.</v>

1067
00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:00.440
<v Speaker 1>This guy was getting mocked by children </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking kids and God called upon a.</v>

1068
00:53:01.921 --> 00:53:06.921
<v Speaker 1>She bear to come down and tear apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>these children who were making fun of </v>

1069
00:53:07.741 --> 00:53:08.960
<v Speaker 1>his bald head here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1072
00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went up to pat.</v>

1073
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:19.020
<v Speaker 1>If you are going to intervene in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>affairs for anything,</v>

1074
00:53:19.021 --> 00:53:24.021
<v Speaker 1>this would be the time when God's got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>step in this kind of stuff.</v>

1075
00:53:24.541 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Going young kids,</v>

1076
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.070
<v Speaker 3>young kids came out from the city and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mocked him and said to him,</v>

1077
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.370
<v Speaker 3>go up you bald head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go up you bald head,</v>

1078
00:53:32.371 --> 00:53:37.371
<v Speaker 3>which is very mild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when he looked behind him and saw </v>

1079
00:53:37.371 --> 00:53:39.870
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he cursed them in the name of the Lord,</v>

1080
00:53:39.871 --> 00:53:44.871
<v Speaker 3>all caps than two female bears came out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the woods and tore up 42 lads have </v>

1081
00:53:46.531 --> 00:53:49.740
<v Speaker 3>their number and he went from there to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mount Carmel.</v>

1082
00:53:49.741 --> 00:53:51.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's over.</v>

1083
00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:53.250
<v Speaker 3>Got It done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1084
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:53.700
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1085
00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my favorite reading from </v>

1086
00:53:58.820 --> 00:53:59.970
<v Speaker 1>scripture was about the end of one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the books that come in.</v>

1087
00:53:59.971 --> 00:54:04.971
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was over the course when I was young </v>

1088
00:54:04.971 --> 00:54:05.940
<v Speaker 1>and I always made me laugh if there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a destruction of the city of Nineveh.</v>

1089
00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:11.540
<v Speaker 1>It finished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think not any finish this chapter of </v>

1090
00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:11.540
<v Speaker 1>the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

1091
00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:11.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1092
00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:13.350
<v Speaker 1>and low in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that city where</v>

1093
00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:18.660
<v Speaker 3>40,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>human souls that were destroyed and had </v>

1094
00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:23.191
<v Speaker 3>also some cattle cattle just by </v>
<v Speaker 3>association,</v>

1095
00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:25.690
<v Speaker 3>some cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad cows.</v>

1096
00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:28.530
<v Speaker 3>There are bad cows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God had a fuck up those cows too.</v>

1097
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:30.130
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

1098
00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.870
<v Speaker 3>the bald headed one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1099
00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:33.590
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's uh,</v>

1100
00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:34.860
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a heck of a time to,</v>

1101
00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.390
<v Speaker 3>to tread into him to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an insult,</v>

1102
00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:42.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had your bald head is just an accurate </v>

1103
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:42.790
<v Speaker 3>description.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is not an insult.</v>

1104
00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.980
<v Speaker 3>If you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ugly,</v>

1105
00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:48.160
<v Speaker 3>sloppy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>baldheaded loser.</v>

1106
00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then maybe God needs to step in and send</v>

1107
00:54:51.311 --> 00:54:56.311
<v Speaker 3>some wolves to attack yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why do they specify that they're </v>

1108
00:54:56.311 --> 00:54:56.311
<v Speaker 3>female?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1109
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Why is it female 30 to have that number?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1110
00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:02.740
<v Speaker 3>Forty two kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two bears head.</v>

<v Speaker 3>learn how to run.</v>

1112
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:10.710
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck those bears even catch all </v>

1113
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.930
<v Speaker 3>42 of those kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of kids they raised over there</v>

1114
00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:12.220
<v Speaker 3>in Bethel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

1115
00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't get the fuck out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1116
00:55:16.841 --> 00:55:21.841
<v Speaker 3>they're all sitting around waiting their</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn mean trying out curse words to </v>

1117
00:55:21.841 --> 00:55:26.170
<v Speaker 3>causes the best to come down you shaggy </v>
<v Speaker 3>bear.</v>

1118
00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.480
<v Speaker 3>That didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Shaggy.</v>

1119
00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Mangy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dirty,</v>

1120
00:55:30.731 --> 00:55:33.030
<v Speaker 3>stinky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bare bulb.</v>

1121
00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:39.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many of those stories that </v>

1122
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:39.330
<v Speaker 3>are so strange.</v>

1123
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet that most,</v>

1124
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:40.480
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were to go to the,</v>

1125
00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:44.650
<v Speaker 1>the people who say that that question is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the polls and ask them about,</v>

1126
00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:47.200
<v Speaker 1>we don't even need to go to the bolthead</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

1127
00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:53.550
<v Speaker 1>They don't accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't even bother reading </v>

1128
00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:53.560
<v Speaker 1>that because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost too crazy.</v>

1129
00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1130
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:55.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1131
00:55:55.111 --> 00:55:56.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm very,</v>

1132
00:55:56.471 --> 00:55:58.570
<v Speaker 1>very little knowledge even about very </v>
<v Speaker 1>basic things.</v>

1133
00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1134
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:03.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even commandments and so on.</v>

1135
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:08.720
<v Speaker 1>So that's the case with the religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in America and Britain is known </v>

1136
00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:12.321
<v Speaker 1>best with Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no reason to assume that </v>

1137
00:56:12.321 --> 00:56:12.321
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case with Islam as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't</v>

1138
00:56:12.321 --> 00:56:12.850
<v Speaker 3>that just the case with people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1139
00:56:12.851 --> 00:56:15.310
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be the same thing that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about with headlines.</v>

1140
00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:20.490
<v Speaker 3>Someone reads a headlines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't bother reading into it and </v>

1141
00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:20.490
<v Speaker 3>then they accuse someone of something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like with religion,</v>

1142
00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:22.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Christian and I'm a Christian man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

1143
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Please me about the Bible,</v>

1144
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1145
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:26.790
<v Speaker 4>Uh Huh.</v>

1146
00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something I've often thought.</v>

1147
00:56:30.381 --> 00:56:35.381
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the reasons why it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to get a sudden fanaticism </v>

1148
00:56:35.381 --> 00:56:39.071
<v Speaker 1>going within Muslim communities on some </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues to do with best for me is I think</v>

1149
00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:41.360
<v Speaker 1>is to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1150
00:56:41.361 --> 00:56:46.361
<v Speaker 1>a realization of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said that this was the case about </v>

1151
00:56:46.461 --> 00:56:48.920
<v Speaker 1>our prophet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

1152
00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:53.590
<v Speaker 1>I know he did what I had all my adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>life with,</v>

1153
00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.270
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1154
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:59.290
<v Speaker 1>arguing with Muslims about things the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they very rarely know for the problems </v>

1155
00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:04.700
<v Speaker 1>in their own tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you bring them up,</v>

1156
00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:05.450
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>

1157
00:57:05.451 --> 00:57:07.890
<v Speaker 1>what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a,</v>

1158
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:13.050
<v Speaker 1>like the Christians with the bold bets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this causes a really serious problem</v>

1159
00:57:13.851 --> 00:57:18.851
<v Speaker 1>for them because they are told from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cradle that the,</v>

1160
00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:24.350
<v Speaker 1>that they are following a religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>founded by the most perfect man </v>

1161
00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:25.850
<v Speaker 1>imaginable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you discover that,</v>

1162
00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.180
<v Speaker 1>if you know there's no description of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Helen,</v>

1163
00:57:29.181 --> 00:57:32.720
<v Speaker 1>of troy in ancient text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does nobody described handled?</v>

1164
00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't it reset the unit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was so you had this beautiful blonde</v>

1165
00:57:36.261 --> 00:57:39.650
<v Speaker 1>ringlets order is because it actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>catches on as a,</v>

1166
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:42.110
<v Speaker 1>as a theme because everyone makes Helen </v>
<v Speaker 1>of troy,</v>

1167
00:57:42.111 --> 00:57:45.310
<v Speaker 1>their most beautiful woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you start describing,</v>

1168
00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:46.720
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into red heads.</v>

1169
00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would write hello toy becomes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person upon whom you put all of those </v>

1170
00:57:54.711 --> 00:57:57.320
<v Speaker 1>things and in the same way Mohammed </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes,</v>

1171
00:57:57.321 --> 00:57:59.270
<v Speaker 1>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the perfect human being,</v>

1172
00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:04.810
<v Speaker 1>people will just throw their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the kinds of things they think are </v>

1173
00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:04.810
<v Speaker 1>perfect onto Mohammed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must have been very kind,</v>

1174
00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:05.970
<v Speaker 1>very generous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very caregiving,</v>

1175
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:08.780
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that if you then say,</v>

1176
00:58:08.781 --> 00:58:11.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about when he vented this?</v>

1177
00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I think it just causes an extra hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something we'll have to get </v>

1178
00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:17.450
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1179
00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:22.010
<v Speaker 1>because we can't go away and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify these,</v>

1180
00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.420
<v Speaker 1>these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1181
00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:25.700
<v Speaker 1>but it causes in the short term and </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous,</v>

1182
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.000
<v Speaker 1>enormous pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an example I gave recently in a </v>

1183
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:31.000
<v Speaker 1>book of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1184
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.170
<v Speaker 1>somebody I spent some time with a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago to extraordinary man called </v>

1185
00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:36.110
<v Speaker 1>morten storm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1186
00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:40.790
<v Speaker 1>he was a Danish biker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big in a biker gang in Denmark.</v>

1187
00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:44.510
<v Speaker 1>I went to prison and in prison about </v>
<v Speaker 1>$2,000.</v>

1188
00:58:44.511 --> 00:58:48.290
<v Speaker 1>So he converted to Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He converted to Al Qaeda.</v>

1189
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a,</v>

1190
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:53.510
<v Speaker 1>not a common person in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1191
00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:58.440
<v Speaker 1>he ended up being the main go to person </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some of our luck.</v>

1192
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:02.620
<v Speaker 1>He was the head of al Qaeda in Yemen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact was asked to give him a,</v>

1193
00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:07.650
<v Speaker 1>get a wife our lucky to supplement his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife collection and a modesto among </v>

1194
00:59:08.291 --> 00:59:13.291
<v Speaker 1>other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up falling out with our kid and </v>

1195
00:59:13.291 --> 00:59:16.000
<v Speaker 1>ended up working for the CIA and Danish </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and ended up helping lead </v>

1196
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.040
<v Speaker 1>them to our lucky who was then droned by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama in 2011 or so.</v>

1197
00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to motor storm,</v>

1198
00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:26.330
<v Speaker 1>what was the moment that made you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of Al Qaeda?</v>

1199
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:28.850
<v Speaker 1>And he has such a fascinating on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

1200
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:33.950
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came out of al Qaeda and Islam the </v>

1201
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:33.950
<v Speaker 1>same moment.</v>

1202
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:34.640
<v Speaker 1>He says what was happening was he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in his,</v>

1203
00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:40.080
<v Speaker 1>he was waiting for a package when kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of drop off to get them from him to our </v>

1204
00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.850
<v Speaker 1>lucky and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1205
00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:46.880
<v Speaker 1>the person carrying the package was late</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then really late and he was sitting </v>

1206
00:59:47.001 --> 00:59:49.250
<v Speaker 1>in his apartment somewhere in Germany I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think at that point.</v>

1207
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:54.730
<v Speaker 1>And he was so pissed off about this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a laptop that was there on the </v>

1208
00:59:55.131 --> 01:00:00.131
<v Speaker 1>table and he thought basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I express my pissed off with my </v>

1209
01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.940
<v Speaker 1>al Qaeda colleagues for wasting my time </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this so much.</v>

1210
01:00:04.941 --> 01:00:09.941
<v Speaker 1>And he went to Google and typed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions in Islam and began to </v>

1211
01:00:10.971 --> 01:00:11.480
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

1212
01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was how he got out.</v>

1213
01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what did him in.</v>

1214
01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Someone's being late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just started reading again.</v>

1215
01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:23.320
<v Speaker 1>They told me this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never told me that.</v>

1216
01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I never knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was.</v>

1217
01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:28.060
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I say,</v>

1218
01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:29.680
<v Speaker 1>he's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very uncommon.</v>

1219
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:36.010
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that might be happening </v>

1220
01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:38.080
<v Speaker 1>quite a lot more than we know people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just googling things,</v>

1221
01:00:38.081 --> 01:00:40.700
<v Speaker 1>finding stuff out for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the most dangerous route.</v>

1222
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Religion to leave because they kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>apostates.</v>

1223
01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1224
01:00:45.281 --> 01:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>So how is he dealing with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1225
01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives in hidings.</v>

1226
01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1227
01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1228
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't see me.</v>

1229
01:00:54.101 --> 01:00:57.670
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called agents dorm about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it two years ago.</v>

1230
01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>One of the weirdest conversation that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever saw anybody have with someone who </v>

1231
01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:07.741
<v Speaker 1>is a believer was Dawkins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was was having a conversation</v>

1232
01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:13.531
<v Speaker 1>with someone and he asked him point </v>
<v Speaker 1>blank whether or not he believed that </v>

1233
01:01:13.531 --> 01:01:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed split the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

1234
01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I think I know this was with Vaco is </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy of mine called Media Hassan who </v>

1235
01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>worked for Al Jazeera and who Richard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dawkins did an interview with and I </v>

1236
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:28.861
<v Speaker 1>think he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why he fluffed something earlier </v>

1237
01:01:28.861 --> 01:01:31.840
<v Speaker 1>on a dog is that he didn't take it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he took him on this.</v>

1238
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that Sun City,</v>

1239
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.270
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1240
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it lead to this terrible </v>

1241
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>problem which is really interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinct problem of our era,</v>

1242
01:01:41.321 --> 01:01:42.940
<v Speaker 1>which is then dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1243
01:01:42.941 --> 01:01:44.620
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that somebody or said </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>

1244
01:01:44.621 --> 01:01:47.500
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that somebody can be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>working journalist and believe that,</v>

1245
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed slipped and half human horse.</v>

1246
01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1247
01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's an interesting point </v>

1248
01:01:58.110 --> 01:02:01.381
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course we do quite rightly allow </v>

1249
01:02:01.381 --> 01:02:01.381
<v Speaker 1>people to believe</v>

1250
01:02:01.381 --> 01:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>bizarre and insane thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity was bizarre.</v>

1251
01:02:05.491 --> 01:02:10.491
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we started saying you can't have </v>

1252
01:02:10.491 --> 01:02:12.471
<v Speaker 1>public office or work in journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you profess to be of this particular </v>

1253
01:02:12.471 --> 01:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we wouldn't get anyway.</v>

1254
01:02:12.571 --> 01:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't have anyone left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how does the story go?</v>

1255
01:02:15.001 --> 01:02:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed flew to the moon on a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>human horse and split the moon with a.</v>

1256
01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:21.020
<v Speaker 1>is that what he did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

1257
01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>He could have then been attacked by </v>
<v Speaker 1>female beds,</v>

1258
01:02:23.521 --> 01:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>but I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1259
01:02:24.861 --> 01:02:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1260
01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>he gets the night journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a central.</v>

1261
01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Has the moon get glued back together </v>
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>

1262
01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Is it glued back together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it is.</v>

1263
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:40.370
<v Speaker 1>I haven't looked close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I need to pay more attention to </v>

1264
01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:42.740
<v Speaker 1>the fact that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1265
01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I believe this was a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say it was 2010 that this </v>

1266
01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.711
<v Speaker 1>interview or the debate took place </v>
<v Speaker 1>around them eight years ago that someone</v>

1267
01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.450
<v Speaker 1>would be comfortable saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1268
01:02:54.451 --> 01:02:55.970
<v Speaker 1>that they believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1269
01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>let me see.</v>

1270
01:02:56.370 --> 01:03:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I got into a little bit of trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dawkins got a bit annoyed about </v>

1271
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:01.370
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1272
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:05.700
<v Speaker 1>because I took the mickey out of him for</v>
<v Speaker 1>dodging the one earlier in that it was </v>

1273
01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:05.820
<v Speaker 1>the earlier one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1274
01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm a great admirer of Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1275
01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.080
<v Speaker 1>is everyone is sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1276
01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1277
01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:15.390
<v Speaker 1>he knows exactly where the cliff edge </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1278
01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:19.100
<v Speaker 1>And in that interview he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1279
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:22.680
<v Speaker 1>he was asked on allergies era by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

1280
01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:26.160
<v Speaker 1>He see read out the bit from the God </v>
<v Speaker 1>delusion about,</v>

1281
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:31.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a great bit of rhetoric about the </v>

1282
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the swipes God is something like the </v>

1283
01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>most appalling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic,</v>

1284
01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:34.680
<v Speaker 1>murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1285
01:03:34.681 --> 01:03:35.010
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

1286
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Character in all of fiction is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrific piece of writing.</v>

1287
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>And the interviewer says to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1288
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:42.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1289
01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>you stand by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the description of the </v>

1290
01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God says,</v>

1291
01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1292
01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:48.600
<v Speaker 1>use it as a description of the Jewish.</v>

1293
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.830
<v Speaker 1>God says yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he says,</v>

1294
01:03:49.831 --> 01:03:51.840
<v Speaker 1>and what do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing about the Muslim God.</v>

1295
01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:55.170
<v Speaker 1>And I just knew exactly what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

1296
01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:58.500
<v Speaker 1>And Richard Dawkins says about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim God,</v>

1297
01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.700
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he,</v>

1298
01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1299
01:04:02.501 --> 01:04:02.910
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1300
01:04:02.911 --> 01:04:05.280
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks I shouldn't rip him on this.</v>

1301
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.920
<v Speaker 1>And the thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I noticed was just,</v>

1302
01:04:07.921 --> 01:04:12.921
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely felt it's been very brave </v>

1303
01:04:12.921 --> 01:04:15.591
<v Speaker 1>and brilliant writer and thinker on </v>
<v Speaker 1>these matters and nobody's done more in </v>

1304
01:04:15.591 --> 01:04:16.560
<v Speaker 1>some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

1305
01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:20.940
<v Speaker 1>I knew exactly what was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was staring right over the cliff edge</v>

1306
01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:26.090
<v Speaker 1>and somebody was behind him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nudging and that if he had said,</v>

1307
01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.590
<v Speaker 1>as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live on Al Jazeera,</v>

1308
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allah,</v>

1309
01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:32.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the total bastard,</v>

1310
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:35.480
<v Speaker 1>then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1311
01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:40.490
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's maybe your then in real </v>

1312
01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:40.490
<v Speaker 1>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1313
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.560
<v Speaker 1>And so he stepped back from the brink </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I rather cruelly perhaps taking the </v>

1314
01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>mickey out of him afterward.</v>

1315
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I said that it was just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dawkins was demonstrating the </v>

1316
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.531
<v Speaker 1>survival instinct of his species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I feel bad about it,</v>

1317
01:04:54.571 --> 01:04:55.680
<v Speaker 1>but it is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is true.</v>

1318
01:04:55.890 --> 01:05:00.890
<v Speaker 1>But we've all been there to some extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what was his response to that </v>

1319
01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:02.910
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To my junior criticism?</v>

1320
01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:04.560
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1321
01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:07.500
<v Speaker 1>well he basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1322
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.560
<v Speaker 1>I think he did take it on board in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1323
01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:12.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex reasons,</v>

1324
01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:15.000
<v Speaker 1>but I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1325
01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>I know he was also annoyed that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he,</v>

1326
01:05:17.291 --> 01:05:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I think he felt that I was doing that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1327
01:05:19.301 --> 01:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Then you do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1328
01:05:21.581 --> 01:05:22.480
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1329
01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:28.260
<v Speaker 1>and that is very common in that I've had</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot in my life in this particular</v>

1330
01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:33.691
<v Speaker 1>area of people trying to egg me over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you say that course and uh,</v>

1331
01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:40.890
<v Speaker 1>and you know that they're the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who'll be a million miles behind you </v>

1332
01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:41.410
<v Speaker 1>with their ears plugged.</v>

1333
01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I behind a wall.</v>

1334
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.710
<v Speaker 1>I always have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always have a very,</v>

1335
01:05:44.711 --> 01:05:47.180
<v Speaker 1>very visual aid of era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who actually is,</v>

1336
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:52.190
<v Speaker 1>is a terrific reformer in Islam that now</v>
<v Speaker 1>under another cleric who wants to </v>

1337
01:05:52.711 --> 01:05:57.711
<v Speaker 1>describe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to fight for the Mujahideen in </v>

1338
01:05:57.711 --> 01:05:59.431
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan and a study years ago now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And describe to me that he's not a very </v>

1339
01:05:59.431 --> 01:06:02.200
<v Speaker 1>fittingly like person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but described how he did that to sort of</v>

1340
01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:04.870
<v Speaker 1>rile them up to sort of run over and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the Soviets.</v>

1341
01:06:04.871 --> 01:06:06.100
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1342
01:06:06.101 --> 01:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>we're all agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1343
01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:12.290
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go and he worked 20 odd guys.</v>

1344
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't everyone else stayed in the </v>

1345
01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.431
<v Speaker 1>trench?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've always thought this is exactly </v>

1346
01:06:20.431 --> 01:06:20.431
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1347
01:06:20.431 --> 01:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>the experience of anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1348
01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.350
<v Speaker 2>This area is that there's an inherent </v>
<v Speaker 2>danger in this criticism.</v>

1349
01:06:25.351 --> 01:06:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Even this discussion right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's people right now firing</v>

1350
01:06:29.041 --> 01:06:33.600
<v Speaker 2>up their webcams and writing blogs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweeting and getting upset about it.</v>

1351
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:38.880
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any rational discussion of that </v>

1352
01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.290
<v Speaker 2>particular subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could kind of get away.</v>

1353
01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get criticism from Christians,</v>

1354
01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:45.720
<v Speaker 2>but it's not scary,</v>

1355
01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:47.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1356
01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.620
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1357
01:06:49.770 --> 01:06:51.570
<v Speaker 1>that is a big difference at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing isn't it?</v>

1358
01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:56.980
<v Speaker 1>This is this just something that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to a nuance that almost never </v>

1359
01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:01.461
<v Speaker 1>gets added in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course we all just assume it so </v>

1360
01:07:01.461 --> 01:07:03.501
<v Speaker 1>we don't think it's worth saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are aware that any religion or </v>

1361
01:07:03.501 --> 01:07:06.180
<v Speaker 1>for like this could be this dangerous at</v>
<v Speaker 1>different phases.</v>

1362
01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might've wanted to be in Spain in </v>

1363
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:13.500
<v Speaker 1>certain points in the last millennium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1364
01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might not have,</v>

1365
01:07:15.931 --> 01:07:20.931
<v Speaker 1>wanted to be a Catholic center at </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain points or Protestant descend to </v>

1366
01:07:20.931 --> 01:07:20.931
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on and so forth.</v>

1367
01:07:20.931 --> 01:07:21.240
<v Speaker 1>We all know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1368
01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:25.530
<v Speaker 1>it's just that at the moment that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty crescent and uh,</v>

1369
01:07:25.531 --> 01:07:30.531
<v Speaker 1>and quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course it's less quiet here than </v>

1370
01:07:30.531 --> 01:07:33.411
<v Speaker 1>it is in my country on condo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the Anglican church becoming </v>

1371
01:07:33.411 --> 01:07:34.260
<v Speaker 1>militant about anything at any point </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>

1372
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:39.990
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do have some angry or types of </v>

1373
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Christian here than we have in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1374
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:41.910
<v Speaker 1>And so it's easy for me to think they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly less,</v>

1375
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1376
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:46.580
<v Speaker 1>risky at some point in the future than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new might.</v>

1377
01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:51.590
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just that we do recognize this </v>

1378
01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:51.590
<v Speaker 1>could happen elsewhere as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

1379
01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:51.590
<v Speaker 1>at the moment it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1380
01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:56.590
<v Speaker 1>it's not the quakers that they really </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't send me a death threat from one </v>

1381
01:07:58.171 --> 01:08:01.740
<v Speaker 1>year to the next rather nice people.</v>

1382
01:08:02.330 --> 01:08:07.330
<v Speaker 2>There is an inherent danger of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>retaliation from people who are more </v>

1383
01:08:09.171 --> 01:08:14.171
<v Speaker 2>radical Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if this continues and if you see </v>

1384
01:08:14.171 --> 01:08:18.320
<v Speaker 2>more and more of more and more attacks </v>
<v Speaker 2>from people of Muslim faith,</v>

1385
01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.680
<v Speaker 2>you could possibly see a retaliation </v>
<v Speaker 2>from people.</v>

1386
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Especially in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like after nine slash 11,</v>

1387
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:30.010
<v Speaker 2>there was an extreme amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of hate for Muslims and irrational hate </v>

1388
01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:36.330
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong to the Sikhs as I </v>

1389
01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:36.330
<v Speaker 2>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1390
01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:39.461
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of that out of </v>

1391
01:08:39.461 --> 01:08:39.461
<v Speaker 2>ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just didn't.</v>

1392
01:08:39.461 --> 01:08:42.430
<v Speaker 2>They didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was the most disturbing </v>

1393
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:44.711
<v Speaker 2>because Sikhs are pretty interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and the fact that they just </v>

1394
01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.730
<v Speaker 2>instantaneously with no information at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

1395
01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:51.680
<v Speaker 2>no understanding out of complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorance attack them.</v>

1396
01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1397
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:57.040
<v Speaker 1>I have a second to no one in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>gloominess about some of the things that</v>

1398
01:08:57.041 --> 01:08:59.470
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go through in Britain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe in the coming years.</v>

1399
01:08:59.471 --> 01:09:04.471
<v Speaker 1>But I recently had a reason to even more</v>
<v Speaker 1>gloomy about one aspect of it relating </v>

1400
01:09:05.471 --> 01:09:06.550
<v Speaker 1>to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this.</v>

1401
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:11.840
<v Speaker 1>We had a three big bad terrorist attacks</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year in,</v>

1402
01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:12.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the UK,</v>

1403
01:09:12.911 --> 01:09:16.810
<v Speaker 1>including the Manchester Arena bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty two young people were blown up on</v>

1404
01:09:16.811 --> 01:09:18.640
<v Speaker 1>a Monday night for going to hear Ariana </v>
<v Speaker 1>Grande Day.</v>

1405
01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1406
01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:26.200
<v Speaker 1>after the third of those attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was on London Bridge,</v>

1407
01:09:26.201 --> 01:09:31.201
<v Speaker 1>when a three people who are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>known to authorities as they generally </v>

1408
01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:35.641
<v Speaker 1>are a slash people's throats on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street and ran to borough market is </v>

1409
01:09:35.641 --> 01:09:39.400
<v Speaker 1>people were drinking and stabbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are shouting.</v>

1410
01:09:39.401 --> 01:09:42.100
<v Speaker 1>This is for Allah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the third of those attacks,</v>

1411
01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:44.650
<v Speaker 1>it was felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

1412
01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.930
<v Speaker 1>is this really just got to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening?</v>

1413
01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:49.900
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to do about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what can we do?</v>

1414
01:09:49.901 --> 01:09:51.730
<v Speaker 1>And after the Manchester one in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

1415
01:09:51.731 --> 01:09:54.550
<v Speaker 1>there was this kind of thing of everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1416
01:09:54.551 --> 01:09:57.340
<v Speaker 1>apart from John Lennon's imagine there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the oasis hit,</v>

1417
01:09:57.341 --> 01:10:02.341
<v Speaker 1>don't look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look back in anger and these </v>

1418
01:10:02.341 --> 01:10:05.401
<v Speaker 1>themes that we weren't meant to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything other than that we weren't </v>

1419
01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:06.250
<v Speaker 1>meant to be angry and went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1420
01:10:06.251 --> 01:10:11.251
<v Speaker 1>then then just a terrible thing happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>from another direction,</v>

1421
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:14.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside Finsbury Park mosque,</v>

1422
01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:19.890
<v Speaker 1>which the muscular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very troubled and bad history in London.</v>

1423
01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm a guy from Wales in a van,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drives into the crowds as the milling </v>

1424
01:10:26.651 --> 01:10:31.651
<v Speaker 1>around outside the mosque,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kills one man and enjoys a number of </v>

1425
01:10:31.651 --> 01:10:32.690
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1426
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:34.030
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1427
01:10:34.031 --> 01:10:36.790
<v Speaker 1>just show how complex all this can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

1428
01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was tried,</v>

1429
01:10:38.261 --> 01:10:41.530
<v Speaker 1>found guilty last month in the courts in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK.</v>

1430
01:10:41.890 --> 01:10:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1431
01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:44.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had been,</v>

1432
01:10:44.771 --> 01:10:49.771
<v Speaker 1>he loves you very mentally deranged and </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a history of mental illness and all </v>

1433
01:10:49.771 --> 01:10:51.400
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing is very often people </v>
<v Speaker 1>do in these situations.</v>

1434
01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.200
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1435
01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:56.080
<v Speaker 1>he had watched the BBC drama called </v>
<v Speaker 1>three girls,</v>

1436
01:10:56.081 --> 01:11:01.010
<v Speaker 1>which is a first time that the BBC had </v>
<v Speaker 1>really addressed the issue of the rather</v>

1437
01:11:01.011 --> 01:11:06.011
<v Speaker 1>than Rochdale rape gangs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happened in the last decade in the </v>

1438
01:11:06.011 --> 01:11:06.820
<v Speaker 1>UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is still a sore that's going on.</v>

1439
01:11:06.821 --> 01:11:08.980
<v Speaker 1>We're about 1500 girls in one town </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

1440
01:11:08.981 --> 01:11:13.981
<v Speaker 1>We're basically a abused by gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them,</v>

1441
01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:17.670
<v Speaker 1>mainly Pakistani men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very,</v>

1442
01:11:17.671 --> 01:11:22.671
<v Speaker 1>very ugly business partly because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>so awful that nobody that nobody at the </v>

1443
01:11:22.771 --> 01:11:25.520
<v Speaker 1>state and the police level and he wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look into it.</v>

1444
01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:29.930
<v Speaker 1>They are now the government inquiries </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they didn't look into it so worried</v>

1445
01:11:29.931 --> 01:11:31.890
<v Speaker 1>about being called racist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobia console.</v>

1446
01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:36.120
<v Speaker 1>The press did a lot of not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in this as well.</v>

1447
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Eventually after all these years of BBC </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a documentary called three girls,</v>

1448
01:11:40.711 --> 01:11:45.711
<v Speaker 1>about three of the girls who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffered from these rape gangs and then </v>

1449
01:11:45.711 --> 01:11:50.330
<v Speaker 1>a man in Wales sees it and get so </v>
<v Speaker 1>enraged people say at the local pub he </v>

1450
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:51.570
<v Speaker 1>was railing against the bloody Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all this sort of thing,</v>

1451
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:57.200
<v Speaker 1>and then he hires a van and drives into </v>
<v Speaker 1>a crowd of people outside a mosque and </v>

1452
01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.600
<v Speaker 1>you have this awful feeling that the BBC</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to deal with the issue that </v>

1453
01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:07.851
<v Speaker 1>the program was about for years because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so awful and ugly and sounded </v>

1454
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:11.550
<v Speaker 1>like something made up by some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nativist,</v>

1455
01:12:11.551 --> 01:12:12.380
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1456
01:12:12.381 --> 01:12:12.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1457
01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.470
<v Speaker 1>it's had everything.</v>

1458
01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they do.</v>

1459
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:22.520
<v Speaker 1>And then it turns out the member of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public sees it and drove the van into a </v>

1460
01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:22.520
<v Speaker 1>crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1461
01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:22.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1462
01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:26.670
<v Speaker 1>this sort of couldn't get more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought after that,</v>

1463
01:12:26.671 --> 01:12:27.450
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

1464
01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the BBC were right.</v>

1465
01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they should cover up the gangway </v>

1466
01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:36.240
<v Speaker 1>per 1500 girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the public can't cope with it.</v>

1467
01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they will get into vans now as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

1468
01:12:39.901 --> 01:12:44.901
<v Speaker 1>I know the British public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think fairly well and I think that </v>

1469
01:12:44.901 --> 01:12:45.720
<v Speaker 1>that guy in Wales a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unusual figure.</v>

1470
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:50.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think everyone's going to do </v>

1471
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:50.990
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're all like that wicked</v>

1472
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.970
<v Speaker 1>mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

1473
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know for sure everywhere.</v>

1474
01:12:55.981 --> 01:13:00.981
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened in this </v>

1475
01:13:00.981 --> 01:13:00.981
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have various other countries.</v>

1476
01:13:00.981 --> 01:13:02.160
<v Speaker 1>If there were three attacks like that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick succession,</v>

1477
01:13:02.161 --> 01:13:04.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is.</v>

1478
01:13:04.621 --> 01:13:09.621
<v Speaker 1>This is really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to get complex is </v>

1479
01:13:09.621 --> 01:13:10.050
<v Speaker 1>already complex</v>

1480
01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.660
<v Speaker 2>and the response to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's complex too.</v>

1481
01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:15.460
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

1482
01:13:15.461 --> 01:13:17.830
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are a journalist,</v>

1483
01:13:17.831 --> 01:13:22.240
<v Speaker 2>if you are a television channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you report on this?</v>

1484
01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Do you think about the responsibility of</v>
<v Speaker 2>alerting someone to these actual real </v>

1485
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:32.071
<v Speaker 2>atrocities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to force them to react on </v>

1486
01:13:32.071 --> 01:13:34.621
<v Speaker 2>innocent people that did nothing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of this mosque and the fact that </v>

1487
01:13:34.621 --> 01:13:37.981
<v Speaker 2>these people in this mosque or somehow </v>
<v Speaker 2>or another connected to these people </v>

1488
01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:41.371
<v Speaker 2>that did these horrible crimes just by </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtue of the fact they're in the same </v>

1489
01:13:41.371 --> 01:13:41.371
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane to.</v>

1490
01:13:41.371 --> 01:13:42.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all insane</v>

1491
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:45.780
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way through it is to say,</v>

1492
01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:51.260
<v Speaker 1>first I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can press all the time and I think </v>

1493
01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:51.800
<v Speaker 1>that it's worse than the British press </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1494
01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:54.870
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that self appointed role of believing</v>

1495
01:13:54.871 --> 01:13:57.750
<v Speaker 1>it's task is to stand between the public</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the facts,</v>

1496
01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:59.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of negotiate between the two,</v>

1497
01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what they think the public can cope </v>

1498
01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.140
<v Speaker 1>with or should know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then feed them that I'm the American</v>

1499
01:14:07.141 --> 01:14:11.010
<v Speaker 1>press teams to be rife with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That temptation as ours is.</v>

1500
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:14.470
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to be the only way around </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is to not,</v>

1501
01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:19.560
<v Speaker 1>not given to that and to try just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>publish the fact when they happen </v>

1502
01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.460
<v Speaker 1>because it's just obviously seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>much worse.</v>

1503
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.920
<v Speaker 1>We will know in political scandal what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>

1504
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:28.950
<v Speaker 1>the cover up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always the cover up and that that </v>

1505
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:29.110
<v Speaker 1>may be the case with all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

1506
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:34.470
<v Speaker 1>maybe the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument for just the papers </v>

1507
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:37.171
<v Speaker 1>explaining stuff that's happened is </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's maybe that's all they can </v>

1508
01:14:39.011 --> 01:14:44.011
<v Speaker 1>do and that it won't be just say to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a lot worse if you bottled this </v>

1509
01:14:44.591 --> 01:14:49.591
<v Speaker 1>up because otherwise people will get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that there is some conspiracy to </v>

1510
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 1>cover over certain stories and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be onto something.</v>

1511
01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.800
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about the millions of </v>

1512
01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.271
<v Speaker 2>people that must have seen that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story on the grape of 1500,</v>

1513
01:15:01.151 --> 01:15:06.151
<v Speaker 2>the fact that only one person responded </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way is pretty extraordinary in and </v>

1514
01:15:06.151 --> 01:15:06.151
<v Speaker 2>of itself.</v>

1515
01:15:06.151 --> 01:15:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1516
01:15:06.791 --> 01:15:07.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've,</v>

1517
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I would've thought on some of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1518
01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1519
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are,</v>

1520
01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:15.400
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of examples aren't good </v>
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>

1521
01:15:15.401 --> 01:15:20.260
<v Speaker 1>but when something bad happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Manchester Arena attack,</v>

1522
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:21.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1523
01:15:21.341 --> 01:15:24.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm amazed in a way that people are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>decent.</v>

1524
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so pleased they are,</v>

1525
01:15:26.471 --> 01:15:27.910
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really,</v>

1526
01:15:27.911 --> 01:15:31.000
<v Speaker 1>we don't go out looking for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>

1527
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1528
01:15:31.691 --> 01:15:32.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the public.</v>

1529
01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Certainly in Britain I can happily send,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the same in America public,</v>

1530
01:15:35.301 --> 01:15:39.820
<v Speaker 1>but we were not really lynch mobs </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting to be got going again,</v>

1531
01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:45.660
<v Speaker 1>but the expectation that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any possibility of creating us </v>

1532
01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:46.610
<v Speaker 1>in such a way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1533
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:52.230
<v Speaker 1>it's only by treating us as if we can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with ugly things that go on the,</v>

1534
01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:57.250
<v Speaker 1>you could see the situations where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>began to see the situation in which that</v>

1535
01:15:57.251 --> 01:15:58.780
<v Speaker 1>all goes wrong in that different way.</v>

1536
01:16:01.230 --> 01:16:04.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't envy their position,</v>

1537
01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.870
<v Speaker 2>especially trying to pick up the ball </v>
<v Speaker 2>from here.</v>

1538
01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With all the history and all the </v>

1539
01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.541
<v Speaker 2>terrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in England with so many </v>

1540
01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:17.751
<v Speaker 2>attacks over such a relatively short </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time where there was a very </v>

1541
01:16:17.751 --> 01:16:21.710
<v Speaker 2>small history of that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like this immediate eruption </v>

1542
01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:22.140
<v Speaker 2>of all these issues.</v>

1543
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country in some ways I wrote about </v>

1544
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:30.521
<v Speaker 1>in my lates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most is France where the book comes </v>

1545
01:16:30.521 --> 01:16:32.000
<v Speaker 1>out in translation there and a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>months time we're very interested to see</v>

1546
01:16:32.001 --> 01:16:37.001
<v Speaker 1>what happens because France even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we mentioned Charlie Hebdo,</v>

1547
01:16:37.311 --> 01:16:40.760
<v Speaker 1>but that 18 months or so it had was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1548
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd all sort of disappeared now </v>

1549
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.850
<v Speaker 1>everyday he's got bad news of some kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1550
01:16:46.851 --> 01:16:51.851
<v Speaker 1>to have a um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a major western capital city with 130 </v>

1551
01:16:51.851 --> 01:16:55.331
<v Speaker 1>people killed in an evening with </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple suicide bombings and people </v>

1552
01:16:55.331 --> 01:16:58.740
<v Speaker 1>being gunned down from mopeds as they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting outside a bar and you know,</v>

1553
01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:03.280
<v Speaker 1>another group of people going into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock concert and you know,</v>

1554
01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:08.410
<v Speaker 1>going through the disabled section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting everyone one by one in the </v>

1555
01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:11.891
<v Speaker 1>disabled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually catch them in the lavatories </v>

1556
01:17:11.891 --> 01:17:12.600
<v Speaker 1>and shooting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean the,</v>

1557
01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.070
<v Speaker 1>that happened in one night alone in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris.</v>

1558
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:19.740
<v Speaker 1>The Parisians didn't become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1559
01:17:19.741 --> 01:17:21.940
<v Speaker 1>they didn't become wicked terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>people or anything,</v>

1560
01:17:21.941 --> 01:17:24.200
<v Speaker 1>but they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think these,</v>

1561
01:17:24.201 --> 01:17:29.201
<v Speaker 1>I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these terrible events that </v>

1562
01:17:29.201 --> 01:17:29.330
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually,</v>

1563
01:17:29.331 --> 01:17:33.620
<v Speaker 1>what happens is they sink down to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lower level of our consciousness so that</v>

1564
01:17:33.621 --> 01:17:35.770
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what actually happens is we,</v>

1565
01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:40.800
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get over the immediate thing quite </v>

1566
01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.241
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something at the foundational level </v>

1567
01:17:43.241 --> 01:17:47.021
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a case nobody really wants to </v>

1568
01:17:47.021 --> 01:17:50.170
<v Speaker 1>linger on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was one in November in the UK </v>

1569
01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:51.410
<v Speaker 1>on Oxford Street wear because of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone does.</v>

1570
01:17:51.411 --> 01:17:52.790
<v Speaker 1>After these attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always say,</v>

1571
01:17:52.791 --> 01:17:53.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will not be changed.</v>

1572
01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Everyone tries to sort of channel the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit of Churchill and all that sort of</v>

1573
01:17:57.201 --> 01:17:58.670
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1574
01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.680
<v Speaker 1>in church you'll hear me roar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1575
01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:04.340
<v Speaker 1>and so and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually the,</v>

1576
01:18:04.341 --> 01:18:07.670
<v Speaker 1>the facts are otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In November on Oxford Street,</v>

1577
01:18:07.671 --> 01:18:12.671
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all we know is that there were two men </v>

1578
01:18:12.671 --> 01:18:14.390
<v Speaker 1>who may have had some disagreement on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the platform of a tube.</v>

1579
01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:17.720
<v Speaker 1>The tube platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever happened,</v>

1580
01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:22.721
<v Speaker 1>it was misunderstood by crowds and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed into a stampede out of the </v>

1581
01:18:22.721 --> 01:18:25.460
<v Speaker 1>tube station and all the way down Oxford</v>
<v Speaker 1>street people were locked and barricaded</v>

1582
01:18:25.461 --> 01:18:28.170
<v Speaker 1>into the big department stores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

1583
01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:30.680
<v Speaker 1>a pop singer called polymers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1584
01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:33.320
<v Speaker 1>tweeted out his million followers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1585
01:18:33.321 --> 01:18:36.200
<v Speaker 1>there are shots are being fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the back room of the store,</v>

1586
01:18:36.201 --> 01:18:38.660
<v Speaker 1>h and m and this sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1587
01:18:38.661 --> 01:18:41.450
<v Speaker 1>other people claim that the truck had </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone down.</v>

1588
01:18:41.451 --> 01:18:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Oxford mowing people down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've seen bodies.</v>

1589
01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:46.250
<v Speaker 1>The police said it was a major terrorist</v>
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>

1590
01:18:46.251 --> 01:18:49.430
<v Speaker 1>They were on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the press were all,</v>

1591
01:18:49.431 --> 01:18:54.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running stories turned out nothing </v>

1592
01:18:54.431 --> 01:18:54.431
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happened.</v>

1593
01:18:54.431 --> 01:18:58.721
<v Speaker 1>The next day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two men handled themselves into a local </v>

1594
01:18:58.721 --> 01:19:00.881
<v Speaker 1>police station saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought they might have been </v>

1595
01:19:00.881 --> 01:19:03.311
<v Speaker 1>responsible for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they will let off without any </v>

1596
01:19:03.311 --> 01:19:03.311
<v Speaker 1>charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is</v>

1597
01:19:03.311 --> 01:19:05.170
<v Speaker 2>they thought they might be responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it because they had been in an,</v>

1598
01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.800
<v Speaker 1>they'd had an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they,</v>

1599
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:08.610
<v Speaker 1>they weren't saying we're responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

1600
01:19:08.611 --> 01:19:13.080
<v Speaker 1>but like do they ask asking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and they will let go.</v>

1601
01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:15.520
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that is that we,</v>

1602
01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:18.750
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can simultaneously say we will not be</v>

1603
01:19:18.751 --> 01:19:23.640
<v Speaker 1>cowed and also actually be at the stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>where if you just hear a bang,</v>

1604
01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.320
<v Speaker 1>everyone goes running</v>

1605
01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:30.780
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be the last person to </v>

1606
01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:30.780
<v Speaker 2>figure out what's going on.</v>

1607
01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1608
01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.290
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as something you think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

1609
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:39.010
<v Speaker 2>people in this day and age when there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just this recent history of horrible </v>

1610
01:19:39.010 --> 01:19:41.360
<v Speaker 2>things happening over and over again in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Orlando here,</v>

1611
01:19:41.361 --> 01:19:46.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's just so many of them that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just instantaneously want to </v>

1612
01:19:46.361 --> 01:19:48.110
<v Speaker 2>react and then liking the vegas </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting.</v>

1613
01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:53.320
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>confusing about the vegas shooting is </v>

1614
01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:56.981
<v Speaker 2>people would go into casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would flee from the concert into </v>

1615
01:19:56.981 --> 01:20:00.670
<v Speaker 2>casinos and then talk about a shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then people would say there's an </v>

1616
01:20:00.670 --> 01:20:02.340
<v Speaker 2>active shooter at the Tropicana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an active choice.</v>

1617
01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:05.210
<v Speaker 1>That's why I never believed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate aftermath.</v>

1618
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:08.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a claim of other other shooters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always a claim or something that</v>

1619
01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:09.370
<v Speaker 1>turns out not okay.</v>

1620
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were claiming your shooters all </v>

1621
01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:16.641
<v Speaker 2>over the city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was no actual shooting in </v>

1622
01:20:16.641 --> 01:20:18.210
<v Speaker 2>these other casinos who just reports of </v>
<v Speaker 2>active shooter.</v>

1623
01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

1624
01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:25.780
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fascinating thing about why </v>

1625
01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:29.150
<v Speaker 1>this happens and I read a book some </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago about bloody Sunday,</v>

1626
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:34.390
<v Speaker 1>terrible event in Northern Ireland in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1972 and one of the things I went </v>

1627
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:39.341
<v Speaker 1>through all the tests that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who has seen one of the most </v>

1628
01:20:39.341 --> 01:20:40.160
<v Speaker 1>interesting things was the number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people whose memories,</v>

1629
01:20:40.161 --> 01:20:45.161
<v Speaker 1>which is totally different from what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know actually happened and one of the </v>

1630
01:20:45.161 --> 01:20:47.120
<v Speaker 1>conclusions I came to is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book by Harvard professor,</v>

1631
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:50.480
<v Speaker 1>but the called the seven sins of memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

1632
01:20:50.481 --> 01:20:55.481
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened is after one very traumatic </v>

1633
01:20:55.481 --> 01:20:59.441
<v Speaker 1>event or have a terrible event where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are effectively in the situation </v>

1634
01:20:59.441 --> 01:20:59.810
<v Speaker 1>of a war zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were just shopping.</v>

1635
01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:05.140
<v Speaker 1>The constantly moment before is that our</v>
<v Speaker 1>memories immediately become even more </v>

1636
01:21:05.571 --> 01:21:07.100
<v Speaker 1>suggestible than they are already.</v>

1637
01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:12.850
<v Speaker 1>And the most obvious thing of </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggestibility in these situations is </v>

1638
01:21:12.850 --> 01:21:16.810
<v Speaker 1>that the situation was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was worse around you and you came off </v>

1639
01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:19.760
<v Speaker 1>better than you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's almost always the case.</v>

1640
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1641
01:21:21.090 --> 01:21:22.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shots that were quite,</v>

1642
01:21:22.221 --> 01:21:23.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit away,</v>

1643
01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.640
<v Speaker 1>we're very close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1644
01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:27.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1645
01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.300
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your memory without knowing it,</v>

1646
01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our memory tells us we behave better </v>

1647
01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:38.560
<v Speaker 1>than we did and the threat was worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is our,</v>

1648
01:21:38.690 --> 01:21:42.090
<v Speaker 1>one of our ways of coping I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1649
01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:44.720
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a terrible thing.</v>

1650
01:21:44.721 --> 01:21:49.721
<v Speaker 1>And obviously with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean with these school shootings and </v>

1651
01:21:49.721 --> 01:21:49.721
<v Speaker 1>things that are going on here at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

1652
01:21:49.721 --> 01:21:53.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is obviously one of the things I </v>

1653
01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:54.210
<v Speaker 1>watched your podcast the other day where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were discussing it.</v>

1654
01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:56.930
<v Speaker 1>So the latest one with the Florida and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1655
01:21:57.710 --> 01:22:02.710
<v Speaker 1>and I think sort of in a way bafflement </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in this society about this is </v>

1656
01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:03.320
<v Speaker 1>understandable.</v>

1657
01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1658
01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:10.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the unimaginable horror of being </v>

1659
01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:13.581
<v Speaker 2>involved in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mind is just not prepared to cope </v>

1660
01:22:13.581 --> 01:22:13.581
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1661
01:22:13.581 --> 01:22:17.031
<v Speaker 2>maybe if you're a soldier and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced combat and you know how to </v>

1662
01:22:17.031 --> 01:22:19.050
<v Speaker 2>stay calm and a firefight because you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been in a bunch of them,</v>

1663
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:24.590
<v Speaker 2>but for the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's one of the reasons why I </v>

1664
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:28.041
<v Speaker 2>witness testimonies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the worst pieces of evidence you </v>

1665
01:22:28.041 --> 01:22:28.041
<v Speaker 2>could ever get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including I mean,</v>

1666
01:22:28.041 --> 01:22:32.750
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about basically everything about fist </v>

1667
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.750
<v Speaker 2>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1668
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1669
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have examples in our lives.</v>

1670
01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:36.680
<v Speaker 1>I've seen friends who've been through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>

1671
01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.720
<v Speaker 1>We know that they burned through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing and yet they have two totally</v>

1672
01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:41.130
<v Speaker 1>different directions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1673
01:22:41.150 --> 01:22:43.260
<v Speaker 1>you know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

1674
01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:46.850
<v Speaker 1>that's a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now you have this thing here where,</v>

1675
01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean in some ways even worse than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do have of the search to notch it up for</v>

1676
01:22:52.111 --> 01:22:54.690
<v Speaker 1>your own political science or against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the enemy.</v>

1677
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:56.970
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing with a twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the twitter point,</v>

1678
01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:58.560
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

1679
01:22:58.710 --> 01:23:03.540
<v Speaker 1>this obscene glee that goes on after any</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist attack in Europe,</v>

1680
01:23:03.541 --> 01:23:08.541
<v Speaker 1>but I think also here's what the attempt</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to immediately call it for the other </v>

1681
01:23:08.541 --> 01:23:13.021
<v Speaker 1>side or for your site or whatever and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to use terrible events as a way </v>

1682
01:23:14.651 --> 01:23:18.760
<v Speaker 1>to justify whatever your team is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1683
01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:24.570
<v Speaker 1>I have I find is amazing with the gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate here and I would find it amazing </v>

1684
01:23:24.570 --> 01:23:29.160
<v Speaker 1>coming from a different society on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the wages are not set up for one </v>

1685
01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.750
<v Speaker 1>side or the other in it and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a real</v>

1686
01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:37.780
<v Speaker 2>problem on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been watching a lot of it from the </v>

1687
01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:40.501
<v Speaker 2>perspective of the gun owners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>NRA members and the people that want to </v>

1688
01:23:41.651 --> 01:23:46.651
<v Speaker 2>defend the idea of having guns even of </v>
<v Speaker 2>arming teachers and you're looking at </v>

1689
01:23:47.711 --> 01:23:52.711
<v Speaker 2>their perspective on it and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective on it is all about their </v>

1690
01:23:52.711 --> 01:23:52.780
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All about the constitution,</v>

1691
01:23:52.781 --> 01:23:57.781
<v Speaker 2>all about the bill of rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all about protecting the second </v>

1692
01:23:57.781 --> 01:24:00.661
<v Speaker 2>amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all about gun ownership being taken </v>

1693
01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:00.661
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun ownership,</v>

1694
01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:01.810
<v Speaker 2>under attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the NRA under attack.</v>

1695
01:24:01.811 --> 01:24:05.680
<v Speaker 2>They're coming after our guns and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is this constant battle of ideas.</v>

1696
01:24:05.681 --> 01:24:08.920
<v Speaker 2>It's on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not addressing the actual issue.</v>

1697
01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1698
01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:11.740
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to.</v>

1699
01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:16.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arming teachers.</v>

1700
01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

1701
01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is Samuel Jackson had a great quote</v>

1702
01:24:19.881 --> 01:24:22.000
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1703
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:23.750
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he put it on twitter.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like someone tell a motherfucker was </v>
<v Speaker 2>never been in a gunfight.</v>

1705
01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:29.900
<v Speaker 2>The problems of arming a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>teachers,</v>

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:35.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Giving teachers guns as quitting.</v>

1716
01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:53.930
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world we're living in and he just </v>

1717
01:24:53.930 --> 01:24:53.930
<v Speaker 2>checked the number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like,</v>

1718
01:24:53.930 --> 01:24:53.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got three tweets.</v>

1719
01:24:53.930 --> 01:24:55.320
<v Speaker 2>It can't be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody likes.</v>

1720
01:24:55.321 --> 01:24:55.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1721
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1722
01:24:56.570 --> 01:25:01.570
<v Speaker 1>I felt that was a very pertinent one a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few years ago in New York on fifth when </v>

1723
01:25:01.570 --> 01:25:06.370
<v Speaker 1>somebody shot their colleague and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the office,</v>

1724
01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:10.210
<v Speaker 1>came back with a disgruntled worker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Carnegie and uh,</v>

1725
01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.930
<v Speaker 1>locally there were some policemen around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corner and they came out and started</v>

1726
01:25:13.931 --> 01:25:18.931
<v Speaker 1>firing at the guy who'd done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up wounding around 11 pedestrian </v>

1727
01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:19.540
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1728
01:25:19.541 --> 01:25:20.530
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you?</v>

1729
01:25:20.531 --> 01:25:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1730
01:25:21.431 --> 01:25:22.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have,</v>

1731
01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.840
<v Speaker 1>we have our own problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean this is a big problem for </v>

1732
01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.030
<v Speaker 1>America and what I can have more guns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have people.</v>

1733
01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely understand why the </v>

1734
01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:37.441
<v Speaker 1>amendment exists and I think it's a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>good idea for the time and I think it's </v>

1735
01:25:38.561 --> 01:25:40.510
<v Speaker 1>a very understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did hold onto it now,</v>

1736
01:25:40.570 --> 01:25:42.190
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1737
01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:44.800
<v Speaker 1>but why can't people say for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1738
01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.140
<v Speaker 1>we all have abstract ideas we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold onto,</v>

1739
01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:52.141
<v Speaker 1>but we were all in our countries have </v>
<v Speaker 1>like weird things that other people </v>

1740
01:25:52.141 --> 01:25:52.141
<v Speaker 1>don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1741
01:25:52.141 --> 01:25:56.370
<v Speaker 1>you might think it's odd to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hereditary constitutional monarch for </v>

1742
01:25:56.370 --> 01:25:56.370
<v Speaker 1>instance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1743
01:25:56.370 --> 01:25:56.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1744
01:25:56.770 --> 01:25:58.430
<v Speaker 1>it is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great way to put it.</v>

1745
01:25:58.490 --> 01:26:01.540
<v Speaker 1>It didn't seem strange and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were starting from now,</v>

1746
01:26:01.541 --> 01:26:03.280
<v Speaker 1>you might not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1747
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:04.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1748
01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.280
<v Speaker 1>but clearly with the ownership thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

1749
01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:12.850
<v Speaker 1>we are willing to take bad things </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening quite often because we want to</v>

1750
01:26:14.301 --> 01:26:15.050
<v Speaker 1>hold onto</v>

1751
01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:16.760
<v Speaker 2>the second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1752
01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.260
<v Speaker 2>the second amendment has been around </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

1753
01:26:18.261 --> 01:26:21.620
<v Speaker 2>The bad things happening quite often is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really from columbine on.</v>

1754
01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a few of them before the,</v>

1755
01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:25.220
<v Speaker 2>there was the Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas,</v>

1756
01:26:25.221 --> 01:26:26.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1757
01:26:26.150 --> 01:26:27.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tower shootings.</v>

1758
01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:28.670
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1759
01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:30.950
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just,</v>

1760
01:26:30.951 --> 01:26:33.460
<v Speaker 1>it's such an obvious point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sound like it was high.</v>

1761
01:26:33.490 --> 01:26:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not a Brit who's saying something </v>
<v Speaker 1>about America that's not at all </v>

1762
01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:39.500
<v Speaker 1>welcomed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems obvious that you just,</v>

1763
01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:44.980
<v Speaker 1>you could do a lot more damage with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>semiautomatic rifle than you can with a </v>

1764
01:26:45.411 --> 01:26:47.780
<v Speaker 1>knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most people,</v>

1765
01:26:47.781 --> 01:26:52.781
<v Speaker 1>we see this in the terrorism as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there are really committed </v>

1766
01:26:52.781 --> 01:26:55.520
<v Speaker 1>terrorists who don't commit acts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence unless they can get hold of,</v>

1767
01:26:55.521 --> 01:26:55.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1768
01:26:55.990 --> 01:27:00.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the means to do it because we often </v>

1769
01:27:00.990 --> 01:27:00.990
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1770
01:27:00.990 --> 01:27:00.990
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just like go out with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>knife?</v>

1771
01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Some people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people actually want to go out </v>

1772
01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:07.130
<v Speaker 1>in that way and what they see as being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>blaze of glory.</v>

1773
01:27:07.450 --> 01:27:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they like stopping them.</v>

1774
01:27:11.511 --> 01:27:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Having the means of getting that very </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>

1775
01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Seems to me very obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't to say that.</v>

1776
01:27:17.451 --> 01:27:22.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I think you made a point the </v>

1777
01:27:22.451 --> 01:27:23.831
<v Speaker 1>other day and it's like saying if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say everyone who has a gun is part of </v>

1778
01:27:23.831 --> 01:27:27.270
<v Speaker 1>promise and obviously not because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like saying everyone who's got a truck </v>

1779
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.270
<v Speaker 1>is about the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is,</v>

1780
01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:32.340
<v Speaker 1>there are obviously two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the psychological and whatever </v>

1781
01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:33.190
<v Speaker 1>the social issues are that caused this </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep happening and that,</v>

1782
01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.830
<v Speaker 1>that is obviously very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important to try to get to the root</v>

1783
01:27:36.831 --> 01:27:41.831
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can get to the root of that or </v>

1784
01:27:41.831 --> 01:27:45.071
<v Speaker 1>try to get through to that and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that people having access to </v>

1785
01:27:45.071 --> 01:27:49.901
<v Speaker 1>some of the weapons they have access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country must be a part of the </v>

1786
01:27:49.901 --> 01:27:50.170
<v Speaker 1>problem problem</v>

1787
01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:57.030
<v Speaker 2>it has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're also the idea that you </v>

1788
01:27:58.211 --> 01:28:03.211
<v Speaker 2>should just be able to go out and buy a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gun without really understanding how a </v>

1789
01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:04.000
<v Speaker 2>gun works at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1790
01:28:04.150 --> 01:28:08.290
<v Speaker 2>And which is exactly how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my first handgun license in 1994.</v>

1791
01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:11.890
<v Speaker 2>That's when I bought my first hand gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just went and bought a handgun.</v>

1792
01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:13.960
<v Speaker 2>But I did a background check on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1793
01:28:14.130 --> 01:28:16.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean I went to the range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They showed me what the safety is,</v>

1794
01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:18.670
<v Speaker 2>pointed this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the earphones on,</v>

1795
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:20.470
<v Speaker 2>make sure you don't blow yours out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

1796
01:28:20.471 --> 01:28:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>

1797
01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:22.900
<v Speaker 2>And then you leave the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1798
01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.420
<v Speaker 2>once your background checks clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find out you're not a criminal.</v>

1799
01:28:25.421 --> 01:28:27.880
<v Speaker 2>There's not much to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>

1800
01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:32.920
<v Speaker 2>There's a giant problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to drive an automobile,</v>

1801
01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:35.350
<v Speaker 2>you have to show that you understand the</v>
<v Speaker 2>laws.</v>

1802
01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:40.620
<v Speaker 2>You have to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to sit with an expert was to </v>

1803
01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:41.890
<v Speaker 2>sit there and driving instructor to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go through it with you.</v>

1804
01:28:41.891 --> 01:28:45.150
<v Speaker 2>They have to watch your movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to watch you make turns.</v>

1805
01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:50.170
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you imagine that it would be a </v>

1806
01:28:50.170 --> 01:28:53.791
<v Speaker 2>good idea to have some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical evaluation of a person that's </v>

1807
01:28:53.791 --> 01:28:55.840
<v Speaker 2>gonna going to buy a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's another thing.</v>

1808
01:28:55.841 --> 01:29:00.220
<v Speaker 2>There was an article recently that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying contrary to popular belief,</v>

1809
01:29:00.221 --> 01:29:03.810
<v Speaker 2>most school shootings not committed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are mentally ill will.</v>

1810
01:29:03.811 --> 01:29:06.210
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking stupid thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

1811
01:29:06.330 --> 01:29:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're committing a school shooting,</v>

1812
01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.920
<v Speaker 2>you're mentally ill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1813
01:29:10.921 --> 01:29:12.960
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then on top of that,</v>

1814
01:29:13.290 --> 01:29:16.410
<v Speaker 2>what they're ignoring conveniently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is another headline thing,</v>

1815
01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:22.040
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric medications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are almost entirely on some</v>

1816
01:29:23.131 --> 01:29:28.080
<v Speaker 2>form of psychiatric medication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it is anti anxiety pills,</v>

1817
01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:30.780
<v Speaker 2>whether it's antidepressants with there </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are all.</v>

1818
01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that correlation equals </v>
<v Speaker 2>causation.</v>

1819
01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:36.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to say that they're not.</v>

1820
01:29:36.991 --> 01:29:39.550
<v Speaker 2>This is just a bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is click bait headlines.</v>

1821
01:29:39.810 --> 01:29:41.460
<v Speaker 2>They're mentally ill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent,</v>

1822
01:29:41.490 --> 01:29:42.960
<v Speaker 2>100 percent of them are mentally ill</v>

1823
01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:47.270
<v Speaker 1>as a conservative commentator in the UK </v>
<v Speaker 1>called Peter Hitchens,</v>

1824
01:29:47.271 --> 01:29:51.530
<v Speaker 1>who always makes a point after Islamist </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist attacks in Europe that there's</v>

1825
01:29:51.531 --> 01:29:55.820
<v Speaker 1>a large number of them as well as other </v>
<v Speaker 1>types of attack who seemed to be on some</v>

1826
01:29:55.821 --> 01:29:58.910
<v Speaker 1>kind of medication and my point is </v>
<v Speaker 1>always I'm very,</v>

1827
01:29:58.911 --> 01:30:03.911
<v Speaker 1>very happy to have that conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to have that </v>

1828
01:30:03.911 --> 01:30:05.120
<v Speaker 1>conversation and we also have to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other parts of it as well.</v>

1829
01:30:05.210 --> 01:30:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's the same here.</v>

1830
01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I can't see why we can't have all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1831
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:11.910
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing that we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about earlier.</v>

1832
01:30:11.911 --> 01:30:16.911
<v Speaker 2>It's this idea of sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These wars people don't want to give up </v>

1833
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:22.310
<v Speaker 2>their idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to give up any ground </v>

1834
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.310
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever on their second amendment </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

1835
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's owning a 50 caliber fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>tank gun or whether it's having a gun </v>

1836
01:30:28.921 --> 01:30:33.921
<v Speaker 2>for home safety or for hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to give up anything and </v>

1837
01:30:33.921 --> 01:30:36.030
<v Speaker 2>they feel like it's a slippery slope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that I follow online that are</v>

1838
01:30:36.031 --> 01:30:41.031
<v Speaker 2>tweeting about this on a regular basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can go to a lot of them like </v>

1839
01:30:41.031 --> 01:30:45.110
<v Speaker 2>they're making videos about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dana Lash and Collin is actually,</v>

1840
01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.900
<v Speaker 2>his name is collins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cole Lion,</v>

1841
01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:50.870
<v Speaker 2>colion noir and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1842
01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very,</v>

1843
01:30:52.741 --> 01:30:53.820
<v Speaker 2>very vocal about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1844
01:30:53.821 --> 01:30:58.821
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like all anyone's taking into </v>

1845
01:30:58.821 --> 01:31:01.671
<v Speaker 2>account is that this idea that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming after your rights and and </v>

1846
01:31:01.671 --> 01:31:06.230
<v Speaker 2>emphasizing the idea of a good person </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a gun that can protect people in </v>

1847
01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:09.330
<v Speaker 2>these terrible situations which can </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen as well,</v>

1848
01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:12.720
<v Speaker 2>but what we have to address it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what we're talking about.</v>

1849
01:31:12.721 --> 01:31:16.320
<v Speaker 2>We have to address how the fuck do these</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy people get guns?</v>

1850
01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are so many people on mental health </v>

1851
01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:21.920
<v Speaker 2>medication?</v>

1852
01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge,</v>

1853
01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:25.960
<v Speaker 1>a huge fund and we always have one thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have the conversation about it,</v>

1854
01:31:25.961 --> 01:31:28.340
<v Speaker 1>but there's very little done on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>

1855
01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:32.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm very struck by this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have in all our countries,</v>

1856
01:31:32.021 --> 01:31:35.680
<v Speaker 1>I slipped into a very weird attitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards this type of medical.</v>

1857
01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1858
01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:41.520
<v Speaker 2>Very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very just very accepting of something </v>

1859
01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:43.080
<v Speaker 2>that radically alters the way your mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>works</v>

1860
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:48.050
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's maybe it's not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive.</v>

1861
01:31:48.051 --> 01:31:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Drug companies obviously don't have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive quite the opposite and to look</v>

1862
01:31:51.471 --> 01:31:56.471
<v Speaker 1>into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's another example of the set of </v>

1863
01:31:56.471 --> 01:31:58.910
<v Speaker 1>set of things we should be thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about at the moment,</v>

1864
01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:01.960
<v Speaker 1>looking at which we just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we,</v>

1865
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:05.530
<v Speaker 1>because it's sort of shut down because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we shut it down ourselves.</v>

1866
01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1867
01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just a such a range of </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

1868
01:32:10.121 --> 01:32:12.850
<v Speaker 1>This is the case with and it's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>

1869
01:32:13.090 --> 01:32:17.470
<v Speaker 1>It's always that if you address the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question difficult as it might be,</v>

1870
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:20.770
<v Speaker 1>you are attacking an individual who </v>
<v Speaker 1>might suffer from it,</v>

1871
01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:23.710
<v Speaker 1>who might be upset by US addressing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

1872
01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of suspicions about all </v>

1873
01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:30.290
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very skeptical person.</v>

1874
01:32:30.291 --> 01:32:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Is it worried about things that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>told.</v>

1875
01:32:31.541 --> 01:32:33.180
<v Speaker 1>So I'd like to look into things.</v>

1876
01:32:33.450 --> 01:32:38.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm amazed at the number of things in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our societies that we just don't </v>

1877
01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:40.600
<v Speaker 1>discuss net all the things that we ought</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be discussing.</v>

1878
01:32:41.230 --> 01:32:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues like mental health issues,</v>

1879
01:32:44.370 --> 01:32:49.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues that have to do with a social </v>

1880
01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:51.601
<v Speaker 1>presumptions that are going on left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and center at the moment where </v>

1881
01:32:51.601 --> 01:32:53.380
<v Speaker 1>you're not meant to discuss things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have popped into me.</v>

1882
01:32:53.381 --> 01:32:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting and very important.</v>

1883
01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just see it everywhere.</v>

1884
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might,</v>

1885
01:33:01.841 --> 01:33:06.841
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is a slightly strange segue to </v>

1886
01:33:06.841 --> 01:33:08.791
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a fascinating one in in </v>

1887
01:33:08.791 --> 01:33:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Britain a couple of days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slightly lighter subject,</v>

1888
01:33:11.321 --> 01:33:13.450
<v Speaker 1>but there was not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1889
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:18.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a dive in the UK called Tom </v>

1890
01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Daley who married a screenwriter from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood called Dustin Lance black.</v>

1891
01:33:20.650 --> 01:33:25.650
<v Speaker 1>And it was announced a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago on Valentine's Day that they were </v>

1892
01:33:25.650 --> 01:33:27.820
<v Speaker 1>having a baby and there was a photograph</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them holding a scan.</v>

1893
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:33.030
<v Speaker 1>They sent out on their twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two men who are married who have </v>

1894
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:37.440
<v Speaker 1>ultrasound scan and all of the papers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the BBC and evidence report is </v>

1895
01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:41.371
<v Speaker 1>saying Dustin and Tom are having a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

1896
01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm gay and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm homophobic,</v>

1897
01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:50.520
<v Speaker 1>but I looked at this as how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how like someone else involved.</v>

1898
01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a joke,</v>

1899
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:54.200
<v Speaker 1>gays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1900
01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:56.410
<v Speaker 1>you can't have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean we can't keep trying,</v>

1901
01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:02.340
<v Speaker 1>but I just loaded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing in the articles about </v>

1902
01:34:02.651 --> 01:34:05.080
<v Speaker 1>this tells me anything I would like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1903
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:10.910
<v Speaker 1>like I know that they didn't just have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>role around and woke up in the morning </v>

1904
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:10.910
<v Speaker 1>and one of them was [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

1905
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:15.460
<v Speaker 1>And I know that there has to be a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved at some point we know this,</v>

1906
01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:20.500
<v Speaker 1>but we are meant to just adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1907
01:34:20.501 --> 01:34:21.280
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1908
01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:25.750
<v Speaker 1>And it's almost as if it's set up so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that somebody says,</v>

1909
01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:27.780
<v Speaker 1>wait a isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>

1910
01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:29.920
<v Speaker 1>isn't a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a uterus,</v>

1911
01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:34.520
<v Speaker 1>so that they're no longer is a big word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1912
01:34:35.770 --> 01:34:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>

1913
01:34:36.850 --> 01:34:38.150
<v Speaker 1>xenophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1914
01:34:38.170 --> 01:34:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Everything we've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1915
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:43.470
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course somebody did really well.</v>

1916
01:34:43.570 --> 01:34:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Somebody from the Daily Mail wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 1>column saying,</v>

1917
01:34:46.091 --> 01:34:48.610
<v Speaker 1>come on to dads isn't a new normal sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

1918
01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.620
<v Speaker 1>And of course then everyone piled in on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1919
01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:53.170
<v Speaker 1>And although he always advertises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrew their advertising.</v>

1920
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:59.270
<v Speaker 1>But this was just on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was like literally literally until </v>

1921
01:34:59.270 --> 01:35:02.050
<v Speaker 1>the day before yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was possible to say I didn't think </v>

1922
01:35:02.050 --> 01:35:04.220
<v Speaker 1>two guys can just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have sex and make a tiled.</v>

1923
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Literally that was okay until the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>before yesterday.</v>

1924
01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:10.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's not okay today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what will not be okay tomorrow?</v>

1925
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:12.830
<v Speaker 1>And I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1926
01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:13.860
<v Speaker 1>and I wrote about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1927
01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:15.830
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1928
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:17.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe a couple other people ended up </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it too.</v>

1929
01:35:17.781 --> 01:35:21.730
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of these answers.</v>

1930
01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1931
01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:28.720
<v Speaker 1>that you are the things that seem very </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious to us are all the things you're </v>

1932
01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:33.581
<v Speaker 1>not meant to write about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost as if they're like booby traps </v>

1933
01:35:33.581 --> 01:35:34.790
<v Speaker 1>where you need to go off and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just think,</v>

1934
01:35:34.791 --> 01:35:39.500
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't more people pile on in because</v>

1935
01:35:39.501 --> 01:35:44.501
<v Speaker 1>we could have a heck of a time and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>might solve.</v>

1936
01:35:45.650 --> 01:35:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't want to pile in on anything</v>

1937
01:35:47.511 --> 01:35:51.920
<v Speaker 2>revolving involving gender or sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too scary.</v>

1938
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:56.740
<v Speaker 2>It's landmine field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can walk in,</v>

1939
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:59.210
<v Speaker 2>especially as you said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people with regular jobs,</v>

1940
01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:04.600
<v Speaker 2>if you get called out for being a racist</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a homophobe or anything along those </v>

1941
01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:04.750
<v Speaker 2>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doomed.</v>

1942
01:36:04.930 --> 01:36:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1943
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:07.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1944
01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:12.220
<v Speaker 1>But in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who does have a voice as a </v>

1945
01:36:12.401 --> 01:36:13.960
<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a speaker,</v>

1946
01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:15.250
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broadcaster,</v>

1947
01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:18.580
<v Speaker 1>I think has a disproportionate duty to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do so.</v>

1948
01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:21.250
<v Speaker 1>To do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1949
01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:25.150
<v Speaker 1>there's no point in just repeating those</v>
<v Speaker 1>same new lies,</v>

1950
01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:30.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disproportion of duty to try to </v>

1951
01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:33.151
<v Speaker 1>break them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember one of my favorite quotes </v>

1952
01:36:33.151 --> 01:36:33.151
<v Speaker 1>that went from her mencken who says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1953
01:36:33.151 --> 01:36:35.080
<v Speaker 1>that history was always progressed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>jolly fellows,</v>

1954
01:36:35.110 --> 01:36:40.110
<v Speaker 1>heaving dead cats into sanctuaries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>going roy string down the highways of </v>

1955
01:36:40.110 --> 01:36:41.890
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1956
01:36:41.891 --> 01:36:42.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1957
01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:43.620
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1958
01:36:43.630 --> 01:36:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish that there were more dead cat </v>

1959
01:36:48.630 --> 01:36:51.120
<v Speaker 1>lovers because he's such a bad job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a living sometimes and um,</v>

1960
01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:55.800
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1961
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:58.190
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the only things worth doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1962
01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:01.870
<v Speaker 1>if we're all going to be told lies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we expect you to go along with them,</v>

1963
01:37:01.871 --> 01:37:06.871
<v Speaker 1>whether it's about terrorism or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or gay parenting or mental health or </v>

1964
01:37:07.381 --> 01:37:08.860
<v Speaker 1>anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole set of them.</v>

1965
01:37:08.861 --> 01:37:11.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a really target rich environment.</v>

1966
01:37:11.770 --> 01:37:16.770
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's more people doing </v>

1967
01:37:16.770 --> 01:37:19.021
<v Speaker 2>that now than ever before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's more people like you and I who </v>

1968
01:37:19.021 --> 01:37:20.460
<v Speaker 2>can kind of get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1969
01:37:20.530 --> 01:37:21.030
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1970
01:37:21.031 --> 01:37:22.410
<v Speaker 2>why do you think you'd get away with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way?</v>

1971
01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he can't take me seriously.</v>

1972
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm a cage fighting commentator and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dirty comedian.</v>

1973
01:37:29.330 --> 01:37:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's listening to me and take me </v>

1974
01:37:34.330 --> 01:37:35.500
<v Speaker 2>seriously in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Book sort of.</v>

1975
01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:39.040
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

1976
01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:43.090

<v Speaker 2>I'm a kind person.</v>

1977
01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I think that helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not a mean person,</v>

1978
01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:51.110
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things I'm saying these things </v>

1979
01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:51.110
<v Speaker 2>from I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1980
01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:51.970
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1981
01:37:52.090 --> 01:37:55.380
<v Speaker 2>here's one that I thought was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating and this is one of the great</v>

1982
01:37:55.381 --> 01:37:59.730
<v Speaker 2>example of how strange we get on </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjects.</v>

1983
01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caitlyn Jenner,</v>

1984
01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:03.870
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Caitlyn Jenner transitioned,</v>

1985
01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:07.710
<v Speaker 2>that was the primary thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about.</v>

1986
01:38:07.711 --> 01:38:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a woman now and it was right after</v>

1987
01:38:10.591 --> 01:38:13.710
<v Speaker 2>she had been spacing out behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheel,</v>

1988
01:38:13.810 --> 01:38:18.810
<v Speaker 2>slammed into a woman and pushed her into</v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic and a head on collision and the </v>

1989
01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:22.431
<v Speaker 2>woman died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was almost just completely </v>

1990
01:38:22.431 --> 01:38:22.431
<v Speaker 2>forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Completely forgot.</v>

1991
01:38:22.770 --> 01:38:25.950
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't believe in gay marriage.</v>

1992
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1994
01:38:28.991 --> 01:38:32.470

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1995
01:38:32.471 --> 01:38:35.590
<v Speaker 2>you could not have a more wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>spokesperson.</v>

1996
01:38:35.591 --> 01:38:40.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2003
01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:57.050
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's back to that thing about the.</v>

2004
01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Almost as if you're being dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2005
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:01.820
<v Speaker 1>You're there to discuss it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I said this to Sam Harris,</v>

2006
01:39:01.821 --> 01:39:06.821
<v Speaker 1>I got him into trouble just on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast by saying this and he didn't </v>

2007
01:39:06.821 --> 01:39:10.811
<v Speaker 1>attack me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he got a whole load of </v>

2008
01:39:10.811 --> 01:39:10.811
<v Speaker 1>transphobia accusations because of me </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying something.</v>

2009
01:39:10.811 --> 01:39:13.550
<v Speaker 1>But I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought what was happening was that we</v>

2010
01:39:13.551 --> 01:39:18.551
<v Speaker 1>were being asked not only to agree that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caitlin Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn </v>

2011
01:39:18.551 --> 01:39:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Jenner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The caitlyn Jenner was a woman,</v>

2012
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:22.740
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to find out.</v>

2013
01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to say she's beautiful Shag and</v>

2014
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Jenna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were just like.</v>

2015
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:28.900
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I find those,</v>

2016
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:31.020
<v Speaker 1>those ones are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one of the other way.</v>

2017
01:39:31.230 --> 01:39:34.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit like the gave her anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like I dare you,</v>

2018
01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:36.530
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just tried pretending,</v>

2019
01:39:36.710 --> 01:39:39.830
<v Speaker 1>pretending that tolman dusting can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a baby.</v>

2020
01:39:40.150 --> 01:39:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2021
01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:42.920
<v Speaker 1>and it was the same with a little while </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

2022
01:39:42.921 --> 01:39:45.830
<v Speaker 1>there was a boy in Britain who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>iconic,</v>

2023
01:39:45.831 --> 01:39:47.700
<v Speaker 1>whether he wanted to turn up school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>address.</v>

2024
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:50.510
<v Speaker 1>He's like nine years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a route,</v>

2025
01:39:50.511 --> 01:39:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The school said yes or no,</v>

2026
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:57.950
<v Speaker 1>but it was a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it became like a weigh in on </v>

2027
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:57.950
<v Speaker 1>the behalf of the nine year old Trans </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kid.</v>

2028
01:39:57.950 --> 01:40:02.591
<v Speaker 1>I got lots of questions to ask that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it became a,</v>

2029
01:40:03.411 --> 01:40:04.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nine year old kid was,</v>

2030
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:06.050
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was uh,</v>

2031
01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:11.120
<v Speaker 1>became a model for a fashion shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>

2032
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:14.630
<v Speaker 1>find the nine year old boy who says he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a girl.</v>

2033
01:40:14.631 --> 01:40:19.631
<v Speaker 1>Attractive and say it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much more do you want to push </v>

2034
01:40:21.121 --> 01:40:22.590
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2035
01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:24.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were awarding.</v>

2036
01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:25.100
<v Speaker 1>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2037
01:40:25.710 --> 01:40:27.450
<v Speaker 1>isn't she lovely?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2038
01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:35.320
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing to us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you trying to make us agree to?</v>

2039
01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:37.580
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2040
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

2041
01:40:38.350 --> 01:40:41.280
<v Speaker 2>what's the cause of all this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you.</v>

2042
01:40:41.310 --> 01:40:43.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must've been talking about this,</v>

2043
01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:45.610
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is this bizarre,</v>

2044
01:40:45.611 --> 01:40:49.120
<v Speaker 2>illogical conversation that falls into </v>
<v Speaker 2>these very convenient,</v>

2045
01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:54.030
<v Speaker 2>well cut grooves that you're really not </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to slide ideas out</v>

2046
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:59.040
<v Speaker 1>of what's causing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a so many things I want is </v>

2047
01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:04.920
<v Speaker 1>one is that it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what happens when the economics </v>

2048
01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.520
<v Speaker 1>goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a feeling.</v>

2049
01:41:06.521 --> 01:41:09.630
<v Speaker 1>The economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean is that if people's,</v>

2050
01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:12.760
<v Speaker 1>if people aren't seeing it increases in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their living.</v>

2051
01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:14.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my generation,</v>

2052
01:41:14.650 --> 01:41:16.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm 38,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2053
01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:21.740
<v Speaker 1>by just above this generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the generations ever so slightly </v>

2054
01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:21.740
<v Speaker 1>below me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2055
01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:25.360
<v Speaker 1>is becoming aware that weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on the property ladder at all.</v>

2056
01:41:25.361 --> 01:41:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a property ladder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning owning a home,</v>

2057
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:31.450
<v Speaker 1>owning a home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that their parents generation</v>

2058
01:41:31.810 --> 01:41:34.090
<v Speaker 1>got not easily by any means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't,</v>

2059
01:41:34.091 --> 01:41:35.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't easy for boomers,</v>

2060
01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:37.390
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2061
01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:42.680
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that somehow they're going to have it </v>

2062
01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:43.030
<v Speaker 1>harder than their parents' generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2063
01:41:43.031 --> 01:41:46.120
<v Speaker 1>might not enjoy the living standards of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the parents' generation.</v>

2064
01:41:46.121 --> 01:41:51.121
<v Speaker 1>Enjoyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be certainly in western Europe </v>

2065
01:41:51.121 --> 01:41:51.340
<v Speaker 1>coming home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be occurring to them.</v>

2066
01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:55.450
<v Speaker 1>What do you do in those such situations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2067
01:41:55.570 --> 01:41:59.200
<v Speaker 1>you've got to have other things to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get worth from.</v>

2068
01:41:59.950 --> 01:42:04.950
<v Speaker 1>If for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to own a home until </v>

2069
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:05.770
<v Speaker 1>you're 40 and that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a woman at your career,</v>

2070
01:42:05.771 --> 01:42:10.771
<v Speaker 1>you need to have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't afford to take the time </v>

2071
01:42:10.771 --> 01:42:11.410
<v Speaker 1>off work and you might not be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start a family and then you're trying to</v>

2072
01:42:11.411 --> 01:42:13.750
<v Speaker 1>start a family in your forties and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>harder,</v>

2073
01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:18.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard and a whole set of other </v>

2074
01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:19.670
<v Speaker 1>things like that that are definitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>delayed for new generation.</v>

2075
01:42:19.671 --> 01:42:24.340
<v Speaker 1>And I think that it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying certainly it's possible.</v>

2076
01:42:24.341 --> 01:42:28.900
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that that generation </v>
<v Speaker 1>might discover new gods.</v>

2077
01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I might want to enforce the new rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>just as avidly as the old gods.</v>

2078
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:41.550
<v Speaker 1>And there is an element of that girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand why.</v>

2079
01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I talk about the things we </v>

2080
01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:50.170
<v Speaker 1>taught her say they would just </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuously be this very angry.</v>

2081
01:42:50.171 --> 01:42:51.720
<v Speaker 1>We actually not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

2082
01:42:51.721 --> 01:42:52.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought that.</v>

2083
01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I think probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2084
01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:59.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite hard to shock me or to upset </v>

2085
01:42:59.360 --> 01:42:59.360
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2086
01:42:59.360 --> 01:42:59.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can.</v>

2087
01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

2088
01:43:00.011 --> 01:43:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Or why do you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2089
01:43:01.850 --> 01:43:05.620
<v Speaker 1>so why do I always get this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we've got to stop him?</v>

2090
01:43:06.730 --> 01:43:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than that,</v>

2091
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:12.530
<v Speaker 1>these are new commandments were breaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2092
01:43:12.650 --> 01:43:17.650
<v Speaker 1>and why so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean they're all sort of </v>

2093
01:43:17.650 --> 01:43:17.650
<v Speaker 1>connected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't they?</v>

2094
01:43:17.650 --> 01:43:22.200
<v Speaker 1>These things they're all attempts to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all attempts to something </v>

2095
01:43:23.370 --> 01:43:26.560
<v Speaker 1>like purity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which disturbs me.</v>

2096
01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:32.140
<v Speaker 1>What sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we could just get everything in a </v>

2097
01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:32.140
<v Speaker 1>row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2098
01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:32.320
<v Speaker 1>you even hear that thing get in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>lane.</v>

2099
01:43:32.910 --> 01:43:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I hate the people who say that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all in your lane or do you think you are</v>

2100
01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:42.220
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's my lane?</v>

2101
01:43:42.250 --> 01:43:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I think I've said it a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2102
01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:45.270
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

2103
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:47.170
<v Speaker 1>but the only people that needed to stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their lane.</v>

2104
01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York Times.</v>

2105
01:43:49.421 --> 01:43:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading on the plane over.</v>

2106
01:43:50.821 --> 01:43:55.821
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm reading your time on the planet </v>

2107
01:43:55.821 --> 01:43:55.821
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a,</v>

2108
01:43:55.821 --> 01:43:55.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a question as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2109
01:43:56.010 --> 01:43:57.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w we call it,</v>

2110
01:43:57.591 --> 01:43:58.300
<v Speaker 1>what do you go south?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>

2111
01:43:58.310 --> 01:44:03.000
<v Speaker 1>whatever advice column this woman says </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was on the,</v>

2112
01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:08.260
<v Speaker 1>on the train covered days ago and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a man who came in with his </v>

2113
01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:11.711
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was being really abusive to her and </v>

2114
01:44:11.711 --> 01:44:11.711
<v Speaker 1>it just kept happening and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

2115
01:44:11.711 --> 01:44:13.820
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of nasty ball and violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

2116
01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:17.070
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other people in the case,</v>

2117
01:44:17.071 --> 01:44:19.910
<v Speaker 1>they will move away and of course you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can see what's coming.</v>

2118
01:44:19.911 --> 01:44:22.740
<v Speaker 1>The combination of it is she says she </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets off the train.</v>

2119
01:44:22.770 --> 01:44:24.410
<v Speaker 1>She wonders whether she should have said</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2120
01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:29.800
<v Speaker 1>but she says conscious of her white </v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege and that these people were </v>

2121
01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:33.410
<v Speaker 1>people of color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm reading this.</v>

2122
01:44:33.411 --> 01:44:38.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you you now now if you saw a man of</v>

2123
01:44:40.971 --> 01:44:44.960
<v Speaker 1>different skin pigmentation from you </v>
<v Speaker 1>abusing a woman,</v>

2124
01:44:44.961 --> 01:44:47.030
<v Speaker 1>have different skin pigmentation from </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2125
01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:49.430
<v Speaker 1>The right thing is not to defend the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

2126
01:44:49.610 --> 01:44:53.600
<v Speaker 1>That seems like just a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>justification for being a coward.</v>

2127
01:44:53.630 --> 01:44:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2128
01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:56.530
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I found the advice was yeah,</v>

2129
01:44:56.540 --> 01:45:01.540
<v Speaker 1>now you did the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should've spoken to an </v>

2130
01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:01.540
<v Speaker 1>official suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was no kind of.</v>

2131
01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:03.620
<v Speaker 1>So all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this weird get in your lane.</v>

2132
01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:04.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2133
01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:09.700
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a privileged way of your </v>

2134
01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:09.700
<v Speaker 1>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2135
01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:10.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way to make society have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous breakdown.</v>

2136
01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Is Way up your privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2137
01:45:12.650 --> 01:45:14.780
<v Speaker 1>privilege scorecards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my God,</v>

2138
01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2139
01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:17.980
<v Speaker 1>but all of these things seem to.</v>

2140
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:20.330
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if people think if we get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2141
01:45:21.010 --> 01:45:23.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lanes correct,</v>

2142
01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:29.080
<v Speaker 1>everything will be sorted and here's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is first of all the means of </v>

2143
01:45:30.861 --> 01:45:32.810
<v Speaker 1>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just hideous.</v>

2144
01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:36.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean hideous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They accentuate racial difference.</v>

2145
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:41.470
<v Speaker 1>They accentuates sexual and gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences and accentuate everything </v>

2146
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:44.561
<v Speaker 1>else and the destination is horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not the nirvana they think that </v>

2147
01:45:47.871 --> 01:45:52.280
<v Speaker 1>they're creating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a really good moment to,</v>

2148
01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:57.400
<v Speaker 1>to try to look at some of this and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about it and to think about as </v>

2149
01:45:57.561 --> 01:46:02.561
<v Speaker 1>widely and as freely as we can and yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet the effort is to do the </v>

2150
01:46:02.571 --> 01:46:07.571
<v Speaker 1>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're onto something with the </v>

2151
01:46:07.571 --> 01:46:10.181
<v Speaker 1>idea that this radical progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very restrictive line of communication </v>

2152
01:46:10.431 --> 01:46:15.110
<v Speaker 1>ideology that we're experiencing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about is coming from a lot</v>

2153
01:46:15.111 --> 01:46:17.240
<v Speaker 1>of people that don't have a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2154
01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:20.210
<v Speaker 1>there are atheists or they're at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very least agnostics,</v>

2155
01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:21.710
<v Speaker 1>modern progressives.</v>

2156
01:46:21.710 --> 01:46:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Very rarely religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2157
01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:27.950
<v Speaker 1>and this must be for somebody who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonbeliever like myself.</v>

2158
01:46:27.951 --> 01:46:30.110
<v Speaker 1>This is a painful thing to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

2159
01:46:30.490 --> 01:46:31.970
<v Speaker 1>you have to think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>

2160
01:46:31.971 --> 01:46:36.971
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that an interesting thing as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think of yourself as being </v>

2161
01:46:36.971 --> 01:46:37.900
<v Speaker 1>on a team with these other atheists or </v>
<v Speaker 1>agnostics,</v>

2162
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:38.660
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2163
01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:41.600
<v Speaker 1>but you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying as an atheist yourself,</v>

2164
01:46:41.601 --> 01:46:46.601
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've already lumped yourself In with </v>

2165
01:46:46.601 --> 01:46:46.601
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2166
01:46:46.601 --> 01:46:49.511
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I speaking to campus in with us for a </v>

2167
01:46:49.511 --> 01:46:49.950
<v Speaker 1>while ago and I spoke to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who's really,</v>

2168
01:46:49.951 --> 01:46:54.951
<v Speaker 1>really clever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skewed into as a free thinker and he </v>

2169
01:46:54.951 --> 01:46:56.170
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said to the officers,</v>

2170
01:46:56.171 --> 01:46:56.880
<v Speaker 1>you were talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2171
01:46:56.881 --> 01:47:01.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd have some hideous experience at a </v>

2172
01:47:01.881 --> 01:47:01.881
<v Speaker 1>local free thinkers society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2173
01:47:01.881 --> 01:47:02.130
<v Speaker 1>everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in your lane.</v>

2174
01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:08.240
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that being among free </v>

2175
01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:08.340
<v Speaker 1>thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the rest of it will be good.</v>

2176
01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:09.080
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2177
01:47:09.090 --> 01:47:09.390
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2178
01:47:09.391 --> 01:47:09.900
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2179
01:47:09.901 --> 01:47:13.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the free thinkers turn out to be just as</v>

2180
01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.770
<v Speaker 1>able to be blindfolded if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2181
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:17.050
<v Speaker 1>on certain things down</v>

2182
01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:22.900
<v Speaker 2>when you imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course self proclaimed free thinkers </v>

2183
01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:24.860
<v Speaker 2>would be even more inclined to adopt a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rigid ideology.</v>

2184
01:47:24.861 --> 01:47:27.490
<v Speaker 2>There are proclaiming themselves to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>free</v>

2185
01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:32.540
<v Speaker 1>thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's possible that this comes from </v>

2186
01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:32.540
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2187
01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:32.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2188
01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:33.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old joke about sentences,</v>

2189
01:47:33.691 --> 01:47:34.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2190
01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:39.030
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sensor knows everythIng that the </v>

2191
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:40.790
<v Speaker 1>people who are really into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2192
01:47:40.791 --> 01:47:45.791
<v Speaker 1>I spoke once to man who was on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>british board of film classification or </v>

2193
01:47:45.791 --> 01:47:47.130
<v Speaker 1>you said all day watching really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcore pornography,</v>

2194
01:47:47.131 --> 01:47:49.350
<v Speaker 1>deciding what can be legalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last thing,</v>

2195
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:51.900
<v Speaker 1>you must have a dark view of humanity.</v>

2196
01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what justice wasn't justice </v>

2197
01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:56.940
<v Speaker 2>scalia's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2198
01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:57.940
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to describe it,</v>

2199
01:47:57.941 --> 01:48:02.580
<v Speaker 2>but I'll know it when I see it exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why are you a fucking judge?</v>

2200
01:48:02.770 --> 01:48:07.770
<v Speaker 1>And it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it may be that these people that a </v>

2201
01:48:07.770 --> 01:48:11.221
<v Speaker 1>lot of conservatives have this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one becomes rigid about something </v>

2202
01:48:11.221 --> 01:48:15.130
<v Speaker 1>because you've seen into the abyss </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know.</v>

2203
01:48:15.131 --> 01:48:20.131
<v Speaker 1>You might behave in a certain very </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible way and so you,</v>

2204
01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:24.820
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to pull back from that chaos.</v>

2205
01:48:24.821 --> 01:48:26.560
<v Speaker 1>You want to pull other people back as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2206
01:48:27.190 --> 01:48:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Seems to me that a lot of circled free </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinker,</v>

2207
01:48:29.210 --> 01:48:34.120
<v Speaker 1>self designated free thing is may well </v>
<v Speaker 1>have these glimpses and may well think,</v>

2208
01:48:34.150 --> 01:48:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's holding this </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and therefore might precisely </v>

2209
01:48:40.151 --> 01:48:45.151
<v Speaker 1>for that reason be disproportionately </v>
<v Speaker 1>rigid on almost any new ideology that </v>

2210
01:48:45.461 --> 01:48:47.770
<v Speaker 1>came along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting lane.</v>

2211
01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2212
01:48:51.110 --> 01:48:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

2213
01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:55.450
<v Speaker 2>This idea that this is almost like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>substitution for religion.</v>

2214
01:48:55.451 --> 01:49:00.451
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like there's an inherent </v>
<v Speaker 2>need that we have because human beings </v>

2215
01:49:00.451 --> 01:49:03.700
<v Speaker 2>have operated under these patterns for </v>
<v Speaker 2>so long.</v>

2216
01:49:03.850 --> 01:49:06.230
<v Speaker 1>We clearly have this need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be upset.</v>

2217
01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Did pretend we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2218
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2219
01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:13.900
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because the more you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2220
01:49:14.050 --> 01:49:19.050
<v Speaker 2>we found ways to market and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways to market and I think that that's </v>

2221
01:49:19.050 --> 01:49:22.180
<v Speaker 2>important and that mockery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it seems trivial,</v>

2222
01:49:22.181 --> 01:49:26.260
<v Speaker 2>what it does do is let people know how </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous other people feel those ideas</v>

2223
01:49:26.261 --> 01:49:29.710
<v Speaker 2>are and then it makes them reexamined </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves because they don't like being</v>

2224
01:49:29.711 --> 01:49:34.210
<v Speaker 2>mocked the term social justice warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful for that because it just makes</v>

2225
01:49:34.211 --> 01:49:38.770
<v Speaker 2>you look like such a fucking fool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a social justice warrior.</v>

2226
01:49:39.390 --> 01:49:42.180
<v Speaker 1>It was a site that I was a colleague of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>

2227
01:49:42.181 --> 01:49:44.970
<v Speaker 1>a spectator in london called the rod </v>
<v Speaker 1>little road a few years ago.</v>

2228
01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Any any man who says he's a feminist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly just as seeking a shag.</v>

2229
01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2230
01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:52.050
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2231
01:49:53.190 --> 01:49:58.190
<v Speaker 3>One thing to want quality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to proudly state that you're a </v>

2232
01:49:58.190 --> 01:49:59.820
<v Speaker 3>feminist is it's almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have joked around about it like,</v>

2233
01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:02.550
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't run fast.</v>

2234
01:50:02.670 --> 01:50:07.670
<v Speaker 3>You can't pick things up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like the fuck somebody said </v>

2235
01:50:07.670 --> 01:50:08.210
<v Speaker 3>it's about a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end</v>

2236
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:09.410
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2237
01:50:09.411 --> 01:50:10.250
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2238
01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:15.300
<v Speaker 1>they described themselves as an anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist party and as a comedian who said </v>

2239
01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:17.450
<v Speaker 1>it actually makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you think they might be racist.</v>

2240
01:50:18.230 --> 01:50:22.360
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like saying your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ntp to affiliate children's agents.</v>

2241
01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:27.420
<v Speaker 3>See you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is the community that said that </v>

2242
01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:30.820
<v Speaker 3>doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

2243
01:50:30.850 --> 01:50:32.590
<v Speaker 3>That's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so true.</v>

2244
01:50:32.591 --> 01:50:34.930
<v Speaker 3>And so it's virtue signaling to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highest degree.</v>

2245
01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:37.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're putting up your flag of,</v>

2246
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:39.940
<v Speaker 3>of moral superiority standing on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>high ground.</v>

2247
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.780
<v Speaker 1>But it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

2248
01:50:40.781 --> 01:50:45.781
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it obviouslY means a great deal to talk </v>

2249
01:50:45.781 --> 01:50:45.781
<v Speaker 1>to these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2250
01:50:45.781 --> 01:50:48.800
<v Speaker 1>but then the question is just how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to invite them not to think like </v>

2251
01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:48.800
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2252
01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:52.360
<v Speaker 3>I think mockery mockeries one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best ways because it just lets them know</v>

2253
01:50:52.361 --> 01:50:53.980
<v Speaker 3>that other people think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>preposterous,</v>

2254
01:50:53.981 --> 01:50:56.290
<v Speaker 3>so it's not achieving the desired </v>
<v Speaker 3>result.</v>

2255
01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:58.480
<v Speaker 3>The desired result is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2256
01:50:58.481 --> 01:51:01.690
<v Speaker 3>look at this amazing person is </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible progressive ways of thinking.</v>

2257
01:51:01.930 --> 01:51:02.800
<v Speaker 3>Not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2258
01:51:02.801 --> 01:51:05.080
<v Speaker 3>look at this transparent fuck who's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get laid.</v>

2259
01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:08.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2260
01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:10.780
<v Speaker 3>that's how a lot of us see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't see that.</v>

2261
01:51:10.781 --> 01:51:12.700
<v Speaker 3>We see it that way in some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2262
01:51:13.090 --> 01:51:17.140
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of our behavior is a,</v>

2263
01:51:18.010 --> 01:51:20.170
<v Speaker 3>it's experimental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2264
01:51:20.171 --> 01:51:25.171
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are experimenting with various </v>

2265
01:51:25.171 --> 01:51:26.680
<v Speaker 3>different ways of gaining a social </v>
<v Speaker 3>preference points.</v>

2266
01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2267
01:51:27.860 --> 01:51:31.560
<v Speaker 1>this is why I always say even if even if</v>
<v Speaker 1>people aren't believers,</v>

2268
01:51:31.561 --> 01:51:34.290
<v Speaker 1>there were things that they can learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>from religion and from tradition.</v>

2269
01:51:35.670 --> 01:51:37.430
<v Speaker 1>And I've always thought that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2270
01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:43.040
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought there's one central </v>
<v Speaker 1>insight of the judeo christian </v>

2271
01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:46.940
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I wish that the social justice </v>

2272
01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:46.940
<v Speaker 1>warriors bore in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>

2273
01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:48.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the garden of eden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2274
01:51:49.130 --> 01:51:50.040
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

2275
01:51:50.110 --> 01:51:55.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the what we call the crooked timber of </v>

2276
01:51:55.110 --> 01:51:57.741
<v Speaker 1>humanitY.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just just to recognize the central </v>

2277
01:51:57.741 --> 01:51:58.590
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in that tradition and in others</v>

2278
01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:04.300
<v Speaker 1>that we were not born in this situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of research and a,</v>

2279
01:52:04.570 --> 01:52:06.340
<v Speaker 1>a perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2280
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:07.820
<v Speaker 1>or goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2281
01:52:07.850 --> 01:52:09.300
<v Speaker 1>quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite otherwise.</v>

2282
01:52:09.301 --> 01:52:12.480
<v Speaker 1>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are thIs very,</v>

2283
01:52:12.481 --> 01:52:15.960
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a contorted beIng,</v>

2284
01:52:16.650 --> 01:52:20.040
<v Speaker 1>a which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is capable of incredible greatness</v>

2285
01:52:20.490 --> 01:52:25.490
<v Speaker 1>and beauty and kindness and forgiveness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and also capable of they're opposites.</v>

2286
01:52:26.341 --> 01:52:28.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it's not,</v>

2287
01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:31.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not that you are one and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are the other,</v>

2288
01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:33.000
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of us,</v>

2289
01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:33.850
<v Speaker 1>all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2290
01:52:34.230 --> 01:52:35.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both,</v>

2291
01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:40.280
<v Speaker 1>all the time and so there never is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>victory and there never is a win other </v>

2292
01:52:41.581 --> 01:52:46.581
<v Speaker 1>than trying to deal with and restrain </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own worst impulses in the life that</v>

2293
01:52:49.761 --> 01:52:50.480
<v Speaker 1>you have</v>

2294
01:52:51.250 --> 01:52:55.300
<v Speaker 2>and honestly express all the issues that</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrive while you're trying to do,</v>

2295
01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:56.980
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2296
01:52:56.981 --> 01:52:57.370
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2297
01:52:57.830 --> 01:53:00.980
<v Speaker 1>and trying to tell the truth where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see it and,</v>

2298
01:53:01.330 --> 01:53:04.130
<v Speaker 1>and giving voice to it and trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2299
01:53:04.131 --> 01:53:05.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just,</v>

2300
01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:08.480
<v Speaker 1>it just seems so clear to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if people,</v>

2301
01:53:08.630 --> 01:53:13.630
<v Speaker 1>if people could realize this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>central problem of the thing that you </v>

2302
01:53:13.630 --> 01:53:16.670
<v Speaker 1>and I and others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all faith is the desire to claim that,</v>

2303
01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:22.100
<v Speaker 1>that somebody who disagrees on issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't just have a disagreeing mind but </v>

2304
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:29.270
<v Speaker 1>evil and that in any way we have in </v>
<v Speaker 1>britain,</v>

2305
01:53:29.271 --> 01:53:34.271
<v Speaker 1>we are ranked at the moment still by 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>months after a single vote on a single </v>

2306
01:53:34.271 --> 01:53:39.041
<v Speaker 1>matter of governance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are still wracked by really </v>

2307
01:53:39.041 --> 01:53:39.440
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant polItics from brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2308
01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:42.800
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect it's not an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate the overlap of the two,</v>

2309
01:53:42.801 --> 01:53:45.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably something like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump events here,</v>

2310
01:53:45.951 --> 01:53:48.530
<v Speaker 1>but again and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come back to the same thing,</v>

2311
01:53:48.531 --> 01:53:53.531
<v Speaker 1>which is just instead of thinking one </v>
<v Speaker 1>side is entirely right and the other </v>

2312
01:53:53.531 --> 01:53:57.640
<v Speaker 1>entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't say you give up on objective </v>

2313
01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.441
<v Speaker 1>factor anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just consider that your opponent </v>

2314
01:53:59.441 --> 01:54:02.711
<v Speaker 1>might be approaching us with an honest </v>
<v Speaker 1>motive and might have honest reasons for</v>

2315
01:54:03.081 --> 01:54:04.070
<v Speaker 1>disagreeing with you.</v>

2316
01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:08.630
<v Speaker 1>And in the absence of that and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>media just endlessly feeding us whatever</v>

2317
01:54:08.631 --> 01:54:13.631
<v Speaker 1>it is we know our own side happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think I'm in the absence of that.</v>

2318
01:54:13.701 --> 01:54:18.701
<v Speaker 1>I just see our trenches in both our </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries just being dug deeper and </v>

2319
01:54:18.701 --> 01:54:20.480
<v Speaker 1>deeper until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until there's just no hope of being able</v>

2320
01:54:20.481 --> 01:54:25.481
<v Speaker 1>to even shout over the top and be heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one can get to that stage if,</v>

2321
01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:27.650
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>

2322
01:54:27.651 --> 01:54:29.570
<v Speaker 1>you recognize that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2323
01:54:29.730 --> 01:54:34.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not a constant fight against nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2324
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2325
01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:39.830
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

2326
01:54:39.831 --> 01:54:44.831
<v Speaker 1>I'd also never to forget that the nazis </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't seem like the nazi's were a lot </v>

2327
01:54:44.831 --> 01:54:45.680
<v Speaker 1>of people when the nazis were being </v>
<v Speaker 1>nazis.</v>

2328
01:54:46.330 --> 01:54:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2329
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:49.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not as easy as that.</v>

2330
01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:52.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not in a,</v>

2331
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:58.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an easy way to demonize the other </v>

2332
01:54:58.350 --> 01:54:58.350
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2333
01:54:58.350 --> 01:54:58.650
<v Speaker 1>it's an easy way to prop up your side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2334
01:54:58.651 --> 01:55:01.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a cheap trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2335
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:06.550
<v Speaker 1>But going back to where we started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if the cheap trick ends up having </v>

2336
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:09.070
<v Speaker 1>some terrible consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2337
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:13.610
<v Speaker 1>of making all of our defenses go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2338
01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:15.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2339
01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:15.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2340
01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:18.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not</v>

2341
01:55:19.330 --> 01:55:20.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the both of you,</v>

2342
01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>very strange time.</v>
