1
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.910
Five thing too.

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.210
Hello Billy.
We're alive.
Yo Joe,
what's going on buddy?
How you doing?

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.750
I watch a new documentary this morning in the gym.
Loved it.
It was fucking great.

4
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.720
It's crazy.
I love your use of little kids.

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.880
I don't want to give away too much of it.
Uh,

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but it's about the steroid scandal involving baseball and Alex Rodriguez.

7
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:33.761
But what was the choice to use little kids to play a rod and all the other key

8
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:38.900
principles involved in the scandal?
Like till the platelet.
Use a little actors.

9
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.850
What kits?
Oh come on Fella.

10
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.510
You're just hided God it was pretty sober.

11
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.030
<v 2>The Gym.
Yeah.
Um,
so you,</v>

12
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.440
you now know this story cause you've seen the doc and if people remember the

13
00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:51.850
biogenesis steroid scandal,

14
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.760
if not the movie I think recaps it pretty pretty well.

15
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.980
But the thing that struck me is it like all these guys acted like children.

16
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.960
They really did.
And,
and to boot.
So,
you know,
we've done some,

17
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.670
some sports docs in the past.
We did,
you know,

18
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:10.260
some of the ESPN 30 for 30 is like the U.
And,
um,

19
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.610
when you do a sports doc,
I mean I don't want to say it's,
it's easy cause it's,

20
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.830
you know,
making documentaries is a challenge.

21
00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:20.440
But sports docs are pretty like paint by numbers.

22
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.350
It's like you interview some players,

23
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.570
interview some coaches and journalists,

24
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.290
they mentioned a bunch of games and you show a bunch of game footage.
You know,

25
00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:33.130
like it's a pretty straightforward process with this one.

26
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.430
It's not about baseball,
it's baseball adjacent I guess.

27
00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:40.030
But like it's about shit that went down in nightclubs,

28
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.470
in shady clinics with fake doctor's hotel rooms,
bars,

29
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.610
locker rooms.
So you got a bunch of guys talking heads and your documentary,

30
00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:51.130
but then you got,
you got nothing just cut to you.
You've got no B roll.

31
00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:54.970
So I'm like,
we're going to need to shoot recreates,
you know,
recreation's here,

32
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.180
which is,
which is to me,
I,
I dunno,

33
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.120
it's like when you're doing nonfiction filmmaking,
it's fake shit.

34
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.780
We need when you film recreation.
So it's like,
I'm like,

35
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:09.070
how do we do this in a creative way that that's consistent with the tone of the

36
00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:13.150
movie,
which was always called screw ball.
Meaning it was always like a farce,

37
00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:16.330
you know,
like a Carl Hiaasen or Elmore Leonard Cohen,

38
00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:19.360
brothers s sort of Florida fuckery farce.

39
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.600
And so we just wanted to keep in that,
in that mode.

40
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.290
So I'm watching the characters.
So we got Tony Bosch,
uh,

41
00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:30.460
who is the fake doctor and Porter Fisher who was the whistle blower who stole

42
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.240
the medical records and,
and started this whole thing.

43
00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:38.320
They were then stolen from him and then sold to not the highest bidder but any

44
00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:40.270
bitter and every bitter they were sold to.

45
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.300
And they're talking and I'm noticing that they had like a very similar

46
00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:49.090
storytelling style.
Like for example,
guys will be like,

47
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.010
so I walked into his office and I say,
I want my money and he says,

48
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.790
I don't have your money.
And I said,
well,
you better get my money.
And he said,

49
00:02:57.791 --> 00:02:59.890
what are you going to do about it?
And I,
I'm going to break your net.

50
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:04.550
And I'm like,
Oh shit,
they're so vivid.
And in the moment and,

51
00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:08.950
and,
and talking dialogue.
So we could trunk history this,
right?
We can,

52
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.760
we can edit together the doc.
And then have the actors lip sinking,

53
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.080
the actual interview dialogue and all the actors will be eight years old.

54
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.910
And I don't know,
like I,

55
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.820
I've always wanted to do it like way back a Spike Jones,
1997 biggy video.

56
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:27.160
Sky's the limit.
Biggie adjustment murdered.

57
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.550
He was faced with this challenge of producing a posthumous video.

58
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.470
And so spike Jones was like,
okay,

59
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.280
we'll just do a straight up classic bad boy records Circa [inaudible] 97 music

60
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:45.070
video cars,
Versace,

61
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.600
wardrobe girls,
Manchin,
hot tub,

62
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.900
but they'll all be eight years old.
You got baby biggie,

63
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.070
maybe puffy because baby Busta rhymes baby.
A little kid.
Yeah,
it's brilliant.

64
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.980
And so I was like,
what a great diva that was always kicking around since,

65
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:04.750
since 97 and then I saw this off Broadway musical about 10 tennis years ago

66
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.680
called a very merry on [inaudible].
Let me try that one more time.

67
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.030
A very merry unauthorized children's Scientology pageant.

68
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.210
I don't ask me to say it again.
I can't say it again.
Um,
so it's this,

69
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.980
it's this wild musical,

70
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.140
like very Bowie esque score written by a couple of Yalies.
Like,
it's like it's a,

71
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.260
it's a Christmas pageant performed by elementary school kids,

72
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:31.090
but instead of the story of Jesus,

73
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.270
it's the story of l Ron Hubbard all with like in like a school play with like,

74
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.580
you know,
paper Mushy,
like sets and,
and,

75
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.440
and construction paper costumes and props.
And I wanted to,

76
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.600
I got together with one of the composers,
I had said,
listen,

77
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:51.550
I'd like to get the rights to your musical and make a Scientology documentary

78
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.750
using the kids and the musical as a framing device because in those days,

79
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:58.840
no one was making,
everybody makes Scientology documentaries in those days,

80
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.910
nobody was doing it particularly because like the church is so litigious and so

81
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.830
they had kind of left this musical alone.

82
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.480
So I thought like that might be a cool buffer.

83
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.570
Like maybe if I make a documentary,
it's a little light,
you know,

84
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:14.440
and it's like this children's musical,
but we intercut it with real,

85
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.780
real documentary investigation interviews and um,

86
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.420
that maybe we'll kind of get away with it.

87
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.560
Nobody wanted to make that movie to me.
Nobody,
I mean,

88
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:26.930
doors are closing before I even knocked out,
like got to them.
Um,

89
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.030
and I kind of filed again filed that idea away in the back of my head.
And then,

90
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.140
um,
a couple years ago there was that funny viral video of like,

91
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:38.530
it was like a scar face school play.

92
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.980
I don't know if it was like a bunch of little kids doing scarfaces like an

93
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:45.730
elementary school play.
And I was like,
this is such a,

94
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.120
it's such a great device and the problem is you need to find something that it

95
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:52.120
works for.
Like,
like cocaine,
cal babies would not have been appropriate,

96
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.020
for example,
of much eight year old kids running around.
It's not Bugsy Malone,

97
00:05:56.021 --> 00:06:00.440
you know?
So,
um,
it just like,
it just like kind of the stars align.
We just like,

98
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.370
I was like,
this is,
this is going to work here.
I think it works.
It works great.

99
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:06.920
And it's such a crazy story and the fat,
well,

100
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:09.440
I don't want to give too much of it away because I really want people to watch

101
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:10.550
it because I mean I've,

102
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.150
I've talked about cocaine cowboys probably a hundred times in this podcast.

103
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:16.580
It's one of my all time favorite pod.
Thank you.
Excuse me all time.

104
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:21.290
Favorite documentaries.
But this is,
this is a story that almost writes itself.

105
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.810
It's so bonkers that,

106
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.340
and the fact that it all could have been avoided if one guy just paid another

107
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:33.140
guy or just didn't try to rip them off like four grand.
Yeah.
Like nothing.

108
00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:36.980
It doesn't make any sense.
It's fucking crazy.
And the guy,

109
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.150
what a bizarro personality he was who just Tan every day and hang out at this

110
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:48.710
doctor's office in the waiting room telling everybody how great it was.

111
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:51.430
Like the whole thing is so strange.
Like that's,

112
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.010
everybody remembers it as like the a rod or a roid scandal,
you know?
And,

113
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.420
and the truth of the matter is it,

114
00:06:56.421 --> 00:07:00.470
Alex Rodriguez was collateral damage in this whole thing.

115
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.160
It was not about him.
Don't tell Alex that,
but it's not about him.
You know,

116
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:06.830
it's it,
it was really the highest,

117
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.890
the career of the highest paid baseball player of all time effectively ended

118
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.770
over a $4,000 debt between this cocaine addicted fake doctor and his fake tan

119
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:23.180
addicted steroid patient.
And it's like,
that's what I said,

120
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:25.100
it's like a Florida fuckery stories straight up.

121
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.630
It just like this classic only in Miami,
absurd farce.

122
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.160
And if that's what you specialize in,

123
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.830
special as it Florida fuckery,

124
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.680
I go to your Twitter feed all the time for a current Florida fucker.
It's just,

125
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.450
it's,
yeah,
it's distilled.
It's just like,
it's pure.

126
00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:45.010
It's 100% Florida fuckery is just,
it's,

127
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.350
and that's what this story is to me.
Cause like Miami is just,

128
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.290
well they say the great thing about Miami is it's so close to the United States,

129
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:54.830
but like,
it's also like,
it's a narrow,

130
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:56.420
because Casa Blanca,

131
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.900
like just people kind of flee to Miami from like all over the country and all

132
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:03.404
over the world,

133
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.920
usually leaving some kind of criminality in their wake and you know,

134
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.200
come here and kind of there and reinvent themselves.
You know,
like it's just,

135
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.220
and then you have all of these criminals there who then kind of baking in the

136
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:20.090
sun,
you know,
in this kind of multicultural fucking [inaudible],
you know,

137
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:23.190
that we have.
And then they just like,
and then they start putting their,

138
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.950
their minds together and brainstorming and they hatch just the most inane

139
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.360
schemes and scams.

140
00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:33.230
Like that's our primary export from Miami is just schemes and scams.
Well,

141
00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:36.080
it's just so amazing that it's still a cocaine culture too.

142
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:37.460
After all these years,

143
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:42.490
it's still has a giant cocaine engine pumping out all this chaos.

144
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.740
We don't have any indigenous industry.

145
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.610
I mean there's no factory where everybody goes to work and then 30 years later

146
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:53.360
it gets a watch.
There's no,
there's no business there.
It's Carl Hiaasen says,

147
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.090
all we produce in Florida is oranges and machine guns.
We don't,

148
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.720
we don't make anything that we sell the dream.
We sell the sunshine.
You know,

149
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.600
it's lies that came true,
you know,
and so,

150
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.990
and even more frightening is the Miami of today is the America of tomorrow.

151
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:09.720
So it's like there's a lot of lessons to be gleaned from down there,

152
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.490
but it's basically at this point,
uh,
money,
uh,

153
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:14.160
real estate hustle at a money laundering capital.

154
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.560
So it's really no different than it ever was.

155
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:18.990
Everybody likes to tell me how it's changed.
It's grown.
I'm like,

156
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.260
just because you've built a bunch of shit doesn't mean we've grown.

157
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.330
And Miami is just like,
Niamey is one of the youngest cities in the country.

158
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.020
In your parlance,
it would be about one person old or one and a half.

159
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:35.690
People that go like one and a half.
People that go,
you know,
like
we're the,

160
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.020
we're one of the youngest cities,
um,
barely a hundred,
just over a hundred.

161
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.390
You know,
correct me if I'm wrong cause I've said this before,

162
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:46.800
but isn't there more banks per capita in Miami than anywhere else?
Well,

163
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:50.640
certainly there certainly was,
um,
before the,
you know,
the,
the,
uh,

164
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.250
the great recession when a lot of them started shutting down,

165
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:55.080
but most of them have rebounded.
Uh,

166
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:58.260
one of the clever things some of the real estate developers did was they opened

167
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:00.990
their own bank,
literally their own bank.

168
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.190
They had a bank where the entire board of the bank were all real estate

169
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:10.191
developers and over 90% of the loans the bank made was insider loans just to the

170
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:14.160
board.
And then of course they went belly up in the great recession.

171
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:16.080
And what happened?
We bailed them out.

172
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.760
It was all their own shit failed out real estate salesman,

173
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:25.790
real estates who loaned themselves money that is wound up being backed

174
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.930
ultimately by us.
By the taxpayer.
Yeah,
I mean that's the old,
remember that.

175
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.300
I mean you hear that line all the time now that like,
you know,
um,

176
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.720
the people used to rob the bank from the outside in.

177
00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:40.560
Now it's now it's from the inside out.
But no,
none could be truer than,
than,

178
00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:43.950
than that story.
And that's a Miami story.
And when the great recession happened,

179
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:49.200
the see had to open an office in Florida because we had more bank closures than

180
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:52.770
any other state in the union cause we were like,
you could go down there.

181
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.640
I mean you could buy a fucking mortgage for your dog at a drive through in
Miami,

182
00:10:56.641 --> 00:11:01.150
in the,
in like the,
the late nineties,
early aughts.
And,
um,

183
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.810
I remember interviewing a guy,
um,
we were doing,

184
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.170
working on a project called Ponzi state,
uh,
about the state of Florida as like a,

185
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.350
a case study in the great recession years ago.

186
00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:14.550
He never finished it unfortunately,
but we're interviewing this guy and he says,

187
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.440
um,
you know,
we were,

188
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.520
and this is pre like big short like this before anybody sort of knew a lot about

189
00:11:20.521 --> 00:11:20.701
this.

190
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:25.701
And he said we were down here in Miami setting fires and Wall Street was trying

191
00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:27.600
to read our smoke signals.

192
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.290
That's why I say like the Miami of today is the America of tomorrow.

193
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.010
It's every time I go there I always go,

194
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:39.750
I forgot how fucking crazy this way so you really should have to have a
passport.

195
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.240
I love it.
I really do love it.
It's a crazy place to do stand up.

196
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:49.260
You know I did this job cause I was doing a Netflix special and I was doing it a

197
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.560
couple months after I did this Gig in Miami and so I was using those yonder
bags.

198
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:54.100
You know what those are

199
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.710
<v 1>what people have to put their cell phone into this magnetic bag.</v>

200
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.040
You keep the phone but you hold the phone in if you want to use it.

201
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:01.180
You just have to step outside of the,

202
00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:04.390
opened up the bag and they give you your phone in every other city.

203
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.100
It made for a better show because people just sat down and watched the show in

204
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:09.790
Miami.

205
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:14.790
It made for literally 40% of the crowd at any given time was getting up and

206
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:18.280
going to the back and using their phone and coming back in.

207
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.210
They were just constantly moving around and presume what was to use their phone.

208
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:24.950
They might be a bit powdering their noses,
they might've been,
but it was the,

209
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.960
you know there was,

210
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:29.980
because I had done gigs before that where they didn't have the yonder bags and

211
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:33.220
this wasn't the problem but in Miami everybody needed to use their phones.

212
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.040
They just kept getting up and coming back and it was just chaos.

213
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.580
Well it's also a selfish town.
Like it's basically a town,

214
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.360
a town of assholes really.
And,
and so like I always say that,
I mean it,

215
00:12:44.361 --> 00:12:48.010
it reflects in everything that we do in the way that we behave certainly in the

216
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:49.780
way that we drive.
Like believe it or not,

217
00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:53.710
like people are so much more chill and calm here in traffic in La.

218
00:12:53.711 --> 00:12:57.660
I swear to God and La was famous for like road rage,
like Ellie,
like

219
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.400
created,
invented road rage.
But like Miami is such a crazy,
angry,

220
00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:07.180
weird place cause it's like when push comes to shove,
we're in Miami,

221
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:09.040
chill the fuck out.
Like it's,
it's all good.

222
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:11.620
It's a beautiful place and it's a shared experience.

223
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.420
The traffic sucks for all of us.

224
00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:17.140
Just chill out and use your turn signal for crying out loud and just,

225
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:20.740
but that's why they,
I say that's why they call it Miami.

226
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.450
It's not an hour and or your Emmy,

227
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:26.160
it's my fucking Amie and stay out of my fucking Amie.
It's just,

228
00:13:26.161 --> 00:13:29.770
I don't usually seem to love it.
You seem to thrive.
Yeah.

229
00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:34.210
I can't really function anywhere else.
Uh,
that doesn't make any sense.

230
00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:37.820
It doesn't make any sense.
It's,
and it's so frustrating to,
I was,
you know,

231
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.920
I'm a native Floridian and a lifelong Miami and I,
for a while I was,

232
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:47.290
I was pretty determined to like leave behind a better Florida than the one I
was.

233
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:51.500
I was born in
fail.
They fail.

234
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:57.650
The publisher is like,
so inexorably connected to cocaine.
Um,

235
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.550
one of my best friends,
Steve Graham,
was an ophthalmologist.

236
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.680
He did his residency in Miami.

237
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:07.950
So he did his residency in emergency rooms in Miami and he was there in the 80s

238
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:13.350
during like the height basically during when cocaine cowboys takes place and he

239
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:15.010
saw everything.

240
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:20.500
He mean he had all these pictures of bullet holes and skull fragments and people

241
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:25.741
with light bulbs stuffed up their asses and he said it every day was just

242
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:28.630
fucking chaos.
So we call it Miami idea.

243
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.930
Everywhere else the light bulb goes off over your head and Miami we shove it

244
00:14:31.931 --> 00:14:32.880
right up our asses.

245
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.560
I said they had a pool light bulb out of a guy's ass in one of those ones that

246
00:14:37.561 --> 00:14:39.940
look like a Christmas tree.
Those curly ones,

247
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.060
this guy stuck a light bulb off his ass and it broke in his ass.

248
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.950
At least he was concerned about the environment.

249
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:47.200
That's like one of those environmentally like sound like good,

250
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.710
no environmentally sound times and that they were just thicker glass.

251
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.140
<v 2>Felt like he could get it in his ass better.</v>

252
00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:01.010
Well that was the error to cut your teeth if you were a cop or a lawyer or a

253
00:15:01.071 --> 00:15:04.340
journalist or an er doctor.
I remember talking to any Er doctor once,

254
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:08.900
he tells me a story,
1980,
shortly after the Mariel boatlift started,

255
00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:12.740
which I think everybody's kind of pop culture frame of reference for the Mariel

256
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:13.760
boatlift as Scarface.

257
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:16.970
Tony Montana was a Mary Alito that's at the beginning of the movie when,

258
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:17.660
you know,

259
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.320
Castro is ranting and raving that he's flushing the toilets of Cuba onto the

260
00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:24.630
United States,
specifically to Miami.
And um,

261
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.750
so he was working at the,
uh,
the trauma center at Jackson Memorial,

262
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.550
our emergency room at in Miami.
And he said he got a Mariel refugee.

263
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.940
These guys would stand at the beach.
They would,
um,

264
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.370
it looked like Havana in south beach.
You know,

265
00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:42.400
like there's that like coral sea wall and it's just like,

266
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.660
it had a really Havana vibe.
So they would go,

267
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.760
they would chill mostly at these flop houses,

268
00:15:46.761 --> 00:15:50.300
south of fifth street in Miami Beach,
where like the cops would literally just,

269
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:54.650
they would be leaving after a stabbing at one of these places and they'd be

270
00:15:54.651 --> 00:15:55.281
three blocks away.

271
00:15:55.281 --> 00:15:58.610
They get a call to go back because now there was a shooting or something else.

272
00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:01.640
They would be going there like a all around the clock and so,

273
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.280
and they would just get in gunfights like literally would just be like they,

274
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.380
someone would cheat it dominoes and they would just pull out a gun and one guy

275
00:16:09.381 --> 00:16:11.400
would shoot the other guy.
And so he hasn't,

276
00:16:11.401 --> 00:16:15.620
Mariel refugee who comes in to the emergency room with a gunshot wound and he

277
00:16:15.621 --> 00:16:17.700
knew Spanish,
he was bilingual.
He said to the guy,
said,

278
00:16:17.701 --> 00:16:21.590
you're really lucky because if this bullet had hit,
you know,

279
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:26.340
few centimeters or whatever,
this way you would've died immediately.

280
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.830
You would have bled out right there on the scene.

281
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.300
Died instantly and guide splits.
A few days later,

282
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:37.870
another Mariel refugee comes in with a gunshot wound in exactly the same spot

283
00:16:38.091 --> 00:16:41.550
where he had told the other guy that if he got hit there,
he would have died,

284
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.720
could never prove it,
never was able to trace it back.

285
00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:48.860
But he was pretty well convinced that it was a revenge shooting or the other

286
00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:52.790
shooting and the guy knew exactly where to shoot him and kill him because the

287
00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:56.720
doctor had told them where to do that.
But that was like every day in Miami.

288
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.900
The lady who cuts my hair for Christ sake,
she said,
Billy,

289
00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:03.350
I was so naive in those days,
you know,
you,
you,
she's,
I cut people's hair.

290
00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:06.530
You know,
they come over to kiss her goodbye and put a tip in her,
in her pocket,

291
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.500
you know,
and she'd go home,
turn her pockets inside out,

292
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.540
have our little crumbled bills and everything.

293
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:15.710
And one day she finds a little Baggie of white powder that someone that one of

294
00:17:15.711 --> 00:17:19.340
her clients had slipped into her pocket as a tip.
And she said to her girlfriend,

295
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:22.280
she's,
what?
What the hell is this?
And our friend said,
oh shit,

296
00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:25.850
that's worth more than gold.
That's the best tip you got.
You got all day,

297
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.650
that little Baggie.
But that was just like the culture.
And it's,
and it's,
I mean,

298
00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:35.540
it's not that,
it's not anywhere else.
Imagine that.
And like in Nebraska,

299
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:40.690
someone Tebah new and cocaine,
people would be like,
what?
What the,

300
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:45.470
what the fuck are you doing?
Listen,
it's just like,
like I said,

301
00:17:45.471 --> 00:17:49.740
it's like America's Casa Blanca.
It's no place like it.
It's such a strange place.

302
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.210
Strange.
Everything is for sale still nothing,
you know.
And like I said,

303
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:59.080
we are about a person old.
That's how far back Miami goes.

304
00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.790
I was watching a video about um,

305
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.550
the culture of renting supercars to people so that they can pretend that it's

306
00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:08.910
their car.
Huge in Miami.
Yeah.

307
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.030
We got all these brickle brickle least a thousand years,
you know,

308
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.170
driving their rented fucking lamb bows and blowing the engines out on south

309
00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:17.500
beach cause they don't know how to drive them.

310
00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:22.950
They just getting towed down the street is just listen,

311
00:18:22.951 --> 00:18:26.220
it's a fake it till you make it kind of town and there's nothing really to make

312
00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:31.140
there.
You can't really,
other than a real estate hustle,
money laundering,
drugs,

313
00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:33.150
politics,
being a crop politician,

314
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.960
there's really no other way to make it as not a real industry.
No,
not at all.

315
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:41.490
There's a lot of professional fighters come out of Miami,
that whole area,

316
00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.080
coconut grove and a lot of aggression,
a lot of poverty.
It's a,

317
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.060
it's a third world economy down there.

318
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.820
The disparity between the haves and the have nots.

319
00:18:50.821 --> 00:18:55.821
The income gap is widest and getting wider in Miami Dade county than just about

320
00:18:56.491 --> 00:19:00.750
any city in the country or any,
any metropolitan area in the country.
So,

321
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.570
and that's why I said the Miami,
if today is the America of tomorrow,

322
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:08.571
if you want to know what challenges we'll face as a nation or calamities will

323
00:19:08.611 --> 00:19:11.520
befall us in the years to come,
you need only look at,

324
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:16.140
at Miami TD Allman called it the canary in the coal mine,
the bellwether.
And so,

325
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:16.951
you know when,
when,

326
00:19:16.951 --> 00:19:20.850
when the election was playing out the cycle in 2016 I was like,

327
00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.000
it all my friends are just like this,
can,
this Trump thing can't happen.

328
00:19:24.001 --> 00:19:25.500
I was like,
hang on,

329
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:30.890
I'll say Florida elected and in fact reelected Rick Scott to be governor.

330
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.490
He is the biggest medicare fraudster in the history of the United States.

331
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:40.080
Everybody knows it.
Everybody is aware of it.
It's very well publicized.
We've,

332
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.820
we reelected him,
okay.
We,
we,

333
00:19:41.821 --> 00:19:46.770
we elected him twice as the top fucking executive in our state.
Like,

334
00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:51.660
what makes you think that the United States of America wouldn't do that?

335
00:19:51.661 --> 00:19:53.160
And I know it's fair to say like,
you know,

336
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.770
if you're going to be the governor of the state,

337
00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.250
you should know a little something about the largest industry in the state.

338
00:19:59.251 --> 00:20:00.600
Like you're going to be the governor of Michigan,

339
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:05.010
you should have some familiarity with the automobile industry in manufacturing

340
00:20:05.011 --> 00:20:07.200
and in Florida.
If you're going to be the governor,

341
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.560
arguably you should know something about our biggest industry,

342
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:12.420
which has medicare fraud basically.
I mean,

343
00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:15.750
you could argue that he's the most qualified man for the job.
Oh yeah.

344
00:20:15.751 --> 00:20:19.470
We got like Medicare fraud is,
has,
is one of the largest industries,

345
00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:20.490
has been for decades.

346
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:24.750
I mean we have billions and billions of dollars in fraud that just comes out it.

347
00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:29.130
So they run it.
So you'll go into like little Havana Hialeah,
for example,

348
00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:32.340
in a municipality and in Miami Dade,

349
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:36.810
and there'll be a little Alita sitting behind a desk,
half asleep,

350
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.670
and she'll be surrounded in this tiny little one room office by little

351
00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:42.960
mailboxes,
you know,

352
00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:47.961
like po boxes and a mail man comes in every day and just puts checks in the

353
00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.810
boxes and they're like,

354
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:58.330
in some cases they've stolen,
um,
uh,
social security numbers and,

355
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.450
and you know,
uh,
uh,
stolen identities basically.

356
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.410
And some cases they're just old people who aren't aware that their mail is being

357
00:21:05.411 --> 00:21:08.740
forwarded to this location.
And they've just got the,

358
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.920
I think Miami for awhile we had more medicare payments for HIV and AIDS

359
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:20.230
medication than every other part of the country combined.

360
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.390
And it's all just old people.
So it's like,

361
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:27.760
you'd have to assume that 100% of our elderly population suffered from HIV had

362
00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:30.430
HIV were HIV positive.
I mean,
fucking impossible.

363
00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.490
You had female patients getting penis pumps that were paid for by,

364
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.820
I don't even know that Medicare covered that.
I gotta look into that.

365
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.630
But I know that was a thing.
Well,
thanks Obama.

366
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.840
You watched the oxycontin express just now,

367
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.320
but that's all about how they would have the pain management centers and they

368
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:50.840
were connected to the pharmacies.
You'd go to the doctor,
hey my back hurts you.

369
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.300
Well you need this go right next door and you score it.

370
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.910
All they would describe was oxys and sometimes it wasn't even next door.

371
00:21:57.911 --> 00:22:00.490
Sometimes he was like,
go to that window.
Yeah,
right next door.

372
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.790
They say she'll show the doctor your x-ray.

373
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.350
You'd have to get your x ray done somewhere else cause they weren't doing it.

374
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.050
So in hand,
the doctor,
your ray,
he look at it go,
oh shit.
It was upside down.

375
00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.190
He wouldn't,
he wouldn't even give me like,
Oh yeah,
oh shit,

376
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.200
you know what you need,
go to that window over there and fill this prescription.

377
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.090
And we had more pill mills.
They called them in Broward County,

378
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:23.890
which is the county just north of Miami Dade.

379
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.160
Then we had McDonald's locations and there was literally like the Appalachian

380
00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:30.550
trail.
They were coming down,

381
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.940
they were stocking up on oxy and we were fueling a death epidemic like in,

382
00:22:37.331 --> 00:22:42.130
in Kentucky.
And when they're pulling over more cars with Florida plates,

383
00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.730
then instate plates up there because Floridians were like,
well shit,

384
00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:49.060
we can't let them have all the action will drive up and we'll export the shit.

385
00:22:49.061 --> 00:22:52.930
And at the peak of the pill mill epidemic,
the oxy epidemic in Florida,

386
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.800
seven people a day were dying men,
women and children.
And,

387
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.380
and we subsist from hustle,
the hustle.

388
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.540
You wonder why didn't the government cracked down on that shit?

389
00:23:01.541 --> 00:23:02.410
Why didn't they regulate it?
Well,

390
00:23:02.411 --> 00:23:07.120
first our governor and we di we deal with this and screw ball is the biggest

391
00:23:07.121 --> 00:23:08.590
medicare fraudster in the history of the country.

392
00:23:08.591 --> 00:23:10.150
So he wasn't exactly shall we say,

393
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:15.360
vigilant or interested in cracking down on medical related fraud away with it.

394
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.360
Magic Maga,
Maga magic I guess.
I mean,
listen,
he,
he,

395
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:23.770
he got,

396
00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:28.770
he pled the Fifth Amendment like 75 times in the videotaped deposition that was

397
00:23:29.081 --> 00:23:32.920
used in a campaign ad against him.
And Florida was like,
we're good,

398
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.020
we're good with that.
And he just,

399
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.860
I listen white Richmond kind of walk between the raindrops in this country,

400
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.310
you know,
it's just uh,
well sort of,
they got craft for getting a hand job.

401
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.100
That was Florida too.
So stupid.
It's crazy

402
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.580
<v 1>stupid.</v>

403
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.040
It's cool what we were talking about it like how does he not have a guy who you

404
00:23:50.041 --> 00:23:51.170
get him jerked off?

405
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.470
Like there's probably a lot of gals out there that would like to make some
money.

406
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.510
You don't,
you don't have to go to a massage parlor.
The biggest bummer of it is,

407
00:23:57.511 --> 00:24:01.540
is now my massage parlors closed down.
That's the problem.
Where do I go now?

408
00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.410
It's the crop.
We were broke.
Guys go,

409
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:08.330
well the fact that they were filming you too,
like the whole thing,

410
00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:11.720
it's so strange.
And if there was human trafficking going on,

411
00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:15.580
there were cops chilling there for like six months and some ongoing

412
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.930
investigation.
Can you save these poor victims?

413
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.490
But human trafficking has become like this keyword and it's like this new sort

414
00:24:22.491 --> 00:24:27.350
of like fearmongering kind of a term to get everybody all up in arms and now

415
00:24:27.351 --> 00:24:29.090
they're kind of backtracking on that.
They're like,
well,

416
00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:32.120
maybe it wasn't exactly redrafting.

417
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.990
Maybe it was just more of prostitution reason why he was a horrible person

418
00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:39.170
because he was contributing to these people that were essentially being sold for

419
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:42.770
sex slavery.
Turns out that might have been a bit overblown,
no pun intended,

420
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.520
of block overblown.
But of course that's kind of how they have to sell it,
Ryan.

421
00:24:46.521 --> 00:24:49.820
Otherwise people are like,
why are you wasting all this money on hand jobs?

422
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.360
No one cares why?

423
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.330
Because solving real crime is hard and dangerous and dangerous.
Okay.

424
00:24:56.331 --> 00:25:00.230
So you can go and pick somebody up for marijuana or getting a hand job or

425
00:25:00.231 --> 00:25:02.180
whatever and you can look like you're,

426
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:06.890
you're being proactive but solving a murder.
So that's hard,
man.

427
00:25:06.891 --> 00:25:10.520
That's hard work.
Hard,
dangerous.
And you know,

428
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.690
if you go to a weird little Asian massage place and guys are coming out smiling

429
00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:18.560
like,
hmm,
it's a,
you can start there.
Yeah.
You know,

430
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.160
talking about low hanging fruit,
real offense to crafts,

431
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.120
that's probably older fellow.
There was a,

432
00:25:26.121 --> 00:25:29.900
a weird law in Hawaii where they were letting cops actually have sex with

433
00:25:29.901 --> 00:25:33.020
prostitutes,
like to prove that they were prostitutes.

434
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:38.560
I think nearly half the states in the union have a law that allow police

435
00:25:38.991 --> 00:25:43.760
officers to have sex with people in custody.
Why?
Yeah.
Really?

436
00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.870
I can't make it.
How did he make this shit up?
That's,
and they're saying,
oh,

437
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.090
well it was consensual becomes that consensual.
They're in fucking handcuffs.

438
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:53.600
So to mean it's consensual.
Like what?
That's human trafficking.
If you asked me,

439
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.860
I mean,
well,
yeah,
obviously they're going to try to make deals.
Hey,

440
00:25:57.861 --> 00:26:01.130
I'll suck your deck if you'd get me out of here.
How's that?

441
00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:05.420
How's that consensual?
How's that legal?
It's crazy.
Is the ultimate,
I mean,

442
00:26:05.421 --> 00:26:08.380
he talked about people holding power over people.
The kit,

443
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.480
ultimate coerced consent.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
I mean that is,

444
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.470
that is more than an employer doing that to an employee.
I mean,

445
00:26:15.471 --> 00:26:19.310
you're literally dangling there.
Freedom.
Talk about an abuse of power.
Seriously,

446
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:23.450
I just look,
I have all daughters.
I'm,
I'm not,

447
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.610
I don't want anybody's daughter to be a prostitute,

448
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.700
but I'm also 100% in favor of people being able to do whatever the fuck they

449
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:32.690
want.

450
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.690
And if someone's in a weird stage in their life where they'd rather jerk guys

451
00:26:35.691 --> 00:26:39.980
off,
then work at Denny's,
like who is anybody to stop them from doing that?

452
00:26:39.981 --> 00:26:42.710
The only problem is the social stigma that's attached to it.

453
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:46.320
The actual act itself is,
it's beneficial though.

454
00:26:46.321 --> 00:26:48.990
The person gets something out of it,
you know?
I mean there's,

455
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.460
it's w p some people have a really hard time getting someone to have sex with

456
00:26:53.461 --> 00:26:54.780
them.
You know,
it's,

457
00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:58.680
I don't see it that it's just a crazy thing that we regulate something that mean

458
00:26:58.681 --> 00:27:03.681
George Carlin had a great bit about it as the only thing where it's illegal to

459
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.710
do,
to make someone pay for it.
But it's fine if it's free.

460
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.160
I get literally doesn't make sense.
There's nothing wrong with sex,

461
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:13.350
but there's something wrong with people paying for it

462
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.090
<v 2>and it's fine if you pay for it and then video tape it for distribution.</v>

463
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:20.510
Cause then that's,
yeah,
I don't really,

464
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.710
first of all it's a contract between two consenting adults.
If we,

465
00:27:24.711 --> 00:27:28.190
if we're talking about small government deregulation,

466
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.100
let's allow two consenting adults to engage in a contractual relationships,

467
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.530
offer acceptance consideration.
As with anything else,
a stigma.

468
00:27:36.531 --> 00:27:40.880
As you mentioned,
a lot of that is part and parcel of the prohibition.

469
00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:45.200
The illegality of it is what brings the seediness.

470
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:49.700
It's what brings the danger that it,
because it's forced underground,

471
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.480
uh,
you,
you introduce all of these elements that don't have to be there.

472
00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.990
They can take place in clean environments.

473
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.270
They can take place instead of in the black market and underground.

474
00:27:59.271 --> 00:28:04.271
It could take place in a where you can protect all the participants involved and

475
00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:09.050
it,
it,
it,
but it's been true of liquor.
It's been true of marijuana.

476
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.850
It's been true of,
uh,
prostitution,
which they call for a reason,

477
00:28:13.851 --> 00:28:15.880
the oldest profession.
Um,

478
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:22.250
the second we introduce the prohibition a creates a level of,

479
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.330
of danger and a threat to society that wouldn't exist.
If you're like,
well,
wait,

480
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.760
what if you just let me smoke this?

481
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.360
What if you just let me drink this because I'm an adult making a responsible

482
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:33.620
decision for myself.

483
00:28:33.621 --> 00:28:37.220
What if you just let me engage in sexual activity with this person who is

484
00:28:37.221 --> 00:28:40.490
perfectly willing to do it in exchange for some renumeration?

485
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:44.010
What the why should anybody give a shit about so pure tax.

486
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:49.140
<v 1>It's so archaic.
It's such a dumb,
proven bad idea.</v>

487
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.100
It's,
I mean,
it's been proven for decade upon decade.
Oh,

488
00:28:53.101 --> 00:28:57.570
you go all the way back to the alcohol prohibition to what's going on right now

489
00:28:57.571 --> 00:28:59.670
with the cartels.
I mean,
what,

490
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:03.420
how much would it fix if they made all drugs legal?

491
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.880
How much would it fix?
I mean we,

492
00:29:05.881 --> 00:29:10.320
we'd have a real problem in the beginning with access where people would,

493
00:29:10.321 --> 00:29:13.960
there would be so much more access.
You'd probably,
you know,
we,

494
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.300
you would lose people.

495
00:29:15.301 --> 00:29:19.500
People would die and high profile overdose cases and people would try to make a

496
00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:20.310
deal out of it.

497
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:25.310
You don't think that cocaine was legal everywhere that meth people can get the

498
00:29:26.281 --> 00:29:29.370
drugs.
Right,
but it's not that easy for a person.
Like,

499
00:29:29.371 --> 00:29:33.930
if you don't know anybody who's a criminal,
like say if you want to buy meth now,

500
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.810
I don't know where to buy math.
I just,
I know a few Walmarts in Florida,

501
00:29:36.811 --> 00:29:41.130
they make it in the bathroom that you do with that.
Again,
that is Florida.

502
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.120
It's a different animal.
But like right now in America,
I mean,

503
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:50.440
I maybe could drum up some meth and a few days if I started asking,
but,
uh,

504
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.710
you know,

505
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.400
I would not have any idea who was an informant and who's going to rat me out.

506
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.330
But I think the stats show in states where marijuana has become legal,

507
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.890
you don't see significant spikes in usage.
Parents,
it's minimal.
There's,

508
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.960
there's some significant spikes and uses.

509
00:30:04.961 --> 00:30:09.490
But the problem is it correlates to a significant spike in population in the

510
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:13.810
state.
Right.
A lot of people moved to Colorado just because of marijuana.

511
00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:17.110
They moved to become a part of the business and because they just wanted to be

512
00:30:17.111 --> 00:30:21.010
free,
you know?
And then California,
we've had medical weed forever.

513
00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:25.000
Now we have legal,
legal weed.
And I don't think it's changed much here.

514
00:30:25.001 --> 00:30:28.390
But you do have,
there's,
there's some,
there's some issues.
There's,

515
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:29.171
there's definitely,
I mean,

516
00:30:29.171 --> 00:30:34.171
I don't think it's beneficial in any way to sugarcoat the fact that having legal

517
00:30:34.601 --> 00:30:37.000
drugs makes people have more access to those drugs.

518
00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:40.840
Means means maybe there's going to be a few people,
whatever the number is,

519
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:44.500
who do those drugs,
who wouldn't have had access to them without it?
I thought,

520
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.270
I agree,
but I think it's diminimous.
I think it's like,

521
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.040
I think and the number of people who's going to turn around go like,

522
00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:53.420
you know what?
I want to try it.
It's legal now.
Math,

523
00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.140
like dentists doesn't recommend it,
but I feel like I went,

524
00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.390
who the fuck's gonna do that?
You say that,

525
00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:03.420
but how many fucking people were on Adderall and the only differences shit,

526
00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.160
the doctor's prescribing it to,
it's really good shit.

527
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.620
That's what the president bumps said.
Yeah,
that's what I hear you're saying that.

528
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:11.710
Do you think he does?
He said we sniffing and he always,
well,
here's the,

529
00:31:11.711 --> 00:31:16.120
I don't think he's on cocaine.
So,
and I always describe to people who don't,

530
00:31:16.121 --> 00:31:17.320
who don't know what this is like.

531
00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:22.030
People on cocaine start one sentence and then finish another.

532
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:22.920
Right.

533
00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.110
But it's like talking to someone on cocaine or the precedent and they just,

534
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.590
but I don't think he's on,
but he's always,
you always hear him with the stuff.

535
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.800
I think he's like bumping addy.
I,
I don't know.
I don't think he's bumping it,

536
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:36.580
but I think he's definitely,
well,
he might be,
why am I seeking,
to me it's not,

537
00:31:36.581 --> 00:31:38.290
I mean he's,
he's a wild man,

538
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:43.590
but he's definitely got accusations from his past about use of and fet amines.

539
00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:45.850
There was a,

540
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.740
there was a journalist that actually detailed the very Duane reed pharmacy where

541
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:55.090
he used to get this prescription diet medication there,
air quotes,

542
00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.810
diet medications,
which is fucking speed.
Right?
And look,

543
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.260
the guy has an exorbitant amount of energy.
I mean,

544
00:32:02.261 --> 00:32:06.220
it's quite impressive for a man in his seventies who eats shit.

545
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.850
His Diet doesn't exercise and he's always ready to go.
I mean,

546
00:32:09.851 --> 00:32:12.520
when he was campaigning,
he didn't seem to ever get tired.

547
00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.910
He would go and do these campaign events and he would always be talking and it'd

548
00:32:15.911 --> 00:32:18.700
be full of enthusiasm.
We're going to make America great again.

549
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.370
We've got to build that wall higher.
We're going to tell those Chinese,

550
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:25.960
listen motherfucker like he was.
I mean it's an incredible amount of energy.

551
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.410
God bless him.
He so 70 some odd years old.

552
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:32.320
It's amazing that you don't have to drug test him.
It's amazing.

553
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.140
You get trace test players,
baseball players.

554
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.860
I was going to say they're the guys we need to and what I mean,

555
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.100
what is that all is

556
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.760
<v 2>not a performance enhancing drug.
The auto percent talk to journalists.</v>

557
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:47.060
How many journalists will be totally honest about it.

558
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.660
They are fucking hooked on Adderall and they are very productive with it.

559
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:55.370
Very productive.
I tried it once.
It's wild.
Somebody gave me some,

560
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:57.590
I didn't try it.
I just sat there and looked at it and I go,

561
00:32:57.591 --> 00:32:59.630
I don't need that in my life.
I've been scared of coke.

562
00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:01.430
I've never done coke and I'd never done Adderall.

563
00:33:01.431 --> 00:33:03.830
I don't fuck with speed because I can't shut the fuck up already.

564
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:08.120
My Dad is not for me.
I need something to calms me down.
It makes me feel weird.

565
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.260
I feel like I'd be that guy who like does it.

566
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.530
The first time in my heart explodes out of my chest.

567
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.930
You'd be like scraping the off the roof with a shovel,
you know,

568
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:17.810
did because you're so high energy.
I was like,
Jesus,

569
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:22.280
I can't worry that I would love it.
That's what I'm worried.
I'm worried.

570
00:33:22.281 --> 00:33:25.810
I would love it and I'd be like,
okay,
from here on out,
it's all about May.

571
00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:30.430
You know,
we just,
marijuana does the opposite.
To me,

572
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:33.640
marijuana is like,
well,
we could all be cool together.
You know,

573
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:37.940
I finally tried pot.
Yeah.
I find finally what happened.
I never,
I never,

574
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:42.080
I never tried it before,
but you know,
I was,
I was actually,
um,
years ago,

575
00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:47.330
I was in Colorado for 20 backstage at a snoop concert.
Oh Geez.

576
00:33:47.331 --> 00:33:50.570
You have to try it.
I didn't have to because I was secondhand stone.

577
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:56.100
It's like tried it.
It's like,
it's like when I go to church with Coco,
I mean I,

578
00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.960
you're just getting into just hot docs.
You know?

579
00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.790
I literally was people's church with cocoa for people to understand what we're

580
00:34:01.791 --> 00:34:06.670
saying,
church of what's happening now.
Podcast with Joey Diaz.
I didn't,
I didn't,

581
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.311
I didn't mean that.

582
00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:10.580
I actually went to like a Santa Maria Church shouldn't sacrifice the chicken,

583
00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:12.830
although we have done that in Miami when he's out of Miami,

584
00:34:12.831 --> 00:34:15.390
all bets are off when Joey's down.
But like,
uh,

585
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:20.470
like I'm in the middle of a story on his podcast and I fucking forgot the ds at

586
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:22.940
the end of the story.
I literally,

587
00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:27.110
like I told her and I like ended it and then only the next day did I go.

588
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:30.170
I never told him the end of that story.
I fucking forgot it.

589
00:34:30.171 --> 00:34:33.590
But so someone says a snoop,
snoop wants to meet you.

590
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.620
He's in his dressing room backstage at this concert.
It's like,
Oh fuck yeah,

591
00:34:37.621 --> 00:34:38.900
I'm going to go meet snoop.
Are you kidding?

592
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.820
So I opened the door to this backstage area.
Dude,

593
00:34:43.821 --> 00:34:47.810
I can't see my hand in front of me.
I see my hand in front.

594
00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.060
It is foggy.
I like

595
00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:55.090
windshield wipers and my fucking glasses.
I can't see shit.
And I'm,

596
00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.120
I'm wandering and I got maybe halfway down the hall and I was like,
I can't,

597
00:34:59.121 --> 00:35:02.870
I can't,
I can't.
I turned around,
he bolted out the door.
I was like,

598
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.750
you know,
just panting on my hands and knees.
I was like,
I can't do I.

599
00:35:06.751 --> 00:35:09.530
So I couldn't go back until the next year,
like two years later,

600
00:35:09.531 --> 00:35:10.600
I'm back in in Colorado.

601
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.560
But because everybody was making fun of me because I like,

602
00:35:12.561 --> 00:35:15.520
you went to Colorado and didn't smoke though.

603
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.330
Like that's like going to Italy and not eating pasta,
you know?
I was like,
okay,

604
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:22.610
next time,
next time.
So I go out and I try it and I was like,

605
00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:28.520
all I kept saying was I wish I was drunk.
I wish I was drunk.

606
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:32.420
I wish I was joking.
I just,
I dunno.
It was like a bad,
I just,

607
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.120
it was so antisocial.
I felt so weird.

608
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.190
I felt so sort of introverted and it was unfortunately in like,

609
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:42.090
they have this pot smoking church in Denver.
Whoa.
Yeah.

610
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.990
It's like you go and you can just smoke pot and it's literally in this old

611
00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:48.900
church,
they got beautiful paintings on the wall.
It's crazy.
It's trippy,

612
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:53.010
and so I was there and I tried it and I was like,
how much did you smoke?

613
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:57.670
Not a lot.
Two heads.
Two,
three.
Yeah,
that's too much.
Is that too much?

614
00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:01.350
You want for lightweight?
If I was your friend,
why am your friend,

615
00:36:01.351 --> 00:36:04.250
but if I was right next to you at the time,
I'd say a little baby hit Billy.

616
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.770
Just a little baby hit.
Don't get crazy.
He's like this.
That's all.

617
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:11.460
I want this and then let's just relax.
Don't get credit.
Don't take it.

618
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:15.600
When it comes back around again,
it's too much.
It's too God damn strong today.

619
00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:20.070
It's not what it used to be.
I was in a very recently in Austin,

620
00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:24.060
Texas and Texas still has regular weed.
It's very good weed,

621
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:27.150
but it's regularly.
Well,
you could smoke it and you're like,
I'm here.

622
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.170
Everything's fine.
California no longer.
These motherfuckers right here,

623
00:36:31.171 --> 00:36:35.850
these little backwoods that Jesus that is not regular wheat that's got a glass

624
00:36:35.851 --> 00:36:37.980
tip and that will put you on the fucking moon.

625
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.230
Brian Cowen had one hit of it last week.

626
00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:43.590
He couldn't drive himself home hours later,

627
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.110
hours later he was still here hanging out.

628
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:53.240
I'm awake,
I'm awake.
He had to get my friend Brendan had come and get them.

629
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:58.280
Yeah.
Couldn't try it.
It's awesome.
It's fucking Straw.
There's lots,

630
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.980
some different shit.
So next time I did it,
I did something.
Someone said,

631
00:37:01.981 --> 00:37:05.340
you know what?
Maybe you should try something else.
Sativa versus indigo.

632
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.150
I tried it a second time.
Laugh my ass.
I was with funny friends.
Okay.

633
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:11.190
And I had a fucking blast.

634
00:37:11.191 --> 00:37:15.060
So I don't know what I did or shouldn't have done or should do or shouldn't do.

635
00:37:15.061 --> 00:37:18.900
But it was I a lot of fun.
Yeah.
Sativa is more,
um,

636
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.560
you're thinking more.
It's a little bit,
you have a little bit more energy.

637
00:37:22.561 --> 00:37:25.710
Endeca crushes you.
You just like,
Oh my God,

638
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.180
I've got to go somewhere and lay down.
I can't handle this.
It's,

639
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:32.160
but it's different for different people as well.

640
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:36.510
But I'll tell you that Chick-Filet tastes damn.
Oh,
that's way better,
right?

641
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.510
Hate tastes great.
I got to tell you,
I hate,
hate,
tastes great.

642
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.470
I mean it's my ignorance and hate,
but I see what you're saying.
Thank you.

643
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.060
I had to explain to my kids was closed on Sunday.
They were driving by.
How come?

644
00:37:48.061 --> 00:37:51.990
No one's,
there I go cause it's,
it's the baby Jesus's Day.
Okay.

645
00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:55.740
If you really want to celebrate the baby,
Jesus though is hear me out.

646
00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.300
I watch a lot of TBN because I'm a lunatic and I like,

647
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.930
I will always wonder like if the Jews were on television all the time we were on

648
00:38:03.931 --> 00:38:07.950
television going like send this money,
what would they say about us?

649
00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:09.000
But for some reason,

650
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:13.800
I don't know why Jesus needs a lot of money because they're always on TV telling

651
00:38:13.801 --> 00:38:15.330
you to send your money to Jesus.
Right?

652
00:38:15.331 --> 00:38:18.630
So I'm thinking if you really want to do something for Jesus,

653
00:38:18.631 --> 00:38:23.631
Chick-Filet open on Sunday and donate all of your revenue to Jesus,

654
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.380
to churches,
all the [inaudible] think of the money.

655
00:38:27.381 --> 00:38:31.500
Just the after church crowd alone.
Everybody would flock,
no pun intended,

656
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.100
right to the chick filet and stock up and have all their money.
They can even

657
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.690
<v 1>have people volunteer to work those days and donate all your money to Jesus</v>

658
00:38:40.691 --> 00:38:43.540
because he apparently needs,
I don't know what he needs with it,

659
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.770
but he needs a lot of money.
Well,
I don't know if the chick filet guys,

660
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:52.660
the people own it are of the same ilk as the Trinity Broadcast Network folks.

661
00:38:52.661 --> 00:38:54.130
Cause those TBN folks.

662
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.860
I don't think you're being mean by saying they're shysters.
You know,

663
00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:03.070
they're straight.
They're just,
they're just stealing money from people.

664
00:39:03.071 --> 00:39:06.910
I think that Chick-Filet guys like legitimately religious person who really

665
00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:10.750
truly believes that he's saving the world from gay folk marrying each other.

666
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.750
Yeah.
And Stop Bro.
Migraine.
It's not logical,

667
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:21.760
but they make a goddamn good chicken sandwich.
Gotcha.
Quite quite tasty.

668
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.670
And I telling you I can't.
I think it's more ignorance than hate,

669
00:39:24.671 --> 00:39:29.470
but if it doesn't rhyme,
ignorance tastes great.
But like,

670
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.760
I dunno,
at night they had this lunatic on,
he's on all the time.
They're,

671
00:39:32.761 --> 00:39:37.600
they're paid half hour shows,
but this Peter Popoff guy,

672
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.110
the fucking miracle,
springwater,
the prosperity,

673
00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:45.580
the prosperity preachers talk about a fucking bill of goods,
man.

674
00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:50.140
You know that that Guy Creflo dollar,
his name is fucking Cref.

675
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:52.830
Like I'm guessing that's not his Christian name,
but it's this,

676
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:56.420
but it's his evangelical name.
Is craft a donkey made that name up private?

677
00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:00.160
I would hope so.
That was,
that was the dude you tweeted about him years ago.

678
00:40:00.161 --> 00:40:04.330
That was the dude who was out in the world getting donations because he needed

679
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:09.331
to update or upgrade his g four to a g six and I was like,

680
00:40:10.061 --> 00:40:12.940
Jesus six Christ,
this fucking this guy.

681
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:17.620
It was going to say I need it cause I need to spread the Gospel and so you need

682
00:40:17.621 --> 00:40:20.770
to give me money so that because my g four just ain't cutting it anymore.

683
00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:21.670
I need to upgrade.

684
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:26.140
I wish she had gotten a seven 37 Max eight but that's just me.

685
00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:30.320
It's just so amazing that that hustle still works.
The,

686
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:34.570
the prosperity ones are so gross because they go after people that are so poor

687
00:40:34.571 --> 00:40:37.450
and destitute that they can't pay their bills and they tell them,

688
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:40.780
if you just send me money,
God will pay you back 10 fold.

689
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:44.140
And I know what you're saying.
You don't have any money but you do.
You do.

690
00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:45.100
You take that money,

691
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:49.840
you send it to Jesus and Jesus will bring prosperity in your life.

692
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:54.070
And then they have all these folks that are giving testimonials about how I was

693
00:40:54.071 --> 00:40:57.070
down on my luck.
I didn't have money for rent,
I didn't have money for food,

694
00:40:57.071 --> 00:40:59.110
but I knew that Jesus needed this money.

695
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:04.290
So I sent Jesus the money and Jesus paid me back 10 fold and now my life is

696
00:41:04.301 --> 00:41:07.660
filled with joy and prosperity.
Am I being hateful?

697
00:41:07.661 --> 00:41:12.661
And I say that that is what religion preys on the or the no,

698
00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:18.250
I'm searching for answers.
Yeah.
But I think for some people there's like,

699
00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:21.970
I mean this is older,
wiser me,
right?
When I was younger,

700
00:41:21.971 --> 00:41:25.750
I would agree with you 100% but I think at this point I think there's some

701
00:41:25.751 --> 00:41:30.751
benefit to like having community and having this environment where everybody

702
00:41:32.801 --> 00:41:37.280
goes to be humbled and everybody goes to agree that they're going to be good

703
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:42.110
people that file the ethics of Jesus and he put a little money in the dish and

704
00:41:42.111 --> 00:41:44.590
you know,
they have to keep the operation running and there's a lot,

705
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.730
I think there's a lot of churches that do a lot of good,

706
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.290
but I think for every one or two that do a lot of good,

707
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.980
there's these motherfuckers that are just stealing money and tribe and Rolls

708
00:41:54.981 --> 00:41:58.940
Royces,
just hypocrites.
Giant fucking castles,
you know,

709
00:41:58.941 --> 00:42:03.700
like that Joel,
whatever his name is.
What's that guy's name?
Houston.

710
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.830
That motherfucker.
He owns a shoe.
Huge arena.
He,
they,

711
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.000
they do the show in there and,

712
00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:12.800
and he caught a rash of shit when he didn't let all the hurricane victims stay

713
00:42:12.801 --> 00:42:17.300
in his place.
Yeah.
He was holed up in his $10 million mansion.

714
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:21.090
That's about days.
It was only 10 million.
You know,
it's not his only property.

715
00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:25.540
You know,
he has several houses.
It's just so distorted the,
the,

716
00:42:25.541 --> 00:42:28.850
the whole idea of it all.
So distorted it.
But I think,

717
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:33.050
I think there's a lot of community churches that do a lot of good where they

718
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.480
provide people with comfort.
I,
you know,

719
00:42:35.481 --> 00:42:39.140
it doesn't necessarily have to make any sense and it doesn't make any sense,

720
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:41.840
but it provides them with comfort.
I appreciate it.

721
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:43.760
Like I respect people of faith.

722
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:46.590
I think it must feel wonderful and I'm know how fields,

723
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:50.630
but it must be wonderful to believe in something like that.

724
00:42:50.631 --> 00:42:52.610
So devoutly without any evidence,

725
00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:57.611
without any indication or proof whatsoever that what you so firmly believe in is

726
00:42:58.671 --> 00:43:02.310
true.
But it's the hypocrisy of it that I just can't abide by it.
Right?

727
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.360
Like these prosperity guys,
uh,
like the prosperity guys,

728
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:10.480
like people who used to have a or claim to have some kind of holier than now

729
00:43:12.921 --> 00:43:17.810
moral code that now think like the pimp president's cool.
It's like I get it.

730
00:43:17.811 --> 00:43:21.500
But like your whole thing was like the Bill Clinton was the biggest scumbag in

731
00:43:21.501 --> 00:43:25.510
the world.
Right?
And He needs to be impeached and castrated.
And,
but like,

732
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.580
let's have some consistency.
It's the PA,
Chrissy,
that I can abide by.

733
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.570
What's up some consistency is all,
well,
particularly with Trump,

734
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:34.850
because Trump was a,
and this is not a knock on him,

735
00:43:34.851 --> 00:43:37.370
but he was a lifelong democrat.
I mean,

736
00:43:37.371 --> 00:43:41.360
he only really became a republican when he thought about running for president.

737
00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.250
Yeah.
And he was an independent for a minute,

738
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:46.610
and he was a Democrat again then he was Republican.
It's a pure hustle.

739
00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:47.021
I mean the,

740
00:43:47.021 --> 00:43:51.080
the glass has been cleaned and squeegeed and you could see right through it.

741
00:43:51.081 --> 00:43:54.650
That's why it works on the evangelicals.
That's what I'm saying.
It's their whole,

742
00:43:55.270 --> 00:44:00.140
he's the pimp Joel Osteen.
Like,
he's like,
that's what it is.
Well,

743
00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.200
he found his hustle.
Yeah.
And I don't want to be mean about this,

744
00:44:03.201 --> 00:44:04.820
but I think it's accurate that there's,

745
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:09.940
there's a level of intellect that just subscribes to that kind of stuff.

746
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:13.610
That like I had a friend,

747
00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:18.320
she was in the Mormon church for a long time and she left the church,

748
00:44:18.321 --> 00:44:20.540
but she was really honest about it.
She said,

749
00:44:20.541 --> 00:44:24.080
I have a problem that I'm susceptible to bullshit.

750
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.320
Like she suscept because she grew up a fundamentalist.

751
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:32.520
And so she's susceptible to,
you know,
to like type people,

752
00:44:32.521 --> 00:44:36.840
like a ruse crystals and the,
the lights feeling light.

753
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.950
She's susceptible to all that shit.
And she would recognize her susceptibility,

754
00:44:40.951 --> 00:44:44.130
but she was being really honest about it.
You know,
that she's like,

755
00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:45.240
I have a real problem.

756
00:44:45.241 --> 00:44:48.720
I grew up believing something that doesn't make any sense and I believed it

757
00:44:48.721 --> 00:44:50.280
wholeheartedly.
And she goes,

758
00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:55.281
and that sort of formulated a big part of how I ascertain what is accurate in

759
00:44:56.371 --> 00:44:57.870
the world.
So she's left with,

760
00:44:57.871 --> 00:45:02.871
he's like child likes skills of being able to discern what's bullshit and what's

761
00:45:06.031 --> 00:45:07.920
a hustle.
She's like a little kid.

762
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:12.510
I have a great amount of respect for people who grow up in a cult and who can

763
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.800
make their way out of it.
I mean,
can you imagine when you're a child,

764
00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:21.660
you're most impressionable and,
and you're steeped in that.
That's all,
you know,

765
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.530
like you don't know that there is an alternate perspective and uh,

766
00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.920
and you're able to grow up and say,
oh wait,

767
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:33.480
there's a whole big world out there.
Maybe I'm not being told the truth.

768
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.860
I'd that's incredibly powerful.

769
00:45:34.861 --> 00:45:39.330
It's really hard I think for it to break with the only thinking that you've ever

770
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:41.670
known in your life.
I think it's amazing.
It's one of the,

771
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.370
probably one of the hardest things that a grown adult has to do.

772
00:45:44.371 --> 00:45:47.850
So recognize that the paradigm,
this,
this,
this framework,

773
00:45:47.851 --> 00:45:52.080
they've been living their life under his auto utter horse shit.
It's like,

774
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:56.300
I mean the Mormon want is so crazy too cause it's like the,

775
00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.460
the results are great.
The people are so nice.

776
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.310
They're the nicest cult members of all times.

777
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.910
But then you go back and look at the actual framework of the religion itself.

778
00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:10.440
You're like,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.
He was 14 he like hold on.

779
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.630
Joseph Smith was 14 and 18,

780
00:46:12.631 --> 00:46:17.631
20 when he found golden tablets that contain the loss work of Jesus and only he

781
00:46:17.671 --> 00:46:19.680
could read them cause he had a magic rock.

782
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:24.950
But like that's Judaism and Catholicism.
It's all there.
All the guys,

783
00:46:24.951 --> 00:46:28.320
he mythological horseshit,
but they know who the guy was like,
I mean,

784
00:46:28.321 --> 00:46:31.640
he's so recent.
Too Real.
It's too well,
that's the thing,
is it?
No,

785
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:34.260
it's like Scientology.
It's like,
yes.
Well we know it's a lie.

786
00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:37.830
Psychology's even crazy science fiction writer.
Literally,

787
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.070
you failed a failed science picture.
Writeable writer,

788
00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.370
terrible failed science fiction writer.
Damn.

789
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:47.850
Mother fucker never made a second draft in his life and one day said the,

790
00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:52.200
if you want to make real money,
start a religion,
that is his greatest quote.
Yeah.

791
00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:55.650
And they did it and got it.
Some can't knock his hustle.

792
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:57.630
People want to buy into that.

793
00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:02.800
It's amazing how 2019 it's still rocking some lesson.

794
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:07.560
I mean,
it is.
Even after all those documentaries,
even after the Leah Remini show,

795
00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.600
all these things just,
they go out in the world,

796
00:47:09.601 --> 00:47:10.980
they tell everybody it's horse shit.

797
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:15.120
And then a brand new Scientology center opens in Miami.
I'm like,
seriously hilly.

798
00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:18.720
We know we are in New Orleans opened.
We already know.
Some people don't know.

799
00:47:18.721 --> 00:47:22.260
The people don't know are never gonna know.
That's what it is.

800
00:47:22.261 --> 00:47:27.060
It's like you're going,
if you know,
if you want to put it in a money to it,

801
00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:32.090
like some people have $100 some people $5 and this is like intellectually.

802
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:37.150
Some people have a lot of room to work with.
Some people don't.

803
00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:39.700
They just,
their brain doesn't work as good.

804
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.330
Just like some people have poor genetics when it comes to their ability to run

805
00:47:43.331 --> 00:47:47.770
fast.
Some people have really shitty brain development genetics

806
00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:52.560
<v 2>because obviously you would have sympathy for someone who was taken advantage of</v>

807
00:47:52.561 --> 00:47:55.560
her swinging old,
the official up a con con person.

808
00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:02.180
How much sympathy do you have for the gleefully ignorant or the willfully

809
00:48:02.881 --> 00:48:05.910
ignorant meaning like the information is there.
It's available.

810
00:48:05.911 --> 00:48:10.140
Before I give Scientology my money,
I could just,
I don't know,
Google it.

811
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:14.670
How much sympathy do you have for like the willfully ignorant people who,

812
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:17.730
who sort of,
it's,
it's like the fucking dude from my airplane.

813
00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.520
They bought their tickets,
they knew what they were getting into.

814
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.520
I say let them crash,
you know,
like,
well,

815
00:48:23.521 --> 00:48:27.210
I'm a big fan of Willie d from the Geto boys and he has a quote that I always

816
00:48:27.211 --> 00:48:29.730
like to use.
You got to let a hoby a Ho.

817
00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:35.490
<v 1>And I think in that sense,
like you gotta let Dummies get fleeced.</v>

818
00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:39.000
It's just part of,
and part of it is there for us to see.

819
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:43.710
Part of it is there for you to go,
what?
They gave away all their money.
Ah,
Shit.

820
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:47.400
Like there's something to that.
That's it.
It benefits us.

821
00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:52.140
Like I'm not a fan of these videos where kids tried to skate board off the side

822
00:48:52.141 --> 00:48:55.530
of a building and they slip and fall and land on their head and everybody's
like,

823
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:59.850
Oh shit.
But,
but those videos serve a purpose.

824
00:48:59.851 --> 00:49:03.420
And that purpose is not everybody gets to do the hands down on the side of the

825
00:49:03.421 --> 00:49:04.620
building and survive.
Right.

826
00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:07.410
Some people fall in the land on their fucking head and they're never the same

827
00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:08.190
again.

828
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:12.240
And then they're left with like a third grader's Iq for the rest of their life.

829
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:13.520
That's real man.
So

830
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:15.260
<v 2>George Carlin's bit about,
you know,</v>

831
00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:19.040
the kid who swallows the most marbles doesn't get to grow up and have kids of

832
00:49:19.041 --> 00:49:19.410
his own.

833
00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:24.300
<v 1>That's how it's supposed to work.
Unfortunately it sucks if it's your kid.</v>

834
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:30.920
It's all of us are experiencing this life together and there's some folks that

835
00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:33.180
are just,
they're going to do a shitty job of it.

836
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:37.560
And part of me thinks that because there is no utopia,
right?

837
00:49:37.561 --> 00:49:39.870
There is no enlightened people.

838
00:49:39.871 --> 00:49:43.890
There's no one civilization that's got it all nailed and everybody gets along

839
00:49:43.891 --> 00:49:48.630
together and everyone's totally fine with every single choice everybody makes

840
00:49:48.631 --> 00:49:51.690
cause everybody ever been to a waffle house.
That's a utopia.

841
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:55.740
It's close depending on how drunk you are.
Because of that,

842
00:49:55.741 --> 00:49:57.960
I think we operate under this,
uh,

843
00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:02.990
this weird system where you've got to see the failures in order to recognize

844
00:50:03.241 --> 00:50:04.260
that failure is possible.

845
00:50:04.261 --> 00:50:09.261
I think there's these actual community benefit to people fucking up and there's

846
00:50:09.451 --> 00:50:11.910
some community benefit to people getting fleeced.

847
00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.140
<v 2>Listen,
I always say that,
first of all,</v>

848
00:50:15.141 --> 00:50:19.700
I don't believe anybody that says any artist or anybody out out in the world

849
00:50:19.701 --> 00:50:23.150
creating something and putting it out there for people to react to it.

850
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:26.030
I don't believe anyone who says they don't read their reviews.

851
00:50:26.031 --> 00:50:26.870
So their own reviews.

852
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:32.050
I read all of the reviews and I read the bad ones twice cause that's where you

853
00:50:33.381 --> 00:50:35.960
learn the most.
They could be right,
that could be wrong.

854
00:50:35.961 --> 00:50:38.660
But I feel like you just,

855
00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:43.970
it's where you fuck up that like you,
you learn the most from it.
And,

856
00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:47.930
and I think I feel like as a white man in America all the time,

857
00:50:47.931 --> 00:50:50.540
I have to keep myself in check the way you were describing earlier about how

858
00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:51.770
like you know what,

859
00:50:51.771 --> 00:50:55.190
if you just come to realize that maybe the world isn't exactly the way you

860
00:50:55.191 --> 00:50:58.340
perceive it and that maybe there's a lot of other people who have very different

861
00:50:58.341 --> 00:51:00.050
experiences from the ones that you have.

862
00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:04.160
And so maybe the reality of the world is different for those people and you can

863
00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:07.730
be a more enlightened person by being more empathetic and trying to understand

864
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:12.050
those perspectives.
Trying to walk a mile in their shoes.
And I just feel like

865
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.910
I've learned so much more from the mistakes that I've made in the failures that

866
00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:20.780
I've had certainly than any of the successes I,
I have in my home.
I have no,

867
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.020
I have movie posters,
but they're like Arthur,
other people's movies,
you know,

868
00:51:24.021 --> 00:51:27.440
I have none of my own movie posters at home.
That's,
that's,
that's at the office.

869
00:51:27.441 --> 00:51:30.650
That's not what home is for.
You know,
except I had one for awhile.

870
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:36.130
I had one poster of one of my movies that I hung in the bathroom over the toilet

871
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.610
cause it was the,

872
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:41.390
my least favorite and I just wanted to be reminded every like that,

873
00:51:41.391 --> 00:51:44.480
that was the time I took a shit,
you know,
like for the whole world to see.

874
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.920
And I hung it over.
It's either for a number of years,
it's not there anymore.

875
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:52.790
But like I just,
I just,
I wanted to remind myself of it.
You know,

876
00:51:52.791 --> 00:51:55.520
you're a smart guy.
You take motivation and failures.

877
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:59.420
I mean that's what failures are really good for.
When you fail at something,

878
00:51:59.421 --> 00:52:03.110
there's,
there's a benefit to that and that you,
you go,
God that sucked.

879
00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.560
I don't ever want to suck again.
Like let me figure out a way to not suck.

880
00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:11.210
Like I always say that with about comics.
Like when we bomb,
that is,

881
00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:12.260
it's a terrible feeling,

882
00:52:12.261 --> 00:52:16.640
but it's the best opportunity for growth because you realize like,
Hey,
I,

883
00:52:16.641 --> 00:52:18.530
I obviously didn't do a good job.

884
00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:22.430
I need to figure out what the fuck I did wrong and battened down the hatches and

885
00:52:22.431 --> 00:52:25.610
get this ship right.
Cause I can't experience that again.

886
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:30.290
I became a comedy fan in no small part because I had been to shows where I've

887
00:52:30.291 --> 00:52:34.370
seen some of the biggest funniest guys bomb.

888
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:40.240
And unlike Jesus short of being a soldier or a cop or like a stunt man,

889
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:46.160
this is one of the most dangerous self-destructive jobs.
Like it's,

890
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:51.190
it requires such bravery and such strength of soul and thickness of skin that

891
00:52:52.731 --> 00:52:57.500
like I went fucking Vegas,
it's like 2000,
um,

892
00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:03.220
and saw Carlin big beautiful room sat like front row.

893
00:53:03.981 --> 00:53:06.080
It was weird cause like the stage was like a wall.

894
00:53:06.081 --> 00:53:09.890
Like I was sitting against like the fucking stage and I had to look up and like

895
00:53:09.891 --> 00:53:13.300
Carlin shoe would like pass like right in front of my eyes just above my,

896
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:14.180
my eyeline.

897
00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:19.180
And he was doing material for one of his last specials and it was the one I

898
00:53:19.311 --> 00:53:20.330
think might,
might even the second to last.

899
00:53:20.331 --> 00:53:23.210
He had that whole bit about like he doesn't believe in God,

900
00:53:23.211 --> 00:53:28.211
but like he believes in like shit he can see and he's afraid of like the Saunder

901
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:29.940
Joe Peshy line,
you know,
that whole bit.

902
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:34.260
And he was in this big old God fearing crowd there in La and in Las Vegas.

903
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:38.250
And they were not about this.
They were not about it.
Not One I odor,

904
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:41.700
not one little bit.
And he's trucking back and forth doing it.

905
00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.650
Fucking crickets.

906
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:49.100
Fucking crickets packed house sold out on the only one laughing in the room,

907
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:56.270
just me in this giant room and I'm laughing at my ass off and I'm all by myself

908
00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:59.820
and I'm,
I at some point I turned,

909
00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:03.210
I stopped laughing long enough or took a breath to take a drink.
Right.

910
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:04.770
I don't look down.

911
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:08.760
And then I looked back up at the stage and Carlin is right there.

912
00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:13.570
He's like hunched over with his head,
like dangling off the stage,
like practice.

913
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:16.560
And I look up and I'm practically nose to nose with Carlin and he goes,

914
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:17.490
thank you sir.

915
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:22.410
And just walks away and keep stalking the set the stage.

916
00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:27.100
And I was like,
oh my God.
And I saw,
I was at the Improv.
Um,

917
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:32.410
I it Miami when they,
when they had the one at the number of the,
the hard route,

918
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:36.560
the hard rock,
I guess they're redoing it or whatever,
or fucking places,
death.

919
00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:41.580
I was like,
I was like,
man,
you know,
they say,
what did they say?

920
00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:44.820
How rocks the floor though?
That's the Hollywood one though.
Yeah.
Hollywood.

921
00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:49.110
The Hollywood Seminole.
Oh yeah,
it was good.
The bad one was Miami,

922
00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:53.700
the Miami and the growth.
That was,
that was rough.
Yeah.
But,
but the,

923
00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:56.100
but the,
no,
it was cool.
But then now it's got like,

924
00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.170
they bulldoze the whole fucking place.

925
00:54:58.171 --> 00:55:01.600
They're supposed to be remodeling and rebuilding it.
The Seminole hard rock.
Like,

926
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.040
it's like,
I always say,
you know,
what's the saying that like,
um,
uh,

927
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.090
in a casino the house always wins.
I'm like,

928
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:12.690
these Indian casinos are the only place where like the house never wins.

929
00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:14.610
Cause doesn't matter how much money you lose there.

930
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:16.800
We still like rape their women and stole their country.

931
00:55:16.801 --> 00:55:20.490
So like the least you could do is like drop a little coin at the Indian casino.

932
00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:21.810
And that's what I would do.
I'd go play.
They,

933
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:24.730
that was the only place that is the only place they had blackjack,
uh,

934
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:27.240
in south Florida.
So you can go there and play blackjack,

935
00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:29.430
but they bulldoze the Improv.
And I was there one night,

936
00:55:29.431 --> 00:55:34.170
Gilbert Godfried was there and I was literally the only person laughing,

937
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.760
but like in pain,

938
00:55:35.761 --> 00:55:40.530
like I was in pain laughing and it was just brutal.
And like,

939
00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:44.490
and I've been in these rooms were like these guys and,
and I was just like,

940
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:48.390
these are the funniest people that I know.
And it's happened time and time again.

941
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.690
And I've been just shows where they killed and I've been to shows where they

942
00:55:51.691 --> 00:55:55.960
died and I was like,
this is amazing.
This is so amazing.
It's like the,

943
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:59.970
if the fact that anybody gets back on stage after that,

944
00:55:59.971 --> 00:56:04.020
after a night like that is just,
it's remarkable to me.
I have nothing.

945
00:56:04.021 --> 00:56:07.020
I have such respect for that.

946
00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.810
I want to say the bomb and is like sucking a thousand Dick's in front of your

947
00:56:09.811 --> 00:56:10.644
mother,

948
00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:14.490
but not really because somewhere out there there's a guy who loves sucking a

949
00:56:14.491 --> 00:56:18.900
dick in front of his mother.
And if you put another 999,

950
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:20.250
he wouldn't be that sad.

951
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.130
But no one wants a bomb

952
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.400
<v 1>in front of their mother.
No one wants a bomb period.
It's just terrible.</v>

953
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:30.850
It's a ruthless experience.
It's,
um,
it's,

954
00:56:30.851 --> 00:56:35.680
it's just a rips you down and in shreds all your self worth,

955
00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:38.830
it makes you feel terrible.
But again,

956
00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:43.540
some of my best growth periods in my career have come after eating shit.

957
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.370
It just,
you spike,
it didn't realize you've go to go,
got to go to work.

958
00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:49.510
You can't be complacent.

959
00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:53.170
And that's one of the things that fuels and motivates me to this day.

960
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:56.290
I'm terrified of bombing,
so I'll just keep,

961
00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:59.830
it's anything I can use to make me work harder.

962
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:04.860
I use the six years since I did my shittiest work had been like for me

963
00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:10.610
artistically,
creatively,
uh,
the most productive.
And like I,

964
00:57:10.611 --> 00:57:15.611
I feel finally after 20 years of making documentaries that I might be doing like

965
00:57:17.771 --> 00:57:18.760
my best work,
like,

966
00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:22.960
but it took that fucking long and it took basically almost six years from

967
00:57:22.961 --> 00:57:25.870
totally bombing,
you know,
to,
for me to feel like I,

968
00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:30.460
I hit rock bottom and then have spiked,
you know,
better than better than before.

969
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:35.500
You've done some documentaries with some dangerous people in them.
You know,

970
00:57:35.501 --> 00:57:39.250
obviously Griselda Blanco is probably one of the most dangerous people on earth

971
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:43.000
while she was alive.
Um,
and in this,

972
00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:44.770
you also touch on that.

973
00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:49.300
I mean there's a lot of these people are fucking sketchy folks and you're

974
00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:53.260
exposing how stupid their activity.
Where does that,

975
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:56.200
does that ever creep you out?
If we get nervous,
like,

976
00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:59.950
cause you're making these documentaries mocking these people and you know,

977
00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:02.220
rightly so.
But it's uh,

978
00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.960
not cocaine cow was when really marketing is more exposing.

979
00:58:04.961 --> 00:58:08.500
But this one is like openly mocking.
This one's really good man.

980
00:58:08.501 --> 00:58:12.540
It's really funny.
And it comes out March 29th.
Yes,
sir.
Friday.
Yeah.
And uh,
uh,

981
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:15.730
April 5th on Vod.
Mm.
Yeah.
Well this one's,

982
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:20.710
this one's tough because this is like a fresh wound from Netflix.
March.
No Vod,

983
00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:25.150
I'm sorry.
Theaters March 29th and Vod,
April fet.
So like Itunes,

984
00:58:25.151 --> 00:58:28.450
Amazon review on your cable box kind of release.

985
00:58:28.451 --> 00:58:32.170
You're going to get into theaters.
I'm starting off with 12 cities on Friday,

986
00:58:32.171 --> 00:58:35.620
the 29th and then,
I mean it's an island.
Oh yeah,
for sure.

987
00:58:35.621 --> 00:58:40.450
At the Lenley Music Hall.
Oh,
three grand.
Um,
and then,

988
00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:44.740
uh,
where else?
I think San Francisco,
Boston,

989
00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:48.220
Miami,
Orlando.
Um,

990
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:52.360
if there's like 12 cities and that I guess depending on how well it does a,

991
00:58:52.361 --> 00:58:55.290
it's being put out by Greenwich Entertainment who just won the Oscar for free

992
00:58:55.291 --> 00:58:58.960
sell low for best documentary so they know what they're doing and,
and uh,

993
00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:02.500
like I said,
hopefully people will go see it and listen to it.

994
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:05.470
I hope it's a comedy.
I think it's common.
It's a common,

995
00:59:05.471 --> 00:59:07.630
we tried to make it how was laughing my ass off?

996
00:59:07.631 --> 00:59:11.470
I was doing chin ups and laughing.
I was like,
what the fuck man,

997
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:15.370
that fucking guy.
The,
the,
the Tanner,
what's his name again?
Porter for sure.

998
00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:17.650
Porter.
That guy.
Like what?

999
00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:21.290
I just imagine if you got one of those guys in your life and he's just stuck in

1000
00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:22.400
your life and like,
Shit,

1001
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.500
<v 2>how do I get this fucking guy out of my life?</v>

1002
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:29.360
And the fact that he borrowed money from this guy and then did loan him money

1003
00:59:29.361 --> 00:59:32.060
will loan money to this guy.
Yeah.
Porter loaned it to Tony.
Yeah.

1004
00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:36.140
Tony borrowed money for a sorter and then didn't pay him.

1005
00:59:36.141 --> 00:59:37.670
And that's what caused this whole thing.

1006
00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.970
It is Alex Rodriguez has gotta be pulling his fucking hair out,
going,

1007
00:59:40.971 --> 00:59:44.930
what in the fuck?
And Alex was paying everybody.
So it was the MLB,

1008
00:59:44.931 --> 00:59:49.931
I mean everyone was running a muck in Miami like just by hiring private

1009
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:53.180
investigators running people down.
Alex Rodriguez,
actually,

1010
00:59:53.181 --> 00:59:55.670
this is an in the documentary,
but,
um,

1011
00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.880
when these convicted felons stole the stolen documents from Porter Fisher who

1012
01:00:02.721 --> 01:00:06.970
had stolen the documents from Tony Bosch,
they set him up in this whole

1013
01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:12.470
fucking tanning salon heist where they're like,
hey,

1014
01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:15.070
why don't you go in and try this new spray tan color?

1015
01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.900
It's trumpy and orange goes,
go try it on.

1016
01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.750
And while he's in the fucking spray tan machine,

1017
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:24.050
they opened his car and steal these documents,

1018
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:27.620
which has had these client lists of all these famous baseball players,

1019
01:00:27.621 --> 01:00:30.020
including the highest paid baseball player in the world,
a ride.

1020
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:35.230
And so they steal it and then they turn around and sell these stolen documents

1021
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:39.680
to major league baseball for cash.

1022
01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:44.330
Some MLB has this rag tag band of misfits,
these,

1023
01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:48.440
this internal FBI like their own internal investigations division that they

1024
01:00:48.441 --> 01:00:52.510
created after the balco,
uh,
steroid scandal.
They're running amuck.

1025
01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:56.960
They are seducing nurses,
former nurses from Tony Bossis clinics.

1026
01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:02.200
They are literally in diners with convicted felons handing over bags of cash

1027
01:01:03.051 --> 01:01:05.150
from some MLB slush fund.

1028
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:09.860
I don't imagine that we're going to 10 99 the guy and I don't know where this

1029
01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:14.390
cash came from,
125 grand.
And what they did was this,

1030
01:01:14.391 --> 01:01:19.391
that the felon who was doing it had a buddy at a neighboring table at this diner

1031
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:25.040
with his cell phone recording video recording this transaction.

1032
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:28.970
And then he turned around and went to Aa rods camp and said,

1033
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I'll sell you a video of me selling known stolen documents.

1034
01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.840
Everybody knew these documents were stolen.

1035
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:37.670
Jan will be buying these tool in records,

1036
01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.070
stolen evidence and the state of Florida,

1037
01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:43.070
Department of Health investigation for cash from a felon.

1038
01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:48.560
At some point he gets like freaked out and nervous and he deletes this video off

1039
01:01:48.561 --> 01:01:50.870
the hard drive.
He winds up selling a rod,

1040
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:54.500
a blank hard drive for six figures.
Okay.

1041
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:56.840
And a rod sends this hard drive,
he rods,

1042
01:01:56.841 --> 01:02:01.310
people send this hard drive around the world to like data recovery services to

1043
01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:02.540
try to get this video back.

1044
01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:07.310
So unfortunately the felon didn't get his second six figure payment because that

1045
01:02:07.311 --> 01:02:11.210
was,
that was the first six figures were against the recovery of the debt.

1046
01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:14.720
But he got like two,
300 grand to sell a rod,

1047
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:19.260
a blank hard drive erodes dropping money on private investigators who like

1048
01:02:19.261 --> 01:02:22.380
having car chases through South Miami.
Um,

1049
01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:26.580
it was just totally crazy and it's like I always say like,

1050
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:30.030
you come down to the swamp and roll around,
you're going to get some mud on you.

1051
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:34.920
So when MLB came down to Miami,
one of the guy,
Jerome Hill,

1052
01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:37.990
the,
the former Baltimore cop turned,
uh,

1053
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:40.740
Florida Department of Health investigator.
He,

1054
01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:45.770
he says unequivocally that majorly baseballs investigators broke the law in the

1055
01:02:45.841 --> 01:02:49.410
state of Florida and should have been prosecuted for it and held accountable for

1056
01:02:49.411 --> 01:02:51.650
it and never and never were.
I mean,

1057
01:02:51.651 --> 01:02:54.240
it's good to be a multi billion dollar monopoly.

1058
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:58.830
How old was a rod when the scandal broke a rug was definitely towards the end of

1059
01:02:58.831 --> 01:03:02.850
his career.
And so that's the interesting thing about,
because let's be real,

1060
01:03:02.851 --> 01:03:04.470
I don't give a shit about steroids in baseball.

1061
01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:09.500
And this era of steroids in baseball was not the same as the other,
you know,

1062
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:13.380
the Barry bonds,
you know,
kind of era of steroids in baseball.
Um,

1063
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:14.970
these were not guys,
you know,

1064
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.580
with next the size of my waist or anything like micro dose.

1065
01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:22.470
There are micro dosing and it was HGH and testosterone.
And a lot of these guys,

1066
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.410
I mean,
listen,
they're,
their,

1067
01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:29.010
their livelihoods are contingent upon their physical performance.
Yes.

1068
01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:33.720
And so you got to play like,
what is it,
162 games in 180 days.

1069
01:03:33.721 --> 01:03:37.290
It's the most physically grueling schedule of any of the,
uh,

1070
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:40.500
of the professional sports.
And guys have always been looking for an edge.

1071
01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:41.340
In the 1950s,

1072
01:03:41.341 --> 01:03:44.650
the Yankees were going out the Copacabana all fucking night apparently.
Okay.

1073
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:47.130
Here's an Adderall issue with baseball as well.
Absolutely.

1074
01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:51.040
A disproportionate number of baseball players compared to the general population

1075
01:03:51.041 --> 01:03:54.330
are on Adderall.
That's,
that's why I said it's a performance enhancing drug.

1076
01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:58.140
But you had guys like Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford and Billy Martin partying

1077
01:03:58.141 --> 01:04:01.290
all night at the Copa Cabana.
They have to make a 1:00 PM game,

1078
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:04.050
maybe even a double header.
They're doing greenies,
they're doing amphetamines.

1079
01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:07.320
It's always been a part of,
of of baseballs finding that edge.

1080
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:12.480
Now you got guys who are just looking to maybe recover a little faster,

1081
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:17.460
you know,
from,
from injuries or fatigue.
You're looking for guys who,
um,
are,
are,

1082
01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:22.520
are looking to maintain peak performance for a longer period than,

1083
01:04:22.801 --> 01:04:25.620
than their bodies might have otherwise allowed.
Um,

1084
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:31.170
is it that big of a deal?
I Dunno.
It's not,
and it's,
it's,
it's a weird deal.

1085
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.050
It's a weird thing that we have an issue with.
Like you've look,

1086
01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.890
if they did the same sort of stringent testing with NFL players,

1087
01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:41.420
you'd find out that everyone's on stones.
That's just a fact.

1088
01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.490
You don't get people that big and they do catch him every now and then.

1089
01:04:44.491 --> 01:04:46.170
But I feel like it's like one of those things where like,

1090
01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:48.030
you know how the drug cartels,

1091
01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:52.800
they'll let some trug drug shipments get busted so the other ones will get

1092
01:04:52.801 --> 01:04:55.340
through.
I almost feel like that's what they do with,

1093
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:59.370
with NFL players to get caught.
Like,
oh look,
we could,
we were testing,

1094
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:02.550
we got somebody to,
that's what,
that's what this was with a rod.
You know,

1095
01:05:02.551 --> 01:05:07.470
bud Seelig is the steroid commissioner.
Full Stop.
That's the bottom line.

1096
01:05:07.471 --> 01:05:10.590
His tenure was marked by the famous,
you know,

1097
01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.330
Barry Upon Derby or Mark Warren.
Sammy Sosa.
Absolutely.

1098
01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:17.280
So he

1099
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:20.410
<v 1>knowingly,
I believe,
um,</v>

1100
01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:24.970
exploited and profited from that era of baseball that really saves them after 94

1101
01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:26.150
players strike.
I mean baseball,

1102
01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:30.640
look at the size of those guys where they started.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1103
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:34.810
I mean so many of them,
they literally more familiar documentary.

1104
01:05:34.811 --> 01:05:37.320
We morph them from like a,
before an afternoon.

1105
01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:41.050
Cause there I think that they turn into fucking baseball monsters,

1106
01:05:41.051 --> 01:05:43.280
snacking balls to Guantanamo for Christ.
Hey,

1107
01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:47.050
what's interesting to me is as some people recovered from that stuff and some

1108
01:05:47.051 --> 01:05:50.230
people did not.
Jose Canseco never recovered.

1109
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:54.940
He never recovered in the public eye does and that's why he's so pissed.

1110
01:05:54.941 --> 01:05:57.040
Like that's why the ad,
it's fucked up when you're,

1111
01:05:57.041 --> 01:05:59.080
when you're the pioneer in something people really,

1112
01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:03.400
and due date they had a street named after him in Miami and they quietly took

1113
01:06:03.401 --> 01:06:06.640
that shit down in the middle of the night after decades of naming that street

1114
01:06:06.641 --> 01:06:10.480
firm.
He was just totally humiliated and think it's also because he ratted out.

1115
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:15.510
A lot of guys today ride a Rod Leete names to try to distract or diffuse.

1116
01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.490
But he didn't put out a book.
Yeah,

1117
01:06:18.491 --> 01:06:23.170
but like it's the public nature of can't Seikos book.
It's like,
I don't know,

1118
01:06:23.171 --> 01:06:24.420
I'm just guessing,
but he's,

1119
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:29.520
his book was like his book turned out to be like the way they can say goes book

1120
01:06:29.651 --> 01:06:32.710
about stories turned out to be like the Steele dossier of baseball.

1121
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.440
It's like everybody thinks is pissed and thinks is a bunch of bullshit and then

1122
01:06:35.441 --> 01:06:38.780
over time it slowly proven true and at the end there's a pee tape.
Yes.

1123
01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.320
I think that therefore holds well that's,

1124
01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:43.180
that is a good way of looking at it too.
Right?

1125
01:06:43.181 --> 01:06:47.770
Because like think about the outrage when Clinton got his dick sucked by Monica

1126
01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:49.570
Lewinsky and compare it to Donald Trump.

1127
01:06:49.571 --> 01:06:53.800
Haven't at least two women that we know about where he paid off the fucked and

1128
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:57.860
people are like,
Eh,
as the evangelicals where those stand and all that,
eh,

1129
01:06:58.050 --> 01:07:02.670
let them,
it was before the man found Christ.
That's when a lot of them say,

1130
01:07:02.671 --> 01:07:03.491
do you find Christ?

1131
01:07:03.491 --> 01:07:07.180
And I was watching a documentary where there was a guy who was,
uh,
some,

1132
01:07:07.181 --> 01:07:10.420
some Christian Guy who was saying this,

1133
01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:15.570
all of these accusations or before he was born because he was born in the eyes

1134
01:07:16.721 --> 01:07:18.790
of Christ when he accepted Christ into his life,

1135
01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.590
I guess when he's running for president,
decided 20 paid off store me.
Yeah.

1136
01:07:23.591 --> 01:07:27.700
But like the night before the,
but after that,
then it became Jesus the after.

1137
01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:31.060
So after he left,
oh,
paid off stormy.
Like when,

1138
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:32.860
when did he pick the day before the election.

1139
01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:37.120
I feel bad for her too because I feel like she thought like,

1140
01:07:37.121 --> 01:07:38.680
this is just going to go all in on this.

1141
01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:42.100
And then she lost the court case against him.
So she owes his legal fees.

1142
01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:44.040
300 grand.
He was crazy.
Like,

1143
01:07:44.041 --> 01:07:47.560
what the fuck is she going to get that and now she's trying to do stand up.
Yeah.

1144
01:07:47.561 --> 01:07:51.400
I mean that's a lot.
What I end jobs,
um,

1145
01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:56.650
she's on her craft.
She was trying to do standup,
I think.
No she's not.

1146
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:58.780
Yes she is in Houston,
Texas.

1147
01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:03.920
They were calling the her the queen of clap back.
I that is lean of the clap.
No,

1148
01:08:03.921 --> 01:08:06.740
no,
no.
Clap back.
Oh,
okay.
You know like clap back.
Like she said,

1149
01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.140
say something bad about her.

1150
01:08:08.141 --> 01:08:13.141
She's going to come after you even worst that clap back expression like someone,

1151
01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:17.660
Kim Kardashians claps back the critics like,
like that is the dumbest,

1152
01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.600
I cannot wait for that one to fucking dry up and go away.

1153
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:23.390
Not Kim Kardashians that,
that expression like Twitter,

1154
01:08:23.391 --> 01:08:26.600
insult comic kind of Shtick.
Clap back.

1155
01:08:26.601 --> 01:08:29.360
They're calling it when someone has something to say about someone saying

1156
01:08:29.361 --> 01:08:31.430
something about them that's clapping back.
Right.

1157
01:08:31.431 --> 01:08:33.960
But how does that translate to stormy Daniels doing standup?

1158
01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.990
How can you do stand up out of clap backs?
Well,

1159
01:08:35.991 --> 01:08:38.540
they were calling her the queen of clap back that she's going to do stand up

1160
01:08:38.541 --> 01:08:43.370
again.
I mean,
who knows?
Maybe she's hilarious.
She's going to take it seriously.

1161
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:46.590
I mean you never fucking know.
I mean,
as a comic I,
I,

1162
01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:51.190
I leave the door open for all possibilities,
but being,

1163
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:56.300
it just means to me that she got this situation where she thought she probably

1164
01:08:56.301 --> 01:08:58.820
was told by everybody,
look,
hey,
you're going to win this.

1165
01:08:58.821 --> 01:09:00.470
He's going to pay you off.
You're going to,

1166
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:04.400
everyone's going to know that you told the truth and people are going to pay for

1167
01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:08.420
your interviews and man,
but this is America is broke.

1168
01:09:08.421 --> 01:09:11.450
Supply and demand economy.
Like if she could make more money,

1169
01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:15.110
standup comedy's hard work.
If she can make more money just spinning on a pole.

1170
01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:18.260
Yeah,
but like why?
Cause she's got probably got bad hips.

1171
01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:20.690
She's like in her 50s or something.
Isn't Ching?
I don't know.

1172
01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:26.360
She's the older lady,
but she's not young man.

1173
01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:28.400
You know,
she's not young.

1174
01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:35.510
Hell she that she's only 40 oh Jesus.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Stormy.

1175
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:37.880
Don't clap back at me.

1176
01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:45.410
I thought she was older,
hard life ideas meal.

1177
01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.490
As we say in my hard life,
Bro.
It's just,
um,
it's just,

1178
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:53.660
but that thing is that we,
everyone's so used to it now.

1179
01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:57.680
It's like not that big a deal.
It's like even if a new accusation came out,

1180
01:09:57.681 --> 01:09:59.570
people would be like,
ah,
like,

1181
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:02.810
like do remember the New York Times report about Trump?

1182
01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:06.890
We're talking about a shady business dealings and they thought I spent years

1183
01:10:06.891 --> 01:10:07.724
rear-ender yeah,

1184
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:12.530
totally didn't do a damn thing in and out just off his shoulder.

1185
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:15.960
It's problematic.
And I'll tell you why.
Um,

1186
01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:20.320
it's what I call the,
the new American values.
It's to me what,

1187
01:10:20.321 --> 01:10:23.360
what I think screw ball is about in the end.
Meaning like,
yeah,

1188
01:10:23.361 --> 01:10:27.830
it's fun and it's funny and it's a forest.
It's a romp.
Uh,
you laugh.

1189
01:10:27.831 --> 01:10:31.100
But I think that there's a conversation to be had about what I call the new

1190
01:10:31.101 --> 01:10:35.360
American values,
which are lie,
cheat,

1191
01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:38.480
and steal and be,
get rich or get ahead.

1192
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:42.860
And these are values that we're teaching our children now,

1193
01:10:42.861 --> 01:10:45.950
not honesty,
integrity,
tell the truth.

1194
01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:49.970
Do onto others as you'd had done a hunter,
you have the golden rule on,

1195
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:53.720
we're now showing them be a bully,
um,

1196
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:59.390
lie,
cheat and steal.
And you could be the biggest Mo,
uh,

1197
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.090
highest paid baseball player of all time,
lie,
cheat and steal.

1198
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:05.120
And you could be the commissioner of Major League Baseball,
lie,

1199
01:11:05.121 --> 01:11:08.840
cheat and steal and you two kids can be president of the United States.

1200
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:13.870
And I think this toxic toxicity of the new American values is going to

1201
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:19.130
<v 2>do damage for generations and we're not going to be able to fully comprehend or</v>

1202
01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:24.450
understand or analyze the damage it's done for some,
for some time.

1203
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.480
And it was like after Clinton Clinton redefined what sex meant and we were

1204
01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:32.910
adults.
You could laugh at it,
but the truth is,

1205
01:11:32.911 --> 01:11:37.050
is that he said oral sex wasn't sex.
Right.
Okay.
Um,

1206
01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:42.710
and we saw the spike in sexually transmitted diseases among teenagers and young

1207
01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:47.760
people,
mostly through oral sex because they said,
oh,

1208
01:11:47.761 --> 01:11:51.630
well the president said really?
That absolutely.
Yeah,
that talk about a health.

1209
01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:55.400
Yeah,
it was a,
it was a,
it was a legitimate public health crisis use.

1210
01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:57.990
You saw following the Clinton Lewinsky scandal,

1211
01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:03.140
you saw an increase in sexually transmitted diseases through oral sex amongst

1212
01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:07.340
younger people because the president,
it's hard for us to,

1213
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:10.020
because we see the president right now is sort of a,
a comic,
you know,

1214
01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:13.530
as he sorta,
it's,
it's,
you know,
he's a reality show president.

1215
01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:16.080
We know it's bullshit.
But what do you tell kids?

1216
01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:17.670
This is the president of the United States.

1217
01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:22.440
Is that what it was or was it because there was so much discussion about him

1218
01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:25.020
getting his dick sucked that more people wanted to suck dicks and get their

1219
01:12:25.021 --> 01:12:28.230
decks sucked?
I think without question,
obviously the uh,

1220
01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:33.060
the size and scale of the coverage,
unquestionably people warming,

1221
01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.330
well legitimately,
but people,
people for a while,
people thought,

1222
01:12:39.331 --> 01:12:42.480
when I say people,
I'm talking to younger people.
Um,
developing mines,

1223
01:12:42.481 --> 01:12:45.900
impressionable youths were under the impression that you could not get a

1224
01:12:45.901 --> 01:12:50.901
sexually transmitted disease through something that wasn't sex and that and the

1225
01:12:50.911 --> 01:12:53.720
president reset those values.
Just like this president,

1226
01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:58.020
I feel is re calibrating our values.

1227
01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:01.050
And I think that that's,
that's what's most,

1228
01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:03.570
I mean other than the potential of nuclear war,
I think,

1229
01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:07.500
I think that is what is most dangerous and what could,

1230
01:13:07.530 --> 01:13:11.280
could cause the most long term damage from this is these new American values
lie,

1231
01:13:11.281 --> 01:13:13.970
cheat and steal.
I was literally at a Q and a with one of the kids that,

1232
01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:17.170
the little kid,
Ryan Blanco who plays Tony Bosch in the movie,

1233
01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:21.060
the lab coat and the,
the hair.
He's amazing.

1234
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:25.080
He's hilarious.
And so they're all great.
And he said,

1235
01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:27.360
I was at a Q and a and I was like,
you know,

1236
01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:31.020
what lessons do we learn from this movie?
And He,
this is where I got this from.

1237
01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.800
He interrupted,
he's 10 years old.
And he's like,
well,
I know,
I know.
I'm like,

1238
01:13:34.801 --> 01:13:36.880
Brian,
you have to raise your hand.
It's your Q and a to dude.
You're,

1239
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:39.480
you're on the panel.
And he's like,
lie,

1240
01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:42.300
cheat and steal and to win or something like that.
And I was like,

1241
01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:45.960
Oh fuck this kid's 10 years old,
you know.
And I'm like,

1242
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:50.670
this is what he thinks.
The values of America.
Well,

1243
01:13:50.671 --> 01:13:55.350
it's interesting because in the documentary,
one of the big things,

1244
01:13:55.710 --> 01:14:00.710
the news clippings is George Bush discussing steroids in baseball in 2004 was it

1245
01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:02.400
2000 state of the Union.

1246
01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:08.180
And he was talking about how it sends the wrong message that cheating in

1247
01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:11.980
baseball sends the wrong message to the youth of

1248
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.990
<v 1>America.
And there's,
I thought that was silly at the time.
I was like,
Eh,</v>

1249
01:14:15.991 --> 01:14:20.980
we'll fucking message.
But the reality is those things do have a ripple effect.

1250
01:14:20.981 --> 01:14:25.981
And if you tell people that the way to become this superstar athlete is not just

1251
01:14:26.621 --> 01:14:28.270
through hard work and dedication,

1252
01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:32.170
but also through taking things that are illegal because they're going to pump

1253
01:14:32.171 --> 01:14:35.860
you up and give you an edge on your competitors.
We're a shortcut society.

1254
01:14:35.861 --> 01:14:39.840
So we look for those,
those tricks of the trade,
you know,
always.
And we,

1255
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:44.860
and we don't believe necessarily when people do achieve something naturally or

1256
01:14:44.861 --> 01:14:47.740
via hard work,
we go,
what did,
what did he do?
What did she do?

1257
01:14:47.741 --> 01:14:52.741
What she really do problem is some of those shortcuts work like Adderall,

1258
01:14:52.930 --> 01:14:55.990
like steroids.
They fucking work,
man.
You know,

1259
01:14:55.991 --> 01:15:00.490
the UFC has had a giant problem with them for a long time and it was exacerbated

1260
01:15:00.491 --> 01:15:05.491
by this time period in the early two thousands where they allowed people,

1261
01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:07.690
I guess it wasn't quite the early two thousands.

1262
01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:12.330
It was actually later in the two thousands where they allowed people to take,
uh,

1263
01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:17.320
exogenous testosterone under therapeutic use exemptions.
They would call it TRT.

1264
01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:22.200
And so this famous like the Vitor Belfort era when he was on TRT just start

1265
01:15:22.201 --> 01:15:24.820
smashing people cause he looked so ridiculous,

1266
01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:29.740
he was so jacked and that during that time period they,

1267
01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:33.870
they fell into this,
there was a sort of uh,

1268
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:39.970
uh,
really a piss poor way of justifying it.

1269
01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:43.210
That justification was these people have low testosterone,

1270
01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:46.270
low testosterone is a disease.
If we give them testosterone,

1271
01:15:46.271 --> 01:15:47.140
they can perform better.

1272
01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:50.260
But the way around that was these guys were actually on steroids.

1273
01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.580
The steroids crashed.

1274
01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:55.480
Their testosterone had go and get a test look my testosterone's low.
Like Yup,

1275
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:58.770
you need testosterone.
And then they would take steroids,
you know,

1276
01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:03.640
essentially not steroids but testosterone which has similar effects.
And,
um,

1277
01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.120
and then eventually the UFC said,
look,
we fucked up.

1278
01:16:07.121 --> 01:16:08.350
We're going to go a hundred degrees,

1279
01:16:08.351 --> 01:16:11.920
the other hundred and 80 degrees the other way and Higher Usada and we're gonna,

1280
01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.620
we're gonna crawl up everyone's ass with a microscope.

1281
01:16:14.621 --> 01:16:18.880
We're going to find out what the fuck is up.
And men bodies changed.

1282
01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:20.410
Careers crumbled.

1283
01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:24.160
Bamyan we saw so many people get busted in the beginning.

1284
01:16:24.161 --> 01:16:27.520
So many people got caught and still are getting a Tj Dillashaw just got caught.

1285
01:16:27.521 --> 01:16:31.390
Who's a bantamweight champion?
Just,
just relinquished his belt for some,

1286
01:16:31.391 --> 01:16:33.800
I don't know what he got caught for.
I don't know what the circumstances were.

1287
01:16:33.801 --> 01:16:38.801
And some people have been caught for accidental contamination because they're

1288
01:16:38.891 --> 01:16:41.020
like,
there's a lot of different supplements that you could buy.

1289
01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:45.190
Even creating standard stuff that's totally legal to take,
but they,

1290
01:16:45.191 --> 01:16:47.830
they're contaminated because you're buying them from cheap sources.

1291
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:49.660
They make them in China and what have you.

1292
01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:52.480
That was the problem with this biogenesis thing is first of all,
Tony Bosch,

1293
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.660
who wore a lab coat,
had a stat.
The scopes,
hilarious,

1294
01:16:55.690 --> 01:17:00.540
called himself doctor t hat said Doctor Tony Bosch and believes,

1295
01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:04.690
which I think I am to have to check my email.

1296
01:17:04.810 --> 01:17:08.350
He went to the same medical school is Dr Pepper and Dr Dre.
Well,

1297
01:17:08.351 --> 01:17:11.450
I'm a ordained minister just so just so you know,

1298
01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:16.880
I've actually married people that's legally illegally ordained minister.

1299
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:18.600
I got it online.
Tony Bosch,

1300
01:17:18.601 --> 01:17:21.050
despite having attended one of our interview subjects,

1301
01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:25.190
refers to as the belief school of the medical and performing arts to get a

1302
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:26.520
doctorate.
Um,

1303
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:30.350
he was never a licensed physician in the United States and he was yet,

1304
01:17:30.351 --> 01:17:31.550
he had legitimate

1305
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:37.250
prescription pads and DEA numbers from doctors that he could then prescribe

1306
01:17:37.251 --> 01:17:37.700
these drugs.

1307
01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:40.760
And in fact wanted to go one step further like we were talking about with the

1308
01:17:40.761 --> 01:17:44.870
pill mills and actually sell them in house to his clients and was buying them in

1309
01:17:44.871 --> 01:17:47.420
the black market from some dude in a suburb of Miami,

1310
01:17:47.421 --> 01:17:50.930
making the Shit in his garage.
So that's problematic.
Well,
you know,

1311
01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:55.460
here's one that's problematic.
That's kind of weird.
Doctors of Chiropractic,
like,

1312
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:58.250
you know,
they don't go to medical school and they,

1313
01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.830
some of them will check this check if this is true.

1314
01:18:00.831 --> 01:18:05.450
Can chiropractors write prescriptions?
I don't think that they can.

1315
01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.840
I think some of them really,
I think in some places they can write prescriptions.

1316
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.800
Is that like in Tennessee or in like,
so

1317
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:15.290
where is that thing says?
No,
says they can't.

1318
01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.200
Like if some of them could be doctors though,

1319
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:24.810
highly dynamic adjustment year,
right.
You're feeling it.
No,
don't ever,

1320
01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:29.840
how about that?
Um,
I went to a chiropractor then them.
Yeah.

1321
01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:33.590
I thought they were real until I started reading about how it actually got.

1322
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:36.140
A lot of people aren't there that are chiropractors say I do a lot of good for

1323
01:18:36.141 --> 01:18:37.280
people.
I'm sure you do.

1324
01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:41.180
There's a lot of good therapies that chiropractors also offer,
so to churches,

1325
01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:45.770
but the,
the actual evidence that manipulating people,
especially your neck,

1326
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:49.970
that it does any good at all.
There's none and it actually has killed people.

1327
01:18:49.971 --> 01:18:52.670
People have died from having the neck manipulated.
Well,
I,

1328
01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:56.870
I felt a lot lighter after the chiropractor by about $400 when I,

1329
01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.030
it's true,
I mean they do a lot of shit,

1330
01:18:59.031 --> 01:19:02.600
cold laser and massage and stuff that does work.
But if you look at the,
you know,

1331
01:19:02.601 --> 01:19:06.290
it was invented by a guy who was a magnetic healer who was murdered by his own

1332
01:19:06.291 --> 01:19:09.560
son,
his own son,
murdered them,
ran over him with a car,

1333
01:19:09.561 --> 01:19:12.770
and then took over the business.
It sounds like a Sondheim musical.
It does crazy.

1334
01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:18.050
And it was all in like the 18 hundreds and we've had it for so long that people,

1335
01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.750
most people didn't look into it and say,
well,
what is this?

1336
01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.990
What is the science of this?
This guy thought that he could cure everything,

1337
01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:28.160
including blindness,
lukemia cancer from adjusting your back.

1338
01:19:28.161 --> 01:19:30.140
This was his premise was based on how's it going?

1339
01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:33.550
He came from a seance and now there's no more blindness or leukemia or toss

1340
01:19:33.551 --> 01:19:34.610
around.
It's amazing.

1341
01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:39.200
But there are still chiropractors that buy into that same idea that they can

1342
01:19:39.201 --> 01:19:40.280
cure things,

1343
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:43.160
that it's not just you're dealing with pain and if they manipulate you,

1344
01:19:43.161 --> 01:19:43.851
they can relieve pain.

1345
01:19:43.851 --> 01:19:48.851
Know that they can cure you of certain ailments because of your spine being on

1346
01:19:50.881 --> 01:19:53.810
the aligned incorrectly.
They're going to adjust it.

1347
01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.580
It's popping you just like this.

1348
01:19:56.150 --> 01:19:59.300
Just like you do that with your fingers when you crack your knuckles.
That's a,

1349
01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.060
it's the same thing.
It's like a release of nitrogen or something.

1350
01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:06.230
I'm not exactly sure what causes the crime,
but like legitimate.
Yeah,

1351
01:20:06.231 --> 01:20:08.370
but I don't see,
did you see anything?

1352
01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:12.060
<v 2>No.
Okay.
Maybe I'm wrong with them being below write prescriptions.</v>

1353
01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.820
I will tell you that Tony Bosch could not write prescriptions,
but he was doing,

1354
01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:18.150
he was doing it in any way or your,
regardless as we sat in my aunt doing it.

1355
01:20:18.151 --> 01:20:21.790
Right,
you're on our list when we say we say regardless of Miami because we're,

1356
01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.870
we're,
you're illiterate.
But,
but I,
I use it here ironically though.

1357
01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.681
So I just say no,

1358
01:20:25.681 --> 01:20:30.681
but I think he might have swiped a pad from his doctor who from his father who

1359
01:20:31.021 --> 01:20:35.390
was in legitimate a legitimate topic.
So he was forging his dads.
He had,
he had,

1360
01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:38.510
you know,
but they called medical directors.
That's part of these,

1361
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:43.380
the whole anti aging scheme really prospered in the state of Florida as you can

1362
01:20:43.381 --> 01:20:45.660
imagine.
And in no small part,

1363
01:20:45.661 --> 01:20:49.260
because there's a lot of doctors who from all over the country retire to
Florida,

1364
01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:54.180
but they are still medical doctors.
So you have guys like Tony Bosch,

1365
01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:55.940
entrepreneurial,
uh,

1366
01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:58.830
with an entrepreneurial spirit who want to open up these anti-aging clinics.

1367
01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.630
And they knew what's called a medical director.

1368
01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:04.620
So they go to a legitimate doctor and they say,
hey,
kind of rent us.

1369
01:21:04.621 --> 01:21:07.560
We'll put your name on the business,
you'll get a cut of the action.

1370
01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:12.740
And they're basically renting out their prescription pad and DEA number so that

1371
01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:13.740
guys,
you know,

1372
01:21:13.741 --> 01:21:17.610
these other operators who in this case identified themself falsely as doctors

1373
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:22.680
can,
you know,
exploit that,
uh,
that power of the prescription pad.

1374
01:21:22.681 --> 01:21:26.010
And so that's what was happening here.
And more problematic.

1375
01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:29.740
He started treating high school kids.
Oh No.

1376
01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:34.710
And whose parents and baseball coaches had heard about him through word of mouth

1377
01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:38.820
and brought these kids to him to get an advantage.
Um,
you know,

1378
01:21:38.821 --> 01:21:42.150
we have a big immigrant community obviously in Miami.
We have a lot,

1379
01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.370
it's a huge baseball community.

1380
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:49.350
People who are smuggled specifically into the country for the purpose of playing

1381
01:21:49.351 --> 01:21:53.400
baseball,
uh,
and signing those big guaranteed contracts right out of high school.

1382
01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.490
And so you have parents and kids and coaches looking for every advantage that

1383
01:21:56.491 --> 01:21:58.680
we're going to.
This guy,
um,
you know,

1384
01:21:58.681 --> 01:22:00.480
they weren't hearing about him in the high school locker room.

1385
01:22:00.481 --> 01:22:03.480
These were coaches and parents who are bringing their parents to,

1386
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:06.060
you might say a guy who they presumed was a real doctor,

1387
01:22:06.061 --> 01:22:08.790
but nonetheless looking to cheat,
you know,
to gain the system.

1388
01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:12.180
And that's problematic when you have this guy who knows,

1389
01:22:12.181 --> 01:22:15.570
he knows he's not a doctor,
but he was a true believer in himself.

1390
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.090
He really thought he was helping people.
And listen,
the proof's in the pudding.

1391
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:21.030
This guy could not exploit traditional advertising.

1392
01:22:21.031 --> 01:22:25.590
He wasn't doing billboards and TV ads.
He just,
he was strictly word of mouth.

1393
01:22:25.591 --> 01:22:27.630
So he had clients who were getting results,

1394
01:22:27.631 --> 01:22:31.920
including nearly a hundred cops who are referring their friends to his clinics.

1395
01:22:31.950 --> 01:22:35.930
So these parents came to him looking for help,
help for their kids.
Um,

1396
01:22:36.150 --> 01:22:40.110
and those kids are our victims.
Yeah.
Well that's for sure.

1397
01:22:40.111 --> 01:22:42.060
There's the last thing you want to do to a kid,

1398
01:22:42.061 --> 01:22:45.960
especially one that doesn't have any sort of real hormonal ailment,

1399
01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:49.020
is to inject exogenous hormones into their body.

1400
01:22:49.021 --> 01:22:51.930
It just fucks their brain up for emotions there.

1401
01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:56.550
The other entire endocrine system crashes afterwards.
It causes depression,

1402
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.760
leads to suicide and a lot of kids and depending what you're doing to them,

1403
01:22:59.761 --> 01:23:03.450
you could also be risking their offspring,
potential future offspring.

1404
01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:07.390
You could be killing their sperm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You definitely can.
Yeah.

1405
01:23:07.391 --> 01:23:08.650
The disproportionate amount of,

1406
01:23:08.710 --> 01:23:13.150
I mean in the steroid use population of um,

1407
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:16.090
autism,
childhood cancer,
just horrible,

1408
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.510
horrible things that happened to the children of people who are,

1409
01:23:19.511 --> 01:23:20.680
who are on some of these drugs.

1410
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:24.130
I think a lot of the folks that are looking at it in terms of a career in

1411
01:23:24.131 --> 01:23:27.370
baseball or in any other sport where they get benefit,
they go,
hey,

1412
01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:32.610
this is the price that I have to pay in order to excel at this extraordinary

1413
01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:37.150
avenue for financial gain.

1414
01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:42.420
Will Tony Bosch was treating Manny Ramirez and when he was in Boston and um,

1415
01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:45.460
low testosterone,
you know,

1416
01:23:45.461 --> 01:23:49.480
he was getting on in the years and Bosch started treating him,

1417
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:54.410
put them on a protocol as he called it.
Um,
take the,
you know,

1418
01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:58.030
x amount of why substance,
et Cetera at this time each day.

1419
01:23:58.150 --> 01:24:00.210
Microdosing as you said.
So,
um,

1420
01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:04.000
it wouldn't any event that they were randomly tested,
they wouldn't be detected.

1421
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:08.050
I Dunno if that worked or not or he was giving him placebos on certain days.

1422
01:24:08.051 --> 01:24:09.700
I don't know what the,
the scheme was,

1423
01:24:09.730 --> 01:24:13.180
but Manny starts to come back again.

1424
01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:16.840
I don't know if it was psychosomatic or he really was actually performing better

1425
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:18.220
and that's when he got his Dodgers deal.

1426
01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:23.221
What was it like a $40 million deal in theoretically thanks in no small part to

1427
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:28.420
this guy who is,
you know,
who was juicing.
Uh,
and that's,

1428
01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.310
and then Manny gets busted,

1429
01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:35.340
pisses dirty after a surprise test before a game because according to Bosh,

1430
01:24:36.190 --> 01:24:40.570
he didn't take the micro dose on precisely the instructions,
you know,

1431
01:24:40.571 --> 01:24:44.920
that he had given them.
And so pissed dirty and as a result of the,

1432
01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:48.850
what you would assume was negative publicity from Manny getting busted and then

1433
01:24:48.851 --> 01:24:51.760
connecting it to Tony Bosch in Miami.

1434
01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:57.360
That was the word of mouth that got a rods cousin to come to bosh and say,

1435
01:24:57.551 --> 01:25:02.310
Hey,
you should meet my cousin.
He's playing this game and tamp,
I'll come up and,

1436
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:04.750
and meet him.
And it turns out that it's Alex Rodriguez.

1437
01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:09.400
It's just amazing that someone who made as much money as Alex Rodriguez has

1438
01:25:09.490 --> 01:25:13.930
knuckleheads like that,
who can't see the future because of,
if I was his friend,

1439
01:25:13.931 --> 01:25:17.620
I'd be like,
hold on,
hold on,
hold on.
He's already been busted,
dude.
Listen to me.

1440
01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.540
They're looking at him.
They're watching.
I know.
Nine.
Yeah.
I mean,

1441
01:25:20.650 --> 01:25:23.290
while they weren't even,
weren't even,
they don't get,
listen,

1442
01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:26.800
baseball is like everything else in American life now,
including politics.

1443
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:30.550
It's the WWE.
Okay.
When Bud Seelig,

1444
01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:33.550
the steroid commissioner was on his way out the door,

1445
01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:35.710
literally on the eve of retirement.
And he's like,
you know what,

1446
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.520
I need to look like I'm doing something about this because I've got a great big

1447
01:25:39.521 --> 01:25:42.790
fat astrick by my name in,
you know,
in the record books here,

1448
01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:44.500
like all these players do with the steroid era.

1449
01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.920
I need to look like I did something on my way out the door.

1450
01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:51.700
So he calls his second in command,
Rob Manfred and says,
let's do,

1451
01:25:51.850 --> 01:25:53.260
let's do something about this.

1452
01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:57.490
And they go after the biggest scalp you can in the game,
Alex Rodriguez.

1453
01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:02.840
And so when they needed Alex is the heel.
That was the storyline.
Yeah.

1454
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:07.040
Okay.
So they nail Alex.
All right.
Um,
you know,

1455
01:26:07.130 --> 01:26:11.090
the Vince Mcmahon of the game,
Bud Sealey goes,
I took care of them.
Retires,

1456
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:14.190
rob Manfred,
who was in charge of this whole botched,
you know,

1457
01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:19.300
quasi legal operation investigation biogenesis and an Alex gets the top Gig.

1458
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:26.580
And is now the commissioner of baseball.
And he goes,
you know,

1459
01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:27.710
it would be a good storyline.

1460
01:26:27.711 --> 01:26:32.630
Now what if I bring a rod and Pete rose back,

1461
01:26:32.631 --> 01:26:36.140
his commentators,
oh,
Janie did for like a rod and Pete Rose,

1462
01:26:36.141 --> 01:26:38.000
we're working together by the way.
They were damn good.

1463
01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.660
They may are damn good television dude.
And as commentators,

1464
01:26:41.890 --> 01:26:44.150
until Pete rose got in trouble again,
they asked him.

1465
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:49.330
But now you've got rob Manfred who basically put it all on the line and a rod

1466
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:55.160
who put it all on the line fighting each other in this battle of the legacies

1467
01:26:55.161 --> 01:26:55.994
with bud Seelig.

1468
01:26:56.750 --> 01:27:01.750
Now they're posing with J lo out at nightclubs and stuff because that's the new

1469
01:27:02.421 --> 01:27:04.880
storyline.
The story like,
you know,
one day you're the heel,

1470
01:27:04.881 --> 01:27:08.830
the next day you're the hero.
He'll here.
It's like whatever,
whatever.
And,
and,

1471
01:27:08.831 --> 01:27:10.670
and they're just selling everybody this,

1472
01:27:10.671 --> 01:27:12.730
this bill of goods that this is all real.
You know,

1473
01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:17.760
you really have a picture that was him with the Minotaur's body center center.

1474
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:21.830
So real,
so this is,
I don't know if this is apocryphal or real.

1475
01:27:21.831 --> 01:27:25.520
I know people who have been in the apartment and claim to have seen it.

1476
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:27.800
The problem is is I don't,

1477
01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:30.740
I don't know if they're telling the truth or they're like kind of like fueling

1478
01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:33.260
the apocryphal tale.
So

1479
01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:38.180
I want to believe,
I want to believe no one to pull.
That's the problem.

1480
01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.980
We all want to believe so.
I mean,
spoiler alert,
we fucking,
we did it.

1481
01:27:43.010 --> 01:27:47.330
We put it in there with the little kid's space.
Amazing.
Just select.
Yes you did.

1482
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:52.340
It's hilarious.
The kid who plays a rod is a fucking amazing.
It's the light eyes.

1483
01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:56.750
He's amazing is like when these doing,
I don't want to give too much of a way,

1484
01:27:56.751 --> 01:28:00.080
but making the funny faces and court,
it's like fucking hilarious.

1485
01:28:00.081 --> 01:28:05.060
I mean it's so good.
I was just laughing.
I was like,
this is so ridiculous.

1486
01:28:05.061 --> 01:28:07.850
And to know that this is all something that really happened.
I had to tell you,

1487
01:28:07.851 --> 01:28:11.360
we've been,
we've been at this making documentaries for like 20 years now almost.

1488
01:28:11.361 --> 01:28:16.361
And so this is the most as ridiculous and fucking absurd is this is it is the

1489
01:28:18.801 --> 01:28:22.940
most meticulously researched documentary we have ever done.

1490
01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:28.450
Why we're dealing with some very powerful litigious yes individuals and

1491
01:28:28.571 --> 01:28:32.630
organizations.
So we knew we had to get this a hundred percent right.

1492
01:28:32.631 --> 01:28:37.070
Not to mention the way we shot this on set,
on location for 10 days.

1493
01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:40.570
We had the playback on the set so we were committed to this dialogue.
Right.

1494
01:28:40.770 --> 01:28:45.260
And so we had to make sure we went and obtained transcripts that were never

1495
01:28:45.261 --> 01:28:50.261
released publicly of a sworn testimony in the case to be able to cross check

1496
01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:53.540
some of the stuff that we were told and we're going to put in the documentary

1497
01:28:53.541 --> 01:28:54.680
and we just,

1498
01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:59.740
I mean we actually shot at some of the actual locations in Miami where these

1499
01:28:59.811 --> 01:29:02.940
real events took place.
The Fountain Will Live at the Fountain Blue Hotel,

1500
01:29:02.941 --> 01:29:05.190
you know the nightclub,
the sports grill in south Miami,

1501
01:29:05.191 --> 01:29:07.680
the Ritz Carlton Keep Skiing.
We actually took the kids there,

1502
01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.090
put the facial hair on,

1503
01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:13.860
put the fucking cop uniforms on and the pin stripes on and we just filmed them

1504
01:29:13.861 --> 01:29:18.030
all over town.
What's funny about about it in Miami,
no one looked twice at us.

1505
01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:21.180
No one thought anything of just us running around these little kids with beards

1506
01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:25.650
and mustaches and gray hair and the flat coke scene where they're looking for

1507
01:29:25.651 --> 01:29:29.160
the blood in the nightclub.
We lost the vial.
I'm like,

1508
01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:34.400
what in the fuck and fact that he drew his blood in the bathroom and then lost

1509
01:29:35.161 --> 01:29:39.060
the vial like Jesus Christ.
It was so crazy.

1510
01:29:39.061 --> 01:29:42.990
I was just watching it like shaking my head like this is all real.

1511
01:29:42.991 --> 01:29:44.130
This is how this went down.

1512
01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:46.710
That guy was worth how many hundreds of millions of dollars,

1513
01:29:46.711 --> 01:29:51.000
how much owe 400 over 400 million was his gross revenue just in baseball and he

1514
01:29:51.001 --> 01:29:52.790
just had knuckleheads.

1515
01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:56.730
I mean the fact that he was like willing to keep this guy around him.

1516
01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:59.910
He grew up in Miami.
That's who you surround yourself with when you,

1517
01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:02.550
when you grow up in Miami.
And that scene was,
I mean,

1518
01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:06.150
that scene we had like all those kids,
like all the extra kids partying,

1519
01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:08.820
shout out to my director of photography,
BG gold.

1520
01:30:08.821 --> 01:30:11.970
Nicky did a hell of a job like that was somehow getting complicated.
Shoot.

1521
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:15.570
It's a great documentary,
but all your shit's great.
Thanks.

1522
01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:19.080
I'm a big fan of all your stuff,
but this one's particularly silly.

1523
01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:21.690
You should come down to Miami.
You should see we're doing,

1524
01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:25.380
I'm almost embarrassed to say it.
I just mentioned to you earlier,

1525
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:30.030
we turned cocaine cowboys into a stage play.
Yeah.

1526
01:30:30.031 --> 01:30:32.930
You were saying that before we started and I'm like,
why should I,

1527
01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:37.350
you should come back.
How can you,
should come,
it's not a musical.
Okay.

1528
01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:40.830
She come down and see,
it's called confessions of a cocaine cowboy.

1529
01:30:40.831 --> 01:30:44.130
You might remember in the documentary,
um,
there was a Hitman,

1530
01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:48.420
Jorge Riviera Allah who he worked for La that ina the godmother Griselda Blanco.

1531
01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:53.340
And,
um,
when we first started researching the doc in 2004,

1532
01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:58.880
we obtained a seven volume 1300 page deposition that he gave.

1533
01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:05.850
And normally in a depo,
you're like the answers like yes,
no,
yes,

1534
01:31:05.851 --> 01:31:09.300
no,
I don't remember.
Don't recall.
This was like,

1535
01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:14.160
he was a cooperating witness against Griselda in,
in,
in Miami Dade County,

1536
01:31:14.161 --> 01:31:18.420
state of Florida was a three capital murder charges.
So three death penalties.

1537
01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:21.990
We're talking old sparky cases and the electric chair.

1538
01:31:22.050 --> 01:31:26.490
And so he was cooperating witness.
So it read like a monologue.
It read,

1539
01:31:26.491 --> 01:31:29.070
like I'm reading it and going on with the new World School of the arts high

1540
01:31:29.071 --> 01:31:30.960
school,
which is where I studied theater.

1541
01:31:30.961 --> 01:31:33.540
So I was reading a lot of plays and I was like,
Oh shit,
this is,

1542
01:31:33.630 --> 01:31:35.520
this would be like a great play.

1543
01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.720
And 15 years later we turned it into confession of a cocaine,

1544
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:44.220
confessions of a cocaine cowboy.
And you said it's kind of funny.
So

1545
01:31:46.090 --> 01:31:50.100
someone described it or if he's right there.
Oh Shit.
Yeah,
my producing partner.

1546
01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:53.820
Umm,
that's Yancey areas from a formerly spoiler alert.

1547
01:31:53.821 --> 01:31:56.430
He's not on the show anymore.
It's character.
Got into some trouble.

1548
01:31:56.670 --> 01:32:01.180
A queen of the south on USA.
Um,
he's,
he's brilliant in the show.
Uh,

1549
01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:06.130
and so,
uh,
my producing partner,
David Zipkin describes it who,
uh,

1550
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:09.010
coproduce cocaine cowboys and edited,
edited it with me.

1551
01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:12.160
He's described it as a cross between cocaine cowboys and my Twitter feed.

1552
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:16.330
That's how he,
that's how he described it.
So like it's a little reverent.

1553
01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:20.040
It's obviously a little absurd if you're gonna put kind of cocaine cowboys is a

1554
01:32:20.041 --> 01:32:24.450
live theater event.
So we kind of acknowledged the absurdity of it.
Um,

1555
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:28.300
and the Biz,
the surreal exploitation of it.

1556
01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:31.810
And you know,
the Guy Michel Housemen,

1557
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:35.860
who's the director of the play at Miami new trauma at the colony theater and

1558
01:32:35.861 --> 01:32:38.890
Miami beach on Lincoln road.
He said,
um,
he said,

1559
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:42.460
why are we doing cocaine cowboys for the theater in 2019?

1560
01:32:43.150 --> 01:32:44.050
And I was like,

1561
01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:47.890
it's a good question cause like it speaks to the relevance of like,

1562
01:32:47.891 --> 01:32:52.540
why do this now?
And I said,
well,
if you take away from the documentary,

1563
01:32:52.541 --> 01:32:54.070
you take away the drugs and the money.

1564
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:58.480
It's really a story about immigrants,

1565
01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:02.560
children and gun violence.
That's what it's about.

1566
01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:06.700
And what could be more relevant in the contemporary conversation then

1567
01:33:06.730 --> 01:33:10.210
immigration children and gun violence.
And so ultimately,

1568
01:33:10.211 --> 01:33:14.830
I wanted to make a story about the Miami of yesterday,
but the America of today,

1569
01:33:14.831 --> 01:33:17.170
like I said,
the Miami of today is the America of tomorrow.

1570
01:33:17.171 --> 01:33:19.960
So here's a story about Miami in the 1980s,

1571
01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:23.920
but it really resembles the America of today.

1572
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:28.090
And so to do that we had to not make it totally fucking depressing and

1573
01:33:28.091 --> 01:33:32.510
disturbing.
We injected a lot of humor and a lot of irreverence and intuit,
um,

1574
01:33:32.650 --> 01:33:37.330
the woman Zilla Mendoza who plays Griselda Blanco also plays the state attorney.

1575
01:33:37.810 --> 01:33:42.190
So she has this dual role as sort of these dueling antagonists against Rivy the

1576
01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:46.840
hitman.
And it's just,
uh,
you know,
I was writing it with a friend or in squire,

1577
01:33:46.841 --> 01:33:51.841
this great TV writer and does play on play both roles because I felt that they

1578
01:33:52.091 --> 01:33:55.300
were flip sides of the same coin.

1579
01:33:56.290 --> 01:34:00.670
I think the state attorney is an interesting character.
Different clothes.

1580
01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.050
Oh yeah.
She changed and it has,

1581
01:34:02.051 --> 01:34:05.770
it has different hair and in fact the performances are so different and the

1582
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.720
voices are so different than Zillow does.

1583
01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:11.140
Some people after the show would be like,
oh my God,
she was amazing.

1584
01:34:11.290 --> 01:34:12.590
Zillow was amazing as a,

1585
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:18.270
as a Griselda Blanco who's the actress that plays the state attorney Kathy and

1586
01:34:18.461 --> 01:34:21.410
we're like,
oh,
we won't tell them.
Like that's some weird though,
don't.

1587
01:34:21.411 --> 01:34:25.900
Last time I heard of that being done effectively was Mars attacks.

1588
01:34:26.010 --> 01:34:30.310
The Jack Nicholson played everybody cowboy president of the program.

1589
01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.050
I liked Barnes attacks.
These real underrated Tim Burton.

1590
01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:38.880
Hugely underrated.
Amazing scores that cool.
I Dunno.

1591
01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:43.350
Like especially now I feel like it really holds up.
I still go ack ack

1592
01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:50.470
talking about Ufo related things.
It was for posterous.
It's just,

1593
01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:55.150
I love that movie.
I love it.
I love,
oh my God,
they're crazy.
It's great.

1594
01:34:55.151 --> 01:35:00.100
It's holds up man.
You know,
I it like two years ago.
It holds up.
It's,

1595
01:35:00.150 --> 01:35:03.290
it's,
it's,
it's wonderful.
It really is.

1596
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:05.900
That's interesting though that you chose to use the same woman.

1597
01:35:05.901 --> 01:35:07.640
Did you think about that for a while?

1598
01:35:07.641 --> 01:35:11.370
Did you have another woman you always wanted to do it from the beginning?
Always.

1599
01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:12.110
I just,

1600
01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:15.620
I have a strange relationship with the state attorney in Miami Dade County.

1601
01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:21.020
She's been the state attorney for about 26 years now.
And,
and you know,

1602
01:35:21.021 --> 01:35:23.530
when she was first elected,
she was like the first,
uh,

1603
01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:28.130
Cuban state attorney in the state of Florida.
Um,
very ambitious.
She was,

1604
01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:32.630
she's been the only state attorney we've had since Janet Reno left us for the

1605
01:35:32.631 --> 01:35:35.450
Clinton administration.
Whoa.
That's how long she's been state attorney.

1606
01:35:35.451 --> 01:35:40.250
So now she has one of those records where you examine it and you say,

1607
01:35:40.251 --> 01:35:44.150
okay,
what's actually happening in this town?
When people say to me like,

1608
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:48.040
why is Miami so fucking corrupt and why?
You know,
why,

1609
01:35:48.041 --> 01:35:51.200
why does corruption grow,
grow,

1610
01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:54.560
get a greater and wider than fucking oranges in,
in Miami?

1611
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:59.890
And the reason is when you have the top cop and town is not effectively in force

1612
01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:04.820
public corruption laws and does not pursue public corruption.

1613
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:09.440
You have an area where it's just,
you send a message of impunity.

1614
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:11.180
That's the bottom line.
You know,

1615
01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:16.010
no trouble arresting innocent young black kids on drug charges or whatever.

1616
01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:20.450
But like when it comes to enforcing public corruption,

1617
01:36:20.690 --> 01:36:25.530
she's just nonexistent.
And so what happens is,
is you,

1618
01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:29.120
you have a,
and of course it,
it's like the broken windows theory of crime.

1619
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:33.290
If you allow petty corruption to,
to,
to,
to go.

1620
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:38.830
Eventually some of these politicians wind up literally in a closet at city hall

1621
01:36:39.351 --> 01:36:40.790
accepting bags full of money.

1622
01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:44.780
And the only thing we've been able to rely on to some extent is the feds coming

1623
01:36:44.781 --> 01:36:45.920
in and trying to help.

1624
01:36:45.921 --> 01:36:50.921
But you have the state attorney who as never in her 26 years in office charged a

1625
01:36:53.001 --> 01:36:56.060
police officer for non-duty killing.
Whoa.

1626
01:36:56.420 --> 01:37:00.710
Despite a proliferation of these incidents.
So it's not like it's,
oh,

1627
01:37:00.711 --> 01:37:03.680
it's not happening as often the incidents have exploded in the reason the

1628
01:37:03.681 --> 01:37:06.740
incidents have exploded is because police know that they'll get away with it

1629
01:37:06.741 --> 01:37:09.350
because Kathy will not prosecute them.

1630
01:37:09.650 --> 01:37:12.510
So the message that's being sent is it dangerous,
wanted it,

1631
01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:16.890
and it is created a toxic effect with the relationship between obviously police

1632
01:37:16.891 --> 01:37:20.660
and,
and,
and the citizens that they're supposed to be protecting and serving.

1633
01:37:20.661 --> 01:37:25.040
And it's,
it's created a very dangerous situation,
uh,
in the city.
And,

1634
01:37:25.041 --> 01:37:30.041
and it's also created a situation where just like mayor after mayor just gets

1635
01:37:30.741 --> 01:37:35.020
away with pure fuckery,
you know?
Oh God.
Yeah.
And that's,
that's what,

1636
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:36.590
it's a not a sexy answer.
People,
it was like,

1637
01:37:36.591 --> 01:37:40.190
why is Miami so corrupted by people want some sort of sexy answer?
And I say,

1638
01:37:40.191 --> 01:37:44.300
well,
when the top cop is the same person for 26 years,
you know,

1639
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:45.343
if you're looking at,

1640
01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:48.830
if you want to know what's wrong in a community or with anything,

1641
01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.440
you don't look at what changes.
I mean,
mayors come and go,

1642
01:37:51.441 --> 01:37:54.650
police chiefs come and go,
commissioners come and go.
Um,

1643
01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:00.270
killers come and go.
You know,
criminals come and go.
You look at the constants.

1644
01:38:00.271 --> 01:38:04.740
You say,
what's been the same here for 26 years?
That's got to be the problem.

1645
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:07.290
And sure as shit.
That's,
that's the problem.

1646
01:38:07.291 --> 01:38:11.880
So I wanted to make a statement about the state of Miami today.
Um,

1647
01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:14.240
and say that,
that,
you know,
uh,

1648
01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:20.450
also Griselda Blanco was born in Colombia in a very difficult time in the

1649
01:38:21.901 --> 01:38:23.730
history of that country during labial Lencia.

1650
01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:28.880
This brutal civil is brutal civil war between liberal and conservative parties.

1651
01:38:29.130 --> 01:38:32.220
That went on for like 20 years,
almost caused,

1652
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:36.950
caused the horrific murders of like 200,000 people.
Um,

1653
01:38:37.170 --> 01:38:39.030
some very brutal,
some very public.

1654
01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:42.720
It's been reported that she as a hobby with their friends and their youth,

1655
01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:46.350
he's just run around and just bury bodies that were just lying in the street or

1656
01:38:46.351 --> 01:38:49.350
lying around.
Like that was just a hobby,
something for the kids to do.

1657
01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:52.350
And so you grow up in that environment were saying earlier,
like,

1658
01:38:52.351 --> 01:38:54.850
you're opening a cult.
You grow up in that environment.
You're,

1659
01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.340
it's like he's fucked.
You know,

1660
01:38:56.341 --> 01:39:00.810
you're not exactly born into money or power or wealth.
You know,

1661
01:39:00.811 --> 01:39:04.980
your dad's not a judge.
You don't exactly have those benefits or opportunities.

1662
01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.320
And if you can try to make something of yourself.

1663
01:39:07.321 --> 01:39:10.440
I mean the problem of course as a result of the Blanco went into a and elicit

1664
01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:11.970
and illicit trade,

1665
01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:16.440
but a trade that a lot of people in Columbia we're getting into from that era.

1666
01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:17.910
Um,
it's just,

1667
01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:22.350
I wanted to have a discussion about a lot of the characters argue with each

1668
01:39:22.351 --> 01:39:24.450
other and the play about how different everybody is.

1669
01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:29.660
It's like that and how Miami is like game of Thrones and paradise with slightly

1670
01:39:29.821 --> 01:39:31.290
fewer dragons.
You know,

1671
01:39:31.291 --> 01:39:35.340
like we just self segregate and it becomes this battle of fiefdoms and,

1672
01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:39.060
and um,
cause we're not like,
we're not multicultural.

1673
01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:41.130
We're very much segregated.

1674
01:39:41.131 --> 01:39:44.100
Like I always say the common misconception about Miami is that we're a melting

1675
01:39:44.101 --> 01:39:45.570
pot.
We are not a melting pot.

1676
01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:49.200
We are a TV dinner where sometimes the PS fall into the mashed potatoes.

1677
01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:54.510
We have our little kingdoms,
you know,
by,
by flag,
by nationality.

1678
01:39:54.511 --> 01:39:55.980
Very much so.
Um,

1679
01:39:56.010 --> 01:40:00.690
and so everybody's arguing about how we're different and the place sort of when

1680
01:40:00.691 --> 01:40:01.590
you walk away you're like,
okay,

1681
01:40:01.591 --> 01:40:05.310
but this is a conversation about how we're all the same and some of us have

1682
01:40:05.311 --> 01:40:07.830
different opportunities than,
than,
than others.

1683
01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:10.650
And it's just a matter of what we're able to make of those,

1684
01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:15.210
of those opportunities.
And that was sort of the comparison I was making by,

1685
01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:18.150
because it's a little locally,
it's a little scandalous.

1686
01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:22.770
The fact that the same actress plays both of these,
these very powerful,

1687
01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:25.200
because Cathy,

1688
01:40:25.201 --> 01:40:29.280
the state attorney is a very powerful popular figure.

1689
01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:31.920
So because you've publicly stated that there's a reason,

1690
01:40:31.921 --> 01:40:35.790
there's parallels between her and Chris on the problem and let's say the

1691
01:40:35.791 --> 01:40:39.660
portrayal is not the most flattering in the play I word.

1692
01:40:40.110 --> 01:40:42.540
I think she gets a fair shake in the play,
but,

1693
01:40:42.541 --> 01:40:45.750
but really the character through his commentary comes down pretty hard on her.

1694
01:40:45.930 --> 01:40:49.620
I've been publicly very critical of her.
Uh,

1695
01:40:49.621 --> 01:40:54.250
I think it had hope in a constructive way publicly in,
in via social media.

1696
01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:58.730
Um,
and,
but I mean 26 years in age,

1697
01:40:58.750 --> 01:41:02.230
almost 70 people that,
yeah,
that is fascinating.

1698
01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:07.260
You got to wonder if it's a spoken agreement or if this is just a unknown sort

1699
01:41:07.481 --> 01:41:11.290
of,
uh,
just this is just how she does business.
You don't have to worry,

1700
01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:16.390
I call it a conspiracy of convenience because not every conspiracy involves a

1701
01:41:16.391 --> 01:41:17.470
bunch of,
you know,

1702
01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:22.471
a rogues gallery at a board room table and a dark smokey room.

1703
01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:25.640
You know,
it's talking about,
okay,
how are we going to conspire?

1704
01:41:25.641 --> 01:41:28.210
I'm going to going to see conspiracies of convenience or just like,

1705
01:41:28.211 --> 01:41:33.190
people are in positions of power and everybody just kind of wink,
wink,
nod,
nod.

1706
01:41:33.191 --> 01:41:37.090
Everybody knows what they're supposed to do and you don't ruffle feathers and

1707
01:41:37.091 --> 01:41:41.560
you don't,
you don't fuck with conventional wisdom.
And uh,
this is the way,

1708
01:41:41.561 --> 01:41:43.990
it's all always,
this is the way it's always been done.

1709
01:41:43.991 --> 01:41:46.180
So this is the way we do it.
And everybody just kind of,

1710
01:41:46.181 --> 01:41:49.720
you either fall in line or they get rid of you one way or another.

1711
01:41:49.721 --> 01:41:53.450
And so that's just the way fiefdoms operate.
Oh,

1712
01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:59.460
this sounds like such an exhausting project to create a play out of that sort of

1713
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:05.980
horrific time in Miami's history.
It was fucking exhausting.

1714
01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:08.620
How could I,
I was like,
when you told me you were doing it,

1715
01:42:08.890 --> 01:42:12.100
that's the first thing I thought of.
Well,
being a lazy fuck.
I'm like,

1716
01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:13.860
that's so much time.
You know,

1717
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:17.260
it seems like so much time to do and I want to do that.
You know,
there's,
there's,

1718
01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:20.620
it's like documentary racket is not very profitable.

1719
01:42:20.650 --> 01:42:25.650
So I wanted to go with a real money is theater plays a playwright,

1720
01:42:26.850 --> 01:42:31.440
you're gonna make it fortune Billy.
And I said to him,
to my,

1721
01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:34.930
my coauthor or in Squire and the director,
I was like,
listen,
I was like,

1722
01:42:34.931 --> 01:42:39.310
this has to be purely theatrical experience to,
nope,
no projections,

1723
01:42:39.311 --> 01:42:43.270
no archive.
Like news footage,
like we using the document.
I'm like,
if in Miami,

1724
01:42:43.271 --> 01:42:47.470
first of all these days,
if I just got to put my pants on to leave the house,

1725
01:42:47.471 --> 01:42:50.950
that's a fucking hassle.
Meaning like if I could just,
when I'm home,

1726
01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:54.460
if I can just chill,
I want to just chill.
So if I'm going to be like,
okay,

1727
01:42:54.461 --> 01:42:56.870
I gotta go see a fucking play,
I'm like,

1728
01:42:56.890 --> 01:43:00.040
so first thing I had to do is put my pants on.
All right,
so I put my pants on.

1729
01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.510
Then you've got to get in the car.
He got a brave,

1730
01:43:01.511 --> 01:43:04.750
this traffic it's spring break on right now might be beach.
It's out of control.

1731
01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:06.370
So you've got to go to south beach,

1732
01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:11.460
go to the theater Lincoln Road and then like pay your hard earned money to see

1733
01:43:12.371 --> 01:43:16.030
this play because plays are more expensive tickets for plays or a lot pricier

1734
01:43:16.031 --> 01:43:19.960
than a movie.
Right?
And so,
or a Netflix subscription.
So you go and I'm like,

1735
01:43:19.961 --> 01:43:21.940
I don't want people to be there.
Like what the hell?

1736
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:24.400
I could have just stayed home and watched the shit on,
on Netflix.

1737
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:27.730
I want people to go like Holy Shit.
And we're actually seeing that.
We're seeing,

1738
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:29.343
um,

1739
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:33.940
a really disproportionate number of people coming to the theater who have never

1740
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:38.730
been to like a live play before because of their interest in the subject matter.

1741
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:41.770
The title,
confessions of a cocaine cowboy or the documentary.

1742
01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:45.340
So people are coming and they're rowdy and they're like interacting with the

1743
01:43:45.341 --> 01:43:45.791
actors.

1744
01:43:45.791 --> 01:43:48.640
It's kind of fun cause we do a lot of breaking of the fourth wall where Rivy

1745
01:43:48.641 --> 01:43:51.100
talks to the crowd or the cops talked to the crowd.

1746
01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:55.410
And so they're talking back the audience in there and it's fun and very and

1747
01:43:55.460 --> 01:44:00.200
funny and,
and uh,
I think pretty thought provoking,
particularly at the end.
And,

1748
01:44:00.230 --> 01:44:04.970
um,
they just like,
uh,
this audience is,
is we're like,

1749
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.490
oh shit,
you can't duplicate this experience in any way.

1750
01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:11.690
You know that and be like,
yeah,
I mean,
watching comedy on Netflix is one thing.

1751
01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:15.410
Being in the room,
it's a totally different energy to the terminology.

1752
01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:19.560
It's a rush.
It's like,
you know,
it's like a drug.
How many seats?
Uh,
this,

1753
01:44:19.561 --> 01:44:23.590
the or 420.
Oh,
it's great for 20,
bro.
Fairly intimate.
Oh,

1754
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:30.320
but that's a good size for an intimate live show.
It's huge.
And,
and um,

1755
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:32.870
it's a beautiful,
it's like a historic theater in Miami beach.

1756
01:44:32.871 --> 01:44:35.870
There's not a lot of,
what's it called?
Which the colony theater.
Okay.

1757
01:44:35.871 --> 01:44:37.640
I know where that on Lincoln road.
It's that walking street.

1758
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:40.010
You're probably getting back when we had the comedy festival,

1759
01:44:40.011 --> 01:44:43.700
you probably did it where you are at the Fillmore and you might've done the

1760
01:44:43.701 --> 01:44:48.240
colony Jackie Gleason show more now.
Yeah.
Um,
I,
I've done,

1761
01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.410
I've done a few different places.
I don't remember all of them.

1762
01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:54.500
This is a smaller room for you,
but like it's a great cool space.

1763
01:44:54.501 --> 01:44:56.560
It used to be an old movie theater and my grandma used to go see,

1764
01:44:57.380 --> 01:45:00.080
we don't preserve a lot of our history in Miami.
It's like I was saying earlier,

1765
01:45:00.081 --> 01:45:02.690
like we're such a young city,

1766
01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:07.720
literally young and we're like America's perpetual rebellious teenager where

1767
01:45:10.611 --> 01:45:14.360
like everything new we don't like,
we have a transient population,

1768
01:45:14.361 --> 01:45:17.300
a lack of institutional memory.
And we're like,
fuck history,

1769
01:45:17.301 --> 01:45:19.070
let's just knock this down and build new.

1770
01:45:19.071 --> 01:45:22.580
Cause that's the only way to create jobs.
Like knocking shit down,
redesigning it,

1771
01:45:22.581 --> 01:45:25.430
rebuilding it,
repopulating it,
building a tall,

1772
01:45:25.431 --> 01:45:28.940
or creating more revenue because we don't have a state income tax in Florida.

1773
01:45:28.941 --> 01:45:31.220
So it's just like,
it just constant hustle.

1774
01:45:31.221 --> 01:45:33.740
So to have a place like that where it's like,
oh,

1775
01:45:33.741 --> 01:45:36.650
we're going to take a deep breath and say this is a cool spot.

1776
01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:40.310
There's no venues like this in town.
It's been your for almost a hundred years.

1777
01:45:40.311 --> 01:45:43.850
Like let's preserve it,
you know,
let's preserve the original architecture.

1778
01:45:43.851 --> 01:45:45.790
Let's preserve some of the,
the,
the oldest,

1779
01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:47.840
like this old carving of like Pelicans,

1780
01:45:47.841 --> 01:45:50.240
like this really creepy like old school deco art.

1781
01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:51.890
They just preserved it and it's really,

1782
01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:56.360
it's like the perfect environment to do a show that's like by Miami.
For Miami.

1783
01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:00.080
Yeah.
The no income tax things very attractive to people.
People,

1784
01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:03.530
millions to states that don't have income.
That's one thing that pulls Nevada,

1785
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:07.720
pulls people into Nevada.
Why do you think Oj Simpson moved there?
He had like,

1786
01:46:07.730 --> 01:46:10.700
there was a law where they couldn't get his money.
Right.
We have the homestead,

1787
01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:15.020
uh,
law,
like the,
you know,
you can,
you can't get the money,

1788
01:46:15.021 --> 01:46:17.040
you can't get the house you can.
It's a,

1789
01:46:17.041 --> 01:46:20.840
it's a great place to sort of hide assets.
I told you like a third world country.

1790
01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:25.610
It's got banana republic.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause he,
he got,
he lost the civil case.

1791
01:46:25.930 --> 01:46:28.100
You're 30 plus million dollar judgment against him.

1792
01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:32.270
And so we bought a fucking house in Florida.
Now he,
is he still there?

1793
01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:36.680
Oh,
I don't think so.
I think he's in Vegas now.
I think he,
I think he,

1794
01:46:37.010 --> 01:46:41.300
they released him but they were gonna I think he might be on paper.

1795
01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:43.610
So I think he might have to stick around.

1796
01:46:43.611 --> 01:46:45.340
I'm not certain because if for a while he wanted,

1797
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:49.140
I think he was asking permission to go to Florida when he first got released and

1798
01:46:49.141 --> 01:46:51.870
the Attorney General Florida was like,
no thanks.
To be fair though,

1799
01:46:51.871 --> 01:46:56.520
she was a blonde woman,
so she was scared.
Uh,
so too soon.
What?

1800
01:46:57.270 --> 01:47:00.030
No,
too soon with them.
It's a,
he's,

1801
01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:03.630
he's one of the weirdest cases in all of American pop culture history.

1802
01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:07.220
I mean he is one of the weirdest cases.
You know,

1803
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:10.750
there's a fantastic photo that someone made a meme of,

1804
01:47:10.751 --> 01:47:14.880
of Howard Cosell with Bruce Jenner on one side,

1805
01:47:14.881 --> 01:47:18.590
and then Oj Simpson on his other side,
and Howard Cosell say,

1806
01:47:18.591 --> 01:47:20.970
and I've seen the future,
you're not going to fucking believe this

1807
01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:29.720
because it is so god damn crazy that one of the most famous and beloved people

1808
01:47:29.881 --> 01:47:34.680
forget before that murdered,
be loved.
I mean,
he was like the rock.

1809
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:39.210
Oh,
absolutely.
Right.
In that,
and a lot of ways,
maybe even,
maybe even,

1810
01:47:39.930 --> 01:47:44.250
I don't want to say more below the rocks,
pretty beloved,
but that level,
I mean,

1811
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:48.780
endorsements,
Hertz,
rental car ads.
He was in movies.

1812
01:47:49.290 --> 01:47:51.720
He was loved him.
Beloved personality,

1813
01:47:53.630 --> 01:47:57.990
Gun trilogy,
you know,
and,
and uh,
and well,
it was inevitable.

1814
01:47:57.991 --> 01:48:01.380
He would wind up in Florida of course.
But,
but like,
um,
crazy,

1815
01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:06.690
just crazy.
And this is something that in the end,
not to spoil it,

1816
01:48:07.050 --> 01:48:11.400
you've been so,
so kind to not spoil,
screwball.
Uh,
but in the end,

1817
01:48:11.401 --> 01:48:15.810
that's also part of the message is the idea that and why we use the children.

1818
01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:21.870
These athletes are heroes to these kids.

1819
01:48:22.110 --> 01:48:23.160
They look up to them.

1820
01:48:23.190 --> 01:48:28.190
These are supposedly role models and how many professional athletes do you know

1821
01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:33.720
who you'd be like,
I want my kids to idolize this,

1822
01:48:34.110 --> 01:48:37.830
this person.
Like legitimately like legitimately very few.
Sure.

1823
01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:41.730
So it's like that's the,
and that's where that whole sort of like lie,
cheat,

1824
01:48:41.731 --> 01:48:43.110
steal to get ahead.

1825
01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:46.780
Message I think is what's what we're teaching our children these days.
And,

1826
01:48:46.781 --> 01:48:50.160
and that's the case with like Oj Simpson.
It's like this key.

1827
01:48:50.161 --> 01:48:54.600
People idolize that guy.
So did they retire?
Did a rod retire?

1828
01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:56.130
Did he ever come back from this?

1829
01:48:56.370 --> 01:48:59.760
I don't know anything about base for one season he did for one season,

1830
01:48:59.761 --> 01:49:04.410
he came back,
he got the largest suspension in the history of the game,

1831
01:49:04.411 --> 01:49:07.620
but they reduced it,
right?
They reduced it,
but it remained the largest.

1832
01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:11.610
So how misspent James or was it a year?
He was like 160 it was almost like a,

1833
01:49:11.611 --> 01:49:14.580
basically a full season.
And the following season he came back,

1834
01:49:15.210 --> 01:49:17.520
played about another year if from where he was injured for a while.

1835
01:49:17.521 --> 01:49:18.001
I think you actually,

1836
01:49:18.001 --> 01:49:20.430
you might have been injured the following year and then came back the year after

1837
01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:24.510
and then he retired and the Yankees made him like,

1838
01:49:25.590 --> 01:49:27.960
they gave them like a fun office job where he would mentor.

1839
01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:30.900
Young players really can't make this shit up.
Didn't really,

1840
01:49:30.901 --> 01:49:35.901
yeah that is so interesting that he didn't become persona non grata like Jose

1841
01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:41.310
Canseco did.
Right.
It's,
I don't know how quite how to explain it and listen,

1842
01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:43.380
it's been one of the greatest,

1843
01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:48.560
I think reputation rebuilders not even rebuild.

1844
01:49:48.561 --> 01:49:51.310
I remember he was hated Nike Spans used to boo the guy.

1845
01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:55.250
He was not a beloved figure as a baseball player.
Now he's like,

1846
01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:59.020
maybe my mom knows who he is.
I mean she calls him jail,
his boyfriend,

1847
01:49:59.021 --> 01:50:01.870
but she knows the bottom line is she knows like he,
this,

1848
01:50:01.930 --> 01:50:06.610
I mean I think they're going to be studying this case study of like image Rehab

1849
01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:11.250
is going to be studied for like decades to come and like PR classes calculated.

1850
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:14.650
I think it was a lot of it was accidental but,
but like look at,

1851
01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:19.840
he's never even apologized or really admitted what he did.

1852
01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:23.110
He never went on like the mayor Kulpa tour.
Like Lance Armstrong,

1853
01:50:23.290 --> 01:50:27.060
Lance Armstrong is positive.
No,
he never failed a test time.
Yeah.

1854
01:50:27.070 --> 01:50:31.690
See that's part of it.
He was on this shady doctors dockets.

1855
01:50:32.170 --> 01:50:36.700
How the fuck did the doctor use the right name?
That's,
that's what's so crazy.

1856
01:50:36.701 --> 01:50:39.370
Like why did you use his name?
What do you mean?

1857
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:44.500
Why did you use a Rodriguez?
How about use a pseudonym?
Well,

1858
01:50:44.530 --> 01:50:48.080
if you remember,
Tony was doing a lot of cocaine at the time and he was like,

1859
01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:51.220
he was like in s in a fucking spiral.

1860
01:50:51.221 --> 01:50:54.460
His whole life was know he was about to hit rock bottom while he was running

1861
01:50:54.461 --> 01:50:56.800
this business.
And what's funny is to his medical records,

1862
01:50:56.830 --> 01:51:01.450
there was some file folders,
but a lot of them were in composition books,

1863
01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:05.350
like just old school cvs.
Like,
like do you use to the movies that,

1864
01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:08.190
so that's why that's the,
I cannot keep wrote in and he would scribble it.

1865
01:51:08.190 --> 01:51:08.890
And so those were beings.

1866
01:51:08.890 --> 01:51:13.630
But he'd write patient nicknames and dose and then some of it would just be like

1867
01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:18.160
stream of consciousness,
like middle school girl,
like journal.

1868
01:51:18.190 --> 01:51:20.920
Like he would write his name and different fonts.

1869
01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:23.800
He would come up with different like business ideas and plans and,

1870
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:26.650
and make signs,
you know,
for like his businesses and,

1871
01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:30.400
and talk about motivational speaking ideas that he had.
And it was like,

1872
01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:32.410
it's a real journey into,

1873
01:51:32.411 --> 01:51:36.160
into his mind if a cocaine addicted fake doctor in Miami,

1874
01:51:37.050 --> 01:51:41.990
which is an interesting journey,
I gotta tell Ya.
Um,
but like he,
uh,

1875
01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:46.720
so these composition books on some pages there'd be like code names.

1876
01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:50.890
Like,
um,
you know,
uh,
he had a guy that was like,
you know,

1877
01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:54.760
that he would name after cars are named after you like me hoe or little Spanish

1878
01:51:54.761 --> 01:51:58.810
words or,
or things like that.
Um,
he had,
uh,
uh,

1879
01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:00.740
a player when he bought,
he bought him like,
Hey,

1880
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:02.590
you bought him an SUV of some kind.
So he like,
you know,

1881
01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:05.680
code named them like Tahoe or whatever the fucking car was,
you know,

1882
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:09.040
another one was Dui because he had just gotten a Dui.
So that was like,

1883
01:52:09.670 --> 01:52:14.320
but then like after a while he just kind of abandoned it and then was like a

1884
01:52:14.321 --> 01:52:16.120
Rodriguez or Alex Rodriguez,
by the way,

1885
01:52:16.121 --> 01:52:18.580
there's a shit ton of Alex Rodriguez is in Miami.

1886
01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:22.510
But when you start seeing a rod in the books,

1887
01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:25.630
kind of kind of a tale,
you know,
a little bit,

1888
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:30.060
Jesus Christ,
he's just got sloppy,
you know,
like fucking drug addicts.

1889
01:52:30.061 --> 01:52:34.480
What does that can I do now?
Um,
well he's five,
five years off,
uh,

1890
01:52:34.481 --> 01:52:36.130
off of cocaine,
which is good.

1891
01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:39.280
He went to federal prison and rightfully so for the kids,

1892
01:52:39.310 --> 01:52:41.410
for the high school kids that he,
uh,
that he had when the,

1893
01:52:41.411 --> 01:52:44.290
when the judge sentenced him specifically said,
you know,

1894
01:52:44.610 --> 01:52:47.240
it's one thing consenting adults to engage in this behavior.

1895
01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:49.790
It's another thing for you to drag kids into this mess,

1896
01:52:50.090 --> 01:52:54.830
Aman and potentially poison them.
Um,
so he went to federal prison,
get this,

1897
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:57.500
he winds up in a camp.

1898
01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:01.310
So it's like minimum security federal prison in Alabama.

1899
01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:05.650
And he winds up teaching in part a,

1900
01:53:06.570 --> 01:53:09.440
a nutrition class to his fellow inmates.

1901
01:53:10.490 --> 01:53:15.490
He's in there with Jeff Skilling of Enron who's teaching a business class to his

1902
01:53:16.671 --> 01:53:21.671
fellow mates and Jesse Jackson Jr who's teaching a political science and civics

1903
01:53:21.711 --> 01:53:24.020
course to their fellow inmates.
They say prisons,

1904
01:53:24.021 --> 01:53:28.760
the best place to to learn and that cabin.
So we actually,

1905
01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:30.170
so one of my,
you know,

1906
01:53:30.171 --> 01:53:33.680
we were running out of money on this movie and so as you always do with movies

1907
01:53:33.681 --> 01:53:37.610
and,
and so there's a couple of scenes that we wanted to do that we ran out,

1908
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:39.980
we just couldn't do,
we had to cut them from the schedule.

1909
01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:43.470
So one of them was an epilogue with all the kids in federal prison,

1910
01:53:43.471 --> 01:53:47.090
like jumpsuits and like Tony Teaching and like a little baby,

1911
01:53:47.091 --> 01:53:50.690
Jesse Jackson Jr a little baby Jeff Skilling from Enron,
a little baby.

1912
01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:54.470
And another thing,
another thing Bosch was doing is he was like,

1913
01:53:54.471 --> 01:53:58.010
you see him at the beginning of the movie sitting at the bar at the Ritz Carlton

1914
01:53:58.011 --> 01:54:02.240
and key Biscayne and he's writing little protocols on a fucking cocktail Napkin

1915
01:54:02.241 --> 01:54:04.580
for the bartenders on how to build muscle,
how to lose weight.

1916
01:54:04.581 --> 01:54:09.581
So he was doing that in prison for inmates for like vitamins and supplements

1917
01:54:11.511 --> 01:54:15.410
that they could buy in the commissary.
He would like,
he'd be like,
hey Yo,
Dr t,

1918
01:54:15.411 --> 01:54:18.500
I want to,
I want to,
I'm trying to build muscle mass and be like,
okay,
here,

1919
01:54:18.501 --> 01:54:19.160
here's the program.

1920
01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:22.820
Go to the commissary by these vitamins and these sublet and there you take it

1921
01:54:22.821 --> 01:54:25.610
this time that Yo Tony,
I'm looking to lose weight.
What do I do?

1922
01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:29.390
And you give them,
and then doors started coming to him like,
Hey,
I'm looking at,

1923
01:54:29.391 --> 01:54:33.500
my wife wants to lose some weight or weight.
Yeah.
He'd give him protocols.
Wow.

1924
01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:35.570
Yeah.
So I mean,
he's very,

1925
01:54:35.571 --> 01:54:39.610
I told you he's very much a true believer in himself.
Um,

1926
01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:44.680
he's got a lot of faith in himself and he for a while was planning on opening a

1927
01:54:47.481 --> 01:54:52.481
nutritional supplement business across the street from Marlins Park in my Miami

1928
01:54:53.331 --> 01:54:56.390
posts or billion.
Like this is pretty recently.
It hasn't happened yet,

1929
01:54:56.391 --> 01:55:00.920
but like he's looking around for new,
for new opportunity.
And Miami is a,

1930
01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:04.310
is a land of,
of,
of new opportunity.
I told you this last time,

1931
01:55:04.311 --> 01:55:08.840
I saw you that it's an old saying that I love that La is where you go and you

1932
01:55:08.841 --> 01:55:09.770
want to be somebody.

1933
01:55:09.810 --> 01:55:13.070
New York is where you go when you are somebody and Miami's where you go and you

1934
01:55:13.071 --> 01:55:17.510
want to be somebody else.
It's just,
it's not only a town of reinvention,

1935
01:55:17.511 --> 01:55:20.240
it's like,
it just always been a sunny place for shady people.

1936
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:25.330
I just always wanted to know what happens to a fake doctor who gets both selling

1937
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:29.930
steroids to kids.
What does that guy do for a living afterwards?
I think now he's,

1938
01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:33.160
I suspect now he's just sort of being,
you know,
uh,
uh,

1939
01:55:33.230 --> 01:55:35.360
a subsidized by family and friends right now.

1940
01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:38.750
He does have kids and child support.
Probably it to make some how,

1941
01:55:38.751 --> 01:55:40.360
I don't know exactly what he's up to.
I'll,

1942
01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:42.560
I'll ask him the next time I'm gonna see him this weekend.

1943
01:55:42.570 --> 01:55:46.050
It's a Q A's ghost towns.
Oh yeah,
he does.

1944
01:55:46.170 --> 01:55:50.280
And he's quite squared funny.
He's quite a sobering.
Um,

1945
01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:53.510
well I think you still drinks,
but he doesn't,
he doesn't do,
uh,

1946
01:55:53.690 --> 01:55:58.410
Carlos it trucks anymore.
Yeah.
And that was,
uh,
that was,
that was bad for awhile.

1947
01:55:58.710 --> 01:56:01.450
Yeah,
I'm sure.
Yeah,
that's always the,
uh,

1948
01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:06.210
the bad decision making route.
What's,
what's funny about this is that he,

1949
01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:09.540
so we caught him like on his way into federal prison originally.

1950
01:56:09.541 --> 01:56:11.580
So in November of 2013,

1951
01:56:11.610 --> 01:56:15.270
Alex was in the midst of the arbitration that you see at the end of that,

1952
01:56:15.271 --> 01:56:20.271
we portray at the end of the movie in Mol MLBs offices in Manhattan and we get a

1953
01:56:21.481 --> 01:56:25.440
call from his publicist and his publicist says,
Yo were,

1954
01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:30.060
Alex is on a break from the arbitration and he's coming down to Miami.

1955
01:56:30.061 --> 01:56:32.970
He's got an office in coral gables,
which is just like very wealthy,

1956
01:56:32.971 --> 01:56:33.930
affluent suburb.

1957
01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:37.340
I'm adjacent to the city of Miami and it's actually the city where the

1958
01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:41.280
University of Miami's located,
where Alex Rodriguez field is at UNM on campus.

1959
01:56:41.281 --> 01:56:42.900
And so they said,
listen,

1960
01:56:43.470 --> 01:56:47.730
Alex would like to meet with you to talk about possibly doing some kind of tell

1961
01:56:47.731 --> 01:56:51.600
all documentary,
Jeez,
this is November,
2013.

1962
01:56:52.050 --> 01:56:55.380
So I'm like,
yes,
please.
Yeah.

1963
01:56:55.410 --> 01:56:58.170
So I figured like this is a hush hush meeting.

1964
01:56:58.171 --> 01:57:00.540
You know we're going to do this on the,
at his office in Coral Gables,

1965
01:57:00.541 --> 01:57:04.110
they say meet us some day,

1966
01:57:04.830 --> 01:57:07.440
high noon at Hillstone restaurant,

1967
01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:10.830
which is the power lunch spot in that neighborhood.

1968
01:57:11.970 --> 01:57:16.860
The most prominent corner in the city,
Florida ceiling windows,

1969
01:57:17.130 --> 01:57:17.970
open kitchen.

1970
01:57:17.971 --> 01:57:21.870
Everybody from the street to the dishwasher can see everything going on in that

1971
01:57:21.871 --> 01:57:25.050
dining room.
They want to meet us there at noon.

1972
01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:29.340
So I'm like Oh okay we go there,
slammed every seat taken.

1973
01:57:29.550 --> 01:57:32.700
Mob scene around the host stand three,
four deep at the bar.

1974
01:57:33.630 --> 01:57:36.180
They a scored us down the center.

1975
01:57:36.210 --> 01:57:40.560
Me and my producer Alford Spellman right down the center aisle parade us

1976
01:57:40.561 --> 01:57:44.040
practically and you know ESPN and the 30 for 30 [inaudible].

1977
01:57:44.041 --> 01:57:45.780
They really fetishized the directors.

1978
01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:48.990
So like they have like video interviews with us like you know in bumpers like

1979
01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:53.670
every hour,
like little little segments.
And so people sometimes recognize me,

1980
01:57:53.671 --> 01:57:57.780
usually in Miami,
like close to you em.
Cause we did the u m you know doc.

1981
01:57:57.781 --> 01:58:00.960
So if there's any play,
any place I was going to be recognized.

1982
01:58:00.961 --> 01:58:02.910
It was two miles from the University of Miami.

1983
01:58:02.970 --> 01:58:07.970
And so the tickets right down the middle and they're in the center booth on this

1984
01:58:10.261 --> 01:58:13.500
elevated platform around the back is Alex Rodriguez holding court.

1985
01:58:14.070 --> 01:58:14.530
And we literally,

1986
01:58:14.530 --> 01:58:19.530
so we literally have to like step up on stage to join him and like all eyes are

1987
01:58:19.591 --> 01:58:23.510
on us in this place and I don't know what to do.

1988
01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:26.850
We kind of get introduced and I,
I need like an icebreaker.
So I'm like,

1989
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:32.190
so who's going to call page six?
You are us.
Sure.
Shit.

1990
01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:33.840
Two weeks later it was in page six.

1991
01:58:34.050 --> 01:58:38.370
And so we sit there and um,
Alex didn't laugh.

1992
01:58:38.371 --> 01:58:42.250
The publicists laugh.
That's like a publicist joke,
you know?
I guess so.
Um,

1993
01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:46.180
because it was clear that we were there to be seen having this meeting.

1994
01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:49.870
It was so clear.
Why do you think they did the,
it was,

1995
01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:54.460
it was part of Alex's when you said,
was there a plan?
There was kind of a plan.

1996
01:58:54.700 --> 01:58:55.720
It was part of Alex's,

1997
01:58:55.721 --> 01:59:00.721
like up PR offensive or push back against major league baseball.

1998
01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:06.190
And so,
um,
we sat there with him for almost an hour and a half and he just lied,

1999
01:59:06.430 --> 01:59:08.650
just lied to us on the whole time.

2000
01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:12.760
And I didn't know that a lot of about everything.
I never met Tony Bosch.

2001
01:59:12.761 --> 01:59:14.960
This is all,
but you look at my records,
I,
you know,
I,
I,

2002
01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.190
my performance didn't improve after the time he claims to have been treating me.

2003
01:59:18.490 --> 01:59:23.110
I'm not a baseball fan on my cue.
To me the,
I call it screen saver.
All right.

2004
01:59:23.170 --> 01:59:26.740
I just,
but my producing partner Alfred is a degenerate baseball fan.

2005
01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:29.710
He gets to look the fucking mlb.com package has it on his desk,

2006
01:59:29.711 --> 01:59:33.190
on his iPad all day long during the season.
I'm just like,

2007
01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:35.440
I mean I guess he does that instead of Ambien.
You know,

2008
01:59:35.441 --> 01:59:38.560
it's like less sleep eating with baseball I guess.
I Dunno.
So he's just like,

2009
01:59:38.890 --> 01:59:41.800
but he's a huge baseball fan and when I left I was like,

2010
01:59:41.801 --> 01:59:43.610
he made a lot of good points.
Alex did off.

2011
01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:47.530
It's like fucking lied about everything and I can't blame him.

2012
01:59:47.531 --> 01:59:49.620
He lied to everybody in those days.
I mean,
he was in a,

2013
01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:53.960
he was desperately trying to salvage his,
his career and his legacy and he,
he,

2014
01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:56.740
he allegedly lied to the DEA in a queen for a day meeting.

2015
01:59:56.741 --> 02:00:00.370
Who the fuck lies in a queen for a day meeting other than George Papadopoulos.

2016
02:00:00.371 --> 02:00:01.310
I mean,
you're split.

2017
02:00:01.390 --> 02:00:03.510
The whole point is you're supposed to tell the truth that they're not gonna

2018
02:00:03.790 --> 02:00:06.160
gonna fuck with you.
Um,
but,
but he allegedly did that.

2019
02:00:06.161 --> 02:00:09.340
So it was a queen for a day meeting.
So Queen for a day,
meeting with the feds,

2020
02:00:09.341 --> 02:00:10.720
you get a letter for it.
They're like,

2021
02:00:11.110 --> 02:00:14.800
we're investigating w you're a witness in an investigation.

2022
02:00:15.550 --> 02:00:20.550
We understand you may have participated in some illegality or committed some

2023
02:00:20.681 --> 02:00:25.600
crimes in the course of this larger investigation,
but we're not after you.

2024
02:00:25.630 --> 02:00:26.920
We just want you to come in,

2025
02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:31.630
feel comfortable and free to tell the truth to our investigators so that we can

2026
02:00:31.930 --> 02:00:36.190
pursue our investigation accurately and fairly.
And we will not,

2027
02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:37.031
whatever,

2028
02:00:37.031 --> 02:00:40.690
anything you say will not be held against you essentially in a court of law.

2029
02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:42.580
So you're queen for a day,
they call it,

2030
02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:45.760
you get a letter or queen for a day letter and the hawks,
they call it,

2031
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:50.740
they call it queen for a day.
And so I don't,
that's the thing the feds have.

2032
02:00:50.770 --> 02:00:55.330
And so Alex was free to just speak.

2033
02:00:55.450 --> 02:00:59.500
The only thing you can do is lie to a federal agent that is a crime.

2034
02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:00.371
And that is in fact,

2035
02:01:00.371 --> 02:01:03.610
I think with George Papadopoulos was ultimately he lied in his queen for a day

2036
02:01:03.611 --> 02:01:05.860
meeting.
The whole point of a queen for a day meeting is to test,

2037
02:01:05.861 --> 02:01:10.270
to not lie and not cause you can't get in trouble essentially for any crimes

2038
02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:12.760
that you admit they are about the investigation.

2039
02:01:12.761 --> 02:01:15.670
So that was the allegation is that he actually lied.
So I listen,

2040
02:01:15.671 --> 02:01:19.690
I'm a documentarian.
People lie to me for a living.
Um,
I'm fine with that.

2041
02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:22.900
Especially because they spelled my name right and page six and that shit was in

2042
02:01:22.901 --> 02:01:25.090
bold.
I don't have the juice to make that happen.
Alex is,

2043
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:27.970
Alex is publicists to have the juice to make,
to make that happen.

2044
02:01:27.971 --> 02:01:32.000
I was flattered that they,
you know,
write about me,
but like,
um,

2045
02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:33.670
but you didn't think that he was lying.

2046
02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:36.610
I suspected he wasn't telling us the whole truth,

2047
02:01:36.611 --> 02:01:41.420
but I thought he made some interesting points in Alpha to Alfred had was a

2048
02:01:41.421 --> 02:01:43.400
pitcher in high school,
North Miami Beach,

2049
02:01:43.401 --> 02:01:48.350
senior high go chargers and Alfred had actually pitched against Alex Rodriguez.

2050
02:01:48.351 --> 02:01:53.060
It's like one of his only more stories from his baseball years in high school,

2051
02:01:53.061 --> 02:01:56.000
right,
is that Alex was a senior at the Alpha,

2052
02:01:56.001 --> 02:01:59.600
was going to some sort of Ron Frasier,
a baseball camp,

2053
02:01:59.601 --> 02:02:03.560
had a u m and they did this summer league game and Alfred,

2054
02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:06.710
this is my eyes are glazing over and telling the story.

2055
02:02:06.711 --> 02:02:11.570
But like Alfred Alfred's pitches against a ride and who was already a senior

2056
02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:12.411
already a beast.

2057
02:02:12.411 --> 02:02:16.220
Everybody knew this guy was gonna was gonna go in the draft and be huge.

2058
02:02:16.221 --> 02:02:17.300
Everybody knew about that.

2059
02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:21.020
He had been the talk of the high school baseball community in Miami forever.

2060
02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:26.120
And so Alfred pitched against him and he held a rod to a triple.

2061
02:02:26.150 --> 02:02:29.270
Of course Alec,
you know,
a red smack,
the shit out of this ball sailed away.

2062
02:02:29.271 --> 02:02:32.420
But he,
he was,
it was only a triple,
it wasn't,
it was a rare,

2063
02:02:32.421 --> 02:02:36.680
not home run for Alex.
So I thought,
oh,
we have like a funny personal anecdote.

2064
02:02:36.681 --> 02:02:38.660
Like we can find some common ground here,
right?

2065
02:02:38.661 --> 02:02:41.630
You're talking to someone who might be a potential interview subject,
you know?

2066
02:02:41.631 --> 02:02:44.120
And so I'm like,
actually Alex,

2067
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:46.670
you and Alfred have met before Alpha rolls his eyes.

2068
02:02:46.671 --> 02:02:50.420
Like he's going to embarrass me until this dumb shit story.
So I tell out like,

2069
02:02:50.421 --> 02:02:52.010
isn't this funny like you guys,
but,

2070
02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:57.160
and Alfred held you to a triple and he kind of looked at me like,

2071
02:02:57.261 --> 02:02:58.760
you're looking at me right now.
He's just,

2072
02:02:59.090 --> 02:03:04.090
he was totally on amused and maybe looked even a little hurt or offended.

2073
02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:07.550
Oh Wow.
This is the greatest baseball,

2074
02:03:07.551 --> 02:03:09.020
one of the greatest baseball players of all time,

2075
02:03:09.021 --> 02:03:11.480
the highest paid baseball player in history.

2076
02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:16.250
And here I'm just telling this cute story from like 20 years earlier whenever.

2077
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:20.360
And he seemed like he held me to a triple.
I'm like,

2078
02:03:20.361 --> 02:03:24.050
how could you be upset about that?
You're one of the greatest of all time,

2079
02:03:24.051 --> 02:03:28.460
like super winners.
But it's like,
yeah,
it's,
it's,
that's why I left.
I was like,

2080
02:03:28.461 --> 02:03:31.760
this guy's a really interesting character.
Like he's a complicated guy.

2081
02:03:31.761 --> 02:03:35.390
He's an interesting guy.
He's a sensitive guy.
Like I was curious about him.

2082
02:03:35.391 --> 02:03:39.290
I was excited about the prospect of interviewing him and man,

2083
02:03:39.530 --> 02:03:42.890
they practically ghosted us out.
Yeah.
The January of 2014,

2084
02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:45.050
that's when they lowered,
they reduce the suspension.

2085
02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:46.580
I started hitting up every month.

2086
02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:49.550
I started hitting up the publicist yo following up on that meeting,

2087
02:03:50.770 --> 02:03:51.501
because it's funny,

2088
02:03:51.501 --> 02:03:54.680
in the page six article it mentioned he met with the 30 for 30 filmmakers,

2089
02:03:54.681 --> 02:03:56.060
Billy Corbin outfits,
Spellman.
Uh,

2090
02:03:56.061 --> 02:03:58.970
he's been shopping a book proposal to these publishers.

2091
02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:01.880
The book proposal thing was total bunk.
Literally not true.
The,

2092
02:04:02.070 --> 02:04:04.940
the publishers were like,
we'd love to get one,

2093
02:04:04.941 --> 02:04:07.070
but we haven't gotten a book proposal from a Rod.

2094
02:04:07.071 --> 02:04:09.830
He really did have the meeting with us,
but like,
so everything was just,

2095
02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:13.760
we were just kind of pawns in his game,
which is cool.
Whatever they respond to.

2096
02:04:13.761 --> 02:04:17.450
This documentary?
Not exactly,
but I,

2097
02:04:17.630 --> 02:04:18.920
for like six or seven months,

2098
02:04:18.921 --> 02:04:21.560
I'm emailing with the publicist and then it was clear that they weren't

2099
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:25.040
interested.
So,
and that became the tactic,
by the way,

2100
02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:26.210
when you said was there a strategy,

2101
02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:30.650
the strategy was to shut the fuck up and just like,
like you said,

2102
02:04:30.651 --> 02:04:34.970
like with the president,
Big New York Times as big [inaudible] Expo Day.

2103
02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:40.240
And then maybe if we just tomorrow in this 24 hour news cycle in this fucking,

2104
02:04:40.261 --> 02:04:43.470
in this world of just being us being hammered with bad news,
you know,

2105
02:04:43.471 --> 02:04:48.420
in 240 characters,
every nanosecond of every day,
just shit just passes.

2106
02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:52.800
And they just,
they,
they played it just so,
so beautifully and brilliantly.

2107
02:04:52.801 --> 02:04:57.000
And then almost a year later,
we got a call from a friend of Tony Bosch.

2108
02:04:57.450 --> 02:04:58.530
You guys want to meet with 20 bucks?

2109
02:04:58.531 --> 02:05:02.160
She wants to talk to you about doing a documentary.
Like,
hell yeah.

2110
02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:03.450
So we take the meeting,

2111
02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:06.150
really interesting guy when would meet with them several times over several

2112
02:05:06.150 --> 02:05:09.420
months.
And then he says,
listen,
I want to do this interview goes,

2113
02:05:09.421 --> 02:05:11.910
I'm getting sentenced to prison tomorrow.

2114
02:05:13.110 --> 02:05:17.300
And we knew about that,
you know,
that the case was ongoing.
Um,

2115
02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:18.773
he said,
but look,

2116
02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:23.700
I expect the judge will give me 45 to 60 days to surrender to complete this drug

2117
02:05:23.701 --> 02:05:28.020
rehab program I'm in.
And then I'm only going to get like a year and a half,

2118
02:05:28.021 --> 02:05:29.400
two years in prison.

2119
02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:34.110
And so we could find a couple of days before I have to surrender to do this

2120
02:05:34.111 --> 02:05:38.220
interview and these,
and I'm like,
dude,
listen,
let's see what happens tomorrow.

2121
02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:40.980
I'll think depending on how much time the judge gives you,

2122
02:05:40.981 --> 02:05:43.440
like you're going to prison one way or another,

2123
02:05:43.441 --> 02:05:46.440
like maybe you want to spend some time with your kids,
get your affairs in order.

2124
02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:50.040
Let's make a decision tomorrow whether or not we're going to take two,
three,

2125
02:05:50.041 --> 02:05:53.810
four days out of your life for this,
maybe we'll do it.
When you get out into an,

2126
02:05:53.850 --> 02:05:57.510
you know,
in a year and a half years,
federal,
you do at least 80% of your time,

2127
02:05:57.511 --> 02:05:58.830
but then you go to halfway house.

2128
02:05:58.860 --> 02:06:02.400
Sometimes for a little bit at the end of six months or as long as a year.

2129
02:06:02.430 --> 02:06:06.360
So he goes,
he goes to court,

2130
02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:11.780
the judge says four years and you have not 45 to 60 days to surrender,

2131
02:06:12.211 --> 02:06:16.730
but 45 to 60 minutes to surrender.
Give me your,
you know,

2132
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:21.630
take off your belt and your shoe laces and surrender to a,
to the bop.
And he did.

2133
02:06:21.631 --> 02:06:25.560
And so the backburner it again.
And then I got to fucking email from Tim.

2134
02:06:25.561 --> 02:06:28.320
Al Frank,
who was the Woodward and Bernstein of the case,
he's the,

2135
02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:31.920
the journalist who got the stolen records from Porter Fisher,

2136
02:06:31.950 --> 02:06:34.230
the whistle blower and blew the lid off the whole thing.

2137
02:06:34.231 --> 02:06:36.000
At the beginning of 2013 he says to me,

2138
02:06:36.510 --> 02:06:39.990
Porter Fisher called me and he's asking me for your number to discuss,

2139
02:06:39.991 --> 02:06:44.280
possibly doing a documentary with you.
And I was like,
first of all,
like

2140
02:06:45.930 --> 02:06:49.200
we sometimes don't make documentaries about things that we make documentaries

2141
02:06:49.201 --> 02:06:51.660
about things that happened like 2030 40 years ago.

2142
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:55.230
This felt like it hadn't ripened yet.
Like it was still a fresh wound.
You know,

2143
02:06:55.231 --> 02:06:57.440
like people wouldn't be willing to talk,

2144
02:06:57.460 --> 02:07:00.300
like you have to kind of wait for more time to pass,
you know,

2145
02:07:00.301 --> 02:07:04.170
and here we are and I'm not a spiritual guy and I don't really believe in the

2146
02:07:04.171 --> 02:07:07.530
universe talking to me or anything,
but I thought,
man,

2147
02:07:07.890 --> 02:07:11.550
if ever someone was trying to tell us something,
it was like,

2148
02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:12.900
you got to make this documentary.

2149
02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:17.900
The three primary players in this major baseball scandal all independently of

2150
02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:20.010
each other,

2151
02:07:20.010 --> 02:07:25.010
contacted us within just over a year to talk about doing a documentary about at

2152
02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:30.600
night Alfred Jokes,
uh,
that um,
in Florida when you get out of prison,
uh,

2153
02:07:30.601 --> 02:07:33.330
your first call is to your mother,
your second calls to rack and toured,
who?

2154
02:07:33.331 --> 02:07:37.510
Our company,
you know,
to see the talk,
a documentary.
And Tony got out,

2155
02:07:37.511 --> 02:07:39.730
I hit up Tony,
I'm like,
I'll come visit you in Alabama.

2156
02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:42.370
How much time did you have to do?
And you wound up getting a sentence reduction.

2157
02:07:42.371 --> 02:07:46.930
He did just about two years.
And then he was in that camp in Alabama.
I wrote him,

2158
02:07:46.931 --> 02:07:49.090
I said,
dude,
I'm going to come up and visit you.
And had talked about this.

2159
02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:52.840
He said,
I'll be in a halfway house in six months,
so let's just meet in Miami.

2160
02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:53.920
I was like done.

2161
02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:56.920
And then when you meet porter and you meet Tony and you see them,

2162
02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:59.800
their interviews and the documentary,
you realize like,
well Alex,

2163
02:07:59.801 --> 02:08:01.780
this isn't even about Alex.
You know,
it was like,

2164
02:08:01.781 --> 02:08:05.140
this is about these guys in this crazy,
you know,

2165
02:08:05.141 --> 02:08:10.141
Carl Hiaasen s like Cohen brothers botched robbery like story.

2166
02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:14.440
And so like that was the story we wanted to tell and that was the Tony Porter

2167
02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:17.800
part of the story.
We'll listen dude.
You fucking nailed it.

2168
02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:20.500
It's a great documentary or really enjoyed it.

2169
02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:23.200
Like I really enjoy all of them and uh,

2170
02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:27.420
just keep on fucking knock it out of the park,
man.
Thank you.
A baseball metaphor.

2171
02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:30.850
I appreciate that.
Really appreciate it man.
Thanks for having me Joe.
