00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're back world,</v>

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I used to say America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but foreign people get upset for</v>

3
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>bastards living in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sad enough.</v>

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.820
<v Speaker 1>It can't be grace on our patch of dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I just had to explained to Cameron Hanes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when your iphone,</v>

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>when you use a bunch of Apps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you double click on that bottom button</v>

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows you all the apps that are</v>

8
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>running in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't know this.</v>

9
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Most people just use their phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 1>But that's a fucking resource,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert,</v>

11
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:30.414
<v Speaker 1>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>

12
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.470

<v Speaker 1>Be careful.</v>

13
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>I learned something today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to have to show people things.</v>

14
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Now when I'm showing you tech tips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>you know your tech retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little bit behind the curve.</v>

16
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>So what's happening brother?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you feeling,</v>

17
00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just ran 100 miles a week ago.</v>

18
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

19
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was about a week ago,</v>

20
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

22
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>it was last Saturday and Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So father's Day.</v>

23
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>All in preparation for a 200 mile run in</v>
<v Speaker 1>August.</v>

24
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Dude.</v>

25
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about today,</v>

26
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>like the mental games that your brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts playing on you.</v>

27
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you were describing all the shit</v>

28
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>that your brain starts doing to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're running.</v>

29
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always.</v>

30
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>There's so many peaks and valleys when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you push yourself like that and it's uh,</v>

31
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about all the ways I</v>

32
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>could quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I could come up with an excuse to</v>

33
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 1>get out of this race and really I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>come,</v>

34
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>I could say anything because who's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's gonna ever questioned it because</v>

35
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:33.721
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

36
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>how many people have ever run for 24</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight hours.</v>

37
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>

38
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>you can't really question me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just I pushed myself.</v>

39
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>So I mean I couldn't live with myself if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quit the race,</v>

40
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:46.540
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not saying I wasn't thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how nice it would have been</v>

41
00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:47.374
<v Speaker 1>stopped running.</v>

42
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime you're working out,</v>

43
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you just think about a yoga</v>
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>

44
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>which is only 90 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

45
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 1>those last 20 minutes you totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about,</v>

46
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>it'd be so nice to just get the fuck out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this hot room.</v>

47
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Drinks cold water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you just power through now.</v>

48
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Multiply that times 24.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>And way harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

50
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>because you're running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're exhausted,</v>

51
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 1>you're in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even imagine I'm saying all</v>

52
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>these things and I'm just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

53
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.953
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

54
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

55
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I teamed up with a pretty good runner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jo Johann to start the race.</v>

56
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 1>He was getting a workout in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>he was pacing at the western states 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was this last weekend.</v>

58
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>

59
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to get a good workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>

60
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>oh cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can knock off a bunch of miles with</v>

61
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:31.560
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were running pretty fast pretty</v>

62
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>fast for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>when you have to run for 24 straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

64
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>But we knocked off 10 miles quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was running with him,</v>

65
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you run 10 miles,</v>

66
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done something and I'm thinking</v>

67
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 1>to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got 19 more miles.</v>

68
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.540
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I had already got a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>good workout and I hadn't even got</v>

69
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really felt like you were done and you</v>

70
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>had 90 miles left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

71
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

72
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 2>you talk about mental strength and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping,</v>

74
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.880
<v Speaker 2>keep hammering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

75
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just had to keep hammering daunting</v>

76
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what is it like when it's over?</v>

77
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 2>What is the feeling like when you cross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's 24 hours at times up,</v>

78
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 2>you look at your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your distance,</v>

79
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 2>102 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that feel like?</v>

80
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 2>It feels good most days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is just me,</v>

81
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 2>I can't expect anybody to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>relate to my screwed up mine,</v>

82
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 2>but I mean me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go run 15 miles,</v>

83
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.750
<v Speaker 2>get a good workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go home and an hour later I'm thinking I</v>

84
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 2>could have done more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not satisfied.</v>

85
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 2>So the big thing for me is when I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>done something like that for the one of</v>

86
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:52.531
<v Speaker 2>the few times throughout the year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel satisfied that I gave what I had.</v>

87
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just so brutal that you never</v>

88
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 2>feel like you could have done more.</v>

89
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:00.221
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

90
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:00.461
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

91
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I always think I could have been more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

92
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm disappointed with myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

93
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because in that race,</v>

94
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 2>and I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can try to have it make sense.</v>

95
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can be logical about it and I could</v>

96
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I went out really fast because I</v>

97
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 2>want it to be as miserable as possible</v>
<v Speaker 2>for as long as possible to prepare</v>

98
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 2>myself for the big foot 200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can say,</v>

99
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 2>well I ran super hard for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for hours hoping I was going to be</v>

100
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:26.100
<v Speaker 2>miserable for 20 and I knew my pace that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

101
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 2>would have been a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be slower and it'd be more painful</v>

102
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 2>but in the big picture to help me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

103
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.120
<v Speaker 2>but that's just words to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking I had a,</v>

104
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 2>I was in first place through 50 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

105
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did 50 miles and in eight hours.</v>

106
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.270
<v Speaker 2>And so I was on pace for a lot of miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a second place at a 62 miles and I was</v>

107
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 2>at 12 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had run,</v>

108
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I think 65 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm on pace for 130,</v>

109
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:58.980
<v Speaker 2>so I really died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>

110
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

111
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 2>I can use words and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

112
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a plan,</v>

113
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was part of being miserable and</v>

114
00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 2>preparing myself for a greater</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge,</v>

115
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 2>but I also feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

116
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.440
<v Speaker 2>I gave up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm miles and I could gotten my most</v>

117
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 2>miles ever and I should have got 120</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus miles.</v>

118
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.520
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always the feeling I could have</v>

119
00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 2>done more even even though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm a little bit satisfied</v>

120
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're at the end of it.</v>

121
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

122
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 2>you're killing it at 50 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in first place.</v>

123
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.340
<v Speaker 2>And then is it just simply a matter of</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just muscle fatigue and pain and</v>

124
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 2>you're just saying for me can only push</v>
<v Speaker 2>so far?</v>

125
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't speak for anybody else probably</v>

126
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 2>for some people it's fatigue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people it's a just mental</v>

127
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 2>exhaustion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

128
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 2>for me it's pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just I've run and I did my first</v>

129
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:56.960
<v Speaker 2>marathon in 2002,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've been doing this for whatever,</v>

130
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 2>14 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

131
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 2>multiple marathons every year back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

132
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:07.451
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes my body is not 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can push,</v>

133
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 2>I have a high pain tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but eventually,</v>

134
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it adds up and so it's pain for me.</v>

135
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.740
<v Speaker 3>Is this a joint pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knees,</v>

136
00:06:19.741 --> 00:06:21.360
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it just the whole body?</v>

137
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.180
<v Speaker 3>It's waste down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hips,</v>

138
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.280
<v Speaker 3>knees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ankles,</v>

139
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.960
<v Speaker 3>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how long does it take you to</v>

140
00:06:27.961 --> 00:06:29.670
<v Speaker 3>recover?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you were telling me that your legs</v>

141
00:06:29.671 --> 00:06:31.830
<v Speaker 3>are swollen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twice the size of normal.</v>

142
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last year.</v>

143
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Last year was way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This year I had,</v>

144
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I've put in a bunch of miles leading up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was running about a half a marathon a</v>

145
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:42.490
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my body was,</v>

146
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 2>is pretty fit and pretty used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my recovery was much shorter.</v>

147
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

148
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.960
<v Speaker 2>people aren't going to understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the next day after I ran 102 I ran</v>

149
00:06:56.931 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 2>13 miles and that was just because when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I run the big foot 200,</v>

150
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to be able to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>back after,</v>

151
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple days of being hurt and banged</v>

152
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:08.840
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the name of the game,</v>

153
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cover 200 miles in a couple days,</v>

154
00:07:12.491 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 2>like I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be a hundred percent.</v>

155
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.260
<v Speaker 2>So I thought well I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't know what it feels like to run</v>

156
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:25.751
<v Speaker 2>after I run 100 miles and less one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I run a hundred miles and two,</v>

157
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.220
<v Speaker 2>I run the day after.</v>

158
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 2>So you can't simulate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way to simulate that.</v>

159
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:34.210
<v Speaker 2>So you ran 13 miles a day after you run</v>
<v Speaker 2>100,</v>

160
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.230
<v Speaker 2>two miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what the fuck is that like a,</v>

161
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 2>it'd be using the term loosely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was painful.</v>

162
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hiking the uphills running would</v>

163
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:46.020
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would,</v>

164
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 2>I probably looked like a 90 year old man</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to run it.</v>

165
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Fricken hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what are you legs?</v>

166
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Totally swollen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you doing this?</v>

167
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

168
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My uh,</v>

169
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.750
<v Speaker 2>my ankles are swollen and calves that</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really have an ankle.</v>

170
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:07.751
<v Speaker 2>It's the same size for my foot up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it's not good for me.</v>

171
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not in anybody who talks</v>
<v Speaker 2>about doing hundreds.</v>

172
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds aren't good for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

173
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.643
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

174
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 2>I know that what I do isn't in the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest of my body,</v>

175
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's just the name of the game is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do,</v>

176
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.470
<v Speaker 3>so what you do is not in the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>interest of your body.</v>

177
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 3>You understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're very aware of this and you're a</v>

178
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:34.841
<v Speaker 3>professional bowhunter essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have this thing in your head</v>

179
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.480
<v Speaker 3>where you have to push yourself as far</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as hard as possible to find out for</v>

180
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:45.581
<v Speaker 3>yourself to set goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try to push past this pain and</v>

181
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:48.950
<v Speaker 3>endurance barrier that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it all is?</v>

182
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to make sense of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's not like you're getting</v>

183
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:53.340
<v Speaker 3>paid to do these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

184
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 3>these are amateur race now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Getting at all.</v>

185
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 3>This</v>

186
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>is just for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to think I was an idiot for</v>

187
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 1>competing in martial arts matches for no</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

188
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

189
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.890
<v Speaker 1>but this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

190
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing this at 48 years old with a</v>

191
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:10.360
<v Speaker 1>family with a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

192
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>And you're still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:13.194
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

194
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 1>it's just what I feel like I need to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't.</v>

195
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 1>don't know how long you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to do this.</v>

197
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

198
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people have told me when I started</v>

199
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 1>doing marathons and running the mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>back home,</v>

200
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

201
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.950
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago,</v>

202
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 1>and people said then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

203
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 1>if you keep running like this by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time you're 40,</v>

204
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 1>you won't be able to run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here I am.</v>

205
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 1>They always say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

206
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just,</v>

207
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.820
<v Speaker 1>the point to point to that is I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really care.</v>

208
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do what I do for anybody else.</v>

209
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Just for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I need to do this.</v>

210
00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I like pushing my limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

211
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I would have listened to people</v>

212
00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 1>telling me what I shouldn't do or</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do or nobody could do,</v>

213
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have done hardly anything in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

214
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.070
<v Speaker 1>So the point is I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what anybody says,</v>

215
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what anybody thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

216
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 1>this is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to do it.</v>

217
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I like finding my absolute limit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing how much I can withstand and this</v>

218
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 1>is us offices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

219
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:20.250
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird thing that people always</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

220
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:24.000
<v Speaker 1>They have you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to kill you if you have debt.</v>

221
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.410
<v Speaker 1>It's going to break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

222
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Lifting weights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

223
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the people that lift weights</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually live shorter lives,</v>

224
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.043
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

225
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.270
<v Speaker 1>There's always this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that want to tell you to</v>

226
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:34.780
<v Speaker 1>not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

227
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.450
<v Speaker 1>like I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you doing it?</v>

228
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.820
<v Speaker 1>But I'm never going to tell you don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

229
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to that mentality that</v>

230
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.130
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of talking about this earlier</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

231
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something in some people</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they see someone doing something</v>

232
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:52.860
<v Speaker 1>crazy that they can't do and they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out there's got to be</v>

233
00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with you and they've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out a way to criticize you</v>

234
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.060
<v Speaker 1>instead of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

235
00:10:57.061 --> 00:10:59.250
<v Speaker 1>that guy's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or Wow,</v>

236
00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:00.640
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

237
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I respect,</v>

238
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 1>appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of doing that,</v>

239
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.750
<v Speaker 1>they try to like poke holes that may or</v>
<v Speaker 1>may not even be there.</v>

240
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.770
<v Speaker 1>They try to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of admitting that it's not</v>

241
00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 1>good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not kind of your 100 percent admitting</v>

242
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

243
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is good for you in one way you're</v>

244
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:26.060
<v Speaker 1>like your mind desires this extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge and that keeps you very calm</v>

245
00:11:28.141 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 1>and sane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See as your.</v>

246
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Speaker 1>You're the kind of guy where I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that didn't exist you would have like</v>

247
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:39.570
<v Speaker 1>real problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just integrating and relating to</v>

248
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>regular society probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

249
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what I would be like without the</v>

250
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:51.000
<v Speaker 1>challenge that I take on if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of me feels like if I didn't do</v>

251
00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:53.680
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be a shell of myself as far as</v>

252
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be living up to my ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My whole thing is like if I'm able to do</v>

253
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to attempt it.</v>

254
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.170
<v Speaker 2>I need to try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to do it.</v>

255
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean because I just think that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to live up to their full potential.</v>

256
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm doing.</v>

257
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Is there anything else though that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think is interesting like in that way,</v>

258
00:12:10.951 --> 00:12:13.710
<v Speaker 3>like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a competitive thing in some ways,</v>

259
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.360
<v Speaker 3>like because you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

260
00:12:15.361 --> 00:12:17.400
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm first place at 50 miles,</v>

261
00:12:17.401 --> 00:12:20.370
<v Speaker 3>but at some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere along the line it becomes</v>

262
00:12:20.371 --> 00:12:23.250
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pushing yourself and it becomes</v>

263
00:12:23.251 --> 00:12:26.910
<v Speaker 3>less of you in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not really engaging with someone</v>

264
00:12:26.911 --> 00:12:28.470
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you're racing them,</v>

265
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.660
<v Speaker 3>you really kind of all in your own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

266
00:12:30.661 --> 00:12:31.390
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>

267
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

268
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

269
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:39.630
<v Speaker 2>I look at it more of just a competition</v>
<v Speaker 2>with myself than with another race or,</v>

270
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.440
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or another person.</v>

271
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Of course if I'm running it would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool to be first,</v>

272
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just,</v>

273
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm a competitive person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt.</v>

274
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.260
<v Speaker 2>But what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my workouts are always by myself.</v>

275
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's pushing me.</v>

276
00:12:55.331 --> 00:13:00.190
<v Speaker 2>It's just me and setting the goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to run big foot $200 or whatever.</v>

277
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.660
<v Speaker 2>That's just me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

278
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might not even see anybody during that</v>

279
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:07.180
<v Speaker 2>whole race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was just like,</v>

280
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's 75 or so people signed</v>

281
00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:13.090
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to be probably pretty</v>

282
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 2>spread out pretty quickly just depending</v>
<v Speaker 2>on how fast people go out or do whatever</v>

283
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.430
<v Speaker 2>over 200 miles point to point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could go,</v>

284
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to complete days and not see anybody.</v>

285
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.821
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

286
00:13:25.821 --> 00:13:27.520
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really,</v>

287
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:31.210
<v Speaker 2>it's not like the Olympic 100 meter dash</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're lined up against,</v>

288
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight other guys and you see exactly</v>

289
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:35.100
<v Speaker 2>where everybody is at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

290
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.530
<v Speaker 2>this is more about a test of a personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>

291
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.753
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

292
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking today also,</v>

293
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.840
<v Speaker 3>we're a guy that we know who's a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>an expert and a lot of physical things</v>

294
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.130
<v Speaker 3>are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why don't you,</v>

295
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:49.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take epo,</v>

296
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 3>all these people that you're racing</v>
<v Speaker 3>against,</v>

297
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:53.800
<v Speaker 3>you'd probably take an epo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they're going to test you,</v>

298
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.173
<v Speaker 3>but you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

299
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.400
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] probably not going to help</v>
<v Speaker 3>me with pain.</v>

300
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know what EPA does,</v>

301
00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:05.371
<v Speaker 2>but all I know is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what limits me is just that pain.</v>

302
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.980
<v Speaker 2>So unless something can like make me</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally stronger,</v>

303
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's gonna help and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a race like that because it's not</v>

304
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:15.430
<v Speaker 2>like you're going super fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

305
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.240
<v Speaker 2>it's not like the pace is extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just grinding.</v>

306
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.900
<v Speaker 3>Those ultra marathon guys are seeking</v>
<v Speaker 3>help with edible marijuana.</v>

307
00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.800
<v Speaker 3>That's a big one lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And apparently it's a big with a lot of</v>

308
00:14:27.801 --> 00:14:32.801
<v Speaker 3>these ultra marathon guys were just</v>
<v Speaker 3>reduces inflammation in some way that</v>

309
00:14:32.901 --> 00:14:37.490
<v Speaker 3>they find very beneficial as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsteroidal anti inflammatories,</v>

310
00:14:37.491 --> 00:14:39.970
<v Speaker 3>which we'll probably get into to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was talking about that because the</v>

311
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.230
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda Patrick thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these ultra marathon guys,</v>

312
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that it's becoming more and more</v>

313
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.400
<v Speaker 3>acceptable to use cannabis as people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out and talking about it's,</v>

314
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:52.503
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

315
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that it benefits them</v>

316
00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 1>in that way because a Jujitsu people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been saying it for years that,</v>

317
00:14:59.421 --> 00:15:01.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people always associate marijuana with</v>

318
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.150
<v Speaker 1>you being lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with a lot of Jujitsu guys,</v>

319
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:08.510
<v Speaker 1>they find that it makes them more</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative and more tuned into what</v>

320
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:11.030
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also able to.</v>

321
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu can be pretty painful too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But although it's a different kind of</v>

322
00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:16.380
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pain in,</v>

323
00:15:16.381 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 1>in short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short exchanges or painful that you</v>

324
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:23.180
<v Speaker 1>don't want to tap and you fight your way</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of a choke or something like that.</v>

325
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.720
<v Speaker 1>But the grinding monotonous pain of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing is kind of a different kind</v>

326
00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:32.090
<v Speaker 1>of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I talk about what it would be like,</v>

327
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:33.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm just talking out of my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

328
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Well here's what I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I will say.</v>

329
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:41.470
<v Speaker 1>If somebody would offer me some edible</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis at mile 80 last weekend you had</v>

330
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.200
<v Speaker 1>taken it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

331
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.890
<v Speaker 1>I would have done almost anything to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the pain stop.</v>

332
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.280
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a regular job.</v>

333
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I get surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drug tests at work so often they</v>

334
00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:58.190
<v Speaker 1>surprised drug does to a god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even,</v>

335
00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

336
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once a year.</v>

337
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.640
<v Speaker 1>And what are they testing for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

338
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Just they just want your pee pee man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I'm not.</v>

340
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something fucked up about that</v>

341
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:16.250
<v Speaker 1>because it's one thing if you were doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a terrible job like yeah,</v>

342
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.610
<v Speaker 1>like say if you were like a a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>handles heavy machinery,</v>

343
00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:21.140
<v Speaker 1>you keep cutting off people's fingers</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

344
00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should test camp a fuck.</v>

345
00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Is he up to camps high as fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that.</v>

346
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just they just decided like even if</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job,</v>

347
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:34.820
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing your job well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still feel like they can test your</v>

348
00:16:34.821 --> 00:16:39.821
<v Speaker 1>body and find out what you're doing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also one of the real problems is</v>

349
00:16:40.201 --> 00:16:42.440
<v Speaker 1>it's rooted in ignorance because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

350
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.740
<v Speaker 1>if you have this stuff in your system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you smoke pot on a Friday,</v>

351
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:47.240
<v Speaker 1>you get off work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a joint,</v>

352
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.000
<v Speaker 1>go play baseball with your son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a good time.</v>

353
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're high on Monday when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you show up for it,</v>

354
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.980
<v Speaker 1>but it'll still be in your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

355
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.830
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making sure you're not doing</v>

356
00:16:57.831 --> 00:17:00.410
<v Speaker 1>anything that they don't like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not there.</v>

357
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really care personally because I</v>

358
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:06.680
<v Speaker 1>live a clean life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

359
00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:08.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't smoke,</v>

360
00:17:08.931 --> 00:17:10.160
<v Speaker 1>don't do whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

361
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.400
<v Speaker 1>so they can test whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think part of it is uh,</v>

362
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

363
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.620
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the best places to work in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the area.</v>

364
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.600
<v Speaker 1>So they figured that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

365
00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.500
<v Speaker 1>part of the stipulation of working here</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you're subjected to these drug tests.</v>

366
00:17:24.501 --> 00:17:26.570
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to work here.</v>

367
00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

368
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

369
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

370
00:17:30.561 --> 00:17:34.040
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying that they're probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>not testing for pot and thinking or I'm</v>

371
00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:37.070
<v Speaker 1>sure they are testing for pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's,</v>

372
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they test for alcohol.</v>

373
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.170
<v Speaker 1>I think metric test for alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they do.</v>

374
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.140
<v Speaker 1>You have to be drunk there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

375
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.740
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to be drunk out of a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to have a drink at lunch</v>

376
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.093
<v Speaker 1>and then they keep up</v>

377
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.090
<v Speaker 3>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

378
00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying people do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they could.</v>

379
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 3>But you could get hammered on Friday and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monday be clean as a whistle.</v>

380
00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.640
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

381
00:17:59.641 --> 00:18:02.890
<v Speaker 3>That when they always do it is they'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>call like it.</v>

382
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I start work at seven,</v>

383
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.300
<v Speaker 3>so it'd be like 7:15 he needed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he needed to be to wherever and 15</v>

384
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:12.780
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's just they don't want</v>

385
00:18:12.781 --> 00:18:15.000
<v Speaker 3>somebody out hammered drunk at three in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the morning.</v>

386
00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.750
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably still show up there at</v>
<v Speaker 3>7:30.</v>

387
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.810
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally makes sense.</v>

388
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that totally makes sense because yeah,</v>

389
00:18:20.281 --> 00:18:25.281
<v Speaker 3>you are compromised and even if you show</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and you're stoned at work for a lot</v>

390
00:18:25.381 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 3>of people that are compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand the idea that you would</v>

391
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:32.790
<v Speaker 3>want someone to not have a drug problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

392
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.770
<v Speaker 3>Because we all know people that have had</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems for me,</v>

393
00:18:35.771 --> 00:18:38.490
<v Speaker 3>like the most disturbing one has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that I know that a big pill</v>

394
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:41.970
<v Speaker 3>problems like speed and things along</v>
<v Speaker 3>those lines because a lot of the times</v>

395
00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:44.580
<v Speaker 3>they're functional but just a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

396
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.460
<v Speaker 3>And if you're dealing with important</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

397
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.680
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be making critical decision</v>

398
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.050
<v Speaker 3>errors and because you're impaired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

399
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.860
<v Speaker 3>So they might have hired you based on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your critical thinking and your</v>

400
00:18:55.861 --> 00:18:58.630
<v Speaker 3>reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then that's all being compromised by</v>

401
00:18:58.631 --> 00:19:02.130
<v Speaker 3>a drug and there's only one way to find</v>
<v Speaker 3>out what the fuck is going on with you</v>

402
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.790
<v Speaker 3>testing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

403
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

404
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.460
<v Speaker 3>The problem with the cannabis things to</v>
<v Speaker 3>twofold.</v>

405
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:08.910
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it stays in your system.</v>

406
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Your you can test for it for weeks and</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks after it's psychoactive because</v>

407
00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:18.531
<v Speaker 3>it's fat soluble and two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this assumption that if you use</v>

408
00:19:19.111 --> 00:19:24.111
<v Speaker 3>something you abuse something is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not accurate and it's only applies</v>

409
00:19:24.541 --> 00:19:26.610
<v Speaker 3>to losers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if you say,</v>

410
00:19:26.611 --> 00:19:28.530
<v Speaker 3>well look at all these losers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get high every day.</v>

411
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.180
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

412
00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:32.000
<v Speaker 3>But there are also losers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

413
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.100
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of responsible people.</v>

414
00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.770
<v Speaker 3>But when I say losers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean if you get high every day,</v>

415
00:19:37.771 --> 00:19:39.660
<v Speaker 3>you're a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know people that get high every day</v>

416
00:19:39.661 --> 00:19:43.230
<v Speaker 3>and they're super successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Businessman it guys.</v>

417
00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:47.430
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know people that micro dose Lsd all</v>

418
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:51.540
<v Speaker 3>the time and they run multimillion</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar businesses and they do it all the</v>

419
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:52.374
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

420
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:57.480
<v Speaker 3>But their personality is such that</v>
<v Speaker 3>recreationally,</v>

421
00:19:57.481 --> 00:20:01.530
<v Speaker 3>they don't have an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can do things and doesn't overwhelm</v>

422
00:20:01.531 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 3>their life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some people can't gamble.</v>

423
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.190
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people,</v>

424
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.850
<v Speaker 3>like if you play poker with some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll lose their fucking mind.</v>

425
00:20:08.851 --> 00:20:10.400
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're on a flight to vegas.</v>

426
00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.170
<v Speaker 3>They're going crazy and they lost their</v>
<v Speaker 3>mortgage is a disease.</v>

427
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a legitimate mental disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not in the sense that you catch it.</v>

428
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:17.731
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

429
00:20:17.731 --> 00:20:18.480
<v Speaker 3>I didn't wash my hands.</v>

430
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.710
<v Speaker 3>I caught Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

431
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:22.860
<v Speaker 3>it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a legitimate disease in the</v>

432
00:20:22.861 --> 00:20:27.861
<v Speaker 3>sense that it can fuck with your mind in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a way that is almost out of your</v>

433
00:20:28.351 --> 00:20:31.920
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a cold makes your physical health</v>

434
00:20:31.921 --> 00:20:33.900
<v Speaker 3>out of your control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I have a cold,</v>

435
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:36.330
<v Speaker 3>I get upset at myself because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking dummy.</v>

436
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.420
<v Speaker 3>You let yourself get rundown or I know</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't get enough sleep.</v>

437
00:20:39.421 --> 00:20:40.201
<v Speaker 3>You didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

438
00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:42.660
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You traveled too much and here you are.</v>

439
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 3>Now you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

440
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:44.800
<v Speaker 3>this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

441
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 3>well that's the sort of the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens people when they get a</v>

442
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.510
<v Speaker 1>gambling addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a substance thing.</v>

443
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

444
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cam,</v>

445
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.230
<v Speaker 1>we're going to test you for gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

446
00:20:56.231 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you play poker with your buddies</v>

447
00:20:57.581 --> 00:20:59.140
<v Speaker 1>over the weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much did you gamble?</v>

448
00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 bucks.</v>

449
00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

450
00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.220
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that to people.</v>

451
00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:05.740
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a,</v>

452
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:08.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a real problem with that and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

453
00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could say if you,</v>

454
00:21:10.511 --> 00:21:13.660
<v Speaker 1>if it's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the employer and you know,</v>

455
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:15.000
<v Speaker 1>this is the kind of people that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

456
00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.470
<v Speaker 1>It's up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

457
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

458
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say if the guy's doing a good job,</v>

459
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.320
<v Speaker 1>there should be no issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

460
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

461
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think there are a fair employer.</v>

462
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 1>So I think even if you did test for</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

463
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were that good employee,</v>

464
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.423
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

465
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.860
<v Speaker 1>they're going to work through whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues you're going to make.</v>

466
00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.890
<v Speaker 1>You go to Rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a bunch of losers maybe in sit</v>

467
00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:41.820
<v Speaker 1>around talking about pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine what it's like going to a</v>

468
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.410
<v Speaker 1>rehab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you smoke a little weed and you get</v>

469
00:21:44.411 --> 00:21:48.160
<v Speaker 1>popped at work and you got to go to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rehab with a bunch of stone cold</v>

470
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.770
<v Speaker 1>junkies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all covered in scabs,</v>

471
00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.190
<v Speaker 1>clonic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake spiders all day and or ultra</v>

472
00:21:54.191 --> 00:21:58.240
<v Speaker 1>marathon runners</v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about that.</v>

473
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Test me after the big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 places.</v>

474
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get you so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get you a ton of it.</v>

475
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I take a couple months off work after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

476
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a pre workout supplement that</v>

477
00:22:09.941 --> 00:22:12.490
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about on the way up here</v>
<v Speaker 1>to where they pulled it off the shelf</v>

478
00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:15.750
<v Speaker 1>because they found fucking meth in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Straight up meth.</v>

479
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like a meth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like substance that had never been</v>

480
00:22:18.971 --> 00:22:22.630
<v Speaker 1>tested on human beings and pull this</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit off the shelves.</v>

481
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.110
<v Speaker 1>I asked Joe what it was called</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

482
00:22:24.111 --> 00:22:27.000
<v Speaker 1>You know that stuff would work</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

483
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.010
<v Speaker 1>That stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get super addicted to that</v>

484
00:22:30.011 --> 00:22:31.310
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

485
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.810
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't like coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm probably addicted to coffee.</v>

486
00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love coffee.</v>

487
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Tea or coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coffee is.</v>

488
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is caveman coffee.</v>

489
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.800
<v Speaker 1>This is some delicious roast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind is this?</v>

490
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what roasted it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There?</v>

491
00:22:44.561 --> 00:22:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Was that saber tooth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it.</v>

492
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Is it the same thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the end of one,</v>

493
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.533
<v Speaker 1>I think it was at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

494
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

495
00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:52.060
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That delicious stuff with the silver</v>

496
00:22:52.061 --> 00:22:53.170
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

497
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.670
<v Speaker 1>That's good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

498
00:22:54.671 --> 00:22:58.690
<v Speaker 1>it's really good coffee as far as uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now I'm just trying to keep my</v>

499
00:22:58.691 --> 00:23:02.440
<v Speaker 1>body is pure as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even doing pre workout at all</v>

500
00:23:02.441 --> 00:23:04.980
<v Speaker 1>because I'm so cognizant of what my</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart's doing is.</v>

501
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm pushing it so hard every day and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>always got my heart rate monitor on.</v>

502
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Even during that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultra that I just did the 24 hour we</v>

503
00:23:13.881 --> 00:23:18.580
<v Speaker 1>were running fast and never got above</v>
<v Speaker 1>141 or 42 beats per minute.</v>

504
00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:23.710
<v Speaker 1>So I mean that when I take pre workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's going to ramp up my heart</v>

505
00:23:23.711 --> 00:23:26.770
<v Speaker 1>rate and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my work definitely doesn't have to</v>

506
00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:30.580
<v Speaker 1>worry about anything in me right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to stay calm,</v>

507
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.780
<v Speaker 1>stay a um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an efficient machine out there and</v>

508
00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling feeling good actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

509
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine if you took a pre</v>
<v Speaker 1>workout and you got pot from meth to</v>

510
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:41.980
<v Speaker 1>work and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey cam,</v>

511
00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:44.590
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eating healthy,</v>

512
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:48.620
<v Speaker 1>working out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking super jacked formula number six.</v>

513
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's test that meth head.</v>

514
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.110
<v Speaker 1>We have a real issue with that in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>

515
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.680
<v Speaker 1>There a real issue with guys taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>these supplements.</v>

516
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Chad Mendez is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the latest ones take these</v>

517
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:04.790
<v Speaker 1>supplements that you buy from stores and</v>
<v Speaker 1>these supplements turned out to have</v>

518
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:09.791
<v Speaker 1>either steroids or hormone precursors or</v>
<v Speaker 1>different peptides that make your body</v>

519
00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:14.480
<v Speaker 1>develop more testosterone or more growth</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone or different things that are</v>

520
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.930
<v Speaker 1>banned by the U.</v>
<v Speaker 1>S,</v>

521
00:24:15.931 --> 00:24:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Ada and a super common man.</v>

522
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Super Common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

523
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.900
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

524
00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.420
<v Speaker 1>people online would love project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

525
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.420
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a tainted supplement,</v>

526
00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.610
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually testing these</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements.</v>

527
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.770
<v Speaker 1>When these guys get caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like A,</v>

528
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.240
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tim means he's a perfect example.</v>

529
00:24:33.241 --> 00:24:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Like he was only suspended for a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>short amount of time.</v>

530
00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:39.020
<v Speaker 1>They give him six months retroactive to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day where he got caught.</v>

531
00:24:39.021 --> 00:24:41.690
<v Speaker 1>He was supposed to have this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing fight with cowboy serone.</v>

532
00:24:41.691 --> 00:24:42.860
<v Speaker 1>That would have been an incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

533
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it was super,</v>

534
00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:47.000
<v Speaker 1>super skillful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they take a,</v>

535
00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Tim means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

536
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.670
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tells them what the supplement was.</v>

537
00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Speaker 1>They go to a store independently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it off the shelf,</v>

538
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:53.330
<v Speaker 1>test it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>

539
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.060
<v Speaker 1>she up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure enough it has a steroid in it.</v>

540
00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.720
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of this stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are buying that they think is</v>

541
00:24:59.721 --> 00:25:00.830
<v Speaker 1>safe and easy.</v>

542
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.780
<v Speaker 1>If it works like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

543
00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.470
<v Speaker 1>if it's like I put on 10 pounds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours,</v>

544
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 1>there's some shit in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

545
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:13.100
<v Speaker 1>it's the stuff that works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>works a little bit where it's like a</v>

546
00:25:13.101 --> 00:25:14.570
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get like a little bit of an</v>

547

<v Speaker 1>advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything is everything that's</v>

548
00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 1>healthy and then legal that you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>use like creatine,</v>

549
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.140
<v Speaker 1>creatine works became like a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of a bump</v>

550
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.320
<v Speaker 1>and you can add a little bit of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of that and this stuff</v>

551
00:25:27.321 --> 00:25:29.630
<v Speaker 1>helps that netapp helped ain't take this</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you go to bed,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it'll help your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your growth hormone increase and that</v>

553
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:35.160
<v Speaker 1>stuff is like little incremental little</v>
<v Speaker 1>edges.</v>

554
00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.520
<v Speaker 1>It works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all works but a little bit.</v>

555
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that with complete nutrition.</v>

556
00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had some of that stuff and as you</v>

557
00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:46.040
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did a,</v>

558
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.160
<v Speaker 1>taking a few different things and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it worked,</v>

559
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.510
<v Speaker 1>it totally worked.</v>

560
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.430
<v Speaker 1>I definitely put on muscle and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dang,</v>

561
00:25:52.431 --> 00:25:54.710
<v Speaker 1>this stuff is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it got done,</v>

562
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.430
<v Speaker 1>went back in there like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh remember that stuff that is something</v>

563
00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Nova or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

564
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:01.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pulled that,</v>

565
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:03.380
<v Speaker 1>that's too strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

566
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's it.</v>

567
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it definitely worked.</v>

568
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.720
<v Speaker 1>The problem was a problem with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

569
00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:11.690
<v Speaker 1>like a young guys especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take whatever,</v>

570
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.480
<v Speaker 1>but that stuff is hard on your liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

571
00:26:14.481 --> 00:26:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Those supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going through your liver like that.</v>

572
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:20.960
<v Speaker 1>So it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also hard on your balls probably.</v>

573
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I took this stuff called Mag 10 bag 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the most powerful thing that I ever</v>

574
00:26:25.421 --> 00:26:27.230
<v Speaker 1>took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pulled that off the shelf.</v>

575
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You used to take 10 clear pills a day.</v>

576
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.330
<v Speaker 1>You just looked like a total pill head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

577
00:26:34.331 --> 00:26:38.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like a stack of these pills and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're clear and they probably like</v>

578
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:41.540
<v Speaker 1>super toxic on your liver from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

579
00:26:41.541 --> 00:26:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Did I get dragged to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did it work?</v>

580
00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

581
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.361
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

582
00:26:48.361 --> 00:26:50.240
<v Speaker 3>you're manipulating your hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

583
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 3>And it's tricky doing that is tricky</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to really be concerned</v>

584
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:58.611
<v Speaker 3>with taxing your endocrine system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your endocrine system shuts down because</v>

585
00:26:58.651 --> 00:26:59.041
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

586
00:26:59.041 --> 00:26:59.970
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does this guy have,</v>

587
00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this God damn extra testosterone.</v>

588
00:27:02.351 --> 00:27:03.540
<v Speaker 3>A system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess we don't have to make</v>

589
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:05.610
<v Speaker 3>testosterone anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so balls crash.</v>

590
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.190
<v Speaker 3>So your balls take a break and when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>balls go on vacation then it takes like</v>

591
00:27:09.191 --> 00:27:11.750
<v Speaker 3>a couple of weeks for them to get back</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to speed after you're up,</v>

592
00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.860
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you're on that stuff,</v>

593
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:15.960
<v Speaker 3>like say if you're on for like six</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>

594
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:21.060
<v Speaker 3>I think they say it takes like at least</v>
<v Speaker 3>three for your body to get back to</v>

595
00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:22.710
<v Speaker 3>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We bought it to let go.</v>

596
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:23.620
<v Speaker 3>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

597
00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 3>Really looks like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

598
00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:27.480
<v Speaker 3>it's like your balls are like a haunted</v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

599
00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody goes in and shines a</v>
<v Speaker 3>flashlight around.</v>

600
00:27:30.361 --> 00:27:30.860
<v Speaker 3>We.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

601
00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:34.170
<v Speaker 3>we'll go back to business now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck was going on in here?</v>

602
00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.750
<v Speaker 3>Is this guy taking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

603
00:27:36.751 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 3>your body's not used to you taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

604
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:44.420
<v Speaker 3>It's processed through your digestive</v>
<v Speaker 3>system and it's testosterone and all of</v>

605
00:27:44.421 --> 00:27:46.110
<v Speaker 3>a sudden you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>

606
00:27:46.111 --> 00:27:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Where's it coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it coming from the liver?</v>

607
00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.490
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this shit getting absorbed by</v>

608
00:27:50.491 --> 00:27:55.380
<v Speaker 3>your stomach and your intestines?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This crazy testosterone stuff.</v>

609
00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's better just eat elk.</v>

610
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.400
<v Speaker 3>That helps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That does help.</v>

611
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of different foods that</v>

612
00:28:02.281 --> 00:28:03.250
<v Speaker 3>are apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

613
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.040
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

614
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.400
<v Speaker 3>that are high in or that make your body</v>
<v Speaker 3>produce more testosterone.</v>

615
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Here's an interesting thing that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people are finding when they're going</v>

616
00:28:12.421 --> 00:28:16.590
<v Speaker 3>on ketogenic diets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is several people including me,</v>

617
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:21.630
<v Speaker 3>that I have done this where once you</v>
<v Speaker 3>start going on these ketogenic diets and</v>

618
00:28:21.631 --> 00:28:24.180
<v Speaker 3>you get your testosterone tested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is people that are on</v>

619
00:28:24.181 --> 00:28:28.230
<v Speaker 3>testosterone replacement and people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not on testosterone replacement.</v>

620
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.580
<v Speaker 3>I've had three different friends who</v>
<v Speaker 3>have similar results where your test</v>

621
00:28:32.581 --> 00:28:37.581
<v Speaker 3>just gets Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what turns out that fats are one of</v>

622
00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:42.771
<v Speaker 3>the most important things like healthy</v>
<v Speaker 3>fats and essential fatty acids and,</v>

623
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even saturated fats and cholesterol</v>

624
00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:51.840
<v Speaker 3>is one of the most important things for</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body to convert to testosterone,</v>

625
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:53.430
<v Speaker 3>for your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to produce testosterone.</v>

626
00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:55.110
<v Speaker 3>It needs those precursors and needs</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

627
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.570
<v Speaker 3>those important important aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrition.</v>

628
00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Which is really interesting because for</v>
<v Speaker 3>so long people thought that low fat</v>

629
00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:04.910
<v Speaker 3>diets were healthy and low fat was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to go.</v>

630
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.070
<v Speaker 3>Low Fat will make you have more energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll be healthier.</v>

631
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:13.530
<v Speaker 3>But it turns out that's not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>true and it's weird because like what</v>

632
00:29:13.531 --> 00:29:16.890
<v Speaker 3>was like doctrine 20 years ago or 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

633
00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.720
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a wound that's not the case.</v>

634
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading my kid a book Dr Seuss</v>

635
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:25.830
<v Speaker 3>Book and it was a nutrition pyramid at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of the pyramid.</v>

636
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:29.650
<v Speaker 3>Like the most important shit was bread</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was like bread and grains like</v>

637
00:29:29.651 --> 00:29:31.630
<v Speaker 3>that is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

638
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:32.750
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

639
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:34.710
<v Speaker 3>Where's the vegetables?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

640
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.760
<v Speaker 3>Why is that fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is the bottom useless?</v>

641
00:29:38.761 --> 00:29:40.950
<v Speaker 3>Calories like pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so stupid.</v>

642
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly.</v>

643
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.700
<v Speaker 1>People just pound that stuff in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>evenings and wonder why they can't lose</v>

644
00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:46.460
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

645
00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the biggest thing is those late</v>

646
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:51.580
<v Speaker 1>night carbs aren't getting burned up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

647
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:54.400
<v Speaker 1>it gets converted to sugar and it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the insulin,</v>

648
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.470
<v Speaker 1>that's the real issue is a giant issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your body getting this insulin</v>

649
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:04.230
<v Speaker 1>spike and it's just not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not good to have that much God</v>

650
00:30:04.231 --> 00:30:07.000
<v Speaker 1>damn sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist in nature in that form.</v>

651
00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.870
<v Speaker 1>So we have developed these very weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies,</v>

652
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ever since I've been on this</v>

653
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.050
<v Speaker 1>high fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low sugar kick,</v>

654
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.720
<v Speaker 1>I've always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always aware that people are overweight.</v>

655
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it everywhere,</v>

656
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.890
<v Speaker 1>no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's stunning when you really start</v>

657
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:30.110
<v Speaker 1>taking an actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an inventory started looking around</v>

658
00:30:30.111 --> 00:30:33.430
<v Speaker 1>at all these people I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>belly fat and fat,</v>

659
00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:34.420
<v Speaker 1>neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

660
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:38.710
<v Speaker 1>arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat and we're capable of so much.</v>

661
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.900
<v Speaker 1>And then you see people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

662
00:30:40.901 --> 00:30:44.170
<v Speaker 1>and I understand people are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>through things or challenges that have</v>

663
00:30:44.171 --> 00:30:46.240
<v Speaker 1>different challenges in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

664
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:51.520
<v Speaker 1>but our bodies are so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to let them get to that</v>

665
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:53.150
<v Speaker 1>stage for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>

666
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:57.400
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunate because it's so hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>change once you're at that stage,</v>

667
00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:00.520
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard and you feel terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel.</v>

668
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.190
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is me talking about marathon</v>

669
00:31:03.191 --> 00:31:05.530
<v Speaker 1>runners and talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never gotten enormously obese,</v>

670
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:07.790
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine I've gotten fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough for.</v>

671
00:31:07.791 --> 00:31:09.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm disgusted with myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

672
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:10.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

673
00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.770
<v Speaker 1>10 pounds overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

674
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.500
<v Speaker 1>But I think it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

675
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:19.390
<v Speaker 1>they feel like it's too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the idea of running an</v>

676
00:31:19.391 --> 00:31:20.221
<v Speaker 1>ultra marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

677
00:31:20.221 --> 00:31:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>losing 100 pounds.</v>

678
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:24.370
<v Speaker 1>So much work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no different.</v>

679
00:31:24.371 --> 00:31:27.040
<v Speaker 1>So when you run an ultra marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think about you're running 100</v>

680
00:31:27.041 --> 00:31:28.180
<v Speaker 1>miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you break it down.</v>

681
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the same thing with losing</v>

682
00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.480
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't think about,</v>

683
00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:32.770
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to lose 100 pounds.</v>

684
00:31:32.771 --> 00:31:35.220
<v Speaker 1>They think about winning that day right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

685
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.450
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can worry about tomorrow,</v>

686
00:31:37.451 --> 00:31:40.120
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But somebody asked me like,</v>

687
00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:45.121
<v Speaker 1>how do you stay in that a cryogenic</v>
<v Speaker 1>chamber for three minutes at 250 degrees</v>

688
00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:46.720
<v Speaker 1>below zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

689
00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I just count the 63 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

690
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.171
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

691
00:31:50.171 --> 00:31:50.621
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

692
00:31:50.621 --> 00:31:53.020
<v Speaker 1>that's all I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't go one,</v>

693
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.580
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

694
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.580
<v Speaker 1>and I get to 60 and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're done with one one.</v>

695
00:31:57.581 --> 00:32:00.640
<v Speaker 1>And then I do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time I get to the third</v>

696
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:04.170
<v Speaker 1>minute of just I'm shivering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just counting to 60.</v>

697
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not that hard if you play a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

698
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's no different.</v>

699
00:32:08.861 --> 00:32:11.050
<v Speaker 1>So if you wanted to try to do 25 reps in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gym,</v>

700
00:32:11.051 --> 00:32:12.940
<v Speaker 1>you don't do 25,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you five sets of five.</v>

701
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just break that down.</v>

702
00:32:15.131 --> 00:32:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

703
00:32:16.991 --> 00:32:19.510
<v Speaker 1>people are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People break things down differently.</v>

704
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

705
00:32:20.441 --> 00:32:23.350
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about this big foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>$200 raise and I'm thinking well maybe I</v>

706
00:32:23.351 --> 00:32:25.840
<v Speaker 1>should break it into 50 mile races,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

707
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.930
<v Speaker 1>just break it down for fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get it done.</v>

708
00:32:28.931 --> 00:32:32.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's a logical gates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

709
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I do that when I do the Hindu squats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do 210 do squats and the way I do it</v>

710
00:32:37.331 --> 00:32:41.030
<v Speaker 1>as I do them by tens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just just do it and I have a clicker</v>

711
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.360
<v Speaker 1>so I can't cheat because you will</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking forget while you're in the</v>

712
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:45.021
<v Speaker 1>middle of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

713
00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:47.120
<v Speaker 1>what am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 30 and my authority or have to look</v>

714
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:48.740
<v Speaker 1>at the clicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I count.</v>

715
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.290
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end I checked the</v>
<v Speaker 1>clicker to make sure I'm right.</v>

716
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.270
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I break it down in tens.</v>

717
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I just do 10 and then I do 10 more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty and then,</v>

718
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it like that.</v>

719
00:32:58.281 --> 00:33:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I think of it as each one being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

720
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.110
<v Speaker 1>a 10 squat increment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I'm going to get through.</v>

721
00:33:03.111 --> 00:33:07.400
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem so daunting that I do 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>squats and I have 90 or 192 go.</v>

722
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:12.780
<v Speaker 1>I think of it as just each little 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 squat little event that I'm going to</v>

723
00:33:12.781 --> 00:33:13.880
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another 10 squad.</v>

724
00:33:13.881 --> 00:33:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Yvette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's not intense.</v>

725
00:33:15.101 --> 00:33:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Quite event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's nothing.</v>

726
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.350
<v Speaker 1>That's not paying well compared to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

727
00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are also taking a fucking rock and throw</v>

728
00:33:23.931 --> 00:33:27.200
<v Speaker 1>it into a backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Running up the hill.</v>

729
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:30.200
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous to not not running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

730
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're doing that now</v>

731
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:34.770
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

732
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:39.050
<v Speaker 1>a lot of guys are not with your rock the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way you do it,</v>

733
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:44.410
<v Speaker 1>but many guys are taking sandbags and</v>
<v Speaker 1>packing them down just like they would</v>

734
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:45.933
<v Speaker 1>like if they were trying to.</v>

735
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.860
<v Speaker 1>If you had a heavy backpack and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

736
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven miles to go to get back to the</v>

737
00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:52.850
<v Speaker 1>truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing you can do,</v>

738
00:33:52.851 --> 00:33:55.520
<v Speaker 1>but walk those God damn seven miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that heavy backpack,</v>

739
00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.830
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to get out on his own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

740
00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:58.773
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

741
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:03.500
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just hard manual labor,</v>

742
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.020
<v Speaker 1>that's all there is to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you start hunting elk in the</v>

743
00:34:06.021 --> 00:34:09.770
<v Speaker 1>back country or even deer in the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>country or whatever your bear,</v>

744
00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:11.750
<v Speaker 1>you got to get that thing back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truck.</v>

745
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.790
<v Speaker 1>And so some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some guys who can just boost it,</v>

746
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.310
<v Speaker 1>who don't train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can just say,</v>

747
00:34:16.311 --> 00:34:19.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take some time and I'll get it out.</v>

748
00:34:19.461 --> 00:34:22.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a few guys who can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can do that and just one step at a</v>

749
00:34:22.641 --> 00:34:25.280
<v Speaker 1>time type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most guys have to train to be in that</v>

750
00:34:25.281 --> 00:34:25.970
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

751
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:27.050
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most guys.</v>

752
00:34:27.051 --> 00:34:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt.</v>

753
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.843
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

754
00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.490
<v Speaker 1>it's very physically taxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went to,</v>

755
00:34:31.491 --> 00:34:34.100
<v Speaker 1>you and I were in Colorado and we packed</v>
<v Speaker 1>out that bowl.</v>

756
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:34.461
<v Speaker 1>Did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

757
00:34:34.461 --> 00:34:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Did we walk like maybe six tenths of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mile?</v>

758
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

759
00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Mad most three quarters of a mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter mile at most records a mile and</v>

760
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:49.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only had like 100 pounds on and</v>

761
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.030
<v Speaker 1>imagine like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think remy was the one who was talking</v>

762
00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:56.540
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remy Warren of the fabulous a show.</v>

763
00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Apex Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on the podcast talking about how</v>

764
00:34:59.271 --> 00:35:02.840
<v Speaker 1>he had a pack or Moose out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a moose seven miles.</v>

765
00:35:02.841 --> 00:35:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the end he was just broken for</v>

766
00:35:06.231 --> 00:35:08.450
<v Speaker 1>like months because his body was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

767
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.550
<v Speaker 1>All I know it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

768
00:35:10.551 --> 00:35:13.220
<v Speaker 1>when I killed that Moose up in Alaska</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Roy,</v>

769
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:16.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our last time together a moose and that</v>

770
00:35:16.821 --> 00:35:19.670
<v Speaker 1>was up over a big ridge into another</v>
<v Speaker 1>canyon.</v>

771
00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.730
<v Speaker 1>It was four miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't seven like roomies,</v>

772
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:23.930
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

773
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.460
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 600 pounds of meat.</v>

774
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:28.610
<v Speaker 1>So how are you going to get 600 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of meat?</v>

775
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be 100 pounds at a time</v>

776
00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:34.970
<v Speaker 1>and up over the hill and Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a grind.</v>

777
00:35:34.971 --> 00:35:35.804
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

778
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through snow down we walked,</v>

779
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.280
<v Speaker 2>really thought it'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a better route just to go down</v>

780
00:35:41.281 --> 00:35:43.230
<v Speaker 2>the creek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like walk in the creek.</v>

781
00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

782
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:47.550
<v Speaker 2>I came up the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ridge.</v>

783
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.310
<v Speaker 2>He hadn't been in there that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up kind of up the ridge,</v>

784
00:35:50.311 --> 00:35:53.070
<v Speaker 2>staying out of the creek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd always come up the creek because if</v>

785
00:35:53.071 --> 00:35:55.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really the hardest possible way to do</v>

786
00:35:55.891 --> 00:35:57.360
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how he wanted to do it.</v>

787
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:01.830
<v Speaker 2>So our first load out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were walking down the creek,</v>

788
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.330
<v Speaker 2>just feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

789
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.990
<v Speaker 2>if you ever mentioned walking into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>creek with 100 and some pounds on your</v>

790
00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:08.930
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the,</v>

791
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.460
<v Speaker 2>the elders are catching your backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

792
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:15.080
<v Speaker 2>it's exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on the way back in,</v>

793
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:15.933
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

794
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.860
<v Speaker 2>we gotta stay up on that Ridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna,</v>

795
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.440
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love the ridge.</v>

796
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.860
<v Speaker 2>And it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably five times easier.</v>

797
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:23.950
<v Speaker 2>Why would</v>

798
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:26.950
<v Speaker 3>walking in the creek be good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I could think of is if</v>

799
00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:29.290
<v Speaker 3>you were so hot from carrying all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight,</v>

800
00:36:29.291 --> 00:36:30.580
<v Speaker 3>that it would cool you off a little bit,</v>

801
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:34.110
<v Speaker 2>but then you'd be wet now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What his thought was,</v>

802
00:36:34.111 --> 00:36:35.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

803
00:36:35.101 --> 00:36:36.480
<v Speaker 2>there's so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

804
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:39.900
<v Speaker 2>The brush is so thick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're not fighting brush,</v>

805
00:36:39.901 --> 00:36:41.220
<v Speaker 2>if you're in the creek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

806
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.890
<v Speaker 2>usually the creek is pretty open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had cut,</v>

807
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.330
<v Speaker 2>he had cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

808
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.430
<v Speaker 2>some of the brush has grown over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>creek out of the way,</v>

809
00:36:47.431 --> 00:36:50.580
<v Speaker 2>so he sort of had a trail cut in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he came in there that the year</v>

810
00:36:50.581 --> 00:36:52.530
<v Speaker 2>before he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he killed a bull back in there,</v>

811
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:57.540
<v Speaker 2>so we sorta had a trail cut in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the rocky walking in the creek with</v>

812
00:36:57.541 --> 00:36:59.820
<v Speaker 2>the slipping and sliding and everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>else just,</v>

813
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.863
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

814
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:01.980
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

815
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.620
<v Speaker 2>We went on the road and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

816
00:37:04.621 --> 00:37:05.490
<v Speaker 2>this is way better.</v>

817
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:11.380
<v Speaker 3>Reno is brother fucked as backup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So bad that he had a by llamas.</v>

818
00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was carrying on an elk and apparently</v>

819
00:37:14.681 --> 00:37:18.970
<v Speaker 3>he just fucked as backup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just Rinella in his brothers.</v>

820
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.520
<v Speaker 3>They're all savages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all relentless.</v>

821
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.920
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are these fucking hill climbing</v>

822
00:37:23.921 --> 00:37:27.940
<v Speaker 3>psycho goat people that just don't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>tired and they just push each other.</v>

823
00:37:27.941 --> 00:37:31.750
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure growing up they all pushed</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other like knowing Rinella and then</v>

824
00:37:31.751 --> 00:37:34.180
<v Speaker 3>hearing the story about his brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they're basically the same way.</v>

825
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:38.290
<v Speaker 3>And that I think he just said fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>tough enough pussy.</v>

826
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.990
<v Speaker 3>And he kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just his back was just jacked.</v>

827
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:45.370
<v Speaker 3>So then he got llamas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now he takes these llamas in a van.</v>

828
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.250
<v Speaker 3>And when he drives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has these llamas.</v>

829
00:37:48.251 --> 00:37:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Pack the meat out for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

830
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:54.910
<v Speaker 3>we hit me and really had llamas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We bought Llamas for $100 a piece for</v>

831
00:37:54.911 --> 00:37:57.670
<v Speaker 3>the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it like keeping a Llama?</v>

832
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.380
<v Speaker 2>You don't hardly have to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything real.</v>

833
00:38:00.381 --> 00:38:02.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you pay $100 for them,</v>

834
00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.980
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So locked up,</v>

835
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:07.990
<v Speaker 2>falafel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a poor slave lama.</v>

836
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

837
00:38:09.851 --> 00:38:14.110
<v Speaker 2>but they're really hardy animals and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't pack,</v>

838
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't pack like a horse can pack.</v>

839
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:18.780
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they packed 70 pounds and you've</v>

840
00:38:18.781 --> 00:38:20.770
<v Speaker 2>got four of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's 280 pounds.</v>

841
00:38:20.771 --> 00:38:22.260
<v Speaker 2>You're not packing on your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

842
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.250
<v Speaker 2>that adds up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's all we had them.</v>

843
00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:26.170
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would pack,</v>

844
00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.260
<v Speaker 2>even if they didn't pack much meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd pack our camp and we could take</v>

845
00:38:29.261 --> 00:38:32.590
<v Speaker 2>extra food and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'd go in the wilderness with our</v>

846
00:38:32.591 --> 00:38:37.170
<v Speaker 2>four llamas and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was great and they just like hang</v>

847
00:38:37.171 --> 00:38:39.460
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't get cold now and they</v>

848
00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:41.530
<v Speaker 2>don't need water either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sorta like camels.</v>

849
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

850
00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have to worry about water</v>
<v Speaker 2>with horses when you have horses in the</v>

851
00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:47.644
<v Speaker 2>back country.</v>

852
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.820
<v Speaker 2>A wrangling the horses is like a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>different responsibility,</v>

853
00:38:51.821 --> 00:38:54.790
<v Speaker 2>a whole extra responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to make sure they have water,</v>

854
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:55.690
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

855
00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.580
<v Speaker 2>feed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can kind of figure it out in the</v>

856
00:38:57.581 --> 00:38:59.890
<v Speaker 2>high country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have to get water every day,</v>

857
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:03.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can't be gone from camp with,</v>

858
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.610
<v Speaker 2>for an extended periods with llamas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

859
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Remy was on a horse hunt and they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>riding a horse and uh,</v>

860
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:16.120
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys was on the horse and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>horse fell and snapped his leg.</v>

861
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.330
<v Speaker 2>The horse broke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his leg was broken,</v>

862
00:39:18.331 --> 00:39:19.570
<v Speaker 2>his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

863
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.790
<v Speaker 2>the guide just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

864
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:26.680
<v Speaker 2>well everybody back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shoot the horse and so remy was like,</v>

865
00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:28.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this seems like it just kind of like</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know I,</v>

873

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.190
<v Speaker 2>I had horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had An amazing restaurant in Montreal.</v>

875
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Joe Beef twice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two different occasions.</v>

876
00:39:47.891 --> 00:39:50.640
<v Speaker 2>They served as horse one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a.</v>

877
00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:51.493
<v Speaker 2>You were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

878

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't personally,</v>

879
00:39:55.001 --> 00:39:57.820
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't eat what I've seen horses</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead in the back country.</v>

880
00:39:57.850 --> 00:39:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't eat a horse.</v>

881
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if somebody,</v>

882
00:40:01.601 --> 00:40:04.870
<v Speaker 2>if you went to a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sucks super fancy restaurants like Joe</v>

883
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:08.230
<v Speaker 2>beef and they served you a horse</v>
<v Speaker 2>tenderloin,</v>

884
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>could I get that filet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't,</v>

886
00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:14.380
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not really to just try it.</v>

887
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

888
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up around horses.</v>

889
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.250
<v Speaker 2>I love horses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

890
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.140
<v Speaker 2>have written a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember I was hunting in</v>

891
00:40:23.141 --> 00:40:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Australia with Adam Green tree and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>call them Brumby's back there.</v>

892
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.740
<v Speaker 2>So it's just wild horses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were sitting there under a tree</v>

893
00:40:29.741 --> 00:40:33.610
<v Speaker 2>is hot is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean 120 degrees Fahrenheit.</v>

894
00:40:33.611 --> 00:40:36.220
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just sitting there boiling.</v>

895
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Here's this white stallion coming up</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhombi.</v>

896
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:42.880
<v Speaker 2>And Adam's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh that's,</v>

897
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.430
<v Speaker 2>that's a beautiful trophy and a this</v>
<v Speaker 2>whore.</v>

898
00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.500
<v Speaker 2>What a beautiful trophy to shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

899
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 2>they shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>

900
00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:52.780
<v Speaker 2>they're wild horses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was just a trophy.</v>

901
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.210
<v Speaker 2>What a weird way to look at a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

902
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.620
<v Speaker 2>that's why people hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

903
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Is it for food?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

904
00:40:59.531 --> 00:41:00.420
<v Speaker 2>does he eat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The horse</v>

905
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.720
<v Speaker 2>wasn't going to do with the horse I</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot.</v>

906
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:06.750
<v Speaker 2>People are going to be like fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>psycho now.</v>

907
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:09.730
<v Speaker 2>The thing in Australia is all those are</v>
<v Speaker 2>feral animals,</v>

908
00:41:09.731 --> 00:41:11.380
<v Speaker 2>so they need to be killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

909
00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:13.960
<v Speaker 2>So there's no law that says you need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the meat off.</v>

910
00:41:13.961 --> 00:41:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want the animal's dead.</v>

911
00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.310
<v Speaker 2>It was so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too many of them.</v>

912
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll fly over a parks and just wipe</v>

913
00:41:21.641 --> 00:41:24.970
<v Speaker 2>out the buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water buffalo because they just</v>

914
00:41:24.971 --> 00:41:26.560
<v Speaker 2>ruined all the water sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

915
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:28.990
<v Speaker 2>they don't get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's way too many of them.</v>

916
00:41:28.991 --> 00:41:33.800
<v Speaker 2>They were introduced there from Asia and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they need the numbers control.</v>

917
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:36.920
<v Speaker 1>They need them gone basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

918
00:41:36.921 --> 00:41:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean a wild horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

919
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Their um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their sensibilities are so contrary to</v>

920
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:46.340
<v Speaker 1>ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about what hunting is</v>

921
00:41:46.341 --> 00:41:48.050
<v Speaker 1>over here and went hunting is over</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

922
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.900
<v Speaker 1>like for people that are like aghast</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this,</v>

923
00:41:50.901 --> 00:41:52.760
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam is fucking awesome.</v>

924
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I love this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a slight against him.</v>

925
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's amazing.</v>

926
00:41:56.331 --> 00:41:59.780
<v Speaker 1>But his environment is very different</v>
<v Speaker 1>than our environment and this is what's</v>

927
00:41:59.781 --> 00:42:02.540
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia didn't have hardly any</v>

928
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:05.840
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like Kangaroos and wallabies and</v>

929
00:42:05.841 --> 00:42:09.530
<v Speaker 1>some weird shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the animals that they have there</v>

930
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:14.180
<v Speaker 1>have been introduced and they've made</v>
<v Speaker 1>some big mistakes along the way.</v>

931
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the big mistakes was they</v>

932
00:42:16.041 --> 00:42:20.780
<v Speaker 1>brought over foxes and they brought over</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats and uh,</v>

933
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:24.740
<v Speaker 1>this was a huge mistake because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have wild cat everywhere.</v>

934
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere in Australia.</v>

935
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.930
<v Speaker 1>House cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

936
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Regular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like house cats,</v>

937
00:42:28.281 --> 00:42:31.040
<v Speaker 1>except they're wild as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they kill everything.</v>

938
00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:34.940
<v Speaker 1>They decimate ground nesting birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ground nesting birds just go</v>

939
00:42:34.941 --> 00:42:36.070
<v Speaker 1>extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's just,</v>

940
00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.800
<v Speaker 1>they have no chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And cats are fucking murderers.</v>

941
00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:41.630
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this on the podcast</v>

942
00:42:41.631 --> 00:42:42.610
<v Speaker 1>because we did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

943
00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.640
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we read this study that was done</v>

944
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:49.520
<v Speaker 1>recently on how many animals cats killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>per year.</v>

945
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.320
<v Speaker 1>I have two cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love cats.</v>

946
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:52.300
<v Speaker 1>They're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always had,</v>

947
00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.530
<v Speaker 1>I've had cats my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love cats.</v>

948
00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:56.180
<v Speaker 1>So not a slight against cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

949
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:58.580
<v Speaker 1>they killed billions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billions.</v>

950
00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:02.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean Bei Bei every year in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in the US,</v>

951
00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:08.610
<v Speaker 1>the fucking murderers and killed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>rodents and squirrels and birds.</v>

952
00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:13.820
<v Speaker 1>They fucking killed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in Australian hunting magazines,</v>

953
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.670
<v Speaker 1>these guys are holding up cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

954
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Like with smiles on their face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they just shot a coyote or some,</v>

955
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderous of willdabeast thing.</v>

956

958
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.040
<v Speaker 1>some animal that you have to kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

959
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.770
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're holding up a fucking cat.</v>

960
00:43:30.771 --> 00:43:31.700
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

961
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave me one of his magazines while</v>

962
00:43:34.661 --> 00:43:35.750
<v Speaker 1>these Australian Max.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

963
00:43:35.751 --> 00:43:38.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is cat killers incorporated.</v>

964
00:43:38.601 --> 00:43:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Look what the fuck kind of magazines is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

965
00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:42.620
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of guys smiling with pictures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats.</v>

966
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in their world,</v>

967
00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:46.820
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is a necessary thing,</v>

968
00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:50.900
<v Speaker 1>like they have to kill these cats just</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep the population and they're still</v>

969
00:43:50.901 --> 00:43:52.940
<v Speaker 1>barely putting a dent in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

970
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

971
00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.440
<v Speaker 1>the end of my story is here comes this</v>
<v Speaker 1>white stallion,</v>

972
00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:59.900
<v Speaker 1>20 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

973
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.080
<v Speaker 1>And couldn't shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

974
00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

975
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Can't kill a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

976
00:44:06.531 --> 00:44:07.364
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>

977
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

978
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 1>zebras are fairly close to horses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>appearance,</v>

979
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:13.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't.</v>

980
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I've never hunted the zebra either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to Africa multiple times and</v>

981
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:19.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>

982
00:44:19.551 --> 00:44:20.390
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

983
00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

984
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to judge anybody for</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

985
00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rinella had a really good take on this</v>

986
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:29.550
<v Speaker 1>whole cecil the lion thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

987
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that he was saying is</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a hunter</v>

988
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.233
<v Speaker 3>who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cecil,</v>

989
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.640
<v Speaker 3>that's that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dude,</v>

990
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:41.710
<v Speaker 3>he had a brother named Jericho,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his take on it was that as a person</v>

991
00:44:43.351 --> 00:44:45.880
<v Speaker 3>who goes out and takes a life and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

992
00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.870
<v Speaker 3>and does this like in a sort of a public</v>
<v Speaker 3>manner,</v>

993
00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.660
<v Speaker 3>like you have an obligation to consume</v>
<v Speaker 3>that animal.</v>

994
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.310
<v Speaker 3>And so I was saying to him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

995
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:55.410
<v Speaker 3>if you go over to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

996
00:44:55.411 --> 00:44:57.690
<v Speaker 3>well I've never been Africa and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a desire to go to Africa,</v>

997
00:44:57.691 --> 00:45:00.750
<v Speaker 3>but if I did and I shot a line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd eat that line.</v>

998
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would.</v>

999
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.351
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1000
00:45:02.351 --> 00:45:03.490
<v Speaker 3>I'd eat that line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1001
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:05.850
<v Speaker 3>So he won't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he won't shoot anything unless you eat</v>

1002
00:45:05.851 --> 00:45:06.480
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1003
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:11.480
<v Speaker 3>And he's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's actually been on many grizzly</v>

1004
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:12.443
<v Speaker 3>hunts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1005
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:16.320
<v Speaker 3>But he won't haunt coastal grizzlies</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he doesn't want a grizzly that's</v>

1006
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:19.220
<v Speaker 3>been eaten fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants an inland grizzly.</v>

1007
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:22.560
<v Speaker 3>It would be brown bear when it's coastal</v>
<v Speaker 3>and inland.</v>

1008
00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:23.394
<v Speaker 3>What's Grizzly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1009
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.440
<v Speaker 3>So he wants an animal that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1010
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:27.720
<v Speaker 3>most likely eating berries or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he can,</v>

1011
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 3>he can actually eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

1012
00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.650
<v Speaker 3>It's a good way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1013
00:45:31.651 --> 00:45:34.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean he could still eat the coastal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1014
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:38.940
<v Speaker 3>Holy Hell No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've eaten black bear that eat fish and</v>

1015
00:45:38.941 --> 00:45:39.780
<v Speaker 3>they're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1016
00:45:39.781 --> 00:45:41.490
<v Speaker 3>at Prince of Wales Island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1017
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:45.270
<v Speaker 3>those blackberry salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like a grizzly and totally</v>

1018
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.210
<v Speaker 3>different than like an Alberta black</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear.</v>

1019
00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:48.780
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Albert,</v>

1020
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:51.660

<v Speaker 3>their grain fed,</v>

1021
00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.390
<v Speaker 3>it's like a grin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grain Fed beef,</v>

1022
00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:55.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1023
00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.980
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a white tail deer that lives</v>

1024
00:45:58.981 --> 00:45:59.960
<v Speaker 3>near a farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.880
<v Speaker 3>Like if you get white tailed deer that</v>
<v Speaker 3>lived near a farm,</v>

1026
00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:05.970

<v Speaker 3>GMO corn,</v>

1027
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:06.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I down about 90 minutes or so outside of</v>

1038
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the Madison I guess?</v>

1039
00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 90 minutes outside of Madison,</v>

1040
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.290
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just as stunning place.</v>

1041
00:46:40.291 --> 00:46:41.460
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And anyway,</v>

1042
00:46:41.461 --> 00:46:42.310
<v Speaker 3>these deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1043
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.820
<v Speaker 3>they're essentially almost like farm</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

1044
00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:48.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they live in conjunction with people</v>

1045
00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:53.000
<v Speaker 3>like their numbers have never been</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher and one of the reasons is because</v>

1046
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.590
<v Speaker 3>we have these enormous farm areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you,</v>

1047
00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:59.370
<v Speaker 3>if it was like people who are not aware,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the United States,</v>

1048
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.570
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the areas that are known</v>
<v Speaker 3>for being agriculturally strong,</v>

1049
00:47:03.571 --> 00:47:05.670
<v Speaker 3>like Kansas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowa,</v>

1050
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:07.620
<v Speaker 3>those are where all the bucks are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1051
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.200
<v Speaker 3>That's where all the deer are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to those places.</v>

1052
00:47:10.201 --> 00:47:11.640
<v Speaker 3>Great Habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1053
00:47:11.641 --> 00:47:16.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean they live healthy and happy</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of these farms.</v>

1054
00:47:16.141 --> 00:47:19.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're almost farm animals in some</v>

1055
00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:20.880
<v Speaker 3>weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit.</v>

1056
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not fenced in now.</v>

1057
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.590
<v Speaker 3>Not fenced in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a lot of work.</v>

1058
00:47:25.591 --> 00:47:26.550
<v Speaker 3>They're tuned in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1059
00:47:26.551 --> 00:47:28.490
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking ears are going left and</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1060
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.230
<v Speaker 3>They're looking for everybody there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep</v>

1061
00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.010
<v Speaker 1>an eye on predators are notoriously</v>
<v Speaker 1>skittish.</v>

1062
00:47:33.011 --> 00:47:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're tuned in.</v>

1063
00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.970
<v Speaker 1>They are very aware that their desired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1064
00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Someone's trying to jack them to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the really big ones.</v>

1065
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:42.600
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1066
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:45.190
<v Speaker 1>they don't come out in the daytime.</v>

1067
00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:49.400
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times they're only weaknesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rut when it's breeding season.</v>

1068
00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.700
<v Speaker 2>And so then that's when that's a chink</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their armor.</v>

1069
00:47:52.701 --> 00:47:53.840
<v Speaker 2>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to breed,</v>

1070
00:47:53.841 --> 00:47:55.880
<v Speaker 2>they want to find that hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dough that's in the heat.</v>

1071
00:47:55.881 --> 00:47:57.590
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like you in estrus</v>

1072
00:47:57.930 --> 00:47:58.980
<v Speaker 1>and you too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

1073
00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:01.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm judging everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like everybody.</v>

1074
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:05.490
<v Speaker 1>But when you point at somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's four fingers pointing</v>

1075
00:48:05.491 --> 00:48:07.370
<v Speaker 1>back at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not The way I point.</v>

1076
00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.590
<v Speaker 1>I point gangster style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1077
00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:14.680
<v Speaker 1>this says all fire at Jamie and you at</v>
<v Speaker 1>some point I'm pointing to the devil.</v>

1078
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:19.230
<v Speaker 1>My thumb pointing to you with my finger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my other fingers are going to Jamie.</v>

1079
00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Well judge a way that makes you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1080
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.030
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how it works that way.</v>

1081
00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.790
<v Speaker 1>It makes me feel way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got better than people.</v>

1082
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I just like to not look at my own fault</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all and I just,</v>

1083
00:48:31.731 --> 00:48:33.750
<v Speaker 1>it makes me feel super comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1084
00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.080
<v Speaker 1>All I focus on is my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd like to.</v>

1085
00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to try your noble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Noble,</v>

1086
00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:45.100
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a lot of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at these areas in our country that</v>

1087
00:48:47.101 --> 00:48:52.101
<v Speaker 1>are primarily agricultural areas that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have these massive deer populations,</v>

1088
00:48:53.101 --> 00:48:56.940
<v Speaker 1>that is the number one most hunted</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal in North America as white tail</v>

1089
00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:59.670
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most desired animal in America.</v>

1090
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.710
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting how a mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are also spectacular animals,</v>

1091
00:49:04.711 --> 00:49:09.711
<v Speaker 1>but conversely are almost totally wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are mountain animals and nail the</v>

1092
00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:13.360
<v Speaker 1>occasion to go into fields and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1093
00:49:13.361 --> 00:49:15.700
<v Speaker 1>And near farms for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1094
00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.450
<v Speaker 1>finding a lot of these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're just totally,</v>

1095
00:49:18.451 --> 00:49:22.290
<v Speaker 1>completely wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for some people those animals,</v>

1096
00:49:22.291 --> 00:49:26.280
<v Speaker 1>because of the fact they're wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become like a more desirable animal.</v>

1097
00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1098
00:49:28.601 --> 00:49:31.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mountains are,</v>

1099
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:36.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say Romanticize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people look at the mountains</v>

1100
00:49:36.101 --> 00:49:37.210
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like,</v>

1101
00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just being in the mountains is</v>

1102
00:49:39.761 --> 00:49:42.670
<v Speaker 2>powerful in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're hunting an animal that is</v>

1103
00:49:42.671 --> 00:49:44.350
<v Speaker 2>a mountain monarch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

1104
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:46.240
<v Speaker 2>a big bull elk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sheep,</v>

1105
00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:50.900
<v Speaker 2>a very noble animal that lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>exclusively in the mountains and a</v>

1106
00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.250
<v Speaker 2>mountain mule deer in bowhunters know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially,</v>

1107
00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say I was going to say</v>

1108
00:49:56.471 --> 00:49:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Western boners no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but any bowhunter knows that tries to go</v>

1109
00:49:59.351 --> 00:50:03.420
<v Speaker 2>after a mule deer and the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's about as tough of a bow hunters</v>

1110
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:07.210
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean because elk,</v>

1111
00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.480
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've killed most of my bowls.</v>

1112
00:50:09.481 --> 00:50:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Spa and stock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not calling them in and to stock and</v>

1113
00:50:13.091 --> 00:50:18.091
<v Speaker 2>elk is pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just compared to a mule deer.</v>

1114
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Not Easy in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

1115
00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like easy as going to a store and</v>

1116
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:24.430
<v Speaker 2>buying a pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but easy,</v>

1117
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:26.310
<v Speaker 2>easy to get close to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1118
00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:28.190
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to mule deer because</v>

1119
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:30.440
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make noise themselves,</v>

1120
00:50:30.441 --> 00:50:33.740
<v Speaker 1>so they're big animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight hundred pounds kicking rocks,</v>

1121
00:50:33.741 --> 00:50:36.530
<v Speaker 1>break and branches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're making noises so you can get</v>

1122
00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:40.760
<v Speaker 1>away with some noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a mule deer is laying up and it's bad</v>

1123
00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:44.450
<v Speaker 1>on top of a rim rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all it is is laying there at the back</v>

1124
00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:49.210
<v Speaker 1>protected because it's backed up against</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rock wall and it's looking down this,</v>

1125
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.160
<v Speaker 1>the winds coming up so it can smell</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's below him.</v>

1126
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Nothing you can get at them from behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they're with their big ears,</v>

1127
00:50:55.851 --> 00:50:56.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

1128
00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.140
<v Speaker 1>that's why they got the name mule deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're uh,</v>

1129
00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:01.130
<v Speaker 1>they're big ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just listening.</v>

1130
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:05.990
<v Speaker 1>All they're doing is observing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smelling the wind and listening very,</v>

1131
00:51:05.991 --> 00:51:09.140
<v Speaker 1>very hard to get in bell range of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1132
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:10.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1133
00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:14.220
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting how they move to they</v>

1134
00:51:14.221 --> 00:51:15.980
<v Speaker 1>bounce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1135
00:51:15.981 --> 00:51:20.900
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of animals are running deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white tail deer mostly Kinda run.</v>

1136
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:25.010
<v Speaker 1>But mule deer are literally bouncing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the air,</v>

1137
00:51:25.011 --> 00:51:27.620
<v Speaker 1>like some sort of a cartoon rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Point point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1139
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:31.460
<v Speaker 1>I guess I've never even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1140
00:51:31.461 --> 00:51:32.810
<v Speaker 1>obviously I know that because I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1141
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.870
<v Speaker 1>I've spooked plenty of mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1142
00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:41.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's to get up and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a better view of what might have</v>

1143
00:51:41.721 --> 00:51:44.810
<v Speaker 1>spoke to them or what danger might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>there to be high.</v>

1144
00:51:44.811 --> 00:51:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be interesting to find out why</v>

1145
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.040
<v Speaker 1>there's any theories on why they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1146
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.410
<v Speaker 1>They kind of make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they live in fields,</v>

1147
00:51:51.411 --> 00:51:52.580
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1148
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:54.770
<v Speaker 1>there goes one Boeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at them go boing.</v>

1149
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Boing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boing,</v>

1150
00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.650
<v Speaker 1>boing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a weird animal.</v>

1151
00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.770
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking weird is a Weirdo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do that.</v>

1152
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.890
<v Speaker 1>They this very strange look at the size</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his ears.</v>

1153
00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you never seen a mule deer before</v>

1154
00:52:06.411 --> 00:52:06.740
<v Speaker 1>folks?</v>

1155
00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.440
<v Speaker 1>They have ears that are just enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1156
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.800
<v Speaker 1>And he's bouncing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pining towards a good book and they're</v>

1157
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.060
<v Speaker 1>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1158
00:52:14.061 --> 00:52:14.894
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1159
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:19.580
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually so an achilles heel</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a mule deer is those ears if it's</v>

1160
00:52:19.581 --> 00:52:24.581
<v Speaker 1>windy because all the hair in their ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the wind is really blowing and the</v>

1161
00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:28.370
<v Speaker 1>grass where they're bedded is blowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>around or that even the wind is blowing</v>

1162
00:52:28.371 --> 00:52:30.260
<v Speaker 1>the hair on their ears around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't hear.</v>

1163
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:33.430
<v Speaker 1>So if it's windy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get close to them.</v>

1164
00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's dead calm,</v>

1165
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Foxville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be easy.</v>

1166
00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:41.450
<v Speaker 1>But if it's windy that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one way.</v>

1167
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:42.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm bowhunting,</v>

1168
00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:46.600
<v Speaker 1>if I had the wind right and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>gusting,</v>

1169
00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I feel pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good.</v>

1170
00:52:48.831 --> 00:52:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I can get in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is interesting too that these animals</v>

1171
00:52:51.711 --> 00:52:56.711
<v Speaker 1>that are more difficult to get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a one thing that is contrary</v>

1172
00:52:57.021 --> 00:52:59.210
<v Speaker 1>to the way a lot of people think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>

1173
00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:05.120
<v Speaker 1>lease at the highest level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals that are the most difficult</v>

1174
00:53:05.121 --> 00:53:08.090
<v Speaker 1>to get to in the hunts that are most</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult or the most prized,</v>

1175
00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:12.510
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of the reasons why people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you gravitate towards bowhunting</v>

1176
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:16.550
<v Speaker 1>because bowhunting is far more difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>than rifle hunting and then the animals</v>

1177
00:53:16.551 --> 00:53:20.810
<v Speaker 1>that are the most difficult to bowhunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>become the most prized for a lot of</v>

1178
00:53:20.811 --> 00:53:23.930
<v Speaker 1>people like wild desert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bighorn sheep.</v>

1179
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 1>They'll stone sheep,</v>

1180
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.290
<v Speaker 3>dall sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you have to go to these really</v>

1181
00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:31.380
<v Speaker 3>crazy places that are really high up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mountains,</v>

1182
00:53:31.381 --> 00:53:35.700
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to get there in the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>place and then good luck sneaking up on</v>

1183
00:53:35.701 --> 00:53:38.490
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your wide out in the open on this</v>

1184
00:53:38.491 --> 00:53:43.491
<v Speaker 3>gigantic mountain with all this shale</v>
<v Speaker 3>and rocks and I mean those are the</v>

1185
00:53:43.621 --> 00:53:48.621
<v Speaker 3>animals that people prize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In some strange way that these hunters</v>

1186
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:54.030
<v Speaker 3>like the difficulty of the hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tougher it is to camp out there.</v>

1187
00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.260
<v Speaker 3>The difficulty in the conditions that</v>
<v Speaker 3>tough for those conditions are the more</v>

1188
00:53:58.261 --> 00:54:02.100
<v Speaker 3>people sort of like pro like praise</v>
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of experiences.</v>

1189
00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:05.430
<v Speaker 3>It's the challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what it's why we bow hunt.</v>

1190
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:06.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's just a,</v>

1191
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:10.770
<v Speaker 3>that's just a prime example of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest challenge there is,</v>

1192
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:12.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the mountains in those tough</v>

1193
00:54:12.151 --> 00:54:14.580
<v Speaker 3>conditions with a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1194
00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:17.530
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard as it get.</v>

1195
00:54:17.530 --> 00:54:22.530
<v Speaker 3>So we bow hunt because we like challenge</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we put those animals on pedestals</v>

1196
00:54:22.891 --> 00:54:25.020
<v Speaker 3>because they're the ultimate challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1197
00:54:25.021 --> 00:54:27.950
<v Speaker 3>And it's for people that don't hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

1198
00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:30.360
<v Speaker 3>they probably are not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only they're not aware of this,</v>

1199
00:54:30.361 --> 00:54:35.361
<v Speaker 3>but it might not even make that much</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense that this is one of the reasons</v>

1200
00:54:35.431 --> 00:54:37.860
<v Speaker 3>why those animals are like people</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1201
00:54:37.861 --> 00:54:38.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1202
00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.290
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't like how many times do I read</v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

1203
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:41.910
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't take any skill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1204
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:45.570
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is horrible entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most difficult things</v>

1205
00:54:45.571 --> 00:54:49.590
<v Speaker 3>you could do in the world if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to feed yourself with a bow and an</v>

1206
00:54:49.591 --> 00:54:50.590
<v Speaker 3>Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a stick,</v>

1207
00:54:50.591 --> 00:54:52.380
<v Speaker 3>and a string.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to try to feed yourself with</v>

1208
00:54:52.381 --> 00:54:53.100
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1209
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:54.030
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1210
00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.940
<v Speaker 3>The people that say there's no skill</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in bowhunting,</v>

1211
00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:59.010
<v Speaker 3>haven't done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They definitely happen,</v>

1212
00:54:59.011 --> 00:55:00.860
<v Speaker 3>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1213
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:05.960
<v Speaker 3>it's in a can in inconsiderate</v>
<v Speaker 3>convenient way of dismissing something</v>

1214
00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:12.270
<v Speaker 3>that they don't agree with because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their ideology and with a lot of the</v>

1215
00:55:12.271 --> 00:55:13.104
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1216
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:15.690
<v Speaker 3>There are people that eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really weird.</v>

1217
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:20.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're eating meat and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>dismissing someone who's doing one of</v>

1218
00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:22.790
<v Speaker 3>the most difficult things in the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>with meat.</v>

1219
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:23.813
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1220
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.890
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1221
00:55:25.891 --> 00:55:28.020
<v Speaker 3>I know there's people out there who</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't hunt who,</v>

1222
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:29.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>respect animals.</v>

1223
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:31.223
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>

1224
00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:35.880
<v Speaker 3>But those people could never have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same amount of respect.</v>

1225
00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:39.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't think as a hunter who knows what</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes to survive up there,</v>

1226
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:42.060
<v Speaker 3>what it takes to outwit the animal up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1227
00:55:42.061 --> 00:55:44.410
<v Speaker 3>what it takes to be successful and to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get that,</v>

1228
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:47.730
<v Speaker 3>that the meat off the mountain after</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've harvested one.</v>

1229
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.540
<v Speaker 3>The amount of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That whole process builds in a hunter.</v>

1230
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:54.630
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody who hasn't done it could</v>

1231
00:55:54.631 --> 00:55:59.520
<v Speaker 3>appreciate or match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know whether or not they could</v>

1232
00:55:59.521 --> 00:56:04.350
<v Speaker 3>appreciate it as much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think they understand the</v>

1233
00:56:04.351 --> 00:56:04.860
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

1234
00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:09.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they understand the beauty</v>
<v Speaker 3>that some people find in that experience</v>

1235
00:56:09.871 --> 00:56:12.870
<v Speaker 3>because I think in their eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take life,</v>

1236
00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:16.050
<v Speaker 3>this is a negative thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a terrible thing,</v>

1237
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.350
<v Speaker 3>but the way I always kind of look at it</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

1238
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 3>there's a storm going on out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1239
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Close Your door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch game of thrones,</v>

1240
00:56:25.241 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 3>sit in your air conditioned apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drink your soda and like,</v>

1241
00:56:28.121 --> 00:56:29.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is beautiful.</v>

1242
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:31.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why anybody would go out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and kill an animal.</v>

1243
00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:35.950
<v Speaker 3>There's a storm of animals killing</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals out there.</v>

1244
00:56:35.951 --> 00:56:39.460
<v Speaker 3>It's happening right now while we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in this beautiful air</v>

1245
00:56:39.461 --> 00:56:42.160
<v Speaker 3>conditioned studio here in lovely</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woodland Hills,</v>

1246
00:56:42.161 --> 00:56:46.720
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a fucking storm or coyotes or</v>

1247
00:56:46.721 --> 00:56:51.040
<v Speaker 3>kill and deer and bears are killing each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other and that fucking picture that we</v>

1248
00:56:51.041 --> 00:56:54.490
<v Speaker 3>posted that you showed me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I was going to post later today</v>

1249
00:56:54.491 --> 00:56:57.010
<v Speaker 3>of that polar bear carrying around that</v>
<v Speaker 3>cubs head.</v>

1250
00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>

1251
00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 3>Real life that that's going on right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all you're doing is a hunter.</v>

1252
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Is you're choosing to not go the factory</v>
<v Speaker 3>farm route and to make this experience</v>

1253
00:57:09.311 --> 00:57:14.050
<v Speaker 3>of gathering your food a massive</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge and an incredibly rewarding</v>

1254
00:57:14.051 --> 00:57:19.051
<v Speaker 3>experience and you connect yourself to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wild in some really bizarre way that</v>

1255
00:57:21.161 --> 00:57:24.040
<v Speaker 3>I never understood until I started doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1256
00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Once I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I started,</v>

1257
00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:27.760
<v Speaker 3>like I always thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is probably the better way to</v>

1258
00:57:27.761 --> 00:57:28.800
<v Speaker 3>get meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1259
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.210
<v Speaker 3>but once I started doing it this</v>
<v Speaker 3>logically,</v>

1260
00:57:31.211 --> 00:57:32.920
<v Speaker 3>you thought it made sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1261
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:33.783
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1262
00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Speaker 3>but I had no real connection now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you get that spiritual</v>

1263
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:40.870
<v Speaker 3>connection with the animals that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

1264
00:57:40.871 --> 00:57:45.190
<v Speaker 3>the challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own human spirit and what it takes,</v>

1265
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.240
<v Speaker 3>that's where the powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

1266
00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:51.280
<v Speaker 3>how powerful hunting is really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's driven home.</v>

1267
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:52.503
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1268
00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:53.883
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1269
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:57.640
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of psychedelic in a way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people had gotten mad at me because I've</v>

1270
00:57:57.641 --> 00:58:00.810
<v Speaker 3>said this and this is what I mean by</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psychedelic,</v>

1271
00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:01.490
<v Speaker 3>like the.</v>

1272
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:04.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean even hunting an animal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking in his eyes.</v>

1273
00:58:04.541 --> 00:58:08.380
<v Speaker 3>It's psychedelic and some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird way because it's,</v>

1274
00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:11.870
<v Speaker 3>it's paradigm shifting and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sort of,</v>

1275
00:58:11.871 --> 00:58:16.871
<v Speaker 3>it changes your view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It like takes you out of perspective</v>

1276
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:21.760
<v Speaker 3>shifting thing because when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually in this animal's environment,</v>

1277
00:58:21.761 --> 00:58:26.100
<v Speaker 3>you're in this really quiet forest and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1278
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:28.310
<v Speaker 3>you're sneaking up on this animal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1279
00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:30.340
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pursuing it and you're hunting it</v>

1280
00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:33.160
<v Speaker 3>and you lock eyes with this thing and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1281
00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.890
<v Speaker 3>this animal's world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this animal doesn't know anything about</v>

1282
00:58:35.891 --> 00:58:38.140
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't know anything about your</v>

1283
00:58:38.141 --> 00:58:43.141
<v Speaker 3>traditions or your rules or your ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>or your ethics or what you think should</v>

1284
00:58:44.651 --> 00:58:48.370
<v Speaker 3>and shouldn't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This thing is just trying to survive.</v>

1285
00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:51.730
<v Speaker 3>That's it and some very strange way</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it is.</v>

1286
00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:55.480
<v Speaker 3>Not only is it trying to survive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's trying to keep other things from</v>

1287
00:58:55.481 --> 00:58:56.710
<v Speaker 3>doing what it wants to do.</v>

1288
00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:02.050
<v Speaker 3>It wants to stab these other deer with</v>
<v Speaker 3>his antlers so that they can't fuck the</v>

1289
00:59:02.051 --> 00:59:05.830
<v Speaker 3>girls that it wants to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants to pass on its genes in some</v>

1290
00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:08.630
<v Speaker 3>incredibly primitive competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1291
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:12.610
<v Speaker 3>This gene competition that's going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some sort of a way where they're</v>

1292
00:59:12.611 --> 00:59:13.241
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>

1293
00:59:13.241 --> 00:59:16.440
<v Speaker 3>They're not intellectualizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're not thinking about it like,</v>

1294
00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:18.460
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I want to do is pass on my name</v>

1295
00:59:18.461 --> 00:59:22.610
<v Speaker 3>because my boys are going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanes boys and their hands boys never</v>

1296
00:59:22.611 --> 00:59:23.510
<v Speaker 3>quit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1297
00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.820
<v Speaker 3>they are not thinking like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not thinking there.</v>

1298
00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:30.470
<v Speaker 3>No nobleness it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All it is is survival and and breeding.</v>

1299
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:35.530
<v Speaker 3>It's some sort of a nature mathematics</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that's going on and you know this,</v>

1300
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.550
<v Speaker 3>this world is this savage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>primal,</v>

1301
00:59:40.551 --> 00:59:44.570
<v Speaker 3>crazy world and what you're doing as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunter is entering into that world.</v>

1302
00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:48.320
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what people who don't have don't seem to</v>

1303
00:59:48.321 --> 00:59:53.321
<v Speaker 3>understand is that the people that do</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt are responsible directly for the</v>

1304
00:59:54.531 --> 00:59:59.420
<v Speaker 3>population increase of all these animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's very contradictory in a lot of</v>

1305
00:59:59.421 --> 00:59:59.720
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

1306
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.340
<v Speaker 3>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't like the people that,</v>

1307
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.310
<v Speaker 3>that don't like hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but love animals don't understand that</v>

1308
01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:09.480
<v Speaker 3>the numbers are where they are now</v>
<v Speaker 3>directly because of people contributing</v>

1309
01:00:10.071 --> 01:00:15.071
<v Speaker 3>to wildlife preservation to habitat</v>
<v Speaker 3>preservation and to making sure that</v>

1310
01:00:15.081 --> 01:00:19.910
<v Speaker 3>wildlife biologist manage these areas</v>
<v Speaker 3>properly and that's like,</v>

1311
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.850
<v Speaker 3>that's a hard pill to swallow for people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who love animals,</v>

1312
01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:27.851
<v Speaker 3>but the people who are spending the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of money to keep these animals</v>

1313
01:00:28.131 --> 01:00:30.020
<v Speaker 3>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to go kill them and eat them.</v>

1314
01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:32.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1315
01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.080
<v Speaker 3>it's like many things in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't necessarily add up the way</v>

1316
01:00:36.081 --> 01:00:37.910
<v Speaker 3>you'd like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems contradictory,</v>

1317
01:00:37.911 --> 01:00:40.380
<v Speaker 3>but hunters are why there's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1318
01:00:40.381 --> 01:00:42.050
<v Speaker 3>we looked this up last time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More deer,</v>

1319
01:00:42.051 --> 01:00:45.260
<v Speaker 3>elk bear Turkey numbers than there ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been in North America.</v>

1320
01:00:45.261 --> 01:00:46.420
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1321
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.590
<v Speaker 3>I think elk is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elk doesn't occupy as much area as it</v>

1322
01:00:51.591 --> 01:00:54.500
<v Speaker 3>used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was because the assholes who</v>

1323
01:00:54.501 --> 01:00:57.800
<v Speaker 3>were around in the 18 hundreds who came</v>
<v Speaker 3>along first or the 16,</v>

1324
01:00:57.801 --> 01:00:59.210
<v Speaker 3>17 and 18 hundreds.</v>

1325
01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:02.600
<v Speaker 3>They just shot the shit out of him know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were doing it for me to stay</v>

1326
01:01:02.601 --> 01:01:05.170
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it was also,</v>

1327
01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan Flores,</v>

1328
01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:10.460
<v Speaker 3>who was on Ronell's podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't listened to that and the</v>

1329
01:01:10.461 --> 01:01:12.830
<v Speaker 3>mediator podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to this one because it's</v>

1330
01:01:12.831 --> 01:01:15.830
<v Speaker 3>sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a wildlife historian and talks</v>

1331
01:01:15.831 --> 01:01:20.831
<v Speaker 3>about the history of wildlife in North</v>
<v Speaker 3>America and the same guys that killed</v>

1332
01:01:20.901 --> 01:01:24.140
<v Speaker 3>off massive amounts of buffalo in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>country and all of sudden almost made</v>

1333
01:01:24.141 --> 01:01:27.350
<v Speaker 3>them extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did the same thing with pronghorns.</v>

1334
01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.540
<v Speaker 3>They did the same thing with elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

1335
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:34.870
<v Speaker 3>these were guys who came back from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wars and they just had no skills other</v>

1336
01:01:35.061 --> 01:01:38.720
<v Speaker 3>than killing things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was a way to make money for the</v>

1337
01:01:38.721 --> 01:01:41.090
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would go out and just slaughter</v>

1338
01:01:41.091 --> 01:01:44.720
<v Speaker 3>wholesale slaughter of these animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they ran out of Buffalo,</v>

1339
01:01:44.721 --> 01:01:48.170
<v Speaker 3>they turned to the antelope and for hide</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for all these other things.</v>

1340
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:51.110
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings can be this incredibly</v>

1341
01:01:51.111 --> 01:01:53.560
<v Speaker 3>thoughtless consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's,</v>

1342
01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:58.650
<v Speaker 3>that's that connection for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unfairly connected to hunting.</v>

1343
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:01.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some sort of a way.</v>

1344
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:02.180
<v Speaker 3>Well now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1345
01:02:02.181 --> 01:02:02.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hunter's,</v>

1346
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.810
<v Speaker 3>nowadays I think we're doing a good job</v>
<v Speaker 3>at driving home.</v>

1347
01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:07.940
<v Speaker 3>The point hunting is conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1348
01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:09.800
<v Speaker 3>rocky mountain now [inaudible] has</v>
<v Speaker 3>helped,</v>

1349
01:02:09.801 --> 01:02:12.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they coined that term and it's true,</v>

1350
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunters are out there doing,</v>

1351
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.090
<v Speaker 3>doing the work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paying the money.</v>

1352
01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:18.183
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1353
01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.790
<v Speaker 3>we're killing animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's to the benefit of the animals.</v>

1354
01:02:20.791 --> 01:02:21.460
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ben.</v>

1355
01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian has an interesting take on that.</v>

1356
01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.260
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our friend Benno Brian who used to work</v>

1357
01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:28.440
<v Speaker 3>at Peterson's and now I'm worse at Yeti</v>
<v Speaker 3>coolers.</v>

1358
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.330
<v Speaker 3>He says conservation is something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes along.</v>

1359
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:37.920
<v Speaker 3>It's a byproduct of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But really it's about hunting.</v>

1360
01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's,</v>

1361
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.830
<v Speaker 3>that's the honest answer.</v>

1362
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:41.693
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

1363
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:45.030
<v Speaker 3>When I'm out there hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not thinking I needed to be the best</v>

1364
01:02:45.031 --> 01:02:46.120
<v Speaker 3>conservationists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

1365
01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:47.043
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1366
01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm out there to be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that mantra,</v>

1367
01:02:50.881 --> 01:02:53.490
<v Speaker 3>it gets kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an argument mantra.</v>

1368
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:57.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like people that are hunting are</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with so much pressure from</v>

1369
01:02:57.301 --> 01:02:59.340
<v Speaker 3>people that are angry about hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1370
01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.230
<v Speaker 3>That and then this is a different world</v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

1371
01:03:01.231 --> 01:03:05.640
<v Speaker 3>because you were saying when you grew up</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hunters were thought of as like,</v>

1372
01:03:05.641 --> 01:03:07.500
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy provides for his family.</v>

1373
01:03:07.501 --> 01:03:09.540
<v Speaker 3>He goes out and does this incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult thing.</v>

1374
01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:12.450
<v Speaker 3>It's very noble hunters were looked at</v>
<v Speaker 3>with respect.</v>

1375
01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you looked up to a hunter,</v>

1376
01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:15.803
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1377
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.880
<v Speaker 3>if somebody was successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you get your elk this year?</v>

1378
01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:19.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

1379
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:21.210
<v Speaker 3>You know that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a stud.</v>

1380
01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:22.830
<v Speaker 3>It's tough to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tough to do.</v>

1381
01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:23.650
<v Speaker 3>Went out and did it.</v>

1382
01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:27.690
<v Speaker 3>So hunters were put on a pedestal when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>grew up in the town I grew up and where</v>

1383
01:03:27.691 --> 01:03:29.880
<v Speaker 3>I lived and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was something,</v>

1384
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:31.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had pride that you hunted.</v>

1385
01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I think is good about all</v>

1386
01:03:33.721 --> 01:03:36.990
<v Speaker 3>this controversy that when you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this,</v>

1387
01:03:36.991 --> 01:03:40.710
<v Speaker 3>when you were young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no social media and so you</v>

1388
01:03:40.711 --> 01:03:45.180
<v Speaker 3>weren't engaging with people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought in a contrary way that thought</v>

1389
01:03:45.181 --> 01:03:47.940
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're upset by your actions and</v>

1390
01:03:47.941 --> 01:03:50.040
<v Speaker 3>they weren't engaging with you either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1391
01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:52.820
<v Speaker 3>They looked at hunters like elmer Fudd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1392
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:56.850
<v Speaker 3>they looked at him like some guy hunters</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a movie or always this drunk guy was</v>

1393
01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:58.730
<v Speaker 3>out there shooting at anything that</v>
<v Speaker 3>moved.</v>

1394
01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Bad Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bad guy,</v>

1395
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.073
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a bad guy,</v>

1396
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:06.380
<v Speaker 3>and that was their perception and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>perception was based on your environment</v>

1397
01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:10.920
<v Speaker 3>where you're in an area that's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty rural,</v>

1398
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:13.380
<v Speaker 3>a lot of wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of hunters,</v>

1399
01:04:13.381 --> 01:04:16.260
<v Speaker 3>and it's a super normal part of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>

1400
01:04:16.261 --> 01:04:17.094
<v Speaker 3>the culture.</v>

1401
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:21.810
<v Speaker 3>So these people that are urban,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are just conditioned to thinking of</v>

1402
01:04:21.811 --> 01:04:26.520
<v Speaker 3>animals as being pet that you love and</v>
<v Speaker 3>food is being something that gets you</v>

1403
01:04:26.521 --> 01:04:29.700
<v Speaker 3>get from a grocery store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the people that buy meat,</v>

1404
01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.820
<v Speaker 3>they're not involved in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shape or form in the killing of that</v>

1405
01:04:32.821 --> 01:04:34.710
<v Speaker 3>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're completely disconnected from</v>

1406
01:04:34.711 --> 01:04:35.610
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>

1407
01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:39.450
<v Speaker 3>even though there's like this craziness</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on where these animal rights</v>

1408
01:04:39.451 --> 01:04:42.300
<v Speaker 3>people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope your mother gets raped and killed</v>

1409
01:04:42.301 --> 01:04:45.780
<v Speaker 3>and murdered and gutted in front of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>children and all this crazy shit that</v>

1410
01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:49.560
<v Speaker 3>I've seen these angry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>angry people that think of.</v>

1411
01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if there's a lot going on.</v>

1412
01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:57.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they're actually angry</v>
<v Speaker 3>in as much that made it into like a</v>

1413
01:04:57.601 --> 01:05:02.601
<v Speaker 3>logical progression where it makes sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>or if it's just they feel like they have</v>

1414
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:07.500
<v Speaker 3>the right to go after you because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing things and they're really just</v>

1415
01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.760
<v Speaker 3>fucking imbalanced.</v>

1416
01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:13.290
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of that and there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of imbalanced people that do really good</v>

1417
01:05:13.291 --> 01:05:18.291
<v Speaker 3>things because it allows them to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>really aggressive in their negative.</v>

1418
01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:22.150
<v Speaker 3>They're negative behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some people that love to be</v>

1419
01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:26.860
<v Speaker 3>negative and they love to be aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they love to be shitty and insulting</v>

1420
01:05:26.861 --> 01:05:31.861
<v Speaker 3>and and hostile and the way to ensure</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that behavior is not just accepted</v>

1421
01:05:32.651 --> 01:05:37.651
<v Speaker 3>but actually rewarded is to be negative</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hostile and even violent for a good</v>

1422
01:05:38.411 --> 01:05:39.160
<v Speaker 3>cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1423
01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they're masking their really</v>

1424
01:05:41.621 --> 01:05:43.850
<v Speaker 3>psychotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up behavior.</v>

1425
01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.520
<v Speaker 3>It looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things like people's like</v>

1426
01:05:45.521 --> 01:05:48.040
<v Speaker 3>being a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being an animal rights person or being a</v>

1427
01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:51.820
<v Speaker 3>Vegan is about compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except when you're talking to people</v>

1428
01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:55.720
<v Speaker 3>that don't agree with you and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to get fucking super</v>

1429
01:05:55.721 --> 01:05:59.200
<v Speaker 3>hostile and super negative and violent</v>
<v Speaker 3>and self righteous.</v>

1430
01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:03.340
<v Speaker 3>Call us murderers and say we deserve to</v>
<v Speaker 3>die and they would like to kill us.</v>

1431
01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:06.880
<v Speaker 3>So they're tolerant until you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a cause.</v>

1432
01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:11.970
<v Speaker 3>A cause that you know is you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually think to justify and you have</v>

1433
01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:14.240
<v Speaker 3>to actually look at the big picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1434
01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.820
<v Speaker 3>but when it's easy and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1435
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 3>you hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a murderer,</v>

1436
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:18.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish you were dead.</v>

1437
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.440
<v Speaker 3>That's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1438
01:06:20.441 --> 01:06:20.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1439
01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.690
<v Speaker 3>it's in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand it,</v>

1440
01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:25.660
<v Speaker 3>I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand where they're coming from</v>

1441
01:06:25.661 --> 01:06:28.300
<v Speaker 3>and I understand their perspective of</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who actually does love animals.</v>

1442
01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:32.110
<v Speaker 3>I understand that this contradiction is</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to deal with and that's</v>

1443
01:06:32.111 --> 01:06:36.460
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 3>important about this new age of</v>

1444
01:06:36.461 --> 01:06:39.970
<v Speaker 3>interaction is that some people are kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of getting the understanding.</v>

1445
01:06:39.971 --> 01:06:41.320
<v Speaker 3>They're getting the message like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1446
01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:45.490
<v Speaker 3>I thought that this thing was about</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people that hated animals that</v>

1447
01:06:45.491 --> 01:06:50.140
<v Speaker 3>went out and shot him and killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now I'm seeing that this thing also</v>

1448
01:06:50.141 --> 01:06:54.850
<v Speaker 3>has a lot of different layers to it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a broad range of these people</v>

1449
01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:00.360
<v Speaker 3>and the noble ones are actually doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just a service to the wildlife.</v>

1450
01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:06.840
<v Speaker 3>They're stewards of the wildlife and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stewards of the land and there are also</v>

1451
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.720
<v Speaker 3>up there getting their food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're getting the healthiest food that</v>

1452
01:07:10.721 --> 01:07:15.721
<v Speaker 3>a person can eat right from the wild and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this idea that you can somehow or</v>

1453
01:07:17.741 --> 01:07:21.400
<v Speaker 3>another have no harm and do no harm to</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

1454
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Well that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do no harm.</v>

1455
01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:24.461
<v Speaker 3>And we said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1456
01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:27.430
<v Speaker 3>you could do less harm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depends on what you think less harm</v>

1457
01:07:27.431 --> 01:07:30.040
<v Speaker 3>means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you're talking about bugs,</v>

1458
01:07:30.490 --> 01:07:33.070
<v Speaker 3>are bugs life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're talking about rodents,</v>

1459
01:07:33.071 --> 01:07:35.140
<v Speaker 3>if you're talking about things that get</v>
<v Speaker 3>chewed up when they,</v>

1460
01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:37.190
<v Speaker 3>when they processed grain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1461
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.460
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Animals are dying and if you,</v>

1462
01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.260
<v Speaker 3>and if you procreate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

1463
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:43.710
<v Speaker 3>that's a fucking ball of wax right</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1464
01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:46.510
<v Speaker 3>That's a bag of worms or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the expression?</v>

1465
01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Bag of worms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a bag of wax.</v>

1466
01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.340
<v Speaker 3>I can wax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you procreate,</v>

1467
01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:56.520
<v Speaker 3>boy your your you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are creating a beautiful little baby</v>

1468
01:07:56.830 --> 01:08:01.780
<v Speaker 3>human being that is going to consume and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna Cause waste.</v>

1469
01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:05.560
<v Speaker 3>It's going to burn fossil fuels into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere.</v>

1470
01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:10.360
<v Speaker 3>It's going to promote global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to have plastic that most</v>

1471
01:08:10.361 --> 01:08:13.600
<v Speaker 3>likely will wash up into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a consumer of all these</v>

1472
01:08:13.601 --> 01:08:18.601
<v Speaker 3>things and there's no way around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you love people like I do,</v>

1473
01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I've hugged and love people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are destroyers.</v>

1474
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dislike.</v>

1475
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like bears eat cubs.</v>

1476
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:29.300
<v Speaker 3>People make a certain amount of waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1477
01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:33.410
<v Speaker 3>and hopefully we can figure out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>balance that out as people get more and</v>

1478
01:08:33.411 --> 01:08:38.411
<v Speaker 3>more complex in their ability to utilize</v>
<v Speaker 3>recycled materials and maybe even</v>

1479
01:08:39.861 --> 01:08:42.830
<v Speaker 3>possibly turn some of the waste that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>pump out into the air.</v>

1480
01:08:42.831 --> 01:08:47.690
<v Speaker 3>There was discussion about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about extracting pollution from the air</v>

1481
01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:51.110
<v Speaker 3>and using it as fuel and there'd be some</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to do that.</v>

1482
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:52.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that scientists are actually</v>

1483
01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:57.410
<v Speaker 3>trying to come up with feasible methods</v>
<v Speaker 3>of taking places that are just like</v>

1484
01:08:57.411 --> 01:09:02.200
<v Speaker 3>really polluted and actually using that</v>
<v Speaker 3>pollutants are those pollutants and</v>

1485
01:09:02.201 --> 01:09:04.640
<v Speaker 3>turning it into some sort of a product</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can use.</v>

1486
01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.660
<v Speaker 3>They're smarter than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that me too,</v>

1487
01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:08.290
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1488
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:09.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hopeful.</v>

1489
01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:14.920
<v Speaker 3>But what I'm saying is that we're all in</v>
<v Speaker 3>some way responsible for some sort of an</v>

1490
01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:21.791
<v Speaker 3>impact on the world that we live in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like dog shit on the ground and you</v>

1491
01:09:22.821 --> 01:09:24.920
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cats kill every fucking thing they get a</v>

1492
01:09:24.921 --> 01:09:26.510
<v Speaker 3>chance to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's their design.</v>

1493
01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:27.650
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're supposed to do.</v>

1494
01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:29.920
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing more friendly to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunter.</v>

1495
01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:31.200
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1496
01:09:31.230 --> 01:09:32.960
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1497
01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.350
<v Speaker 2>helping the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting out there,</v>

1498
01:09:36.790 --> 01:09:39.630
<v Speaker 2>killing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>processing it,</v>

1499
01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.050
<v Speaker 2>bringing it home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1500
01:09:41.530 --> 01:09:44.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about as good as it gets as far</v>

1501
01:09:44.231 --> 01:09:45.850
<v Speaker 2>as ECO friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1502
01:09:45.851 --> 01:09:46.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1503
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.290
<v Speaker 2>I think we're getting that message out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there on the positive attributes of</v>

1504
01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:49.901
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1505
01:09:49.901 --> 01:09:51.610
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about this a number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

1506
01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:53.800
<v Speaker 2>You've talked about it with other guests</v>
<v Speaker 2>number times,</v>

1507
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.821
<v Speaker 2>and I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1508
01:09:54.821 --> 01:09:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I still see a lot of hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anger,</v>

1509
01:09:57.430 --> 01:10:00.730
<v Speaker 2>misunder not misunderstanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't want to understand.</v>

1510
01:10:00.731 --> 01:10:05.110
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the other side I get messages</v>

1511
01:10:05.111 --> 01:10:09.040
<v Speaker 2>from a lot of people who are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never thought about hunting now way</v>

1512
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in providing for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be self sufficient.</v>

1513
01:10:13.211 --> 01:10:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting a bow.</v>

1514
01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:16.090
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1515
01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:18.660
<v Speaker 2>we're doing good things also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know we,</v>

1516
01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:21.130
<v Speaker 2>we talk about the negative lot and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus on that.</v>

1517
01:10:21.131 --> 01:10:21.964
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1518
01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:25.690
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at my social media stuff,</v>

1519
01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.760
<v Speaker 2>I do notice the negatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably too much so I mean I know</v>

1520
01:10:30.761 --> 01:10:32.080
<v Speaker 2>we talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

1521
01:10:32.081 --> 01:10:33.610
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of positive out there too,</v>

1522
01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:35.920
<v Speaker 3>is way more positive than there is</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative now,</v>

1523
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:40.240
<v Speaker 3>but it's all in what you focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you decided to focus on the negative,</v>

1524
01:10:40.241 --> 01:10:41.480
<v Speaker 3>there'd be way more negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1525
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:43.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can definitely find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1526
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Just put Hashtag Vegan on all your posts</v>
<v Speaker 3>and watch what happens.</v>

1527
01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:50.350
<v Speaker 3>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only did it once.</v>

1528
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:52.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get so upset.</v>

1529
01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:53.980
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was over a joke.</v>

1530
01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:55.270
<v Speaker 3>It was a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

1531
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:59.290
<v Speaker 3>it had meat in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't handle jokes now.</v>

1532
01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.270
<v Speaker 3>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1533
01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:03.860
<v Speaker 3>just these conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1534
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.850
<v Speaker 3>they're important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also important for people that are</v>

1535
01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:11.050
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in chanted by maybe a more</v>

1536
01:11:11.051 --> 01:11:15.930
<v Speaker 3>radical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a animal activist perspective and you</v>

1537
01:11:15.931 --> 01:11:17.100
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to make sense,</v>

1538
01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:22.140
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes the that needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>balanced out and you need to consider</v>

1539
01:11:22.141 --> 01:11:25.890
<v Speaker 3>both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the hunting side is not</v>

1540
01:11:25.891 --> 01:11:28.470
<v Speaker 3>represented enough in an intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1541
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:31.740
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it balances out some of the more radical</v>

1542
01:11:31.741 --> 01:11:36.741
<v Speaker 3>and also proselytizing like they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to convert people into their</v>

1543
01:11:37.021 --> 01:11:40.530
<v Speaker 3>world in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of people that are animal</v>

1544
01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:43.260
<v Speaker 3>rights people were Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are really actively trying to get</v>

1545
01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:47.970
<v Speaker 3>people to do what they do and get super</v>
<v Speaker 3>upset when people find it unhealthy or</v>

1546
01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:49.450
<v Speaker 3>no longer do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1547
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:54.790
<v Speaker 3>It meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>95 percent of the world consumes meat 95</v>

1548
01:11:54.901 --> 01:11:57.450
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when people go back and that used to</v>

1549
01:11:57.451 --> 01:11:58.920
<v Speaker 3>be Vegan and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just fucking,</v>

1550
01:11:58.921 --> 01:12:00.720
<v Speaker 3>my whole body's falling apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my hair's falling out,</v>

1551
01:12:00.721 --> 01:12:02.640
<v Speaker 3>my skin is to dry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have no energy,</v>

1552
01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:04.770
<v Speaker 3>and this is a really common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say,</v>

1553
01:12:04.771 --> 01:12:05.700
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because you're doing it wrong.</v>

1554
01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:08.720
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of aspects like you.</v>

1555
01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:10.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you should or shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>

1556
01:12:10.351 --> 01:12:14.310
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of aspects that if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to an actual scientist,</v>

1557
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:18.300
<v Speaker 3>real nutritionist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are experts in human biology</v>

1558
01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:22.200
<v Speaker 3>and the direct mechanisms of absorbing</v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrients,</v>

1559
01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:25.710
<v Speaker 3>there's some real issues with plant</v>
<v Speaker 3>versions of many different things</v>

1560
01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:29.580
<v Speaker 3>including vitamin B.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twelve have a bunch of different fatty</v>

1561
01:12:29.581 --> 01:12:34.110
<v Speaker 3>acids that although they are active in</v>
<v Speaker 3>some plants and seeds and oils which are</v>

1562
01:12:34.111 --> 01:12:37.430
<v Speaker 3>probably good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're actually not nearly as bio</v>

1563
01:12:37.431 --> 01:12:40.980
<v Speaker 3>available as fatty fish and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dah Da.</v>

1564
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:41.960
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1565
01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.640
<v Speaker 3>a lot of different essential fatty</v>
<v Speaker 3>acids,</v>

1566
01:12:44.641 --> 01:12:46.770
<v Speaker 3>Omega threes and sixes and all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>

1567
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:51.000
<v Speaker 3>They're more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more biologically available to human</v>

1568
01:12:51.001 --> 01:12:54.360
<v Speaker 3>beings in animal form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is just science.</v>

1569
01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.550
<v Speaker 3>This is getting a forget about the idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you shouldn't do it because what's</v>

1570
01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:01.200
<v Speaker 3>talk about like what is good for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>human body itself,</v>

1571
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:04.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking hard to get the same stuff</v>

1572
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:07.320
<v Speaker 3>from plants and if it's important to you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you want to do it,</v>

1573
01:13:07.321 --> 01:13:08.460
<v Speaker 3>you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

1574
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.380
<v Speaker 3>But my driver yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1575
01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.220
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he switched into was a Vegan.</v>

1576
01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:18.780
<v Speaker 3>He's a Vegan now and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he was telling me that actually since</v>

1577
01:13:18.781 --> 01:13:23.781
<v Speaker 3>he started with his veganism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he eats way less healthy because while</v>

1578
01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:28.580
<v Speaker 3>he's not eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's eating potato chips and he's eating</v>

1579
01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:32.220
<v Speaker 3>all these carbs and all of these empty</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbs and there's just like,</v>

1580
01:13:32.221 --> 01:13:33.870
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not eating me,</v>

1581
01:13:33.871 --> 01:13:37.800
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel terrible and I'm eating awful</v>

1582
01:13:37.801 --> 01:13:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Doritos.</v>

1583
01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:42.720
<v Speaker 3>There's no meat and Doritos but not that</v>
<v Speaker 3>great for you as well.</v>

1584
01:13:42.721 --> 01:13:45.600
<v Speaker 3>Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was on our podcast recently,</v>

1585
01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:50.630
<v Speaker 3>he recently can be converted to being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegan as well because of the honest</v>

1586
01:13:50.821 --> 01:13:53.820
<v Speaker 3>concerns with factory farming and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>along those lines.</v>

1587
01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.310
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his blood lip,</v>

1588
01:13:55.311 --> 01:13:56.700
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all fucked up and he's like,</v>

1589
01:13:56.701 --> 01:13:58.740
<v Speaker 3>I gotta figure this out because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1590
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.900
<v Speaker 3>you're eating carbs all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body just,</v>

1591
01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.780
<v Speaker 3>your insulin spikes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your blood sugar level spikes.</v>

1592
01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just not necessarily healthy unless</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1593
01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:10.830
<v Speaker 3>you have to approach it the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to eat a lot of like healthy</v>

1594
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:14.230
<v Speaker 3>things like almond butters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really important nuts,</v>

1595
01:14:14.231 --> 01:14:15.610
<v Speaker 3>macadamia nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta,</v>

1596
01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:20.260
<v Speaker 3>you gotta find a way to get oils and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fats from your foods.</v>

1597
01:14:20.261 --> 01:14:23.110
<v Speaker 3>And also the way that affects brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>function,</v>

1598
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:25.180
<v Speaker 3>it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really important that you have a</v>

1599
01:14:25.181 --> 01:14:29.350
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of Omega is to really to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have your fucking brain conduct</v>

1600
01:14:29.351 --> 01:14:30.160
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

1601
01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:32.560
<v Speaker 3>It's like having good spark plugs in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fucking car.</v>

1602
01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:35.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ate a lot of meat and I feel pretty</v>

1603
01:14:35.201 --> 01:14:38.050
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

1604
01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.750
<v Speaker 3>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a debate where,</v>

1605
01:14:40.751 --> 01:14:41.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

1606
01:14:41.261 --> 01:14:43.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who is a Vegan does less harm.</v>

1607
01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:49.090
<v Speaker 3>And that there's definitely an argument</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>

1608
01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:53.740
<v Speaker 3>If you accept a hierarchy of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is where it gets tricky because</v>

1609
01:14:53.741 --> 01:14:58.030
<v Speaker 3>what they're saying is that you should</v>
<v Speaker 3>not think that a human beings life is</v>

1610
01:14:58.031 --> 01:15:01.270
<v Speaker 3>more important that an animal's life</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's speciesism.</v>

1611
01:15:01.710 --> 01:15:02.590
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard that?</v>

1612
01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:03.640
<v Speaker 3>This is new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1613
01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:07.030
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a Kat von d put up a little thing</v>

1614
01:15:07.031 --> 01:15:12.031
<v Speaker 3>on her instagram and it had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had like a man at the top of the food</v>

1615
01:15:14.231 --> 01:15:18.310
<v Speaker 3>chain basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was labeled as ego and then it</v>

1616
01:15:18.311 --> 01:15:21.740
<v Speaker 3>had man mixed in with all the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals and that was ego.</v>

1617
01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:23.680
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1618
01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:27.040
<v Speaker 3>ECO is man mixed in with all the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals if you eat them,</v>

1619
01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:30.100
<v Speaker 3>if you consume them the way they consume</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1620
01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:33.550
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's egotistical,</v>

1621
01:15:33.551 --> 01:15:35.530
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying man is a top of the food</v>
<v Speaker 3>chain.</v>

1622
01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:38.100
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Duh.</v>

1623
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:39.370
<v Speaker 3>And I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1624
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:41.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm not hiding that fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel bad about that.</v>

1625
01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm a big fan of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also a Kat von d needs to consider.</v>

1626
01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:50.791
<v Speaker 3>And I love cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her tattoos are most likely not Vegan</v>

1627
01:15:50.890 --> 01:15:52.730
<v Speaker 3>inc is made with animal products.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1628
01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:53.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1629
01:15:53.231 --> 01:15:57.520
<v Speaker 3>that's a part of tattoo ink and they do</v>
<v Speaker 3>have some Vegan inks now,</v>

1630
01:15:57.521 --> 01:16:01.330
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that all those tattoos that she</v>

1631
01:16:01.331 --> 01:16:04.290
<v Speaker 3>has are all Vegan dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

1632
01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds rough.</v>

1633
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:08.080
<v Speaker 3>What's better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was Vegan Inc is good.</v>

1634
01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.270
<v Speaker 3>Wonder if it's a one or if it's less</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1635
01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:12.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's like Vegan chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>

1636
01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:14.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start protocols.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taste.</v>

1637
01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1638
01:16:16.210 --> 01:16:19.630
<v Speaker 3>but my point is the accepting the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy of life.</v>

1639
01:16:19.631 --> 01:16:24.631
<v Speaker 3>Because if you buy commercial grain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're directly responsible for an</v>

1640
01:16:24.851 --> 01:16:29.851
<v Speaker 3>industry that kills a lot of beings now</v>
<v Speaker 3>are the pesticides.</v>

1641
01:16:30.491 --> 01:16:33.910
<v Speaker 3>Unless you buy everything organic from</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking handpick farm when you</v>

1642
01:16:33.911 --> 01:16:38.740
<v Speaker 3>absolutely know that no one had any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely no pesticides were done,</v>

1643
01:16:38.741 --> 01:16:42.190
<v Speaker 3>no one had anything that they put into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground that's dangerous to any of</v>

1644
01:16:42.191 --> 01:16:44.740
<v Speaker 3>the life that's not likely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1645
01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:49.770
<v Speaker 3>keep the likely case is that if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>buying pasta or if you're buying rice or</v>

1646
01:16:50.081 --> 01:16:54.280
<v Speaker 3>if you're buying any of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're buying these things from some</v>

1647
01:16:54.281 --> 01:16:58.420
<v Speaker 3>sort of a farm that displaces wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kills,</v>

1648
01:16:58.510 --> 01:17:02.140
<v Speaker 3>massive amounts of rodents and bugs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different things in.</v>

1649
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:06.370
<v Speaker 3>Is a bug worth as much as the life of</v>
<v Speaker 3>NLC.</v>

1650
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:09.160
<v Speaker 3>We need to make this discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an important.</v>

1651
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:14.510
<v Speaker 3>Is a mouse as worth as much as a white</v>
<v Speaker 3>tail deer,</v>

1652
01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:16.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it is,</v>

1653
01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:21.100
<v Speaker 3>but I know that millions of rodents are</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed in this country every year with</v>

1654
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:24.990
<v Speaker 3>green combines and with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>illustration where all the animals are</v>

1655
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.140
<v Speaker 3>mixed in with the man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess everybody's equal,</v>

1656
01:17:27.141 --> 01:17:30.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why would it be okay to have wheat</v>

1657
01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:33.080
<v Speaker 3>harvested?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buzzards flying all around that field</v>

1658
01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:36.140
<v Speaker 3>because of all the carnage down below</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're scavengers,</v>

1659
01:17:36.141 --> 01:17:39.470
<v Speaker 3>so all the the road and saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rabbits,</v>

1660
01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:43.130
<v Speaker 3>all the pheasants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even white tail fawn,</v>

1661
01:17:43.131 --> 01:17:45.980
<v Speaker 3>maybe all the animals that are killed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're.</v>

1662
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:48.950
<v Speaker 3>They're coming down to eat those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the harvest of that wheat bread</v>

1663
01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.640
<v Speaker 3>for that week or the week for the bread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these animals died.</v>

1664
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if everything's equal,</v>

1665
01:17:54.291 --> 01:17:55.220
<v Speaker 3>why is that okay?</v>

1666
01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:58.670
<v Speaker 3>But hunting isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

1667
01:17:58.671 --> 01:17:59.540
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1668
01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:04.590
<v Speaker 3>it's a convenient way of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and it's also like bug spray.</v>

1669
01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.910
<v Speaker 3>I used to live near an Ashram in boulder</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1670
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:11.590
<v Speaker 3>the fucking lady who ran the restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 3>was poisoning nance.</v>

1671
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:13.123
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1672
01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.580
<v Speaker 3>what'd you do when she was using ant</v>
<v Speaker 3>poison?</v>

1673
01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:17.331
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1674
01:18:17.331 --> 01:18:19.700
<v Speaker 3>we do what we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes when we have ants would go,</v>

1675
01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:22.930
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a vegetarian.</v>

1676
01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:27.980
<v Speaker 3>She's a Vegan and you don't believe in</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing life unless these conti bugs at</v>

1677
01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:33.280
<v Speaker 3>that tried to invade your camp and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kill them in mass with toxic</v>

1678
01:18:33.351 --> 01:18:37.010
<v Speaker 3>chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You spray from the sky in these</v>

1679
01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.030
<v Speaker 3>canisters of death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1680
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:45.070
<v Speaker 3>what a weird sort of a game you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing in your head about life and</v>

1681
01:18:45.411 --> 01:18:50.411
<v Speaker 3>death is an insect's life worth less</v>
<v Speaker 3>than a mammal's life.</v>

1682
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is that?</v>

1683
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because an insect is not as much aware.</v>

1684
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.690
<v Speaker 3>You ever tried to Swat a fly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1685
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:57.260
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason why they get the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the way.</v>

1686
01:18:57.261 --> 01:18:58.460
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know.</v>

1687
01:18:58.461 --> 01:18:59.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1688
01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:03.020
<v Speaker 3>but is an insect's life worth less than</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mouse?</v>

1689
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:04.850
<v Speaker 3>Some people would say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1690
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:06.200
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1691
01:19:06.201 --> 01:19:08.660
<v Speaker 3>a mouse is a had as emotions and see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1692
01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:09.710
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

1693
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:13.190
<v Speaker 3>well then we're accepting a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1694
01:19:13.191 --> 01:19:15.470
<v Speaker 3>these animals that can't communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not as good as people.</v>

1695
01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.210
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to eat them because it</v>

1696
01:19:17.211 --> 01:19:18.590
<v Speaker 3>makes you healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1697
01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we accept in this.</v>

1698
01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:21.260
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not.</v>

1699
01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:23.150
<v Speaker 3>Well then you got to stop eating grain</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1700
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:24.230
<v Speaker 3>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1701
01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:26.840
<v Speaker 3>you're a part of wholesale slaughter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>

1702
01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:29.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it goes back to,</v>

1703
01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of hypocritical people</v>

1704
01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:32.930
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're prostitize.</v>

1705
01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:35.630
<v Speaker 3>This is where it gets really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching this guy give this</v>

1706
01:19:35.631 --> 01:19:39.260
<v Speaker 3>argument about how human beings are not</v>
<v Speaker 3>designed to eat meat.</v>

1707
01:19:39.261 --> 01:19:43.160
<v Speaker 3>That's why we can't kill an animal with</v>
<v Speaker 3>our hands and our teeth and we have to</v>

1708
01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:46.370
<v Speaker 3>cook it in order to process it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way our body consumes</v>

1709
01:19:46.371 --> 01:19:47.480
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1710
01:19:47.481 --> 01:19:48.650
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck face.</v>

1711
01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:50.440
<v Speaker 3>Try eating wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1712
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:52.700
<v Speaker 3>try pulling rice out of the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating that.</v>

1713
01:19:52.730 --> 01:19:54.270
<v Speaker 3>We process everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1714
01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.720
<v Speaker 3>We process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We process rice,</v>

1715
01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:01.310
<v Speaker 3>we process many grains and beans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We process a lot of shit because we're</v>

1716
01:20:01.311 --> 01:20:04.310
<v Speaker 3>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We figured out how to use tools a long</v>

1717
01:20:04.311 --> 01:20:05.121
<v Speaker 3>time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1718
01:20:05.121 --> 01:20:08.310
<v Speaker 3>we figured out how to burn things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes it compatible and your body</v>

1719
01:20:08.311 --> 01:20:11.100
<v Speaker 3>adjusted to the fact that you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>cooking off the bacteria and these</v>

1720
01:20:11.101 --> 01:20:13.410
<v Speaker 3>things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your gut flora changes.</v>

1721
01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:15.420
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole process going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1722
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:20.040
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole evolutionary process</v>
<v Speaker 3>involving tools and fire and that's why</v>

1723
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:23.340
<v Speaker 3>we have cities and that's why you have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking youtube account where you can</v>

1724
01:20:23.341 --> 01:20:25.080
<v Speaker 3>make these ridiculous claims in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first place.</v>

1725
01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:29.400
<v Speaker 3>It's all designed by people overcoming</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wild environment because I don't</v>

1726
01:20:29.401 --> 01:20:31.350
<v Speaker 3>know if you checked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're fleshy.</v>

1727
01:20:31.351 --> 01:20:34.530
<v Speaker 3>Little water balloons of blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we are.</v>

1728
01:20:34.531 --> 01:20:36.210
<v Speaker 3>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're really vulnerable.</v>

1729
01:20:36.211 --> 01:20:40.500
<v Speaker 3>Without all these tools and all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>houses and all these fucking people that</v>

1730
01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:44.370
<v Speaker 3>figured out fire and metal and all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit long before you were alive.</v>

1731
01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:48.600
<v Speaker 3>The reason why you're alive today is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because really ingenious,</v>

1732
01:20:48.601 --> 01:20:51.750
<v Speaker 3>inventive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>industrious people figured out how to</v>

1733
01:20:51.751 --> 01:20:56.751
<v Speaker 3>survive in a world where we could shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're weak and vulnerable and the</v>

1734
01:20:56.910 --> 01:21:00.660
<v Speaker 3>animals come in and just her jack and</v>
<v Speaker 3>things left and right,</v>

1735
01:21:00.661 --> 01:21:03.000
<v Speaker 3>and we're out there with their little</v>
<v Speaker 3>baby in this world.</v>

1736
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear about the fucking 15 year</v>
<v Speaker 3>old kid?</v>

1737
01:21:04.741 --> 01:21:08.670
<v Speaker 3>They get pulled out of a fucking tent by</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Hyena by his face.</v>

1738
01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:12.420
<v Speaker 3>He got yanked out of a fucking 10 by his</v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

1739
01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go on a happy camping</v>

1740
01:21:14.311 --> 01:21:17.340
<v Speaker 3>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This kid is just hanging out in the</v>

1741
01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:20.550
<v Speaker 3>natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love animals because they love you</v>

1742
01:21:20.551 --> 01:21:21.450
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Fuck?</v>

1743
01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.000
<v Speaker 3>They love to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at this boy.</v>

1744
01:21:24.001 --> 01:21:27.900
<v Speaker 3>15 had his face chewed by a Hyena as he</v>
<v Speaker 3>slept in a tent next to it.</v>

1745
01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Carrots in the Kruger National Park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1746
01:21:31.451 --> 01:21:34.030
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real deal that his bones were</v>

1747
01:21:34.031 --> 01:21:36.640
<v Speaker 1>crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a packet of crisps.</v>

1748
01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1749
01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1750
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Hyenas are brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teen was conscious throughout the attack</v>

1751
01:21:46.271 --> 01:21:50.220
<v Speaker 1>and now undergoing surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Huh.</v>

1752
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Only saved when his uncle heard him</v>
<v Speaker 1>being dragged like a blanket Hyena was</v>

1753
01:21:55.450 --> 01:21:58.630
<v Speaker 1>looking for food had been seen in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>week before.</v>

1754
01:21:58.631 --> 01:22:01.950
<v Speaker 1>The attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever seen a Hyena hose,</v>

1755
01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.450
<v Speaker 1>things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're killers.</v>

1756
01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why they're there.</v>

1757
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:08.740
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature has this very efficient system.</v>

1758
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:12.400
<v Speaker 1>All they do is kill and they don't care</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is they're killing it.</v>

1759
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa in particular is so fascinating</v>

1760
01:22:15.941 --> 01:22:17.890
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to go on vacation there with</v>

1761
01:22:17.891 --> 01:22:19.840
<v Speaker 1>my family this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I found out we'd have to get a bunch</v>

1762
01:22:19.841 --> 01:22:21.700
<v Speaker 1>of shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went to Tanzania,</v>

1763
01:22:21.701 --> 01:22:22.840
<v Speaker 1>did you get a bunch of shots?</v>

1764
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:28.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not giving my six year olds some</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shots so they can endure Zika,</v>

1765
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:32.140
<v Speaker 1>that Orient Malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>

1766
01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.600
<v Speaker 1>How much did you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of shots did you have to get?</v>

1767
01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got like I think four different shots,</v>

1768
01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:41.290
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in camp there,</v>

1769
01:22:41.291 --> 01:22:43.870
<v Speaker 1>there was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the workers there had malaria.</v>

1770
01:22:44.050 --> 01:22:47.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not what you want to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what was the,</v>

1771
01:22:47.081 --> 01:22:50.170
<v Speaker 1>what was it like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just weak and you know,</v>

1772
01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:54.160
<v Speaker 1>sick and given him antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're doing.</v>

1773
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they even have antibiotics</v>

1774
01:22:57.701 --> 01:22:58.690
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1775
01:22:58.850 --> 01:23:01.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a lot different than here,</v>

1776
01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:04.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a brutal place.</v>

1777
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:05.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is</v>

1778
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:09.820
<v Speaker 3>in this weird cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are so soft here.</v>

1779
01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:13.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think we're getting weaker and</v>

1780
01:23:13.241 --> 01:23:14.660
<v Speaker 3>weaker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1781
01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:16.420
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over there,</v>

1782
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:19.150
<v Speaker 3>if you're a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gone.</v>

1783
01:23:19.170 --> 01:23:20.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere where it's hard.</v>

1784
01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:22.480
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when things get rough,</v>

1785
01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:25.810
<v Speaker 3>when things are not rough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when people can relax.</v>

1786
01:23:25.811 --> 01:23:27.610
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the beautiful things</v>
<v Speaker 3>about cities.</v>

1787
01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:31.810
<v Speaker 3>We figured out a way to put up these</v>
<v Speaker 3>concrete structures that nothing can get</v>

1788
01:23:31.811 --> 01:23:32.471
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1789
01:23:32.471 --> 01:23:34.420
<v Speaker 3>no wild things can get in and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a break,</v>

1790
01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.340
<v Speaker 3>relax and eat chips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get fat.</v>

1791
01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:38.860
<v Speaker 3>But I hate it here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

1792
01:23:39.190 --> 01:23:42.850
<v Speaker 3>I like it in the mountains where I am</v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable,</v>

1793
01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.190
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1794
01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.590
<v Speaker 3>hopefully my training and my experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whatever keeps me alive.</v>

1795
01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:53.220
<v Speaker 3>But also there's a weird sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>electric feeling to that world,</v>

1796
01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:55.660
<v Speaker 3>this like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say electric,</v>

1797
01:23:55.661 --> 01:24:00.661
<v Speaker 3>but it's stimulating feeling to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>world when you're walking around in that</v>

1798
01:24:00.731 --> 01:24:05.110
<v Speaker 3>world and you're acutely aware that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are now part of this system and that you</v>

1799
01:24:05.111 --> 01:24:07.780
<v Speaker 3>could turn the wrong corner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>run into a fucking grizzly bear.</v>

1800
01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:10.480
<v Speaker 3>You could turn the wrong corner and run</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a mountain lion.</v>

1801
01:24:10.490 --> 01:24:12.910
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't happen a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it could happen.</v>

1802
01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.470
<v Speaker 3>You could fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1803
01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.600
<v Speaker 3>like your friend Roy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1804
01:24:16.601 --> 01:24:17.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1805
01:24:17.591 --> 01:24:18.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where,</v>

1806
01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:21.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where I feel most alive</v>

1807
01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.200
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to be,</v>

1808
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not in tune,</v>

1809
01:24:25.710 --> 01:24:28.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what happens.</v>

1810
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:33.870
<v Speaker 3>It seems like also that there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some reward systems that are built into</v>

1811
01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:38.650
<v Speaker 3>being a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get like little switches that gets</v>

1812
01:24:38.651 --> 01:24:41.250
<v Speaker 3>snapped on when you're out there that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't,</v>

1813
01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:46.500
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's what I've seen with many people</v>

1814
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:49.130
<v Speaker 3>who are very smart people who become</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunters,</v>

1815
01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:53.890
<v Speaker 3>who then they start talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They articulate really similar thoughts</v>

1816
01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:57.190
<v Speaker 3>that it becomes a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the,</v>

1817
01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:02.540
<v Speaker 3>the act of consuming becomes very</v>
<v Speaker 3>different when you acquire it the hard</v>

1818
01:25:02.981 --> 01:25:03.250
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1819
01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same as.</v>

1820
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:07.930
<v Speaker 3>There's a feeling that you get is a much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more muted version of it,</v>

1821
01:25:07.931 --> 01:25:11.650
<v Speaker 3>but it's a really good feeling that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get when you grow a salad and you're</v>

1822
01:25:11.651 --> 01:25:13.910
<v Speaker 3>eating that salad grew in your own yard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1823
01:25:14.170 --> 01:25:16.840
<v Speaker 3>but that's a much more muted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1824
01:25:16.890 --> 01:25:18.880
<v Speaker 3>it's a beautiful feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels nice.</v>

1825
01:25:18.881 --> 01:25:21.280
<v Speaker 3>It feels satisfying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's much more muted.</v>

1826
01:25:21.281 --> 01:25:23.700
<v Speaker 3>Like when I cook an elk steak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1827
01:25:23.701 --> 01:25:25.190
<v Speaker 3>That's something that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1828
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:28.180
<v Speaker 3>I was there for the entire time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1829
01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:31.180
<v Speaker 3>when it got shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>helped cut it up and carry it out.</v>

1830
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:32.143
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

1831
01:25:32.410 --> 01:25:37.410
<v Speaker 3>there's a memory attached to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a primal satisfaction attached</v>

1832
01:25:37.631 --> 01:25:39.820
<v Speaker 3>to that and there's also this feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1833
01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:43.720
<v Speaker 3>I know that thing wasn't penned up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that thing didn't get stuffed</v>

1834
01:25:43.721 --> 01:25:46.660
<v Speaker 3>full of hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that thing didn't get tortured</v>

1835
01:25:46.661 --> 01:25:51.040
<v Speaker 3>before it died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it wasn't corralled into this</v>

1836
01:25:51.041 --> 01:25:54.040
<v Speaker 3>area and then they shoot a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>piston into its brain while it's</v>

1837
01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:54.640
<v Speaker 3>watching.</v>

1838
01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.180
<v Speaker 3>All of his friends die in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1839
01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:00.310
<v Speaker 3>I know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they know.</v>

1840
01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:01.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they have friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1841
01:26:01.810 --> 01:26:05.480
<v Speaker 3>Debt buddies to hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a pit in the pin.</v>

1842
01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:08.930
<v Speaker 3>They hang out until,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until pussies out like many other</v>

1843
01:26:08.931 --> 01:26:11.000
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the backstabbing begins.</v>

1844
01:26:11.001 --> 01:26:13.730
<v Speaker 3>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stab each other in the back with</v>

1845
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:16.730
<v Speaker 3>their antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's brutal out there.</v>

1846
01:26:16.731 --> 01:26:17.564
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

1847
01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:21.920
<v Speaker 3>that connection a hunter has with it</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the animal and,</v>

1848
01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:27.340
<v Speaker 3>and just be able to bring that home and</v>
<v Speaker 3>cook it up and sit around the table.</v>

1849
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:29.480
<v Speaker 3>That's just with your family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1850
01:26:29.481 --> 01:26:32.570
<v Speaker 3>that's how it's always been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it's always been since the</v>

1851
01:26:32.571 --> 01:26:36.260
<v Speaker 3>beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being a provider is a powerful thing and</v>

1852
01:26:36.261 --> 01:26:39.110
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if this new trend away from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1853
01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.200
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what's going on with human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings and uh,</v>

1854
01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:46.700
<v Speaker 3>if it is just a natural progression of</v>
<v Speaker 3>creating structures and safety and</v>

1855
01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:49.970
<v Speaker 3>society in the sense of civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way we think of it today,</v>

1856
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:55.160
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it's a natural sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>progression to slowly but surely move</v>

1857
01:26:55.161 --> 01:26:58.610
<v Speaker 3>away from that world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wild world,</v>

1858
01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:03.290
<v Speaker 3>and to get more and more accustomed with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of us creating our own food</v>

1859
01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:07.610
<v Speaker 3>from some other way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like by detaching from how you grow your</v>

1860
01:27:07.611 --> 01:27:09.890
<v Speaker 3>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by detaching from where your meat comes</v>

1861
01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:12.980
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were like setting ourselves up to</v>

1862
01:27:12.981 --> 01:27:17.300
<v Speaker 3>go further and further down this road of</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really being an animal anymore.</v>

1863
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Being some new kind of weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going that way.</v>

1864
01:27:21.170 --> 01:27:22.150
<v Speaker 3>You're not going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1865
01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.220
<v Speaker 3>you're not going that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1866
01:27:23.370 --> 01:27:24.470
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this life.</v>

1867
01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Now in this life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1868
01:27:25.891 --> 01:27:28.550
<v Speaker 3>you're in this sort of a transitionary</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>

1869
01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Or the culture is our society as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>demon.</v>

1870
01:27:31.071 --> 01:27:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Ends are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're digging and digging in as a,</v>

1871
01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.600
<v Speaker 3>as a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going old school staying old</v>

1872
01:27:35.601 --> 01:27:38.210
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it me as a person who like halfassed</v>

1873
01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:41.330
<v Speaker 3>scientist who tries to study human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings trying to figure out what the</v>

1874
01:27:41.331 --> 01:27:43.100
<v Speaker 3>fuck I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't even use the word scientists</v>

1875
01:27:43.101 --> 01:27:44.720
<v Speaker 3>loosely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something else,</v>

1876
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.910
<v Speaker 3>whatever I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I look at it,</v>

1877
01:27:46.911 --> 01:27:49.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is going on here?</v>

1878
01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:54.460
<v Speaker 3>Because there's clearly something going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on with human beings as an organism.</v>

1879
01:27:56.050 --> 01:28:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Like there's something going on where</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're moving away from the natural world</v>

1880
01:28:00.231 --> 01:28:02.960
<v Speaker 3>with cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're moving away from the natural world</v>

1881
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:05.150
<v Speaker 3>with our ability to control our</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

1882
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:09.290
<v Speaker 3>It's hot as fuck outside right now and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I feel great.</v>

1883
01:28:09.291 --> 01:28:10.160
<v Speaker 3>How are you feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jamie?</v>

1884
01:28:10.161 --> 01:28:10.994
<v Speaker 3>Field?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1885
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:12.230
<v Speaker 3>Ace is nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1886
01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:15.470
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we figured out a way to live in these</v>

1887
01:28:15.471 --> 01:28:19.880
<v Speaker 3>harsh environments with no consequences</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever except on in the environment</v>

1888
01:28:19.881 --> 01:28:21.460
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's consequences about the.</v>

1889
01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:26.240
<v Speaker 3>But there's also this detachment from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the concerns of the world and it's one</v>

1890
01:28:26.241 --> 01:28:30.440
<v Speaker 3>of the things that I've always said</v>
<v Speaker 3>about La is that La is one of the most</v>

1891
01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:34.970
<v Speaker 3>unnatural places in the world because</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just because everyone's full of shit</v>

1892
01:28:34.971 --> 01:28:37.250
<v Speaker 3>because they're trying to get you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think there's something they're not.</v>

1893
01:28:37.251 --> 01:28:41.510
<v Speaker 3>So you put them in a TV show or a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also because it doesn't rain here.</v>

1894
01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:43.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always perfect.</v>

1895
01:28:43.161 --> 01:28:47.930
<v Speaker 3>You could sleep outside and you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not that much wildlife worry</v>

1896
01:28:47.931 --> 01:28:49.520
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many mountain lions,</v>

1897
01:28:49.521 --> 01:28:51.500
<v Speaker 3>they killed all the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even get in car accidents</v>

1898
01:28:51.501 --> 01:28:54.350
<v Speaker 3>against deere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like our connection to wildlife is like</v>

1899
01:28:54.351 --> 01:28:56.060
<v Speaker 3>fucking nil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1900
01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:58.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think being comfortable all the</v>

1901
01:28:58.971 --> 01:28:59.870
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

1902
01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>La and cities</v>

1903
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.880
<v Speaker 1>like La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1904
01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.340
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not good to,</v>

1905
01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:09.720
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminate all the challenges of being a</v>

1906
01:29:09.721 --> 01:29:10.770
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1907
01:29:10.771 --> 01:29:13.590
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like getting out there and</v>

1908
01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:17.430
<v Speaker 1>just being immersed in challenge because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1909
01:29:17.431 --> 01:29:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you appreciate how good you have</v>

1910
01:29:19.681 --> 01:29:22.470
<v Speaker 1>a when you never have it hard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a big point.</v>

1911
01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a big point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big point.</v>

1912
01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.080
<v Speaker 1>That was hammered home for me when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>came back from Prince of Wales.</v>

1913
01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:29.880
<v Speaker 1>From unsuccessful hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1914
01:29:30.150 --> 01:29:32.250
<v Speaker 1>We're out there for five or six days I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1915
01:29:33.230 --> 01:29:36.150
<v Speaker 1>and it was pouring rain every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was cold as shit.</v>

1916
01:29:36.151 --> 01:29:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Every day your fingers are pruned up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're freezing your dick off and you</v>

1917
01:29:39.301 --> 01:29:43.410
<v Speaker 1>just can't wait to get back home and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got back home to La,</v>

1918
01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:44.970
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was glorious.</v>

1919
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.920
<v Speaker 1>I called up or now I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1920
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:48.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever been happier in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

1921
01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Everyday was like so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1922
01:29:51.150 --> 01:29:54.750
<v Speaker 1>It felt so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was so nice to see my friends.</v>

1923
01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:59.340
<v Speaker 1>It was so nice to to see the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called up Callan and he said the same</v>

1924
01:29:59.341 --> 01:30:00.420
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1925
01:30:00.421 --> 01:30:01.980
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel great.</v>

1926
01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I just feel so thankful to be back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel so thankful to be in a city where</v>

1927
01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:09.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to worry about where my</v>
<v Speaker 1>food comes from.</v>

1928
01:30:09.041 --> 01:30:10.560
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to worry about starving to</v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

1929
01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you appreciate this weird thing</v>

1930
01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:18.090
<v Speaker 1>that we've gotten and I think when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't experience both things,</v>

1931
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:19.680
<v Speaker 1>that's when you take it for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1932
01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you never would have went,</v>

1933
01:30:21.450 --> 01:30:23.970
<v Speaker 1>you never even had those feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1934
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.200
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important.</v>

1935
01:30:25.201 --> 01:30:30.201
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an that's why I like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to take on the challenge of</v>

1936
01:30:30.661 --> 01:30:32.370
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to learn more about it.</v>

1937
01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the byproduct yet we've talked about the</v>

1938
01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:39.150
<v Speaker 1>positive byproduct is you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservation is another byproduct is</v>

1939
01:30:39.151 --> 01:30:42.310
<v Speaker 1>you're going to realize what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to be uncomfortable and</v>

1940
01:30:42.311 --> 01:30:43.144
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1941
01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.870
<v Speaker 1>conversely you're going to realize how</v>
<v Speaker 1>good we have it and um,</v>

1942
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:50.900
<v Speaker 1>how you appreciate being able to walk up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the tap and fill up a glass of water.</v>

1943
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been on a lot of haunts were just</v>

1944
01:30:54.331 --> 01:30:56.520
<v Speaker 1>getting water was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1945
01:30:56.610 --> 01:30:59.040
<v Speaker 1>here's the focus of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to find water.</v>

1946
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1947
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were drinking buffalo piss water.</v>

1948
01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you guys weren't.</v>

1949
01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:11.440
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy story because it also</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved crocodiles when you guys were</v>

1950
01:31:11.671 --> 01:31:16.290
<v Speaker 1>in Australia and you decided you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy fucking Adam green tree decided</v>

1951
01:31:16.291 --> 01:31:20.550
<v Speaker 1>let's bring no food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go out into the Bush where it's 120</v>

1952
01:31:20.551 --> 01:31:22.550
<v Speaker 1>degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll definitely shoot a buffalo and</v>

1953
01:31:22.551 --> 01:31:23.460
<v Speaker 1>we'll just eat that.</v>

1954
01:31:23.490 --> 01:31:24.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1955
01:31:24.271 --> 01:31:24.770
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna.</v>

1956
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:26.910
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna live quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live off the land.</v>

1957
01:31:27.450 --> 01:31:30.240
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably just happy he found</v>

1958
01:31:30.241 --> 01:31:32.560
<v Speaker 1>someone dumb enough to do that with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday night.</v>

1959
01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:34.130
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you listened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mate.</v>

1960
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else has me to fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1961
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:40.320
<v Speaker 1>it hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a Owen Strano was there too.</v>

1962
01:31:40.321 --> 01:31:42.120
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Owen,</v>

1963
01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I think he might've brought man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he,</v>

1964
01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:48.990
<v Speaker 1>would he have maybe a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of a,</v>

1965
01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:51.150
<v Speaker 1>a bar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he had.</v>

1966
01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I had half of a trail mix thing that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>bought at the airport,</v>

1967
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:55.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

1968
01:31:55.770 --> 01:31:57.540
<v Speaker 1>that was like gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

1969
01:31:57.541 --> 01:31:59.530
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to live off the land and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1970
01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:00.633
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1971
01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:02.140
<v Speaker 1>it was miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1972
01:32:02.141 --> 01:32:04.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so did he talk you into this?</v>

1973
01:32:04.181 --> 01:32:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Was it your idea or his idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who?</v>

1974
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:06.780
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his idea,</v>

1975
01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:07.390
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1976
01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:08.223
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

1977
01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:10.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought sounded awesome.</v>

1978
01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:12.700
<v Speaker 1>He's out there shooting the horses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats should go.</v>

1979
01:32:12.701 --> 01:32:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's live off the land.</v>

1980
01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it sounded great.</v>

1981
01:32:18.150 --> 01:32:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1982
01:32:19.931 --> 01:32:21.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm used to being miserable.</v>

1983
01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:23.560
<v Speaker 1>A little food would have been nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as you know,</v>

1984
01:32:23.561 --> 01:32:28.270
<v Speaker 1>like I said today I need to eat like</v>
<v Speaker 1>every hour because you run so much.</v>

1985
01:32:28.271 --> 01:32:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Actually I'm starving right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1986
01:32:31.450 --> 01:32:33.880
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well before we launched the new Cameron</v>

1987
01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Hanes podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we will this afternoon.</v>

1988
01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get you a protein bar.</v>

1989
01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.290
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1990
01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I saw I saw a quest bar back there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1991
01:32:40.331 --> 01:32:42.550
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got boxes of shit back there.</v>

1992
01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of I'm going to steal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

1993
01:32:44.651 --> 01:32:47.440
<v Speaker 1>So just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just living off the land took on a whole</v>

1994
01:32:47.530 --> 01:32:51.580
<v Speaker 1>nother challenge to a hard hunt already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was down for sure.</v>

1995
01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:56.050
<v Speaker 1>So you guys were eating only things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had shot and then drinking water</v>

1996
01:32:56.051 --> 01:32:59.560
<v Speaker 1>that you found in the water that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>found was all filled with buffalo piss?</v>

1997
01:32:59.650 --> 01:33:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because again,</v>

1998
01:33:01.090 --> 01:33:02.830
<v Speaker 1>too many buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1999
01:33:03.170 --> 01:33:05.020
<v Speaker 1>when you say too many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2000
01:33:05.021 --> 01:33:09.070
<v Speaker 1>if anybody's ever watched any of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos on the numbers of buffalo from</v>

2001
01:33:09.071 --> 01:33:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are enormous.</v>

2002
01:33:10.570 --> 01:33:12.130
<v Speaker 1>What do the Cape Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they know,</v>

2003
01:33:12.131 --> 01:33:14.860
<v Speaker 1>these are water buffalo water buffalo</v>
<v Speaker 1>and North Cape Buffaloes.</v>

2004
01:33:14.861 --> 01:33:16.530
<v Speaker 1>African won the fight the lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2005
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Enormous giant beasts that are videos on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2006
01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge,</v>

2007
01:33:23.471 --> 01:33:25.450
<v Speaker 1>huge herds of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2008
01:33:25.570 --> 01:33:28.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretty wary still.</v>

2009
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're big animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2010
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.440
<v Speaker 1>they're not quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite as worried as a Cape Buffalo,</v>

2011
01:33:35.441 --> 01:33:37.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't think because they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>lions hunting them,</v>

2012
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:39.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they're around water,</v>

2013
01:33:39.671 --> 01:33:41.380
<v Speaker 1>they're used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crocodiles been in there.</v>

2014
01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:43.960
<v Speaker 1>They definitely are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are used to,</v>

2015
01:33:43.961 --> 01:33:45.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking out for themselves.</v>

2016
01:33:45.731 --> 01:33:47.980
<v Speaker 1>So they're huge animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2017
01:33:48.130 --> 01:33:51.130
<v Speaker 1>they can be dangerous because just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're so big.</v>

2018
01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:54.370
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's their survivors for sure.</v>

2019
01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.950
<v Speaker 1>If that's another weird animal to hunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Australia,</v>

2020
01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:59.680
<v Speaker 1>they hunt domestic cows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2021
01:33:59.681 --> 01:34:01.990
<v Speaker 1>call him scrubble scribbles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2022
01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.800
<v Speaker 1>And what a scrub Boulez is a domestic</v>
<v Speaker 1>cow that got loose,</v>

2023
01:34:05.801 --> 01:34:06.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2024
01:34:06.401 --> 01:34:11.401
<v Speaker 1>many generations ago and now have become</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely feral and you're dealing with</v>

2025
01:34:11.890 --> 01:34:16.630
<v Speaker 1>bowls and you know how like when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ride bulls folks that they buck and kick</v>

2026
01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:20.170
<v Speaker 1>and you know how the matador stands in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle and the bull just fucking</v>

2027
01:34:20.171 --> 01:34:21.340
<v Speaker 1>charges him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tries to kill him.</v>

2028
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what bulls do in the wild times</v>

2029
01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:27.610
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have these wild for hyper</v>

2030
01:34:27.611 --> 01:34:31.750
<v Speaker 1>aggressive masses of muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a video,</v>

2031
01:34:31.751 --> 01:34:33.490
<v Speaker 1>it says cams raw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>

2032
01:34:33.491 --> 01:34:35.170
<v Speaker 1>What does the net cams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raw and uncut.</v>

2033
01:34:35.171 --> 01:34:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Ozzie water buff heart shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2034
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:42.370
<v Speaker 1>And this is you sneaking up on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive animal.</v>

2035
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:45.000
<v Speaker 1>You've got to walk super slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2036
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:48.130
<v Speaker 1>The thing about it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll pick up movement,</v>

2037
01:34:48.131 --> 01:34:51.970
<v Speaker 1>but as he's feeding there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I can move so I just go very</v>

2038
01:34:51.971 --> 01:34:54.160
<v Speaker 1>slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my range finder up near my face so</v>

2039
01:34:54.161 --> 01:34:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to reach for it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do a bunch of extra movement there.</v>

2040
01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.390
<v Speaker 2>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2041
01:34:59.450 --> 01:35:00.770
<v Speaker 2>how far away is he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right here?</v>

2042
01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Probably 50 yards now with the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that big?</v>

2043
01:35:06.170 --> 01:35:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Why did you decide to keep walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards him?</v>

2044
01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Closer is better with a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2045
01:35:10.881 --> 01:35:13.790
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you felt like you could get closer so</v>

2046
01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:18.050
<v Speaker 2>you might as well just keep going until</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize that you have to draw.</v>

2047
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2048
01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:19.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he.</v>

2049
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:22.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm waiting for them to get broad side</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's an animal that big.</v>

2050
01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

2051
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:27.410
<v Speaker 2>you just have to wait for a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadside shot.</v>

2052
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:31.070
<v Speaker 2>And so here I am arranging them as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk and now he's getting ready to go</v>

2053
01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:33.020
<v Speaker 2>broadside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an important point,</v>

2054
01:35:33.021 --> 01:35:35.360
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because shot placement is something that</v>

2055
01:35:35.361 --> 01:35:38.720
<v Speaker 2>people that don't understand hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how difficult it is to not</v>

2056
01:35:38.721 --> 01:35:41.990
<v Speaker 2>just have a shot on an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but have an animal be in position to</v>

2057
01:35:41.991 --> 01:35:42.824
<v Speaker 2>take the shot.</v>

2058
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I was watching a television show on guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were hunting water buffalo with a</v>

2059
01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:50.120
<v Speaker 2>bow and Arrow and I saw a guy take a</v>
<v Speaker 2>frontal shot.</v>

2060
01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:51.333
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2061
01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:53.990
<v Speaker 2>he's not feeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not moving because he's.</v>

2062
01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:56.840
<v Speaker 2>His head's up with this peripheral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could see me.</v>

2063
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:59.300
<v Speaker 2>So he thinks something's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>

2064
01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:02.240
<v Speaker 2>He probably caught something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean his ears covering his eye right</v>

2065
01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:04.100
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be that focused.</v>

2066
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:06.410
<v Speaker 2>So I know he's not looking at me right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2067
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:09.980
<v Speaker 2>but he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might've thought he saw something so</v>

2068
01:36:09.981 --> 01:36:12.410
<v Speaker 2>he just kind of chilling out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>June is cut.</v>

2069
01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:14.870
<v Speaker 2>And how hard is it to stay still here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2070
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:15.980
<v Speaker 2>it's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I need,</v>

2071
01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:19.850
<v Speaker 2>I need him to go broadside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need that close leg to go forward</v>

2072
01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.770
<v Speaker 2>because if I just draw back and shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2073
01:36:21.771 --> 01:36:25.130
<v Speaker 2>without that guaranteed going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>unsuccessful.</v>

2074
01:36:25.131 --> 01:36:27.710
<v Speaker 2>So I need that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that lady to go forward that close like</v>

2075
01:36:27.711 --> 01:36:31.130
<v Speaker 2>right here now that opened up his</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitals.</v>

2076
01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

2077
01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Right in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how far away was that?</v>

2078
01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:41.340
<v Speaker 2>That was 39 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So their,</v>

2079
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:45.950
<v Speaker 2>their heart sits a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that you see that blood coming</v>

2080
01:36:45.951 --> 01:36:48.670
<v Speaker 2>out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The heart sits like right next to it.</v>

2081
01:36:48.671 --> 01:36:49.080
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2082
01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:50.030
<v Speaker 2>it's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2083
01:36:50.031 --> 01:36:54.470
<v Speaker 2>It's forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's forward from an elk would be a</v>

2084
01:36:54.471 --> 01:36:56.750
<v Speaker 2>little more back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But basically you have to go right</v>

2085
01:36:56.751 --> 01:36:59.180
<v Speaker 2>through that front leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2086
01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I shot it really heavy Arrow and 90</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds,</v>

2087
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:04.630
<v Speaker 2>that's a 90 pound weight right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can see he's,</v>

2088
01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:06.980
<v Speaker 2>he's already week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's only been,</v>

2089
01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:09.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a minute and he's,</v>

2090
01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:12.530
<v Speaker 2>he's about done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to actually shoot through</v>

2091
01:37:12.531 --> 01:37:16.280
<v Speaker 2>the leg itself to get to the heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless he's quartering away from you.</v>

2092
01:37:16.281 --> 01:37:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2093
01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:19.190
<v Speaker 2>quarter in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is they're so big,</v>

2094
01:37:19.191 --> 01:37:24.191
<v Speaker 2>so if it's too to quartering away their</v>
<v Speaker 2>stomachs big and it's full of grass.</v>

2095
01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:29.540
<v Speaker 2>So that could essentially be like for an</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arrow to go all the way through a bunch</v>

2096
01:37:29.541 --> 01:37:31.550
<v Speaker 2>of grass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wet grass.</v>

2097
01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:35.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean probably not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're shooting through ribs that</v>

2098
01:37:35.571 --> 01:37:37.700
<v Speaker 2>are as thick as two by fours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2099
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:41.120
<v Speaker 2>So what a crazy animal he's about bled</v>
<v Speaker 2>out right here.</v>

2100
01:37:41.121 --> 01:37:43.130
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing with a bow,</v>

2101
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean these things fight each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he has no idea what happened.</v>

2102
01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:50.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just like no clue that he's used to</v>

2103
01:37:50.961 --> 01:37:54.890
<v Speaker 2>getting jabbed with horns or tree</v>
<v Speaker 2>branches or all sorts of stuff.</v>

2104
01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 2>All he knows is he's</v>

2105
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.940
<v Speaker 1>lost a lot of blood and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over crazy.</v>

2106
01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you guys,</v>

2107
01:38:02.161 --> 01:38:05.940
<v Speaker 1>when you went there and you didn't bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>any water with you,</v>

2108
01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:09.150
<v Speaker 1>you have to filter that piss water</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow,</v>

2109
01:38:09.151 --> 01:38:10.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2110
01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:11.880
<v Speaker 1>What are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you filter it with?</v>

2111
01:38:12.810 --> 01:38:15.320
<v Speaker 1>We had a water filter and we had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>steripen.</v>

2112
01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:18.030
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like ultraviolet light.</v>

2113
01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:21.060
<v Speaker 1>You put in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit it with the ultraviolet light</v>

2114
01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:25.980
<v Speaker 1>and then it supposedly disinfected water</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly is a key world.</v>

2115
01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.520
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why I throw out that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we filtered it.</v>

2116
01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:33.190
<v Speaker 1>We stare a pendant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we poured it through a shirt and it</v>

2117
01:38:33.191 --> 01:38:36.320
<v Speaker 1>still smelled like buffalo pis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2118
01:38:36.330 --> 01:38:39.450
<v Speaker 1>it is buffalo pis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We drank paralyzed buffalo pet.</v>

2119
01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:43.260
<v Speaker 1>We drank it and we didn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw something online the other day.</v>

2120
01:38:43.261 --> 01:38:46.800
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to figure out how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ocean is whale piss.</v>

2121
01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Like how many?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many whales are there?</v>

2122
01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:53.070
<v Speaker 1>How long had they been peeing in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean?</v>

2123
01:38:53.130 --> 01:38:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of that?</v>

2124
01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Where does it go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of the ocean as well pissed and</v>

2125
01:38:57.091 --> 01:38:59.490
<v Speaker 1>we should protest them doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was dirty,</v>

2126
01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:00.790
<v Speaker 1>stinky wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2127
01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:03.030
<v Speaker 1>So selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a sad thing though,</v>

2128
01:39:03.031 --> 01:39:05.310
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where this whale died in.</v>

2129
01:39:05.311 --> 01:39:06.144
<v Speaker 1>When the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2130
01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:09.720
<v Speaker 1>blue whale was beached,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they examine the contents of its stomach</v>

2131
01:39:09.721 --> 01:39:14.700
<v Speaker 1>and it was filled with fishing nets and</v>
<v Speaker 1>plastic bags because apparently whales</v>

2132
01:39:14.701 --> 01:39:19.350
<v Speaker 1>eat a lot of squid and they get confused</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that stuff,</v>

2133
01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:21.990
<v Speaker 1>like plastic bags and things along those</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>

2134
01:39:21.991 --> 01:39:26.580
<v Speaker 1>And they think that it's food and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got an intestinal blockage.</v>

2135
01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:29.550
<v Speaker 1>So it died by being backed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2136
01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:32.490
<v Speaker 1>That's a rough way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is too bad.</v>

2137
01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:35.550
<v Speaker 1>They don't have whale doctors either in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean where they go,</v>

2138
01:39:35.610 --> 01:39:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Hey doc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not feeling so good here.</v>

2139
01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:40.110
<v Speaker 1>So something's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't shaved in a week.</v>

2140
01:39:41.010 --> 01:39:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to check you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2141
01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whale is coming out.</v>

2142
01:39:44.821 --> 01:39:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Bloody good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world,</v>

2143
01:39:48.630 --> 01:39:53.100
<v Speaker 1>the world of harsh nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in that world.</v>

2144
01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:56.580
<v Speaker 1>We just don't think we do because we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>created this super cool thing called</v>

2145
01:39:56.581 --> 01:39:58.980
<v Speaker 1>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2146
01:39:59.130 --> 01:40:02.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's so cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we definitely created it.</v>

2147
01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.170
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wearing clothes that was created</v>

2148
01:40:04.171 --> 01:40:06.590
<v Speaker 1>in cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to watch those creating</v>

2149
01:40:06.630 --> 01:40:07.800
<v Speaker 1>cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2150
01:40:07.801 --> 01:40:09.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bow was created in the city.</v>

2151
01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I have a fit band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that same thing.</v>

2152
01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:13.860
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't tell you the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it does.</v>

2153
01:40:13.861 --> 01:40:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

2154
01:40:14.791 --> 01:40:18.030
<v Speaker 1>It's got to tell you the time it says I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got all time.</v>

2155
01:40:18.031 --> 01:40:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Record seven hours and 49 minutes sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2156
01:40:20.851 --> 01:40:22.860
<v Speaker 1>that's an all time record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2157
01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:26.580
<v Speaker 1>congratulation recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations is in order.</v>

2158
01:40:26.581 --> 01:40:28.080
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens is you get to stay</v>

2159
01:40:28.081 --> 01:40:30.350
<v Speaker 1>in a hotel to work that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2160
01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:31.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually does have the time.</v>

2161
01:40:31.530 --> 01:40:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

2162
01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:37.050
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to watch a car that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to drive around to get to these</v>

2163
01:40:37.051 --> 01:40:42.051
<v Speaker 1>hunting spots that's all created in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>city or you gotta go all this technology</v>

2164
01:40:42.511 --> 01:40:45.630
<v Speaker 1>created by people in civilization that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're allowed to relax,</v>

2165
01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.090
<v Speaker 1>not worried about being eaten by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

2166
01:40:48.091 --> 01:40:48.810
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2167
01:40:48.810 --> 01:40:51.390
<v Speaker 1>these regular bows that we're using are</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of bullshit.</v>

2168
01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:53.620
<v Speaker 1>We need some cams and these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2169
01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Like as</v>

2170
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.500
<v Speaker 3>you pull it back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it lets off at a certain weight and then</v>

2171
01:40:56.501 --> 01:40:59.620
<v Speaker 3>it's got more power going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a bunch of engineers went to</v>

2172
01:40:59.621 --> 01:41:01.750
<v Speaker 3>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wrote things down on paper and</v>

2173
01:41:01.751 --> 01:41:03.820
<v Speaker 3>uncover all that stuff created in</v>
<v Speaker 3>cities.</v>

2174
01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:08.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like the city and the transition that</v>

2175
01:41:08.471 --> 01:41:13.210
<v Speaker 3>some organisms are going through from</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild to civilize actually makes it</v>

2176
01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.790
<v Speaker 3>possible for you to exist in the wild</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2177
01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:17.890
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like they'll hunting is</v>

2178
01:41:17.891 --> 01:41:20.110
<v Speaker 3>conservation thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How ironic</v>

2179
01:41:21.630 --> 01:41:24.370
<v Speaker 3>is something positive to a city?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're saying?</v>

2180
01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>

2181
01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:27.790
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen man,</v>

2182
01:41:28.150 --> 01:41:31.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm not into working at a factory for 16</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours a day making iphones,</v>

2183
01:41:31.751 --> 01:41:34.900
<v Speaker 3>but if somebody wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have an iphone and I wouldn't</v>

2184
01:41:34.901 --> 01:41:37.540
<v Speaker 3>be able to tell you that you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>press that button twice or shut off your</v>

2185
01:41:37.541 --> 01:41:39.890
<v Speaker 3>apps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did learn something today like you.</v>

2186
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.070
<v Speaker 3>We all need each other as awesome.</v>

2187
01:41:42.090 --> 01:41:47.090
<v Speaker 3>And for a guy like you who is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>invested in living in the wild and</v>

2188
01:41:47.621 --> 01:41:49.360
<v Speaker 3>having this challenge of being in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild,</v>

2189
01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:53.710
<v Speaker 3>you need your nice under armour clothes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep your comfy and warm and drive</v>

2190
01:41:53.711 --> 01:41:56.350
<v Speaker 3>and you're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got your under or boots that were</v>

2191
01:41:56.351 --> 01:42:00.640
<v Speaker 3>made in some sort of a factory and</v>
<v Speaker 3>designed by some sort of an engineer and</v>

2192
01:42:00.641 --> 01:42:01.480
<v Speaker 3>you got your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2193
01:42:01.481 --> 01:42:03.880
<v Speaker 3>your watch tells you what altitude</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're at,</v>

2194
01:42:04.210 --> 01:42:07.900
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a part of your experience in this</v>

2195
01:42:07.901 --> 01:42:09.130
<v Speaker 3>wild world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2196
01:42:09.131 --> 01:42:13.660
<v Speaker 3>you got your gear and you got your sat</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone so you could call home,</v>

2197
01:42:13.890 --> 01:42:14.381
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2198
01:42:14.381 --> 01:42:16.630
<v Speaker 3>I just shot the biggest pool of my life</v>
<v Speaker 3>out here in the wild.</v>

2199
01:42:16.631 --> 01:42:20.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking to you from a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>satellite under miles in space.</v>

2200
01:42:20.650 --> 01:42:23.860
<v Speaker 3>But that's one reason why I'm not the</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest when they send me stuff to try</v>

2201
01:42:23.861 --> 01:42:26.770
<v Speaker 3>out because um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like being miserable.</v>

2202
01:42:26.771 --> 01:42:29.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the greatest for feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how it perform,</v>

2203
01:42:29.771 --> 01:42:31.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like being slightly miserable.</v>

2204
01:42:31.811 --> 01:42:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you'd go out there naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2205
01:42:33.670 --> 01:42:34.211
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2206
01:42:34.211 --> 01:42:37.180
<v Speaker 3>because that's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the big arguments that the</v>

2207
01:42:37.181 --> 01:42:39.420
<v Speaker 3>non hunters will use against the hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2208
01:42:39.970 --> 01:42:42.760
<v Speaker 3>you're a real man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you go kill the fucking oak</v>

2209
01:42:42.761 --> 01:42:43.940
<v Speaker 3>with your wounds?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2210
01:42:44.190 --> 01:42:45.460
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you go out with your hands?</v>

2211
01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:49.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the way to do it.</v>

2212
01:42:49.001 --> 01:42:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Dummy things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're not going to kill any of</v>

2213
01:42:51.011 --> 01:42:52.180
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You won't kill them.</v>

2214
01:42:52.181 --> 01:42:53.620
<v Speaker 3>That's not how you killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2215
01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like a rattle snake doesn't kill</v>

2216
01:42:55.331 --> 01:42:58.030
<v Speaker 3>you unless it uses poison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rattlesnake just tried to,</v>

2217
01:42:58.250 --> 01:43:00.730
<v Speaker 3>if they didn't have any poison and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to fight me,</v>

2218
01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:02.270
<v Speaker 3>are we going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to stab me with you.</v>

2219
01:43:02.271 --> 01:43:04.300
<v Speaker 3>A little stupid needles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm going to do?</v>

2220
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:06.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to crush your fucking head</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a rock.</v>

2221
01:43:06.101 --> 01:43:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Stupid because I have an opposable</v>
<v Speaker 3>thumb.</v>

2222
01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:09.280
<v Speaker 3>So after you stabbed me with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>needle,</v>

2223
01:43:09.281 --> 01:43:11.860
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't have any venom in it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you want to play fair.</v>

2224
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:13.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grab you by your head.</v>

2225
01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:16.000
<v Speaker 3>I smash it with a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wind dummy.</v>

2226
01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:17.290
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense though.</v>

2227
01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:19.900
<v Speaker 3>Dang it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2228
01:43:19.901 --> 01:43:23.410
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense because I'm a human being</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I come from a long line of human</v>

2229
01:43:23.411 --> 01:43:26.710
<v Speaker 3>beings and human beings had been</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking and more importantly we've been</v>

2230
01:43:26.711 --> 01:43:27.610
<v Speaker 3>communicating.</v>

2231
01:43:28.150 --> 01:43:30.160
<v Speaker 3>We've been communicating with language</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2232
01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:32.440
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we remember things that we learned and</v>

2233
01:43:32.441 --> 01:43:36.130
<v Speaker 3>we pass it on to others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think what's going on now,</v>

2234
01:43:36.190 --> 01:43:38.800
<v Speaker 3>even though it seems negative and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems weird,</v>

2235
01:43:38.801 --> 01:43:43.801
<v Speaker 3>and the world of wildlife and hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hunters versus people who don't</v>

2236
01:43:43.931 --> 01:43:46.720
<v Speaker 3>hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think ultimately it all balances out</v>

2237
01:43:46.721 --> 01:43:49.300
<v Speaker 3>really well because it all balances out</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an honest way.</v>

2238
01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with things no matter what,</v>

2239
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:55.250
<v Speaker 3>just like there's gonna be people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't agree with a lot of different</v>

2240
01:43:55.251 --> 01:43:56.510
<v Speaker 3>things that a lot of people think are</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>

2241
01:43:56.930 --> 01:44:00.430
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be disagreements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in those disagreements we're going</v>

2242
01:44:00.431 --> 01:44:02.960
<v Speaker 3>to find arguments that make sense and</v>
<v Speaker 3>arguments that don't make sense.</v>

2243
01:44:02.961 --> 01:44:07.961
<v Speaker 3>We're going to find people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>disingenuous and that are not being</v>

2244
01:44:08.391 --> 01:44:12.770
<v Speaker 3>totally honest with scientific facts</v>
<v Speaker 3>about nutrition,</v>

2245
01:44:12.771 --> 01:44:16.530
<v Speaker 3>scientific facts about whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans are omnivores or herbivores.</v>

2246
01:44:16.530 --> 01:44:18.350
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of dishonesty because</v>

2247
01:44:18.351 --> 01:44:21.260
<v Speaker 3>these debates are not debates about</v>
<v Speaker 3>facts and reason.</v>

2248
01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:24.050
<v Speaker 3>There are debates about ideology and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they only,</v>

2249
01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:29.120
<v Speaker 3>they only promote and subscribe to ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>that benefit their ideology.</v>

2250
01:44:29.121 --> 01:44:30.950
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you get it on both sides.</v>

2251
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:34.390
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the problems with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting is conservation hunting's</v>

2252
01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:35.330
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2253
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:37.250
<v Speaker 3>Ben O'brien's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got It right.</v>

2254
01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Funding to conservation is a byproduct</v>
<v Speaker 3>of hunting and hunting.</v>

2255
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Even if it wasn't conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just.</v>

2256
01:44:45.110 --> 01:44:48.020
<v Speaker 3>It was just something you do to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still.</v>

2257
01:44:48.650 --> 01:44:49.850
<v Speaker 3>It's still good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2258
01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still good.</v>

2259
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:53.690
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This conversation is important though.</v>

2260
01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:57.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will talk to for your hunting.</v>

2261
01:44:57.800 --> 01:44:59.750
<v Speaker 3>That's a big one man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2262
01:44:59.751 --> 01:45:00.590
<v Speaker 3>dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joseph Toy.</v>

2263
01:45:00.591 --> 01:45:02.180
<v Speaker 3>You're hooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2264
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:04.880
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just communication.</v>

2265
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:06.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About something that,</v>

2266
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:09.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read your fucking instagram.</v>

2267
01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's important.</v>

2268
01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:12.050
<v Speaker 3>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2269
01:45:12.051 --> 01:45:13.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2270
01:45:13.161 --> 01:45:15.710
<v Speaker 3>I try not to engage in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the negative stuff on that,</v>

2271
01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:17.150
<v Speaker 3>on instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do.</v>

2272
01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:19.590
<v Speaker 3>I do talk about the positive attributes</v>
<v Speaker 3>of hunting.</v>

2273
01:45:19.610 --> 01:45:20.870
<v Speaker 3>I show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2274
01:45:21.730 --> 01:45:24.700
<v Speaker 3>skinning out bare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I show my fees,</v>

2275
01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:29.000
<v Speaker 3>freezer full of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I show working hard to be the most</v>

2276
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:31.220
<v Speaker 3>effective ethical hunter I can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

2277
01:45:31.221 --> 01:45:32.660
<v Speaker 3>I try to share all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2278
01:45:32.661 --> 01:45:34.280
<v Speaker 3>But you also have people that back you</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2279
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:35.960
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of interesting that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>know that,</v>

2280
01:45:35.961 --> 01:45:39.050
<v Speaker 3>so you don't have to really engage in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of campaigns.</v>

2281
01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Soldiers out there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>battlefield whenever you put some animal</v>

<v Speaker 3>all my goodness,</v>

2284
01:45:46.191 --> 01:45:51.191
<v Speaker 3>and it's a lot of Europeans ally now</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that they're the most detached</v>

2285
01:45:52.221 --> 01:45:54.200
<v Speaker 3>because they have the fewest percentage</v>
<v Speaker 3>of hundreds over there.</v>

2286
01:45:54.510 --> 01:45:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I always get stuff from over</v>

2287
01:45:56.151 --> 01:45:58.610
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just have no concept or people.</v>

2288
01:45:58.670 --> 01:46:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Even Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2289
01:46:00.130 --> 01:46:02.750
<v Speaker 3>you get just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brazil's a big one.</v>

2290
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:03.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big one.</v>

2291
01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:05.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of hate from there.</v>

2292
01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:06.441
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2293
01:46:06.441 --> 01:46:08.780
<v Speaker 3>Someone was talking to me about that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other day.</v>

2294
01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.450
<v Speaker 3>Someone was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people get upset about it</v>

2295
01:46:11.451 --> 01:46:12.980
<v Speaker 3>might've been shamed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it Shane Dorian?</v>

2296
01:46:13.610 --> 01:46:17.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's what you,</v>

2297
01:46:17.490 --> 01:46:21.430
<v Speaker 3>when you hear the Robin Hood Story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when people think about Robin Hood</v>

2298
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:23.090
<v Speaker 3>Robinson and bridge and gives to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor.</v>

2299
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:27.530
<v Speaker 3>What people don't understand is that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>originally about food.</v>

2300
01:46:27.710 --> 01:46:31.790
<v Speaker 3>It was about him being able to hunt on</v>
<v Speaker 3>private land that the king owned because</v>

2301
01:46:31.791 --> 01:46:35.210
<v Speaker 3>people are starving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the original story of Robin</v>

2302
01:46:35.210 --> 01:46:37.400
<v Speaker 3>Hood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about Robin Hood going out and</v>

2303
01:46:37.401 --> 01:46:40.910
<v Speaker 3>shooting these animals and bringing meat</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to people.</v>

2304
01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Because in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of countries you are only able</v>

2305
01:46:46.371 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 3>to hunt on private land because there is</v>
<v Speaker 3>no public land.</v>

2306
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:55.320
<v Speaker 3>We are incredibly lucky in this country</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that I was in yellowstone this</v>

2307
01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:57.120
<v Speaker 3>weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>told you I went up there and fucking</v>

2308
01:46:57.121 --> 01:46:57.960
<v Speaker 3>amazing man.</v>

2309
01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:00.870
<v Speaker 3>What an amazing thing and that's a non</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting thing,</v>

2310
01:47:00.871 --> 01:47:01.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yellowstone.</v>

2311
01:47:01.831 --> 01:47:05.670
<v Speaker 3>You can't hunt there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this concept of public land,</v>

2312
01:47:05.671 --> 01:47:07.770
<v Speaker 3>this concept of more than a million</v>
<v Speaker 3>acres,</v>

2313
01:47:07.771 --> 01:47:10.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many millions of acres.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yellowstone is a big,</v>

2314
01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:15.030
<v Speaker 3>big chunk of property,</v>
<v Speaker 3>credible place that they can't build</v>

2315
01:47:15.031 --> 01:47:16.980
<v Speaker 3>things on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't replace it,</v>

2316
01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:22.160
<v Speaker 3>can't put them all there and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild and natural and it's ours.</v>

2317
01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:28.160
<v Speaker 3>It's by an act of Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back before they had fucking cars wrap</v>

2318
01:47:28.381 --> 01:47:31.290
<v Speaker 3>your head around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They figured out before they had cars,</v>

2319
01:47:31.291 --> 01:47:31.821
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

2320
01:47:31.821 --> 01:47:34.530
<v Speaker 3>we gotta do something about this place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is too good.</v>

2321
01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't let anybody corrupt this and</v>

2322
01:47:37.141 --> 01:47:39.660
<v Speaker 3>this is what was wrong with where we</v>
<v Speaker 3>came from,</v>

2323
01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:42.150
<v Speaker 3>where we came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody owned all the land.</v>

2324
01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:45.840
<v Speaker 3>It was all private and no one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't have a place where you could</v>

2325
01:47:45.841 --> 01:47:49.620
<v Speaker 3>just go backpacking and just camp out.</v>

2326
01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:54.030
<v Speaker 3>We have all these designated areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>designated areas that are all public</v>

2327
01:47:54.031 --> 01:47:58.650
<v Speaker 3>land owned by the taxpayers of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States and whether you appreciate</v>

2328
01:47:58.651 --> 01:48:02.040
<v Speaker 3>hunting or whether you just appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 3>camping or hiking or any of those</v>

2329
01:48:02.041 --> 01:48:04.830
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a beautiful thing in this</v>

2330
01:48:04.831 --> 01:48:09.320
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the wild world that we're the.</v>

2331
01:48:09.321 --> 01:48:13.770
<v Speaker 3>The actual beautiful environment of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these forests and most of the areas are</v>

2332
01:48:13.771 --> 01:48:17.160
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of the areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the areas designated as public land.</v>

2333
01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:19.830
<v Speaker 3>They're ours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're yours there.</v>

2334
01:48:19.831 --> 01:48:21.450
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>all the people that live here and even</v>

2336
01:48:23.371 --> 01:48:25.320
<v Speaker 3>if even if the listeners aren't gonna</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt,</v>

2337
01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:29.550
<v Speaker 3>which fine not everybody has to hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would say get out there to</v>

2338
01:48:29.551 --> 01:48:32.730
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone or there's some national</v>
<v Speaker 3>forest here in California,</v>

2339
01:48:32.731 --> 01:48:35.730
<v Speaker 3>some great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just get out there and experience life.</v>

2340
01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:37.920
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean because living in the city isn't</v>

2341
01:48:37.921 --> 01:48:39.210
<v Speaker 3>experiencing life well.</v>

2342
01:48:39.210 --> 01:48:42.210
<v Speaker 3>It's experiencing life in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's life that's.</v>

2343
01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:45.780
<v Speaker 3>But it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like you have a TV that only</v>

2344
01:48:45.781 --> 01:48:48.510
<v Speaker 3>shows three different colors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a little bit of red,</v>

2345
01:48:48.511 --> 01:48:49.740
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit of black.</v>

2346
01:48:49.741 --> 01:48:50.730
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get.</v>

2347
01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:53.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you don't know what it looks like if</v>

<v Speaker 3>you've never seen it before.</v>

2350
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:06.480
<v Speaker 3>You're experiencing a muted connection</v>
<v Speaker 3>with your food and a very muted</v>

2351
01:49:06.481 --> 01:49:11.280
<v Speaker 3>connection with wildlife that sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking uncomfortable and scary.</v>

2352
01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:12.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2353
01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:14.940

<v Speaker 3>It's bulk.</v>

<v Speaker 3>northern California.</v>

<v Speaker 3>buck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a timber.</v>

2363
01:49:36.210 --> 01:49:37.740
<v Speaker 3>It's great country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big,</v>

<v Speaker 3>People go there to make countertops.</v>

2395
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:58.400
<v Speaker 3>They're stealing from the land to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's counter.</v>

2396
01:50:58.670 --> 01:51:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But isn't that amazing?</v>

2397
01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:02.090
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2398
01:51:02.890 --> 01:51:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in Montana this past week and</v>

2399
01:51:05.101 --> 01:51:07.250
<v Speaker 3>went to the yellowstone thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2400
01:51:07.251 --> 01:51:11.300
<v Speaker 3>you just be driving and you would just</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive and just look down the street and</v>

2401
01:51:11.301 --> 01:51:12.134
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

2402
01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:14.450
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This place is crazy.</v>

2403
01:51:14.630 --> 01:51:16.790
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this view is like,</v>

2404
01:51:16.791 --> 01:51:18.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a drug,</v>

2405
01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:23.720
<v Speaker 3>like you're taking in this incredible</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain side covered in trees and the</v>

2406
01:51:23.721 --> 01:51:28.460
<v Speaker 3>sunlight is hitting the trees and it had</v>
<v Speaker 3>just got done raining and everything was</v>

2407
01:51:28.461 --> 01:51:31.640
<v Speaker 3>a vibrant and green and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a drug.</v>

2408
01:51:31.641 --> 01:51:34.730
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm getting an eyeball drug by</v>
<v Speaker 3>staring at this thing.</v>

2409
01:51:34.731 --> 01:51:36.860
<v Speaker 3>Like it's doing something to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically.</v>

2410
01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:38.400
<v Speaker 3>Will you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

2411
01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:41.750
<v Speaker 3>It makes you feel good to see it.</v>

2412
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:44.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm at Marble Mountain Wilderness</v>

2413
01:51:44.551 --> 01:51:45.900
<v Speaker 2>district,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's public land.</v>

2414
01:51:46.050 --> 01:51:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go there anytime you want.</v>

2415
01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:51.990
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm there,</v>

2416
01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:55.230
<v Speaker 2>what I feel like when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were at that exact same place</v>

2417
01:51:55.231 --> 01:51:57.030
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Jamie just had a picture of,</v>

2418
01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:00.960
<v Speaker 2>you feel small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel the countries big,</v>

2419
01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:05.880
<v Speaker 2>you feel insignificant really compared</v>
<v Speaker 2>to how grand the country is.</v>

2420
01:52:06.330 --> 01:52:08.430
<v Speaker 2>And for me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

2421
01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:10.020
<v Speaker 2>I think for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good,</v>

2422
01:52:10.050 --> 01:52:13.290
<v Speaker 2>it's good to feel small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people elevate themselves,</v>

2423
01:52:13.291 --> 01:52:15.840
<v Speaker 2>people make themselves more important</v>
<v Speaker 2>than they really are.</v>

2424
01:52:16.050 --> 01:52:17.760
<v Speaker 2>That's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2425
01:52:17.761 --> 01:52:21.960
<v Speaker 2>that puts you in check back there</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you realize if anything happens</v>

2426
01:52:21.961 --> 01:52:24.000
<v Speaker 2>back here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does anybody even know.</v>

2427
01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:25.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll find out,</v>

2428
01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:30.150
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just another not too much</v>
<v Speaker 2>different than an ant back here.</v>

2429
01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:32.040
<v Speaker 2>If I die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's going to change.</v>

2430
01:52:32.070 --> 01:52:34.180
<v Speaker 2>The wind's going still blow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2431
01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:36.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that lions are still going to try to</v>

2432
01:52:36.481 --> 01:52:38.850
<v Speaker 2>kill deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The elk are still going to try to breed</v>

2433
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:40.950
<v Speaker 2>nothing changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's good.</v>

2434
01:52:41.010 --> 01:52:45.000
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good to have that feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>every once in a while to realize,</v>

2435
01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:45.913
<v Speaker 2>know what?</v>

2436
01:52:46.490 --> 01:52:48.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2437
01:52:48.650 --> 01:52:50.150
<v Speaker 3>That's why I love the wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2438
01:52:50.151 --> 01:52:54.660
<v Speaker 3>there's an inescapable understanding</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>

2439
01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:59.570
<v Speaker 3>you're faced with the enormity of nature</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like everything to the left you</v>

2440
01:52:59.571 --> 01:53:01.710
<v Speaker 3>everything to the right and everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as the eye can say.</v>

2441
01:53:01.711 --> 01:53:05.660
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's all been this way for who knows</v>

2442
01:53:05.661 --> 01:53:07.880
<v Speaker 3>how long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it will be this way for who knows</v>

2443
01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:11.450
<v Speaker 3>how long after you're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just this life factory and it's</v>

2444
01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:13.700
<v Speaker 3>all going on all around you and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't care about you.</v>

2445
01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:18.530
<v Speaker 3>Now you were just an entrance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're an entrant in this weird sort of</v>

2446
01:53:18.531 --> 01:53:23.180
<v Speaker 3>a race that's going on where things are</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get by,</v>

2447
01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:26.660
<v Speaker 3>things just trying to get by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by eating all the grasses the grasses</v>

2448
01:53:26.661 --> 01:53:29.450
<v Speaker 3>are trying to get by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by producing some sort of a chemical</v>

2449
01:53:29.451 --> 01:53:31.250
<v Speaker 3>that discourages these things to eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2450
01:53:31.610 --> 01:53:34.280
<v Speaker 3>The animals are trying to run from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other animals that are trying to eat</v>

2451
01:53:34.281 --> 01:53:35.430
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2452
01:53:35.470 --> 01:53:39.980
<v Speaker 3>and we're all just hanging out watching</v>
<v Speaker 3>or participating but in,</v>

2453
01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:44.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in regular life and everybody's so</v>

2454
01:53:44.301 --> 01:53:47.930
<v Speaker 3>worried about people's feelings and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people being,</v>

2455
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:51.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fairly treated or people,</v>

2456
01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:52.700
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just like,</v>

2457
01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:53.720
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just gets.</v>

2458
01:53:53.721 --> 01:53:56.000
<v Speaker 3>So I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

2459
01:53:56.060 --> 01:53:57.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody should be treated fairly.</v>

2460
01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:00.590
<v Speaker 3>But I like when it's just black and</v>
<v Speaker 3>white.</v>

2461
01:54:00.690 --> 01:54:04.160
<v Speaker 3>I like when I'm in the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to worry about or even</v>

2462
01:54:04.190 --> 01:54:09.190
<v Speaker 3>think about everybody's cause cause of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day or I don't know.</v>

2463
01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:11.233
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2464
01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:14.750
<v Speaker 3>it puts it in perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does put it in perspective and I</v>

2465
01:54:14.751 --> 01:54:18.230
<v Speaker 3>think it would be good for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including people that are really</v>

2466
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:22.580
<v Speaker 3>invested in these causes to experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>this because I think it broadens your</v>

2467
01:54:22.581 --> 01:54:24.140
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2468
01:54:24.230 --> 01:54:26.210
<v Speaker 3>even if you're just hiking out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

2469
01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:29.270
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hunt that made me feel the most</v>

2470
01:54:29.271 --> 01:54:30.830
<v Speaker 3>thankful was an unsuccessful one.</v>

2471
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:32.720
<v Speaker 3>So while we were doing was hiking with</v>
<v Speaker 3>guns.</v>

2472
01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:35.660
<v Speaker 3>So we went hiking with guns for five</v>
<v Speaker 3>days in the rain.</v>

2473
01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:37.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I came back and I felt so goddamn</v>

2474
01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:38.600
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2475
01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:41.540
<v Speaker 3>And not just good about like the ability</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have food,</v>

2476
01:54:41.850 --> 01:54:43.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to not have to go out and hunt and kill</v>

2477
01:54:43.701 --> 01:54:46.310
<v Speaker 3>it because we were unsuccessful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>

2478
01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:49.230
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a really cool thing that we</v>

2479
01:54:49.231 --> 01:54:51.320
<v Speaker 3>figured out how to do to escape that</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

2480
01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:55.970
<v Speaker 3>that world of harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brutal nature that the tooth thing and</v>

2481
01:54:55.971 --> 01:54:59.780
<v Speaker 3>claw world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're not going to appreciate that</v>

2482
01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:01.820
<v Speaker 3>unless you go in there and there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2483
01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:04.430
<v Speaker 3>That in there though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where it gets hard.</v>

2484
01:55:05.530 --> 01:55:08.360
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to convince people like it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard to convince fat people to get off</v>

2485
01:55:08.361 --> 01:55:10.120
<v Speaker 3>the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2486
01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:14.160
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to convince people that it</v>

2487
01:55:14.210 --> 01:55:16.310
<v Speaker 3>probably would benefit them to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable.</v>

2488
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:18.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2489
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:23.060
<v Speaker 3>We're addicted to comfort for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're addicted to being uncomfortable.</v>

2490
01:55:23.150 --> 01:55:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Just makes you real fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your captain uncomfortable.</v>

2491
01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:29.640
<v Speaker 3>That's your new name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your podcast name.</v>

2492
01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>captain uncomfortable.</v>

2493
01:55:31.610 --> 01:55:33.350
<v Speaker 3>So let's talk about that because we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna.</v>

2494
01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:37.550
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna end this soon and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to start the first episode of the</v>

2495
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:39.830
<v Speaker 3>Cameron Hanes podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have to have a name for it.</v>

2496
01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 3>What did we come up with?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep hammering is a good one.</v>

2497
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

2498
01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:48.720
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the first thing that I</v>

2499
01:55:48.721 --> 01:55:52.560
<v Speaker 1>ever heard from you or about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might even heard that before I met</v>

2500
01:55:52.561 --> 01:55:53.394
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2501
01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:55.140
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this fucking dude out there</v>

2502
01:55:55.141 --> 01:55:56.450
<v Speaker 1>working and his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

2503
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:58.840
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his constant catchphrases.</v>

2504
01:55:58.860 --> 01:55:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Keep hammering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might.</v>

2505
01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing to think of.</v>

2506
01:56:02.401 --> 01:56:05.500
<v Speaker 1>If you're thinking about quitting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you think about every year even</v>

2507
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:07.650
<v Speaker 1>like I'm going to run five miles a day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that third mile I'm like,</v>

2508
01:56:07.651 --> 01:56:08.850
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 3>sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not taking in enough fat to</v>

<v Speaker 3>a lot of those steroids aren't the and</v>

2577
01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:19.330
<v Speaker 3>they require bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were acquired dead life in order to</v>

2578
01:59:19.331 --> 01:59:21.260
<v Speaker 3>create.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of it's vague,</v>

2579
01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:24.060
<v Speaker 3>they actually make testosterone for wild</v>
<v Speaker 3>yams.</v>

<v Speaker 3>hypocritical horseshit going on.</v>

2584
01:59:32.290 --> 01:59:34.510
<v Speaker 3>There's also a lot of like weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>posturing going on.</v>

2585
01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:37.780
<v Speaker 3>The part of the reason why they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is because they want to appear to be</v>

2586
01:59:37.781 --> 01:59:41.560
<v Speaker 3>very noble and it's what's called</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Sherman calls it a virtue.</v>

2587
01:59:41.561 --> 01:59:46.561

2589
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:50.770
<v Speaker 3>Like there was signaling to the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>around them,</v>

2590
01:59:51.130 --> 01:59:53.960
<v Speaker 3>sort of like when an elk bugles is to</v>
<v Speaker 3>let all the other elk.</v>

2591
01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:55.630

<v Speaker 3>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2592
01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:56.473
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2593
01:59:56.560 --> 01:59:59.940

<v Speaker 3>which is a,</v>

2594
01:59:59.941 --> 02:00:02.560
<v Speaker 3>like you're gonna if you have an anti</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunter post,</v>

2595
02:00:02.710 --> 02:00:06.130
<v Speaker 3>you're absolutely going to have a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people to take your side.</v>

2596
02:00:06.131 --> 02:00:07.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck those people.</v>

2597
02:00:07.331 --> 02:00:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they also get to see how good your</v>

2598
02:00:09.581 --> 02:00:12.040
<v Speaker 3>six pack looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you say fuck those people,</v>

2599
02:00:12.041 --> 02:00:15.340
<v Speaker 3>but you're also oil down and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

2600
02:00:15.341 --> 02:00:17.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cruelty free,</v>

02:00:20.591 --> 02:00:23.260
<v Speaker 3>you're like overhead pressing a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight,</v>

2603
02:00:23.261 --> 02:00:26.680
<v Speaker 3>you look sleek and you probably get some</v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy that way and that's what these</v>

2604
02:00:26.681 --> 02:00:27.370
<v Speaker 3>guys are doing.</v>

2605
02:00:27.370 --> 02:00:30.520
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a coincidence that some of the</v>

2606
02:00:30.521 --> 02:00:34.900
<v Speaker 3>contest fucks are also some of the ones</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are the most into their physiques.</v>

2607
02:00:34.930 --> 02:00:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're doing.</v>

2608
02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:40.600
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you if you got those guys</v>

2609
02:00:40.601 --> 02:00:43.660
<v Speaker 3>alone with no one watching and he had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with them,</v>

2610
02:00:43.661 --> 02:00:46.390
<v Speaker 3>they would fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you their arguments would</v>

2611
02:00:46.391 --> 02:00:49.030
<v Speaker 3>fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their motivations would fall apart if</v>

2612
02:00:49.031 --> 02:00:50.860
<v Speaker 3>there's no one there to cheer them on or</v>
<v Speaker 3>help them.</v>

2613
02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:53.260
<v Speaker 3>He actually got to see them as a human</v>
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

2614
02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:58.110
<v Speaker 3>Having a communication with you as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>human being about why it is that you're</v>

2615
02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:01.720
<v Speaker 3>spreading this kind of hate and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get into the very specifics of this and</v>

2616
02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:06.721
<v Speaker 3>you realize this argument is long and</v>
<v Speaker 3>vast and super complex.</v>

2617
02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:10.300
<v Speaker 3>You guys are trying to make it look like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not trying to make it look like you</v>

2618
02:01:10.301 --> 02:01:12.130
<v Speaker 3>eating that salad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the best ever.</v>

2619
02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:13.750
<v Speaker 3>You're super awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2620
02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:16.360

<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2621
02:01:16.370 --> 02:01:19.900
<v Speaker 3>That's why you're better than people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do what you do.</v>

2622
02:01:19.930 --> 02:01:21.520
<v Speaker 3>Even though you just started doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>four months ago.</v>

2623
02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:22.583
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2624
02:01:24.670 --> 02:01:27.520
<v Speaker 3>So irritated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the video of the dude who</v>

2625
02:01:27.521 --> 02:01:30.790
<v Speaker 3>was a eating a pizza?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got cheese in it and he fucking</v>

2626
02:01:30.791 --> 02:01:33.340
<v Speaker 3>freaks out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a Vegan and he's talking about how</v>

2627
02:01:33.341 --> 02:01:37.060
<v Speaker 3>awesome it is to be Vegan and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>realizes in the middle of the video that</v>

2628
02:01:37.061 --> 02:01:39.800
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pizza has cheese and sauce with it</v>

2629
02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:41.330
<v Speaker 3>and he goes ballistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2630
02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:43.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's a long video.</v>

2631
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:45.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just.</v>

2632
02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:48.730
<v Speaker 3>He throws his phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He screamed and yelled.</v>

2633
02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:50.470
<v Speaker 3>He's so angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the,</v>

2634
02:01:50.530 --> 02:01:54.290
<v Speaker 3>in the video he's talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't say that you're a good person</v>

2635
02:01:54.291 --> 02:01:57.650
<v Speaker 3>if you're not vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't say that you're a person who</v>

2636
02:01:57.651 --> 02:01:59.630
<v Speaker 3>tries to be a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2637
02:01:59.631 --> 02:02:01.040
<v Speaker 3>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why aren't you Vegan?</v>

2638
02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:04.040
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy.</v>

2639
02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:05.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking nailed it.</v>

2640
02:02:05.331 --> 02:02:06.910
<v Speaker 3>You made it so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2641
02:02:06.911 --> 02:02:10.910
<v Speaker 3>Well his mom ordered the pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was just a misunderstanding.</v>

2642
02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:13.700
<v Speaker 3>It's very hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is a guy.</v>

2643
02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:17.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like we'd have to play this band</v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

2644
02:02:17.011 --> 02:02:18.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to shit on this guy.</v>

2645
02:02:18.530 --> 02:02:21.430
<v Speaker 3>You can go find it if you want folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to play it or shit on this</v>

2646
02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:22.940
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just a young kid.</v>

2647
02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:26.120
<v Speaker 3>He's got his ideas and maybe in his mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's right,</v>

2648
02:02:26.630 --> 02:02:31.630
<v Speaker 3>but I just found the folly and watching</v>
<v Speaker 3>him freak out over some cheese.</v>

2649
02:02:33.210 --> 02:02:35.060
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cows or look,</v>

2650
02:02:35.061 --> 02:02:37.220
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want something to be upset about</v>

2651
02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:41.300
<v Speaker 3>rather than hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is absolutely the fucking dairy</v>

2652
02:02:41.301 --> 02:02:46.190
<v Speaker 3>industry and agricultural gag laws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These AG gag lungs that don't allow you</v>

2653
02:02:46.191 --> 02:02:49.850
<v Speaker 3>to film these chicken factories where</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things are stuffed into these</v>

2654
02:02:49.851 --> 02:02:52.490
<v Speaker 3>horrible conditions or pig factories or</v>
<v Speaker 3>factory farming.</v>

2655
02:02:53.010 --> 02:02:56.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm 100 percent with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is one of the worst aspects</v>

2656
02:02:56.631 --> 02:03:00.140
<v Speaker 3>of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way we acquire our protein and</v>

2657
02:03:00.141 --> 02:03:02.570
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's another real problem and a</v>

2658
02:03:02.571 --> 02:03:04.700
<v Speaker 3>contradiction and for guys like you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2659
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:06.470
<v Speaker 3>we don't really have an argument against</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2660
02:03:06.890 --> 02:03:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Not Everybody can hunt and if you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to eat meat and you want to do it in an</v>

2661
02:03:11.181 --> 02:03:14.180
<v Speaker 3>ethical way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you you have a real dilemma that they</v>

2662
02:03:14.181 --> 02:03:16.940
<v Speaker 3>are pointing out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that by point,</v>

2663
02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.990
<v Speaker 3>by going against hunters though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2664
02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:22.010
<v Speaker 3>they're missing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're missing the mark in a big,</v>

2665
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.940
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big way.</v>

2666
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:25.580
<v Speaker 3>You're missing the mark in a giant wet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not the enemy.</v>

2667
02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:26.493
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

2668
02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:29.690
<v Speaker 3>But I mean if you do want to eat me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2669
02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:32.000
<v Speaker 3>you don't hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are place.</v>

2670
02:03:32.001 --> 02:03:36.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean my buddy Adam La Roche owns a</v>
<v Speaker 3>three ranch and that's a free range.</v>

2671
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do it.</v>

2672
02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:40.940
<v Speaker 3>It can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's expensive and you're not going</v>

2673
02:03:40.941 --> 02:03:45.050
<v Speaker 3>to get it at Mcdonald's and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want a quick cheeseburger and you</v>

2674
02:03:45.051 --> 02:03:46.580
<v Speaker 3>want to pull into that Wendy's drive</v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

2675
02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:48.890
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to put those fucking those</v>

2676
02:03:48.891 --> 02:03:50.350
<v Speaker 3>ethical blinders on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2677
02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:51.370
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2678
02:03:51.710 --> 02:03:54.620
<v Speaker 3>And they're in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a break from ethics that day.</v>

2679
02:03:55.130 --> 02:03:56.270
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in that sense,</v>

2680
02:03:56.300 --> 02:04:00.470
<v Speaker 3>all these vegans are right in that sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're talking about how animals</v>

2681
02:04:00.471 --> 02:04:02.990
<v Speaker 3>are being treated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we're getting our milk from and</v>

2682
02:04:02.991 --> 02:04:06.260
<v Speaker 3>our cheese from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in most of these large scale</v>

2683
02:04:06.261 --> 02:04:07.680
<v Speaker 3>factories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there,</v>

2684
02:04:07.730 --> 02:04:09.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're 100 percent right?</v>

2685
02:04:09.201 --> 02:04:12.080
<v Speaker 3>And I'm with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that this whole</v>

2686
02:04:12.081 --> 02:04:17.081
<v Speaker 3>conversation is really about human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings and civilization itself and our</v>

2687
02:04:18.321 --> 02:04:23.321
<v Speaker 3>ability to diffuse responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our ability to detach ourselves and just</v>

2688
02:04:25.161 --> 02:04:27.980
<v Speaker 3>like we're talking about these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that consume grain and don't think about</v>

2689
02:04:27.981 --> 02:04:29.570
<v Speaker 3>the consequences of life.</v>

2690
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:32.900
<v Speaker 3>These people that consume all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetables that are used,</v>

2691
02:04:32.901 --> 02:04:34.940
<v Speaker 3>that pesticides are used,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are killing off bs.</v>

2692
02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:37.650
<v Speaker 3>This is a huge issue that you contribute</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

2693
02:04:37.651 --> 02:04:38.830
<v Speaker 3>I do all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

2694
02:04:39.190 --> 02:04:42.930
<v Speaker 3>all the people that we know that eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>fruits and vegetables most likely having</v>

2695
02:04:42.931 --> 02:04:47.220
<v Speaker 3>some way contributed to the large scale</v>
<v Speaker 3>death of a lot of different insects and</v>

2696
02:04:47.221 --> 02:04:49.470
<v Speaker 3>animals is just a part of being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

2697
02:04:49.860 --> 02:04:53.520
<v Speaker 3>And you can't deny that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you try to deny that and say,</v>

2698
02:04:53.521 --> 02:04:55.230
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to do the least harm</v>

2699
02:04:55.231 --> 02:04:56.520
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

2700
02:04:56.670 --> 02:04:58.890
<v Speaker 3>That's like trying to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a serial killer,</v>

2701
02:04:59.070 --> 02:05:02.820
<v Speaker 3>but I only like to kill once a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got this fucking guy argued with me</v>

2702
02:05:02.821 --> 02:05:04.170
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things he was arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's guy,</v>

2703
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:06.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm 90 percent vegetarian.</v>

2704
02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that me,</v>

2705
02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:12.100
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the same thing.</v>

2706
02:05:12.170 --> 02:05:14.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the same thing as saying you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan.</v>

2707
02:05:14.890 --> 02:05:18.640
<v Speaker 1>I am to six hours and I'm sleeping total</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian.</v>

2708
02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>So what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 25 percent.</v>

2709
02:05:21.700 --> 02:05:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not eating at all during that</v>

2710
02:05:22.841 --> 02:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2711
02:05:23.410 --> 02:05:24.750
<v Speaker 1>You're an Eriterian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2712
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm better than him,</v>

2713
02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:29.260
<v Speaker 1>but if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you contributing to death,</v>

2714
02:05:29.770 --> 02:05:32.680
<v Speaker 1>then you really can't say anything and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's contributing to death.</v>

2715
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:35.620
<v Speaker 1>If you live in a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your house was made out of wood,</v>

2716
02:05:35.950 --> 02:05:40.950
<v Speaker 1>if trees were fell to build your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals died.</v>

2717
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what Michael p dot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2718
02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:46.000
<v Speaker 3>And their habitat was displaced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do you know what Michael Pollan</v>

2719
02:05:46.001 --> 02:05:47.710
<v Speaker 3>says?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy who wrote that book,</v>

2720
02:05:47.711 --> 02:05:48.910
<v Speaker 3>the Omnivore's dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

2721
02:05:48.911 --> 02:05:52.810
<v Speaker 3>very fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that they have done research</v>

2722
02:05:52.811 --> 02:05:57.811
<v Speaker 3>where they have played the sound of</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals eating leaves and plants next to</v>

2723
02:05:59.591 --> 02:06:04.591
<v Speaker 3>plants and somehow or another the very</v>
<v Speaker 3>sound of those animals eating plants</v>

2724
02:06:06.370 --> 02:06:10.000
<v Speaker 3>causes the plants to excrete defensive</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemicals.</v>

2725
02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:12.700
<v Speaker 3>So somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these plants,</v>

2726
02:06:13.030 --> 02:06:15.610
<v Speaker 3>they're not just feeling that someone's</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating them,</v>

2727
02:06:15.780 --> 02:06:20.020
<v Speaker 3>they are hearing it and they're aware</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're reacting to sound.</v>

2728
02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:25.200
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm sort of a strange way that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>commensurate with the way an animal</v>

2729
02:06:25.571 --> 02:06:28.300
<v Speaker 3>reacts to danger in some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange way.</v>

2730
02:06:28.330 --> 02:06:32.170
<v Speaker 3>He also says that they produce some</v>
<v Speaker 3>human neurochemistry chemicals like</v>

2731
02:06:32.171 --> 02:06:33.650
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin and dopamine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2732
02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:36.820
<v Speaker 3>they produce commensurate chemicals and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know why.</v>

2733
02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:38.530
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then.</v>

2734
02:06:39.070 --> 02:06:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Crazy fucking nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nuts.</v>

2735
02:06:42.530 --> 02:06:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to read it like three or four</v>

2736
02:06:44.021 --> 02:06:44.741
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2737
02:06:44.741 --> 02:06:49.741
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They played sounds of animals eating</v>

2738
02:06:49.871 --> 02:06:52.000
<v Speaker 3>plants next to the plants and the plants</v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

2739
02:06:53.670 --> 02:06:55.500
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a pretty barbaric to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2740
02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:57.090
<v Speaker 1>It's rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2741
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Either one,</v>

2742
02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:58.970
<v Speaker 3>don't eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't torture them.</v>

2743
02:06:58.971 --> 02:07:01.160
<v Speaker 3>First it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2744
02:07:01.161 --> 02:07:03.860
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't kill cows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but before you kill them,</v>

2745
02:07:03.861 --> 02:07:05.660
<v Speaker 3>you play this horrible sound.</v>

2746
02:07:05.950 --> 02:07:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other cows getting killed?</v>

2747
02:07:08.621 --> 02:07:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2748
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:12.130
<v Speaker 3>The bad news for Vegetarians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plants can hear themselves being eaten</v>

2749
02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:15.910
<v Speaker 3>and become defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When attached attacked researchers from</v>

2750
02:07:15.911 --> 02:07:18.490
<v Speaker 3>the University of Missouri found plants</v>
<v Speaker 3>respond to attack.</v>

2751
02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:22.660
<v Speaker 3>They discovered that the sound of</v>
<v Speaker 3>caterpillars eating made them more</v>

2752
02:07:22.661 --> 02:07:26.800
<v Speaker 3>defensive and plants that heard</v>
<v Speaker 3>caterpillar sounds released more mustard</v>

2753
02:07:26.801 --> 02:07:30.460
<v Speaker 3>oils which are unappealing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>caterpillars and thus ward them off.</v>

2754
02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:32.680
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

2755
02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:36.610
<v Speaker 3>But plants that heard the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite having similar acoustic sound,</v>

2756
02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:39.040
<v Speaker 3>knew not to waste their defensive</v>
<v Speaker 3>capabilities.</v>

2757
02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Although this suggests that plants are</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to identify sounds in their</v>

2758
02:07:43.961 --> 02:07:45.880
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense,</v>

2759
02:07:45.881 --> 02:07:48.070
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't give it a second</v>

2760
02:07:48.071 --> 02:07:50.080
<v Speaker 3>thought when they're tucking into a</v>
<v Speaker 3>plate of salad,</v>

2761
02:07:50.081 --> 02:07:53.260
<v Speaker 3>but perhaps we should be a bit more</v>
<v Speaker 3>considerate when chomping on lettuce.</v>

2762
02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:55.060
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists have found that plants</v>

2763
02:07:55.061 --> 02:07:57.810
<v Speaker 3>actually respond defensively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just need to accept the fact that</v>

2764
02:07:57.811 --> 02:08:00.190
<v Speaker 3>life eats life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life eats life is to it.</v>

2765
02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:02.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't allow you to be</v>

2766
02:08:02.651 --> 02:08:05.770
<v Speaker 3>sanctimonious or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or to take the moral high ground.</v>

2767
