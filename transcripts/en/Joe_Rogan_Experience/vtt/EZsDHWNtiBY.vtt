<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I gave him a response and I didn't think nothing of it,</v>

22
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>but then I saw a lot of people responded and I was like,</v>

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>The other people were asking me questions and then now it's like,</v>

26
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:39.804
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.350
<v Speaker 1>you want him to ask.</v>

38
00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Somebody asked me.</v>

39
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>and that's Kinda how I looked at it.</v>

41
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

42
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>it ended up being this thing.</v>

44
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>But then I know that you talk about psychedelics and you have specifically</v>

45
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>talked about DMT,</v>

46
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>cause I answered the question about Dmt and that's why I was like,</v>

47
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:09.991
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

48
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>we should talk about this with Joe.</v>

49
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.541
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

50
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>cause I know that I,</v>

51
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can't sit down with anybody and talk about the empty,</v>

52
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>even some of my friends,</v>

53
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>I've told them that I've done it and they've like looked at me in a way where</v>

54
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:21.654
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

55
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:23.431
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

57
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:24.264
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

58
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.253
<v Speaker 1>you did duty.</v>

59
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a game changer,</v>

60
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.761
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

61
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:27.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

62
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Pete,</v>

63
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

64
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>But that lets me know that there's people that don't understand it and they're</v>

65
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>not educated about it.</v>

66
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:33.920
<v Speaker 1>And so they just kind of hear these stories and uh,</v>

67
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 1>that's all I was like,</v>

68
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:35.551
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

69
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>it would be dope to if we just sat down and talked about it and educate some</v>

70
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>people because I just know it's,</v>

71
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean even some people are scared of acid.</v>

72
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a scary thing,</v>

73
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:44.964
<v Speaker 1>I tell people,</v>

75
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I remember this is a true story.</v>

76
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

77
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.013
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

78
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.023
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

79
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of like one of those things where,</v>

80
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:55.740

82
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:56.221
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

83
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>it's just a reality.</v>

84
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.861
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

85
00:01:57.861 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

94
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.981

<v Speaker 1>you want to try to find a common ground.</v>

150
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Cause everybody tripping,</v>

151
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.981
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

152
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:33.814
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

153
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.971
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

155
00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day we just tripping.</v>

156
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.350
<v Speaker 1>And it's scary because somebody gets to be like woman minute.</v>

157
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to kill me.</v>

158
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

159
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.263
<v Speaker 1>it's so</v>

160
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.653
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

161
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I've never had no shit like that.</v>

162
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 1>And I'm pretty sure people have dealt with that though.</v>

163
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

164
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.720
<v Speaker 2>and the second thing is,</v>

165
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.500
<v Speaker 2>and this is what the,</v>

166
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.720
<v Speaker 2>this is the real problem I think in higher education,</v>

167
00:03:53.721 --> 00:03:54.201
<v Speaker 2>which makes me,</v>

168
00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:57.440
<v Speaker 2>it makes me crazy every single day is that right now,</v>

169
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.150
<v Speaker 2>higher ed in particular in the social sciences and humanities is on lockdown by</v>

170
00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:03.320
<v Speaker 2>the academic left.</v>

171
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

172
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.560
<v Speaker 2>And I come out of the left and I'm left wing in a lot of ways.</v>

173
00:04:06.561 --> 00:04:07.460
<v Speaker 2>And in some ways I'm not.</v>

174
00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:12.461
<v Speaker 2>But what I hate is that there's just almost no variety of discourse on college</v>

175
00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 2>campuses that pretty much it.</v>

176
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:17.210
<v Speaker 2>And if there's been studies done,</v>

177
00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:21.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean like 95% of English and history professors voted for Obama.</v>

178
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

179
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean that tells you right there that there's not a whole lot of debate going</v>

180
00:04:24.381 --> 00:04:24.950
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

181
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that is?</v>

182
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.451
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

183
00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:31.451
<v Speaker 2>why is academia and the left sort of inexorably connected?</v>

184
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:31.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

185
00:04:31.731 --> 00:04:31.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

186
00:04:31.941 --> 00:04:35.030
<v Speaker 2>so when a lot of left academics are asked this,</v>

187
00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:37.670
<v Speaker 2>the answer that they give you is we're smarter,</v>

188
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.570
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

189
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.830
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

190
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.550
<v Speaker 2>So that we,</v>

191
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.241
<v Speaker 2>it's just in tiff,</v>

192
00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:42.230
<v Speaker 2>you're intelligent and study,</v>

193
00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:43.280
<v Speaker 2>you will come to that position.</v>

194
00:04:43.281 --> 00:04:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Now I said it because right.</v>

195
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Is kinda inexorably connected to religion because Christianity and the right are</v>

196
00:04:50.181 --> 00:04:51.290
<v Speaker 2>pretty much inseparable.</v>

197
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.160
<v Speaker 2>But even point,</v>

198
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.610
<v Speaker 2>even libertarians who are atheists get run out of the house,</v>

199
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.170
<v Speaker 2>you can't get a job as a libertarian.</v>

200
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.183
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

201
00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

202
00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.301
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

203
00:04:59.301 --> 00:04:59.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

204
00:04:59.541 --> 00:05:00.251
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

205
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:01.280
<v Speaker 2>it's all historical,</v>

206
00:05:01.281 --> 00:05:01.581
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

207
00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:03.590
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the history of higher education,</v>

208
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.970
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people forget this,</v>

209
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

210
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.390
<v Speaker 2>a higher education in this country is only about two centuries old.</v>

211
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.340
<v Speaker 2>And as a major mass institution,</v>

212
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:11.174
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

213
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

214
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.430
<v Speaker 2>the right,</v>

215
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.970
<v Speaker 2>right wing conservatives controlled the joint until the 1960s.</v>

216
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.271
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

217
00:05:17.271 --> 00:05:21.650
<v Speaker 2>So what was being taught at Harvard and Yale and Princeton and cow and Ucla,</v>

218
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

219
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.380
<v Speaker 2>was things like capitalism is awesome and black people are inferior and women</v>

220
00:05:27.381 --> 00:05:28.250
<v Speaker 2>should be in the home.</v>

221
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.551
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

222
00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

223
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.250
<v Speaker 2>the Conservatives had that whole place on lockdown.</v>

224
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

225
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.530
<v Speaker 2>there was a monoculture on,</v>

226
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.221
<v Speaker 2>on the campuses.</v>

227
00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Then what comes along is the 1960s and all those movements,</v>

228
00:05:37.611 --> 00:05:38.600
<v Speaker 2>although social movements,</v>

229
00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:39.560
<v Speaker 2>so the antiwar movement,</v>

230
00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:40.430
<v Speaker 2>the civil rights movement,</v>

231
00:05:40.431 --> 00:05:41.121
<v Speaker 2>feminist movement,</v>

232
00:05:41.121 --> 00:05:41.451
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

233
00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:42.284
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

234
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.850
<v Speaker 2>And what happened was those people,</v>

235
00:05:43.851 --> 00:05:47.540
<v Speaker 2>because their movements either sort of succeeded and they considered were</v>

236
00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:51.410
<v Speaker 2>considered to be done or they couldn't succeed,</v>

237
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.720
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't really create a radical revolution,</v>

238
00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:54.620
<v Speaker 2>the kind that they wanted.</v>

239
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 2>The only place they found that they could go and have a job was colleges as</v>

240
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:00.081
<v Speaker 2>professors.</v>

241
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

242
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 2>on Moss though that generation,</v>

243
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 2>the new left of the 1960s went into graduate school and they all became</v>

244
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 2>professors and that's,</v>

245
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 2>he's been basically teaching college for the last 50 years.</v>

246
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

247
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

248
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm of the generation that was trained by them.</v>

249
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:17.041
<v Speaker 2>And so there,</v>

250
00:06:17.041 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 2>there's some changes going on,</v>

251
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 2>but basically most,</v>

252
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 2>even most people my age,</v>

253
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:21.771
<v Speaker 2>I'm in my forties,</v>

254
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 2>but in my generation,</v>

255
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 2>most of us are still sort of influenced by that generation.</v>

256
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 2>So it was this very concerted,</v>

257
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 2>not a conspiracy,</v>

258
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 2>but it was a pretty deliberate attempt in some ways.</v>

259
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 2>It was conscious to take over the university that that was the,</v>

260
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 2>that was the only place we could have this radical discourse and get paid for it</v>

261
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 2>and have a career.</v>

262
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

263
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 3>I never wanted a late night talk show.</v>

264
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 3>It just ended up being,</v>

265
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 3>that was the format that they called it.</v>

266
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 3>Like I just wanted to show and they said it comes on at a law after 11 and I'm</v>

267
00:06:48.111 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 3>like okay,</v>

268
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.513
<v Speaker 3>come on at eight.</v>

269
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 3>But there's a thing if there's a person who's standing on a stage talking to an</v>

270
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 3>audience about the world and it's a late night talk show and I was always sort</v>

271
00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:02.600
<v Speaker 3>of rebelling against that format and trying to make it just a show that I would</v>

272
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 3>want to watch.</v>

273
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

274
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.960
<v Speaker 3>Well I think you did a good job at doing that.</v>

275
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

276
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.840
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

277
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.780
<v Speaker 3>when a show is on a network,</v>

278
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 3>there's always going to be like a bunch of people that are also trying to change</v>

279
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:14.201
<v Speaker 3>the direction.</v>

280
00:07:14.201 --> 00:07:18.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm it like you got your ideas and then you got your producers ideas,</v>

281
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:19.930
<v Speaker 3>which ad hopefully to your ideas,</v>

282
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.050
<v Speaker 3>the director's ideas was added and then you've got an executives and hey man,</v>

283
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking kick cooks in the kitchen.</v>

284
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

285
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.051
<v Speaker 3>you absolutely do.</v>

286
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:30.020
<v Speaker 3>And that coming from the world of standup and also the world zoom,</v>

287
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 3>I like the solo show that got me the thing.</v>

288
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.620
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

289
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 3>I had friends helping me and I had people help me.</v>

290
00:07:34.461 --> 00:07:35.271
<v Speaker 3>But it was ultimately,</v>

291
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:38.270
<v Speaker 3>it was my words were the thing that we're coming out of my mouth and my idea,</v>

292
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.050
<v Speaker 3>nobody,</v>

293
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.681
<v Speaker 3>people could say,</v>

294
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:40.120
<v Speaker 3>what should you,</v>

295
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.581
<v Speaker 3>you should do this.</v>

296
00:07:40.581 --> 00:07:40.911
<v Speaker 3>And I'd be like,</v>

297
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:41.061
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

298
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 3>I'll think about it.</v>

299
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 3>But when you're in that,</v>

300
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.750
<v Speaker 3>in that meat grinder environment,</v>

301
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 3>especially when it became daily,</v>

302
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 3>there's so many people who are sort of yelling things at you and at some point</v>

303
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:49.671
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

304
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 3>for lack of,</v>

305
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

306
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.950
<v Speaker 3>if you can't top their idea,</v>

307
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 3>you sort of go,</v>

308
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 3>I guess we'll do that.</v>

309
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

310
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.920
<v Speaker 3>Or,</v>

311
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 3>or if somebody goes,</v>

312
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.481
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

313
00:07:56.481 --> 00:07:56.991
<v Speaker 3>I just told him,</v>

314
00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:57.510
<v Speaker 3>I said this yesterday,</v>

315
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.343
<v Speaker 3>like somebody will be like,</v>

316
00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:58.641
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

317
00:07:58.641 --> 00:07:58.970
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

318
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking we could do a cold open.</v>

319
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

320
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't really want to do a cold open cause that's just not the kind of show I</v>

321
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:02.870
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

322
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:03.111
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

323
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:03.830
<v Speaker 3>I think if we have,</v>

324
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 3>we have a big guest on,</v>

325
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:05.421
<v Speaker 3>we'll do the cold open.</v>

326
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:05.511
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

327
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't really want to do that.</v>

328
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:06.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

329
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.341
<v Speaker 3>I asked the guests,</v>

330
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:08.174
<v Speaker 3>he wants to do it.</v>

331
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:08.871
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

332
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 3>I guess we'll do it.</v>

333
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.390
<v Speaker 3>And then the guest shows up and he goes,</v>

334
00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:11.990
<v Speaker 3>we're doing this called over.</v>

335
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.171
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

336
00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:12.741
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do it.</v>

337
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 3>And you go,</v>

338
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:13.251
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

339
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:16.370
<v Speaker 3>but we already bought the whipped cream and then suddenly had this vision of</v>

340
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:17.120
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

341
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.230
<v Speaker 3>why are we doing this?</v>

342
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.970
<v Speaker 3>Why we are,</v>

343
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.380
<v Speaker 3>it's just there's this machine of television and this machine that suddenly</v>

344
00:08:25.381 --> 00:08:26.660
<v Speaker 3>you're just as you either.</v>

345
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:27.973
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I was,</v>

346
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.770
<v Speaker 3>it was like a meat grinder and either I was putting the meat in the grinder or I</v>

347
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:31.970
<v Speaker 3>was the meat for the grinder.</v>

348
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.230
<v Speaker 3>And in that format,</v>

349
00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:33.891
<v Speaker 3>when it was daily,</v>

350
00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:35.090
<v Speaker 3>a lot of days I was the meat.</v>
